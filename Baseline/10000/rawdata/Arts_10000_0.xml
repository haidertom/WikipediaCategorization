[[File:Portraits of the three engravers of Fuchs' 'De Historia...' Wellcome L0035316.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Heinrich Füllmauer, Albrecht Meyer, and Veit Rudolf Speckle]]
'''Albrecht Meyer''' also known as '''Albertus Meyer''' in Latinised form, was a botanical illustrator noted for his more than 500 plant images in [[Leonhart Fuchs]]'s epic pre-Linnean publication of 1542, ''[[De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes]]'', published in Latin and Greek, and almost immediately translated into German. At the time it was regarded as one of the most beautifully illustrated books on plants and a jewel in the crown of [[German Renaissance]].

==Collaborations==
Meyer collaborated with the painter Heinricus Füllmaurer and the engraver Veit Rudolph Speckle (d.12 December 1550 Straßburg) in producing the woodcuts for the book, which, unusually for its time, named the contributing artists and included their portraits. Fuchs, whose herbal had been inspired by [[Brunfels]]'s work "''Herbarum vivae imagines''" which had appeared twelve years earlier, praised the illustrations as having been carried out with 'great diligence and artifice', and went on to state that 'shading and other less crucial things with which painters sometimes strive for artistic glory' had been shunned in order to make the images truer to nature. The book appeared in both coloured and uncoloured versions. Fuchs planned for the illustrations to be coloured and did not want their appearance disfigured by excessive shading. Although some copies of the work were issued as coloured, many were worked on after publication. The text, like that of Brunfels', was taken from ancient authors.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/earlynaturalists00mialuoft "Early Naturalists" (1912) - Louis Compton Miall]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Cambridge History of Science" vol3 - Katharine Park, Lorraine Daston&lt;/ref&gt; "De Historia" continued a long tradition of herbals - books describing the medicinal uses of plants - but broke with tradition by using lifelike illustrations rather than the schematic and often fanciful representations.

The remarkably detailed woodcuts include the first published images of over 100 new plants from the Americas, such as pumpkin, marigold, maize, squash, chili peppers and tobacco – native to [[Mexico]] and brought to Europe from the [[New World]]. Leonhart Fuchs was a child prodigy, matriculating from [[Erfurt University]] by the age of twelve, and then obtaining a degree in medicine at [[Ingolstadt]]. He rendered outstanding medical service during the 1529 [[Sweating sickness#1528|Sweating Sickness plague]]. The illustrations were drawn from nature by Albert Meyer, using mature plants which Fuchs often provided from his garden in [[Tübingen]]. The accuracy of the plates which show the flowers, roots and the plant habit, led to its being used as a reference work by European physicians and many famous herbaria of the sixteenth century, notably that of [[Dodoens]]. [[William Morris]], the English artist and designer, possessed a copy of the book and some of his designs drew inspiration from the plates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.si.edu/Exhibitions/Voyages/all-items.htm Smithsonian Institution Libraries]&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Historia" was published in a German language folio edition a year after the original. The folio editions were bulky and difficult to use, and smaller, pocket editions soon appeared. During Fuchs' lifetime the book went through thirty-nine imprints in Latin, German, French, Spanish and Dutch. The woodblocks were used and copied for a further three hundred years. Fuchs laboured on a greatly expanded version of the work for the final twenty-four years of his life. The manuscript of this work, which was never published, is preserved in the [[Austrian National Library]] and is dubbed the 'Vienna Codex'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/oct2002.html Glasgow University Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425163720/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/exhibns/month/oct2002.html |date=2013-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Commons category|Albrecht Meyer}}

'''The Book of Cynog''' ({{lang-lat-med|Liber Knauc}}; {{lang-wlm|Llyfr Kynawc}}; {{lang-cy|Llyfr Cynog}}) was a text of [[medieval Wales|medieval]] [[Welsh law]].&lt;ref&gt;Wade-Evans, Arthur. ''Welsh Medieval Law'', [[s:Page:Welsh Medieval Law.djvu/445|p. 343]].&lt;/ref&gt; It is quoted extensively by surviving sources but does not appear to have survived intact. However, the first 75 folios of Peniarth MS. 35 seem to be a medieval attempt to reconstruct the earlier book.&lt;ref&gt;Wiliam, Aled Rhys.

==Corporate history==
The company was founded in 2000 by Douglas Ross, who had previously run a computer systems company, and Andrew Bilinski, who had worked for the [[US Air Force]], [[Electronic Data Systems|EDS]] &amp; BDM International.  Ross originally come up with the idea for Booksfree in 1999, and after selling his company was looking at what to do next.  [[United States dollar|US$]]1 million of start-up funding was provided by friends &amp; associates.  In 2008, Booksfree was recognized by Inc. Magazine as one of America’s top 5,000 fastest growing privately held companies.  In February 2009 they shipped their 2 millionth book.  In May 2010, the company launched a complementary online book and audiobook swap service [http://www.booksfreeswap.com BooksfreeSwap].  The free book swap service was developed in response to customer demand for books and audiobooks that were not available through their rental service.  An audiobook download and streaming service [http://www.audiobooksnow.com AudiobooksNow] was started by Booksfree in January 2012 to meet the growing demand for digital content.  On November 2, 2016 Booksfree rebranded itself as [http://www.booklender.com BookLender].  The company felt the name BookLender better represents what the company does.&lt;ref name="FairfaxTimes20070411" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WashPost20021002"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Bookmobile Reinvented; Va.

Titles are offered in [[paperback]], [[compact disc|CD]] &amp; [[MP3]] CD [[audiobook]] formats.  Separate monthly membership plans are offered for each medium starting at $9.99 for books, $12.99 for MP3-CD audiobooks &amp; $22.49 for CD &amp; MP3 CD audiobooks.

'''''Boy with a Glass and a Lute''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted in 1626 and now in the [[Guildhall Art Gallery]], [[London]].

==Painting ==
The [[painting]] shows a boy with a lute who is holding a glass above his head with his right hand; with his left hand, he balances a lute which rests on a table.

==Name==
In his 1910 catalog of Frans Hals works [[Hofstede de Groot]] wrote: "82. THE LAUGHING MANDOLINE-PLAYER. M. 214. A young man with long dishevelled hair sits holding up in his right hand a glass full of wine, at which he looks with a smile. His dark costume is trimmed with blue ; his cap hangs on the back of his head, to the left. With his left hand he holds up one end of a mandoline, the other end of which rests on a table. Signed on the right with the monogram ; panel, 36 inches by 30 inches.

Exhibited at the Royal Academy Winter Exhibition, London, 1891, No. 72."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn03hofsuoft#page/22/mode/1up Hofstede de Groot] on The Laughing Mandolin Player; catalog number 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Hals' positioning of a figure looking upwards was common to many of his genre paintings of the 1620s:
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:Boy Playing A Violin hq.jpg|''Boy Playing A Violin'', today attributed to the "Master of the upward glance" or "School of [[Judith Leyster]] and Frans Hals"
&lt;/gallery&gt;

This painting is probably related to ''[[The Fingernail Test]]'':

'''The Brew House Association''' is an [[artist collective]] established in 1991 in the [[South Side Flats]] neighborhood of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It is located at Mary and 21st Streets in a multi-story building that once housed the [[Duquesne Brewing Company]]. The lower floors of the building have been converted to gallery and theater space, including SPACE 101, an alternative exhibit gallery founded by the Brew House Association in 1994, while the upper floors have become studio and living areas for resident artists, and shared workshops for [[welding]] and [[pottery]]. The Brew House and the abandoned industrial lots around it have been the site of [[performance art]], [[theatre]] and [[sculpture]] exhibits. They formerly rented studio space and hosted a residency program for [[visual artist]]s before issues with building code violations forced them to temporarily close their doors in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Brew House Association|url=http://pittsburgharts.org/brew-house-association-call-proposals-2013|publisher=Pittsburgh Arts|quote=The Brew House Association operates within the original Duquesne Brewing facility founded in 1899.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020075612/http://pittsburgharts.org/brew-house-association-call-proposals-2013|archivedate=2014-10-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Schooley|title=South Side Brew House to be renovated into 75 apartments|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/news/2014/03/03/south-side-brew-house-to-be-renovated.html|publisher=Pittsburgh Business Times|date=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Charles Rosenblum|title=Brew House artists are renovating their South Side home, but not changing their mission|url=http://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/brew-house-artists-are-renovating-their-south-side-home-but-not-changing-their-mission/Content?oid=1736019|publisher=Pittsburgh City Paper|date=March 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Broken Blossoms or The Yellow Man and the Girl''''', often referred to simply as '''''Broken Blossoms''''', is a 1919 American [[silent film|silent]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[D.W. Griffith]]. It was distributed by [[United Artists]] and premiered on May 13, 1919. It stars [[Lillian Gish]], [[Richard Barthelmess]], and [[Donald Crisp]], and tells the story of young girl, Lucy Burrows, who is abused by her alcoholic prizefighting father, Battling Burrows, and meets Cheng Huan, a kind-hearted Chinese man who falls in love with her. It was the second film released by United Artists. It is based on [[Thomas Burke (author)|Thomas Burke]]'s short story "The Chink and the Child" from the 1916 collection ''[[Limehouse Nights]]''.

==Plot==
[[File:Broken Blossoms.webm|thumb|left|''Broken Blossoms'']] 
Cheng Huan ([[Richard Barthelmess]]) leaves his native [[China]] because he "dreams to spread the gentle message of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] to the Anglo-Saxon lands." His idealism fades as he is faced with the brutal reality of [[London]]'s gritty inner-city. However, his mission is finally realized in his devotion to the "broken blossom" Lucy Burrows ([[Lillian Gish]]), the beautiful but unwanted and abused daughter of boxer Battling Burrows ([[Donald Crisp]]).

After being beaten and discarded one evening by her raging father, Lucy finds sanctuary in Cheng's home, the beautiful and exotic room above his shop. As Cheng nurses Lucy back to health, the two form a bond as two unwanted outcasts of society. All goes astray for them when Lucy's father gets wind of his daughter's whereabouts and in a drunken rage drags her back to their home to punish her. Fearing for her life, Lucy locks herself inside a closet to escape her contemptuous father.

By the time Cheng arrives to rescue Lucy, whom he so innocently adores, it is too late. Lucy's lifeless body lies on her modest bed as Battling has a drink in the other room. As Cheng gazes at Lucy's youthful face which, in spite of the circumstances, beams with innocence and even the slightest hint of a smile, Battling enters the room to make his escape. The two stand for a long while, exchanging spiteful glances, until Battling lunges for Cheng with a hatchet, and Cheng retaliates by shooting Burrows repeatedly with his handgun. After returning to his home with Lucy's body, Cheng builds a shrine to Buddha and takes his own life with a knife to the chest.

* [[Donald Crisp]] as Battling Burrows
* Arthur Howard as Burrows' manager
* [[Edward Peil Sr.]] as Evil Eye

==Production and style==
[[File:Broken blossoms newspaper ad.png|thumb|right|220px|Newspaper ad for the film]]
Unlike Griffith's more extravagant earlier works like ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' or ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'', ''Broken Blossoms'' is a small-scale film that uses controlled studio environments to create a more intimate effect.

Griffith was known for his willingness to collaborate with his actors and on many occasions join them in research outings.&lt;ref name="Schickel, Richard 1984. page 391"&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''D.W. Griffith: an American Film Life.'' New York: Proscenium Publishers Inc, 1984. {{ISBN|0-87910-080-X}}, page 391&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Martin. ''Griffith: First Artist of the Movies.'' Oxford, Oxford University Press. 1980. {{ISBN|0-19-502685-3}}, 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual style of ''Broken Blossoms'' emphasises the seedy [[Limehouse]] streets with their dark shadows, drug addicts and drunkards, contrasting them with the beauty of Cheng and Lucy's innocent attachment as expressed by Cheng's decorative apartment. Conversely, the Burrows' bare cell reeks of oppression and hostility. Film critic and historian [[Richard Schickel]] goes so far as to credit this gritty realism with inspiring "the likes of [[G.W. Pabst|Pabst]], [[Mauritz Stiller|Stiller]], [[Josef von Sternberg|von Sternberg]], and others, [and then] re-emerging in the United States in the sound era, in the genre identified as [[Film Noir]]".&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''D.W. Griffith: an American Film Life.'' New York: Proscenium Publishers Inc, 1984. {{ISBN|0-87910-080-X}}, page 394&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffith was unsure of his final product and took several months to complete the editing, saying, "I can't look at the damn thing; it depresses me so."&lt;ref&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''D.W. Griffith: an American Film Life.'' New York: Proscenium Publishers Inc, 1984. {{ISBN|0-87910-080-X}}, page 395&lt;/ref&gt;

==Box office==
The film was originally made for Famous Players Lasky. The company sold it to the newly founded [[United Artists]] for $250,000. The film turned out to be a hit at the box office and earned a profit of $700,000.&lt;ref name="tino"/&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Broken blossoms lobby card LOC.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lobby card for the film, showing the early scene in which drunken Western sailors fight on a street in China]]
''Broken Blossoms'' premiered in May 1919, at the [[George M. Cohan|George M. Cohan Theatre]] in [[New York City]] as part of the D.W. Griffith Repertory Season.&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Iris. ''D.W. Griffith: American Film Master.'' New York: Museum of Modern Art Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-87070-683-7}}, page&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lillian Gish's autobiography, theaters were decorated with flowers, moon lanterns and beautiful Chinese brocaded draperies for the premiere. Critics and audiences were pleased with Griffith's follow-up film to his 1916 epic ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, Paul. ''Griffith and the Rise of Hollywood.'' Manchester: Castle Books, 1970. {{ISBN|0-498-07718-7}}, page 127&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting with ''Intolerance'''s grand story, set and length, Griffith charmed audiences by the delicacy with which ''Broken Blossoms'' handled such a complex subject.
{{Quote|Reviewers found it "Surprising in its simplicity"...the acting seemed [[wikt:nine day wonder|nine days' wonder]] – no one talked of anything but Lillian's smile, Lillian turned like a tormented animal in a trap, of Barthelmess' convincing restraint. Few pictures have enjoyed greater or more lasting [[wikt:succès d'estime|succès d'estime]]."&lt;ref&gt;Barry, Iris. ''D.W. Griffith: American Film Master.'' New York: Museum of Modern Art Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-87070-683-7}}, page 28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The scenes of [[child abuse]] nauseated backers when Griffith gave them a preview of the film; according to Lillian Gish in interviews, a ''Variety'' reporter invited to sit in on a second take left the room to vomit.&lt;ref&gt;Affron, Charles, ''Lillian Gish, Her Legend, Her Life'' (Scribner, 2002), p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
Today, ''Broken Blossoms'' is widely regarded as one of Griffith's finest works. In 2012, the film received five critics' votes and one director's vote in the [[British Film Institute]]'s decennial ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' poll. [[Roger Ebert]] was a longtime champion of the film, having added it to his "Great Movies" series; and in 1996, it was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

Review aggregation site ''They Shoot Pictures, Don't They'' has since found ''Broken Blossoms'' to be the 261st most acclaimed film in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyshootpictures.com/gf1000_all1000films_table.php |title=1,000 Greatest Films (Full List) |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Cruelty and injustice against the innocent are a recurring theme in Griffith's films and are graphically portrayed here. The introductory card says, "We may believe there are no Battling Burrows, striking the helpless with brutal whip — but do we not ourselves use the whip of unkind words and deeds? So, perhaps, Battling may even carry a message of warning."

''Broken Blossoms'' was released during a period of strong anti-Chinese feeling in the US, a fear known as the [[Yellow Peril]]. The phrase "yellow peril" was common in the U.S. [[newspapers]] owned by [[William Randolph Hearst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,746032,00.html | work=Time | title=Foreign News: Again, Yellow Peril | date=September 11, 1933 | accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also the title of a popular book by an influential U.S. religious figure, [[G. G. Rupert]], who published ''The Yellow Peril; or, Orient vs. Occident'' in 1911. Griffith changed Burke's original story to promote a message of tolerance. In Burke's story, the Chinese protagonist is a sordid young Shanghai drifter pressed into naval service, who frequents [[opium den]]s and whorehouses; in the film, he becomes a Buddhist missionary whose initial goal is to spread the word of Buddha and peace (although he is also shown frequenting opium dens when he is depressed). Even at his lowest point, he still prevents his gambling companions from fighting.

==The "closet scene"==
The most-discussed scene in ''Broken Blossoms'' is Lillian Gish's "closet" scene. Here Gish performs Lucy's horror by writhing in the [[claustrophobic]] space like a tortured animal who knows there is no escape.&lt;ref name="Schickel, Richard 1984. page 392"&gt;Schickel, Richard. ''D.W. Griffith: an American Film Life.'' New York: Proscenium Publishers Inc, 1984. {{ISBN|0-87910-080-X}}, page 392&lt;/ref&gt; There is more than one anecdote about the filming of the "closet" scene, [[Richard Schickel]] writes:
{{Quote|It is heartbreaking – yet for the most part quite delicately controlled by the actress. Barthelmess reports that her hysteria was induced by Griffith's taunting of her. Gish, on her part, claims that she improvised the child's tortured movements on the spot and that when she finished the scene there was a hush on stage, broken finally by Griffith's exclamation, "My God, why didn't you warn me you were going to do that?"&lt;ref name="Schickel, Richard 1984. page 392"/&gt;}}
The scene is also used to demonstrate Griffith's uncanny ability to create an aural effect with only an image.&lt;ref&gt;O'Dell, Paul. ''Griffith and the Rise of Hollywood.'' Manchester: Castle Books, 1970. {{ISBN|0-498-07718-7}}, page 125&lt;/ref&gt; Gish's screams apparently attracted such a crowd outside the studio that people needed to be held back.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Martin. ''Griffith: First Artist of the Movies.'' Oxford, Oxford University Press. 1980. {{ISBN|0-19-502685-3}}, page 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remake==
A UK remake, also titled ''[[Broken Blossoms (1936 film)|Broken Blossoms]]'', followed in 1936.

{{Byzantine culture}}
'''Byzantine art''' refers to the body of Christian Greek artistic products of the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman]] (Byzantine) Empire,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michelis|1946}}; {{harvnb|Weitzmann|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the nations and states that inherited culturally from the empire. Though the empire itself emerged from Rome's decline and lasted until the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitzinger|1977|pp=1‒3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the start date of the Byzantine period is rather clearer in art history than in political history, if still imprecise. Many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] states in Eastern Europe, as well as to some degree the [[Muslim world|Muslim]] states of the eastern [[Mediterranean]], preserved many aspects of the empire's culture and art for centuries afterward.

A number of states contemporary with the [[Byzantine Empire]] were culturally influenced by it, without actually being part of it (the "[[Byzantine commonwealth]]"). These included the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]], as well as some non-Orthodox states like the [[Republic of Venice]], which separated from the Byzantine empire in the 10th century, and the [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Kingdom of Sicily]], which had close ties to the Byzantine Empire and had also been a Byzantine possession until the 10th century with a large Greek-speaking population persisting into the 12th century. Other states having a Byzantine artistic tradition had oscillated throughout the Middle Ages between being part of the Byzantine empire and having periods of independence, such as [[History of Medieval Serbia|Serbia]] and [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]]. After the [[Fall of Constantinople|fall of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople]] in 1453, art produced by Eastern Orthodox Christians living in the [[Ottoman Empire]] was often called "post-Byzantine." Certain artistic traditions that originated in the Byzantine Empire, particularly in regard to icon painting and church architecture, are maintained in [[Greece]], [[Cyprus]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], [[Russia]] and other Eastern Orthodox countries to the present day.

==Introduction==
[[File:Encaustic Virgin.jpg|thumb|200px|Icon of the enthroned Virgin and Child with saints and angels, 6th century, [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], Sinai]]

Byzantine art originated and evolved from the Christianized Greek culture of the Eastern Roman Empire; content from both Christianity and classical Greek mythology were artistically expressed through Hellenistic modes of style and iconography.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michelis|1946}}; {{harvnb|Ainalov|1961|loc="Introduction", pp. 3‒8}}; {{harvnb|Stylianou|Stylianou|1985|p=19}}; {{harvnb|Hanfmann|1962|loc="Early Christian Sculpture", p. 42}}; {{harvnb|Weitzmann|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of Byzantium never lost sight of its classical heritage; the Byzantine capital, [[Constantinople]], was adorned with a large number of classical sculptures,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bassett|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; although they eventually became an object of some puzzlement for its inhabitants&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cyril|1965|pp=53‒75}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (however, Byzantine beholders showed no signs of puzzlement towards other forms of classical media such as wall paintings&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ainalov|1961|loc="The Hellenistic Character of Byzantine Wall Painting", pp. 185‒214}}.&lt;/ref&gt;). The basis of Byzantine art is a fundamental artistic attitude held by the Byzantine Greeks who, like their ancient Greek predecessors, "were never satisfied with a play of forms alone, but stimulated by an innate rationalism, endowed forms with life by associating them with a meaningful content."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weitzmann|1981|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the art produced in the Byzantine Empire was marked by periodic revivals of a classical aesthetic, it was above all marked by the development of a new aesthetic defined by its salient "abstract", or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach.

[[File:Byzantine - Saint Arethas - Walters 4820862.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian]] Saint Arethas depicted in traditional Byzantine style (10th century)]]

The nature and causes of this transformation, which largely took place during [[late antiquity]], have been a subject of scholarly debate for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brendel|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Vasari]] attributed it to a decline in artistic skills and standards, which had in turn been revived by his contemporaries in the [[Italian Renaissance]]. Although this point of view has been occasionally revived, most notably by [[Bernard Berenson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berenson|1954}}.&lt;/ref&gt; modern scholars tend to take a more positive view of the Byzantine aesthetic. [[Alois Riegl]] and [[Josef Strzygowski]], writing in the early 20th century, were above all responsible for the revaluation of late antique art.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Elsner|2002|pp=358‒379}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Riegl saw it as a natural development of pre-existing tendencies in Roman art, whereas Strzygowski viewed it as a product of "oriental" influences. Notable recent contributions to the debate include those of [[Ernst Kitzinger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitzinger|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who traced a "dialectic" between "abstract" and "Hellenistic" tendencies in late antiquity, and [[John Onians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Onians|1980|pp=1‒23}}.&lt;/ref&gt; who saw an "increase in visual response" in late antiquity, through which a viewer "could look at something which was in twentieth-century terms purely abstract and find it representational."

In any case, the debate is purely modern: it is clear that most Byzantine viewers did not consider their art to be abstract or unnaturalistic. As [[Cyril Mango]] has observed, "our own appreciation of Byzantine art stems largely from the fact that this art is not naturalistic; yet the Byzantines themselves, judging by their extant statements, regarded it as being highly naturalistic and as being directly in the tradition of [[Phidias]], [[Apelles]], and [[Zeuxis]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mango|1963|p=65}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meister von Nerezi 001.jpg|thumb|260px|Frescoes in Nerezi near [[Skopje]] (1164), with their unique blend of high tragedy, gentle humanity, and homespun realism, anticipate the approach of [[Giotto]] and other proto-Renaissance Italian artists.]]

The subject matter of monumental Byzantine art was primarily religious and imperial: the two themes are often combined, as in the portraits of later Byzantine emperors that decorated the interior of the sixth-century church of [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople. These preoccupations are partly a result of the pious and autocratic nature of Byzantine society, and partly a result of its economic structure: the wealth of the empire was concentrated in the hands of the church and the imperial office, which had the greatest opportunity to undertake monumental artistic commissions.

Religious art was not, however, limited to the monumental decoration of church interiors. One of the most important genres of Byzantine art was the [[icon]], an image of Christ, the Virgin, or a saint, used as an object of veneration in Orthodox churches and private homes alike. Icons were more religious than aesthetic in nature: especially after the end of iconoclasm, they were understood to manifest the unique "presence" of the figure depicted by means of a "likeness" to that figure maintained through carefully maintained canons of representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Belting|Jephcott|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The illumination of manuscripts was another major genre of Byzantine art. The most commonly illustrated texts were religious, both scripture itself (particularly the Psalms) and devotional or theological texts (such as the ''[[Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of [[John Climacus]] or the homilies of [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]). Secular texts were also illuminated: important examples include the [[Alexander Romance]] and the history of [[John Skylitzes]].

The Byzantines inherited the [[Early Christian art|Early Christian]] distrust of [[monumental sculpture]] in religious art, and produced only [[relief]]s, of which very few survivals are anything like life-size, in sharp contrast to the medieval art of the West, where monumental sculpture revived from [[Carolingian art]] onwards. Small ivories were also mostly in relief.

The so-called "minor arts" were very important in Byzantine art and luxury items, including ivories carved in relief as formal presentation [[Consular diptych]]s or caskets such as the [[Veroli casket]], [[hardstone carving]]s, [[Byzantine enamel|enamels]], [[Byzantine glass|glass]], jewelry, metalwork, and [[Byzantine silk|figured silks]] were produced in large quantities throughout the Byzantine era. Many of these were religious in nature, although a large number of objects with secular or non-representational decoration were produced: for example, ivories representing themes from classical mythology. Byzantine ceramics were relatively crude, as pottery was never used at the tables of the rich, who ate off [[Byzantine silver]].

==Periods==
[[File:Abside 00311.JPG|thumb|180px|Interior of the [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda#Rotunda of Galerius|Rotunda of St. George]], [[Thessaloniki]], with remnants of the mosaics]]

Byzantine art and architecture is divided into four periods by convention: the Early period, commencing with the [[Edict of Milan]] (when Christian worship was legitimized) and the transfer of the imperial seat to Constantinople, extends to AD 842, with the conclusion of [[Iconoclasm]]; the Middle, or high period, begins with the restoration of the icons in 843 and culminates in the Fall of Constantinople to the Crusaders in 1204; the Late period includes the eclectic osmosis between Western European and traditional Byzantine elements in art and architecture, and ends with the Fall of Constantinople to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. The term post-Byzantine is then used for later years, whereas "Neo-Byzantine" is used for art and architecture from the 19th century onwards, when the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire prompted a renewed appreciation of Byzantium by artists and historians alike.

=== Early Byzantine art ===
[[File:IvoireJeuxCirqueConstantinopleMuséeCluny.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Leaf from an ivory diptych of [[Areobindus Dagalaiphus Areobindus]], consul in Constantinople, 506. Areobindus is shown above, presiding over the games in the Hippodrome, depicted beneath ([[Musée national du Moyen Âge]])]]

Two events were of fundamental importance to the development of a unique, Byzantine art. First, the [[Edict of Milan]], issued by the emperors [[Constantine I]] and [[Licinius]] in 313, allowed for public Christian worship, and led to the development of a monumental, Christian art. Second, the dedication of [[Constantinople]] in 330 created a great new artistic centre for the eastern half of the Empire, and a specifically Christian one. Other artistic traditions flourished in rival cities such as [[Alexandria]], [[Antioch]], and [[Rome]], but it was not until all of these cities had fallen - the first two to the [[Arabs]] and Rome to the [[Goths]] - that Constantinople established its supremacy.

Constantine devoted great effort to the decoration of Constantinople, adorning its public spaces with ancient statuary,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bassett|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and building a [[Forum of Constantine|forum]] dominated by a porphyry column that carried a statue of himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fowden|1991|pp=119‒131}}; {{harvnb|Bauer|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Major Constantinopolitan churches built under Constantine and his son, [[Constantius II]], included the original foundations of [[Hagia Sophia]] and the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1971}}; {{harvnb|Henck|2001|pp=279‒304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major building campaign in Constantinople was sponsored by [[Theodosius I]]. The most important surviving monument of this period is the obelisk and base erected by Theodosius in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople|Hippodrome]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kiilerich|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which, with the large silver dish called the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]], represents the classic examples of what is sometimes called the "Theodosian Renaissance". The earliest surviving church in Constantinople is the Basilica of St. John at the [[Stoudios]] Monastery, built in the fifth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mathews|1971}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RabulaGospelsFol13vAscension.jpg|thumb|200px|Miniatures of the 6th-century [[Rabula Gospel]] (a Byzantine Syriac Gospel) display the more abstract and symbolic nature of Byzantine art.]]

Due to subsequent rebuilding and destruction, relatively few Constantinopolitan monuments of this early period survive. However, the development of monumental early Byzantine art can still be traced through surviving structures in other cities. For example, important early churches are found in Rome (including [[Santa Sabina]] and [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Santa Maria Maggiore]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Krautheimer|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Thessaloniki]] (the [[Arch and Tomb of Galerius|Rotunda]] and the [[Church of the Acheiropoietos|Acheiropoietos Basilica]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spieser|1984}}; {{harvnb|Ćurčić|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of important illuminated manuscripts, both sacred and secular, survive from this early period. Classical authors, including [[Virgil]] (represented by the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Vergilius Romanus]])&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Homer]] (represented by the [[Ambrosian Iliad]]), were illustrated with narrative paintings. Illuminated biblical manuscripts of this period survive only in fragments: for example, the [[Quedlinburg Itala fragment]] is a small portion of what must have been a lavishly illustrated copy of [[1 Kings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levin|1985}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Byzantine art was also marked by the cultivation of [[ivory carving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Volbach|1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory [[diptych]]s, often elaborately decorated, were issued as gifts by newly appointed [[consul]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Delbrueck|1929}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver plates were another important form of luxury art:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dodd|1961}}.&lt;/ref&gt; among the most lavish from this period is the [[Missorium of Theodosius I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Almagro-Gorbea|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarcophagi]] continued to be produced in great numbers.

===Age of Justinian I===
[[File:The mosaic of Emperor Justinian and his retinue.jpg|thumb|left|260px|Mosaic from San Vitale in [[Ravenna]], showing the Emperor [[Justinian]] and Bishop Maximian, surrounded by clerics and soldiers.]]
[[File:Byzantine ivory 801.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Archangel ivory]] of the early 6th century from Constantinople]]

Significant changes in Byzantine art coincided with the reign of [[Justinian I]] (527–565). Justinian devoted much of his reign to reconquering Italy, North Africa and Spain. He also laid the foundations of the imperial absolutism of the Byzantine state, codifying its laws and imposing his religious views on all his subjects by law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maas|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A significant component of Justinian's project of imperial renovation was a massive building program, which was described in a book, the ''Buildings'', written by Justinian's court historian, [[Procopius]].&lt;ref&gt;Tr. H.B. Dewing, ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Buildings/home.html  Procopius VII]'' (Cambridge, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian renovated, rebuilt, or founded anew countless churches within Constantinople, including [[Hagia Sophia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mainstone|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which had been destroyed during the [[Nika riots]], the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dark|Özgümüş|2002|pp=393‒413}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Little Hagia Sophia|Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bardill|2000|pp=1‒11}}; {{harvnb|Mathews|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Justinian also built a number of churches and fortifications outside of the imperial capital, including [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forsyth|Weitzmann|1973}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Basilica of St. John in [[Ephesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thiel|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several major churches of this period were built in the provinces by local bishops in imitation of the new Constantinopolitan foundations. The [[Basilica of San Vitale]] in [[Ravenna]], was built by Bishop [[Maximianus of Ravenna|Maximianus]]. The decoration of San Vitale includes important mosaics of Justinian and his empress, [[Theodora (6th century)|Theodora]], although neither ever visited the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Deichmann|1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Also of note is the [[Euphrasian Basilica]] in [[Poreč]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nickerson.icomos.org/euf/euf-idx.htm Eufrasiana Basilica Project.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Archeological discoveries in the 19th and 20th centuries unearthed a large group of [[Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East]]. The eastern provinces of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] and later the [[Byzantine Empire]]s inherited a strong artistic tradition from the [[Late Antiquity]]. Christian mosaic art flourished in this area from the 4th century onwards. The tradition of making mosaics was carried on in the [[Umayyad]] era until the end of the 8th century. The most important surviving examples are the [[Madaba Map]], the mosaics of [[Mount Nebo]], Saint Catherine's Monastery and the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now [[Umm ar-Rasas]]).

The first fully preserved illuminated biblical manuscripts date to the first half of the sixth century, most notably the [[Vienna Genesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wellesz|1960}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Rossano Gospels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cavallo|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Sinope Gospels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grabar|1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vienna Dioscurides]] is a lavishly illustrated botanical treatise, presented as a gift to the Byzantine aristocrat [[Julia Anicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mazal|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important ivory sculptures of this period include the [[Barberini ivory]], which probably depicts Justinian himself,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cutler|1993|pp=329‒339}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Archangel ivory]] in the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1986|pp=75‒79}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silver plate continued to be decorated with scenes drawn from classical mythology; for example, a [[:Image:Hercule et le Lion de Némée 01.JPG|plate]] preserved in the Cabinet des Médailles, Paris, depicts [[Hercules]] wrestling the [[Nemean lion]].

===Seventh-century crisis===
[[File:Meister der Demetrius-Kirche in Saloniki 002.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosaic from the church of [[Hagios Demetrios]] in [[Thessaloniki]], late 7th or early 8th century, showing [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki|St. Demetrios]] with the bishop and the eparch]]
The Age of Justinian was followed by a political decline, since most of Justinian's conquests were lost and the Empire faced acute crisis with the invasions of the [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Slavs]], Persians&lt;!-- Do not link to the disambiguation page, "Persians"; link to a specific iteration of this topic. --&gt; and [[Arabs]] in the 7th century. Constantinople was also wracked by religious and political conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most significant surviving monumental projects of this period were undertaken outside of the imperial capital. The church of [[Hagios Demetrios]] in Thessaloniki was rebuilt after a fire in the mid-seventh century. The new sections include mosaics executed in a remarkably abstract style.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brubaker|2004|pp=63‒90}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The church of the Koimesis in Nicaea (present-day [[Iznik]]), destroyed in the early 20th century but documented through photographs, demonstrates the simultaneous survival of a more classical style of church decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barber|1991|pp=43‒60}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The churches of Rome, still a Byzantine territory in this period, also include important surviving decorative programs, especially [[Santa Maria Antiqua]], [[Sant'Agnese fuori le mura]], and the Chapel of San Venanzio in [[San Giovanni in Laterano]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matthiae|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Byzantine mosaicists probably also contributed to the decoration of the early [[Umayyad]] monuments, including the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Creswell|1969}}; {{harvnb|Flood|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Important works of luxury art from this period include the silver [[David Plates]], produced during the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]], and depicting scenes from the life of the Hebrew king [[David]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leader|2000|pp=407‒427}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable surviving manuscripts are [[Syriac language|Syriac]] gospel books, such as the so-called [[Syriac Bible of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leroy|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[London Canon Tables]] bear witness to the continuing production of lavish gospel books in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nordenfalk|1938}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The period between Justinian and iconoclasm saw major changes in the social and religious roles of images within Byzantium. The veneration of [[acheiropoieta]], or holy images "not made by human hands," became a significant phenomenon, and in some instances these images were credited with saving cities from military assault. By the end of the seventh century, certain images of saints had come to be viewed as "windows" through which one could communicate with the figure depicted. [[Proskynesis]] before images is also attested in texts from the late seventh century. These developments mark the beginnings of a theology of [[icon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brubaker|1998|pp=1215‒1254}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the debate over the proper role of art in the decoration of churches intensified. [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/trullo.html Three canons] of the [[Quinisext Council]] of 692 addressed controversies in this area: prohibition of the representation of the cross on church pavements (Canon 73), prohibition of the representation of Christ as a lamb (Canon 82), and a general injunction against "pictures, whether they are in paintings or in what way so ever, which attract the eye and corrupt the mind, and incite it to the enkindling of base pleasures" (Canon 100).

===Crisis of iconoclasm===

Intense debate over the role of art in worship led eventually to the period of "[[Byzantine iconoclasm]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryer|Herrin|1977}}; {{harvnb|Brubaker|Haldon|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sporadic outbreaks of iconoclasm on the part of local bishops are attested in Asia Minor during the 720s. In 726, an underwater earthquake between the islands of Thera and Therasia was interpreted by Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] as a sign of God's anger, and may have led Leo to remove a famous icon of Christ from the [[Chalke Gate]] outside the imperial palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stein|1980}}; The story of the Chalke Icon may be a later invention: {{harvnb|Auzépy|1990|pp=445‒492}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, iconoclasm probably did not become imperial policy until the reign of Leo's son, [[Constantine V]]. The [[Council of Hieria]], convened under Constantine in 754, proscribed the manufacture of icons of Christ. This inaugurated the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic period]], which lasted, with interruptions, until 843.

While iconoclasm severely restricted the role of religious art, and led to the removal of some earlier apse mosaics and (possibly) the sporadic destruction of portable icons, it never constituted a total ban on the production of figural art. Ample literary sources indicate that secular art (i.e. hunting scenes and depictions of the games in the hippodrome) continued to be produced,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grabar|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and the few monuments that can be securely dated to the period (most notably the manuscript of Ptolemy's "Handy Tables" today held by the Vatican&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1985|pp=355‒362}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) demonstrate that metropolitan artists maintained a high quality of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bryer|Herrin|1977|loc=Robin Cormack, "The Arts during the Age of Iconoclasm"}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Major churches dating to this period include [[Hagia Irene|Hagia Eirene]] in Constantinople, which was rebuilt in the 760s following its destruction by an earthquake in 740. The interior of Hagia Eirene, which is dominated by a large mosaic cross in the apse, is one of the best-preserved examples of iconoclastic church decoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peschlow|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The church of Hagia Sophia in Thessaloniki was also rebuilt in the late 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Theocharidou|1988}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain churches built outside of the empire during this period, but decorated in a figural, "Byzantine," style, may also bear witness to the continuing activities of Byzantine artists. Particularly important in this regard are the original mosaics of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]] (since either destroyed or heavily restored) and the frescoes in the Church of Maria foris portas in [[Castelseprio]].

The rulings of the Council of Hieria were reversed by a new church council in 843, celebrated to this day in the Eastern Orthodox Church as the "Triumph of Orthodoxy." In 867, the installation of a new apse mosaic in Hagia Sophia depicting the Virgin and Child was celebrated by the Patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photios]] in a famous homily as a victory over the evils of iconoclasm. Later in the same year, the Emperor [[Basil I]], called "the Macedonian," acceded to the throne; as a result the following period of Byzantine art has sometimes been called the "[[Macedonian Renaissance]]", although the term is doubly problematic (it was neither "[[Macedonia (terminology)|Macedonian]]", nor, strictly speaking, a "[[Renaissance]]").

In the 9th and 10th centuries, the Empire's military situation improved, and patronage of art and architecture increased. New churches were commissioned, and the standard architectural form (the "[[cross-in-square]]") and decorative scheme of the Middle Byzantine church were standardised. Major surviving examples include [[Hosios Loukas]] in [[Boeotia]], the [[Daphni Monastery]] near [[Athens]] and [[Nea Moni]] on [[Chios]].

There was a revival of interest in the depiction of subjects from classical mythology (as on the Veroli Casket) and in the use of a "classical" style to depict religious, and particularly Old Testament, subjects (of which the [[Paris Psalter]] and the [[Joshua Roll]] are important examples).

The Macedonian period also saw a revival of the late antique technique of [[ivory]] carving. Many ornate ivory [[triptych]]s and [[diptych]]s survive, such as the [[Harbaville Triptych]] and a triptych at [[Luton Hoo]], dating from the reign of [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nicephorus Phocas]].

===Komnenian age===
[[File:Anastasi Dafnis.jpg|thumb|200px|Mosaic of [[Daphni Monastery]] (ca. 1100)]]

The Macedonian emperors were followed by the [[Comnenus|Komnenian dynasty]], beginning with the reign of [[Alexios I Komnenos]] in 1081. Byzantium had recently suffered a period of severe dislocation following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071 and the subsequent loss of Asia Minor to the Turks. However, the Komnenoi brought stability to the empire (1081–1185) and during the course of the twelfth century their energetic campaigning did much to restore the fortunes of the empire. The Komnenoi were great patrons of the arts, and with their support Byzantine artists continued to move in the direction of greater humanism and emotion, of which the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]], the cycle of mosaics at [[Daphni Monastery|Daphni]], and the murals at [[Church of St. Panteleimon (Nerezi)|Nerezi]] yield important examples. Ivory sculpture and other expensive mediums of art gradually gave way to frescoes and icons, which for the first time gained widespread popularity across the Empire. Apart from painted icons, there were other varieties - notably the mosaic and [[ceramic]] ones.

Some of the finest Byzantine work of this period may be found outside the Empire: in the mosaics of [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati]], [[Kiev]], [[Torcello]], [[Venice]], [[Monreale]], [[Cefalù]] and [[Palermo]]. For instance, Venice's [[San Marco di Venezia|Basilica of St Mark]], begun in 1063, was based on the great [[Church of the Holy Apostles]] in Constantinople, now destroyed, and is thus an echo of the age of Justinian. The acquisitive habits of the Venetians mean that the basilica is also a great museum of Byzantine artworks of all kinds (e.g., [[Pala d'Oro]]).

Centuries of continuous Roman political tradition and Hellenistic civilization underwent a crisis in 1204 with the sacking of Constantinople by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] and [[Kingdom of France|French]] knights of the [[Fourth Crusade]], a disaster from which the Empire recovered in 1261 albeit in a severely weakened state. Steven Runciman, a noted 20th-century historian of the Crusades, would write in 1954: "There was never a greater crime against humanity than the Fourth Crusade."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Runciman|1987|p=130}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The destruction by sack or subsequent neglect of the city's secular architecture in particular has left us with an imperfect understanding of Byzantine art.

Although the Byzantines regained the city in 1261, the Empire was thereafter a small and weak state confined to the Greek peninsula and the islands of the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]].  During their half-century of exile, however, the last great flowing of Anatolian Hellenism began. As [[Nicaea]] emerged as the center of opposition under the [[Laskaris]] emperors, it spawned a renaissance, attracting scholars, poets, and artists from across the Byzantine world.  A glittering court emerged as the dispossessed intelligentsia found in the Hellenic side of their traditions a pride and identity unsullied by association with the hated "latin" enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ash|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; With the recapture of the capital under the new [[Palaeologus|Palaeologan Dynasty]], Byzantine artists developed a new interest in landscapes and pastoral scenes, and the traditional mosaic-work (of which the [[Chora Church]] in [[Constantinople]] is the finest extant example) gradually gave way to detailed cycles of narrative frescoes (as evidenced in a large group of [[Mystras]] churches). The icons, which became a favoured medium for artistic expression, were characterized by a less austere attitude, new appreciation for purely decorative qualities of painting and meticulous attention to details, earning the popular name of the Paleologan Mannerism for the period in general.

[[Republic of Venice|Venice]] came to control [[Byzantine Crete]] by 1212, and Byzantine artistic traditions continued long after the Ottoman conquest of the [[Empire of Trebizond|last Byzantine successor state]] in 1461. The [[Cretan school]], as it is today known, gradually introduced Western elements into its style, and exported large numbers of icons to the West. The tradition's most famous artist was [[El Greco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Robert |last=Byron |author-link=Robert Byron |title=Greco: The Epilogue to Byzantine Culture |pages=160–174 |magazine=[[The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs]] |volume=55 |issue=319 |date=October 1929 |jstor=864104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Angelo G. |last=Procopiou |title=El Greco and Cretan Painting |page=74 |magazine=[[The Burlington Magazine]] |volume=94 |issue=588 |date=March 1952 |jstor=870678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Veneza118.jpg|thumb|[[St Mark's Basilica]] in [[Venice]], where imported Byzantine mosaicists were succeeded by Italians they had trained]]
[[File:Mural - Birth of Christ.jpg|thumb|Modern Orthodox mural from [[Israel]] using a depiction of the [[Nativity of Jesus in art|Nativity of Christ]] little changed in over a millennium]]

The splendour of Byzantine art was always in the mind of early medieval Western artists and patrons, and many of the most important movements in the period were conscious attempts to produce art fit to stand next to both classical Roman and contemporary Byzantine art. This was especially the case for the imperial [[Carolingian art]] and [[Ottonian art]].  Luxury products from the Empire were highly valued, and reached for example the royal [[Anglo-Saxon]] [[Sutton Hoo burial]] in [[Suffolk]] of the 620s, which contains several pieces of silver. [[Byzantine silk]]s were especially valued and large quantities were distributed as diplomatic gifts from Constantinople.  There are records of Byzantine artists working in the West, especially during the period of iconoclasm, and some works, like the frescos at [[Castelseprio]] and miniatures in the [[Vienna Coronation Gospels]], seem to have been produced by such figures.

In particular, teams of [[mosaic]] artists were dispatched as diplomatic gestures by emperors to Italy, [[Late Antique and medieval mosaics in Italy|where they often trained locals]] to continue their work in a style heavily influenced by Byzantium. [[Venice]] and [[Norman-Arab-Byzantine culture|Norman Sicily]] were particular centres of Byzantine influence. The earliest surviving panel paintings in the West were in a style heavily influenced by contemporary Byzantine icons, until a distinctive Western style began to develop in Italy in the [[Trecento]]; the traditional and still influential narrative of [[Vasari]] and others has the story of Western painting begin as a breakaway by [[Cimabue]] and then [[Giotto]] from the shackles of the Byzantine tradition.  In general, Byzantine artistic influence on Europe was in steep decline by the 14th century if not earlier, despite the continued importance of migrated [[Byzantine scholars in the Renaissance]] in other areas.

[[Islamic art]] began with artists and craftsmen mostly trained in Byzantine styles, and though figurative content was greatly reduced, Byzantine decorative styles remained a great influence on Islamic art, and Byzantine artists continued to be imported for important works for some time, especially for [[mosaic]]s.

The Byzantine era properly defined came to an end with the [[fall of Constantinople]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1453, but by this time the Byzantine cultural heritage had been widely diffused, carried by the spread of Orthodox Christianity, to [[Bulgaria]], [[Serbia]], [[Romania]] and, most importantly, to [[Russia]], which became the centre of the Orthodox world following the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. Even under Ottoman rule, Byzantine traditions in icon-painting and other small-scale arts survived, especially in the Venetian-ruled Crete and [[Rhodes]], where a "post-Byzantine" style under increasing Western influence survived for a further two centuries, producing artists including [[El Greco]] whose training was in the [[Cretan School]] which was the most vigorous post-Byzantine school, exporting great numbers of icons to Europe. The willingness of the Cretan School to accept Western influence was atypical; in most of the post-Byzantine world "as an instrument of ethnic cohesiveness, art became assertively conservative during the ''Turcocratia''" (period of Ottoman rule).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kessler|1988|p=166}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian icon]] painting began by entirely adopting and imitating Byzantine art, as did the art of other Orthodox nations, and has remained extremely conservative in iconography, although its painting style has developed distinct characteristics, including influences from post-Renaissance Western art.  All the Eastern Orthodox churches have retained highly protective of their traditions in terms of the form and content of images and, for example, modern Orthodox [[Nativity of Jesus in art|depictions of the Nativity of Christ]] vary little in content from those developed in the 6th century.

[[File:Pompe funebre for Katarzyna Opalińska.jpg|thumb|''Castrum doloris'' of Queen [[Katarzyna Opalińska]]]]
'''Castrum doloris''' ([[Latin]] for ''castle of grief'') is a name for the structure and decorations sheltering or accompanying the [[catafalque]] or [[bier]] that signify the prestige or high estate of the deceased. A ''castrum doloris'' might feature an elaborate [[baldachin]] and would include [[candle]]s, possibly [[flower]]s, and in most cases [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], [[epitaph]]s and possibly [[allegorical]] [[statue]]s. Many extensive ''castra doloris'' can be traced to the customs of 17th century and 18th century or even earlier, since Pope Sixtus V's funeral arrangements included a ''castrum doloris'' in the late 16th Century.

Notable examples include [[coffin portrait]] ({{lang-pl|portret trumienny}}) of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

'''Digital painting''' is an emerging art form in which traditional painting techniques such as [[watercolor]], [[Oil paint|oils]], [[impasto]], etc. are applied using digital tools by means of a [[computer]], a [[digitizing tablet]] and [[Stylus (computing)|stylus]], and [[software]]. Traditional painting is painting with a physical medium as opposed to a more modern style like digital. Digital painting differs from other forms of [[digital art]], particularly [[computer-generated art]], in that it does not involve the computer rendering from a model.  The artist uses painting techniques to create the digital painting directly on the computer. All digital painting programs try to mimic the use of physical media through various brushes and paint effects.  Included in many programs are brushes that are digitally styled to represent the traditional style like oils, acrylics, pastels, charcoal, pen and even media such as airbrushing.  There are also certain effects unique to each type of digital paint which portray the realistic effects of say watercolor on a digital 'watercolor' painting.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corel.com/servlet/ContentServer/us/en/Product/1166553941991&lt;/ref&gt; In most digital painting programs, the users can create their own brush style using a combination of texture and shape.  This ability is very important in bridging the gap between traditional and digital painting.

Digital painting thrives mostly in production art. It is most widely used in conceptual design for film, television and video games. Digital painting software such as [[Corel Painter]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[ArtRage]], [[GIMP]], [[Krita]] and [[openCanvas]] give artists a similar environment to a physical painter: a canvas, painting tools, mixing palettes, and a multitude of color options.
There are various types of digital painting, including [[impressionism]], realism, and watercolor. There are both benefits and drawbacks of digital painting.  While digital painting allows the artist the ease of working in an organized, mess-free environment, some argue there will always be more control for an artist holding a physical brush in their hand. Some artists believe there is something missing from digital painting, such as the character that is unique to every physically made object.  Many artists post blogs and comment on the various differences between digitally created work and traditionally created artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vindicated13.wordpress.com/2007/11/13/art-traditional-vs-digital/ Art: Traditional vs. Digital « Vindicated&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.deviantart.com/galleries/digital/1061392/ deviantART Forum: Traditional painting vs Digital painting&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with traditional painting==

The main difference between digital and traditional painting is the non-linear process. That is, an artist can often arrange his painting in layers that can be edited independently. Also, the ability to undo and redo strokes frees the artist from a linear process. But digital painting is limited in how it employs the techniques and study of a traditional painter because of the surface differences and lack of physicality. The [[digital artist]] has at his disposal several tools not available to the traditional painter.  Some of these include: a virtual palette consisting of millions of colors, almost any size canvas or media, and the ability to take back mistakes, as well as erasers, pencils, spray cans, brushes, combs, and a variety of 2D and 3D effect tools.  A [[graphics tablet]] allows the artist to work with precise hand movements simulating a real pen and drawing surface. Even the traditional surface has changed for digital painting. Instead of a canvas or sketchbook, artists would use a mouse or tablet to display strokes that would appear with the touch of a pen to the tablet’s surface, or a click of pen.  Tablets can be pressure sensitive, allowing the artist to vary the intensity of the chosen media on the screen.  There are tablets with over two thousand different levels of pressure sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wacom.com/intuos/12x19.cfm Intuos3 12x19 - Product Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
===Sketchpad===
[[Image:Wacom Pen-tablet.jpg|thumb|Many artists prefer using graphics tablets to create digital paintings instead of using a mouse.]]
The earliest graphical manipulation program was called [[Sketchpad]].  Created in 1963 by [[Ivan Sutherland]], a grad student at [[MIT]], Sketchpad allowed the user to manipulate objects on a CRT ([[cathode ray tube]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui/4 The Real History of the GUI [Design Principles&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Sketchpad eventually led to the creation of the Rand Tablet for work on the GRAIL project in 1968, and the very first tablet was created.  Other early tablets, or digitizers, like the ID (intelligent digitizer) and the BitPad were commercially successful and used in CAD (Computer Aided Design) programs. Modern day tablets are the tools of choice by digital painters.  WACOM is the industry leader in tablets which can range in size from 4” x 6” all the way to 12” x 19” and are less than an inch thick. Other brands of graphic tablets are Aiptek, Monoprice, Hanvon, Genius, Adesso, Trust, Manhattan, Vistablet, DigiPro, etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://0.tqn.com/d/performingarts/1/0/9/7/-/-/GraphicsTabletComparisonChart.jpg Comparison chart of graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://painting.about.com/lr/graphics_tablet/1917/1/ Links to many graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://graphicssoft.about.com/od/aboutgraphics/a/graphicstablets.htm Sue Chastain, editor about graphic tablets.&lt;/ref&gt;
All these graphic tablets have the basic functions of a mouse, so they can be used as a mouse, not only in graphic editors but also as a replacement for a mouse, and they are compatible with practically all Windows and Macintosh software.

===Tablets===
The idea of using a [[graphics tablet|tablet]] to communicate directions to a computer has been an idea since 1968 when the RAND (Research and Development) company out of Santa Monica, developed the [[RAND tablet]] that was used to program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siarchives.si.edu/research/videohistory_catalog9536.html Smithsonian Institution Archives&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 
Digitizers were popularized in the mid 1970s and early 1980s by the commercial success of the ID (Intelligent Digitizer) and BitPad manufactured by the Summagraphics Corp. These digitizers were used as the input device for many high-end [[CAD]] ([[Computer Aided Design]]) systems as well as bundled with [[Personal computer|PC]]'s and PC based CAD software like [[AutoCAD]].

===MacPaint===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:MacpaintWP.png|thumb|MacPaint 1.0]] --&gt;
The first commercial program that allowed users to design, draw, and manipulate objects was the program [[MacPaint]]. This program’s first version was introduced on January 22, 1984 on the [[Apple Lisa]].  The ability to freehand draw and create graphics with this program made it the top program of its kind during 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/31/science/personal-computers-software-for-the-macintosh-plenty-on-the-way.html?sec=technology&amp;pagewanted=2 Personal Computers; Software For The Macintosh: Plenty On The Way - New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   The earlier versions of the program were called MacSketch and LisaSketch, and the last version of MacPaint was MacPaint 2.0 released in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4BlmsN4q2I&amp;feature=related YouTube - Apple Lisa&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of MacPaint's universal success was attributed to the release of the first Macintosh computer which was equipped with one other program called [[MacWrite]].  It was the first personal computer with a graphical user interface and lost much of the bulky size of its predecessor, the Lisa.  The Macintosh was available at about $2500 and the combination of a smaller design made the computer a hit, exposing the average computer user to the graphical possibilities of the included MacPaint.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sitepoint.com/article/real-history-gui/5- The Real History of the GUI [Design Principles&amp;#93;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adobe===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended.png|thumb|Adobe Photoshop CS3]] --&gt;
Another early image manipulation program was [[Adobe Photoshop]]. It was first called Display and was created in 1987 by [[Thomas Knoll]] at the [[University of Michigan]] as monochrome picture display program.  With help from his brother John, the program was turned into an image editing program called Imagepro, but later changed to Photoshop.  The Knolls agreed on a deal with [[Adobe systems]] and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and Photoshop 1.0 was released in 1991 for Macintosh. [[Adobe systems]] had previously release Adobe Illustrator 1.0 in 1986 on the Apple Macintosh. These two programs, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator are currently two of the top programs used in the productions of digital paintings.  Illustrator introduced the uses of [[Bezier curves]] which allowed the user to be incredibly detailed in their [[vector graphics|vector drawings]].

===Kid Pix===
In 1988, Craig Hickman created a paint program called [[Kid Pix]], which made it easier for children to use MacPaint. The program was originally created in black in white, and after several revisions was released in color in 1991.  Kid Pix was one of the first commercial programs to integrate color and sound in a creative format. While the Kid Pix was intentionally created for children, it became a useful tool for introducing adults to the computer as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pixelpoppin.com/kidpix/ Kid Pix: The Early Years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Web-based painting programs===
In recent years there has been a growth in the websites which support  painting digitally online. 
The user is still drawing digitally with the use of software: often the software is on the server of the website which is being used. However, with the emergence of html5, some programs now partly use the client's web browser to handle some of the processing. The range of tools and brushes can be more limited than free standing software. Speed of response, quality of colour and the ability to save to a file or print are similar in either media.

[[File:Apocalyptic Scene - illuminated manuscript.jpg|thumb|right|240px|''Apocalyptic Scene'', [[Saint Louis Art Museum]]]]

Illustrated [[Apocalypse]] manuscripts are [[manuscript]]s that contain the text of [[Revelation]] or a commentary on Revelation and also illustrations. Many of the more famous Apocalypse manuscripts were made in [[England]] c. 1250-1400.    

[[Paul Meyer (philologist)|Paul Meyer]] and [[Léopold Delisle]], in their book ''L'Apocalypse en français au XIIIe siècle (Paris MS fr. 403)'', 2 vols., Paris, 1900-01, were the first scholars to try to list, describe and categorise the English Apocalypse manuscripts.  

[[Montague Rhodes James|M. R. James]] also wrote about illustrated Apocalypse manuscripts in his book ''The Apocalypse in Art'', London, 1931.

Since M. R. James' work, there have been a number of more recent studies by R. Freyhan, George Henderson, Peter Klein, Suzanne Lewis, Nigel Morgan and Lucy Sandler.

These manuscripts can be divided by the language and form of the Apocalypse text. Many manuscripts have a [[Latin]] text, others have an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] prose text and others have a [[French language|French]] verse text combined with a Latin text. Two manuscripts do not have a separate text, but incorporate excerpts from the text into the illustrations.

The illustrations can be divided into several different [[iconography|iconographic]] groups. The manuscripts with a Latin text all belong to the same iconographic family. With a few exceptions, this is also true of the manuscripts with the French prose texts and also with the French verse-Latin texts. The Eton Apocalypse features a Jewish Antichrist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Higgs Strickland |first=Debra |year=2003 |title=Saracens, Demons, &amp; Jews: Making Monsters in Medieval Art |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=pkcnIXxClUUC&amp;pg=PA213 213]}}&lt;/ref&gt; part of a larger anti-Jewish theme present throughout the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Henry |first=Avril |year=1990 |title=The Eton Roundels: Eton College MS 177 |publisher=Scholar Press |pages=42–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Extinction''''' is a 2018 American [[Science fiction|science fiction]] [[thriller film]] directed by Ben Young and written by Spenser Cohen, [[Eric Heisserer]] and [[Brad Kane]]. The film is about a father who has a recurring dream about the loss of his family while witnessing a force bent on destruction. The film stars [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Michael Peña]], [[Mike Colter]], Lilly Aspell, [[Emma Booth (actress)|Emma Booth]], [[Israel Broussard]], and [[Lex Shrapnel]]. It was released on [[Netflix]] on July 27, 2018.

== Plot ==
Peter, an engineer, has recurring nightmares in which he and everyone he knows suffer through violent, [[alien invasion]]-like confrontations with an unknown enemy. He reluctantly visits a clinic to receive psychiatric help, only to find a patient there who reveals that he is having the same visions, prompting Peter to believe his visions are of an upcoming invasion. 

That night, invading spaceships open fire on the city, causing significant damage. Peter and his wife Alice barricade their apartment amid the sounds of slaughter from ground troops. A soldier dressed in insectoid-looking armor breaks through anyway and finds Lucy, one of their two daughters, hiding underneath a table. The soldier pauses to examine her long enough to allow Peter and Alice to attack. Peter and his family then escape with the soldier's rifle. 

Based on his visions, Peter and his family agree that the factory he works at is a safe spot. He is able to bypass the rifle's [[biometric authentication]] and kill soldiers guarding the apartment building's exit. They make their way to a tunnel entrance to safely travel to the factory, but not before Alice is injured from a bomb blast. As they regroup, the soldier from their apartment appears, having tracked them with a homing signal on the rifle they took. To Peter's shock, the soldier removes his helmet and appears human. Peter forces the soldier to carry Alice to the factory. There, his boss, David, explains that the invasion has been expected for many years. A medic examines Alice but informs Peter that he cannot save her. As David's men drag the invading soldier off to execute him, he yells to Peter that he can save Alice. Peter agrees to stay with the soldier to save Alice; David will evacuate their children to a subway station where a transport train awaits to take them all to an offsite base.

The soldier surprises Peter by revealing that Alice is an [[Android (robot)|android]]. To save Alice, she needs an alternate source of power: Peter himself. At the soldier's guidance, Peter cuts open his own chest with a pocket knife, confirming that he is also an android. The soldier connects a cable between the two androids and Peter passes out, experiencing in detail what he had thought were visions of the future but are actually memories of a past war. Fearing that android workers ("synths") might rise up against humans, protesters attack unarmed synths. The synths fight back and eventually drive all humans off the whole planet. In order to deal with the guilt of what they have done and prevent themselves from living in fear of a reprisal from humans, the synths have wiped their memories out and lived normal lives.

Peter wakes up and the soldier, Miles, explains that humans have been living on [[Mars]] for 50 years. He had expected the synths to be monsters, not families with children. Peter and Alice part amicably with Miles to find their daughters as humans breach the roof of the factory. As they all depart on the train, David explains that he and a handful of other synths kept their memories to stay prepared for the inevitable return of the humans. Peter suggests that some day there could be peace between humans and synths.

On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 20 reviews, and an average rating of 4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Extinction'' has a few intriguing ideas, but they -- and some game performances from its talented stars -- are lost in the movie's muddled plot and frustrating pacing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/extinction_2018/|title=Extinction (2018)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=August 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 37 out of 100, based on 5 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/extinction-2018|title=Extinction (2018)|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=August 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Jake Nevins of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave it 2/5 stars and called the film "a competent, if formulaic film", writing that, by virtue of not being viewed theatrically, the film's flaws are magnified and its strengths were weakened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/jul/27/extinction-review-splashy-alien-invasion-thriller-crash-lands-on-netflix|title=Extinction review – splashy alien invasion thriller crash lands on Netflix|last=Nevins|first=Jake|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 27, 2018|accessdate=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1.5/4 star review for ''[[RogerEbert.com]]'', Nick Allen wrote "There's a tightness that I respect with ''Extinction.'' It's not so much a thrill-ride but a movie monorail, with one revelation at the end meant to reconsider the entire journey. That speaks to its efficiency as the latest in mindless, if not attention-less Netflix movies. ''Extinction'' doesn't seek to be much, but it's just not all that charming, either."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/extinction-2018|title=Extinction Review|last=Allen|first=Nick|website=[[RogerEbert.com]] |publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|date=July 27, 2018|access-date=July 29, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Léon Benouville first studied with his elder brother, [[Jean-Achille Benouville]] (1815–1891), in the studio of [[François-Edouard Picot]] before he transferred to [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in 1837.  Like his brother he received the [[Prix de Rome]] in 1845.

Both he and his brother travelled to Rome. In Rome, as a Prix de Rome pensionary at the [[Villa Medici]]. He remained there for a year, but his brother stayed on for two more years. His works produced in Rome are influenced by early Christianity and often show representations of antiquity.

==Work and style==
[[Image:Leon Benouville The Wrath of Achilles.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Wrath of [[Achilles]]'', by François-Léon Benouville ([[Musée Fabre]])]]
Benouville was best known for his portraits, mythological and religious compositions in the Neoclassical and Orientalist style. He worked in oils, ink and chalk.

==Awards, prizes and honours==

The '''Guild of Saint Luke''' was the most common name for a city [[guild]] for painters and other artists in [[early modern Europe]], especially in the [[Low Countries]]. They were named in honor of the [[Four Evangelists|Evangelist]] [[Saint Luke|Luke]], the [[patron saint]] of artists, who was identified by [[John of Damascus]] as having painted the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin's]] portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Howe.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most famous such organizations was founded in [[Antwerp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ford-Wille.&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to function until 1795, although by then it had lost its [[Legal monopoly|monopoly]] and therefore most of its power. In most cities, including Antwerp, the local government had given the Guild the power to regulate defined types of trade within the city.  Guild membership, as a master, was therefore required for an artist to take on apprentices or to sell paintings to the public. Similar rules existed in [[Delft]], where only members could sell paintings in the city or have a shop.&lt;ref&gt;Montias (1977): 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The early guilds in Antwerp and [[Bruges]], setting a model that would be followed in other cities, even had their own showroom or market stall from which members could sell their paintings directly to the public.&lt;ref name="prak248"&gt;Prak (2003): 248.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The guild of Saint Luke not only represented painters, sculptors, and other visual artists, but also—especially in the seventeenth century—dealers, amateurs, and even art lovers (the so-called ''liefhebbers'').&lt;ref name="prak249"&gt;Prak (2004): 249.&lt;/ref&gt; In the medieval period most members in most places were probably [[illuminated manuscript|manuscript illuminators]], where these were in the same guild as painters on wood and cloth—in many cities they were joined with the scribes or "scriveners". In traditional guild structures, house-painters and decorators were often in the same guild. However, as artists formed under their own specific guild of St. Luke, particularly in the Netherlands, distinctions were increasingly made.&lt;ref name="smith432"&gt;Smith (1999): 432.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, guilds also made judgments on disputes between artists and other artists or their clients.&lt;ref name="prak249" /&gt; In such ways, it controlled the economic career of an artist working in a specific city, while in different cities they were wholly independent and often competitive against each other. 

==Antwerp ==
Although it did not become a major artistic center until the sixteenth century, Antwerp was one of, if not the first, city to found a guild of Saint Luke. It is first mentioned in 1382, and was given special privileges by the city in 1442.&lt;ref name="baudouin"&gt;Baudouin (1973): 23–27.&lt;/ref&gt; The registers, or ''[[Liggeren]]'', from the guild exist, cataloging when artists became masters, who the dean for each year was, what their specialities were, and the names of any students.&lt;ref name="baudouin" /&gt;  In Bruges, however, which was the dominant city for artistic production in the Low Countries in the fifteenth century, the earliest known list of guild members dates to 1453, although the guild was certainly older than this.  There all artists had to belong to the guild in order to practice in their own names or to sell their works, and the guild was very strict about which artistic activities could be practiced–distinctly forbidding an artisan to work in an area where another guild's members, such as tapestry weaving, were represented.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell (1976): 191.&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Bruges==
The Bruges guild, in a typically idiosyncratic medieval arrangement, also included the saddlemakers, probably because most members were painting [[illuminated manuscript]]s on [[vellum]], and were therefore grouped as a sort of leatherworker. Perhaps because of this link, for a period they had a rule that all miniatures needed a tiny mark to identify the artist, which was registered with the Guild.&lt;ref&gt;Farquhar (1980): 371–383.&lt;/ref&gt;   Only under special privileges, such as court artist, could an artist effectively practice their craft without holding membership in the guild.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; [[Peter Paul Rubens]] had a similar situation in the seventeenth century, when he obtained special permission from the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Infanta Isabella Clara Eugenia of Spain|Isabella]] to be both court artist in [[Brussels]] and an active member of the Guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp.&lt;ref&gt;Belkin (1998): 96.&lt;/ref&gt; Membership also allowed members to sell works at the guild-owned showroom. Antwerp, for example, opened a market stall for selling paintings in front of the  [[Cathedral of Our Lady, Antwerp|cathedral]] in 1460, and Bruges followed in 1482.&lt;ref name="prak248" /&gt;

==Dutch Republic==
[[File:Jan de Bray 002.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The Governors of the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]] in 1675. [[Jan de Bray]] painted himself second from the left. Surprisingly, fewer such group portraits exist for painters than other Guild occupations.]] 
Guilds of St. Luke in the [[Dutch Republic]] began to reinvent themselves as cities there changed over to Protestant rule, and there were dramatic movements in population.  Many St. Luke guilds reissued charters to protect the interests of local painters from the influx of southern talent from places like Antwerp and Bruges. Many cities in the young republic became more important artistic centres in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. [[Amsterdam]] was the first city to reissue a St. Luke's charter after the reformation in 1579, and it included painters, sculptors, engravers, and other trades dealing specifically in the visual arts.&lt;ref name="prak241"&gt;Prak (2003): 241.&lt;/ref&gt; When trade between the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] resumed with the [[Twelve Years' Truce]] in 1609, immigration increased and many Dutch cities reissued guild charters as a form of protection against the great number of paintings that began to cross the border.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt;

For example, [[Gouda, South Holland|Gouda]], [[Rotterdam]], and [[Delft]], all founded guilds between 1609 and 1611.&lt;ref name="prak241" /&gt; In each of those cases, panel painters removed themselves from their traditional guild structure that included other painters, such as those who worked in fresco and on houses, in favor of a specific "Guild of St. Luke".&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; On the other hand, these distinctions did not take effect at that time in Amsterdam or Haarlem.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt; In the [[Haarlem Guild of St. Luke]], however, a strict hierarchy was attempted in 1631 with panel painters at the top, though this hierarchy was eventually rejected.&lt;ref name="smith432" /&gt;  In the [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] guild, also founded in 1611, the break was with the saddlemakers, but in 1644 a further split created a new painters' guild, leaving the guild of Saint Luke with only the sculptors and woodcarvers. A similar move in [[The Hague]] in 1656 led to the painters leaving the Guild of Saint Luke to establish a new ''[[Confrerie Pictura]]'' with all other kinds of visual artists, leaving the guild to the house-painters.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.66 &amp; 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists in other cities were not successful in setting up their own guilds of St. Luke, and remained part of the existing guild structure (or lack thereof). For example, an attempt was made in [[Leiden]] to set up a guild in 1610 specifically for painters to protect themselves against the sale of art from foreigners, especially those from areas of [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]] and the area around [[Antwerp]]. However, the town, which traditionally resisted guilds in general, only offered to help them from illegal imports.&lt;ref name="montias93"&gt;Montias (1977): 93.&lt;/ref&gt; Not until 1648 was a loosely organized "quasi-guild" permitted in that city.&lt;ref&gt;Prak (2003): 242.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Guilds of the small but wealthy seat of government The Hague and its near neighbour, Delft, were constantly battling to stop the other's artists encroaching into their city, often without success.  By the later part of the century a kind of balance was achieved, with The Hague's portraitists supplying both cities, whilst Delft's genre painters did the same.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
In [[Renaissance]] [[Florence]] the Guild of St. Luke, ''per se'', did not exist. Painters belonged to the guild of the Doctors and Apothecaries ("Arte dei Medici e Speziali") as they bought their pigments from the apothecaries, while sculptors were members of the Masters of Stone and Wood ("Maestri di Pietri e Legname).&lt;ref name="hughes3"&gt;Hughes (1986): 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; They were also frequently members in the confraternity of St. Luke (''Compagnia di San Luca'')—which had been founded as early as 1349—although it was a separate entity from the guild system.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20; Jack (1976): 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; There were similar confraternal organizations in other parts of Italy, such as Rome.  By the 16th century a guild had even been established in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in [[Crete]], then a Venetian possession, by the very successful Greek artists of the [[Cretan School]]. In the sixteenth century, the ''Compagnia di San Luca'' began to meet at [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata di Firenze|SS. Annunziata]], and sculptors, who had previously been members of a confraternity dedicated to St. Paul (''Compagnia di San Paolo''), also joined.&lt;ref&gt;Mather (1948): 20.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the ''compagnia'' developed into the Florentine [[Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze|Accademia del Disegno]] in 1563, which was then formally incorporated into the city's guild system in 1572.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; The Florence example, in fact, eventually acted more like a traditional guild structure than the [[Accademia di San Luca]] in [[Rome]].&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt; 

Founded by [[Federico Zuccari]] in 1593, Rome's Accademia reflects more clearly the "modern" notions of an artistic academy rather than perpetuating what has often been seen as the medieval nature of the guild system.&lt;ref name="hughes3" /&gt;  Gradually other cities were to follow the example of Rome and the [[Accademia degli Incamminati|Carracci]] in [[Bologna]], with leading painters founding an "Academy", not always initially in direct competition with the local Guilds, but tending to eclipse and supplant it in time. This shift in artistic representation is generally associated with the modern conception of the visual arts as a liberal rather than mechanical art, and occurred in cities across Europe. In Antwerp [[David Teniers the Younger]] was both a dean of the Guild and founded the [[Royal Academy of Fine Arts (Antwerp)|Academy]], while in Venice [[Pittoni]] and [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]] led a breakaway [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Venezia|Accademia]] from the old ''Fraglia dei Pittori'' as the local guild was known. The new academies began to offer training in drawing and the early stages of painting to students, and artistic theory, including the [[hierarchy of genres]], increased in importance.

==Guilds and intellectual pursuits==
[[File:Rhetoric-enthroned-invitation-antwerp-landjuweel-1561.jpg|thumb|Printed invitation to other [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]] by the Antwerp ''[[Violieren]]'', for a ''landjuweel'' event, lasting 19 days, in 1561]]
The late sixteenth-century elevation of artist's status that occurred in Italy was echoed in the Low Countries by increased participation by artists in literary and humanistic societies. The Antwerp Guild of St. Luke, in particular, was closely associated with one of the city's eminent [[Chamber of rhetoric|chambers of rhetoric]], the ''[[Violieren]]'', and, in fact, the two were often discussed as being the same.&lt;ref name="gibson431"&gt;Gibson (1981): 431 (also n. 37).&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-sixteenth century, when [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] was active in the city, most of the members of the ''Violieren'', including [[Frans Floris]], [[Cornelis Floris]], and [[Hieronymus Cock]], were artists.&lt;ref name="gibson431" /&gt; The relationship between the two organizations, one for professionals practicing a trade and the other a literary and dramatist group, continued into the seventeenth century until the two groups formally merged in 1663 when the Antwerp Academy was founded a century after its Roman counterpart. Similar relationships between the Guild of St. Luke and chambers of rhetoric appear to have existed in Dutch cities in the seventeenth century. [[Haarlem|Haarlem's]] "Liefde boven al" ("Love above all") is a prime example, to which [[Frans Hals]], [[Esaias van de Velde]], and [[Adriaen Brouwer]] all belonged.&lt;ref&gt;Heppner (1939): 23.&lt;/ref&gt; These activities also manifested themselves in groups that developed outside of the guild like Antwerp's [[Guild of Romanists|Romanists]], for whom travel to Italy and appreciation of classical and humanist culture were essential.

==Guild rules==
[[File:Judith Leyster - Self-Portrait - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|250px|left| [[Judith Leyster]] self-portrait at 20, three years before she became the second woman to join the Haarlem Guild in 1633]]
Guild rules varied greatly. In common with the Guilds for other trades, there would be an initial [[apprentice]]ship of at least three, more often five years. Typically, the apprentice would then qualify as a "[[journeyman]]", free to work for any Guild member.  Some artists began to sign and date paintings a year or two before they reached the next stage, which often involved a payment to the Guild, and was to become a "[[Master craftsman|free Master]]".   After this the artist could sell his own works, set up his own workshop with apprentices of his own, and also sell the work of other artists.  [[Anthony van Dyck]] achieved this at eighteen, but in the twenties would be more typical.   

In some places the maximum number of apprentices was specified (as for example two), especially in the earlier periods, and alternatively a minimum of one might be specified.  In [[Nuremberg]] painting, unlike say goldsmithing, was a "free trade" without a Guild and regulated directly by the city council; this was intended to encourage growth in a city where much art was becoming linked with book [[publishing]], for which Nuremberg was the largest German centre.  Nonetheless there were rules and for example only married men could operate a workshop.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002): 105-6.&lt;/ref&gt; In most cities the women who were important members of workshops making [[illuminated manuscript]]s were excluded from the Guild or from being masters; however not in Antwerp, where [[Caterina van Hemessen]] and others were members.  As the Christian title of the Guild suggested, Jews were excluded, at least from becoming masters, in most cities.  

When [[printmaking]] arrived, many [[engraver]]s were from a [[goldsmith]]ing background and stayed in that guild.  As that link weakened with the development of printmaking, some painter' guilds accepted [[engraver]]s or [[etcher]]s who did not paint as Members, and others did not.  In London painters on glass had their own separate guild with the glaziers; elsewhere they would be accepted by the painters.

The rules of the Delft guild have been much puzzled over by art historians seeking to illuminate the undocumented training of [[Vermeer]].  When he joined the Guild there in 1653, he must have received six years training, according to the local rules. In addition, he had to pay a six guilders admission fee, despite the fact that his father was a Guild member (as an art dealer), which would normally have meant only a three guilder fee. This appears to mean that his training had not been received in Delft itself. [[Pieter de Hooch]] on the other hand, as an immigrant to Delft, had to pay twelve guilders in 1655, which he could not afford to pay all at once.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, pp. 166, 285n60, 160,&lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect of the Guild rules is illustrated by the dispute between [[Frans Hals]] and [[Judith Leyster]] in Haarlem.  Leyster was the second woman in Haarlem to join the Guild, and probably trained with Hals - she was a witness at the [[baptism]] of his daughter.  Some years later, in 1635, she brought a dispute to the Guild complaining that one of her three apprentices had left her workshop after only a few days, and had been accepted into Hals' shop, in breach of Guild rules.  The Guild had the power to fine members, and after discovering that the apprentice had not been registered with them, fined both artists, and made a ruling on the apprentice's position.&lt;ref&gt;Franits, p.49&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Slive, p.129&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline of the guilds==
All guild local monopolies came under general economic disapproval from the 17th century onwards; in the particular case of painters there was in many places a tension between the Guilds and artists imported as court painter by a ruler.  When [[Anthony van Dyck]] was finally enticed to come to England by King Charles I, he was provided with a house at [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], then just outside the boundary of the [[City of London]] to avoid the monopoly of the London guild.  [[The Hague]] with its Catholic court, split itself in two in 1656 with the [[Confrerie Pictura]]. By that time it was clear to all involved that the one-stop-shop concept of a guild was past its prime, and to ensure high quality and high prices, the education of artists needed to be separated from sales venues. Many towns set up ''academy'' style schools for education, while sales could be generated from arranged viewings at local inns, estate sales, or open markets.  In Antwerp the Habsburg Governors eventually removed the Guild's monopoly, and by the end of the 18th century hardly any guild monopolies survived, even before [[Napoleon]] disbanded all guilds in territories he controlled.  Guilds survived as societies or charitable organisations, or merged with the newer "[[Academy#Academies_of_the_arts|Academies]]" - as happened in Antwerp, but not in London or Paris.  Guild monopoly had a brief 20th century revival in Eastern Europe under [[Communism]], where non-members of the official artist's union or guild found it very hard to work as painters - for example the Czech [[Josef Váchal]].

==Paintings for the guilds==
In many cities the Guild of Saint Luke financed a chapel that was decorated with an altarpiece of their patron saint.&lt;ref name="olds"&gt;Olds (1990): 89–96.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogier van der Weyden|Rogier van der Weyden's]] ''[[Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin]]'' ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]), one of the earliest-known paintings, set up a tradition that was followed by many subsequent artists.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; [[Jan Gossaert|Jan Gossaert's]] work in the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna]] (illustrated, top right) revisits Van der Weyden's composition while presenting the scene as a visionary experience instead of a directly witnessed portrait sitting.&lt;ref name="olds" /&gt; Later, [[Frans Floris]] (1556), [[Marten de Vos]] (1602) and [[Otto van Veen]] all represented the subject for the guild in Antwerp, and [[Abraham Janssens]] painted an altarpiece for the guild in [[Mechelen]] in 1605.&lt;ref&gt;King (1985): 254–255.&lt;/ref&gt; These paintings are frequently self-portraits with the artist as Luke, and often provide insight into artistic practices from the time when they were made since the subject is of an artist at work.

In [[Greek mythology]] and [[Roman mythology]], a '''harpy''' (plural '''harpies''', {{Lang-el|ἅρπυια}},&lt;ref&gt;Of uncertain etymology; [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] has suggested a [[Pre-Greek]] origin (''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 139).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|a(/rpuia|ἅρπυια|cite}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''harpyia'', {{IPA-el|hárpyi̯a|pron}}; {{lang-lat|harpȳia}}) was a half-human and half-[[bird]] personification of storm winds, in [[Homer|Homeric poems]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]]. ''[[Odyssey]], Book 20.66 &amp; 77''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Descriptions ==
They were generally depicted as birds with the heads of maidens, faces pale with hunger and long claws on their hands. Roman and Byzantine writers detailed their ugliness.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid, Book 3.216''; Tzetzes. ''ad Lycoph.'' ''653''; Ovid. ''Metamorphoses Book 7.4, Fasti, Book 6.132''; Hyginus. ''Fabulae, 14''&lt;/ref&gt; Pottery art depicting the harpies featured beautiful women with wings. Ovid described them as human-vultures.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid. ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' vii.4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hesiod ===
To Hesiod, they were imagined as fair-locked and winged maidens, who surpassed winds and birds in the rapidity of their flight. &lt;blockquote&gt;''"...the Harpyiai (Harpies) of the lovely hair, Okypete (Ocypete) and Aello, and these two in the speed of their wings keep pace with the blowing winds, or birds in flight, as they soar and swoop, high aloft."''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Aeschylus ===
But even as early as the time of [[Aeschylus]], they are described as ugly creatures with wings, and later writers carry their notions of the harpies so far as to represent them as most disgusting monsters. The [[Sibyl|Pythian priestess]] of [[Apollo]] recounted the appearance of the harpies in the following lines:&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Before this man an extraordinary band of women [i.e. harpies] slept, seated on thrones. No! Not women, but rather Gorgons I call them; and yet I cannot compare them to forms of Gorgons either. Once before I saw some creatures in a painting, carrying off the feast of [[Phineus]]; but these are wingless in appearance, black, altogether disgusting; they snore with repulsive breaths, they drip from their eyes hateful drops; their attire is not fit to bring either before the statues of the gods or into the homes of men. I have never seen the tribe that produced this company, nor the land that boasts of rearing this brood with impunity and does not grieve for its labor afterwards."''&lt;ref&gt;[[Aeschylus]]. ''[http://topostext.org/work.php?work_id=14 Eumenides, 50]'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Virgil ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Bird-bodied, girl-faced things they (Harpies) are; abominable their droppings, their hands are talons, their faces haggard with hunger insatiable"''&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid, Book 3.216 {{PD-notice}}''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hyginus ===
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"They are said to have been feathered, with cocks' heads, wings, and human arms, with great claws; breasts, bellies, and female parts human."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]]. ''Fabulae, 14'' {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Functions and abode ==
The harpies seem originally to have been wind spirits (personifications of the destructive nature of wind). Their name means "snatchers" or "swift robbers"&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Room]], Who's Who in Classical Mythology, p. 147 {{ISBN|0-517-22256-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they steal food from their victims while they are eating and carry evildoers (especially those who have killed their family) to the [[Erinyes]]. When a person suddenly disappeared from the earth, it was said that he had been carried off by the harpies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]] ''[[Odyssey]], Book 1.241, 14.371''&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they carried off the daughters of king Pandareus and gave them as servants to the Erinyes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Homer]]. ''[[Odyssey]], Book 20.78''&lt;/ref&gt; In this form they were agents of punishment who abducted people and tortured them on their way to [[Tartarus]]. They were vicious, cruel and violent.

The harpies were called "the hounds of mighty [[Zeus]]" thus "ministers of the Thunderer (Zeus)".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Valerius Flaccus. ''Argonautica Book 4.425''&lt;/ref&gt; Later writers listed the harpies among the guardians of the [[Hades|underworld]] among other monstrosities including the [[Centaur]]s, [[Scylla]], [[Hecatoncheires|Briareus]], [[Lernaean Hydra]], [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]], [[Gorgon]]s and [[Geryon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Virgil]]. ''Aeneid 6.287 ff''; [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. ''Hercules Furens 747 ff''&lt;/ref&gt;

Their abode is either the islands called [[Strophades]],&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid, Book 3.210''&lt;/ref&gt; a place at the entrance of [[Orcus]],&lt;ref&gt;Virgil. ''Aeneid, Book 6.289''&lt;/ref&gt; or a cave in Crete.&lt;ref&gt;Apollonius. ''Argonautica, Book 2.298''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Names and family ==
[[Hesiod]] calls them two "lovely-haired" creatures, the daughters of [[Thaumas]] and the [[Oceanid]] [[Electra (Oceanid)|Electra]] and sisters of [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'', 265–267. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyginus]], however, cited a certain Ozomene&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]]. ''Fabulae 14''&lt;/ref&gt; as the mother of the harpies but he also recounted that Electra was also the mother of these beings in the same source. This can be explained by the fact that Ozomene was another name for Electra. The harpies possibly were siblings of the river-god [[Hydaspes (mythology)|Hydaspes]] and [[Arke (mythology)|Arke]], as they were called sisters of Iris and children of Thaumas. According to [[Gaius Valerius Flaccus|Valerius]], Typhoeus ([[Typhon]]) was said to be the father of these monsters&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; while a different version by [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] told that the harpies were daughters of [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]] and [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaea]] or of [[Poseidon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]]. ''ad Aeneid, Book 3.241''&lt;/ref&gt;

They are named [[Aello]] ("storm swift") and [[Ocypete]] ("the swift wing"),&lt;ref&gt;Hesiod. ''Theogony 265''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pseudo-Apollodorus]]. ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]], Book 1.121-123.''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Virgil]] added [[Celaeno]] ("the dark") as a third.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, Aeneid 3.209&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homer]] knew of a harpy named [[Podarge]] ("fleet-foot").&lt;ref&gt;Homer, Iliad 16.148&lt;/ref&gt; Aello, is sometimes also spelled Aellopus or Nicothoe; Ocypete, sometimes also spelled Ocythoe or Ocypode.

Homer called the harpy Podarge as the mother of the two horses ([[Balius and Xanthus]]) of [[Achilles]] sired by the West Wind [[Zephyrus]]&lt;ref&gt;Homer''.

==Mythology==
[[File:Harpij - I.I Schipper 1660, graveur Matthius Merian, naar J.Jonstons' "Naekeurige Beschryvingh van de Natuur".jpg|thumb|left|A harpy in [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]]'s ''Monstrorum Historia'', Bologna, 1642]]

=== Argonauts ===
[[File:Harpyie.JPG|thumb|A [[medieval]] depiction of a harpy as a bird-woman]]
 
The most celebrated story in which the harpies play a part is that of King [[Phineus]] of [[Thrace]], who was given the gift of [[prophecy]] by Zeus. Angry that Phineus gave away the god's secret plan, Zeus punished him by blinding him and putting him on an island with a buffet of food which he could never eat because the harpies always arrived to steal the food out of his hands before he could satisfy his hunger. Later writers add that they either devoured the food themselves, or that they dirtied it by dropping upon it some stinking substance, so as to render it unfit to be eaten.

This continued until the arrival of [[Jason]] and the [[Argonauts]]. Phineus promised to instruct them respecting the course they had to take, if they would deliver him from the harpies. The [[Boreads]], sons of [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]], the North Wind, who also could fly, succeeded in driving off the harpies. According to an ancient oracle, the harpies were to perish by the hands of the Boreades, but the latter were to die if they could not overtake the harpies. The latter fled, but one fell into the river Tigris, which was hence called Harpys, and the other reached the Echinades, and as she never returned, the islands were called Strophades. But being worn out with fatigue, she fell down simultaneously with her pursuer; and, as they promised no further to molest Phineus, the two harpies were not deprived of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Apollodorus. ''Bibliotheca, Book 1.9.21''&lt;/ref&gt; According to others, the Boreades were on the point of killing the harpies, when Iris or Hermes appeared and commanded the conquerors to set them free, promising that Phineus would not be bothered by the harpies again.  "The dogs of great Zeus" then returned to their "cave in Minoan Crete". Other accounts said that both the harpies as well as the Boreades died.&lt;ref&gt;Scholia. ''ad Apollon. Rhod''. ''i. 286, 297''; Tzetzes. ''Chiliades, i. 217''&lt;/ref&gt; Thankful for their help, Phineus told the Argonauts how to pass the [[Symplegades]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Argonautica]]'', book II; [[Ovid]] XIII, 710; [[Virgil]] III, 211, 245&lt;/ref&gt;

Tzetzes explained the origin of the myth pertaining to Phineus, the harpies, and the Boreades in his account. In this late version of the myth it was said that Phineus, due to his old age, became blind, and he has two daughters named Eraseia and Harpyreia. These maidens lived a very libertine and lazy life, abandoning themselves to poverty and fatal famine. Then Zetes and Calais snatched them away somehow, and they disappeared from those places ever since. From this account all myths about them [i.e., the harpies] started, as was also retold by Apollonius in his own story of the Argonauts.&lt;ref&gt;Tzetzes. ''ad Lycophron, 166, Chiliades, 1.220''; Palaephaust. ''23. 3''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Aeneid ===
[[Aeneas]] encountered harpies on the Strophades as they repeatedly made off with the feast the [[Troy|Trojans]] were setting. [[Celaeno]] utters a prophecy: the Trojans will be so hungry they will eat their tables before they reach the end of their journey. The Trojans fled in fear.

== Modern reception ==
[[File:DVinfernoForestOfSuicides m.jpg|thumb|Harpies in the infernal wood, from ''Inferno'' XIII, by [[Gustave Doré]], 1861]]

=== Dante ===
Harpies remained vivid in the Middle Ages. In Canto XIII of his ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', [[Dante Alighieri]] envisages the tortured wood infested with harpies, where the [[suicide]]s have their punishment in the [[Inferno (Dante)#Seventh Circle (Violence)|seventh ring of Hell]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Here the repellent harpies make their nests,''&lt;br&gt;''Who drove the Trojans from the Strophades'' &lt;br&gt;''With dire announcements of the coming woe.'' &lt;br&gt;''They have broad wings, with razor sharp talons and a human neck and face,''&lt;br&gt;''Clawed feet and swollen, feathered bellies; they caw''&lt;br&gt;''Their lamentations in the eerie trees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://new.bostonreview.net/BR18.1/dante.html Translation of Robert Pinsky, ''Boston Review''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104235244/http://new.bostonreview.net/BR18.1/dante.html |date=2014-11-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William Blake]] was inspired by Dante's description in his pencil, ink and watercolour  "[[The Wood of the Self-Murderers: The Harpies and the Suicides]]" (Tate Gallery, London).[[File:Großes Wappen von Nürnberg.svg|thumb|190px|Greater coat of arms of the city of [[Nuremberg]]]]

===Linguistic use and application===
The [[harpy eagle]] is a real bird named after the mythological animal.

The term is often used metaphorically to refer to a nasty or annoying woman. In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', Benedick&lt;!--Benedick, not Benedict--&gt; spots the sharp-tongued Beatrice approaching and exclaims to the prince, Don Pedro, that he would do an assortment of arduous tasks for him "rather than hold three words conference with this harpy!"

===Heraldry===
In the [[Middle Ages]], the harpy, often called the ''Jungfrauenadler''{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} or "maiden eagle" (although it may not have been modeled after the original harpy of Greek mythology), became a popular [[charge (heraldry)|charge]] in [[heraldry]], particularly in [[East Frisia]], seen on, among others, the [[coat-of-arms|coats-of-arms]] of [[County of Rietberg|Rietberg]], [[Coat of arms of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], and the [[Cirksena]].

==In popular culture==
{{In popular culture|date=December 2016}}
Harpies are referenced in present-day culture, especially in fiction and fantasy. They tend to be evil-aligned.{{fact|date=January 2018}}

Examples include:

* In [[Carl Barks]]' ''[[Donald Duck]]'' story "The Golden Fleecing" (1955), [[Scrooge McDuck]], [[Donald Duck]] and [[Huey, Louie and Dewey]] meet creatures who are half women and half birds and are named "Larkies", despite clearly being modelled after the mythological harpy birds. He was forced to use this name, because ''harpy'' was also a [[slang]] term for 'street prostitute'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYP2Cj_Gb98C|title=Carl Barks and the Disney Comic Book: Unmasking the Myth of Modernity|first=Tom|last=Andrae|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Univ.

'''Julius Klinger''' (22 May 1876 – 1942) was an [[Austria]]n painter, draftsman, illustrator, commercial graphic artist, typographer and writer. Klinger studied at the Technologisches Gewerbemuseum in [[Vienna]].&lt;ref name="AEIOU "&gt;[http://www.aeiou.at/aeiou.encyclop.k/k464961.htm;internal&amp;action=_setlanguage.action?LANGUAGE=en Austrian AEIOU Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Meggendorfer Blätter 27.03.1930.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Meggendorfer Blätter,&amp;nbsp;1930]]
Klinger was born in Dornbach near [[Vienna]]. In 1895, he found his first employment with the [[Vienna]] fashion magazine ''Wiener Mode''. Here he made acquaintance with [[Koloman Moser]], who later would be his teacher; Moser recommended him to the ''[[Meggendorfer-Blätter]]''.&lt;ref name="onbJK"&gt;[http://www2.onb.ac.at/siteseeing/flu/schaetze_neu/schaetze-kuenstler.htm Julius Klinger (Wien 22. 5. 1976-1942?)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918024028/http://www2.onb.ac.at/siteseeing/flu/schaetze_neu/schaetze-kuenstler.htm |date=2008-09-18 }}, biographical entry with the [[Austrian National Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;

1896 saw him moving to [[Munich]] where he worked as an illustrator for the ''Meggendorfer-Blätter''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Ciarlo|title=Advertising Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ceZNb2h4BQC&amp;pg=PA292|accessdate=4 September 2016|date=January 2011|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-05006-8|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. From 1897 to 1902 he was a collaborator to the eponymous [[Jugendstil]] magazine ''[[Die Jugend]]''.

== Berlin ==
[[Image:Julius Klinger Möhring Kronleuchter 1908.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Julius Klinger:&amp;nbsp;1908, Möhring&amp;nbsp;candelabra&amp;nbsp;factory]]
In 1897 he relocated to Berlin, where he worked extensively as a commercial graphic artist until 1915. Together with the printing house Hollerbaum und Schmidt, he developed a new fashion of functional poster design that soon gained him international reputation.&lt;ref name="onbJK" /&gt; In 1912 he designed the poster for the ''Rund um Berlin'' air show in [[Johannisthal Air Field|Johannisthal]]. In Berlin he also contributed to ''Das kleine Witzblatt'', ''Lustige Blätter'' and ''Das Narrenschiff'' humorous magazines.

== Advertising campaign for the "Tabu" company ==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Julius Klinger Tabu Poster 1919.jpg|thumb|100px|left|J. Klinger: Poster&amp;nbsp;ca.&amp;nbsp;1919]] --&gt;
Beginning in 1918, Klinger designed a comprehensive and noted campaign promoting the "Tabu" company's cigarette rolling paper, that was advertised all over Vienna in 1918/19. Klinger devised a promotional strategy, spanning from small-sized newspaper advertisements to billboards and painted [[Firewall (construction)|firewalls]] – construction site fences and winterized fountain paneling were used as advertising space, too.&lt;ref name="onb2003"&gt;[http://www.onb.ac.at/sammlungen/plakate/archiv/erwerb/objekt_juni_2003.htm Plakat: Julius Klinger: Tabu, 1919] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040823140137/http://www.onb.ac.at/sammlungen/plakate/archiv/erwerb/objekt_juni_2003.htm |date=2004-08-23 }}, [[Austrian National Library]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nazi persecution ==
[[Image:Julius Klinger Ankerbrot 1938.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Julius Klinger, late&amp;nbsp;1937,&amp;nbsp;Vienna]]
Being of Jewish descent, he suffered from [[Nazism|national socialist]] harassment. According to Viennese police records, he was registered as ''moved to [[Minsk]]'' on 2 June 1942, i.e. deported. Presumably, he was killed the same year.&lt;ref name="onbJK" /&gt;

Probably towards the end of 1937 he designed his last poster for the Ankerbrot-Werke factory. The Jewish-owned company was transferred to "''Aryan''" proprietors in 1938; after 1945 legitimate ownership was restored.

'''''Lady Lilith''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] first painted in 1866–68 using his mistress [[Fanny Cornforth]] as the model, then altered in 1872–73 to show the face of [[Alexa Wilding]].&lt;ref name="Rarchive"/&gt; The subject is [[Lilith]], who was, according to ancient [[Judaic]] myth, "the first wife of [[Adam]]" and is associated with the seduction of men and the [[child murder|murder of children]]. She is shown as a "powerful and evil temptress" and as "an iconic, [[Amazons|Amazon]]-like female with long, flowing hair."&lt;ref name="DAM"&gt;[http://www.delart.org/collections/preraph/lady_lilith.html Delaware Art Museum, ''Lady Lilith] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233622/http://www.delart.org/collections/preraph/lady_lilith.html |date=25 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Rossetti overpainted Cornforth's face, perhaps at the suggestion of his client, shipping magnate [[Frederick Richards Leyland]], who displayed the painting in his drawing room with five other Rossetti "stunners."&lt;ref name="Rarchive"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  After Leyland's death, the painting was purchased by [[Samuel Bancroft]] and Bancroft's estate donated it in 1935 to the [[Delaware Art Museum]] where it is now displayed.

The painting forms a pair with ''Sibylla Palmifera'', painted 1866–70, also with Wilding as the model.  ''Lady Lilith'' represents the body's beauty, according to Rossetti's sonnet inscribed on the frame.  ''Sibylla Palmifera'' represents the soul's beauty, according to the Rossetti sonnet on its frame.

A large 1867 replica of ''Lady Lilith'', painted by Rossetti in [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]], which shows the face of Cornforth, is now owned by New York's [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]. It has a verse from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'' as translated by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]] on a label attached by Rossetti to its frame:

{{Quotation|"Beware of her fair hair, for she excells&lt;!--excells in original--&gt;&lt;br/&gt;All women in the magic of her locks,&lt;br/&gt;And when she twines them round a young man's neck&lt;br/&gt;she will not ever set him free again."&lt;ref name="met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/08.162.1 "Dante Gabriel Rossetti: Lady Lilith (08.162.1)"]. In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–.  (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Painting==
On 9 April 1866 Rossetti wrote to Frederick Leyland: 
{{Quote|As you continue to express a wish to have a good picture of mine, I write you word of another I have now begun, which will be one of my best.  The picture represents a lady combing her hair.  It is the same size as ''Palmifera'' – 36 x 31 inches, and will be full of material, – a landscape seen in the background.  Its color chiefly white and silver, with a great mass of golden hair.&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p.186.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''Lady Lilith'' was commissioned by Leyland in early 1866 and delivered to him in early 1869 at a price of £472. 10 s.  
Two studies, dated to 1866, exist for the work, but two notebook sketches may be from an earlier date. The painting focuses on Lilith, but is meant to be a "Modern Lilith" rather than the mythological figure. She contemplates her own beauty in her hand-mirror. The painting is one of a series of Rossetti paintings of such "mirror pictures."

Rossetti's assistant, [[Henry Treffry Dunn]], states that the final part painted was the flowery background. He and G. P. Boyce gathered large baskets of white roses from  [[John Ruskin]]'s garden in [[Denmark Hill]], and returned with them to Rossetti's house in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]]. Dunn is thought to have later recreated Rossetti's picture of Lady Lilith in coloured chalk.&lt;ref name=dunn&gt;{{cite web|title=Henry Treffry Dunn – Past Auction Results|url=http://www.artnet.com/Artists/LotDetailPage.aspx?lot_id=0F957DD0E84DA61A628844E360BFD8D7 |publisher=Artnet|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sources disagree on whether Leyland or Rossetti initiated the repainting,&lt;ref&gt;''Waking Dreams'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rarchive"/&gt; but the major change was the substitution of Alexa Wilding's face for Cornforth's.  The painting was returned to Rossetti in February 1872, and he completed the repainting on 2 December at [[Kelmscott Manor]] before returning it to Leyland.&lt;ref name="Rarchive"/&gt;&lt;ref name=lee/&gt; Alexa was born Alice Wilding and was about 27 years old at the time of the repainting.  Rossetti paid her a retainer of £1 per week for modelling.

The white roses may indicate cold, sensuous love and reflect the tradition that roses first "blushed" or turned red upon meeting [[Eve]]. The poppy in the lower right hand corner may indicate sleep and forgetfulness and reflect the languid nature of Lilith.  Foxgloves, near the mirror, may indicate insincerity.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Sarah Phelps. “Dante Gabriel Rossetti's ‘Lady Lilith’ and the Language of Flowers.” Arts Magazine 53 (1979): 142–145.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Rossetti's assistants, Charles Fairfax Murray, who had created copies of his master's work claimed that some paintings later attributed to Rossetti were actually painted by his assistants. Murray claimed that the ''Lady Lilith'' in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] was painted by Henry Treffry Dunn and was just "touched up" by Rossetti.&lt;ref name=thomas&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=David Wayne|title=Cultivating Victorians: liberal culture and the aesthetic p.128|year=2004|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|pages=229|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_yU6OXCO18kC&amp;dq=%22Henry+Treffry+Dunn%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rossetti began painting ''Sibylla Palmifera'' before persuading George Rae to commission it&lt;ref name="Rarchive2"/&gt; in late 1865. The final price was 400 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].  He worked sporadically on the painting and only completed it in December 1870.  In June 1869 he received £200 from Leyland for a copy that was never completed.

The name Palmifera means "palm-bearer," and the model holds a palm in her hands. The palm, together with the inclusion of [[butterfly|butterflies]], may indicate the spiritual nature of the painting. This painting also has flower symbolism – using red roses and poppies in this case – and an unrealistic background space.&lt;ref name="Rarchive2"&gt;{{cite web

Rossetti wrote the sonnet "Soul's Beauty" to accompany the painting ''Sibylla Palmifera'',&lt;ref name="Rarchive2"/&gt; just as he wrote the sonnet "Lilith" to accompany the painting ''Lady Lilith''.
Both pairs of poems and pictures were first published, side-by-side, in [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s ''Notes on the Royal Academy Exhibition'' in 1868.  In 1870 the poems were published again in Rossetti's ''Sonnets for Pictures''.

It was not until 1881 however that the sonnets became a true pair.  At that time Rossetti decided to directly contrast the two poems, renamed "Lilith" to "Body's Beauty" and published them on consecutive pages of his book ''The House of Life'' as sonnets LXXVII and LXXVIII.&lt;ref name="Rarchive2"/&gt;&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite book|last=Rossetti|first=Date Gabriel|title=The House of Life|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/3692}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Feminist perspective==
In myth, [[Lilith]] is a powerful, threatening, sexual woman who resists domination by men.  Thus she has been considered a symbol of the feminist movement.  In the painting she concentrates on her own beauty, luxuriates in her free, sensual hair, lacks the usual [[Victorian fashion|Victorian]] [[corset]], and wears "clothes that look as if they are soon to be removed."&lt;ref name="Scerba"&gt;{{cite web

In ''The Power of Women's Hair in the Victorian Imagination,'' Elizabeth G. Gitter writes:

Samuel Bancroft, a textile mill owner from [[Wilmington, Delaware]], bought the painting at Leyland's estate sale, held at [[Christie's]] on 28 May 1892, for £525.  He bought at least four other Rossetti paintings at the same time and later accumulated one of the largest collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside of the United Kingdom.  The Bancroft estate donated Bancroft's extensive collection of paintings in 1935 to the [[Delaware Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=prb&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.preraph.org/history/|publisher=Delaware Art Museum|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Pottery]] and [[ceramics]]''' have been produced in '''[[the Levant]]''' since prehistoric times. 

==Historic background==

=== Neolithic Period ===
The history of pottery in the region begins in the Late [[Neolithic]] period, sometimes known as Pottery Neolithic (PN) or occasionally, based on a supposed local sequence of the site of [[Jericho]], Pottery Neolithic A.

==== Pre-pottery Neolithic (ca. 8300– ca. 5500 BC) ====
There is no good evidence for pottery production in Early Neolithic (Pre-pottery Neolithic/PP) times, but the existence of pyrotechnology that allowed humans to attain temperatures in excess of [[1 E3 K|1000 °C]] for reducing [[limestone]] to [[Calcium oxide|lime]] to make [[Plaster#Lime plaster|plaster]], indicates a level of technology ripe for the discovery of pottery and its spread. In the PPN period portable vessels of lime plaster, called "vaisselles blanche" or [[White_Ware|"White Ware"]] served some of the functions that pottery later fulfilled. These vessels tended to be rather large and coarse and were somewhat rare.

There are some indications that pottery may have been in use in the third and final phase of Early Neolithic, PPNC (recognized Early Neolithic phases are, beginning with the earliest, [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic A|PPNA]], [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic B|PPNB]] and [[Pre-Pottery Neolithic C|PPNC]]); however such artifacts are rare, their [[provenance]] equivocal and the issue remains in doubt. Approximately sometime in the late 6th millennium BC pottery was introduced into the southern Levant and it became widely used. The supposedly sophisticated forms and technological and decorative aspects suggested to archaeologists that it must have been received as an imported, technological advance from adjacent regions to the north and was not developed locally. The evidence for this hypothesis, however, remains equivocal for lack of documentation in the archaeological record. This hypothesis also does not take into account the bulk of simple, rudely fashioned vessels that were part of the ceramic repertoire of this period.

==== Pottery Neolithic (ca. 5500–ca. 4500 BC) ====
Because of discoveries of earlier pottery traditions made starting in the 1990s, the time frame for the initial Late Neolithic ceramic period is thought to be roughly 7000-6700 BCE.&lt;ref name=Bernbeck2013&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bernbeck|first1=Reinhard|last2=Nieuwenhuyse|first2=Olivier|editor1-last=Nieuwenhuyse|editor1-first=Olivier|editor2-last=Akkermans|editor2-first=Peter|editor3-last=Bernbeck|editor3-first=Reinhard|editor4-last=Rogasch|editor4-first=Jana|title=Interpreting the late Neolithic of Upper Mesopotamia|date=2013|publisher=Brepols|location=Turnhout|isbn=978-2-503-54001-6|pages=17-37|series=Papers on Archaeology from The Leiden Museum of Antiquities (PALMA 9)|chapter=Introduction: Established Paradigms, Current Disputes and Emerging Themes: The State of Research on the Late Neolithic in Upper Mesopotamia|chapterurl=https://is.muni.cz/el/1421/jaro2013/PAPVA_42/um/40791983/01_ILNUM_Intro_FinalVersion_15-11-12_Chronologies.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; These earliest pottery traditions may be known in literature as 'Initial Pottery Neolithic' in the [[Balikh River]] area of Syria and Turkey, for example [[Tell Sabi Abyad]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sabi-abyad.nl/Page.aspx?pageType=page&amp;pageID=399 The very oldest pottery of Tell Sabi Abyad (and of Syria), 7000-6700 BC] www.sabi-abyad.nl&lt;/ref&gt; Or it may be known as 'Halula I' in the Syrian Euphrates area; the main site is [[Tell Halula]]. Also, it may be known as 'Rouj 2a' in Northern Levantine Rouj basin ([[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]], Syria).&lt;ref name=Bernbeck2013/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.histanth.tsukuba.ac.jp/tap/elrouj/WWW/rouj/rouj-map.html Syro-Japanese Archaeological Investigation - Rouj Basin Project, Syria]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the earliest PN phase pottery was ubiquitous and it remained so for virtually all periods in the southern Levant until modern times. Exceptions were in desert areas where semi-nomads favored less heavy, fragile and bulky arrangements. Pottery styles, based mostly on form, fabric and decorative elements have been used to help identify chrono-cultural phases. White ware remained in use, but it seems to have remained rare and the vessels were often small and rather delicate. It is possible that not a few such vessels were found and identified as pottery.

The earliest PN phase is associated with the site of [[Sha'ar HaGolan]] in the Jordan Valley. This pottery is sometimes called "[[Yarmukian]] Ware". The diagnostic pottery typical of this period is somewhat sophisticated. Its most outstanding aspect is the use of long, narrow, incised bands of lines filled with herringbone decoration, often painted red or yellow. Forms of vessels may be quite delicate and [[Lug (knob)|lug]] handles on small jars with long necks are not uncommon. More common, coarser and less well made vessels are also present but are less diagnostic for the period.

Common or cruder wares generally have simple shapes and are often less well finished and are not decorated. Vessel walls of this class are often of uneven thickness and look 'lumpy'. This crude aspect is often further emphasized by grass-wiped exteriors and the negative impressions left by straw or vegetal tempers (i.e. chopped up dried grass or weeds)which combust and leave hollows after firing. These inclusion were either added intentionally, or are the unintentional result of poorly levigated (i.e. a process of purifying clay by removal of natural, non-clay inclusions such as stones and plant materials) or unlevigated clay, and are characteristic of this coarse Neolithic pottery. Later Neolithic pottery tends to favor the use of different tempers, sand, gravel, small stones and sometimes grog (ground up pottery). Much Neolithic pottery is low-fired and did not attain temperatures far above 600°C, which is more or less the minimum required for creating pottery from low-fired clays. Probably these vessels were [[pit fired pottery|pit-fired]] rather than fired in [[kiln]]s, although such an hypothesis remains to be proven. To date there is no direct evidence in excavation based literature on how Neolithic peoples of the southern Levant fired their pottery.  

Later Neolithic pottery has less distinctive features. Work at [[Jericho]] by [[Kathleen Kenyon|K. Kenyon]] suggested to her two periods of Late Neolithic, based on the existence of coarser and finer pottery groups. The former, supposedly representing a less sophisticated and earlier occupation, was labeled PNA (Pottery Neolithic A); the latter was called PNB (Pottery Neolithic B). Many researchers now believe the difference to be one of function rather than evidence for chronological differences between these two groups, since examples of each are often found in contemporary contexts. Thus, PNB types are often designated as fine or luxury wares.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The site of [[Munhatta]], excavated by [[Jean Perrot|J. Perrot]], has contributed a large series of ceramic assemblages dated to the Neolithic period. In one phase there are some extraordinarily sophisticated ceramic vessels of especially finely levigated, highly polished or burnished (polishing of almost dry, leather hard, surfaces of unfired clay to produce a smooth surface that becomes shiny when fired), black fabric. Other pottery suggests that some potters in this period, dated later than an earlier, "Yarmukian" phase at the site (identified by Sha'ar HaGolan type pottery), were highly skilled craftspeople. One researcher, [[Yosef Garfinkel|Y. Garfinkel]], refers to this phase as "Jericho IX" after a stratum and associated pottery excavated by [[John Garstang|J. Garstang]] at Jericho (he excavated at Jericho prior to Kenyon). The decorated pottery of this period often has red paint in the form of stripes, sometimes in large, wide herringbone-like decorations. 

Not all pottery from these phases is so chrono-culturally diagnostic. Most vessels are of plain wares and utilitarian types.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} In addition, other methods of decoration are known in the later Neolithic. They include the use of slips (color applied to an entire vessel), burnishing and incising (e.g. notching, combing, slashing, etc.). Wavy lines of combing, often combined with painting are one of the distinctive types of Late Neolithic decoration associated with the Rabah phase (see below). The use of red slips and paints is common in this and later periods, and is probably the direct outcome of clays used, which are rich in iron oxides that tend, under some conditions, to fire to earthy red tones ranging from brown to orange and brick-red. These same clays, when fired in a reducing atmosphere (i.e. devoid of oxygen) often become gray or black in color. Dark colored, gray to black cores on some pots indicate incomplete firing

The most recent PN phase is named after the site of [[Wadi Rabah]], excavated by J. Kaplan. Y. Garfinkel relegates this final LN period to Early Chalcolithic. The distinction seems to be mostly a matter of terminology. Since there is no definitive break between Late Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic, each researcher must decide what is Neolithic and what is Early Chalcolithic. The situation is even more complicated because there appears to be considerable regional variation in Neolithic pottery assemblages and not a little confusion as to what constitutes chrono-culturally related assemblages. That is a function of the generally poor preservation of PN sites and the way in which they were excavated. 
 
Summary: Neolithic pottery may well have arrived as a full-blown technological set from more northerly regions. Pottery appears to have become ubiquitous in the southern Levant by late in the 6th millennium and remained as an integral part of human material culture up to the present. Some local potters showed particular skill in their production, which suggests, as is the case with flint knappers, real craft specialization. That is related to skills in finding and preparing raw materials, fashioning pots, decorating them, and controlling the pyrotechnology needed to turn them into pottery. Some aspects of pottery, form, fabric, modes of decoration are relatively reliable diagnostic indicators of chrono-cultural identities of human society. Pottery, mostly in the form of [[sherd]]s, often makes up the bulk of material culture artifacts found on excavated sites dating from the PN period.

==== Chalcolithic Period (Early 4th Millennium BCE–ca. 3500 BCE) ====
The [[Chalcolithic]] (or "Copper-Stone Age") is a chrono-cultural period that may have lasted for over a millennium, although the date of its end is somewhat problematic. The earliest phases of this period are associated with pottery that is little different from the pottery of the Latest Neolithic periods (see Late Neolithic Pottery). While plain wares probably dominate most assemblages, it is the decorated types which have been paid most attention to by scholars. There are few well excavated sites and no good stratigraphic sequences that have produced enough well-stratified pottery to allow for the development of any reliable chronological sequence in pottery styles, although some are claimed. Pottery of the Chalcolithic period can, for the present, be divided into two major chronological groups, Early and Late Chalcolithic. The more distinctive is the later group, known from some extensively excavated sites which have yielded large ceramic repertoires. There appear to be regional differences, especially between the northern and southern spheres of the southern Levant and at sites to the east. Some of these differences may also be chronological; new 14C (radiocarbon) dates suggest one type site, [[Teleilat el Ghassul]] in the northern [[Arabah|Aravah Valley]] in Jordan, is somewhat earlier in date than a group of sites in the [[Beersheba|Beersheva Basin]]. Garfinkel's attempt to divide this period into three phases, Early, Middle and Late, is based on a number of spurious assemblages and is lacking in authority. While such chronological distinctions may be possible, not enough is presently known of the sequence of the Chalcolithic for determining it. 

Pottery of the Early Chalcolithic period is often similar to that of the Late Neolithic. One diagnostic feature of this period is found in pottery made on  mats, probably of straw. When this was the case, the clay was pressed into the weave of the mat, leaving an impression which potters sometimes did not remove. Thus some bases of vessels in this period bear distinct patterns of mats on which they were made. Other techniques used for pottery production in this period include painting and slipping of exteriors, and the limited use of incised decoration, sometimes in a fish bone pattern but of usually much larger dimensions than that associated with Yarmukian pottery. One specialized form associated with this period is the so-called 'torpedo' vessel, a long narrow, thick-walled jar with two large, vertical lugs attached to its upper, almost tube-like body. Pottery of the Late Chalcolithic period sees a continuation of many of the basic shapes and types of the earlier period, but much of the typical decoration of the earlier Chalcolithic is discontinued.

Late Chalcolithic pottery is known for some special shapes including: 1)cornets—cone-like vessels with narrow apertures and long, highly tapered sides ending in exaggerated, long stick-like bases; 2) (so-called)churns or bird vessels, barrel-shaped vessels, often with bow shaped neck, one flat end and two lugs at either horizontal end of barrel, intended for suspension; 3) small bowls with straight sides tapering to flat bases (so-called V-shaped despite the flat bases; fenestrated-pedestaled bowls, small vases with vertical lugs pierced circularly, vertical tube handles, large holemouths with broad shoulders and relatively narrow bases. 

Small bowls and cornets of this period can be especially thin and appear to have been turned on wheels, but they are only finished that way. Recent research on the techniques of bowl making in this period indicate these vessels, while turned on a wheel, were actually only finished that way by scraping, after having been fashioned by hand. There is no evidence to show that the fast [[potter's wheel]] was used in the Chalcolithic period for 'throwing pots' using centripetal force. The wavy line or indented ledge handle makes its appearance in the central littoral in this period, presaging its adoption as the most common type of handle throughout the Early Bronze Age. Common decorations include raised, rope-like bands on some vessels, red painting and pie-crust like decoration on rims of large vessels (excepting holemouths. Combing, that produced wide, broad, flat lines, is sometimes found on jars of the Late Chalcolithic. Pronounced regional variations as well as functions of sites determine the kinds of vessels, types of clay used, and the forms of decoration preferred. Chalcolithic pottery technology and morphology greatly influenced the ceramic styles of the succeeding Early Bronze I period, especially in the southern region.

Specialized production of ossuaries (boxes intended to hold bones after decarnation; i.e., secondary burials) is well documented in this period. It includes many types of rectangular boxes, some with extremely elaborate facades. Some anthropomorphic visages appear on these ossuaries in three-dimensional sculpting (rare), often with the nose particularly prominently, while other features are generally painted. Some ossuaries are fashioned of typical jars, altered and adorned for this specific mortuary-related function.

=== Early Bronze Age (ca. 3500 – ca. 2300 BCE) ===

Abandonment of many sites at the end of the Chalcolithic period and major changes in material culture led archaeologists to name the post Chalcolithic period the "[[Early Bronze Age]]," a misnomer (only copper without tin {copper + tin = bronze} was in use) that has become an accepted convention. Pottery continued to be made in quantity and, until quite recently there was thought to have been a thoroughgoing break in traditions from earlier periods, in typology and morphology. While major differences are known and became greater as the Early Bronze Age progressed, the earliest phases show more than a modicum of continuity with Chalcolithic potting traditions. The Early Bronze Age  may now be divided up into three sequential phases, Early Bronze I, Early Bronze II and Early Bronze III. Some scholars include an Early Bronze IV in the Early Bronze Age. That period is known to other scholars as Middle Bronze I, Early Bronze-Middle Bronze and Intermediate Bronze. On the basis of pottery styles there is some justification for using the term Early Bronze IV. 

Early Bronze I (ca. 3500 - ca. 3000 BCE) pottery in the southern region is obviously derived from Chalcolithic traditions. Similar types of vessels are known and they were, in the earliest phases, made according to traditional Chalcolithic methods of manufacture. In the north there seems to be much less continuity, but that may be more of perception of the archaeological record. Unfortunately there is no good Chalcolithic sequence in the north from which one may learn precisely what the latest Chalcolithic facies is.
 
What is clear is that in the earliest phases of EB I there is a pronounced regionalism that becomes less visible over time. Regionalism is particularly marked in the earliest phase of Early Bronze I, with a dichotomy between northern and southern spheres of influence and a mosaic of more localized traditions within those larger spheres. In the southern region pie-crust type decoration is commonly found on large storage jars, while for the first time this type of detail is also found on holemouth vessels. The ledge handle becomes prominent in this period; its earliest exponents, obviously inherited from the preceding period, is notable for almost invariably having a wavy-line edge in many variations. Only rather late in the period and in specific regions was this appendage made with smooth edges. Poor preservation at most southern sites has limited knowledge of the typology of this early phase.

Pottery from the northern region fully recognized as Early Bronze I, shows less evidence of owing its inspiration to the preceding period. However, this may merely be a function of limited perception by researchers who fail to distinguish the pottery of what may be an initial phase of Early Bronze I. A slightly later phase is well known from a number of sites, the best known of which is [[Yiftahel|Yiftah'el]] in the [[Beit Netofa Valley]] system. The site has yielded a relatively large corpus of reasonably preserved vessels. The most distinctive pottery of this period is known as "Gray Burnished Ware" or sometimes as "Esdraelon Ware" or Proto-Urban C pottery. This ware is known for its generally gray color, highly burnished finish, and a limited and distinctive range of morphological types, almost invariably bowls. Most of the bowls have a carinated (angled) profile, some of them with flat projections forming an undulating line in a birds eye view. Similar morphological types are also found in red or in buff colors. Additional ceramic types have features that are reminiscent of Chalcolithic types. In addition the ledge handle is also prominent in this period. Pottery is always handmade and in the earliest phases appears to have been home-made by local potters working within general traditions of how a pot should look, but with little slavish copying. The high loop handle was popular in this period for jugs and [[juglet]]s.

A second phase of Early Bronze I may be seen in both the northern and southern regions. In the north much pottery is painted or slipped red and burnished. Gray Burnished Ware continues to be made but examples of this ware, in the earlier period finely made and obviously luxury items, are less well made. A related morphological type is a curved bowl with a line of evenly spaced conical protrusions just below the rim on the exterior of the vessel. Such bowls are also known to be red-slipped in the north; in the south similar types are very rare and neither slipped nor burnished. Grain-wash, a kind of painting that leave a pattern that is slightly reminiscent of wood (sometimes called band-slip) makes its appearance in this period in the north. [[Pithoi]] are of different types. Two well-known types are distinguished by their rims; one has a pronounced bow-rim, while the other has a thickened rim with regular striations that give it its name, 'rail rim'. In the south there remains a deal of regionality, stressed by two types of decorated wares which only slightly overlap in their distribution. They are 'line painted group', red lines usually on a light background. Within that group is a very distinctive 'basket style', that imitates basketry. This type was commonly found in the Hill Country around Jerusalem and down to [[Jericho]] and [[Bab edh-Dhra]] in the [[Jordan Rift Valley]]. Further south, in the [[Shephela]] (piedmont) down to the Northern Negev is found a group of pottery with distinctive striated handles, often double stranded, and sometimes with thin coils of clay wrapped horizontally around where the handles were attached to the vessel walls. Other generic types were made, including more standardized pithoi, often with a thick, whilt quick-lime type coating on their exteriors. These pithoi were commonly decorated with flat, thin strips of clay placed horizontally around the vessel in 1 or more bands and pressed flat at regular intervals so as to give the impression of a rope. 

It is in this period that there is a great increase of standardization within the larger spheres, northern and southern. While no center of pottery production has yet been found, there seems to be evidence for extensive trading of pottery between sites or possibly from a central point of production. Only extensive petrographic analyses can help to prove this and perhaps pinpoint some possible location for such centers.

By the third and final phase of Early Bronze I there remains a dichotomy between north and south, with red-burnishing as opposed to no burnishing and the extensive use of white, quick-lime slip reflecting northern and southern traditions, respectively. Extensive trade of ceramics, or possibly groups of itinerant potters seem to have left much evidence for their movement or that of pots between regions and within regions. Morphological types are shared from region to region and sphere to sphere, but often with localized details. All pottery from this period is handmade. Egyptian imported pottery if found in some sites in the south western region in this period. Most sites have only a small quantity, but a few select sites suggest prolonged contacts with [[Egyptians]] and possibly even Egyptians residing in the southern [[Levant]].

[[File:Kiberth k. ware.JPG|thumb|Khirbet Kerak ware, in a museum in Tel Aviv]]
Pottery of Early Bronze I in the north seems to presage that of Early Bronze II in terms of morphology and decoration (especially red painting and burnishing), although in the later period potters achieved similar types through very different technological approaches. Wheels seem to have come into use and new fabrics, better levigated (cleared of coarse materials) were made. So-called 'metallic ware' was introduced in this period. Some examples look as if they were imitating metal, while the high-fired fabrics give off a metallic-like ring when struck. Jugs, platters of this ware were found alongside others of more plain fabrics. 'Metallic Ware' was probably made somewhere in [[Lebanon]] or in the region of [[Mount Hermon]] and disseminated to the south, generally as far as the [[Jezreel Valley]]. Further south similar morphological types are known, but they are of different wares. Early Bronze III types continue the earlier tradition, but in the north a new ware type, transported from the [[Caucasus]] and probably brought overland via [[Anatolia]] and [[Syria]], makes its appearance. First discovered at [[Tel Bet Yerah]] on the [[Sea of Galilee|Kinneret]] ([[Khirbet Kerak]]), on the southern shores of the [[Sea of Galilee]] / Lake Kinneret (in which excavations the ware was first defined during the 1920s), it is called Khirbet Kerak Ware. 
[[File:Khirbet kerak ware.gif|thumb|Khirbet Kerak ware]]
It was obviously made by potters who brought the tradition with them. Examples are of highly distinctive types, jugse and jars, sometimes with fluting, painted and highly burnished red or black or a combination of these colors, andirons, some with decorations and faces, and carinated bowls. Khirbet Kerak Ware was always handmade. Khirbet Kerak Ware is also known as Red Black Burnished Ware (sometimes hyphenated "Red-Black") in west Syrian and [[Amuq Valley]] contexts. In [[Transcaucasia]] - from which area it seems ultimately to have originated - the ware is also referred to as Karaz or Pulur Ware.  As such, it may be associated with the later historic appearance of the people recognised historically as the [[Hurrians]].  [[Petrography|Petrographic analyses]] shows some of it was made locally. Other local traditions continue and eventually influenced the pottery of the Intermediate Age, which followed.

The [[potter's wheel]], used primarily for throwing small bowls using centrifugal force is known from this period. It represents an innovation that was continued in the following period, when it was employed to fashion rims for vessels of certain types. The piriform juglet makes its appearance in this period, but whether it has any connection with the later, Middle Bronze II vessels of analogous form, is unclear. With the exception of Khhirbet Kerak Ware, the pottery of this period continues the Early Bronze traditions and passed them on to the people who populated the small communities of the succeeding period.

==== Middle Bronze Age I (ca. 2300– ca. 2000 BC) ====
This period goes under a number of names: Early Bronze/Middle Bronze, Early Bronze IV and Intermediate Bronze are just some of the appellations given it. The pottery of the earliest phases has a clear 'Early Bronze flavor'. Some of the shapes of vessels and the details of them, e.g. flat bases and folded 'envelope-like' ledge handles indicate continuity of traditions. Indeed, recent evidence of Early Bronze III sites shows that certain forms made their appearance then and continued into Early Bronze IV or even later. The four-spouted lamp is one of these; another is the 'teapot' shape. 

There is a major dichotomy and great differences between the pottery of the northern and southern regions. Certain shapes are associated with particular fabric types which, can be related to one or the other region. The pottery of this period shows some innovations, including the use of the wheel for fashioning the rims of jars. In the south decoration was generally incisions, while painting was more common in the north. There are also regional variations with pottery from Transjordan somewhat different from that associated with areas west of the Jordan.

Unfortunately relatively few settlements have been dug from this period and most of the pottery known is derived from tombs. That is because most of the major population centers were deserted at the end of Early Bronze III and people tended to settle in much smaller communities. Probably because they had less resources and perhaps had to work harder to keep themselves, they left relatively scanty evidence of their permanent settlements. Once it was believed that most of the people of this period were semi-nomadic, but as time goes by more and more evidence of sedentism in this period is being found. In the north is found the first evidence of infiltration of Syrian type pottery in a group of so-called 'Megiddo teapots', small, delicate, wheel-made vessels of high-fired, dark, almost metallic fabric decorated with white, wavy lines. 

Sites have yielded evidence of local variations in decoration, morphology and fabrics. One such is the use of burnished red slips known from the cemetery at [[Bab edh-Dhra]]. In the [[Beth Shan]] region certain vessels have special painted decoration, while a cave near [[Tel Qedesh]] in Upper Galilee yielded many pedestaled lamps. Basically, the pottery of this period represents the last dying gasps of a tradition that reaches back into the local Chalcolithic (with even earlier antecedents) period and continuing on into the Early Bronze Age. There are, however, hints at the major changes to come in influences from the area to the north, Syria, which was to revolutionize ceramic traditions in the southern Levant for the next two millennia.

==== Middle Bronze Age (ca 2000– ca. 1550 BC) ====
Pottery of this period owes relatively little to local antecedents. It has its roots in more northerly regions, especially in the traditions of Syria, which in turn was in contact with Mesopotamian and Anatolian regions. The pottery of the full-blown Middle Bronze Age (Middle Bronze IIA, IIB and IIC) represents a revolutionary tradition for the southern Levant.

This period is divided into three different sub periods: MBII A, B, and C. We shall see that B and C are closer linked than A. This period is diagnosed by the well-burnished red slip so often seen in the corresponding layers at digs. The slip is normally used on the smaller vessels of the period. Other decorating techniques found to be frequent amongst this period's pottery are horizontal sometimes triangular designs in black or red paint.

The second half of this period (B+C) is not seen by the burnished red slip, which all but disappeared during the eighteenth century, replaced by white/creamy slip.  The pottery is often quite thinly walled and even kilned at high temperatures. Despite this, there is a progression of techniques from MBII A, which does denote continuity in society from then. Other noticeable traits of the period are a lack of painted design on most types of pottery and then only unicolored. The one color often tends to be stripes or circles with the odd bird making an appearance. These designs appear on ointment juglets.

The ointment juglet is the most important piece of pottery of the period. The fashion of juglets swings gradually from piriform ones to cylindrical. Amongst these vessels we find zoomorphic shapes like animals or human heads. These designs are often accompanied by “puncturing”, which used to be filled by white lime.

Lastly [[Chocolate on White Ware]] and [[Bichrome Ware]] are important pottery types appearing in the 16th century. The first of the two types consists of a thick white slip being applied followed by a dark brown paint. This type is found in the northern region of the country particularly close to the Jordan Valley. The Bichrome Ware the more important of the two can be found at [[Tall al-Ajjul|Tel el-Ajjul]] and [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] among others. Its “pendant” lines or stripes that come usually as black on white slip, or more commonly as red on black can help notice this type of pottery. Bichrome was imported from [[Cyprus]].

==== Late Bronze Age (1550–1200 BC) ====
Due to the influx of imported types of pottery, the pottery of this period must be divided into four sub groups:

===== Local Pottery =====
The local shows that there is a clear evolution of the pottery through the MB to this period. The difference that can be remarked between the two periods is that the juglets that were once of great dispersion go down in popularity and become gray as the Late Bronze Age begins. In fact the local pottery is now mass-produced in a rough and cheap manner.

Paint decoration returns to fashion, even though it is simply added to the light buff slip, and sometimes without slip. The paint shows many different geometric shapes, and sometimes inside painted on rectangular panels called metopes a sacred tree flanked by two antelopes can be found.

===== The Bichrome Group =====
Again in this period we can see that the majority of this group is red paint on black background. The most common vessels that we find this type in are kraters, jars and jugs. This group, after being tested with neutron activation techniques shows that it was imported from eastern Cyprus; this includes [[Cypriot Bichrome ware]]. The major controversy is whether the Cypriot market produced Canaanite styles for exporting purposes, or whether Canaanites were producing the pottery for the home consumption in Israel. This pottery was also to be found in Megiddo locally made.

===== Cypriot Imported Pottery =====
[[File:Late Bronze Period – Hecht Museum 006.JPG|thumb|Bilbil juglets - Late Bronze Period Pottery in [[Hecht Museum]], Haifa, Israel - Base Ring Ware; Late [[Bronze Age]] IIB ca. 1400-1200 BCE]]

This is a selection of handmade pottery in different Ware styles. These styles are called: Base Ring, White Slip, Monochrome, White Shaved, White Painted, [[Bucchero]]. Of these different kinds, Monochrome, White Slip, and Base Ring were most used. It appears as though this type of pottery was found to be decorative in nature rather than useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Charlesworth|first1=James H.|title=The Good And Evil Serpent: How a Universal Symbol Became Christianized|date=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300142730|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cJlmWuXCCecC&amp;pg=PA98|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Bilbil juglets" are an example of Base Ring Ware, which are pottery and have long slim necks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumsinisrael.gov.il/en/items/Pages/ItemCard.aspx?IdItem=ICMS_EIM_MHP98.60 Bilbil juglets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Novacek|first1=Gabrielle Vera|title=Ancient Israel: Highlights from the Collection of the Oriental Institute of  the University of Chicago|date=2011|publisher=Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago|isbn=9781885923653|page=32|url=https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/oimp31.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Archeologists speculate that bilbil juglets may have been used in the trade of [[opium]], due to traces of opiates found in some of the styles of the jugs, as well as the shape of the vessel resembling an upturned [[Papaver somniferum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chovanec|first1=Zuzana|last2=Bunimovitz|first2=Shlomo|last3=Lederman|first3=Zvi|title=Is There Opium Here? – Analysis of Cypriot Base Ring Juglets from Tel Beth-Shemesh, Israel|journal=Mediterranean Archaeology and Archaeometry|volume=15|issue=2|pages=175-189|url=http://maajournal.com/Issues/2015/Vol15-2/Full14.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Distribution of pottery Neolithic sites in southern Levant-fr.svg|alt=Southern Levant pottery distribution|thumb|Distribution of pottery Neolithic sites in Southern Levant]]

===== Mycenaean Imports =====
This pottery was produced on inland Greece and throughout the Aegean islands. The fabrication technique used was fast-wheel, with fine well-levigated clay. The slip was of a light cream color to give the background to the exquisite decoration normally done in dark-brown color. Vessel types were small and closed flasks or “stirrup jars”.  Towards the end of the Bronze Age there is evidence that Mycenaean [[Late Helladic IIIC]] pottery was being made by local potters from Canaanite clays.  Either this indicates a resident population of Mycenaean potters in the so-called [[Philistines|Philistine]] cities, or else it reflects an ethnic movement of new cultural elements into this region.

==== Iron Age I (1200–1000 BC) ====
Two new major pottery groups appear in Canaan at this time. They have been related to the settlement of the Philistines and Israelites.

===== Philistine Bichrome Ware =====
This is the descendant of the imported Mycenaean Ware of the past period, which is known also as Mycenaean IIIC1b. This new style of pottery is made locally. Neutron analysis proves that it could have even been made in the same workshop. It began at approximately the 12th century BC and began to disappear towards the end of the 11th century BC. The style is slightly influenced by Egypt but mostly by Canaanite. The Mycenaean tradition holds a firm grasp over the shape of the pottery (for example “stirrup jars”), whereas bottles are found to share Cypriot styles (seen by tall and narrow necks). The decoration of this new ware has changed to red and black paints on a whitish slip. Birds and fish are found to be common on Mycenaean IIIC1b but less on the new style, in fact by the second half of the 11th century the bird which was once thought to be sacred disappeared from the pottery.

===== Israelite Pottery =====
The new Israelite settlers began by using basic types of Canaanite pottery until they began developing simple copies of the purchased pottery so as to meet their needs. The hallmark of this early Israelite style is the pithoi. They are scattered over these sites. Many of the storage jars had The “Collared Rim”, which were most popular to the central part of Israel, although they have since also been found to also have been manufactured in areas outside of the Israelite settlement area.

==== Iron Age II (1000–586 BC) ====
During the period of the [[United Monarchy]], Israelite pottery improved.  Finishing techniques used a remarkable amount of red slip, applied by hand and smoothed with an irregular burnish. At the division of the kingdom, however, pottery styles broke into two separate traditions.

Samaria Ware is a general name given to the pottery of Israel (the northern kingdom), even though there is a wide variety of forms and styles. They can be put into two separate groups. The first is thick walled, with a high foot and red slip (sometimes burnished), most often shaped as bowls. The second is made of fine particled clay, and decorated with concentric stripes of red/yellowish colored slip.

Judean pottery is altogether different, and slowly progresses into more and more sophisticated types/styles. By the 8th/7th centuries BC, Jerusalem pottery was especially good. All over the southern kingdom, a technique known as “wheel burnish” was used.  This term describes how an orange/red slip was applied, while the pot was on the wheel, and then burnished to a gloss using the potter's hands or smooth tools.

===Classic period===
During the Roman and early Byzantine period, the Levant was on the edge of the enormous territories where [[ancient Roman pottery]] was produced and used, often being transported long distances by sea.  As in other areas, local traditions and mass-produced Roman styles co-existed, but the Levant never became a major centre producing wares for export, as the area of modern [[Tunisia]] did with its [[African red slip ware]], and modern Turkey with [[Phocaean red slip]], both often excavated in the Levant.  However, the Levant was a production centre for large blocks of bulk raw [[Roman glass]], which were shipped to various centres to be worked.

Common kitchen ware of the [[Galilee]] region was produced primarily in [[Kafr 'Inan]] (Kefar Hananya). One item produced there, the "Kefar Hananya I CE type," is also known as the "Galilean bowl."&lt;ref name=Neusnerp203&gt;Neusner et al., 2008, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; This coarse ware network was one of many sub-regional and micro-regional coarse and fine ware ceramic culture networks in operation in the Levant.&lt;ref name=Wickhamp773&gt;Wickhman, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?id=27R9QRfs8jMC&amp;pg=PA773&amp;dq=%22kefar+hananya%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22kefar%20hananya%22&amp;f=false p. 773].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===
====Arab period====
In exploring the similarities throughout the different eras, Macalister discusses Palestinian pottery in the [[Arab]] period and its shared characteristics with the ancient and modern pottery produced in Palestine.&lt;ref name=Macalister228&gt;Macalister, 1912, p. 228-231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Of the pottery from the Arab period, he notes: "...there seem to have been large globular jars, not unlike the Pre-[[Semitic people|Semitic]] and First Semitic barrel-shaped jars." He describes them as having "ledge-handles, though of a different shape from the early ledge-handles," and continues to write that, "... this kind of handle is still made in native pottery."&lt;ref name=Macalister228/&gt; Further, he notes that jar-covers from this period are strikingly similar to those of the "earliest type of ware," the "Second Semitic jar-covers, with two loops in the middle of the saucer."&lt;ref name=Macalister228/&gt; [[File:The Potter and Wheel, Jaffa, Palestine, 1859.jpg|thumb|left|185px|The Potter and Wheel, [[Jaffa]], in 1859. From Thomson, p. 282.]] The lamps produced during the Arab period are "either of the [[Hellenistic]] type, with long spout, or the [[Byzantine]] slipper form."&lt;ref name=Macalister228/&gt; The "Third Semitic lamp" which almost completely disappears during the Hellenistic period, comes into use once again during the Arab period and Macalister notes that it is still frequently used among the Arab inhabitants of Palestine.&lt;ref name=Macalister228/&gt;

Some of the linear decoration techniques also show a "startling resemblance to the painted ornament of the Second Semitic Period."&lt;ref name=Macalister228/&gt; Macalister notes that the major differences are that "The slip and the paint have a fatter, richer texture in the Arab ware than in the [[Amorite]], and the painted devices are more geometrical, more mechanical, and also more minute and 'finicking' in the later than in the earlier pottery."&lt;ref name=Macalister228/&gt; As for similarities with the Roman period, horizontal ribbing, a key characteristic of Roman era pottery, "is as common in this period as in the Roman, but it seems to differ in outline."&lt;ref name=Macalister228/&gt;

==Modern era==
Modern Palestinian pots, bowls, jugs and cups, particularly those produced prior to the establishment of [[Israel]] in 1948, are similar in shape, fabric and decoration to their ancient equivalents.&lt;ref name=Needler&gt;Needler, 1949, pp. 75-76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Winifred Needler]], Deputy Keeper of the [[Near Eastern]] Department at the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] of Archaeology writes in ''Palestine: Ancient and Modern'' (1949) that this continuity demonstrates "how persistently the potter's craft clung to tradition through the centuries."&lt;ref name=Needler/&gt; R.A. Stewart Macalister, in his work ''The Excavation of Gezer'' (1912), underlines this point prefacing his overview of Palestinian pottery throughout the ages by noting that: &lt;blockquote&gt;"... the division into periods [of Palestinian pottery] is to some extent a necessary evil, in that it suggests a misleading idea of discontinuity - as though the periods were so many water-tight compartments with fixed partitions between them. In point of fact, each period shades almost imperceptibly into the next."&lt;ref name=Macalister131&gt;Macalister, 1912, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting further on modern examples of Palestinian pottery, Needler notes that the clay used is of much the same composition as the ancient examples and is shaped, smoothed and baked in the same way, with the surfaces often decorated in similar painted, incised, or moulded techniques.&lt;ref name=Needler/&gt; "[[Ramallah]]" ware, a think-walled, pinkish drab pottery painted with simple geometric and plant designs in red, is handmade; as are the "frying pan" and the home-made braziers. Other pottery is wheel-made, largely undecorated, but often with a glossy black glaze and crude designs in bright red.&lt;ref name=Needler/&gt;

The Palestinian Association for Cultural Exchange (PACE) has put together a collection of traditional pottery, including cooking pots, jugs, mugs and plates that are manufactured by men and women from historic villages like [[Jib (village)|al-Jib]] ([[Gibeon (ancient city)|Gibeon]]), [[Beitin]] ([[Bethel]]) and [[Senjel]]. They are handmade and fired in open, charcoal-fueled kilns as in ancient times.&lt;ref name=PACE&gt;{{cite web|title=PACE's Exhibit of Traditional Palestinian Handicrafts|publisher=PACE|accessdate=2007-07-13|url=http://www.pace.ps/handi/handi.html |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070603233539/http://www.pace.ps/handi/handi.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian ceramics are produced at traditional family-owned factories in [[Hebron]] and other cities. Covering a wide range of colorful hand-painted plates, vases, hanging ornaments, tiles, cups, jars and framed mirrors, the ceramics are known for the intricate detail of their flower and arabesque patterns.&lt;ref name=PACE/&gt;

[[Palestinian art]]ists who produce contemporary clay sculpture, like [[Vera Tamari]] from Ramallah, have incorporated the clay [[potsherd|shards]] from ancient pieces into their work. Says Tamari,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"My own artwork is inspired by seeing the history in Palestinian land. For a time, I used a lot of shards of pottery as a theme in my clay work. You find shards of pottery everywhere because Palestine has had so many thousand of years of history that you walk on a hill and you just find these little pieces of pottery that are evidence of life that was there — pieces of jars, of plates, of bowls."&lt;ref name=MotherJones&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview: Vera Tamari|publisher=Mother Jones Magazine|date=11 May 2005|accessdate=2007-07-13|url=https://www.motherjones.com/arts/feature/2005/05/vera_tamari.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dina Ghazal]] from [[Nablus]] use another approach, believing that abstraction will best express the essence of her ideas.
The qualities of the material she works with are very important for Ghazal,  she explains that her work is an attempt to show the versatility  of the medium and she hopes to challenge traditional perceptions of the use of the clay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sakakini.org/visualarts/dina_ghazal.htm Dina Ghazzal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130044812/http://www.sakakini.org/visualarts/dina_ghazal.htm |date=2008-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shape note]]s are a system of music notation designed to facilitate choral singing. Shape notes of various kinds have been used for over two centuries in a variety of sacred choral music traditions practiced primarily in the Southern region of the United States.

"Shape-note singers used [[tune book]]s rather than [[hymnal]]s. Hymnals were pocket-size books with texts only. Tune books were large oblong-shaped books with hard covers (nine inches by six inches was a typical size), often running to over four hundred pages. They included both music and text and were introduced by an extended essay on the rudiments of singing. Each song was known by the name given to its tune rather than by a title drawn from the text."&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Steve and Collins, Judy (2003). ''Amazing Grace: The Story of America's Most Beloved Song'', p.118. {{ISBN|978-0-06-000219-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following is a '''partial list of the shape note tunebooks''' published over the last two centuries.  The list is divided according to the two main systems of shape notes—four-shape vs. seven-shape—and within these two categories is sorted chronologically.

'''''Lobster Trap and Fish Tail''''', a [[mobile (sculpture)|mobile]] by [[United States|American]] artist [[Alexander Calder]], is located at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]. It is one of Calder's earliest hanging mobiles and "the first to reveal the basic characteristics of the genre that launched his enormous international reputation and popularity."&lt;ref name="lipman"&gt;Lipman, Jean; Franc, Helen Margaret (1976). ''Bright stars: American painting and sculpture since 1776.'' Dutton, {{ISBN|978-0-525-07147-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture was commissioned by the Advisory Committee for the stairwell of the museum when the new building opened in 1939.&lt;ref name="morgan"&gt;Morgan, Ann Lee (2007). ''The Oxford dictionary of American art and artists, '' p. 73. Oxford University Press US, {{ISBN|978-0-19-512878-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fabricated in [[Roxbury, Connecticut]], the painted steel wire and sheet aluminum sculpture is 8' 6" (260 cm) x 9' 6" (290 cm) in diameter. The sculpture suggests the movement of underwater life.&lt;ref name="moyle"&gt;Moyle, Peter B.; Moyle, Marilyn A. (1992). Fish imagery in art 28: Calder's ''Lobster Trap and Fish Tail''. ''Environmental Biology of Fishes'',  Volume 35, Number 2, 204 {{doi|10.1007/BF00002194}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Calder became a leading exponent of [[kinetic art]], combining his engineering training with his studies of art in New York and Paris. According to a review in the ''[[New York Sun]]'', "There, he became enthralled with the [[biomorphic]] [[surrealism]] of [[Joan Miró]] as well as the powerful [[choreography]] of [[modern dance]] pioneer [[Martha Graham]]."&lt;ref name=finkelstein&gt;Finkelstein, Allix (September 28, 2007). [http://www.nysun.com/arts/intimate-at-moma/63563/ Intimate at MoMA.] ''[[New York Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt; After experimenting with motorized sculptures, Calder began creating works that moved and floated when touched or exposed to air currents. Calder composed motion with works like ''Lobster Trap and Fish Tail'', "harnessing the performative potential of the mechanical sciences."&lt;ref name=finkelstein/&gt;

The '''manticore''' ([[Middle Persian|Early Middle Persian]] ''Merthykhuwar'') modern persian ("Mardykhor") is a Persian [[legendary creature]] similar to the Egyptian [[sphinx]] that proliferated in western European medieval art as well. It has the head of a human, body of a [[lion]] and a tail of venomous spines similar to [[porcupine]] quills, while other depictions have it with the tail of a [[scorpion]]. There are some accounts that the spines can be shot like arrows, thus making the manticore a lethal predator. It eats its victims whole, using its triple rows of teeth, and leaves no bones behind.

The '''mantyger''' is a creature of medieval invention, having the body of a [[Tyger (heraldry)|heraldic tiger]] with mane, and the head of an old man, the tusks of a boar and with long spiral horns.{{CN|date=June 2018}} Some heraldic authorities make the horns more like those of an ox, and the hands and feet like a monkey's.

==Origin==
The Manticore myth was of Persian origin, where its name was "man-eater" (from [[Persian language|early Middle Persian]] مارتیا ''mardya'' "man" (as in human) and خوار ''khowr-'' "to eat"). The English term "manticore" was borrowed from Latin ''mantichora'', itself derived from the Greek rendering of the Persian name, {{lang|grc|μαρτιχώρα}}, ''martichora''. It passed into European folklore first through a remark by [[Ctesias]], a Greek physician at the Persian court of King [[Artaxerxes II of Persia|Artaxerxes II]] in the fourth century BC, in his book [[Indica (Ctesias)|''Indica'']] ("India"), which circulated among Greek writers on natural history but has survived only in fragments, or references by those other writers. The Romanised Greek [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], in his ''[[Description of Greece]]'', recalled strange animals he had seen at Rome and commented,

{{quote|The beast described by Ctesias in his Indian history, which he says is called '''martichoras''' by the Indians and "man-eater" [''androphagos''] by the Greeks, I am inclined to think is the [[tiger]]. But that it has three rows of teeth along each jaw and spikes at the tip of its tail with which it defends itself at close quarters, while it hurls them like an archer's arrows at more distant enemies; all this is, I think, a false story that the Indians pass on from one to another owing to their excessive dread of the beast. (''Description'', 9.21.4)}}

[[Pliny the Elder]] did not share Pausanias' skepticism. He followed [[Aristotle]]'s natural history by including the ''martichoras'' – mistranscribed as ''manticorus'' in his copy of Aristotle – among his descriptions of animals in ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' 8:30, c. 77 AD.

Later, in ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' Greek writer [[Flavius Philostratus]] (c. 170–247) wrote:

{{quote|And inasmuch as the following conversation also has been recorded by Damis as having been held upon this occasion with regard to the mythological animals and fountains and men met with in India, I must not leave it out, for there is much to be gained by neither believing nor yet disbelieving everything. Accordingly Apollonius asked the question, whether there was there an animal called the man-eater (''martichoras''); and Iarchas replied: "And what have you heard about the make of this animal? For it is probable that there is some account given of its shape." "There are," replied Apollonius, "tall stories current which I cannot believe; for they say that the creature has four feet, and that his head resembles that of a man, but that in size it is comparable to a lion; while the tail of this animal puts out hairs a cubit long and sharp as thorns, which it shoots like arrows at those who hunt it."&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', translated by F. C. Conybeare, volume I, book III. Chapter XLV, pp. 327–329.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings.jpeg|thumb|right|Manticore or mantyger badge of [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings|William, Lord Hastings]], c.1470. This version has tusks.]]

==Medieval and post-medieval appearances==
Pliny's book was widely enjoyed and uncritically believed through the European Middle Ages, during which the manticore was sometimes described or illustrated in [[Bestiary|bestiaries]]. Through [[false etymology]], it was sometimes assumed that the name was an amalgamation of ''man'' and ''[[tiger]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|manticore}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources regarded the ''mantyger'' as a different creature entirely (the mantyger having monkey-like feet, being apparently inspired by the [[baboon]]; and also sometimes being represented with either tusks or short horns).&lt;ref&gt;Dennys 1975, pp. 114–7&lt;/ref&gt; There was further confusion as to whether the manticore should be identified with or distinguished from the ''satyral'' and the [[lampago]].&lt;ref name="Dennys 1975, p. 114"&gt;Dennys 1975, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dante Alighieri]], in his ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', depicted the mythical creature [[Geryon]] as a manticore, following Pliny's description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/divina-commedia-di-dante-alighieri/oclc/1026178|title=La Divina commedia di Dante Alighieri,|last=Dante Alighieri|last2=Grandgent|first2=C.

Heath and Co.|location=Boston; New York|language=Italian|quote=Dante's image was profoundly modified, however, by Pliny's description---followed by Solinus---of a strange beast called Mantichora (''Historia Naturalis'', VIII, 30) which has the face of a man, the body of a lion, and a tail ending in a sting like a scorpion's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manticore or mantyger first appeared in English heraldry in c.1470, as a badge of [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings]]; and in the 16th century it was used as a badge by [[Robert Radcliffe, 1st Earl of Sussex]], and by Sir [[Anthony Babyngton]].&lt;ref&gt;Dennys 1975, pp. 115–6.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Randle Holme#Randle Holme III (1627–1700)|Randle Holme]] in 1688 described the manticore (which he regarded as distinct from the mantyger) as having
:the face of a man, the mouth open to the ears with a treble row of teeth beneath and above; long neck, whose greatness, roughness, body and feet are like a Lyon: of a red colour, his tail like the tail of a Scorpion of the Earth, the end armed with a sting, casting forth sharp pointed quills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Randle |last=Holme |authorlink=Randle Holme#Randle Holme III (1627–1700) |title=The Academy of Armorie and Blazon |place=Chester |year=1688 |page=212 }}; quoted in Dennys 1975, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The heraldic manticore influenced some [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] representations of the sin of Fraud, conceived as a monstrous [[chimera (mythology)|chimera]] with a beautiful woman's face – for example, in [[Bronzino]]'s allegory, "[[Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time]]" ([[National Gallery]], London),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John F. |last=Moffitt |title=An Exemplary Humanist Hybrid: Vasari's "Fraude" with Reference to Bronzino's "Sphinx" |journal=Renaissance Quarterly |volume=49 |issue=2 |year=1996 |pages=303–333 |doi=10.2307/2863160}} traces the chimeric image of Fraud backwards from Bronzino.&lt;/ref&gt; and more commonly in the decorative schemes called "[[Grotesque|grotteschi]]". From here it passed by way of [[Cesare Ripa]]'s ''Iconologia'' into the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century French conception of a [[sphinx]].

[[Gerald Brenan]] linked the manticore to the ''[[mantequero]]'', a monster feeding on [[human fat]] in [[Andalusian folklore]].&lt;ref name="Brenan"&gt;''Al Sur de Granada'', pages 190-193, [[Gerald Brenan]], 1997, Fábula - Tusquets Editores. Originally ''[[South from Granada (book)|South from Granada]]'', 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
{{Main|Manticore (disambiguation)}}
The manticore has been mentioned in ''Harry Potter'' novels and in the book ''Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them''. However, it was introduced as a Greek monster by mistake.

In Emerson Lake and Palmer's 18 minute album, Tarkus, the 5th piece, Manticore, tells a tell of an armadillo who wants to conquer Earth and go through many trials, and in this piece, it is battling a Manticore.

[[File:Marzocco.jpg|thumb|The ''Marzocco'' now in [[Piazza della Signoria]], a replica of Donatello's]]  [The term "Marzocco"; unfathomable to some scholars,  by many accounts deontes from the Latin word: "Marte" or Mars, which in Medieval times, was considered the Roman God of War.]
The '''''Marzocco'''''  is the [[lion (heraldry)|heraldic lion]] that is a symbol of [[Florence]], and was apparently the first piece of public secular sculpture commissioned by the [[Republic of Florence]], in the late 14th century.  It stood at the heart of the city in the [[Piazza della Signoria]] at the end of the platform attached to the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] called the ''ringhiera'', from which speakers traditionally harangued the crowd.  This is now lost, having weathered with time to an unrecognizable mass of stone.

The best known rendition is by [[Donatello]], made in 1418&amp;ndash;20.  Donatello’s ''Marzocco'' was placed in the Piazza della Signoria in 1812, but in 1885 it was moved to the [[Bargello]], having been replaced by the copy we see to this day.

==The first Marzocco==
[[File:Domenico Ghirlandaio - Confirmation of the Rule (detail) - WGA08808.jpg|thumb|left|[[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], ''Confirmation of the Rule'' (detail) - the original ''Marzocco'' can be seen on the corner of the palazzo in the background at left, 1480s.]]
The original that had stood since (perhaps) 1377, and is now lost, appears to have been similar to Donatello's in design, though it was fully [[gilding|gilded]] and may have crouched over a submissive wolf representing Florence's great rival [[Siena]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/users/node/15256 Victoria and Albert Museum], page on their replica of the Donatello&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be seen in the background of several paintings and prints, though by the time it was replaced it was so worn that (being only medieval, not classical) it was not considered worth keeping, and disappeared.  About 1460 it was given a richly sculptural [[Socle (architecture)|socle]] with double [[baluster]]-like motifs&lt;ref&gt;"Resembling pairs of handleless ''all'antica'' urns arranged like the bulbs of a Roman [[candelabrum]]", according to Paul Davies and David Hemsoll, "Renaissance Balusters and the Antique" ''Architectural History'' '''26''' (1983:1&amp;ndash;122)  p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; at the corners.  The ''ringhiera'', once a platform from which the ''Signoria'' addressed the people, then a focus for popular tumult, was removed at the same time as the statue was replaced by Donatello's on a pedestal in 1812.

===Name===
The obscure name ''Marzocco'', unfathomable to some scholars, would by others derive from ''Marte'' ([[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]), whose Roman statue, was known as the "Roman God of War";  noted by Dante&lt;ref&gt;Dante,''Inferno'' XIII.146f, ''Purgatorio'' XXXI.58f.&lt;/ref&gt; and carried away by a flood of the [[Arno]] in 1333, had previously been Florence’s emblem.&lt;ref&gt;Lo Zingarelli 2008: ''Vocabolario della lingua italiana,'' Zanichelli (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; The lion is seated and with one paw supports the coat-of-arms of Florence, the [[fleur de lys]] called ''il giglio'', the lily. ''Marzocco'' was` invoked in the Florentine [[battle cry]] and figures in Gentile Aretino's poem "Alla battaglia":
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[[Saint George|San Giorgio]],&lt;ref&gt;The war cry of the [[Republic of Genoa]], which had Saint George as its patron.&lt;/ref&gt; Marzoccho&lt;!--Marzoccho in original--&gt; Marzoccho&lt;br&gt;
suona percuoti, forbocta rintoccho&lt;br&gt;
Palle palle,&lt;ref&gt;The ''palle'' or balls of the [[Medici]] coat-of-arms.&lt;/ref&gt; Marzoccho Marzoccho&lt;br&gt;
legagli strecti e pon lor buona taglia!"&lt;ref&gt;"Sound the trumpets! beat the drums! ...Bind them fast and hold them to a good ransom:" discussed and printed by Timothy J. McGee, "'Alla Battaglia': Music and Ceremony in Fifteenth-Century Florence" ''Journal of the American Musicological Society'' '''36'''.2 (Summer 1983:287&amp;ndash;302).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Tuscany6.jpg|thumb|220px|The ''Marzocco'' was crowned on [[Postage stamps and postal history of Tuscany|Tuscany's first postage stamp]], 1851.]]

===Symbol===
The ''Marzocco'' was such a powerful symbol of the [[Republic of Florence|Florentine Republic]] that the republican Florentine troops in the  [[Siege of Florence (1529&amp;ndash;1530)]] were known as ''marzoccheschi'', "sons of the Marzocco",&lt;ref&gt;Noted in Ulysse Robert, ''Philibert de Chalon, prince d'Orange, vice-roi de Naples'' (Paris: Plon-Nourrit) 1902:374; [[Benedetto Varchi]], ''Storia fiorentina'' xlv remarks upon a severe skirmish with them, "una piuttosto battaglia che scaramuccia co'Marzoccheschi".&lt;/ref&gt; and pro-Medici besiegers of the city in 1530 held a funeral and ritually buried a representation of it, with bells tolling.&lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Trexler, ''Public Life in Renaissance Florence'' (Academic Press) 1980, p. 4 note 9, drawing upon [[Benedetto Varchi]] xi.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prisoners of war from [[Pisa]] were forced to kiss it in 1364.&lt;ref&gt;"A still earlier ''Marzocco'' stood on this site, which the Pisan captives were forced ignominiously to kiss in 1364. The origin of the name Marzocco is unknown." Augustus Hare, ''Florence'' ([http://www.florin.ms/hareintro.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt;
At [[Anghiari]], subject to Florence from 1385, the 15th-century Palazzo del Marzocco faces the church; at [[Montepulciano]] stands the ''Marzocco'' column; at [[Volterra]] the ''Marzocco'' stands against the Palazzo dei Priori, seat of government; at [[Livorno]] the 15th-century ''Torre del Marzocco'' (''illustration, right'') guards the harbor entrance; and at [[Pietrasanta]] there are a 16th-century ''Marzocco'' fountain and the ''Marzocco'' column, erected in 1513 when [[Pope Leo X]] awarded the commune to Florence.
[[File:Torre del Marzocco.jpg|thumb|220px|The ''Torre del Marzocco'' in [[Livorno]].]]
In the subjected territory of Pisa, when [[Charles VIII of France]] entered Sarzana in 1494, the Pisans took the ''Marzocco'', emblem of their subjugation to Florence, and cast it into the Arno.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica'' 1911, ''s.v.'' "Pisa"&lt;/ref&gt; Live lions were kept at the commune's expense from the Middle Ages until they were banished in 1771.

At times the ''Marzocco'' would be crowned according to a motto by the writer of [[Novella|novelle]]'' [[Franco Sacchetti]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Corona porto, per la patria degna,&lt;br&gt;
Acciochè libertà ciascun mantegna."&lt;ref&gt;"I wear a crown worthy of my country, in order that everyone might maintain liberty", according to the translation in Susan and Joanne Horner, ''Walks in Florence: Churches, Streets and Palaces'' London, Henry S. King &amp; Co., 1877 ([http://www.florin.ms/hwalks15.html on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Donatello's==
Donatello's ''Marzocco'' was commissioned by the Republic of Florence for the apartment of [[Pope Martin V]] at [[Santa Maria Novella]], where this traditional ''insegna'' of communal republican defense&lt;ref&gt;Deliberations on the placement of the comparably Cock symbolic [[David (Michelangelo)|Michelangelo's ''David'']] included suggestions that it displace the ''Marzocco'', to be shifted to the doorway of [[Palazzo della Signoria]]: see Saul Levine, "The Location of Michelangelo's David: The Meeting of January 25, 1504" ''The Art Bulletin'' '''56'''.1 (March 1974:31&amp;ndash;49) especially p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; stood guard atop a column at the foot of the stairs that led to the ''sale del papa'' ("Papal apartments") in the convent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wga.hu/frames-e.html?/html/d/donatell/1_early/2marzocc.html Donatello's original ''Marzocco'']&lt;/ref&gt;  It is sculpted in the fine-grained gray sandstone of Tuscany called ''pietra serena''.  The Pope lingered at Florence after leaving the [[Council of Constance]] during the [[Western Schism]]. This staircase was demolished, perhaps by 1515.&lt;ref&gt;V&amp;A&lt;/ref&gt;

The Donatello ''Marzocco'' was moved to the [[Piazza della Signoria]] in 1812,&lt;ref&gt;Touring Club Italiano, ''Firenze e dintorni'' (Milan) 1964 pp. 116, 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

==After 1812==
A crowned ''Marzocco'', emphasizing the sovereign independence of [[Tuscany]], appears on [[Postage stamps and postal history of Tuscany|Tuscany's first issue of postage stamps]], 1851.

''Il Marzocco'' was adopted for the name of a progressive weekly literary review in broadsheet format published in Florence in 1896&amp;ndash;1932.

==History==
The Nationality Room Program was founded by [[Ruth Crawford Mitchell]] at the request of Pitt [[John Gabbert Bowman|Chancellor John Bowman]] in 1926 in order to involve the community as much as he could in constructing the [[Cathedral of Learning]] and to provide the spiritual and symbolic foundation of the Cathedral that what would make the inside of the building as inspiring and impressive as the outside. Under Mitchell's direction, invitations were extended to the nationality communities that made up the Pittsburgh area to provide a room that was representative of their heritage. Each group had to form a Room Committee, which would be responsible for all fundraising, designing, and acquisition. The University provided the room and upkeep in perpetuity once completed, while all other materials, labor, and design were provided by the individual committees. These were sometimes partly provided for by foreign governments which, "...responded with generous support, often providing architects, artists, materials, and monetary gifts to assure authenticity and superb quality in their classrooms."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/pages/about_nr.html |title=The Nationality Rooms: about nationality rooms |publisher=Pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028112138/http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/pages/about_nr.html |archivedate=2012-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each room's detail is carefully designed and executed down to the switch plates, door handles, hinges, and wastebaskets. The work is often performed and designed by native artists and craftsmen and involves imported artifacts and materials.  Mitchell remained Director of the Nationality Rooms program until 1956, having overseen the creation of the first 19 rooms on the first floor of the Cathedral.  A successor to Mitchell wasn't named until 1965, when current Director E. Maxine Bruhns took over the program, overseeing the completion (so far) of eight additional rooms on the third floor.

A typical room on the 1st floor (those built between 1938 and 1957) took between three and ten years to complete, and would have cost the equivalent of ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|300000|2006|r=0}}}} USD today, which was no small undertaking, especially considering that the fundraising and construction of the initial rooms took place during the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]].  More recent rooms have cost in the range of $750,000 USD and up and taken up to ten years to complete.&lt;ref name=plannedrooms&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2015/06/17/Other-Nationality-Rooms-in-the-works/stories/201506170002|title=Other Nationality Rooms in the works|first=Caelin|last=Miltko|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 21, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150620025447/http://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2015/06/17/Other-Nationality-Rooms-in-the-works/stories/201506170002|archivedate=June 20, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon completion of their rooms, the committees turn to a program of intercultural exchange and fundraising for nationality rooms scholarships which enable University of Pittsburgh students and faculty to study abroad.  The room committees also sponsor cultural and fundraising events, lectures, concerts, exhibits, social events, and workshops on ethnic studies that may utilize the rooms.  The committee may use its room for non-political meetings, lectures, or other functions if no classes are scheduled. Distinguished international visitors are received by the committees, and special projects are undertaken including the purchase of books for the [[Hillman Library|University libraries]], publication of volumes on topics from comparative literature to ethnic recipes, and the fostering of courses in the mother languages.  National, traditional, and religious holidays are celebrated on campus, and committees decorate their rooms or mount displays to commemorate special occasions.

Original plans also proposed, in addition to the Nationality Rooms on the first floor, the creation of "[[Pennsylvania]]" classrooms on the second floor to be dedicated to the pioneering groups within the state along with third floor "Pittsburgh" classrooms dedicated to showcasing the history of the [[Western Pennsylvania]] or different eras of American history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;q1=Classrooms;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a429842m;didno=00a429842m;view=image;seq=0032;node=00a429842m%3A14 |title=Nationality Rooms in the Cathedral of Learning |pages=30, 1933 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |accessdate=2008-08-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819190641/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;q1=Classrooms;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a429842m;didno=00a429842m;view=image;seq=0032;node=00a429842m:14 |archivedate=2012-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Scottish%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;node=00a872842m%3A5;view=image;seq=0047 |title=Classrooms in the Cathedral of Learning |pages=19, 1944? |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the plans for the series of rooms were drawn up, only one room was installed, the [[Nationality Rooms#Early American|Early American]] Classroom, which is now counted among the other Nationality Rooms. The plans for the other Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania rooms were never executed, and the Nationality Room program grew to occupy all of the first and much of the third floor.

[[File:English Room - Pitt - IMG 0501.jpg|thumb|right|The English Classroom, the largest of the 30 Nationality Rooms, contains several artifacts from the original second [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]]]
Upon completion of a room, a dedication ceremony is held in which a formal presentation of a ceremonial key is presented to the University's Chancellor in order to symbolize the bestowal and acceptance of the gift with a commitment on behalf of the University to maintain the room in perpetuity. The particular nationality room committee's officers then become active members of the Nationality Council which focuses on providing summer study abroad scholarships for Pitt students along with other non-political cultural or educational events within the Nationality Program's scope. Today the Cathedral is home to 30 Nationality Rooms (28 working classrooms and two display rooms: the [[Nationality Rooms#Early American|Early American]] Room and the [[Syria-Lebanon Room|Syrian-Lebanon]] Room), on the first and third floors. Each nationality room is designed to celebrate a different culture that had an influence on Pittsburgh's growth, depicting an era prior to 1787, the University's founding and the signing of the [[United States Constitution]]. Only one room does not follow this convention, with the [[Nationality Rooms#French|French]] Classroom depicting the French Empire period of the early 19th century. There are currently seven additional rooms in the process of being approved and funded.

Set in the Cathedral of Learning's cornerstone in 1937 is a gift from the Nationality Room Committee chairpersons to the University: a copper plate engraved with these thoughts:

:''Faith and peace are in their hearts. Good will has brought them together. Like the [[Magi]] of ancestral traditions and the shepherds of candid simplicity, they offer their gifts of what is precious, genuine and their own, to truth that shines forever and enlightens all people.''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Since 1944, tours of the nationality rooms have been given to visitors by a Pitt student organization, [[Quo Vadis]] (meaning ''Where do you go?''); they guide over 40,000 tourists a year. With reservations, specially themed tours based on creature symbolism, images of royalty, and folktales are also given. An estimated 100,000 visitors, including self-guided and walk-in tourists, visit the Nationality Rooms each year.

==Principles==
[[File:Indianroom2.jpg|thumb|The Indian Classroom, opened in 2000, is one of the newer Nationality Rooms that continue to be installed on the third floor]]
The following principles, in order to assure commonality of purpose, authenticity, and non-political cultural emphasis, governed the creation of nationality rooms from the programs inception in 1926 until the completion of the Irish Classroom in 1957.
*A Nationality Room must illustrate one of the outstanding architectural or design traditions of a nation that is recognized as such by the [[United States Department of State]].
*The design of a given historical period must be cultural and aesthetic, not political.  The period depicted should be prior to 1787, the year the University was founded.
*To avoid political implications in the room, no political symbol is permitted in the decorations, nor a portrait or likeness of any living person.
*The only place a political symbol may be used is in the corridor stone above the room's entrance.
*No donor recognition may appear in the rooms. Donor recognition to the rooms is recorded in a Donor Book.
*Most architects and designers of the rooms have been born and educated abroad.  This has been instrumental in ensuring authenticity of design.

In the 1970s, policy revisions  were implemented which retaining most of the earlier principles, utilized a broader definition of nation to include a body of people associated with a particular territory and possessing a distinctive cultural and social way of life.  This allowed the creation of the Armenian and Ukrainian rooms prior to their establishment as independent nations following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]], as well as allowing for the installation of the African Heritage Room.

The room must also be a functional teaching classroom with enough student tablet-armed seats, professor's lectern or table, adequate sight lines and lighting, modern audiovisual technology, and other necessities of a classroom.  New rooms also have narrated tour equipment. Materials are to remain authentic and durable  that are executed through architectural form and not mere surface embellishment and are to provide eternal qualities that have the potential to "teach" about the cultures  with appropriate non-political symbols and artifacts.

The [[Africa]]n Heritage Classroom was designed to reflect an 18th-century [[Ashanti people|Asante]] temple courtyard in [[Ghana]] which would provide the setting for ceremonial events, learning, and worship.  The classroom represents the entire continent of Africa with [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]]-style door carvings by Nigerian sculptor Lamidi O. Fakeye depicting ancient kingdoms of Africa including [[Egypt]], [[Nubia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Benin]], [[Kingdom of Kongo|Kongo]]/[[Angola]], [[Kuba Kingdom|Kuba]], [[Mali]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. Plaster forms in the [[frieze]] represent the arts, music, science, languages, and literature of Africa. A [[display case]] housing artifacts from various African nations and the chalkboard area reflect [[patos]] around the courtyard. Below the chalkboard doors depicting the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lozenge and star motif are [[Sankofa]] birds which symbolize the need to learn from the past in order to prepare for the future.  The oxblood steps, two levels of student benches, and [[wainscot]] with relief decorations suggest the polished clay of an Asante temple.  Openwork screens are present on the windows as they are used in Asante structures to filter the sun's rays while allowing air flow.  Six chieftain stools provide informal seating near a hand-carved professor's lectern.

The design consists of intersecting arches and a domed ceiling built to lessen damage from frequent earthquakes in that country. The room's arches, built of Indiana limestone, make this the heaviest of the Nationality Rooms, weighing 22 tons, and required the second floor beneath the room to be reinforced in order to support its weight. The cornerstone is a [[basalt]] stone from the grounds of Sanahin. In the mortar behind it are the thumbprints of five of the oldest Armenian [[diaspora]] living in the Pittsburgh area, as well as the handprint of an infant of Armenian descent, symbolizing the continuity of the Armenian presence in western Pennsylvania.

The [[Austria]]n Nationality Room represents the 18th-century era of the Austrian Empire during its age of enlightenment under Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] and her son [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] and incorporates [[Baroque]] elements of the [[Schloss Esterházy#The Haydnsaal|Haydnsaal]] in [[Schloss Esterházy]] at [[Eisenstadt]] where [[Joseph Haydn]] served as [[Kapellmeister]] from 1766 to 1778.  Ceiling paintings depict scenes from Roman mythology similar to those in the Haydnsaal.  The room features Lobmeyer crystal chandeliers, gilded white lacquer seminar furniture patterned after that in the formal dining hall of [[Vienna|Vienna's]] [[Hofburg]], royal red-tapestried walls, gold-leafed [[pilasters]], and a parquet floor inlaid in a starburst design. Exhibits in the display cases in the room trace the development of the multinational [[Austrian Empire]] and the birthplaces of representative Austrian composers born within its borders between the years 1000 and 1918.

The [[China|Chinese]] Classroom is inspired by the design of a palace hall in [[Beijing|Beijing's]] [[Forbidden City]] and is dedicated to the memory of [[Confucius]] and his democratic ideal of classless education. The teacher and students sit at the same level around a moon-shaped teakwood table.  The professor's chair is carved with the admonition to "Teach by inspiring gradually and steadily". A slate portrait of Confucius is present that is patterned after one in the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|Confucian temple]] at his birthplace of [[Qufu]] in [[Shandong]] [[Province (China)|Province]].  Above the red lacquered door, Chinese characters are carved into the stone lintel that proclaim that "Humility of mind goes with loftiness of character." Stone lions flank the entrance before carvings of the plum blossom, the national flower of China. The ceiling contains a coiling golden five-clawed imperial dragon surrounded by clouds denoting nature's energy and freedom.  Painted squares portray dragons guarding the pearl of wisdom and the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] with the motan flower, a symbol of cultural wealth.  The opened blackboard doors reveal painted renditions of the babao, or [[Eight Treasures]], popular in [[Chinese art]].  On the base below is a carved version of the [[Bagua (concept)|Bagua]] which consists of eight trigrams surrounding the circular [[Yin and Yang]].

The [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] Classroom combines elements of a [[Slovaks|Slovak]] farmhouse, country church, and the [[Charles University in Prague]] while detailing men who contributed to Czechoslovak culture. The motto of the classroom, and of the former [[Czechoslovak government in exile]], is proclaimed by the inscription of "Pravda Vítězí" which translates to "Truth Will Prevail" and surrounds a bronze relief portrait of the first President and founder of Czechoslovakia [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]].  In a wrought-iron case near the window bay, a letter penned by the hand of Masaryk to students at the University of Pittsburgh recalls [[John Amos Comenius|John Amos Comenius']] belief that "education is the workshop of humanity".  All woodwork, except the furniture, is made of [[larch]] wood which grows to great heights in the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. The ceiling, with flat boards overlapping each other between heavy beams, is painted by [[Prague]] artists Karel and Marie Svolinsky and depicts botanically accurate flowers and plants of Czechoslovakia and reflects a typical Slovak farmer's home and the style of country churches.  A "tree of life" design on the rear wall surrounds the text of the proclamation by King of [[Bohemia]] and Emperor of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] that marked the founding of the University of Prague in 1348.   The plaster reveals of the bay window area is decorated by murals of miraculous trees bearing flowers and fruits and harboring animals, birds, and insects reflecting "peasant writings" and executed by the artists in freehand.  Ceiling panels portray eight famous persons in [[Czechs|Czech]] and Slovak history from the 9th through 19th centuries including [[Cyril and Methodius]] who created the [[Cyrillic script]], [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Waclaw]] who was the "[[Good King Wenceslaus]]" of the [[Christmas Carol]], [[Jan Hus]] who was a champion of [[Czech people|Czech]] religious freedom, [[John Amos Comenius]] who is considered the father of modern education, [[Jan Kollar]] a Slovak poet who called for [[Slavic people|Slavic]] unity, [[Ľudovít Štúr]] who developed the Slovak literary language, and Bishop Stefan Moyzes who pioneered popular education in [[Slovakia]]. [[Intarsia]] done by V. Kopka of [[Moravia]] are found on the entrance door panels and the professor's desk and lectern which depicts university academic disciplines.

The [[Colonial history of the United States|Early American]] Room is one of two display rooms not used as a functional classroom, although it is opened for guided tours.

The [[England|English]] Classroom is designed in the [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor]]-[[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style after the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that was rebuilt by [[Sir Charles Barry]] following the fire of 1834.  The English Classroom is the largest of the Nationality Rooms and incorporates several original items given as gifts from the [[British Government]] from the damaged House of Commons, whose Chamber was completely destroyed, following its bombing by the Luftwaffe in 1941, including the stone fireplace, [[hearth]] tiles, [[linenfold]] [[oak]] paneling, entrance doorframe, [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel]], and [[corbels]].  The fireplace is from the Commons' "Aye Lobby", so named because members walk through it to vote "yes" to a bill, and is marked with the initials V.R. for [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria Regina]]. The [[cast-iron]] [[Fireplace fireback|fireback]] and andirons commemorate the defeat of the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588 and an inscription above the fireplace is from [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Richard II (play)|King Richard II]]'' and uses lettering adapted from the letter tiles originally designed for medieval paving by the Monks of [[Chertsey Abbey]] in [[Surrey]]. The inscription reads: "Set in the silver sea.....this blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England." Above the doorway hangs a royal [[coat of arms]] made in 1688 during the reign of [[James II of England|King James II]]. The linenfold paneling itself arrived at the University still having a blackened coat from the bombing.&lt;ref name="Mike Wereschagin"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/rss/s_457452.html |author = Mike Wereschagin| title = Celebration of Nations | work = [[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]] | date = 2006-06-10 | accessdate = 2007-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under the ceiling trusses are four carved [[limestone]] corbels from the House of Commons that are carved with a [[Tudor rose]].  Two corbels remain uncarved to emphasize the original carved corbels. The window frames, set in limestone, are characteristic of the Tudor period, and contain old imported glass, seeded and tinted, and encased in small, diamond-shaped leaded frames.  [[Stained-glass]] window medallions depict the coats of arms of English towns and cities, literary and political figures, scholars of the Universities of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], and the Houses of [[House of Lords|Lords]] and Commons.  Portraits of University of Pittsburgh alumnus and former Ambassador to the [[Court of St. James's]]&lt;!-- "St. James's" is spelled correctly; check the spelling note in the link.

A brick from [[10 Downing Street]] serves as the room's [[cornerstone]].  The [[white oak]] floor is fitted together with wooden peg [[dowels]]. Tudor-Gothic oak benches resemble the old House of Commons benches and are similarly arranged. Two English oak tables with melon-shaped legs stand before the bay.  Two House of Commons Library chairs upholstered in green leather and bearing the official gold crest featuring the [[portcullis]] and crown were a gift of [[Alfred Bossom, Baron Bossom|Lord Alfred Bossom]] and were rebuilt using wood from actual chairs in the bombed House of Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/england/engl.html | title = English Nationality Room | work = University of Pittsburgh Website | date = | accessdate = 2007-07-09 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080118101925/http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/england/engl.html | archivedate = 2008-01-18 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.flickr.com/photos/bethanyjbrady/1849970166/ | title = flickr: Cathedral of Learning 300 | date = July 2005 | accessdate = 2008-08-10 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160723000454/https://www.flickr.com/photos/bethanyjbrady/1849970166/ | archivedate = 2016-07-23 | df   =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
The [[France|French]] Classroom was designed by [[Jacques Carlu]], Director of [[Fontainebleau Schools|School of Architecture]] in [[Fontainebleau]], in the [[First French Empire|French Empire Period]] that reflects a French style inspired by the glories of the ancient and classical past that were rediscovered during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic]] campaigns in [[Greece]], [[Italy]], and [[Egypt]]. This places the timeframe of inspiration for the classroom in the late 18th century and early 19th century, just after the founding of the University of Pittsburgh in 1787, therefore making it the only classroom which represents an era postdating the founding of the University, although many room elements are influenced by the [[Palace of Versailles]] which clearly predates it.  The color scheme of the room is blue-gray, royal blue, and gold, which were suggested by French-American architect [[Paul Philippe Cret]] and are typical colors used at the height of the French Empire. The walls of the room are lined with wood paneling in classical proportions, and slender wall [[pilasters]] are capped with delicately carved ad gilded crowns. Carved ornaments of the Egyptian [[griffin]] and classical rosettes accentuate panel divisions.  A wall cabinet containing art objects, books, and medallions balances the entrance door and maintains the room's symmetry.  Crystal and metal chandeliers, which are simplified versions of those found in Palace of Versailles' [[Hall of Mirrors (Palace of Versailles)|Hall of Mirrors]], hang from a grey plaster ceiling. A parquet floor pattern also reflects many rooms in the Palace of Versailles. A [[mahogany]] professor's chair and table are of the [[Directoire|Directoire period]] design include bronze ornaments imported from France that are replicas of originals of Empire furniture in the [[Louvre]].  The mahogany student tablet armchairs are upholstered in royal blue. On the rear wall, a 16th-century Choufleur [[tapestry]] depicts an allegorical woodland scene including, among other animals, a [[unicorn]] which often served as a central figure in tapestries and legends from the [[Middle Ages]].  Gold [[damask]] draperies with a wreath and [[lyre]] motif add to the sense of French opulence and frame the windows which look out on the University's [[Heinz Memorial Chapel]], itself an example of French [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic architecture]] inspired by the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=English%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;view=image;seq=0063;node=00a872842m%3A6 |author=Ruth Crawford Mitchell |title=The French Classroom in the Cathedral of Learning |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |year=1944 |accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germany|German]] Classroom was designed by German-born architect Frank A. Linder to reflect the 16th century [[German Renaissance]] as exemplified in the Alte Aula (Great Hall) of the [[University of Heidelberg]]. The woodwork of the room was done by German-born [[Philadelphia]] decorator Gustav Ketterer and includes [[walnut]] paneling framing the blackboards, columns carved with [[Arabesque (European art)|arabesque]]s flanking the two entrance doorways, and support broken-arch [[pediments]] surmounted by carved polychromed crests of the two oldest German universities: Heidelberg (1386) and [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] (1409). The doors are mounted with ornate [[wrought-iron]] hinges and locks, and their upper panels are decorated with [[intarsia]] depicting the central square of [[Nürnberg]] on the front door and the fountain of [[Rothenburg ob der Tauber|Rothenburg]] on the rear door. Carved in the [[architrave]] above the paneling are the names of famous speaking philosophers, poets, musicians, artists, and scientists. The intarsia doors of the four corner cabinets feature tales from German folklore including [[Percival|Parsifal]] who searched for the [[Holy Grail]], [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] who was the hero of the [[Nibelungenlied]], the maiden wooed in [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe's]] poem ''[[Heidenröslein]]'', and [[Lorelei]] who was the golden-haired [[Rhine]] maiden whose song lured sailors to destruction. Painted on the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]] above the front blackboard are words from [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''Das Ideal und das Leben'', "Stern endeavor, which no arduous task can shake, to the hidden fount of true attains." The rear wall has a quotation from [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]'s ''Was wir bringen'' which reads: "Great mastery results from wise restraint, and law alone points the way to liberty." Furniture includes the professor's leather upholstered chair stands on a small platform behind a burled walnut table and student tablet armchairs are walnut with  scroll backs. Wrought-iron chandeliers are the work of German craftsman.  The display case contains gifts of artworks and books from Germany's Ministry of Education. The [[stained-glass]] windows were designed by master stained glass artist [[Charles Connick]], however they were not completed until 1953 by Connick protege Frances Van Arsdale Skinner.&lt;ref name="Connickwindows" /&gt; The windows depict characters in the [[Grimm Brothers|Grimm Brothers']] fairy tales such as [[Little Red Riding Hood]], [[Snow White|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]], [[Hansel and Gretel]], and [[Cinderella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu:80/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=English%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;node=00a872842m%3A7;view=image;seq=0079 |title=The German Classroom in the Cathedral of Learning |year=1941 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The room's columns and pilasters, as well as the coffered ceiling, bear painted decorations identical to those used on ancient Greek structures. The artwork was done by Athenian artist Demetrios Kokotsis who used the traditional [[encaustic painting]] method, employing earth colors and beeswax applied freehand which was then overlaid with 24-carat gold leaf rubbed on by polishing bones which required two men more than seven months to complete. White oak furniture, patterned after designs on Greek vases, is decorated with gold-leaf carvings and sunburst inlays of ebony. Student chair backs carry the names of Greek islands and towns. The professor's and guests' chairs bear the names of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Socrates]]. A line from [[Homer|Homer's]] [[Iliad]] exhorts students to strive for nobility and excellence. The deep red wall color is repeated in the drapery valance with its Greek key design. Archives in the alcove cabinet record visits by the Queen of Greece, and by ecclesiastic and diplomatic officials.  In 1940, one of two marble [[pilasters]] for the room that was being constructed in Greece from the [[Penteli|Mt Pentele]] stone quarry used to build the [[Parthenon]], cracked shortly before shipping to the United States. With an invading [[World War II]] army massing on its borders, the column could not be replaced. Greek architect John Travlos ordered a matching crack etched into the undamaged column in order to preserve the symmetry. The marble was transported on the last ship to sail to America prior to the invasion and occupation of Greece. In November 1941, Travlos crouched under a blanket in his apartment closet listening to banned [[BBC]] radio broadcasts. Suddenly, Greek ecclesiastical music spouted from the radio, and Travlos heard the people of Pittsburgh dedicate his memorial to Greece.&lt;ref name="Mike Wereschagin"/&gt;

[[Dénes Györgyi]], a professor at the Industrial Art School in [[Budapest]], won the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Classroom design competition sponsored by Hungary's Ministry of Education in 1930 which features [[Hungarian people|Magyar]] folk art combined with deep wood carvings and historic stained glass windows.  The walls of the room are [[oak]] veneer stained a soft tobacco brown.  The wood in the panels was carefully selected and matched, so that the natural grains form interesting decorative patterns.  The ceiling is 70 wooden cazettas suspended in a wooden frame and has a predominant hue of "[[paprika]] red", a color inspired by the peppers which are hung to dry over white fences in Hungary.  The cazettas are decorated with folk motifs (birds, hearts, and [[tulips]]) in turquoise, green, and white were painted by Antal Diossy in Budapest.  Joining the ceiling and walls is an inscription frieze with the first two stanzas of ''[[Himnusz]]'', the Hungarian National Anthem by [[Ferenc Kölcsey]]. Above the blackboard is the coat of arms of the University of Buda which was founded in 1388.  At the top is the crown of [[Stephen I of Hungary|St. Stephen]], the patron saint of Hungary and its first Christian king.  The student seats are made of oak and are unadorned except for stylized carved tulip ornaments on the back.  A bench along the rear wall and guest chairs are upholstered in blue.  Along the corridor wall, panels carved with floral, plant, and bird designs invoke a "tulip chest" which are the traditional hope chests of Hungarian village brides that are decorated with tulips.  In the display case lined with soft blue velvet is an exhibit of Hungarian porcelain, lace, embroidery, and costumed dolls.  Stained and painted glass windows depict the legend of Hungary's founding as well as important events in the nation's history and culture. The rear window depicts [[King Nimrod]] and his sons, [[Hunor and Magor]], who pursued a white stag from the east to the fertile [[Danube]] plain. Descendants of Hunor became the [[Huns]] and those of Magor became the Magyars. The bay windows commemorate historic figures and events of the [[Middle Ages]], [[Renaissance]], and 17th and 19th centuries. The oak entrance doors bears deep carvings of tulips, [[pomegranate]] leaves, daisies, and wheat.  The door's center panel states the date of the room's completion in 1938. The carvings were made by American wood carvers of Hungarian birth from [[plaster]] models that were made in Budapest to ensure Magyar authenticity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[India]]n Classroom is modeled on a typical 4th-9th century AD courtyard from  [[Nalanda University]], a [[Buddhist]] monastic university in [[Nalanda]].  At its peak, the university's five temples and 11 monasteries covered {{convert|32|acre|m2}} and attracted thousands of students from all over [[Asia]]. The room depicts a classroom courtyard at Nalanda. The pale rose bricks, specially fabricated to reflect the hue and texture of the original, form the walls, floor, pilasters, and niches. Six stone columns decorated with rosettes, swags, and fruit echo those found at Nalanda. The rear sculpture wall, a scaled down version of one at Nalanda's [[Stupa]] #3, bears images of six [[Bodhisattvas]]. Flanking display cases hold replicas of ancient bronze sculptures found at the site. A watercolor [[triptych]] depicts male and female students at Nalanda as scholar-monk Silabhadra says farewell to 7th-century Chinese traveler [[Xuanzang]]. Gurus taught classes in the courtyards, which were surrounded by residential cells. The [[cherry]] wood chalkboard doors and flanking cabinets bear carved seals of Nalanda University with recumbent deer above a [[Sanskrit]] inscription.

On the chest rests a replica of the Gospels from the [[Book of Kells]]. The wrought-iron case bears bird and beast designs drawn from the Book of Kells.  Stained-glass windows, created in 1956/7 by the Harry Clarke Studios in Dublin, portray famous teachers at three of Ireland's oldest centers of learning; [[Finnian of Clonard|St. Finnian]] at [[Clonard, County Meath|Clonard]], [[Columba|St. Columkille]] at [[Derry]], and [[Mo Chutu of Lismore|St. Carthach]] at [[Lismore, County Waterford|Lismore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Hayden |editor1-first=James J. |date=1957 |title=The Irish Room in the Cathedral of Learning, University of Pittsburgh |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;type=simple;q1=nationality%20rooms;sort=datea;rgn=subject;view=image;seq=12;idno=31735051653701;didno=31735051653701;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; |location=Pittsburgh |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |page=10 |accessdate=2014-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illuminations in the Book of Kells inspired the chair design, except for the wolfhound heads.

The [[Israel]] Heritage Classroom reflects the simplicity of a 1st-century [[Galilee|Galilean]] stone dwelling or house of assembly, this room's benches are patterned after those in the 2nd-3rd-century [[synagogue]] of [[Capernaum]]. The [[Ten Commandments]], carved in [[Hebrew]], grace the [[oak]] entrance door.  Grapes, [[pomegranates]], and [[Phoenix dactylifera|dates]] on the stone [[frieze]], copied from Capernaum, represent crops grown in the Galilee. On the window wall, an inscription discovered in the 6th-century [[Rehob]] synagogue cites the [[Talmudic law]]s governing the growing of crops each seventh year. A scroll fragment in the rear case replicates the [[Dead Sea Scrolls|Dead Sea Isaiah Scroll]] segment which contains the prophecy "They shall beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks..." Ancient wine jars flank the scroll. The professor's table, based on one found in Jerusalem's 1st-century burnt house, stands before a copy of the only existing stone [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]] which served as a functional [[candelabrum]]. The quotation on the chair reads: "I learned much from my teachers, more from my colleagues, and most of all from my pupils." Three segments from the 6th-century [[Dura Europos]] murals grace the chalkboard doors, [[Ezra|Ezra the Scribe]], reads the law; [[Moses]] brings forth water for the 12 tribes; and the sons of [[Aaron]] consecrate the Temple.  Oak benches bear the names of the 12 tribes of Israel. The floor mosaic replicates one in the 6th century Galilean synagogue of [[Beit Alfa|Beth Alpha]].

The [[Italy|Italian]] Classroom reflects the serenity of a 15th-century [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] monastery, with its traditional devotion to religion, art, music, and education. The rear choir stall bench and shuttered windows introduce the monastic theme. The blackboard doors recall an ''armadio'', a cabinet behind an altar used to hold priestly vestments. The turquoise ''soffitto a cassettoni'' ([[coffered ceiling]]), embellished with carved, gold-leafed rosettes, was inspired by one originally in the San Domenico Convent at [[Pesaro]]. In the [[architrave]], names of famous Italians are inlaid in olive wood. The lettering resembles that used in the inscription on the [[Arch of Titus]] in [[Rome]]. Bay benches are cushioned in red velvet. The red tile floor is set in a herring-bone pattern similar to that of [[Florence|Florence's]] [[Palazzo Vecchio]]. An original Florentine fireplace, made of sandstone from the quarries of [[Fiesole]], bears the carved [[Latin]] inscription, "O Lord, do not forsake me." On either side stand [[X-chair|Savonarola chairs]]. Monastery bench designs, adapted for student use, are carved with names and founding dates of Italian universities. The oldest is the [[University of Bologna]], established in 1088. From the front of the room, a bronze bust of [[Dante Alighieri]] faces Giovanni Romagnoli's mural of [[Elena Lucrezia Cornaro Piscopia]], the first woman in the world to achieve a university degree when she was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1678  by the [[University of Padua]].

The [[Japan]]ese Nationality Room celebrates traditional Japanese carpentry and woodcraft, evoking the mid-18th century [[minka]] which were houses of the non-ruling classes of Japan. This room is representative of minka that might be the residence of an important village leader in a farm village on the outskirts of [[Kyoto]] and the design represents the core rooms of the house: a plank-floored ima or household sitting room and the adjacent doma, an area with a compacted earthen floor used as an entry-way, for cooking and as a work space. The doma was also a space for household life, where farm, business and craft activities could be carried out under a roof. In the past it also provided a place for drying grain during rainy weather. A central feature of the room is the massive, rough-hewn beam, the ushibari of Japanese [[pine]], supported by posts at the boundary of the ima and doma elements of the room.  The main beam in this room had been carefully preserved by the carpenters in Japan for many years until a project could be found to appropriately utilize its unique curvature. To accommodate the weight concentrated on the primary post, the daikokubashira, the layout of the room has been designed so that this main post sits directly above the building's existing superstructure. The major posts are made of [[zelkova]], ([[keyaki]]), a hardwood with a distinctive grain pattern. The other beams are made of American pine. The posts and beams are connected without nails, using traditional joinery techniques. The ceiling is of [[bamboo]] with joined beams which would have allowed for the circulation of warm air from fireplaces below.  The walls mimics the typical mud plaster walls  through the use of textured wallpaper and  wooden [[wainscoting]] for greater durability. The bay window is a structure not in keeping with traditional Japanese design and has been masked with panels that suggest shôji, sliding doors of lattice frames, covered with translucent paper. The ima is suggested with a plank wood floor covering the largest portion of the room.  The floor toward the front of the room is made of a simulated earthen material to represent a portion of the doma where it meets the ima's wooden floor. Although the traditional design would call for the wooden floor to be much higher than the dirt floor, this feature has been eliminated in the classroom for practicality.  Located on the rear wall, is the [[tokonoma]], a raised alcove for the display of treasured objects, flower arrangements, and seasonal decorations. The tokonoma has been built in shoin-style, with shôji along its exterior side. The corner post, tokobashira, is made of [[ebony]] and the floor of the tokonoma is [[tatami]]. The display cases at the rear of the room and along the interior wall contain artifacts in keeping with the period and include a [[chagama]] and [[furo]], an iron kettle with metal charcoal hearth/brazier combination, used in the "tea ceremony." While typical minka would have no chairs at all, in keeping with its function as a classroom, the classroom has wooden chairs designed and crafted specifically for students and are consistent in design with the rest of the room. Sliding wooden panels cover the blackboard at the front of the room. The interior surface of the entry door has been modified with a wooden treatment that suggests the sliding door that was the typical entrance to a house of this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/countries/japan.html |title=Marie Mazzocco, The Japanese Nationality Room, 1999-05-26 |publisher=Pitt.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209004337/http://www.pitt.edu/~natrooms/countries/japan.html |archivedate=2012-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lithuania]]n Classroom is dominated by a fresco depicting [[Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis|Mikalojus Konstantinas Čiurlionis']] famous painting ''The Two Kings'' portrays the reverence Lithuanians have for their villages. This mural sets the tone for a room that pays tribute to the symbolism and love of nature and home reflected in Lithuanian folk art. The door's wooden planks are laid in a diamond pattern similar to those of many farm structures. At the center of the door is a carved rosette, symbol of fire. Above the entrance, a stylized sun between two horses' heads represents light and sound believed to ward off evil spirits. The [[white oak]] molding of intersecting [[scallops]] resembles decorations found on farm granaries or kleitis. Names of famous Lithuanians are carved on the frieze above the blackboard. The wall fabric is linen woven in a design called "The Path of the Birds." Its frame is of white oak and rare [[bog oak]] that acquires its deep hue while submerged in a marshy bog for decades. Lithuanian farmers would thus preserve prime trees in order to make furniture pieces that were treasured as heirlooms. The professor's desk is modeled after a household table and the lectern incorporates details of a spinning wheel spindle. Student chairs are carved with a design found on household utensils. The radiator enclosure is perforated with a design of wild [[rue]] leaves, the [[Lithuanian national emblem]]. Traditionally, a bride is crowned with a wreath of rue, symbol of chastity. Windows of handpressed glass bear leaded medallions in the form of sun ornaments often found on roadside shrines.

The [[Norway|Norwegian]] Classroom was designed in [[Oslo]] in an 18th-century peasant style using Norwegian building techniques, painted decoration, and craftsmanship by architect Georg Eliassen just prior to the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Plans for the room were sent on the last ship to leave [[Pechengsky District|Petsamo]] for the [[United States]] where they were completed by University Architect Albert A. Klimcheck.  Walls of the main space are paneled with vertical overlapping [[spruce]] boards hand-rubbed with wax.  The walls in the front of the room are painted a soft blue and decorated with floral designs reminiscent of the 18th century [[rosemaling]] technique.

Because living and bedrooms were often merged into one room during this era, two of the panels swing open as if they would reveal traditional built-in-beds, but instead conceal the blackboard. The room features high-sloped ceilings reflective of those in [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] peasant homes that keep snow from accumulating during the severe winters. Spruce boards are laid in a herringbone pattern slanting upward to a plane of flat boards decorated by two hand-carved, painted rosettes with a symbol for the [[midnight sun]].  Wooden chandeliers bearing a painted design incorporating "1945", the year the room was opened, hang from the flat surfaces.  The professor's section of the room has a low raftered ceiling.

The transition between the two parts of the room is indicated by a corner kleberstone fireplace in which [[birch]] logs were burned standing on end to assure that smoke would rise up the chimney.  Windows are of handmade opalescent glass tinted pale yellow.  Since a bay window is not a [[Scandinavian Peninsula|Scandinavian]] tradition, the area is plastered, paved with [[slate]], and treated as a traditional alcove. The student tablet armchairs are low-backed and the professor's chair is of a typical [[Viking]] design with carved heads of beasts and an intertwining dragon motif that traditionally serves as a symbol that protects against evil.

The room features a century-old [[grandfather clock]] with an engraved dial and a case that is painted to match the wall decorations of the smaller room.  Above the rear wall bench and flanked by corner [[display cabinet]]s decorated with rosemaling, hangs a framed copy of a 1695 Norwegian woolen [[tapestry]] depicting the [[Biblical]] parable of the five wise and five foolish virgins&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/bethanyjbrady/1849173165/sizes/l/ |title=Norwegian Room: Cathedral of Learning 345, 2005-07 |publisher=Flickr.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904054553/https://www.flickr.com/photos/bethanyjbrady/1849173165/sizes/l/ |archivedate=2015-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poland|Polish]] Classroom was inspired by rooms in [[Cracow|Cracow's]] [[Wawel Castle]], for centuries the residence of kings. The Polish astronomer [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], and the science that his theories revolutionized, are also a major theme of the room. A replica of the famous [[Jan Matejko]] portrait of Copernicus shows him as a young man pursuing his study of the universe from a workshop on the roof of his uncle's house in Allenstein ([[Olsztyn]]). In the bay stands an enlarged replica of the 16th-century [[Jagiellonian globe]], one of the oldest existing globes to depict [[North America]] as a separate continent. The original globe was only eight inches high and was designed to operate as a clock and calendar and it took a [[metalsmith]] in Cracow five years to complete the large globe in this room.

Artists from Cracow also came to Pittsburgh to paint the ceiling of {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} beams with informal geometric [[Renaissance]] decorations. The room is illuminated by a bronze chandelier bearing a stylized [[Polish eagle]]. The [[walnut]] seminar table was copied from one in a state dining room at Wawel Castle. The windows combine hexagonal handmade [[roundels]], similar to those in Wawel Castle, with stained-glass coats of arms representing Polish institutions of higher education. The cornerstone is a fragment of Gothic cornice preserved from the [[Collegium Maius]] (1369), the ancient [[Jagiellonian Library]]. Poland's music is represented by the original manuscript of [[Ignace Paderewski]]'s only opera, ''[[Manru]]'', which is displayed in the archive cabinet.

The [[Romania]]n Classroom was designed in [[Bucharest]] by Nicolae Ghica-Budeşti. The carved doorframe is characteristic of stone thresholds of Romanian monasteries and is made is of American [[limestone]] selected due to its similarity to Romanian limestone used in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania|royal palace]] at Bucharest. The entrance door of the Romanian Classroom is ornately carved [[oak]] reminiscent of [[Byzantine churches (buildings)|Byzantine churches]] in Romania. The words of [[Vasile Alecsandri]], one of the greatest Romanian poets of the 19th century, are carved overhead in the stone door frame from his ''Ode to the Year 1855'': "The Romanian is like the mighty rock which amidst the waves of the stormy and majestic sea forever remains unmoved." The floor is laid in square blocks of pink [[marble]] imported from quarries at Ruşchiţa. The black boards are set in arched oak panels, carved in a manner of icon screens in [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Greek Catholic]] Romanian churches. These are separated by carved-twisted rope which suggests the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] origin of many of Romania's artistic traditions. Ancient original icons from Romania depicting the [[Virgin and Child]], [[Christ]], the [[Dormition of the Virgin]], and [[Saint Mark]] are embedded in the upper section of each panel.

White arca paint mixed with color gives the smooth plastered walls a bluish pink tint. A Byzantine-style [[mosaic]] embedded in the rear wall, a gift of the Romanian government, was executed by Bucharest ceramicist Nora Steriade in gold, turquoise, bronze, ruby red, and black pieces of glass, and was originally part of the Romanian Pavilion at the [[1939 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://documenting.library.pitt.edu/islandora/object/pitt%3A31735062128982/viewer#page/50/mode/1up|title=photo caption (mosaic)|journal=Pitt|date=Summer 1942|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|number=12|page=48|accessdate=March 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lettering for the inscription and for the entrance text is the work of Alexander Seceni. The mosaic depicts [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]], Prince of [[Wallachia]], who refused to recant the [[Christian faith]] even at the cost of his own life and the lives of the male members of his family. The six windows have rounded [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] heads reflecting tradition brought from Rome when they conquered the original [[Dacia]]n settlers in 106 AD.

Two small window casements are deeply recessed and have marble window ledges. The four large center windows, form an alcove shut off from the main part of the room by an iron grilled gates wrought in Romania and hung in an arch. These gates swing back in folded sections against the plastered wall. A slab of polished marble tops the wrought-iron [[radiator]] grille. Yellow silk draperies frame the windows and ancient icons befitting the season and holidays are exhibited in the alcove which is reminiscent of an icon shrine in an Orthodox Church.   The student chairs are of dark oak hand-carved by Romanian peasant artisans using simple [[Pocket knife|pocketknives]] and each [[Splat (furniture)|splat]] bears a different design.  The professor's reading desk was adapted from an Eastern Orthodox Church [[lectern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Scottish%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;node=00a872842m%3A13;view=image;seq=0177 |title=The Romainian Classrooms in the Cathedral of Learning |year=1944 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Classroom contains folk ornamentation with traditional motifs from [[Byzantium]], the spiritual center of Russia.  The seminar table is made of oak slabs matched in contrasting grain and held together by ornamental keys. The cut-out apron is characteristic of massive tables in the [[Vologda]] district. The back of each student's chair has a cruciform circle pattern surmounted by triangles carved with symbols of regional or stylistic significance including the [[reindeer]] which symbolizes the [[tundra]] and the [[sturgeon]] that represents the [[Volga River]].  The professor's chair has a back of spirals surmounted by two [[Peafowl|peacocks]] worshipping the tree of life.  The podium is ecclesiastic in character and suggests the analoi used in Orthodox churches to support heavy Bibles. The blackboard is patterned after a [[triptych]], or three-leafed frame which holds icons.

The doors of the blackboard are a grille of wooden spirals backed by red velvet.  Above them is a carved panel with Sirin and Alcanost, the twin birds of Russian folklore that depict joy and sorrow as indistinguishable. A [[Dado (architecture)|dado]] or low [[wainscot]] of simple horizontal oaken boards surrounds the room and incorporates the blackboard, the corner cupboard, and kiot which is a [[Slavic (language)|Slavic]] term for a wall frame treated as a piece of furniture. Within the kiot hangs an vishivka ([[appliqué]] and [[embroidery]]) banner of [[Saint George]], patron saint of [[Moscow]] since the 15th century. The banner was made with pieces of 16th and 17th century fabric from [[Venice]] and [[Paris]] and is an example of needlework once popular with the Russian aristocracy.  The words "Valorous youth victorious over forces of evil and darkness" are carved in both [[Russian (language)|Russian]] and English below the banner. A copy of the Avinoff family icon in the room depicts the miraculous saving of the city of Kitej from a [[Tatars|Tartar]] invasion in the 14th century.  The ceiling is cornered with designs resembling those used to form traditional Easter cakes and which symbolize the four seasons, with a [[bud]] for Spring, a [[sunflower]] for summer, [[grapes]] for Autumn, and a [[pine cone]] for Winter. A [[wrought iron]] chandelier was created by Russian-born Hyman Blum.

Following a visit from [[Dmitry Medvedev]] in 2009, a display cabinet with carved ornamentation matching the rooms original carvings was installed to house three gifts presented by the then [[Russian President]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wilsonandmccracken.com/cabinetry/u-pittsburgh-russian-nationality-room/|title=U.

The [[Scotland|Scottish]] Classroom was designed by [[Reginald Fairlie]] of [[Edinburgh]] in the period style of the early 17th century.  The woodwork is carefully selected and treated English [[Pollarding|pollard]] oak.  The names of distinguished Scots are carved in the ribbon bands of the panels and include [[David Livingstone]] who was an African missionary and explorer, [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] who authored ''[[Treasure Island]]'', and [[Alexander Fleming]] who discovered [[penicillin]].  The inscriptions above the doors and the rear cabinet are from "[[The Brus]]" by the 14th-century Scottish poet [[John Barbour (poet)|John Barbour]].  The room's oak doors were copied from the entrance of [[Rowallan Castle]] in [[Ayrshire]].  A 16th-century Scottish proverb above the blackboard was taken from the [[Cowgate]] in Edinburgh and is known as "the Scottish Golden Rule" which reads: "Gif Ye did as Ye sould Ye might haif as Ye would." The [[plaster]] frieze was adapted from the plaster frieze at [[Elcho Castle]] in [[Perthshire]] and incorporates symbols of 14 [[Scottish clans]] which had members on the room committee, such as the buckle of the [[Clan Leslie|Leslie Clan]].  The [[thistle]], Scotland's national flower, is rendered on the cornerstone as a tree-of-life.  The [[overmantel]] of the Scottish [[sandstone]] fireplace that is flanked by carved kists, or log storage chests, is dominated by a portrait of poet [[Robert Burns]] that is copied from an original by [[Alexander Nasmyth]] which hangs in the [[National Portrait Gallery of Scotland]].  Above the portrait is the cross of [[St. Andrew]], Scotland's patron saint. The bronze statuettes on the mantel near an arrangement of dried [[Calluna|heather]] are miniature replicas of heroic statues at the gateway to [[Edinburgh Castle]] and represent the 13th-century patriot [[Sir William Wallace]] and the 14th century freedom fighter, [[Robert the Bruce]], both of whom were popularized in the movie ''[[Braveheart]]''.

Medallions in the bay windows represent the coats of arms of the four ancient Scottish universities: [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]], [[University of St. Andrew's|St. Andrew's]], [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]], and [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]].  The medallions in the front and rear windows are of [[Elgin Cathedral|Elgin]] and [[Melrose Abbey]]s which were 13th and 16th century seats of learning.  The draperies are of [[Crewel embroidery|crewel-embroidered]] linen.  The rooms lighting fixtures were inspired by an iron [[coronet]] in Edinburgh's John Knox Museum that was retrieved from the battlefield of [[Battle of Bannockburn|Bannockburn]] at which Scotland won its independence from England in 1314.  Student's seats resemble a chair that belonged to [[John Knox]].  An old Scottish church furnished the pattern for the reading stand.  The rear cabinet, based on an [[aumbry]] or weapon closet, contain artifacts such as [[pewter]] and [[Porcelain|china]] used at Soutar's Inn in Ayrshire that was frequented by Robert Burns. The panels in the doors, mantel, and in-the-wall cabinets were carved in Edinburgh by Thomas Good and then shipped to Pittsburgh.  The cabinetwork was done in the shops of Gustav Ketterer of [[Philadelphia]].  [[Wrought iron]]work was done by [[Samuel Yellin]].  Cut into stone  above the doorways are the thistle and the [[Royal Arms of Scotland|Lion Rampant]], the Scottish emblem incorporated into [[British coat of arms|Britain's royal arms]]. The chairman of the original Scottish Classroom Committee was [[Jock Sutherland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Scottish%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;view=image;seq=209;node=00a872842m%3A15;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; |title=The Scottish Classroom in the Cathedral of Learning |year=1940 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;g=documentingpitt;xc=1;xg=1;q1=Scottish%20room;rgn=full%20text;idno=00a872842m;didno=00a872842m;node=00a872842m%3A3;view=image;seq=9;page=root;size=s;frm=frameset; |title=Classrooms in the Cathedral of Learning | pages= 5 |year=c. 1944 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |accessdate=2008-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sweden|Swedish]] Classroom reflects a peasant cottage and contains murals painted by [[Olle Nordmark]]. The special glory of the room is the rear wall paintings. The inspiration for the four framed paintings came from painted panels done by the 18th-century painter from [[Hälsingland]], [[Gustav Reuter]]. Linton Wilson found the panels at the [[Nordic Museum]].&lt;ref name="pres_swedishroom"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;view=toc;idno=31735051654220 |title=University of Pittsburgh presentation ceremonies for the Scottish, German, Swedish and Russian Rooms |location=Pittsburgh, Pa. |year=1938 |pages=13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813045331/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;view=toc;idno=31735051654220 |archivedate=2011-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hooded brick fireplace derives from an original in the [[Bollnäs]] Cottage in [[Skansen]], the famous outdoor museum in [[Stockholm]]. The brilliant white walls and fireplace are constructed of 200-year-old handmade bricks. The fire tools were handwrought by Ola Nilsson, a Swedish blacksmith. He reconstructed tools used in his childhood home in Sweden.&lt;ref name="swedishroom"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=University of Pittsburgh |url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;idno=31735051654212;view=toc;frm=frameset |title=The Swedish Classroom in the Cathedral of Learning, University of Pittsburgh |location=Pittsburgh, Pa |year=1940 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610200631/http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?c=pittmiscpubs;cc=pittmiscpubs;idno=31735051654212;view=toc;frm=frameset |archivedate=2015-06-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subtle sense of humor associated with the [[Swedish people]] is revealed in the room's paintings. A wall fresco secco depicts the [[Three Wise Men]] dressed as [[cavaliers]] riding to [[Bethlehem]], in two directions. In their midst is Sweden's patron saint, [[Catherine of Vadstena|St. Catherine]]. The sloped ceiling bears decorations in which the central figure is the [[Archangel Gabriel]], seen as a droll trumpeter with two left feet. Nearby are renditions of Justice and Knowledge surrounded by groupings of flowers. Justice uses her blindfold to hold scales that appear balanced but have an off-center fulcrum. Knowledge seems puzzled as she contemplates writing on her slate with a quill pen.

Furniture and woodwork are the work of Erik Jansson of Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="pres_swedishroom"/&gt; The classroom's oak furniture is stained a muted gray-blue tone, similar to that found in old Swedish homes. Floral designs, in colors that complement the amber tone of fir wall benches, brighten the door and archive cabinet. The red brick floor is set in a [[herringbone pattern|herringbone]] pattern.

Originally a library built in 1782 in a wealthy Damascan merchant's home, the [[Syria]]-[[Lebanon]] Room was moved intact to its location in the Cathedral of Learning following a six-year effort to fund and install the room by the Syrian and Lebanese communities in Pittsburgh.  Because of the fragility and pricelessness of the furnishing, it has been closed for class use and is one of two display rooms. The [[Tilia|linden]]-paneled walls and ceilings are decorated with “[[gesso]] painting,” a mixture of chalk and glue applied by brush in intricate relief, then painted and overlaid with silver and gold leaf. The room features a (now improperly oriented) [[mihrab]] with a stalactite vault traditionally housing the [[Koran]] and [[prayer rug]].

The sofas, from the Arabic word "suffah", are covered in satin and rest on a dark red and white marble foundation.  The marble floor slopes down at the entrance where visitors would remove their shoes before entering. In 1997, a glass-paneled French-style door to the room was added to allow the room to be visible from passers-by.

The [[Turkey|Turkish]] Nationality Room was based on a baş odası, or main room, of a typical Turkish house or hayat with an outer gallery and a side [[iwan]]. The iwan is intended to be used as an entrance area similar to the royal pavilion, annexed to the [[Yeni Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Mosque]] in the [[Eminönü]] district of [[Istanbul]], which was built in 1663 for the use of [[Mehmed IV|Sultan Mehmet IV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/oa04/TNR/design.html | title=Design | publisher=Turkish Nationality Room | accessdate=2012-01-05 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208050744/http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/oa04/TNR/design.html | archivedate=2012-02-08 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the iwan of the Turkish Nationality Room, four ceramic panels, painted on clay tiles in [[Ankara]], represent various cultures and points in Turkish history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=17517 | title=Construction begins on 2 nationality rooms | first=Peter | last=Hart | newspaper=University Times | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh, PA | date=2011-09-01 | accessdate=2012-01-05 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225060041/http://www.utimes.pitt.edu/?p=17517 | archivedate=2014-02-25 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest ceramic is a portrait of [[Mustafa Kemal Ataturk]], the founder and first president of the [[Republic of Turkey]], who is depicted instructing the nation on the [[Turkish alphabet]] adopted in 1928. Other panels depict [[Uyghurs|Uighur]] princesses, who represent the importance of women in circa 9th-century Turkish culture, a reproduction of "Two merchants in conversation" by [[:tr:Mehmed Siyah Kalem|Mehmed Siyah Kalem]] which signifies the appearance of realism in Turkish drawing around the 14th century; and a depiction of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] at the circumcision ceremony of [[Şehzade Beyazıt]] and Şehzade Cihangir which represents the apex of [[Ottoman Turks|Ottoman]] power and culture in the 16th century.  The main room attempts to convey the theme of democracy with its seating distributed around the perimeter of the room which suggests that all occupants are equals. Hardwood seats mimic [[divan]]-style seating found in a typical baş odası with back panels that function as writing tablets which when retracted form a "parted curtain" motif, a common shape used for household wall niches. The room's ceiling, modeled after the Emirhocazade Ahmet Bey summer house in [[Safranbolu]], is a combination of traditional çitakâri and kündekâri carpentry art that creates intricate geometric patterns using small pieces of wood attached without metal fasteners or glue. Clear glass windows along one wall frame a painted mural depicting a panoramic view of Istanbul which is feature similar to that seen in the mirrored room of the [[Topkapi Palace]]. The stained glass windows depict a tulip shape which served as a symbol of the Ottomans in the 18th century.  Display cases contain historic examples of Turkish calligraphy, ceramics, jewelry, miniatures and textiles as well as an [[evil eye]]. The entrance symbol above the exterior door depicts the current [[flag of Turkey]], adopted in 1936.

The entrance has an archaic trapezoidal form with carved motifs of water (chevron), wheat, and sunflowers. The [[lintel]] inscription commemorates Ukraine's millennium of [[Christianity]] (988–1988). The stove tiles depict festival practices and daily life. A pokutia, or place of honor, is defined by the benches and the traditional icons of [[St. Nicholas]], the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mother of God]], [[Christ]] the Teacher, and [[St. George]].

The chalkboard doors bearing the Tree of Life are surmounted by three [[Cyrillic]] alphabets used in Ukraine in the 11th, 17th, and 19th centuries. On the right wall, a copper bas-relief depicts the development of Ukrainian culture over the millennia. It portrays cultural centers, historical figures, rituals, monuments, and the evolution of Ukrainian ornament. The massive crossbeam's elaborate carvings include a protective solar symbol and a quotation from Ukraine's bard [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814–1861): "Learn, my brothers! Think and read ... Learn foreign thoughts, but do not shun your own country!"  Beyond the wood posts, reminiscent of a gallery, the display case houses traditional Ukrainian art and crafts.

In order to worship and hold church services in their native [[Welsh language]], and spurred on by the non-conformist movement started by the [[Protestant Reformation]], the Welsh people met in secret locations such as barns or homes, as suggested by the simple white walled capel modeled in this Nationality Room.  The minister would live at one end as depicted by the display case with dishes and pottery that would be found in a Welsh kitchen and the long oak case clock seated on a Welsh slate foundation opposite the main blue door.  The clock, considered one of the most important furnishings in a Welsh home, has, instead of numbers, a painted square face that spells out "Richard Thomas" suggesting that he was both the maker and owner of the clock. The bay window serves as the focus of the Welsh chapel worship, including a blue raised pulpit with a view of the entire congregation and two Deacon's benches from which to monitor the actions of the minister and congregation.

At the other end of the room is a table bearing a lectern, as such worship places would often become a school room for both children and adults during week days.  Above the chalk board is the [[Lord's Prayer]], written in [[Welsh language|Welsh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://stdavidssociety.homestead.com/files/newsletter_Oct_2009.pdf | title=St. David's Newsletter | date=September 2009 | accessdate=2009-10-06 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712215215/http://stdavidssociety.homestead.com/files/newsletter_Oct_2009.pdf | archivedate=2011-07-12 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pew benches of [[pine]] face the lectern.  Along the wall, larger and more comfortable blue-painted pew boxes with wooden floors, often also serving as barn cattle stalls, would have served wealthier families who would sometimes bring straw, blankets, hot bricks, or dogs to keep them warm. To reflect the simplicity of such meeting places, the ceiling beams are made of [[Populus|poplar]] and flooring suggests a typical capel dirt floor.  The carved stone dragon over the doorway, the long-time Welsh national symbol, represents the legendary victory of the Red Dragon over the White Dragon of numerous tales of medieval Wales and represents the triumph of Good over Evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Classroom was designed by Professor [[:hr:Vojta Braniš|Vojta Braniš]], a sculptor and director of the Industrial Art School in [[Zagreb]].  The walls are paneled in [[Slavonia]]n oak and hand-carved with geometric figures and the old Slavonic heart design which is combined with a running geometric border, a favorite with [[South Slavs]].  This type of work, known as "notch-carving", was traditionally done with a penknife as pastime of peasants.  On the corridor wall is a specially designed coat of arms featuring a double-headed eagle symbolizing the religious influences of Eastern [[Byzantine Empire|Empire of Byzantium]] and Western [[Roman Empire|Empire of Rome]] along with the founding dates of the universities in [[University of Belgrade|Belgrade]], [[University of Ljubljana|Ljubljana]], and [[University of Zagreb|Zagreb]].  The ceiling is carved with intricate [[Croats|Croatian]], [[Slovenes|Slovenian]], and [[Serbs|Serbian]] folk motifs and the wooden chandeliers are similar to those in the [[Beli dvor|White Palace]] in Belgrade. The professor's chair and guests chairs were carved by students at the International Art School in Zagreb, and each spindle of the chairs bears a different notched design.  At the window, a bronze sculpture by Vojta Braniš, "Post-War Motherhood", depicts a barefoot mother nursing her child whom she has protected during the long months of war.  In the display cabinet is a lace portrayal of the [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] of Brežje by Slovenes Leopoldina Pelhan and her student Mila Božičkova which took six months to complete and was inspired by the story of a lace Madonna created by the villagers of [[Sveta Gora]] in order to replace a priceless painting during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&amp;dat=19841129&amp;id=YOsdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-mEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4908,9389725&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Press]] |date=November 29, 1984 |title=Heirlooms decorate Pitt Nationality Rooms for December tours |page=C6 |accessdate=May 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceiling squares contain one of the three alternating ceiling ornaments suggesting flowers, stars, the sun, and other radiating geometric patterns, which are organized into a matrix of 9 by 7 squares.

Above the paneled walls, six portraits depict prominent Yugoslavs. On the front wall are portraits of [[Vuk Stefanović Karadžić]] (1787–1864) who compiled the Serbian dictionary and collected, edited, and published Serbian national ballads and folk songs; and Croatian statesman [[Josip Juraj Strossmayer|Bishop Josip Juraj Strossmayer]] (1815–1905) who was known for his efforts to achieve understanding between the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Greek Orthodox]] churches, founder of the Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts (now the [[Croatian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]). On the corridor wall are likenesses of [[Jurij Vega|Baron George von Vega]] (1754–1802), a Slovenian officer in the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] army and mathematician recognized for various works including a book of logarithm tables; and [[Petar II Petrović-Njegoš|Petar Petrović Njegoš]] (1813–1851), the last prince-bishop of [[Montenegro]], who was celebrated for his poetry.  Represented on the rear wall are [[Roger Joseph Boscovich|Rugjer Bošković]] (1711–1787), a Croatian scientist distinguished for his achievements in the fields of mathematics, optics, and astronomy; and [[France Prešeren|France Ksaver Prešeren]] (1800–1849) who is considered one of the greatest native-language Slovenian poets.

The Yugoslav Classroom's Executive Committee was first organized in 1926 under the chairmanship of Anton Gazdić, the president of the [[Croatian Fraternal Union]]. After his death in September 1933 the new chairman was Steve Babić, the previous vice-chairman, and the new vice-chairwoman became Catherine Rušković McAleer. Famous Croatian sculptor [[Ivan Meštrović]] was a great supporter of the Classroom and gave two of his works to the University, one a bust of [[Mihajlo Pupin]] and the other a self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch Starrett, Agnes (ed.)

The '''open-design movement''' involves the development of physical products, machines and systems through use of publicly shared design information. This includes the making of both [[free and open-source software]] (FOSS) as well as [[open-source hardware]]. The process is generally facilitated by the Internet and often performed without monetary compensation. The goals and philosophy of the movement are identical to that of the [[open-source movement]], but are implemented for the development of physical products rather than software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adciv.org/Open_collaborative_design |title=Open collaborative design |publisher=AdCiv |date=2010-07-29 |accessdate=2013-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open design is a form of [[co-creation]], where the final product is designed by the users, rather than an external stakeholder such as a private company.

== Origin ==
Sharing of manufacturing information can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nuvolari, Alessandro 2004. Collective Invention during the British Industrial Revolution: The Case of the Cornish Pumping Engine. Cambridge Journal of Economics, 28, nr. 3: 347–363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Robert C. 1983. Collective Invention. Journal of Economic Behavior and Organization, 4, no. 1: 1–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Aggressive patenting put an end to that period of extensive knowledge sharing.&lt;ref&gt;Bessen, James E. and Nuvolari, Alessandro, Knowledge Sharing Among Inventors: Some Historical Perspectives (2012, forthcoming). In: Dietmar Harhoff and Karim Lakhani eds., Revolutionizing Innovation: Users, Communities and Open Innovation. Cambridge: MIT Press. Pre-Print: Boston Univ. School of Law, Law and Economics Research Paper No. 11-51; LEM Working Paper 2011/21. Available at http://www.bu.edu/law/faculty/scholarship/workingpapers/documents/BessenJ-NuvolariA101411fin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
More recently, principles of open design have been related to the [[free software|free]] and [[open-source software|open-source]] software movements.&lt;ref name=ODMF&gt;Vallance, Kiani and Nayfeh, Open Design of Manufacturing Equipment, CIRP 1st Int. Conference on Agile, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 [[Eric S. Raymond]], [[Tim O'Reilly]] and [[Larry Augustin]] established "open source" as an alternative expression to "free software," and in 1997 [[Bruce Perens]] published [[the Open Source Definition]]. In late 1998, Dr. Sepehr Kiani (a PhD in mechanical engineering from MIT) realized that designers could benefit from open source policies, and in early 1999 he convinced Dr. Ryan Vallance and Dr. Samir Nayfeh of the potential benefits of open design in machine design applications.&lt;ref name=bazaar&gt;R. Ryan Vallance, Bazaar Design of Nano and Micro Manufacturing Equipment, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Together they established the [[Open Design Foundation]] (ODF) as a non-profit corporation, and set out to develop an Open Design Definition.&lt;ref name=bazaar/&gt;

The idea of open design was taken up, either simultaneously or subsequently, by several other groups and individuals. The principles of open design are closely similar to those of [[open-source hardware]] design, which emerged in March 1998 when Reinoud Lamberts of the [[Delft University of Technology]] proposed on his “Open Design Circuits” website the creation of a hardware design community in the spirit of free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opencollector.org/history/OpenDesignCircuits/reinoud_announce |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-10-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812185631/http://www.opencollector.org/history/OpenDesignCircuits/reinoud_announce |archivedate=2007-08-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronen Kadushin coined the title "Open Design" in his 2004 Master’s thesis, and the term was later formalized in the 2010 Open Design Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;

== Current directions ==
[[File:Open Source Ecology, Practical post scarcity.ogv|thumb|right|[[Open Source Ecology]], open source farming and industrial machinery]]
The open-design movement currently unites two trends. On one hand, people apply their skills and time on projects for the [[common good]], perhaps where funding or commercial interest is lacking, for [[developing country|developing countries]] or to help spread ecological or cheaper technologies. On the other hand, open design may provide a framework for developing advanced projects and technologies that might be beyond the resource of any single company or country and involve people who, without the [[copyleft]] mechanism, might not collaborate otherwise. There is now also a third trend, where these two methods come together to use high-tech open-source (e.g. 3D printing) but customized local solutions for [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;J. M Pearce, C. Morris Blair, K. J. Laciak, R. Andrews, A. Nosrat and I. Zelenika-Zovko, “3-D Printing of Open Source Appropriate Technologies for Self-Directed Sustainable Development”, Journal of Sustainable Development 3(4), pp. 17-29 (2010). [http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/jsd/article/view/6984]&lt;/ref&gt; Open Design holds great potential in driving future innovation as resent research has proven that stakeholder users working together produce more innovative designs than designers consulting users through more traditional means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mitchell|first1=Val|last2=Ross|first2=Tracy|last3=Sims|first3=Ruth|last4=Parker|first4=Christopher J.|title=Empirical investigation of the impact of using co-design methods when generating proposals for sustainable travel solutions|journal=CoDesign||date=2015|volume=12|issue=4|pages=205-220|doi=10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open machine design as compared to open-source software==

The open-design movement is currently fairly nascent but holds great potential for the future. In some respects design and engineering are even more suited to open collaborative development than the increasingly common open-source software projects, because with 3D models and photographs the concept can often be understood visually. It is not even necessary that the project members speak the same languages to usefully collaborate.

However, there are certain barriers to overcome for open design when compared to software development where there are mature and widely used tools available and the duplication and distribution of code cost next to nothing. Creating, testing and modifying physical designs is not quite so straightforward because of the effort, time and cost required to create the physical artefact; although with access to emerging flexible computer-controlled manufacturing techniques the complexity and effort of construction can be significantly reduced (see tools mentioned in the [[fab lab]] article).

Open design is currently a fledgling movement consisting of several unrelated or loosely related initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Howard, Sofiane Achiche, Ali Özkil and Tim C. McAloone, Open Design And Crowdsourcing: Maturity, Methodology And Business
Models, International Design Conference - Design 2012, Dubrovnik - Croatia, May 21–24, 2012.[http://orbit.dtu.dk/ws/files/9719320/Open%20Design%20-%20DESIGN12%20soac_thow.pdf open access]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these organizations are single, funded projects, while a few organizations are focusing on an area needing development. In some cases (e.g. [[Thingiverse]] for 3D printable designs or [[Appropedia]] for [[open source appropriate technology]]) organizations are making an effort to create a centralized open source design repository as this enables innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce J., Albritton S., Grant G., Steed G., &amp; Zelenika I. 2012.

'''Patent analysis''' is a family of techniques and tools for studying the information present within and attached to [[patents]], a major form of [[intellectual property]]. 
Although this has traditionally been done using spreadsheet-based [[data analysis]] methods, the field of intellectual property has witnessed a surge in the availability of software-based patent analysis tools.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

The cost structure of most patent analysis tools varies from [[freemium]] business models to annual [[subscriptions]].

The '''Powerhouse Arts District''' is a historic warehouse district in [[Downtown Jersey City|Downtown]] [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]], [[United States]], which takes its name from the unused generating station [[Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse]] currently undergoing an extensive stabilization effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jclandmarks.org/campaign-warehousedistrict.shtml/ Warehouse Historic District] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080611052218/http://www.jclandmarks.org/campaign-warehousedistrict.shtml |date=2008-06-11 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpowerhouse.org/|title=Jersey City Powerhouse Official Website|publisher=|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerseycityindependent.com/author/admin/|title=The Jersey City Independent|work=The Jersey City Independent|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This neighborhood was previously called "WALDO", an acronym for Work And Live District Overlay, but has since been renamed though is still occasionally used on maps and in local parlance. Part of what was once called the [[Horseshoe, Jersey City|Horseshoe Section]],  the neighborhood's informal borders are [[Newport, Jersey City|Newport]] to the north, [[Exchange Place (Jersey City)|Exchange Place]] to the east, [[Paulus Hook]] to the south and [[Harsimus Cove]] to the west. 

The landmarked [[Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse]] is at Provost St. between 1st and Bay Sts ({{coord|40|43|16|N|74|2|25|W|name=Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company Warehouse}}). The [[Pavonia-Newport (HBLR station)|Pavonia-Newport]], [[Harsimus Cove (HBLR station)|Harsimus Cove]], and [[Harborside Financial Center (HBLR station)|Harborside]] stations of the [[Hudson-Bergen Light Rail]], and the [[Grove Street (PATH station)|Grove Street]] station of the [[Port Authority Trans-Hudson|PATH]] system are nearby.

==WALDO and PAD==
[[File:Great-a-p-warehouse-jersey-city.jpg|thumb|left|The A &amp; P Warehouse]]
'''WALDO''' was the name of a planning strategy adopted into Jersey City zoning in 2002 per a proposal written by the [[Urban Land Institute]], and was deleted from the zoning on January 24, 2007. As the name implies, the purpose was to most effectively re-use an eight block area of industrial buildings, and transition them to include more residences, without zoning them a purely residential use. Currently, most zoning codes do not allow industrial and residential uses to co-exist on the same lot. The district also aimed at retaining the high bulk, low rise industrial buildings which were threatened by development of high rise towers in the area.

The plan indicated that roughly half of the apartments built in the existing industrial buildings in the eight block neighborhood must go to artists. Under the district plan, two industrial buildings were renovated into loft apartments, and one new building, Waldo Lofts, was constructed. During the district's lifespan, there were several attempts to bring in more housing and studios for artists, to make the area more pedestrian friendly, and to bring in art schools or museums.  There were also been proposals to turn the Powerhouse into residences, shops, galleries, and museum space.

Most of the proposals for retail and gallery space never materialized or found tenants, and as a result the eight blocks of industrial buildings remain much the same as in 2002 when the district began. As well, the city approved new zoning for a large development on First Street which deviated from the district plan.  New zoning is proposed for several other blocks. Most proposed developments are higher rise structures, and the majority of capital investment in the district favors high rise development. These factors led to WALDO being removed from the zoning ordinance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/15/nyregion/15towns.html|title=Adjusting Vision of Waterfront Arts District to Include High Rises|date=15 May 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=13 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Waldo Yards==
The term Waldo has been used before the zoning plan was introduced. Waldo Avenue is named for Samuel Waldo who built and owned three attached brownstone homes located on the NW corner of Magnolia and Waldo Avenues.  Today, the three structures still stand.The avenue which runs south from [[Newark Plank Road|Newark Avenue]] to "[[Hilltop, Jersey City|The Island]]" a remnant outcropping of [[Bergen Hill]], which in turn overlooks the Waldo Yards, originally used by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] [[Jersey City Branch]], and now by [[Port Authority Trans Hudson]] mass transit trains.

[[Image:Salvation Mountain 001.jpg|thumb|right|325px|Salvation Mountain.]]
'''Salvation Mountain''' is a hillside [[visionary environment]] created by local resident Leonard Knight (1931–2014) in the [[Deserts of California|California Desert]] area of [[Imperial County, California|Imperial County]], north of [[Calipatria, California|Calipatria]], northeast of [[Niland, California|Niland]] near [[Slab City]], and several miles from the [[Salton Sea]].

The artwork is made of [[adobe]], [[straw]], and thousands of gallons of lead-free [[paint]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivpressonline.com/news/local/leonard-knight-of-salvation-mountain-fame-dies-at/article_ceb43720-92b2-11e3-9d6f-001a4bcf6878.html Leonard Knight of Salvation Mountain fame dies at 82]&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses numerous murals and areas painted with [[Christianity|Christian sayings]] and Bible verses, though its philosophy was built around the [[Sinner's prayer|Sinner's Prayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tony |first=Perry |title=Salvation Mountain is missing its guiding spirit |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-salvation-20120226,0,4744945.story |accessdate=26 February 2012 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226233149/http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-salvation-20120226,0,4744945.story |archivedate=February 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Folk Art Society of America declared it "a folk art site worthy of preservation and protection"&lt;ref&gt;Larry Yust. [http://www.folkart.org/mag/leonard-knight "The Interactive Mountain of Leonard Knight"], "Folk Art Society of America"&lt;/ref&gt; in the year 2000. In an address to the [[United States Congress]] on May 15, 2002, California Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] described it as "a unique and visionary sculpture... a national treasure... profoundly strange and beautifully accessible, and worthy of the international acclaim it receives".&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Boxer. [http://beta.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/s4383-3/ "Leonard Knight and Salvation Mountain"], 107th Congress, 2nd Session
Issue: Vol. 148, No. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, the 80-year-old Knight was placed in a long-term care facility in [[El Cajon, California|El Cajon]] for dementia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mydesert.com/article/20140210/NEWS01/302100011/salvation-mountain-leonard-knight-niland The Desert Sun: Leonard Knight, father of Salvation Mountain, dies"] . accessed 02.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Knight died on February 10, 2014, in El Cajon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2014/02/leonard_knight_desert_cre.php L.A. Observed: "Leonard Knight, desert creator of Salvation Mountain was 82"] . accessed 02.11.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern has been raised for the future of the site, which requires constant maintenance due to the harsh surrounding environment. Many visitors bring paint to donate to the project, and a group of volunteers has been working to protect and maintain the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future Of Salvation Mountain Uncertain|publisher=KPBS.org|url=http://www.kpbs.org/news/2011/dec/20/future-salvation-mountain-uncertain/|accessdate=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Honore|first=Marcel|title=Who will save Salvation Mountain?|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mydesert/doc/1035031043.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug%2026,%202012&amp;author=&amp;pub=&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=|newspaper=The Desert Sun|date=August 12, 2012|location=Palm Springs, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Honore|first=Marcel|title=Return to Salvation Mountain|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mydesert/doc/1151330448.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov%2012,%202012&amp;author=&amp;pub=&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=|newspaper=The Desert Sun|date=November 12, 2012|location=Palm Springs, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a public charity, Salvation Mountain, Inc., was established to support the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nccsweb.urban.org/communityplatform/nccs/organization/profile/id/454106863/popup/1 Organizational Profile] – [[National Center for Charitable Statistics]] ([[Urban Institute]])&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Second Mountain ==
The current Salvation Mountain is actually the second construction to occupy the site;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of Salvation Mountain|url = http://www.salvationmountain.us/history.html|website = www.salvationmountain.us|accessdate = 2018-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight began the first Salvation Mountain in 1984, using highly unstable construction methods, allowing the mountain to collapse.

Knight was not discouraged; he rather saw it as God's way of letting him know the Mountain was not safe. He said he would start another Salvation Mountain (the current construction) "with more smarts".&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

== Paint toxicity concerns ==
In July, 1994, Imperial County hired a toxic waste specialist to test the soils around Salvation Mountain, with results showing high levels of lead toxicity.&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; Knight and his supporters gathered signatures for a second test to be done by an independent party of his choosing. That test came back negative, supporting Knight's claim that he used non-toxic paints and that there were no toxins in the soil.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== Formations ==
In 1998, Knight wanted to expand the mountain a bit. He gathered ideas from the Native Americans in the area around Salvation Mountain, which happen to be the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]]. The Navajo are known for their architectural expertise. Their [[Navajo pueblitos|pueblitos]] inspired Knight and he then began forming the [[Hogan]]. It is a dome-like structure made of adobe and straw that insulates from heat.&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = History of Salvation Mountain|url = http://www.salvationmountain.us/history2.html|website = www.salvationmountain.us|accessdate = 2015-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knight intended to live in it, though he always preferred to live in his truck.

Knight also began what he liked to call "the museum".&lt;ref name="history2"/&gt; It is modeled after a hot air balloon Knight tried to create before Salvation Mountain. He intended the balloon to be seen by all below it, as it stated "GOD IS LOVE" in bright red on a white fabric. This ideal carried over to Salvation Mountain. The museum is a semi dome structure in the mountain that contains several small items given to him by friends and visitors. Each item has a significance and more often than not, visitors seek out Salvation Mountain to pray and leave an item at the mountain as symbolism of giving themselves to God. The museum is held up by adobe and straw, but also by car parts and a tangle of trees that twist within the dome and reach through the top.

==Media appearances==
* [[Jarvis Cocker]] visited Salvation Mountain and interviewed Leonard Knight in 1999 for his three episode series on [[outsider art]] "Journeys Into The Outside With Jarvis Cocker".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aNeJ8hpRBs&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sensibility Objectified: The Sculptures of Sarbari Roy Choudhury''''' is a book by [[R. Siva Kumar]] that discusses the life and sculptures of [[Sarbari Roy Choudhury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Sensibility-Objectified-Scluptures-Sarbari-Choudhury/dp/1890206032|title=Sensibility Objectified: The Scupltures of Sarbari Roy Choudhury|first=Siva R.|last=Kumar|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Mapin Publishing Gp Pty Ltd|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to [[R. Siva kumar]] the 'sculptural sensibility' of [[Sarbari Roy Choudhury]], represented in his figurative and animated works, reveals the artist’s connection with the Indian traditions of sculpture, despite being strongly influenced by the West.

Some of Roy's best works are of classical musicians—[[Bade Ghulam Ali Khan]], [[Ali Akbar Khan]], [[Siddheshwari Devi]] and [[Kesarbai Kerkar]]. Starting from the 1950s, the monograph traces his work of each decade, revealing the artistic journey of one of India’s leading sculptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinpub.in/bookinfo.php?id=189#visit|title=Sensibility Objectified|website=mapinpub.in}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''statistically improbable phrase''' ('''SIP''') is a phrase or set of words that occurs more frequently in a document (or collection of documents) than in some larger [[Text corpus|corpus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs145/2011/wikipedia.pdf |title=SIPping Wikipedia |website=Courses.cms.caltech.edu |accessdate=2017-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.plagiarismtoday.com/2012/07/03/how-long-should-a-statistically-improbably-phrase-be/|title=How Long Should a Statistically Improbably Phrase Be?|author=Jonathan Bailey|date=3 July 2012|work=Plagiarism Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/26/11/1453|title=Identifying duplicate content using statistically improbable phrases|first1=Mounir|last1=Errami|first2=Zhaohui|last2=Sun|first3=Angela C.|last3=George|first4=Tara C.|last4=Long|first5=Michael A.|last5=Skinner|first6=Jonathan D.|last6=Wren|first7=Harold R.|last7=Garner|date=1 June 2010|publisher=|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=26|issue=11|pages=1453–1457|accessdate=1 January 2017|via=bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btq146|pmid=20472545|pmc=2872002}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amazon.com]] uses this concept in determining keywords for a given book or chapter, since keywords of a book or chapter are likely to appear disproportionately within that section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/search-inside/sipshelp.html|title=What are Statistically Improbable Phrases?|accessdate=2007-12-18|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/29/AR2005082901873.html|title=Amazon's Vital Statistics Show How Books Stack Up|last=Weeks|first=Linton|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 30, 2005|accessdate=September 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian Rudder]] has also used this concept with data from [[Online dating service|online dating profiles]] and [[Twitter]] posts to determine the phrases most characteristic of a given race or gender in his book ''Dataclysm''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rudder |first=Christian |date=2014 |title=Dataclysm: Who We Are When We Think No One's Looking |location=New York |publisher=Crown Publishers |page= |isbn=978-0-385-34737-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example== 
In a document about [[computer]]s, the most common word is likely to be the word "the," but since "the" is the most commonly used word in the English language, it is probable that any given document will have the word "the" used very frequently.  However, a phrase like "explicit Boolean algorithm" might occur in the document at a much higher rate than its average rate in the English language.  Hence, it is a phrase unlikely to occur in any given document, but ''did'' occur in the document given.  "Explicit Boolean algorithm" would be a statistically improbable phrase.

Statistically improbable phrases of Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' could be: ''temperate productions, genera descended, transitional gradations, unknown progenitor, fossiliferous formations, our domestic breeds, modified offspring, doubtful forms, closely allied forms, profitable variations, enormously remote, transitional grades, very distinct species'' and ''mongrel offspring''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://crookedtimber.org/2005/04/02/sociologically-improbable-phrases/ Sociologically Improbable Phrases] Crooked Timber April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10922">The '''Tagea Brandt ''Rejselegat'' (Travel Scholarship)''' is a Danish award to women who have made a significant contribution in science, literature or art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Legater_og_fonde/Tagea_Brandts_Rejselegat Denstoredanske.dk] The Grand Danish Encyclopedia, Tagea Brandts Rejselegat (''in Danish'')&lt;/ref&gt; The grant, which is given without application, was created and endowed by Danish industrialist [[Vilhelm Brandt]] (1854–1921) in 1905 in honor of his wife, [[Tagea Brandt]].
It is awarded annually on 17 March,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.litteraturpriser.dk/pris/tbrandt.htm Litteraturpriser.dk] Tagea Brandts Rejselegat&lt;/ref&gt; her birthday.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=tageabrandt|title=Tagea Brandt|publisher=|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The charter of 1922 provides that it shall be given to outstanding women in science, art, music, literature and theater arts (particularly in this case to actresses at the [[Royal Danish Theatre]]).&lt;ref name="kvbio"/&gt; The intent is for the awardee to both broaden her horizons while promoting Danish society abroad, and to benefit from vacation and rest time.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

The first scholarships were given in 1924; the first time the amount was DKK 10.000, in 1958 it was increased to DKK 15.000, in 1967 to 25.000, later to 50.000 and currently it is DKK 75.000, which usually is given to 2-3 women annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Samfund,_jura_og_politik/Samfund/Legater_og_fonde/Tagea_Brandts_Rejselegat Denstoredanske.dk]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ashland Academy of Art''' was an [[art school]] located in [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], [[Oregon]], [[United States]]. The Ashland Academy of Art was a classically based, independent school. The Academy's program was mainly based on the [[Russian Academic System]]. This system followed the artistic achievements of the [[Renaissance]], developed and practiced by European academies until the end of 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;The St. Petersburg State Academic Institute of 
Fine Arts, Sculpture and Architecture: [http://artroots.com/ra/index.html] Retrieved on 2008-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Ashland Academy of Art|first= Curtis|last= Hayden|publisher= ''[[The Sneak Preview]]'' |date= August 11, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ashland Academy's curriculum combined academic art education with the latest advancements in [[psychology]] of [[visual perception]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ashland Academy of Art: [https://web.archive.org/web/20030824052545/http://www.ashlandacademyofart.com/] Retrieved on 2008-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy's drawing curriculum was rooted in the Construction Method. This analytical method emphasizes a sculptural approach to form, by studying comparative measurements, structure, planes, function, and [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]].

==History==

Preserving the unique academic system of the classical European academies, [[Semyon Bilmes]], founded the Bilmes Art School in 1990 in [[Medford, Oregon]].  In 2003, Semyon Bilmes founded The Ashland Academy of Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Art School Takes Shape in Ashland|first= Chris|last= Abbey|publisher= ''[[Mail Tribune]]'' |date= November 21, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= A Standard for Art|first= Greg|last= Stiles|publisher= ''[[Mail Tribune]]'' |date= March 15, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Ashland Academy was listed as one of [[Art Renewal Center]] Approved Ateliers.&lt;ref&gt;The Art Renewal Center, [http://www.artrenewal.org/asp/database/atelier.asp?atelierID=88], 2008-10-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was located in the former Temple Emek Shalom synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.dailytidings.com/2003/news1009/100903n3.shtml |title= Academy goes back to basics |first= Tim |last= Bousquet |publisher= ''[[Ashland Daily Tidings]]'' |year= 2006 |accessdate= 2008-10-14 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20031126194440/http://www.dailytidings.com/2003/news1009/100903n3.shtml |archivedate= 2003-11-26 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, the Bilmes Family announced that the Ashland Academy of Art would close its doors in October 2010, with the faculty and some of the students relocating immediately to a then unspecified facility in Portland, Oregon, where the school's classes would continue, uninterrupted.

In February 2010, Semyon Bilmes announced that instead of moving to Portland, Oregon, he would relocate to Hawaii and take only ten students with him.  According to the Ashland Academy of art website, "With a new name and a new location, Atelier Maui will bring superior classical European instruction in painting and drawing to a lush tropical paradise."

'''The Eight Lancashire Lads''' was a troupe of young male [[Clog dance (British)|clog dancers]] who toured the [[music hall]]s of [[Great Britain]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

==Founders==
They were founded by Bill Cawley and J.W. (William) Jackson (1863–1940) of [[Wigan]], [[Lancashire]].  As they became more successful, they recruited other members such as [[Charlie Chaplin]], who got his first professional break with them at the age of ten.

==Former members==
* [[Charlie Chaplin]]
* [[Nat Jackley]]&lt;ref name="itsBehindYou"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bring on those Wonderful Dames! |url=http://www.its-behind-you.com/damesarticle.html#Nat%20Jackley |author= |publisher=It's Behind You |date= |accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ItsAHotun"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Manchunian Film Studio - The Stars |url=http://www.itsahotun.com/thestars.html |author= |publisher=it's a hot'un |date= |accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Brothers Richard, Eric and Clem White went to [[Sydney]], Australia in the 1910s and formed theatre companies including Edgley and Dawe. They had changed their names from White{{clarify|reason=Changed to what?|date=April 2018}} and the successful Australian theatrical empressarion [[Michael Edgley]] is descended from Eric Edgley. His brother, Richard White was for a period the choreographer of the female chorus at the [[New Tivoli Theatre, Sydney|Tivoli]] revue theatre in Sydney. Michael White (aka Wijaya) an exotic dancer and humorist, who has been resident in [[Bali]] since 1973, is Richard White's grandson.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

* Percy Joshua Norman (Pip) was also one the lads. He was in the troupe {{circa}} 1921. His wife Pat Norman is now 91 ({{as of|2013|3|16|lc=y}}) and living in Bradford. Also his son Chris Norman was in the band Smokie who had a lots of hits all over the world in the 1970s. Chris has had a solo career since the 1980s and is still touring and recording,{{when|date=April 2018}} he resides in the Isle of Man with his wife and family.

* Gabriel Winestein was another of the lads. Born in Leeds, Gabriel joined the troupe in about 1905.

'''''The Ludgate Monthly''''' was a London-based monthly magazine, which published short fiction and articles of general interest. There were 118 issues from May 1891 to February 1901; the magazine then merged with [[The Universal Magazine (1900 monthly)|''The Universal Magazine'']].

The magazine was published from May 1891 to October 1893 under the title ''The Ludgate Monthly'' for 30 issues, from November 1893 to October 1895 under the title ''The Ludgate Illustrated Magazine'' for 24 issues, from November 1895 to February 1901 under the title ''The Ludgate'' for 64 issues, and was then merged into ''The Universal Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsp.com/data/data271.html The Ludgate Monthly, Magazine Data, philsp.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Universal and Ludgate Magazine|journal=The Bookseller|date=8 February 1901|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SkXQAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ludgate Weekly'' was a spinoff magazine which lasted less than a year (from 5 March to 1 October 1892); the first issue of this weekly had a Conan Doyle story [https://books.google.com/books?id=ieJxCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA294 ''The Great Brown-Pericord Motor''].&lt;ref name="SFEncyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ludgate_monthly_the Culture : Ludgate Monthly, The : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tradigital art''' is [[art]] (including [[animation]]) that combines both traditional and computer-based techniques to create an image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/tradigital.asp WordSpy entry] for ''tradigital''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Unique.jpg|right|thumb|Unique Editions&lt;br&gt;top, left to right: [[Bonny Lhotka]], Judith Moncrieff;&lt;br&gt;bottom, left to right: Dorothy Krause, Karin Schminke, Helen Golden]]
Artist and teacher [[Judith Moncrieff]] first coined the term. In the early 1990s, while an instructor at the [[Pacific Northwest College of Art]], Moncrieff invented and taught a new digital medium called "Tradigital". The school held a competition between Moncrieff's students, who used the medium to electronically combine everything from photographs of costumes to stills from videotapes of performing dancers.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Gragg, "Art students get a crack at 'Nutcracker'," ''Portland Oregonian'', October 25, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"&gt;Lisa Wray, [http://www.lisawrayart.com/index.htm ''Judith Montcrieff, Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713212916/http://www.lisawrayart.com/index.htm |date=2011-07-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Moncrieff also referred to her business entity (formerly "Moncrieff Studios") as "Tradigital Imaging" around the same period.

Moncrieff was one of five founding members of the digital art collective called "Unique Editions". These five artists—Helen Golden, [[Bonny Lhotka]], Dorothy Krause,&lt;ref&gt;William Zimmer, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D07E5DD1339F93BA25751C0A960958260 "ART;A Family and Its Gallery Click on the Future"], ''The New York Times'', February 18, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; Judith Moncrieff, and Karin Schminke—combined their expertise in traditional studio media and techniques with [[digital imaging]] to produce original fine art and editions. The artists met in June, 1994, at "Beyond the Digital Print", a workshop organized by Krause at [[Massachusetts College of Art and Design]] in Boston. The artists' varied backgrounds are evident in their mixed media approach to using the computer as an art-making tool. Although every image is conceived and executed at least in part on the computer, the range of work includes one of a kind paintings, collages, Polaroid and image transfers, monotypes and prints on such varied substrates as canvas, handmade paper, and embossed metal. Moncrieff used the term "Tradigital media" to describe this merging of traditional and digital tools and "tradigitalism" as a name for this emerging movement. Unique Editions also served as a research and public relations entity for exploring technologies and promoting digital art. The group forged links with hardware and software developers in an effort to provide feedback on their products from the artist's perspective. It served as a demonstration to the rest of the art world of the role of digital technologies in the artist's studio. Unique Editions became inactive in 1997; however, Golden and Moncrieff continued to work together under the name, "Tradigital Fine Art".&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"/&gt;

Independently in the early 1990s, artist [[Lisa Wray]] was developing the fine art style she calls "Renaissance of Metaphysical Imagery". Prototypes were made for each work from color copies, color photos or film negatives made in her graphic arts darkroom. In 1990, she visited the only two places in the country with proprietary computer systems capable of assembling her prototypes: Raphael Digital Transparencies in Houston Texas, and Dodge Color Laboratories in Washington D.C. The first two prototypes, Brew of Life and Fantasy, were assembled by Dodge Color Laboratories on a Superset machine that was first developed by the Department of Defense. The final art was archived on 1" magnetic tape, and then output as an 11x14” color film transparency. Lisa discovered Judith Montcrieff and her pioneering efforts with Unique Editions and Tradigital Fine Art, in the early 1990s, found the term, "Tradigital", and also used the term to describe her own work.&lt;ref name="lisawrayart.com"/&gt;

==Other uses of the term==
Since then, use of the term has greatly expanded to include other art forms.

In 2002, "tradigital" went mainstream when [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] used the term '''tradigital animation''' to refer to the blending of computer animation with classical [[cell animation]] techniques, "a seamless blend of two-dimensional and three-dimensional animation techniques".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Doherty, [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=106FA0A1A27D07B8&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "Sense and Cinematography"], ''The Boston Globe'', Dec 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned as examples such animation films as ''[[Toy Story]]'', ''[[Antz]]'', ''[[Shrek]]'', ''[[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]]'', and ''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Kehr, [http://movies.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?res=9A04E6DE1F38F937A15756C0A9649C8B63 "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron"], ''The New York Times'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Canemaker, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E0DC1430F931A25756C0A9649C8B63 "SUMMER MOVIES; Flat Worlders Face the Horizon and See It's in 3-D"], ''The New York Times'', May 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jane Horwitz, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A2169-2002May23 Stallion vs. Iron Horse: A Galloping Good Tale], ''The Washington Post'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Todd Leopold, [http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/22/ca.s02.spirit.katzenberg/index.html "The 'Spirit' of a movie mogul"], ''CNN'', May 22, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nina Rehfeld, [https://www.welt.de/print-wams/article104216/Die_Zukunft_der_Maerchen.html "Die Zukunft der Märchen"], ''Die Welt'', Dec. 1, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Moore, "The 'Spirit' of Jeffrey Katzenberg," ''The Orlando Sentinel'', May 24, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that [[Walt Disney]] (a [[traditional art]] animator) would approve of the changes in the way cartoons are made today. Animation World Magazine&lt;ref&gt;Sylvia Edwards, [http://www.awn.com/mag/issue6.01/6.01pages/edwardstelevision.php3 "Tradigital Television: Digital Tools and Saturday Morning"], ''Animation World Magazine'', Issue 6.01, April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; describes '''tradigital television''', and the impact of tradigital animation on pre- and post-production processes for television shows.

'''Tradigital printing''' is an experimental approach to [[printmaking]] with contemporary technology. In one form of tradigital printing, printmakers use computers to generate positives for UV photo transfer to plates and screens. In another form, digital print output incorporating [[silkscreen]], relief or [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] techniques is the focus. For example, the Josephine Press&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Press, [http://www.josephinepress.com/tradigital.html ''Tradigital Printmaking''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080630045035/http://www.josephinepress.com/tradigital.html |date=2008-06-30 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; uses a process that combines the use of archival digital prints with traditional techniques such as intaglio, [[woodcut]]s, [[lithograph]]s, and all of the other traditional printmaking methods. The process allows the artist to create a multi-color image without using a four-plate process. In addition to more efficient registration, the artist can work with collage and other mixed media works that can be scanned and reproduced in an archival manner. Tradigital printing greatly expands the possibilities of image-making while still producing an original hand pulled, limited edition, fine art print.

A recent Wall Street Journal article hailed '''tradigital creatives''' as the "voice of tomorrow",&lt;ref&gt;Manish Sinha, [http://www.livemint.com/2008/08/14151616/Web-Exclusive--Creativity-in.html "Creativity in tradigital times"], The Wall Street Journal, Aug 14 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; contrasting them with both "traditionalists" and "digitalists", and identifying several distinguishing characteristics of the new art/marketing medium: voices not eyeballs; experience not messages; community not communication; utility and solutions not cleverness; collaborative not silo thinkers.

The genre of '''travel literature''' encompasses [[outdoor literature]], [[guide book]]s, [[nature writing]], and travel [[memoir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cuddon, J. A. |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |date=1999 |page=937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One early travel memoirist in [[Western literature]] was [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a Greek geographer of the 2nd century AD. In the [[early modern period]], [[James Boswell]]'s ''Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides'' (1786) helped shape travel memoir as a genre.

==History==
[[File:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Handwritten notes by [[Christopher Columbus]] on the Latin edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Il Milione'']]
{{further|The Travels of Marco Polo}}
Early examples of travel literature include [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' ''Description of Greece'' in the 2nd century CE, the ''[[Itinerarium Cambriae|Journey Through Wales]]'' (1191) and ''[[Descriptio Cambriae|Description of Wales]]'' (1194) by [[Gerald of Wales]], and the travel journals of [[Ibn Jubayr]] (1145&amp;ndash;1214) and [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304&amp;ndash;1377), both of whom recorded their travels across the known world in detail. The travel genre was a fairly common genre in medieval [[Arabic literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travel Genre in Arabic Literature: A Selective Literary and Historical Study|first=Fathi A.|last=El-Shihibi|publisher=Dissertation.com|location=Boca Raton, Fla|year=2006|isbn=1-58112-326-4|type=Originally presented as the author's thesis (Ph.D.--Boston University, 1998)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel literature became popular during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) of medieval China.&lt;ref name="hargett 67"&gt;Hargett 1985, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in [[narrative]], [[prose]], [[essay]] and [[diary]] style.&lt;ref name="hargett 67 93"&gt;Hargett 1985, pp. 67–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel literature authors such as [[Fan Chengda]] (1126–1193) and [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of [[geographical]] and [[topographical]] information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' ''[[Su Shi#Travel record literature|Record of Stone Bell Mountain]]'' by the noted poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.&lt;ref name="hargett 74 76"&gt;Hargett 1985, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest known records of taking pleasure in travel, of travelling for the sake of travel and writing about it, is [[Francesco Petrarch|Petrarch]]'s (1304&amp;ndash;1374) ascent of [[Mount Ventoux]] in 1336. He states that he went to the mountaintop for the pleasure of seeing the top of the famous height. His companions who stayed at the bottom he called ''frigida incuriositas'' ("a cold lack of curiosity"). He then wrote about his climb, making [[Medieval allegory|allegorical]] comparisons between climbing the mountain and his own moral progress in life.

Michault Taillevent, a poet for the [[Duke of Burgundy]], travelled through the [[Jura Mountains]] in 1430 and recorded his personal reflections, his horrified reaction to the sheer rock faces, and the terrifying thunderous cascades of mountain streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yqsIYSNmLMC&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Un poète bourguignon du XVe siècle, Michault Taillevent: édition et étude | publisher=Librairie Droz |author1=Deschaux, Robert |author2=Taillevent, Michault | year=1975 | pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Antoine de la Sale]] (c. 1388&amp;ndash;c. 1462), author of ''Petit Jehan de Saintre'', climbed to the crater of a volcano in the [[Lipari Islands]] in 1407, leaving us with his impressions. "Councils of mad youth" were his stated reasons for going. In the mid-15th century, Gilles le Bouvier, in his ''Livre de la description des pays'', gave us his reason to travel and write:
:Because many people of diverse nations and countries delight and take pleasure, as I have done in times past, in seeing the world and things therein, and also because many wish to know without going there, and others wish to see, go, and travel, I have begun this little book.

In 1589, [[Richard Hakluyt]] (c. 1552&amp;ndash;1616) published ''Voyages'', a foundational text of the travel literature genre.

In the 18th Century, travel literature was commonly known as the book of travels, which mainly consisted of maritime [[diary|diaries]].&lt;ref name="stolley 26"&gt;Stolley 1992, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 18th century Britain, almost every famous writer worked in the travel literature form.&lt;ref name="fussell 54"&gt;Fussell 1963, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Captain James Cook]]'s diaries (1784) were the equivalent of today's best sellers&lt;ref&gt;Glyndwr Williams, ''Captain Cook's Voyages: 1768–1779''. London: The Folio Society, 1997, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America, during the years 1799–1804'', originally published in French, was translated to multiple languages and influenced later naturalists, including [[Charles Darwin]].

Other later examples of travel literature include accounts of the [[Grand Tour]]. Aristocrats, clergy, and others with money and leisure time travelled Europe to learn about the art and architecture of its past. One tourism literature pioneer was [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (1850&amp;ndash;1894), with ''[[An Inland Voyage]]'' (1878), and  ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879) about his travels in the [[Cévennes]], (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first [[sleeping bag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Travel books==
{{further|List of travel books}}

Travel books come in styles ranging from the [[documentary]], to the literary, as well as the journalistic, and from the humorous to the serious. They are often associated with [[tourism]] and include [[guide book]]s. Travel writing may be found on web sites, in periodicals, and in books. It has been produced by a variety of writers, including travelers, military officers, missionaries, explorers, scientists, pilgrims, social and physical scientists, educators, and migrants. Englishmen [[Eric Newby]],&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[[Margalit Fox]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/24/obituaries/24newby.html "Eric Newby, 86, Acclaimed British Travel Writer, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 october 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[H. V. Morton]], the Americans [[Bill Bryson]] and [[Paul Theroux]], and [[Wales|Welsh]] author [[Jan Morris]] are or were widely acclaimed as travel writers (though Morris has frequently claimed herself as a writer of 'place' rather than travel ''per se'').{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bill Bryson in 2011 won the Golden Eagle Award from the Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.owpg.org.uk/2011/08/bill-bryson-wins-prestigious-golden-eagle-award/&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2012, Durham University officially renamed the [[Durham University Library|Main Library]] the Bill Bryson Library for his contributions as the university's 11th chancellor (2005–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Main Library is being renamed 'The Bill Bryson Library'!|date=2012-09-25|work=[[Durham University]]|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/news/?itemno=15355|accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Bryson Library renaming event, Tuesday 27 November 2012|date=2012-11-22|work=[[Durham University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Theroux was awarded the 1981 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for his novel ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'', which was adapted for the 1986 movie of the same name. He was also awarded in 1989 the [[Thomas Cook Travel Book Award]]  for ''Riding the Iron Rooster''. In 2005, Jan Morris was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] by [[English PEN]] for "a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |date= |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Traveling Genius: The Writing Life of Jan Morris |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHMEVRxWx6UC&amp;pg=PR20 |author=Gillian Fenwick |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |chapter=Chronology |page=XX |year=2008 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel literature often intersects with [[essay]] writing, as in [[V. S. Naipaul]]'s ''[[India: A Wounded Civilization]]'' (1976), whose trip became the occasion for extended observations on a nation and people. This is similarly the case in [[Rebecca West]]'s work on Yugoslavia, ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]'' (1941).&lt;ref&gt;West, Rebecca, intr. Geoff Dyer, (2006). ''Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia''. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a writer will settle into a locality for an extended period, absorbing a sense of place while continuing to observe with a travel writer's sensibility. Examples of such writings include [[Lawrence Durrell]]'s ''[[Bitter Lemons]]'' (1957), [[Deborah Tall]]'s ''The Island of the White Cow: Memories of an Irish Island'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Gross, "'White Cow` Absorbing Account Of Irish Island The Island Of The White Cow: Memories Of An Irish Island. By Deborah Tall". March 2, 1986, ''News/Sun-Sentinel''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Mayle]]'s best-selling ''[[A Year in Provence]]'' (1989) and its sequels.

Travel and nature writing merge in many of the works by [[Sally Carrighar]], [[Gerald Durrell]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]]. Sally Carrighar's works include ''One Day at Teton Marsh'' (1965), ''Home to the Wilderness'' (1973), and ''Wild Heritage'' (1965). [[Gerald Durrell]]'s ''[[My Family and Other Animals]]'' (1956) is an autobiographical work by the British naturalist. It tells of the years that he lived as a child with his siblings and widowed mother on the Greek island of [[Corfu]] between 1935 and 1939. It describes the life of the Durrell family in a humorous manner, and explores the fauna of the island. It is the first and most well-known of Durrell's "Corfu trilogy", together with ''[[Birds, Beasts, and Relatives]]'' and ''[[The Garden of the Gods]]'' (1978). [[Ivan T. Sanderson]] published ''Animal Treasure'', a report of an expedition to the jungles of then-British West Africa; ''Caribbean Treasure'', an account of an expedition to [[Trinidad]], [[Haiti]], and [[Surinam]], begun in late 1936 and ending in late 1938; and ''Living Treasure'', an account of an expedition to [[Jamaica]], British Honduras (now [[Belize]]) and the [[Yucatán]]. These authors are [[natural history|naturalists]], who write in support of their fields of study. Another naturalist, [[Charles Darwin]], wrote his famous account of the journey of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] at the intersection of science, natural history and travel.&lt;ref&gt;"Review of Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle between the Years 1826 and 1836 ... &amp; Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the various Countries visited by H.M.S. Beagle ...". ''The Quarterly Review''. 65: 194–234. December 1839.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of writers famous in other fields have written about their travel experiences. Examples are [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland'' (1775); [[Charles Dickens]]' ''American Notes for General Circulation'' (1842); [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' (1796); [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''The Path To Rome'' (1902); [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''Twilight in Italy and Other Essays'' (1916); ''Mornings in Mexico and Other Essays'' (1927); [[Rebecca West]]'s ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]'' (1941); and [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Travels with Charley: In Search of America]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2011/04/04/sorry-charley "Sorry, Charley"], Bill Steigerwald, ''Reason'', April 2011 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/books/steinbecks-travels-with-charley-gets-a-fact-checking.html "A Reality Check for Steinbeck and Charley"], Charles McGrath, ''New York Times'', April 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adventure literature==
In the world of sailing [[Joshua Slocum]]'s ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'' (1900) is a classic of outdoor adventure literature.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Slocum Society: [http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1895, [[Joshua Slocum]] set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and in  ''Sailing Alone Around the World'',&lt;ref name=SailingAlone&gt;Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''&lt;/ref&gt; he described his departure in the following manner:

:I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. ... A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.

More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, Slocum returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world.

==Guide books==
{{main|Guide book}}
[[Image:Claife Station.jpg|right|thumb|Claife Station, built at one of [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s 'viewing stations', to allow visiting tourists and artists to better appreciate the [[picturesque]] English [[Lake District]].]]
A '''guide book''' or '''travel guide''' is "a book of information about a place, designed for the use of visitors or tourists".&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s guide to the [[Lake District]], published in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas West, (1821) [1778]. ''A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire''. Kendal: W. Pennington.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]], an English [[priest]], popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the [[Lake District]] of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed: &lt;blockquote&gt;to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.&lt;ref name=West2&gt;{{cite book |last=West |title=A Guide to the Lakes |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name=development&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |title=Development of tourism in the Lake District National Park |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District UK |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011064752/http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published in 1778 the book was a major success.&lt;ref name=NPA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |title=Understanding the National Park &amp;mdash; Viewing Stations |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District National Park Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212541/http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |archivedate=2014-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It will usually include full details relating to accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are also often included. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from [[adventure travel]] to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet. Travel guides can also take the form of [[travel website]]s.

==Travel journals==
[[File:Goethe's Italian Journey.png|thumb|upright|Goethe's Italian Journey between September 1786 and May 1788]]
A travel journal, also called road journal, is a record made by a traveller, sometimes in diary form, of the traveler's experiences, written during the course of the journey and later edited for publication. This is a long-established literary format; an early example is the writing of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2nd century AD) who produced his ''Description of Greece'' based on his own observations. [[James Boswell]] published his ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' in 1786 and [[Goethe]] published his ''[[Italian Journey]]'', based on diaries, in 1816. [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calderón de la Barca|Fannie Calderón de la Barca]], the Scottish-born wife of the Spanish ambassador to Mexico 1839–1842, wrote ''[[Life in Mexico]]'', an important travel narrative of her time there, with many observations of local life. A British traveller, [[Mrs Alec Tweedie]], published a number of travelogues, ranging from Denmark (1895) and Finland (1897), to the U.S. (1913), several on Mexico (1901, 1906, 1917), and one on Russia, Siberia, and China (1926). A more recent example is [[Che Guevara]]'s ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]''. A travelogue is a [[Travelogue (films)|film]], book written up from a travel diary, or illustrated talk describing the experiences of and places visited by traveller.&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; American writer [[Paul Theroux]] has published many works of travel literature, the first success being ''[[The Great Railway Bazaar]]''.  Anglo-American [[Bill Bryson]] is known for ''[[A Walk in the Woods (book)|A Walk in the Woods]]'', made into a Hollywood [[A Walk in the Woods (film)|film of the same name]].&lt;ref name="variety.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=‘99 Homes,’ ‘A Walk in the Woods’ Set for September Releases|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/99-homes-a-walk-in-the-woods-release-date-broad-green-1201468864/|accessdate=April 9, 2015|work=variety.com|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
Some fictional travel stories are related to travel literature. Although it may be desirable in some contexts to distinguish [[fiction]]al from [[non-fiction]]al works, such distinctions have proved notoriously difficult to make in practice, as in the famous instance of the travel writings of [[Marco Polo]] or [[John Mandeville]]. Examples of fictional works of travel literature based on actual journeys are: 
* [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), which has its origin in an actual voyage Conrad made up the [[River Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conrad, Joseph &amp; Zdzisław Najder (Editor)|title=The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces| date= 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' (1958) are fictionalized accounts of his travels across the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s
*Travel writer [[Kira Salak]]'s novel, ''[[The White Mary]]'' (2008), a contemporary example of a real life journey transformed into a work of fiction, which takes place in [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].&lt;ref name=NatGeoWhiteMary&gt;{{cite web|last=Finkel[[Michael Finkel|Finkel]]|first= Michael|title=Kira Salek: The White Mary|url=http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/2008/08/kira-salak/michael-finkel-text|work=National Geographic Adventure|accessdate=12 November 2010|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WallStreetWhiteMary&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121702303930685891?mod=2_1167_1 |title=Imaginary Journey |work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Jeffrey A. | last=Trachtenberg | date=26 July 2008|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazon_entryWhiteMary&gt;{{cite web |title=The White Mary: A Novel|work=Amazon.com|isbn=0805088474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel blogs==
In the 21st century, travel literature became a genre of [[social media]] in the form of travel blogs, with travel bloggers using outlets like personal [[blog]]s, [[Pinterest]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] to convey information about their adventures, and provide advice for navigating particular countries, or for traveling generally.&lt;ref name="TJEPIC"&gt;F. Hanusch, E. Fürsich, ''Travel Journalism: Exploring Production, Impact and Culture'' (2014), p. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel blogs were among the first instances of blogging, which began in the mid 1990s.&lt;ref name="TJEPIC"/&gt;. In 2018 the most popular self hosted blogging platform is [[WordPress]], due to its ease of use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-blogging-platform/|title=How to Choose the Best Blogging Platform in 2018 (Compared)|date=2016-11-10|work=WPBeginner|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Scholarship==

&lt;!--this whole section smells of [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:POV]]; needs either rewrite or thorough citations--&gt;
The systematic study of travel literature emerged as a field of scholarly inquiry in the mid-1990s, with its own conferences, organizations, journals, monographs, anthologies, and encyclopedias.  Important, pre-1995 monographs are: ''Abroad'' (1980) by [[Paul Fussell]], an [[exploration]] of British interwar travel writing as escapism; ''Gone Primitive: Modern Intellects, Savage Minds'' (1990) by Marianna Torgovnick, an inquiry into the [[primitivism|primitivist]] presentations of foreign cultures; ''Haunted Journeys: Desire and Transgression in European Travel Writing'' (1991) by Dennis Porter, a close look at the psychological correlatives of travel; ''Discourses of Difference: An Analysis of Women's Travel Writing'' by Sara Mills, an inquiry into the intersection of gender and [[colonialism]] during the 19th century; ''Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation'' (1992), [[Mary Louise Pratt]]'s influential study of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] travel writing's dissemination of a colonial mind-set; and ''Belated Travelers'' (1994), an analysis of colonial anxiety by Ali Behdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29468460|title=Belated travelers : orientalism in the age of colonial dissolution|last=Behdad|first=Ali|date=1994|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=0822314711|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=|oclc=29468460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Disrupting the assumptions of traditional travel writing, Amitav Ghosh's ''In an Antique Land'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29428387|title=In an antique land|last=Ghosh|first=Amitav|date=1994|publisher=|year=|isbn=0679727833|edition=|location=New York|pages=|oclc=29428387}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be regarded as an example of "counter travel narrative", reversing the "roles of traveller and local, viewing the present as contextualized by the colonial and precolonial past, and eschewing definitive authorial authority [in] a powerful rebuttal to the ideology of the traditional travel text."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McParland|first=Liam|date=2017|title=Egypt, India, ideology: In an antique land as a rebuttal to the traditional travel text|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10613/5430|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=VIUSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel awards==

Prizes awarded annually for travel books have included the [[Thomas Cook Travel Book Award]], which ran from 1980 to 2004, the  [[Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature]], and the [[Dolman Best Travel Book Award]], which began in 2006. The [[North American Travel Journalists Association]] holds an annual awards competition honoring travel journalism in a multitude of categories, ranging across print and online media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://natja.memberclicks.net/competition-guidelines|title=Competition Rules and Guidelines|last=Leon|first=Yanira|website=natja.memberclicks.net|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trick roping''' is an entertainment or competitive art involving the spinning of a [[lasso]] also known as a lariat or a "rope."  It is particularly associated with [[Wild West Shows|wild west shows]] or western arts in the United States.

The lasso is a well-known tool of American [[cowboy]]s, who developed rope spinning and throwing skills in using lassos to catch animals. Cowboys developed various tricks to show off their prowess with the lasso and demonstrations of these tricks evolved into entertainment and competitive disciplines.

There is a well-established repertoire of tricks that can be divided into three fundamental categories: "flat loop", "vertical loop" and "butterfly". In addition there are thrown loop tricks and tricks that involve the use of two ropes. Among the vertical loop tricks is the "Texas Skip", which involves the performer spinning the lasso in a wide loop in a vertical plane and jumping through the loop from one side to the other on each rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Well-known trick ropers include:

*[[Montie Montana]], who had a 60-year career as a trick roper, also appeared in several [[John Wayne]] movies.

*Actor and humorist [[Will Rogers]], known for his roles as a cowboy, was an expert at trick roping. Rogers' rope tricks were showcased in the 1922 silent film "The Ropin' Fool."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = The Ropin' Fool|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124857/|date = 1922-10-29|accessdate = 2016-02-23|first = Clarence G.|last = Badger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Vince Bruce, born April 4, 1955, died September 24, 2011: Internationally acclaimed as one of the best western acts in the world, Bruce made his Broadway debut in 1991, in the Tony Award-winning musical ''The Will Rogers Follies — A Life in Revue''. Appearing as the trick-roping star and portraying Rogers in this tribute to the cowboy and vaudeville star, Bruce remained with the show for two and a half years at New York’s Palace Theatre. For his act, he performed a spin with two ropes, a feat first devised 60 years earlier by Will Rogers himself. On July 21, 1991, at the Empire State Building, Vince set a new world record — 4,011 — for “Texas Skips”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Vince Bruce - Obituaries|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8818953/Vince-Bruce.html|accessdate=29 December 2017|agency=The Telegraph|date=10 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56903">[[File:Josephine Baker 1950.jpg|thumb|right|[[Josephine Baker]] in 1950]]
A '''''vedette''''' is the main female artist of a show derived from [[cabaret]] and its genres ([[revue]], [[vaudeville]], [[music hall]] or [[burlesque]]). 

The purpose of the vedette in a cabaret or nightclub show is to entertain the public. The vedette has to know how to [[triple threat (entertainer)|sing, dance and act]] on stage. Depending on the quality of its show, career or mastery of one or more stage talents, can be considered a ''super vedette'' or ''first vedette''. Generally a vedette is a woman with physical presence, personality and charisma that captivates the public. In addition to singing, dancing and acting, vedettes often included groups of dancers, flashy and revealing costumes, magicians, comedians, jugglers, and even performing animals. Vedettes specializing in burlesque generally do striptease and may also perform nude on stage.

In the 20th century, vedette shows were successful in the cabarets, theaters and nightclubs of countries such as [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Argentina]] and [[Mexico]]. [[Paris]] and [[Las Vegas]] were considered the main cradle of the vedettes.

==Etymology==
''Vedette'' is a French word originally used to designate an artist of great fame and notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.le-dictionnaire.com/definition.php?mot=vedette|title=Le Dictionnaire - Définition vedette|website=www.le-dictionnaire.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term underwent changes over the years. From the early twentieth century, it began to be used to designate the main female artists of the shows of a cabaret such as burlesque, vaudeville, music hall or revue. The zenith of fame and popularity of these women coincided with various historical moments of 20th century sexual liberation: the 1920s, 1940s and 1970s.

The vedettes began their rise in popularity in France at the beginning of the 20th century. After France, they have gained greater popularity in Latin countries, both in Europe (Spain) and North and South America (Argentina and Mexico), where they caused a furor in the nightlife at different times. The term is little used in Anglo-Saxon countries, although in the United States there are very popular shows of cabaret and burlesque in the city of Las Vegas, where it is often confused with  so-called [[showgirl]]s. Venues such as [[Le Lido]], the [[Moulin Rouge]], and the [[Crazy Horse]] in France. The [[Teatro Maipo]] and the [[Teatro El Nacional]] in Argentina, and the [[Teatro de la Ciudad |Teatro de la Ciudad "Esperanza Iris"]] in Mexico are or were famous for their vedette shows.

==Europe==

===France===
[[File:Le Lido.jpg|thumb|right|[[Le Lido]] of Paris]]
France is considered the cradle of vedettes worldwide. Its capital, [[Paris]], has been home to some of the most famous cabarets in the world. Among these are the [[Moulin Rouge]] and the [[Folies Bergère de Paris]], pioneers of night shows in which the vedettes appeared on the scene half naked and doing [[Tableau vivant]]. Other famous venues are the [[Le Lido]] and [[Bataclan (theatre)|Bataclan]], also famous for their vaudeville and Revues. In more recent times, this group of entertainment centers would be joined by [[Crazy Horse (cabaret)|Crazy Horse]].

Among the main vedettes of France are considered the "Three Graces" of Belle Époque: [[Émilienne d'Alençon]], [[Liane de Pougy]], and [[La Bella Otero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardianpromenade.com/sex/the-courtesan/|title=The Courtesan|date=14 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famous [[Mistinguett]] became one of the most popular French artists of her time and the most important woman in the world of the spectacle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/m/mistinguett.htm|title=Biografia de Mistinguett|website=www.biografiasyvidas.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Madame Rasimi is remembered as the founder of the Bataclan. Another outstanding figure was [[Gina Palerme]].

At the beginning of the century, the novelist [[Colette]] was also distinguished by acting in shows of magazine. Another prominent figure at that time is the world-famous Dutch spy [[Mata Hari]].

The legendary [[Cléo de Mérode]] of the Folies Bergère was another of the great stars of the Parisian nightlife of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.portalsolidario.net/ocio/visu/biografia.php?rowid=10182|title=Biografía insólita. Cleo de Mérode, la bailarina más deseada|website=www.portalsolidario.net|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mistinguett Moulin Rouge.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mistinguett]] at the [[Moulin Rouge]]]]

[[Joséphine Baker]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cmgww.com/stars/baker/about/biography.html|title=Biography - The Official Licensing Website of Josephine Baker|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[United States|American]] origin, is remembered as one of the most important vedettes of the twentieth century. Her "Revue Nègre", which included a [[jazz]] orchestra, caused a sensation in the Parisian cabarets. Her exotic dance form, her uninhibited sexuality and her minimal dress (which included a skirt made with bananas) were more attractive to [[Europe]]ans than to [[United States|Americans]]. She became the star of Parisian nights and even opened her own club, Chez ''Josephine''.

Another important figure was [[Coccinelle]], considered the first transsexual vedette in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww38.coccinelleshow.com/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20161228073700/http://ww38.coccinelleshow.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=28 December 2016|title=''Biography of Coccinelle in her official web page''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The actress and singer [[Liliane Montevecchi]] stood out as vedette in the Folies Bergère in the 1970s, and eventually conquered [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Another figure of the time was the Italian Xenia Monty.

In recent times the vedette shows emphasize figures like [[Arielle Dombasle]] (known as the vedette-like Dolorès Sugar Rose) and Marlène Mourreau.

The image of the Vedette in Mexico arises from the beginning of the 20th century with the rise of the called "Carpas" and the [[Revue]]s. Some venues such as Teatro Principal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museoebc.org/eventos/historia-del-teatro-principal-en-mexico-1753-1931|title=Historia del Teatro Principal en México 1753-1931 - Museo EBC|website=museoebc.org|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Teatro Colón&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2007/08/20/opinion/o-01802.htm|title=El Teatro Colón, en el D.F. de México|last=Clarín.com|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Teatro Arbeu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciudadanosenred.com.mx/el-teatro-arbeu/|title=EL TEATRO ARBEU - Ciudadanos en Red|date=2 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were considered as the cathedral of the revues and burlesque in [[Mexico City]]. There arise figures like [[Lupe Vélez]], who, before being consecrated as a star in [[Hollywood]], was considered one of the queens of the frivolous theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcguionistas.com/noticias/guion/11111111111111111111111111111113ek/martin-caballero-presenta-su-biopic-sobre-lupe-velez.html|title=Martín Caballero presenta su 'biopic' sobre Lupe Vélez|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum figure of the time was [[Maria Conesa]] "The White Kitten", who also had a very long career spanning theater, film and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maria-conesa-tiple.blogspot.com/|title=María Conesa: La artista, la mujer y el mito|first=Roberto|last=Acuña|date=8 August 2011|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other outstanding figures of the time were Esperanza Iris,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/i/iris.htm|title=Biografia de Esperanza Iris|website=www.biografiasyvidas.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celia Montalván,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinesilentemexicano.wordpress.com/2009/10/14/l/|title=Las tiples y el cine mudo|date=14 October 2009|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lupe Rivas Cacho,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miguelangelmoralex-comicos.blogspot.com/2011/07/lupe-rivas-cacho.html|title=LUPE RIVAS CACHO|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amparo Arozamena]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/595081.html|title=El Universal -  - Perfil: María Amparo Arozamena Sánchez|first=|last=|website=www.eluniversal.com.mx|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prudencia Grifell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistaactual.com.mx/2011/06/prudencia-griffel-41-aniversario-luctuoso/Article|title=about Prudencia Griffel|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Celia Padilla,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://es.pinterest.com/pin/409264684861728019/|title=TEATRO MEXICANO|website=Pinterest|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Delia Magaña]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museocjv.com/deliamagana.htm|title=Museo CJV|website=www.museocjv.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lupe Inclán, Aurora Walker, Amelia Wilhelmy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reliquiasideologicas.blogspot.com/2010/01/w.html|title=Reliquias Ideológicas: W|date=1 April 2010|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mimí Derba]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revistaactual.com.mx/2011/07/mimi-derba-58-aniversario-luctuoso/|title=Article about Mimí Derba|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213110942/http://revistaactual.com.mx/2011/07/mimi-derba-58-aniversario-luctuoso/#|archive-date=2013-12-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. Conesa, Montalván and Rivas Cacho, were even immortalized in a famous [[foxtrot]] called ''Mi querido capitán (My dear captain)''.


In the 1950s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/1090805/0/eujenia-arenas/cabarets/mexico/|title=Los últimos cabarets mexicanos|last=20Minutos|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|date=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; saw a resurgence of nightlife in Mexico City. Venues like the Tivoli, the Waikikí, the Margo (after the Teatro Blanquita), the Follies Bergere and the Teatro Lírico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.urban360.com.mx/239792/por-las-calles-de-la-ciudad-teatro-lirico/|title=''Article about the Teatro Lírico''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003224958/http://news.urban360.com.mx/239792/por-las-calles-de-la-ciudad-teatro-lirico/#|archive-date=2017-10-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others, became the main forums for the blossoming of the vedettes. Special mention should be made of the ''Exoticas'', a group of vedettes that caused fury in Mexico's nightlife in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These "Exoticas" were characterized by using extravagant names, and their shows included African, Tahitian or Oriental dances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.revistas.inah.gob.mx/index.php/diariodecampo/article/view/859|title=Tongolele y las "exóticas" en Magazine de Policía y VEA|first=Gabriela Pulido|last=Llano|date=1 October 2013|journal=Diario de Campo|issue=13|pages=32–36|accessdate=2 July 2018|via=www.revistas.inah.gob.mx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180702093257/https://www.revistas.inah.gob.mx/index.php/diariodecampo/article/view/859#|archive-date=2018-07-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of the "Exoticas" was [[Tongolele|Yolanda Montes "Tongolele"]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vivelohoy.com/entretenimiento/8041423/perfume-de-gardenia-arranca-gira-en-la|title=Perfume de Gardenia arranca gira en LA|first=Tommy|last=Calle|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most important dancers of Latin America, and has been in force for more than sixty years. Together with ''Tongolele'', the most famous were [[Su Muy Key]] ''The Chinese Doll'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miguelangelmoralex-bitacora.blogspot.com/2010/05/su-muy-key.html|title=Bitácora: SU-MUY-KEY|first=Miguel Angel|last=Morales|date=1 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Ellen Bromfield|Kalantan]]. Another famous "Exóticas" were Trudi Bora, Turanda, Joyce Cameron, Tanabonga, Tundra, Gemma, Eda Lorna, Kurumba, Bongala, Tula Montenegro, Brenda Conde, Josefina del Mar and Naná.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poresto.net/ver_nota.php?zona=yucatan&amp;idSeccion=33&amp;idTitulo=94881|title=''Por esto Yucatán: The Amazing World of the Exoticas''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Parallel to the success of the Exoticas, they appear in Mexico the famous "Rumberas", dancers of Afro-American rhythms. The Rumberas managed to create their own cinematographic genre: The [[Rumberas film]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/rumbarr.html|title=1946-1950: Rumberas y Arrabal|website=cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222034740/http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/rumbarr.html#|archive-date=2012-02-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the called [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema]]. The Rumberas films reflected in many of its arguments the life of the women in the night centers and cabarets. The main exponents of the genre were the Cubans [[María Antonieta Pons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0690512/bio|title=María Antonieta Pons|website=IMDb|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amalia Aguilar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amaliaaguilar.com/history_1.html|title=Amalia Aguilar - Beginnings|website=www.amaliaaguilar.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ninón Sevilla]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.esmas.com/entretenimiento/biografias/022450/ninon-sevilla|title=Ninón Sevilla|last=Espectáculos|date=2 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Rosa Carmina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rincondelaanoranza.blogspot.com/search?q=rosa+carmina|title=El Rincón de la Añoranza|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well the Mexican [[Meche Barba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rincondelaanoranza.blogspot.com/2008/09/las-rumberas-parte-4-la-rumbera.html|title=El Rincón de la Añoranza: LAS RUMBERAS parte 4: LA RUMBERA MEXICANA... MECHE BARBA|first=René Muñoz|last=López|date=1 September 2008|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
These women were complete vedettes who never needed to explicitly teach their bodies, captivating audiences only with their dances and other stage talents. The Rumberas also performed shows and live performances in important venues. With the decline of the Rumberas film in the mid-fifties, some rumberas broadened their horizons and ventured into vedette shows. Particularly remembered are the live shows of Amalia Aguilar and Rosa Carmina, who even filled stadiums in various countries in Central and South America.
The Cuban [[Rosita Fornés]] deserves special mention. She reaches the final consecration in Mexico before conquering the rest of the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/estrellas/rosita_fornes.html|title=Rosita Fornés|website=cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704020007/http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/estrellas/rosita_fornes.html#|archive-date=2013-07-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s the splendor of the vedettes in Mexico lost force. Even so, worthy of mention are the shows offered in venues such as the Blanquita Theater or "El Patio" by the stars such as [[Sonia Furió]], [[Ana Luisa Peluffo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poresto.net/ver_nota.php?zona=yucatan&amp;idSeccion=33&amp;idTitulo=97347|title=''Por esto Yucatán: Ana Luisa Peluffo|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ana Bertha Lepe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elanecdotario.com/2006/ago06/7/ago7a.htm|title=''Article about Ana Bertha Lepe''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the midst of the fury of the [[Rock and Roll]] era, were famous figures like Malú Reyes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estroncio90.typepad.com/blog/2011/12/malu-reyes.html|title=Malu Reyes - Vuelve Primavera: El rock de los 60 en México|website=estroncio90.typepad.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Emily Cranz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.venamimundo.com/Videos/EmilyCranz.html|title=Emily Cranz|website=www.venamimundo.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actresses such as [[Jacqueline Voltaire]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.articulosiete.com/content/qu%C3%A9-se-fi%C3%A7ieron-las-chicas-go-go|title=''ArtículoSiete.com: The A Go go Girls''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305041541/http://www.articulosiete.com//content/qu%C3%A9-se-fi%C3%A7ieron-las-chicas-go-go|archive-date=5 March 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irán Eory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://diariojudio.com/comunidad-judia-mexico/iran-eory-zl-leyenda-del-cine-y-la-television-mexicana/7463/#|title=Iran Eory Z'L, Leyenda del Cine y la Televisión Mexicana - Diario Judío: Diario de la Vida Judía en México y el Mundo|website=diariojudio.com|accessdate=2 July 2018|date=2015-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; also performed shows as vedettes.


The 1970s and 1980s are considered the golden era of the vedettes in Mexico, thanks to a massive revival of nightlife in the country's capital. Mexico City was flooded with nightclubs, cabarets of all levels and burlesque theaters where the vedettes began to bloom. Among the most important nightclubs that illuminated the capital of the country are the Terazza Casino, the Capri (from the Hotel Regis), the Imperial, the Minuet, the Rio Rosa, La Fuente, El Conjunto Marrakech, La Copa de Champagne, El Cordiale, El Rondinella, El Clóset, El Quid, El 77, the Impala Bar and the Belvedere of the Hilton Continental Hotel. Some cabarets such as La Burbuja, Montparnasse, Las Fabulosas, El Can-Can, Los Globos, King Kong and Savoy also reached a great boom, while theaters like El Iris, El Blanquita and the [[Teatro Fru Fru]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revistacinefagia.com/2004/07/tivoli/|title=Tívoli - revistacinefagia.com|first=Revista|last=Cinefagia|website=www.revistacinefagia.com|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented burlesque shows, where the shows were more audacious and explicit. In addition, thanks to television, movies and magazines, the vedettes in Mexico reached their highest point of popularity. Many of them also ventured into the cinema, within the so-called [[Mexican sex comedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/ficheras.html|title=1976-1982: Los años de las "Ficheras"|website=cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801011320/http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/ficheras.html#|archive-date=2013-08-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the other hand, the popular television program ''Variedades de medianoche (Varieties of the Midnight)'' contributed to the boom of these women and launched to the fame to dozens of them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinematerapia.blogspot.mx/2011/12/variedades-de-medianoche-1977.html|title=''Cinematerapia: Variedades de Medianoche''|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106190012/http://cinematerapia.blogspot.mx/2011/12/variedades-de-medianoche-1977.html#|archive-date=2017-11-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First publication of stories===
Details of the first UK publication of the stories published in ''While the Light Lasts'' are as follows:

* ''The House of Dreams'': First published in issue 74 of the ''Sovereign'' Magazine in January 1926, illustrated by Stanley Lloyd.
* ''The Actress'': First published in issue 218 of ''The Novel Magazine'' in May 1923 under the title of ''A Trap for the Unwary'', with an illustration by Emile Verpilleux. Prior to the publication of this volume, the story (with its 1923 illustration) was reprinted in the 1990 paperback ''Agatha Christie – Official Centenary Celebration'' by Belgrave Publishing ({{ISBN|0-00-637675-4}}). ''The Actress'' is Christie's original title for this story.
* ''The Edge'': First published, unillustrated, in issue 374 of ''Pearson's'' Magazine in February 1927.
* ''Christmas Adventure'': First published, unillustrated, in issue 1611 of ''[[The Sketch]]'' Magazine on 11 December 1923. The story was later expanded into novella form and was printed as the [[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding|title story]] in the 1960 UK collection ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding]]''.
* ''The Lonely God'': First published in issue 333 of the ''[[Royal Magazine]]'' in July 1926, with illustrations by H. Coller.  Christie's original title for this story was ''The Little Lonely God''.
* ''Manx Gold'' was one of the most unusual commissions undertaken by Christie in her career. As described in detail in an editorial note, the idea of a [[treasure hunting]] story was prompted by a wish on the part of Manx politicians to promote tourism to the [[Isle of Man]].  Christie wrote a short story which was serialised in the ''[[Daily Dispatch]]'' in five instalments on 23, 24, 26, 27 and 28 May 1930. The story gave the clues to the location of four [[snuffbox]]es hidden on the island, each of which contained a voucher for £100 – a considerable sum in 1930. Island residents were barred from taking part. To further promote the hunt, the story was then published in a promotional booklet entitled ''June in Douglas'' which was distributed at guesthouses and other tourist spots. Although a quarter of a million copies of this booklet were printed, only one is known to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.twbooks.co.uk/crimescene/christienews.html Announcement of publication of "Manx Gold"], twbooks.co.uk; accessed 6 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Within a Wall'': First published in issue 324 of the ''[[Royal Magazine]]'' in October 1925.
* ''The Mystery of the Baghdad Chest'': First published in issue 493 of the ''[[Strand Magazine]]'' in January 1932. The story was later expanded into novella form and was printed as ''[[The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding#The Mystery of the Spanish Chest|The Mystery of the Spanish Chest]]'' in the 1960 UK collection ''The Adventure of the Christmas Pudding''.
* ''"While the Light Lasts"'': First published in issue 229 of ''The Novel Magazine'' in April 1924, with two illustrations by Howard K. Elcock. The plot of this short story is similar to that of her novel ''[[Giant's Bread]]''.
