      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4653">'''Andreas Gotzmann''' (born 1960 in [[Karlsruhe]]) is a [[Germany|German]] historian of Judaism and scholar of religion. He holds the Chair for Jewish Studies and Religious Studies at the [[University of Erfurt]] (Germany).

== Education ==
Andreas Gotzmann graduated from the Hochschule für Jüdische Studien in Heidelberg and the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg in 1988 with an M.A. in Jewish History, Rabbinics &amp; Codices, and Jewish Art History. He received his Ph.D. in Jewish Studies at the Freie Universität Berlin in 1995. Between 1990-1995 he was a research fellow in New York and Jerusalem; from 1994-1997 he was first a research assistant, then assistant professor for Jewish History and Culture at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main; since 1999 full professor for Jewish Studies at the newly founded Erfurt University.

Amongst other memberships and positions, he was member of the executive board of the ‚Association for Jewish Studies in Germany‘ (Verband der Judaisten in Deutschland) from 2002–2006; between 2003-2007 director of the Religious Studies Seminar at Erfurt University; still long-time member of the executive board of the ‚German Board for Scientific Research‘ (Wissenschaftliche Arbeitsgemeinschaft) of the International Leo Baeck Institute etc. Amongst other invitations: Very Distinguished Harris Visiting Professor for Jewish History at Dartmouth College, Hanover NH in 2002.

== Research ==
Andreas Gotzmann authors numerous scholarly publications, mainly about German-Jewish history. His expertise covers the early modern and the modern period. Special fields of interest are research on cultural change and processes of social consolidation of cultural models and identities, legal and social history, as well as history of mentalities and ideas. Beyond that, he works on the theory and method of cultural history and is one of the leading scholars to introduce approaches and methods of cultural studies to Jewish studies. 
Next to his research in modern Jewish history, Gotzmann heads the international research cluster entitled ‚Jewish Holy Roman Empire‘ which draws together scholars and institutions from a multitude of countries since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;„[https://archive.is/20130212074650/http://www2.uni-erfurt.de/judaistik/project_cluster/juedisches_heiliges.shtml]“.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recent awards ==
For his book, ''Jewish Autonomy in Early Modern Time. Ideas of Law and Community in German Jewish Culture'' published in 2008 Gotzmann received the  '[[Arnsberg Award]]' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;„[http://www.sptg.de/1pm-2010-08-18-verleihung-arnsbergpreis.aspx]“.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brain Gym International''' is the [[trade name]] of the Educational Kinesiology Foundation, a California nonprofit organization that promotes a series of exercises called "Brain Gym" that the company claims improve academic performance. The underlying ideas are [[pseudoscience]], and as of 2014 there was no good evidence that the exercises are effective in improving learning.

==Business==
In the 1970s, Paul and Gail Dennison developed a set of physical exercises that they say improve children's ability to learn and that they say are based in neuroscience; they called their approach "educational kinesthesiology".&lt;ref name name=DCSF2009&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Commons Science and Technology Select Committee Evidence Check|url=https://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/091125-evidence-check-government-responses-to-questions-from-the-iuss-committee.pdf|publisher=House of Commons|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Spaulding&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spaulding|first1=Lucinda S.|last2=Mostert|first2=Mark P.|last3=Beam|first3=Andrea P.|title=Is Brain Gym® an Effective Educational Intervention?|journal=Exceptionality|date=19 January 2010|volume=18|issue=1|pages=18–30|doi=10.1080/09362830903462508}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The company makes money training people in the methods, and licenses the right to use the "Brain Gym" trademark to people whom it trains; the trained people use branded books and other materials they buy from the company.&lt;ref name=Spaulding/&gt;&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;  Schools pay the trained people to work in schools, training teachers and working with students.&lt;ref name name=DCSF2009/&gt;

In 2005 the company claimed to be selling its programs in 80 countries and by 2007 it had been widely covered in the press.&lt;ref name=wishful2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hyatt|first1=K.

== Methods ==
The Brain Gym program calls for children to repeat certain simple movements such as crawling, yawning, making symbols in the air, and drinking water which are claimed to increase blood flow to the brain, "integrate" the brain, and "repattern" the brain.&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldacre2010/&gt;

The claims of the organization for the effectiveness of its methods in improving educational outcomes were not supported by evidence as of 2014, and although the organization says the methods are grounded in good neuroscience, the underlying ideas are [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldacre2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldacre|first1=Ben|title=Bad science : quacks, hacks, and big pharma flacks|date=2010|publisher=Faber and Faber|isbn=9781429967099|edition=First American|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=znCisNI4c8MC&amp;pg=PA15|chapter=2: Brain Gym}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-NN2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Howard-Jones|first1=Paul A.|title=Neuroscience and education: myths and messages|journal=Nature Reviews Neuroscience|date=15 October 2014|volume=15|issue=12|pages=817–824|doi=10.1038/nrn3817|pmid=25315391}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TES2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=Hilary|last2=Rose|first2=Steven|title=The false promise of neuroeducation|journal=Times Educational Supplement|date=23 June 2016|url=https://www.tes.com/news/tes-magazine/tes-magazine/false-promise-neuroeducation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Howard-Jones|first1=Paul|title=Neuroscience and Education: A Review of Educational Interventions and Approaches Informed by Neuroscience |url=https://v1.educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/uploads/pdf/NSED_LitReview_Final.pdf|publisher=The Education Endowment Foundation|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denton|first1=Carolyn A.|title=Physical Exercise and Movement-Based Interventions for Dyslexia|journal=Perspectives on Language and Literacy|date=Winter 2011|volume=37|issue=1|pages=27–31|url=http://www.onlinedigeditions.com/article/Physical_Exercise_and_Movement-Based_Interventions_for_Dyslexia/625341/59673/article.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TLRP&gt;{{cite web|title=Neuroscience and Education: Issues and Opportunities|publisher=[[Economic and Social Research Council]] Teaching and Learning Research Programme|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015443/http://www.tlrp.org/pub/documents/Neuroscience%20Commentary%20FINAL.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2009|url=http://www.tlrp.org/pub/documents/Neuroscience%20Commentary%20FINAL.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCall|first1=Linda Ann H.|title=Brain-based Pedagogy in Today’s Diverse Classrooms: A Perfect Fit—But Be Careful!|journal=The Delta Kappa Gamma Bulletin|date=Spring 2012|volume=78|issue=3|pages=42–47|url=http://www.deltakappagamma.org/NH/Spring%202012_Professional%20Development_2-27-12.pdf#page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://theconversation.com/how-neuroscience-is-being-used-to-spread-quackery-in-business-and-education-30342|title=How neuroscience is being used to spread quackery in business and education|work=Matt Wall|publisher=The Conversation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the underlying ideas is that the exercises are meant to ‘balance’ the [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]] so the two "sides" work together better; there is also a notion of integrating the "top" parts of the brain with the "lower" parts of the brain to integrate thought and emotion, as well as integrating visual, auditory, and motor skills; these are all fairly common "neuromyths" based on work published by [[Samuel Orton]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-NN2014"/&gt;

Another idea is that of "brain buttons" - spots on the neck that if touched in certain ways, can stimulate the flow of blood to the brain.&lt;ref name=TLRP/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sense2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/index.php/site/project/233/ |title=Sense About Science – Brain Gym |publisher=[[Sense About Science]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122215146/http://www.senseaboutscience.org.uk/pdf/braingym.pdf|archivedate=November 22, 2009 |quote=These exercises are being taught with pseudoscientific explanations that undermine science teaching and mislead children about how their bodies work. ... There have been a few peer reviewed scientific studies into the methods of Brain Gym, but none of them found a significant improvement in general academic skills.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another set of underlying ideas is [[psychomotor patterning]], also known as the Doman-Delacato theory of development, which claims that if motor skills are not acquired in the correct order, the result will be a lifelong deficit in learning ability, and also claims that these deficits can be overcome by going back and learning the skipped skills; this theory and claims to improve learning based on it were discredited in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=wishful2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"/&gt; An example of this in the Brain Gym method, is to have children practice crawling.&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"/&gt;

In 2009, after inquiries from the House of Commons, the UK [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] said that it had no policy on Brain Gym, and said that it was aware of substantial criticism, and was not aware of substantial research supporting Brain Gym's effectiveness.&lt;ref name name=DCSF2009/&gt;

As of 2014, publications presenting research finding that the methods are effective in improving learning had not appeared in high quality journals, and the papers that had been published were widely condemned for methodological flaws and small sample sizes that made generalization not possible.&lt;ref name="HJ-EEF2014"/&gt;

(Chantal Mouffe) data sheet (b. 17 June 1943) }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Belgian [[political theorist]], currently teaching at [[University of Westminster]].&lt;ref name="Westminster"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.westminster.ac.uk/about-us/our-people/directory/mouffe-chantal |title=Chantal Mouffe |publisher=westminster.ac.uk |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is best known for her contribution to the development—jointly with [[Ernesto Laclau]], with whom she co-authored ''[[Hegemony and Socialist Strategy]]''—of the so-called [[Essex School of discourse analysis]],&lt;ref&gt;See Jules Townshend, 'Discourse theory and political analysis: a new paradigm from the Essex School?’, ''British Journal of Politics and International Relations'', Vol. 5, No. 1, February 2003, pp. 129–142, and ‘Laclau and Mouffe’s Hegemonic Project: The Story So Far’, ''Political Studies'', 52, 2004, pp. 269-288.&lt;/ref&gt; a type of [[post-Marxist]] political inquiry drawing on [[Gramsci]], post-structuralism and theories of identity, and redefining Leftist politics in terms of radical democracy and [[context free grammar]]s of power relations. Her highest cited publication is ''Hegemony and socialist strategy: Towards a radical democratic politics'' at 15309 times, according to Google Scholar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C44&amp;q=Chantal+Mouffe&amp;btnG= |title=Chantal Mouffe |publisher=scholar.google.com |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Chantal Mouffe studied at the Universities of [[Université catholique de Louvain|Louvain]], [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Essex|Essex]] and has worked in many universities throughout the world (in Europe, North America and Latin America). She has also held visiting positions at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Cornell University|Cornell]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]] (Paris). During the 1989–1995 period she served as Programme Director at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] in Paris. She currently holds a professorship at the Department of Politics and International Relations, [[University of Westminster]] in the United Kingdom, where she directs the Centre for the Study of Democracy.&lt;ref name="Westminster"/&gt;

==Work==
A prominent critic of [[deliberative democracy]] (especially in its [[John Rawls|Rawlsian]] and [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] versions), she is also known for her critical use of the work of [[Carl Schmitt]], mainly the concept of "the political", in proposing a radicalization of modern democracy—what she calls "agonistic pluralism". She has developed an interest in highlighting the radical potential of artistic practices. Mouffe's ''Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically'' (2013) has been criticised by Timothy Laurie for its strong focus on State institutions, noting that Mouffe's "professed enthusiasm for (some) non-Western Islamist movements is solely conditional upon their assumption of State instruments".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Review: 'Agonistics: Thinking the World Politically' | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= Melbourne Journal of Politics | year= 2013 | url= https://www.academia.edu/5433656}} vol. 36, pp. 76-78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Children's Environmental Exposure Research Study''' (or '''CHEERS''') was a study conducted by the United States [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] designed to examine how children may be exposed to [[pesticide]]s and other chemicals used in U.S. households, such as [[phthalate]]s, [[brominated flame retardant]]s, and [[Fluorocarbon|perfluorinated compound]]s ([[PFOS]], [[PFOA]], [[PFNA]], and others).&lt;ref&gt;Tulve, N. S. AND R. C. Fortmann. LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF YOUNG CHILDREN'S EXPOSURES IN THEIR HOMES TO SELECTED PESTICIDES, PHTHALATES, BROMINATED FLAME RETARDANTS, AND PERFLUORINATED CHEMICALS (A CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE RESEARCH STUDY - CHEERS). Presented at American Chemistry Council Peer Advisory Committee Meeting, Arlington, VA, October 6, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-year study began in the summer of 2004 and was conducted in [[Duval County, Florida]], a region with high concentration of pesticides.

On April 8, 2005, [[Stephen L. Johnson]] cancelled the study after the program was criticized. Johnson himself was heavily criticized for his support in the use of human test subjects during his tenure as EPA's Assistant Administrator for Toxic Substances.

== Mechanics of the study ==
The study was due to be completed in two years, researchers would follow the progress of 60 young children whose parents sprayed pesticides frequently.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethical Issues in Clinical Research: A Practical Guide|last=Lo|first=Bernard|publisher=Wolter Kluwer|year=2010|isbn=9780781788175|location=Philadelphia, PA|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would collect data every six months taken from biological samples such as blood and urine. Parents were also required to document specific information such as food and liquid intake. They must also record their children's activities on video. To qualify, a family has to have a confirmed history of residential pesticide use, a child under the age of 13 months and must agree to continue using pesticides inside the residential abode.

Participating families were promised monetary compensation of up to $970, study T-shirt, framed Certificate of Appreciation, study bib for the baby, calendar, study newsletter, and a [[camcorder]].

==Controversies==
EPA recruiting information for CHEERS claimed that participation in the study presented "no risk" to the subjects or their families. Critics, however, contended that the state of knowledge about pesticide exposure risks to infants and children while imprecise, suggests that residential pesticide exposure poses developmental risks to infants and children. This meant that CHEERS would have paid families to expose their children to pesticides for two years. EPA denied this, stressing that because CHEERS would have only examined families who used pesticides prior to the study, CHEERS would not have increased the subject families' exposure to pesticides. The argument is based on the fact that the study had an observational, rather than experimental design.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ethics of Research with Human Subjects: Protecting People, Advancing Science, Promoting Trust|last=Resnik|first=David|publisher=Springer|year=2018|isbn=9783319687551|location=Berlin|pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was fear, however, that the study could induce parents to intentionally expose their children to pesticides to be able to qualify in the high-use group of the study.

The study was also criticized for using disproportionately black, lower-income families as subjects. EPA's claim was that Duval County was chosen because they knew that many families in the area were using large amounts of pesticides to control roaches and pests.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The EPA also received $2 million of the proposed 9 million budget for the CHEERS study from the [[American Chemistry Council]], a [[lobbying]] group representing 135 chemical companies&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Wrong Complexion for Protection: How the Government Response to Disaster Endangers African American Communities|last=Bullard|first=Robert|last2=Wright|first2=Beverly|publisher=New York University Press|year=2012|isbn=9780814799932|location=New York|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; in exchange for measuring levels of common household chemicals such as flame, retardants, and ingredients in plastic products along with pesticides.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since the results could directly affect rules for chemical manufacturers, this was interpreted by organizations like the [[Environmental Working Group]] as a [[conflict of interest]]. There are also those who criticized the need to accept money from donors when the agency's budget for research was $572 million.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The CHEERS project was terminated in 2005 after it became a political matter. Thereafter, the U.S. Congress also passed a law that bans EPA from funding intentional exposure research that involves children and pregnant or nursing women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Health Ethics|last=Resnik|first=David|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=9781107023956|location=Cambridge|pages=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frets, guitar neck, C-major chord.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A [[guitar player]] performing a C chord with G bass.]]

A '''chord''', in [[music]], is any [[harmony|harmonic]] set of pitches consisting of two or more (usually three or more) [[Musical note|notes]] (also called "pitches") that are heard as if sounding [[Simultaneity (music)|simultaneously]].&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice, Vol. I'', pp.&amp;nbsp;67, 359. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}."A ''chord'' is a harmonic unit with at least three different tones sounding simultaneously." "A combination of three or more pitches sounding at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Introducing Music |last=Károlyi |first=Otto |year=1965 |publisher=Penguin Books |page=63 |quote=Two or more notes sounding simultaneously are known as a ''chord''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (For many practical and theoretical purposes, [[arpeggio]]s and broken chords, or sequences of [[Factor (chord)|chord tones]], may also be considered as chords.)

Chords and [[Chord progression|sequences of chords]] are frequently used in modern West African&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Barry (January 16, 2008). "[http://theoryofmusic.wordpress.com/2008/01/16/an-explanation-for-the-emergence-of-jazz-1956/ An explanation for the emergence of Jazz (1956)]", ''Theory of Music''.&lt;/ref&gt; and Oceanic music,&lt;ref&gt;Linkels, Ad, ''The Real Music of Paradise"'', In Broughton, Simon and Ellingham, Mark with McConnachie, James and Duane, Orla (Ed.), ''World Music, Vol. 2: Latin &amp; North America, Caribbean, India, Asia and Pacific'', pp. 218–29. Rough Guides Ltd, Penguin Books. {{ISBN|1-85828-636-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western classical music, and Western [[popular music]]; yet, they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.&lt;ref name="Malm"&gt;Malm, William P. (1996). ''Music Cultures of the Pacific, the Near East, and Asia''. p.15. {{ISBN|0-13-182387-6}}. Third edition: "Indeed, this harmonic orientation is one of the major differences between Western and much non-Western music."&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[tonality|tonal]] Western classical music (music with a [[tonic key]] or "home key"), the most frequently encountered chords are [[Triad (music)|triad]]s, so called because they consist of three distinct notes: the root note, and [[Interval (music)|Intervals]] of a [[Third (chord)|third]] and a [[Fifth (chord)|fifth]] above the root note. Other chords with more than three notes include [[added tone chord]]s, [[extended chord]]s and [[tone cluster]]s, which are used in [[contemporary classical music]], [[jazz]] and other genres.

An ordered series of chords is called a [[chord progression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=96DcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=chord+progression+is+ordered+series+of+chords&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3nO--jp7VAhVIr1QKHfHKAhIQ6AEISDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=chord%20progression%20is%20ordered%20series%20of%20chords&amp;f=false|title=Understanding and Crafting the Mix: The Art of Recording|last=Moylan|first=William|date=2014-06-20|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781136117589|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a widely used chord progression in Western [[traditional music]] and [[blues]] is the [[12-bar blues|12 bar blues progression]]. Although any chord may in principle be followed by any other chord, certain patterns of chords are more common in Western music, and some patterns have been accepted as establishing the [[Key (music)|key]] ([[tonic note]]) in [[Common practice harmony|common-practice harmony]]–notably the movement between [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] and [[Dominant (music)|dominant]] chords.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To describe this, Western [[music theory]] has developed the practice of numbering chords using [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]]&lt;ref name="Schoenberg"&gt;Arnold Schoenberg, ''Structural Functions of Harmony'', Faber and Faber, 1983, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; which represent the number of [[diatonic]] steps up from the tonic note of the [[Scale (music)|scale]].

Common ways of notating or representing chords&lt;ref name="B&amp;S 1"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; in Western music (other than conventional [[staff notation]]) include [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]], the [[Nashville number system]], [[figured bass]], [[Macro analysis|macro symbols]] (sometimes used in modern [[musicology]]), and [[chord chart]]s.

The English word ''chord'' derives from Middle English ''cord'', a shortening of ''accord''&lt;ref&gt;Merriam-Webster, Inc. (1995). "Chord", ''[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chord Merriam-Webster's dictionary of English usage]'', p.243. {{ISBN|978-0-87779-132-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in the original sense of ''agreement'' and later, ''harmonious sound''.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chord?rskey=UjcqH7&amp;result=1#m_en_gb0146870 Chord]", ''Oxford Dictionaries''.&lt;/ref&gt; A sequence of chords is known as a chord progression or harmonic progression. These are frequently used in Western music.&lt;ref name="Malm" /&gt; A chord progression  "aims for a definite goal" of establishing (or contradicting) a tonality founded on a key, root or [[Tonic (music)|tonic]] chord.&lt;ref name="Schoenberg" /&gt; The study of harmony involves chords and chord progressions, and the principles of connection that govern them.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Harmony|author=Dahlhaus, Car|access-date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ottó Károlyi]]&lt;ref&gt;Károlyi, Ottó, ''Introducing Music'', p.&amp;nbsp;63. England: Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; writes that, "Two or more notes sounded simultaneously are known as a chord," though, since instances of any given note in different octaves may be taken as the same note, it is more precise for the purposes of analysis to speak of distinct ''pitch classes''. Furthermore, as three notes are needed to define any [[Common chord (music)|common chord]], three is often taken as the minimum number of notes that form a definite chord.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold Schoenberg, ''Theory of Harmony'', p.26: "It is required of a chord that it consist of three different tones."&lt;/ref&gt; Hence [[Andrew Surmani]], for example, (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;72) states, "When three or more notes are sounded together, the combination is called a chord." George T. Jones (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;43) agrees: "Two tones sounding together are usually termed an ''interval'', while three or more tones are called a ''chord''." According to Monath (1984, p.&amp;nbsp;37); "A chord is a combination of three or more tones sounded simultaneously," and the distances between the tones are called intervals. However sonorities of two pitches, or even single-note melodies, are commonly heard as ''implying'' chords.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Schellenberg

In the key of C major, if the music comes to rest on the two notes G and B, most listeners will hear this as a G major chord.

Since a chord may be understood as such even when all its notes are not simultaneously audible, there has been some academic discussion regarding the point at which a group of notes may be called a ''chord''. [[Jean-Jacques Nattiez]] (1990, p.&amp;nbsp;218) explains that, "We can encounter 'pure chords' in a musical work," such as in the ''Promenade'' of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' but, "Often, we must go from a textual given to a more ''abstract'' representation of the chords being used," as in Claude Debussy's ''[[Arabesques (Debussy)|Première Arabesque]]''.

[[File:Debussy Premiere Arabesque melody and chords.png|300px|left|thumb|Upper stave: [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Arabesques (Debussy)|Première Arabesque.]]'' The chords on the lower stave are constructed from the notes in the actual piece, shown on the upper stave. {{audio|Debussy Premiere Arabesque melody and chords.mid|Play}}]]

In the [[medieval music|medieval]] era, early Christian [[hymn]]s featured [[organum]] (which used the simultaneous perfect intervals of a fourth, a fifth, and an octave&lt;ref&gt;Duarter, John (2008). ''Melody &amp; Harmony for Guitarists'', p.49. {{ISBN|978-0-7866-7688-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;), with chord progressions and harmony an incidental result of the emphasis on melodic lines during the medieval and then [[Renaissance]] (15th to 17th centuries).&lt;ref name="B&amp;S 2"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;S70"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.70.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Baroque]] period, the 17th and 18th centuries, began to feature the major and minor scale based tonal system and harmony, including chord progressions and [[circle progression]]s.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.&amp;nbsp;77.&lt;/ref&gt; It was in the Baroque period that the accompaniment of melodies with chords was developed, as in figured bass,&lt;ref name="B&amp;S70"/&gt; and the familiar cadences (perfect authentic, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.100.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Renaissance, certain dissonant sonorities that suggest the dominant seventh occurred with frequency.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S201"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.201.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Baroque period the dominant seventh proper was introduced, and was in constant use in the Classical and Romantic periods.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S201"/&gt; The [[leading-tone seventh chord|leading-tone seventh]] appeared in the Baroque period and remains in use.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.220.&lt;/ref&gt; Composers began to use [[nondominant seventh chord]]s in the Baroque period. They became frequent in the Classical period, gave way to [[Altered chord|altered dominants]] in the Romantic period, and underwent a resurgence in the Post-Romantic and [[Impressionist music|Impressionistic]] period.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.231.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romantic period]], the 19th century, featured increased [[chromaticism]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt; Composers began to use secondary dominants in the Baroque, and they became common in the Romantic period.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p.274.&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary popular Western genres continue to rely on simple diatonic harmony, though far from universally:&lt;ref&gt;Winston Harrison, ''The Rockmaster System: Relating Ongoing Chords to the Keyboard – Rock, Book 1'', Dellwin Publishing Co. 2005, p. 33 [https://books.google.com/books?id=l0Vx5VB96FQC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=diatonic+chords+popular+music&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gDuoTYm6DMzQ4waPkuWzCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; notable exceptions include the music of film scores, which often use chromatic, atonal or post-tonal harmony, and modern jazz (especially circa 1960), in which chords may include up to seven notes (and occasionally more).&lt;ref&gt;Pachet, François, ''Surprising Harmonies'', International Journal on ComputingAnticipatory Systems, 1999. [https://scholar.google.com/] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330131204/https://scholar.google.com/ |date=March 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to chords that do not function as harmony, such as in atonal music, the term "sonority" is often used specifically to avoid any tonal implications of the word "chord"{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}.

Triads consist of three notes; the ''root'' or ''first'' note, the ''third'', and the ''fifth''.&lt;ref&gt;Pen, Ronald (1992). ''Introduction to Music'', p.81. McGraw-Hill, {{ISBN|0-07-038068-6}}. "In each case the note that forms the foundation pitch is called the ''root'', the middle tone of the chord is designated the ''third'' (because it is separated by the interval of a third from the root), and the top tone is referred to as the ''fifth'' (because it is a fifth away from the root)."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the '''C''' [[major scale]] consists of the notes '''C D E F G A B''': a triad can be constructed on any note of such a major scale, and all are minor or major except the triad on the seventh or [[leading-tone]], which is a diminished chord. A triad formed using the note '''C''' itself consists of '''C''' (the root note), '''E''' (the third note of the scale) and '''G''' (the fifth note of the scale). The interval from '''C''' to '''E''' is of four semitones, a [[major third]], and so this triad is called '''C''' Major. A triad formed upon the same scale but with '''D''' as the root note, '''D''' (root),''' F''' (third), '''A''' (fifth), on the other hand, has only three semitones between the root and third and is called '''D''' minor, a minor triad.

==Notation==
{{Redirects|Chord symbol||Chord names and symbols (popular music)}}
[[Image:C triad.svg|thumb|right|200px|C Major triad represented in staff notation]]

Chords can be represented in various ways. The most common notation systems are:&lt;ref name="B&amp;S" /&gt;
# Plain staff notation, used in classical music
# [[Roman numeral analysis|Roman numerals]], commonly used in [[harmonic analysis (music)|harmonic analysis]] to denote the [[Scale (music)|scale step]] on which the chord is built.&lt;ref name="Schoenberg" /&gt;
# [[Figured bass]], much used in the Baroque era, uses numbers added to a bass line written on [[staff (music)]], to enable keyboard players to [[Improvised music|improvise]] chords with the right hand while playing the bass with their left.
# [[Macro analysis|Macro symbols]], sometimes used in modern musicology, to denote chord root and quality.
# Various [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)|chord names and symbols]] used in popular music lead sheets, [[fake book]]s, and chord charts, to quickly lay out the harmonic groundplan of a piece so that the musician may [[musical improvisation|improvise]], [[Jam (music)|jam]], or [[Vamp (music)|vamp]] on it.

===Roman numerals===
{{Main|Roman numeral analysis}}
[[Image:Vi-ii-V-I in C.png|thumb|right|The chord progression vi–ii–V–I in the key of C major. Using lead sheet chord names, these chords could be referred to as A minor, D minor, G major and C major.&lt;ref&gt;William G Andrews and Molly Sclater (2000). ''Materials of Western Music Part 1'', p. 227. {{ISBN|1-55122-034-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{audio|Vi-ii-V-I in C.mid|Play}}.]]

While [[scale degree]]s are typically represented in musical analysis or musicology articles with [[Arabic numeral]]s (e.g., 1, 2, 3..., sometimes with a [[circumflex]] above the numeral: {{music|scale|1}}, {{music|scale|2}}, {{music|scale|3}}...), the triads (three-note chords) that have these degrees as their roots are often identified by Roman numerals (e.g., I, IV, V, which in the key of C major would be the triads C major, F major, G major). In some conventions (as in this and related articles) upper-case [[Roman numeral]]s indicate major triads (e.g., I, IV, V) while lower-case Roman numerals indicate minor triads (e.g., I for a major chord and i for a minor chord, or using the major key, ii, iii and vi representing typical diatonic minor triads): other writers, (e.g. [[Schoenberg]]) use upper case Roman numerals for both major and minor triads. Some writers use upper-case Roman numerals to indicate the chord is diatonic in the major scale, and lower-case Roman numerals to indicate that the chord is diatonic in the minor scale. Diminished triads may be represented by lower-case Roman numerals with a [[degree symbol]] (e.g., vii{{music|dim}}&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; indicates a diminished seventh chord built on the seventh scale degree; in the key of C major, this chord would be b diminished seventh, which consists of the notes B, D, F and G{{music|#}}).

Roman numerals can also be used in stringed instrument notation to indicate the [[Violin#Positions|position]] or string to play. In some string music, the string on which it is suggested that the performer play the note is indicated with a Roman numeral (e.g., on a four-string [[string orchestra|orchestral string]] instrument (violin, viola, cello or double bass), I indicates the highest-pitched, thinnest string and IV indicates the lowest-pitched, thickest bass string). In some orchestral parts, chamber music and solo works for string instruments, the composer specifies to the performer which string should be used with the Roman numeral. Alternately, the note name of the string that the composer wishes the performer to use are stated using letters (e.g., "sul G" means "play on the G string").

===Figured bass notation===
{{Main|Figured bass}}
[[Image:C with 64 figured bass.svg|thumb|left|A bass note with figured bass symbols underneath the staff. The figured bass symbols indicate the intervals the chord-playing musician should play above the bass note. The figure in this illustration indicates that the intervals of a sixth above the bass and a fourth above the bass should be played.]]
Figured bass or thoroughbass is a kind of [[musical notation]] used in almost all Baroque music ({{circa}} 1600–1750), though rarely in  music from later than 1750, to indicate harmonies in relation to a conventionally written [[bass line]]. Figured bass is closely associated with chord-playing [[Figured bass#Basso continuo|basso continuo]] [[accompaniment]] instruments, which include [[harpsichord]], [[pipe organ]] and [[lute]]. Added numbers, symbols and [[Accidental (music)|accidentals]] beneath the staff indicate at the intervals to play, the numbers stand for the number of scale steps above the written note to play the figured notes. In the 2010s, some classical musicians who specialize in music from the Baroque era can still perform chords using figured bass notation; in many cases, however, the chord-playing performers read a fully notated accompaniment that has been prepared for the piece by the music publisher. Such a part, with fully written-out chords, is called a "realization" of the figured bass part.

In the illustration the bass note is a '''C''', and the numbers 4 and 6 indicate that notes a fourth and a sixth above, that is '''F''' and '''A''', should be played, giving the [[second inversion]] of the '''F''' major triad. If no numbers are written beneath a bass note, this is assumed to indicate the figure 5,3, which calls for a third and a fifth above the bass note (i.e., a root position triad).

===Macro analysis===
[[Image:Macro analysis chords on C.png|thumb|right|300px|Macro analysis for triads on C.]]
{{Main|Macro analysis}}
Macro analysis is used by [[musicologist]]s, music theorists and advanced university music students to analyze songs and pieces. Macro analysis uses upper-case and lower-case letters to indicate the roots of chords, followed by symbols that specify the chord quality.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S 3"&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003). ''Music: In Theory and Practice'', Vol. I,  pp. 74–75. Seventh Edition. {{ISBN|978-0-07-294262-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basics===
{{Main|Chord names and symbols (popular music)}}
In most [[List of popular music genres|genres]] of popular music, including jazz, [[pop music|pop]], and rock, a chord name and the corresponding symbol are typically composed of one or more parts. In these genres, chord-playing musicians in the [[rhythm section]] (e.g., [[electric guitar]], [[acoustic guitar]], [[piano]], [[Hammond organ]], etc.) typically [[improvisation (music)|improvise]] the specific "[[Voicing (music)|voicing]]" of each chord from a song's chord progression by interpreting the written chord symbols appearing in the lead sheet or [[fake book]]. Normally, these chord symbols include:
* A (big) letter indicating the [[root (chord)|root note]] (e.g.  C).
* A symbol or abbreviation indicating the [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)#Chord quality|chord quality]] (e.g. minor, aug or '''{{music|dim}}''' ). ''(If no chord quality is specified, the chord is assumed to be a Major triad by default)''.
* Number(s) indicating the stacked [[Interval (music)#Number|intervals]] above the root note (e.g. 7 or 13).
* Additional musical symbols or abbreviations for special alterations (e.g. {{music|b}}5, {{music|#}}5 or  add13).
* An added slash "/" and an upper case letter indicates that a bass note other than the root should be played.  (e.g.  C/F indicates that an C Major triad should be played with an added F in the bass).

Chord qualities are related with the [[Interval (music)#Quality|qualities]] of the component intervals that define the chord. The main chord qualities are:
* Major and minor (a chord is "Major" by default and altered with added info:  "C" = C Major,  "Cm" = c minor).
* [[Augmented chord|augmented]], [[diminished triad|diminished]], and [[half-diminished seventh chord|half-diminished]],
* [[dominant chord|dominant seventh]].

===Symbols===
The symbols used for notating chords are:
* '''m''' or '''min''' for minor  ''(the minor quality should always be written in small letters)'',&lt;ref name="correction"&gt;The assumption that a chord can be indicated "the German way"; using only capital or small letters ("C" for Major, or "c" for minor) is a fatal misunderstanding. The German tradition only uses this when describing the tonality of the key (g-minor, or F#-Major). To try to use this for chords is woefully inaccurate and shouldn't be used.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''−''' ''A hyphen/minus symbol is sometimes used for minor, this is common in jazz lead sheets''
* '''M''', '''Ma''', '''Maj''', or no symbol for Major  ''(the Major quality should always be written with (a) Capital letter)'',
* '''{{music|major}}''' ''The symbol '''{{music|major}}''' is also commonly used for Major. (In a jazz context, this typically indicates that the player should use any suitable chord of a major quality, for example a [[major seventh chord|a Major seventh]] chord or a 6/9 chord. In a lot of jazz styles, an unembellished major triad is rarely if ever played, but in a lead sheet the choice of which major quality chord to use is left to the performer)''
* '''+''' or '''aug''' is used for [[Augmented chord|augmented]] ('''A''' or '''a''' is not used),
* '''{{music|dim}}'''  or '''dim''' is used for [[diminished triad|diminished]] ('''d''' is not used),
* '''{{music|halfdim}}''' is used for [[half-diminished seventh chord|half-diminished]] (in some [[fake book]]s, the abbreviation  m&lt;sup&gt;7({{music|b}}5)&lt;/sup&gt;  is used as an equivalent symbol),
* '''2''' Is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g. add2, sus2),
* '''3''' Is the minor or Major quality of the chord and hardly ever gets written as a number,
* '''4''' Is mostly used as an extra note in a chord (e.g. add4, sus4),
* '''5''' Is the (perfect) fifth of the chord and is only written as a number when [[Chord names and symbols (popular music)#Altered fifths|altered]] (e.g. F7&lt;sup&gt;({{music|b}}5)&lt;/sup&gt;). (exception, [[power chord]]s; see below),
* '''6''' is used for a [[sixth chord]]. There are no rules if the 6 '''replaces''' the 5th or not.
* '''7''' is used for a [[dominant seventh chord|dominant 7th chord]]. However, if Maj7, M7 or {{music|major}}7 is indicated, this is a [[major seventh|Major 7th chord]] (e.g. G&lt;sup&gt;M7&lt;/sup&gt; or F&lt;sup&gt;Δ7&lt;/sup&gt;). Very rarely, also '''dom''' is used for dominant 7th,
* '''9''' is used for a [[ninth chord]], which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh as well, if it is a dominant chord,
* '''11''' is used for a [[eleventh chord]], which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh and ninth as well, if it is a dominant chord,
* '''13''' is used for a [[thirteenth chord]] , which in jazz usually includes the dominant seventh, ninth and eleventh as well,
* '''6/9''' indicates a triad with the addition of the sixth and ninth,
* '''sus4''' (or simply '''4''') indicates that the third is omitted and the fourth used instead. Other notes may be added to a sus4 chord, indicated with the word "add" and the scale degree (e.g., A&lt;sup&gt;sus4(add9)&lt;/sup&gt; or A&lt;sup&gt;sus4(add7)&lt;/sup&gt;).
* '''sus2''' (or simply '''2''') indicates that the third is omitted and the second (which may also be called the ninth) is used instead. As with "sus4", a "sus2" chord can have other scale degrees added (e.g., A&lt;sup&gt;sus2(add{{music|b}}7)&lt;/sup&gt; or A&lt;sup&gt;sus2(add4)&lt;/sup&gt;)
* '''({{music|b}}9)''' (parenthesis) is used to indicate explicit chord alterations (e.g., A&lt;sup&gt;7({{music|b}}9)&lt;/sup&gt;). The parenthesis is probably left from older days when jazz musicians weren't used to "altered chords". Albeit important, the parenthesis can be left unplayed (with no "musical harm"),
* '''add''' indicates that an additional interval number should be added to the chord. (e.g. C&lt;sup&gt;7add13&lt;/sup&gt; is a C 7th chord plus an added 13th),
* '''alt''' (or "alt dom") is used in jazz to indicate an [[altered dominant]] seventh chord (e.g. G&lt;sup&gt;7{{music|#}}11&lt;/sup&gt;),
* '''omit5''' (or simply no5) indicates that the (indicated) note should be left out from the chord,

===Special notation===
* In some genres of modern jazz, two chords with a slash between them may indicate an advanced voicing called a [[polychord]], which is the playing of two chords simultaneously.
The correct notation of this should be {{sfrac|F|C}}, and can sometimes get mixed up with the normal altered bass notation. e.g., F/C.

* In guitar-based music, like rock and metal, a "5" indicates that a [[power chord]] should be played. A power chord consists only of the root and the fifth, possibly with the root doubled an octave higher.

===Utilization===
The basic function  of using chord-symbols is to eliminate the need to write notes on a sheet of paper.
The modern jazz-player has extensive knowledge of the chordal functions, and can mostly play music by reading the chord symbols only.
Especially in Jazz music, the advanced chords are common. Altered 9ths, 11ths and 5ths are not that common in pop music.

The interpretation of chord symbols depends on the genre of music being played. In jazz from the [[bebop]] era or later, Major and minor chords are typically voiced as 7th chords even if only "C" or "Cm" appear in the chart. In jazz charts, 7th chords are often voiced with upper extensions, such as the ninth, sharp eleventh and thirteenth, even if the chart only indicates "A&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;". As well, in jazz, the root and fifth are often omitted from chord [[voicing (music)|voicings]], except when there is a diminished fifth or an augmented fifth. The root can be omitted because it is being played by the [[Bass (instrument)|bass]] instrument.

In a pop or rock context, however, "C" and "Cm" would almost always be played as triads, with no sevenths. In pop and rock, in the relatively less common cases where songwriters wish a dominant seventh, major seventh or minor seventh chord, they will indicate this explicitly with the indications "C&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;", "C&lt;sup&gt;maj7&lt;/sup&gt;" or "Cm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;".

Some of the symbols used for chord quality are similar to those used for [[Interval (music)#Shorthand notation|interval quality]]:

==Characteristics==
Within the [[diatonic scale]], every chord has certain characteristics, which include:
* Number of [[pitch class]]es (distinct notes without respect to octave) that constitute the chord.
* [[Degree (music)|Scale degree]] of the root note
*[[Inverted chord|Position or inversion]] of the chord
* General type of intervals it appears constructed from—for example seconds, thirds, or fourths
* Counts of each pitch class as occur between all [[combination]]s of notes the chord contains

Two-note combinations, whether referred to as chords or intervals, are called ''dyads''. Chords constructed of three notes of some underlying [[musical scale|scale]] are described as ''triads''. Chords of four notes are known as ''tetrads'', those containing five are called ''pentads'' and those using six are ''hexads''. Sometimes the terms ''trichord'', ''tetrachord'', ''pentachord'', and ''hexachord'' are used—though these more usually refer to the pitch classes of any scale, not generally played simultaneously. Chords that may contain more than three notes include [[pedal point]] chords, dominant seventh chords, extended chords, added tone chords, [[tone cluster|clusters]], and polychords.

[[Polychord]]s are formed by two or more chords superimposed.&lt;ref&gt;Haerle, Dan (1982). ''The Jazz Language: A Theory Text for Jazz Composition and Improvisation'', p. 30. {{ISBN|978-0-7604-0014-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Often these may be analysed as extended chords; examples include [[tertian]], [[altered chord]], [[secundal|secundal chord]], [[quartal and quintal harmony]] and [[Tristan chord]]). Another example is when G&lt;sup&gt;7({{music|#}}11{{music|b}}9)&lt;/sup&gt; (G–B–D–F–A{{music|b}}–C{{music|#}}) is formed from G major (G–B–D) and D{{music|b}} major (D{{music|b}}–F–A{{music|b}}).&lt;ref&gt;Policastro, Michael A. (1999). ''Understanding How to Build Guitar Chords and Arpeggios'', p. 168. {{ISBN|978-0-7866-4443-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[nonchord tone]] is a [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonant]] or unstable tone that lies outside the chord currently heard, though often [[resolution (music)|resolving]] to a chord tone.&lt;ref&gt;Benward &amp; Saker (2003), p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:C Major scale (up and down).svg|412px|right|thumb|C major scale {{Audio|C major scale.mid|play}}]]

In the key of '''C major''' the first degree of the scale, called the [[tonic (music)|tonic]], is the note '''C''' itself, so a '''C''' major chord, a triad built on the note '''C''', may be called the ''one chord'' of that key and notated in Roman numerals as '''I'''. The same '''C''' major chord can be found in other scales: it forms chord '''III''' in the key of '''A minor''' ('''A'''–''B''–'''C''') and chord '''IV''' in the key of '''G major''' ('''G'''''–A–B–'''''C'''). This numbering lets us see the job a chord is doing in the current key and tonality.

Many analysts use lower-case Roman numerals to indicate minor triads and upper-case for major ones, and ''degree'' and ''plus'' signs ( '''{{music|dim}}''' and '''{{music|aug}}''' ) to indicate diminished and augmented triads respectively. Otherwise all the numerals may be upper-case and the qualities of the chords inferred from the scale degree. Chords outside the scale can be indicated by placing a flat/sharp sign before the chord—for example, the chord of '''E{{music|b}}''' major in the key of '''C''' major is represented by '''{{music|b}}III'''. The tonic of the scale may be indicated to the left (e.g. '''F{{music|#}}:''') or may be understood from a key signature or other contextual clues. Indications of [[Inverted chord|inversions]] or added tones may be omitted if they are not relevant to the analysis. Roman numerals indicate the root of the chord as a [[scale degree]] within a particular major key as follows:

{{Main|Inverted chord}}

In the harmony of Western art music, a chord is in ''root position'' when the tonic note is the lowest in the chord, and the other notes are above it. When the lowest note is not the tonic, the chord is ''inverted''. Chords that have many constituent notes can have many different inverted positions as shown below for the C major chord:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
|-
! Bass note || Position || Order of notes || Notation
|-
! C
|[[root position]]|| C E G or C G E || {{su|p=5|b=3}} as G is a fifth above C and E is a third above C
|-
! E
|[[first inversion]]|| E G C or E C G || {{su|p=6|b=3}} as C is a sixth above E and G is a third above E
|-
! G
|[[second inversion]]|| G C E  or G E C|| {{su|p=6|b=4}} as E is a sixth above G and C is a fourth above G
|}

Further, a four-note chord can be inverted to four different positions by the same method as triadic inversion. For example, a G&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; chord can be in root position (G as bass note); first inversion (B as bass note); second inversion (D as bass note); or third inversion (F as bass note). Where [[guitar chord]]s are concerned the term "inversion" is used slightly differently; to refer to stock fingering "shapes".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bert Weedon]], ''Play in a Day'', Faber Music Ltd, {{ISBN|0-571-52965-8}}, ''passim''  – among a wide range of other guitar tutors&lt;/ref&gt;

Many chords are a sequence of ascending notes separated by intervals of roughly the same size. Chords can be classified into different categories by this size:
* [[Tertian|Tertian chords]] can be decomposed into a series of (major or minor) thirds. For example, the C [[major triad]] (C–E–G) is defined by a sequence of two intervals, the first (C–E) being a major third and the second (E–G) being a [[minor third]]. Most common chords are tertian.
* [[Secundal|Secundal chords]] can be decomposed into a series of (major or minor) seconds. For example, the chord C–D–E{{music|b}} is a series of seconds, containing a [[major second]] (C–D) and a [[minor second]] (D–E{{music|b}}).
* Quartal chords can be decomposed into a series of (perfect or augmented) fourths. Quartal harmony normally works with a combination of perfect and augmented fourths. Diminished fourths are enharmonically equivalent to major thirds, so they are uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;Connie E. Mayfield (2012) "Theory Essentials", p. 523. {{ISBN|1-133-30818-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the chord C–F–B is a series of fourths, containing a [[perfect fourth]] (C–F) and an [[augmented fourth]]/[[tritone]] (F–B).

These terms can become ambiguous when dealing with non-[[diatonic scale]]s, such as the [[Pentatonic scale|pentatonic]] or [[chromatic scale]]s. The use of accidentals can also complicate the terminology. For example, the chord B{{music|#}}–E–A{{music|b}} appears to be quartal, as a series of diminished fourths (B{{music|#}}–E and E–A{{music|b}}), but it is [[enharmonic equivalence|enharmonically equivalent]] to (and sonically indistinguishable from) the tertian chord C–E–G{{music|#}}, which is a series of major thirds (C–E and E–G{{music|#}}).

===Harmonic content===
The notes of a chord form intervals with each of the other notes of the chord in [[combination]].  A 3-note chord has 3 of these harmonic intervals, a 4-note chord has 6, a 5-note chord has 10, a 6-note chord has 15.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Howard. (1960) ''Harmonic Materials of Modern Music'', pp. 7ff. New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts. LOC 58-8138.&lt;/ref&gt;  The absence, presence, and placement of certain key intervals plays a large part in the sound of the chord, and sometimes of the selection of the chord that follows.

A chord containing tritones is called [[Anhemitonic scale|tritonic]]; one without tritones is atritonic. Harmonic tritones are an important part of dominant seventh chords, giving their sound a characteristic tension, and making the tritone interval likely to move in certain stereotypical ways to the following chord.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Horvit, and Nelson (2008). ''Techniques and Materials of Music'', pp. 46–47. {{ISBN|0-495-50054-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tritones are also present in diminished seventh and half-diminished chords.

A chord containing [[semitone]]s, whether appearing as [[Minor second]]s or Major sevenths, is called hemitonic; one without semitones is anhemitonic.  Harmonic semitones are an important part of [[Major seventh chord|Major seventh]] chords, giving their sound a characteristic high tension, and making the harmonic semitone likely to move in certain stereotypical ways to the following chord.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin, Horvit, and Nelson (2008). ''Techniques and Materials of Music'', pp. 48–49. {{ISBN|0-495-50054-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A chord containing Major sevenths but no Minor seconds is much less harsh in sound than one containing Minor seconds as well.

Other chords of interest might include the
* Diminished chord, which has many minor thirds and no major thirds, many tritones but no [[perfect fifth]]s
* [[Augmented chord]], which has many major thirds and no minor thirds or perfect fifths
* [[Dominant seventh diminished five chord]], which has many major thirds and tritones and no minor thirds or perfect fifths

{{See also|Chord names and symbols (jazz and pop music)#Seventh chords|l1=Jazz and pop notation for seventh chords}}
Seventh chords are tertian chords, constructed by adding a fourth note to a triad, at the interval of a third above the fifth of the chord. This creates the interval of a seventh above the root of the chord, the next natural step in composing tertian chords. The seventh chord built on the fifth step of the scale (the dominant seventh) is the only one available in the major scale: it contains all three notes of the diminished triad of the seventh and is frequently used as a stronger substitute for it.

There are various [[Seventh chord#Types of seventh chords|types of seventh chords]] depending on the quality of both the chord and the seventh added. In chord notation the chord type is sometimes superscripted and sometimes not (e.g. ''Dm7'', ''Dm&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''D&lt;sup&gt;m7&lt;/sup&gt;'' are all identical).

==Extended chords==
{{Main|Extended chord}}

[[Image:Upper-structure triad.png|thumb|right|[[Dominant thirteenth chord|Dominant thirteenth]] extended chord: C E G B{{music|b}} D F A {{Audio|Dominant thirteenth chord on C.mid|play}}. The [[upper structure]] or extensions, i.e. notes beyond the seventh, in red. This chord is just a theoretical illustration of this chord. In practice, a jazz pianist or jazz guitarist would not normally play the chord all in thirds as illustrated. Jazz voicings typically use the third, seventh, and then the extensions such as the ninth and thirteenth, and in some cases the eleventh. The root is often omitted from chord voicings, as the bass player will play the root. The fifth is often omitted if it is a perfect fifth. Augmented and diminished fifths are normally included in voicings.]]

Extended chords are triads with further tertian notes added beyond the seventh: the ninth, eleventh, and thirteenth chords. After the thirteenth, any notes added in thirds duplicate notes elsewhere in the chord; all seven notes of the scale are present in the chord, so adding more notes does not add new pitch classes. Such chords may be constructed only by using notes that lie outside the diatonic seven-note scale.

Other extended chords follow similar rules, so that for example ''maj&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''maj&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''maj&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'' contain major seventh chords rather than dominant seventh chords, while ''m&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''m&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;'', and ''m&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;'' contain minor seventh chords.

==Altered chords==
{{Main|Altered chord}}
[[Image:Altered chord on C.png|thumb|Altered chord on C with diminished fifth and minor seventh and ninth. {{Audio|Altered chord on C.mid|Play}}]]
The third and seventh of the chord are always determined by the symbols shown above (the root cannot be so altered without changing the name of the chord, while the third cannot be altered without altering the chord's quality). Nevertheless, the fifth, ninth, eleventh and thirteenth may all be chromatically altered by accidentals. These are noted alongside the altered element. Accidentals are most often used with dominant seventh chords. ''Altered'' dominant seventh chords (C&lt;sup&gt;7alt&lt;/sup&gt;) may have a minor ninth, a sharp ninth, a diminished fifth or an augmented fifth (see Levine's ''Jazz Theory''). Some write this as C&lt;sup&gt;7+9&lt;/sup&gt;, which assumes also the minor ninth, diminished fifth and augmented fifth (see Aebersold's ''Scale Syllabus''). The augmented ninth is often referred to in blues and jazz as a [[blue note]], being enharmonically equivalent to the minor third or tenth. When superscripted numerals are used the different numbers may be listed horizontally (as shown) or else vertically.

==Added tone chords==
{{Main|Added tone chord}}
[[Image:Sus chord.png|thumb|250px|right|[[Suspended chord]] (sus2) and added tone chord ([[ninth|add9]]) both with D ([[octave equivalency|ninth=second]]), distinguished by the absence or presence of the third (E{{music|b}}).&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Stan. "[[Prince (musician)|Prince]]- Harmonic Analysis of '[[Lovesexy|Anna Stesia]]'", pp. 329, 334n7, ''Popular Music'', Vol. 11, No. 3 (Oct., 1992), pp. 325–35.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An added tone chord is a triad chord with an added, non-tertian note, such as the commonly added sixth as well as chords with an added second (ninth) or fourth (eleventh) or a combination of the three. These chords do not include "intervening" thirds as in an extended chord. Added chords can also have variations. Thus ''m&lt;sup&gt;add9&lt;/sup&gt;'', ''m&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' are minor triads with extended notes.

[[Sixth chord]]s can belong to either of two groups. One is [[first inversion]] chords and added sixth chords that contain a sixth from the root.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Michael (2005). ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Music Theory'', p. 119. {{ISBN|978-1-59257-437-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The other group is inverted chords in which the interval of a sixth appears above a bass note that is not the root.&lt;ref&gt;Piston, Walter (1987). ''Harmony'' (5th ed.), p. 66. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-95480-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major sixth chord (also called, ''sixth'' or ''added sixth'' with the chord notation ''6'', e.g., ''C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'') is by far the most common type of sixth chord of the first group. It comprises a major triad with the added [[major sixth]] above the root, common in popular music.&lt;ref name="B&amp;S"/&gt; For example, the chord ''C&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' contains the notes C-E-G-A. The minor sixth chord (''min&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' or ''m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'', e.g., ''Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'') is a minor triad, still with a major 6. For example, the chord ''Cm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' contains the notes C-E{{music|b}}-G-A}}.

The [[augmented sixth chord]] usually appears in chord notation as its enharmonic equivalent, the seventh chord. This chord contains two notes separated by the interval of an augmented sixth (or, by inversion, a diminished third, though this inversion is rare). The augmented sixth is generally used as a dissonant interval most commonly used in motion towards a dominant chord in root position (with the root doubled to create the octave the augmented sixth chord resolves to) or to a tonic chord in second inversion (a tonic triad with the fifth doubled for the same purpose). In this case, the tonic note of the key is included in the chord, sometimes along with an optional fourth note, to create one of the following (illustrated here in the key of C major):
* Italian augmented sixth: A{{music|b}}, C, F{{music|#}}
* French augmented sixth: A{{music|b}}, C, D, F{{music|#}}
* German augmented sixth: A{{music|b}}, C, E{{music|b}}, F{{music|#}}

The augmented sixth family of chords exhibits certain peculiarities. Since they are not based on triads, as are seventh chords and other sixth chords, they are not generally regarded as having roots (nor, therefore, inversions), although one [[chord voicing|re-voicing]] of the notes is common (with the namesake interval inverted to create a diminished third).&lt;ref&gt;Bartlette, Christopher, and Steven G. Laitz (2010).  Graduate Review of Tonal Theory.  New York: Oxford University Press.  {{ISBN|978-0-19-537698-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second group of sixth chords includes inverted major and minor chords, which may be called ''sixth'' chords in that the ''six-three'' ({{su|p=6|b=3}}) and ''six-four'' ({{su|p=6|b=4}}) chords contain intervals of a sixth with the bass note, though this is not the root. Nowadays this is mostly for academic study or analysis (see figured bass) but the [[Neapolitan sixth|neapolitan sixth chord]] is an important example; a major triad with a flat supertonic scale degree as its root that is called a "sixth" because it is almost always found in first inversion. Though a technically accurate Roman numeral analysis would be {{flat}}II, it is generally labelled N&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. In C major, the chord is notated (from root position) D{{music|b}}, F, A{{music|b}}. Because it uses chromatically [[altered tone]]s this chord is often grouped with the borrowed chords but the chord is not borrowed from the relative major or minor and it may appear in both major and minor keys.

==Suspended chords==
{{Main|Suspended chord}}
[[Image:Sus4 chord on C.png|thumb|Sus4 chord on C {{Audio|Sus4 chord on C.mid|play}}]]
A suspended chord, or "sus chord" (sometimes wrongly thought to mean ''sustained chord''), is a chord in which the ''third'' is replaced by either the ''second'' or the ''fourth''.  This produces two main chord types: the ''suspended second'' (sus2) and the ''suspended fourth'' (sus4). The chords, '''C&lt;sup&gt;sus2&lt;/sup&gt;''' and '''C&lt;sup&gt;sus4&lt;/sup&gt;''', for example, consist of the notes ''C D G'' and ''C F G'', respectively.  There is also a third type of suspended chord, in which both the second and fourth are present, for example the chord with the notes ''C D F G.''

The name ''[[suspension (music)|suspended]]'' derives from an early [[polyphonic]] technique developed during the [[common practice period]], in which a stepwise melodic progress to a harmonically stable note in any particular part was often momentarily delayed or ''suspended'' by extending the duration of the previous note. The resulting unexpected dissonance could then be all the more satisfyingly resolved by the eventual appearance of the displaced note. In traditional music theory the inclusion of the ''third'' in either chord would negate the suspension, so such chords would be called ''added ninth'' and ''added eleventh'' chords instead.

In modern layman usage the term is restricted to the displacement of the ''third'' only and the dissonant ''second'' or ''fourth'' no longer needs to be held over (''prepared'') from the previous chord. Neither is it now obligatory for the displaced note to make an appearance at all though in the majority of cases the conventional stepwise resolution to the ''third'' is still observed. In [[post-bop]] and [[modal jazz]] compositions and improvisations suspended seventh chords are often used in nontraditional ways: these often do not function as '''V''' chords, and do not resolve from the fourth to the third. The lack of resolution gives the chord an ambiguous, static quality. Indeed, the third is often played on top of a sus4 chord. A good example is the jazz standard, ''[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]''.

Extended versions are also possible, such as the ''seventh suspended fourth'', which, with root ''C'', contains the notes ''C F G B{{music|b}}'' and is notated as '''C&lt;sup&gt;7sus4&lt;/sup&gt;''' {{Audio|7sus4 chord on C.mid|play}}. '''C&lt;sup&gt;sus4&lt;/sup&gt;''' is sometimes written '''C&lt;sup&gt;sus&lt;/sup&gt;''' since the sus4 is more common than the sus2.

==Borrowed chords==
{{Main|Borrowed chord}}
[[Image:Borrowed chords 1b.gif|thumb|300px|right|Borrowed chords from the parallel minor key are commonly found in the Baroque, Classical and Romantic eras.]]
A [[borrowed chord]] is one from a different key than the ''home key'', the key of the piece it is used in. The most common occurrence of this is where a chord from the [[Parallel key|parallel major or minor]] key is used. Particularly good examples can be found throughout the works of composers such as [[Schubert]]. For instance, for a composer working in the C major key, a major {{music|b}}III chord (e.g., an E{{music|b}} major chord) would be borrowed, as this chord appears only in the C minor key. Although borrowed chords could theoretically include chords taken from any key other than the home key, this is not how the term is used when a chord is described in formal [[musical analysis]].

When a chord is analysed as "borrowed" from another key it may be shown by the Roman numeral corresponding with that key after a slash. For example, '''V/V''' (pronounced "five of five") indicates the dominant chord of the dominant key of the present home-key. The dominant key of '''C''' major is ''' G''' major so this [[secondary dominant]] is the chord of the fifth degree of the '''G''' major scale, which is '''D''' major (which can also be described as '''II''' relative to the key of C major, not to be confused with the [[supertonic]] '''ii''' namely D ''minor''.). If used for a significant duration, the use of the D major chord may cause a [[Modulation (music)|modulation]] to a new key (in this case to G major).

Borrowed chords are widely used in Western popular music and rock music. For example, there are a number of songs in E major which use the {{music|b}}III chord (e.g., a G major chord used in an E major song), the {{music|b}}VII chord  (e.g., a D major chord used in an E major song) and the {{music|b}}VI chord (e.g., a C major chord used in an E major song). All of these chords are "borrowed" from the key of E minor.

'''Conflict continuum''' is a model or concept used by various [[Social sciences|social science]] researchers in modelling conflict, usually going from low "irritations" to high "explosiveness" intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.uiowa.edu/pimgr/?get=conflict |title=Conflict Management |accessdate=2010-11-30 |date=26 July 2007 |publisher=The University of Iowa |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002222238/https://research.uiowa.edu/pimgr/?get=conflict |archivedate=2 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; These conceptual models facilitate discussion as in "anywhere on the conflict continuum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Ruoti | first1 = Tony | title = C412 INTEROPERABILITY: Operational Art in a New Paradigm | publisher = NAVAL WAR COLLEGE | date = 18 June 1993 | location = Newport, RI. | pages = ii | url = http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADA266739 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hart | first1 = Louis B. | title = Learning from Conflict: A Handbook for Trainers and Group Leaders | chapter = 4.

==Various continuum models==

=== Elise Boulding's conflict continuum===
[[Elise M. Boulding]] was a Quaker sociologist influenced by the events of World War II. Examining how war becomes peace, she posited a continuum between Wars of Extermination &lt;ref name="HockerW"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hocker, Joyce &amp; William W. Wilmot | title = Interpersonal Conflict, 4th Edition | year = 1995 | publisher = Brown &amp; Benchmark, Madison }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Transformation.&lt;ref name="GLorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-leader.org/gl_history_gmrs.htm |title=History |year=2001 |publisher=The Institute for Global Leadership |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uxd3ekHA?url=http://www.global-leader.org/gl_history_gmrs.htm |archivedate=14 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is Boulding’s conflict continuum:&lt;ref name="HockerW" /&gt;  War of extermination, Limited war, Threat systems (deterrence), Arbitration, Mediation, Negotiation (exchange), Mutual adaptation, Alliance, Co-operation, Integration,&lt;ref name="HockerW" /&gt; Transformation.&lt;ref name="GLorg" /&gt;

===Andra Medea===
{{COI|section|date=March 2013}}
{{primary sources|section|date=March 2013}}
Theorist [[Andra Medea]] seeks to explain how [[individuals]], small groups, [[organizations]], [[family|families]], [[ethnicities]], and even whole [[nations]] function when disputes arise between them. She posits that there are four types or levels of conflict, each operating under distinct rules: 1) ''Problem Solving''; 2) ''Domination''; 3) ''Blind Behavior''; 4) ''Rogue Messiah''.&lt;ref&gt;Andra Medea interviewed by McDonnell, Jerome. [http://www.wbez.org/episode-segments/may-6-1999 "WorldView"]. WBEZ, Chicago. 16 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level moving from first to fourth is characterized by increasing degrees of separation from reality, and decreasing degrees of maturity, in this context, defined as the ability to control anger and settle differences without violence or destruction. Problem-solving behavior is based in reality and maturity, and is therefore more rational and mature than domination. Domination is more rational and mature than blind behavior, which is more rational and mature than the Rogue Messiah.&lt;ref name="AMbookA"&gt;Medea, Andra. “The Conflict Continuum.”  Chicago, 1996. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, each level moving from fourth to first is more capable than the one below it at forcing victory in a conflict. The Rogue Messiah overpowers blind behavior, blind behavior thwarts domination, and domination deadlocks Problem-solving.&lt;ref name="AMbookA" /&gt;

'''Container port design process''' is a set of correlated practices considered during [[container port]] design, aiming to transfer general business mission into detailed design documents for future construction and operation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pianc.org/edits/articleshop.php?id=2014135|title=PIANC - Technical Report article|last=bvba|first=Consonant|website=www.pianc.org|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design process involves both conceptual design and detailed design.

== Funding ==

The source of funding determines the mission and scope of the project. Choices include federal funding (subsidies),&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N.; Kent, J. (2001). ''Perverse subsidies: how tax dollars can undercut the environment and the economy''. Washington, DC: Island Press. {{ISBN|1-55963-835-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;, state or local funding, and private funding. 

American ports require subsidies from the federal government in order to keep up with advances in maritime transportation as well as the capabilities of the inland freight movement.  Often, roughly 50% of the costs every year come from federal sources.  The [[American Association of Port Authorities]] (AAPA) is an association which aims at ensuring and increasing federal funds to American ports.

A few federal bills which provide funding for ports are 
* Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act: $11 billion in funding to assist in surface transportation improvements
* National Highway Freight Program (NHFP): at least $10 billion in funding reorganized for more efficient use in transportation improvements&lt;ref name="POW Master Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic Master Plan for the Diamond State Port Corporation|url=http://portofwilmington.com/images/DSPC%20Master%20Plan%20-%20FINAL%20-%2007%2029%2016.pdf|website=Port of Wilmington|accessdate=4 December 2016|ref=POW Master Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often, the State's Department of Transportation (DOT) is the largest state/local financier of public money investments.  The DOTs see the ports as key elements in the systems of movement that they are responsible for such as railways and highways.

Investment from private entities is critical to the creation and execution of port activities.  American ports are often run by private entities in the sense that day-to-day functions are financed and managed with the primary goal of creating revenue.  The municipalities of the terminals are kept up by the Port Authority but the equipment and infrastructure required for operations are under the private entities' power.

With the creation of new ports, often [[Public-Private Partnerships]], otherwise known as 3P, are formed to bring in the upfront capital necessary for someone to take on the financial risk of operating a terminal.  Container terminals are no different in this sense from other types of terminals.

==Cargo ==
[[File:Container sizes.jpeg|thumb|112x112px|Container types in consideration]]

Cargo determines the main function, transportation mode and related characters required for the container port. In container port design, the object cargo is [[intermodal container]]. Containers are usually classified as 20-foot and 40-foot. 53-foot containers were introduced and used both in the U.S.A. and Canada, mainly for domestic road and rail transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exportlogisticsguide.com/apl-introduces-53-foot-ocean-containers|title=APL Introduces 53 Foot Ocean Containers|date=2013-11-04|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104235508/http://exportlogisticsguide.com/apl-introduces-53-foot-ocean-containers|archivedate=2013-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{For|container transportation|Intermodal freight transport}}

== Vessels ==
[[File:Container Terminal Tollerort 02.jpg|alt=oversized vessel will not be available to unload cargo.|thumb|Container Vessel in Different size]]

The type of vessel, its dimension and capacity, determines the required capacity for a port's input capacity, which involves berth design, water-borne handling equipment selection and requirements for both storage and land-mode capacity.

The characteristics of vessels and the port characteristics:
* Main dimensions:
** length, which determines the widths and bends of channel, size required for the terminal and maximum number of berths;
** [[Breadth (nautical)|breadth]] and [[air draft]], which influences cargo-handing equipment selection,  and the width of channels;
** [[Hull (watercraft)|draft]], which determines the depth along berths.
* Cargo Capacity, which control over the cargo ship requirements (minimum) of storage, and can affect the loading and unloading processing, usually cranes/ship.
* Designed vessel Function. whether vessel has cargo handling equipment/ how it load cargo. Usually container vessel require external handling equipment.
* Vessel routine shall also get considered as the inter-modal capability requirement for import, export and trans-ship service will be different.

The selection of designed vessel shall also consider the development of the container ship. Underestimating the trend of size development of container ship will result in incapability and low sustainability.

== Location ==
[[File:Triple Bottom Line graphic.jpg|thumb|3BL principle for container port design]]

It should start with data collection and get finished by receiving government permits. The choice of location is considered with philosophy of [[Triple bottom line|triple-bottom line]] and with considerations of waterside access, natural conditions, inter-modal connections and stakeholders.

For ports&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Promotion of the advanced development of urban and regional economy;  
* The requirement of vessel's manoeuvring, [[Brake|braking]], harbor navigation, berthing operations; 
* Greenfield site for general port development, such as new quays, reclamation or [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. 
For container terminals&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* The availability of [[Deep Water Bay|deep water]]; 
* The environmental site conditions including [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] conditions; 
* The availability of land; 
* Good inland transport link or intermodal connections; 
* The [[Soil conditioner|soil conditions]]

=== Waterside Access ===
Waterside access is the condition of waterways in the location, which determines the expected depth, berth quantities, vessel accessibility and effort required for development. Access channel is a waterway that linking the basins of a port to the open sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomastelford.com|title=Thomas Telford Ltd.|website=www.thomastelford.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of location of access channels is that it determines the [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] factors such as wave, [[tidal cycle]], current, wind met by the ships in the channel. Also, it needs to keep the depth of [[Channel (geography)|channel]] and be able to accommodate the world's largest cargo vessels. For example, in order to meet the need, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] runs the Main Navigation Channel Deepening Program, dredged 38 miles of federal channels to as deep as 50 feet by 30 years. There are several aspects, based on PIANC (1997), a designer needs to consider:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pianc.org|title=PIANC Report N 135-2014|last=bvba|first=Consonant|date=|website=www.pianc.org|publisher=|access-date=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Vessel's dimension and velocity; 
# The cargo hazard level; 
# The traffic density; 
# The physical environmental conditions consisting of wind, waves, currents, tidal range, as well as the hardness of the bottom surface.

=== Natural conditions ===
Natural conditions are classified as whether the area selected is developed or natural. Natural condition determines whether there will be existing utilities and constraint for future terminal development.

=== Intermodal connections  ===
Intermodal connection is a place where [[Rail transport|rail]], [[truck]], [[barge]], and other transport methods converge. Intermodal connection for container terminal mainly consists of road and rail. The capacity of [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal connection]]---docking and the handling, storage and transfer of cargo---determines the capability of terminal cargo transportation to/from the land.

== Stakeholders ==
Stakeholders as any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives.(R. Edward Freeman 1984.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management|last=Freeman|first=R. Edward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-15174-0|location=UK|pages=292|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stakeholder analysis is a process of systematically gathering and analyzing qualitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account when developing and or implementing a policy or program. The purpose of a stakeholder analysis is to assess the attitudes of the stakeholders regarding the realization of a new container terminal.

Stakeholder in location selection mainly consist of trade organizations, maritime groups, regional government, neighborhood societies, environment groups and other people with direct/indirect interest related to the terminal. Selection shall involve their participation so as to avoid strong conflicts in future development, and to keep terminal development adapt to the changing demand from these stakeholders.

Agencies and societies involves in this process are:
# [[Port authority|Port Authority]]
# [[Municipality]]
# [[Province]]
# [[Federal government of the United States|National Government]]
# Residents
# Potential Operators
# [[Environmentalist]]

== Permits ==
Permits are crucial in the designing process. Large scale development projects that have the potential for causing significant adverse environmental impacts need permits to start operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polb.com/economics/contractors/forms_permits/development.asp|title=Port of Long Beach - Harbor Development Permit Applications|website=www.polb.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects without permits will be identified as offence. Port needs port permits to open. Port Permits are granted automatically from the Guard at the entrance to the Castle/Palace/Doge Estate in the player's capital city once he reaches the required fame needed to obtain it. Environmental permits will be issued by Local Environmental Protection Agencies. Usually include three part: water side, land side and air emissions. Permits for ports should include: clean air permit, construction permit, discharge permit, dredge permits and water discharge permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/|title=US Environmental Protection Agency|last=EPA|first=US|website=www3.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detailed design==

The consideration of infrastructure includes plans for deployment and construction of infrastructures to implement the functions of terminal. The [[wharf]] at a terminal is the structure which forms the edge of the landside facility.  It is made up of both the topside and the face. The face of the wharf is where equipment is mounted to allow vessels to berth.  It is also designed to be within the high water levels, thus making its structures susceptible to corrosion.  Water-tightness and corrosion protection are a must for any structural elements that make up the face. The topside of the wharf is what is broken down into berths.  Pre-designated lengths of the wharf are separated into identified berths based on the design vessels characteristics.  [[Container crane]]s operate along the wharf when vessels have berthed.

[[Warehouse]]s are created at container terminals to hold specific goods that are transported to the port but are not being shipped out in the same container.  This style of transport is not common, however, this can be service supplied by the terminal owners to increase imports.  Those goods, when warehoused, incur additional handling and storage costs increasing revenue as well.

[[Maintenance management professional|Maintenance]] is the conception that uses engineering theories and practices, risk management and maintenance strategy to plan and implement routine maintenance of facilities and operation systems. The overall maintenance policy for port or terminal should be to maintain all of the facility assets to the extent that the level of expenditure is justified, in order that the assets remain serviceable during their design life or longer and for reasons of safety and security.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A typical maintenance team involves experienced personnel under the control of a qualified engineering maintenance manager and supervisory staff and engineering inspection staff. It should meet requirements listed in ISM ([[International Safety Management Code]]).The maintenance facilities required will include a workshop with sufficient space to work on approximately 10% of the mobile equipment and spreaders at any one time. The maintenance facilities should be located outside but close to the container yard. It is necessary to provide a Stores section within the maintenance facility that will hold necessary spare components and materials. Following are the specific requirements for maintenance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Planned preventive maintenance and statutory inspections of equipment are normally carried out during the day shift when all specialist trades are available. Outside of the day shift minimal manning levels are normally retained to cover breakdowns and emergency repairs only. For other specialist areas such as IT and electronics it is usual to retain specialised personnel due to the specific needs of such systems and equipment. Mechanical and electrical engineering and IT personnel will be responsible for the daily maintenance of cargo handling equipment and other aspects of the facility that require these skills and for specific IT operating systems such as the TOS. High voltage electrical cables and switchgear should be maintained by specialist contractors whilst maintenance of low and medium cables and domestic electrics can be undertaken by electrical tradesmen.

A lay down area is the space where container handling equipment place full or empty containers prior to loading onto the containers' next step in its journey to its destination.  The lay down area is composed of multiple structural layers to support the loads brought on by the equipment and cargo. The first layer, the foundation, consists of either the existing or improved [[subgrade]] of the location.  To add extra strength to the foundation,  the existing soils are compacted further, Soil Improvements such as stone columns are installed, or the unsatisfactory soils are removed and a new fill soil is brought in, graded, and compacted to meet requirements.

The second layer is the asphalt paving.  This pavement differs from typical highway and road pavement as the loads are generally more stationary as well as much smaller in magnitude.  This type of pavement contains Hydraulically Bound Materials (HBM), an ingredient used to provide higher compressive strength to the asphalt.  The mixture is the first part of designing the asphalt with the second being the thickness.  Both the materials and the thickness can be calculated by following existing design guides published by engineering societies.  The [[World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure]]'s (PIANC) Report 165-2015 can provide further guidance on container terminal pavements.&lt;ref name="PIANC Pavements"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Design and Maintenance of Container Terminal Pavements|journal=PIANC|date=2015|volume= Report 165|ref=135-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lay down area surface is also designed for multiple functions.  The pavement must drain towards a drainage system as well as have a sufficient grip to prevent skidding .  Finally, the pavement is painted to show lanes for travel as well as rows to place [[Intermodal container]] containers when not in transit.

Intermodal yards are mainly consisted of two parts, rail yards and container storage yards. Rail yards should have access to rails and container storage yards should have access to trucks. Container storage yards include yards for inbound containers with cargo and internal movements, yards for outbound containers with cargo, yards for trans-shipment containers and yards for empties. The area requirements are measured in TEU ground slots (the area required for one 20-ft container) plus operating space for equipment that transfers containers to and from the yards and that stack and deliver containers.

== Port security ==
[[Port security]] consists of cargo security, port facility security,staff security and maritime domain security. Port security should be worked jointly by the coast guards and custom and border protection together. Internationally, port security is governed by rules issued by the [[International Maritime Organization]] and its 2002 [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code]].

During design process, ports need to come up with a port security plan and implement it. The port security plan should include: security survey and risk assessment, physical security and access control, information security, personnel security, maritime terrorism, drug smuggling, stowaways and alien smuggling, roles/ responsibilities/ legal authorities of port agencies, sea robbery, cargo security and hazardous materials and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/16000/16900/16918/PB2000106164.pdf|title=Port Security- A National Planning Guide|last=U.S. Department of Transportation|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Customs facility ==
Customs should have both base offices at the warehouse and around the gates. The office at the warehouse is mainly for detecting harmful agriculture and smuggling (drugs, dirty money). Office at gates are mainly for the reason of detecting mis-picked cargo or radiation containers. At gates there should be radiation-detection equipments aim at detecting dangerous weapons and radiation stuff that can be used to make dirty bombs. [[Radiation Portal Monitor]]s (RPMs) are passive radiation detection devices used for the screening of individuals, vehicles, cargo or other vectors for detection of illicit sources such as at borders or secure facilities. Portal VACIS imaging system helps trained operators see the contents of closed containers, assisting them in intercepting weapons, contraband, and other items of interest and verifying shipping manifests. Patented drive-through technology lets trucks drive through the system without stopping, providing an effective solution for high-traffic situations where lengthy manual inspection processes are impractical or undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leidos.com/products/security/portal-vacis|title=Portal VACIS|newspaper=Leidos|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mooring ==
[[Mooring (watercraft)]] infrastructure at a port describes those structures that mooring lines from vessels can tie off to in order to prevent drifting along or away from the wharf face.  The mooring structures are called [[cleat (nautical)]] or [[bollards]], depending on their size and shape.  Bollards are designed to handle much larger loads, and in turn, much larger vessels.  Manufacturers of these items typically design the items and supply the finished design to the consultant to include in the bid documents.

Cleats and bollards can be found on all different forms of structures.  The common one is the wharf face of a terminal.  Other locations can include dolphins, which are stand alone structures that are off the face of the landside infrastructure.  Another source can be other barges or sea vessels allowing vessels to tie off to each other.

Bollards and cleats can have multiple types of mooring lines tied off to them.  Bow and stern lines, found at the front and the back of the vessel,  are lines designed to prevent vessels from drifting perpendicular to the berth location.  Breast lines come from closer to the centerline of the vessel and span along the vessel to the mooring location, to keep the vessel from drifting parallel to the berth.  PIANC Report _______  can provide further details on the design of mooring structures.  Bollard and cleat manufacturers can provide more details on dimensions, weights, and capacities of mooring structures&lt;ref name="Maritime International Mooring Catalog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maritime International Mooring Bollards Catalog|url=http://www.maritimeinternational.com/pdfs/Maritime_International_Bollard_Catalog.pdf|website=Maritime International|ref=Maritime International Mooring Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Berthing ==
Berthing of the vessels are analyzed using the design vessels characteristics of weight, draught, and other specification in addition to the requirements set by the terminal location such as wind speeds, direction, currents, and safe berthing velocities of the approach channel and berth.  All these factors come together to determine maximum amounts of energy that must be resisted by the terminal foundation and wharf.  Multiple styles of berthing equipment have been designed in response to this requirement.

Container terminals are for the most part directly on land, eliminating the need for berthing dolphins similar to those described in the Mooring section.  Fender systems installed on the wharf face are the main facility for reducing the amount of energy the wharf structure must absorb during berthing.  A fender system consists of the [[fender (boating)]] itself, the panel, and the various hardware required to anchor and stabilize the unit.

Fenders are made of a grade of rubber chosen for its flexibility.  The more compressible, the more energy the fender can resist.  They come in multiple sizes and shapes, aimed at handling different situations.  Fenders do not need to be mounted in the same location at all times.  Some fenders are designed to rise and fall with water levels.

Panels are large faces that connect to the fender giving more contact space for the vessel.  The size also helps reduce the reaction on the vessel's hull, which is designed for a certain maximum pressure.  They are often covered with a friction reducing surface to prevent lateral forces trying to shear the fender apart.  One final element of panel design is associated not just with its dimensions, but with its location relative to another fender.  The spacing of the fenders relative to the size of the panel must be set so that the design vessel cannot compress the fender in an angled situation and contact the wharf.  Either a second fender panel must be contacted or the fender cannot compress to much in an unsymmetrical fashion.

The structural elements of a fender system must be analyzed ensure equilibrium and stability of each unit at all times.  Chains are installed to keep the panel from putting unnecessary shear due to vessel action or weight of the panel.  Also, anchors are installed into the wharf to anchor the fender to the wharf face.  At these locations, the foundation of the terminal is strengthened more so than at areas of non contact due to the larger forces imparted on the structure.

== Communication ==
Communication is very important in ports because ports are areas with high risks, by good communication people can avoid risks. In the design process, people should consider adding more base stations to ensure good quality of radio contact and video contact. The customs officers should have both radio contact and video contact with truck drivers driving through the gate to make sure they have picked up the right container. Pilots in the port should have good radio communications to guide them sailing. Port labors should have good communication through radio with each other to avoid conflicts and risks.

== Equipment ==
[[File:Melbourne--swanston-dock-container-crane.jpg|thumb|150x150px|waterside container crane in container terminal]]
The consideration of equipment includes plans for procurement and construction of terminal facilities to implement the function of terminal. Equipment involved in detailed design include [[container crane]]s which can be identified by mode: Rail Mounted Quay Crane (RMQC) or Ship to Shore (STS) Crane;   and [[Intermodal container|inter-modal container]] [[Material-handling equipment|transport facilities]] used for storage areas such as [[Reach stacker|Reach Stackers]], Tractor-Trailer Units (TTUs) and Vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Parameters for cranes and inter-modal cargo transport facilities considered in detailed design are: quantities, size limit, power requirement, handling capacity, handling speed, cost, load to land limit, and other working environment constraints.

The deployment of equipment shall be designed with a key mission to create enough cargo transportation to balance the cargo flow. [[Queueing theory]] shall be introduced to the quantity and quality of equipment required.

== Security clearance ==
Because of the characteristics of working at a port, some staff need to have personal security clearance to obtain a job at ports. Like coast guards or customs, because of the ability to have access to classified information. There are three levels of security clearance, confidential, secret and top secret. A critical investigation in it is a background investigation of face-to-face interview with officers. Sometimes staff just need to get interim security clearance. There will also be a periodic reinvestigation every 5 years to obtain a new security clearance. The investigation will again cover key aspects of the individual's life, but will start from one's previous background investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/m/ds/clearances/c10978.htm|title=All About Security Clearances|website=www.state.gov|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labors ===

[[File:Dockworker lashing a container.jpg|thumb|193x193px|container terminal worker]]
In the ports, operating systems and personnel development are based on skills acquired through experience which is easily undertaken in advanced industrial environments.

Several agreements we should take them into account:
* ILO code of practice --- Safety and Health in ports; (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Safety and health in ports|last=ILO|first=ILO|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=2003|isbn=92-2-115287-1|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ILO code of practice --- Security in ports; (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Security in ports|last=ILO|first=ILO|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=2004|isbn=92-2-115286-3|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ILO Maritime Labour Convention (2006)

=== Safety and security ===

''Safety is the condition of a "steady state" of an organization or place . ''Security is the process or means, physical or human, of delaying, preventing, and otherwise protecting against external or internal, defects, dangers, loss, criminals, and other individuals or actions. The main documents related to terminal operations are the [[International Labour Organization|ILO convention]] 152 (1979) and the ILO code of practice (2003) which cope with health and safety of port labor.

=== Logistics ===

[[File:Schematic container-transport chain.png|thumb|Schematic container-transport chain.png]]
Logistics is the general [[supply chain]] of how resources are acquired, stored and transported to their final destination. It involves identifying prospective distributors and [[suppliers]], and determining their effectiveness and accessibility.

=== Customs ===

Customs and Border Protection exists to safeguard country's borders thereby protecting the public from dangerous people and materials while enhancing the nation's global economic competitiveness by enabling legitimate trade and travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/about|title=About CBP {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customs at ports of entry has two main tasks: cargo security and protecting agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/ports-entry|title=At Ports of Entry {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every port should have their own nation's customs. They should have base offices both at the administration building and the warehouse (check agriculture) and outside offices at both the entry gates leaving gates. Groups of customs at port should be consisted of Marine Interdiction Agents, Border Patrol Agents, Agriculture Specialists, Custom and Border Protection Officers and Import Specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/careers/join-cbp|title=Join CBP {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East–West Center''' ('''EWC'''), or the '''Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West''', is an education and research organization established by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1960 to strengthen relations and understanding among the peoples and nations of [[Asia]], the [[Pacific]], and the [[United States]]. It is headquartered in [[Honolulu, Hawaii|Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]].

== History ==
[[File:Honolulu-EWC-JeffersonHall-wide.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Jefferson Hall Conference Center]]
[[File:Honolulu-EWC-Thaipavilion.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Thai Pavilion]]

The East–West Center originated as a [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] faculty initiative with a February 16, 1959, memo from professor [[Murray Turnbull]], then acting Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences, to political science professor Norman Meller, then chairperson of the faculty senate, that proposed the creation of an International College of Cultural Affairs. However, [[University of Hawaii]] President [[Laurence H. Snyder]] stated that budgetary constraints prevented proceeding at the time with the idea.&lt;!--

Two months later, following radio reports of an April 16, 1959 speech in Washington, D.C. by then Sen. [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Lyndon Johnson]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Texas|TX]]) that proposed the creation of an international university in Hawaii "as a meeting place for the intellectuals of the East and the West," history professor John Stalker and Meller urged President Snyder to respond at once to Johnson's suggestion.&lt;!--

On June 9, 1959, Sen. Johnson introduced a bill in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] to establish an educational center in Hawaii to provide for "cultural and technical interchange between East and West," with a companion bill introduced in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] by [[Delegate (United States Congress)|Delegate]] [[John A. Burns]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Territory of Hawaii|T.H.]]);&lt;!--

On May 14, 1960, President Eisenhower signed the Mutual Security Act of 1960 which authorized the creation of a Center for Cultural and Technical Interchange Between East and West (East–West Center) at the University of Hawaii, and on August 31, 1960, signed the Department of State Appropriation Act, 1961, which appropriated $10 million for the Center (including $8.2 million in capital spending for six new buildings), and on September 30, 1961, President [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] signed Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1962, which appropriated an additional $3.3 million for the Center.&lt;!--

  --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kobayashi (1983), pp. 122–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the six buildings were completed and opened in September 1962: Edmondson Hall (a four-story building containing classrooms and laboratories), Kennedy Theatre (an 800-seat theatre), Hale Kuahine (a four-story women's dormitory for 120 students), and Lincoln Hall (a four-story residence hall for senior scholars and faculty).&lt;!--

In 1977, John A. Burns Hall, located south of Hale Manoa on the {{convert|21|acre|m2|adj=on}} East–West Center campus, was completed. The four-story building for administrative offices was designed by architect John Hara to integrate with the style of the other East–West Center buildings (its windows mimic those of Lincoln Hall). It was built with State of Hawaii funds to compensate the federal government for the University's use of Edmondson Hall, the Kennedy Theatre, and the 4-story wing of Moore Hall, which had been built with federal funds for the East–West Center.&lt;!--

==Structure==
EWC program areas include Education, Research, Seminars, a [[Washington, D.C.]] office (which also houses and administers the United States Asia Pacific Council), an Office of External Affairs and the East–West Center Foundation.

===Research Program===
The Research Program conducts studies on economic development, trade, energy, governance, politics, security, conflict reduction, population, health, and environment. Under the Research umbrella is the Pacific Islands Development Program (the research and training arm and regional secretariat of the [[Pacific Islands Conference of Leaders]] representing 22 Pacific island nations).

===Education Program===
The Education Program offers educational opportunities for students and professional development seminars and workshops for educators from the U.S. and the region. The Student Program is carried out in partnership with the University of Hawaii and other universities in Hawaii and the continental U.S. scholarships are awarded annually in an international competition. Also under the Education Program are the [[Asia Pacific Leadership Program]] (APLP) (a certificate program for graduate-level students and mid-level professionals)[http://www.eastwestcenter.org/aplp/], AsiaPacificEd and the Asian Studies Development Program (both work with primary, secondary, and college educators to infuse Asian Pacific content in curricula), and Education 2020 (a focus on new approaches to educational challenges in the Asia Pacific Region). Most of education program participants reside in EWC dormitories like [[Hale Manoa Dormitory]].

===East–West Seminars===
East–West Seminars bring professionals from government, civil society, business and the media together for short-term dialogue and exchange programs to share knowledge and address issues of regional and global concern. Included in the Seminars Program are the Media Program (provides journalist with first-hand examination of issues in the region and the U.S.), Senior Policy Seminar (brings together top level foreign affairs and security officials, private sector and civil society leaders to discuss key regional issues), and the Asia Pacific Executive Forum (brings to American cities discussions on topics that affect the economics and business of the region). The East–West Center also organizes various women empowerment programs. It recently organized 2014 Changing Faces Women’s Leadership Seminar at Hawaii which saw the participation of 13 women entrepreneurs from the Asia Pacific Region.

===Office of External Affairs===
The Office of External Affairs (OEA) connects the resources and research of the EWC with the local, national, and international community through educational outreach, public programs, briefings, and media relations. Within the OEA is the News and Information office (provides EWC research findings, opinion pieces, and analysis of issues to journalists and the public), the Arts Program (presents performances and exhibitions illuminating the cultural values and art forms of national and ethnic traditions in the region), and the Alumni Office (works with an international network of professionals from more than 50 countries who have had a past affiliation with the EWC).

===East–West Center Foundation===
The East–West Center Foundation expands and enhances support for the EWC with private resources that support scholarships, research, and seminar initiatives not covered by core Congressional funding.

==Funding==
Approximately half of Center funding comes from the U.S. government, with additional support provided by private agencies, individuals, foundations, corporations, and the governments of the region. In 2005 the EWC received a total of $37 million (including $19.2 million from the U.S. Congress).

On May 7, 2009, President Barack Obama requested a reduction in federal funding for the EWC, from $21 million in fiscal year 2009 to $12 million for fiscal year 2010.&lt;ref name=wp20110421&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The outcome of the 2010 request was a $2 million increase in the Center's budget.&lt;ref name=wp20110421/&gt;  Subsequently in 2011, a request to reduce the budget by 50% (reduction by $10.7 million) was placed as part of the budget proposal.&lt;ref name=wp20110421/&gt;  The outcome of this request was a $2 million decrease in the Center's budget.&lt;ref name=wp20110421/&gt;

==Impact==
The impact of the EWC is far-reaching. More than 50,000 people have participated in EWC programs since 1960, including many who currently hold positions of leadership throughout the United States and the Asia Pacific. Alumni include heads of government, cabinet members, university and [[NGO]] presidents, corporate and media leaders, educators and individuals prominent in the arts.

==East–West Center Gallery==
The East–West Center Gallery presents changing exhibits of traditional and contemporary arts of the Pacific region.  The gallery is located on the campus of the University of Hawaii, and is open daily except Saturday.  Cultural performances are also presented.

== Hale Manoa Dormitory ==
[[File:Honolulu-EWC-HaleManoa-wide.JPG|thumb|Hale Manoa Dormitory]]

Hale Manoa is the East–West Center's student [[dormitory]].&lt;ref name="Place Names of Hawaii"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fkw4JooFxZAC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;dq=Hale+Manoa+Dormitory&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oW-Aid00G8&amp;sig=LooeaKiMeEVXPcSDs6nf3xxe07I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwksr1qoHKAhVCKGMKHUZFCkU4ChDoAQhHMAc#v=onepage&amp;q=Hale%20Manoa%20Dormitory&amp;f=false | title=Place Names of Hawaii - Hale Manoa | accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This 13-story building, constructed in 1962, was designed by American architect [[I.&amp;nbsp;M. Pei]], and is located in the University of Hawaii, Honolulu.&lt;ref name="Hale Manoa Dormitory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/buildings/128714/hale-manoa-dormitory-honolulu-hi-usa | title=Hale Manoa Dormitory | publisher=Emporis is a global provider of building information | accessdate=29 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dormitory has a housing capacity of more than 400. This is a predominantly [[graduate student]] dormitory and most of the residents are mainly recipients of East West Center scholarships or are affiliated with their programs. Hence here there are [[EWC Graduate Degree Fellows]], [[Asia Pacific Leadership Program]] participants, [[EWC Affiliates]] and others who are not directly funded by the EWC. A large majority of the residents are international students from the Asia-Pacific region like China, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, and Indonesia. Recently, there has been a move to bring in more students from [[South Asian]] countries.

It was an all-male dormitory, whereas a sister dormitory, [[Hale Kuahine]], situated just next to the [[Imin Center]] and also a [[I.&amp;nbsp;M. Pei]] building, housed all the females. Currently, Hale Manoa houses students of both genders.

M., Michel, M. K., &amp; Teti, L. O. (1994). The development of emotion regulation and dysregulation: A clinical perspective. (Vol. 59, pp. 73-100). Wiley-Blackwell. {{jstor|1166139}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be defined as [[extrinsic]] and [[intrinsic]] processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = R.

Emotional regulation is a complex process that involves [[Initiation|initiating]], inhibiting, or modulating one's state or [[Behavior#Psychology|behavior]] in a given situation{{spaced ndash}}for example the subjective experience (feelings), cognitive responses (thoughts), emotion-related physiological responses (for example heart rate or hormonal activity), and emotion-related behavior (bodily actions or expressions). Functionally, emotional regulation can also refer to processes such as the tendency to focus one's attention to a task and the ability to suppress inappropriate behavior under instruction. Emotional regulation is a highly significant function in human life.

Every day, people are continually exposed to a wide variety of potentially arousing [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. Inappropriate, extreme or unchecked emotional reactions to such stimuli could impede functional fit within society; therefore, people must engage in some form of emotion regulation almost all of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Koole, S. L. (2009). The psychology of emotion regulation: An integrative review. (23 ed., Vol. 1, pp. 4-41). Psychology Press. Retrieved from http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02699930802619031&lt;/ref&gt; Generally speaking, [[emotional dysregulation]] has been defined as difficulties in controlling the influence of emotional [[arousal]] on the organization and quality of thoughts, actions, and interactions.

==Theory==

===Process model===
The process model of emotion regulation is based upon the modal model of emotion. The modal model of emotion suggests that the emotion generation process occurs in a particular sequence over time. This sequence occurs as follows:
#Situation: the sequence begins with a situation (real or imagined) that is emotionally relevant.
#[[Attention]]: attention is directed towards the emotional situation.
#[[Cognitive appraisal|Appraisal]]: the emotional situation is evaluated and interpreted.
#Response: an emotional response is generated, giving rise to loosely coordinated changes in experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.
Because an emotional response (4.) can cause changes to a situation (1.), this model involves a feedback loop from (4.) Response to (1.) Situation. This feedback loop suggests that the emotion generation process can occur recursively, is ongoing, and dynamic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Gross, J. J. &amp; Thompson, R. A. (2007). Emotion regulation: Conceptual foundations. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 3-24). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process model contends that each of these four points in the emotion generation process can be subjected to regulation. From this conceptualization, the process model posits five different families of emotion regulation that correspond to the regulation of a particular point in the emotion generation process. They occur in the following order:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = The emerging field of emotion regulation: An integrative review | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 271–299 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.2.3.271}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Situation selection
#Situation modification
#Attentional deployment
#Cognitive change
#Response modulation
The process model also divides these emotion regulation strategies into two categories: antecedent-focused and response-focused. Antecedent-focused strategies (i.e., situation selection, situation modification, attentional deployment, and cognitive change) occur before an emotional response is fully generated. Response-focused strategies (i.e., response modulation) occur after an emotional response is fully generated.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gross | first1 = J. J. | year = 1998 | title = Antecedent- and response-focused emotion regulation: Divergent consequences for experience, expression, and physiology | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 74 | issue = | pages = 224–237 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.74.1.224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategies==

===Situation selection===
Situation selection involves choosing to avoid or approach an emotionally relevant situation. If a person selects to avoid or disengage from an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is decreasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion. Alternatively, if a person selects to approach or engage with an emotionally relevant situation, he or she is increasing the likelihood of experiencing an emotion.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Typical examples of situation selection may be seen interpersonally, such as when a parent removes his or her child from an emotionally unpleasant situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fox | first1 = N. A. | last2 = Calkins | first2 = S. D. | year = 2003 | title = The development of self-control of emotion: Intrinsic and extrinsic influences | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = 1| pages = 7–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Use of situation selection may also be seen in psychopathology. For example, avoidance of social situations to regulate emotions is particularly pronounced for those with [[social anxiety disorder]]&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wells | first1 = A. | last2 = Papageorgiou | first2 = C. | year = 1998 | title = Social phobia: Effects of external attention on anxiety, negative beliefs, and perspective taking | url = | journal = Behavior Therapy | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 357–370 | doi=10.1016/s0005-7894(98)80037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[avoidant personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Effective situation selection is not always an easy task. For instance, humans display difficulties [[Affective forecasting|predicting their emotional responses]] to future events. Therefore, they may have trouble making accurate and appropriate decisions about which emotionally relevant situations to approach or to avoid.&lt;ref&gt;Loewenstein, G. (2007). Affect regulation and affective forecasting. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation ''(pp.180-203). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation modification===
Situation modification involves efforts to modify a situation so as to change its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Situation modification refers specifically to altering one's external, physical environment. Altering one's "internal" environment to regulate emotion is called cognitive change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Examples of situation modification may include injecting humor into a speech to elicit laughter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hofmann | first1 = S. G. | last2 = Gerlach | first2 = A.

===Attentional deployment===
Attentional deployment involves directing one's attention towards or away from an emotional situation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Distraction====
[[Distraction]], an example of attentional deployment, is an early selection strategy, which involves diverting one's attention away from an emotional stimulus and towards other content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = Is timing everything?

This is because distraction easily filters out high-intensity emotional content, which would otherwise be relatively difficult to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sheppes | first1 = G. | last2 = Scheibe | first2 = S. | last3 = Suri | first3 = G. | last4 = Gross | first4 = J.

====Rumination====
[[Rumination (psychology)|Rumination]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; is defined as the passive and repetitive focusing of one's attention on one's symptoms of distress and the causes and consequences of these symptoms. Rumination is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy, as it tends to exacerbate emotional distress. It has also been implicated in a host of disorders including [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nolen-Hoeksema | first1 = S. | last2 = Wisco | first2 = B. E. | last3 = Lyubomirsky | first3 = S. | year = 2008 | title = Rethinking rumination | url = | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 3 | issue = 5| pages = 400–424 | doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00088.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Worry====
[[Worry]], an example of attentional deployment,&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; involves directing attention to thoughts and images concerned with potentially negative events in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borkovec | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Robinson | first2 = E. | last3 = Pruzinsky | first3 = T. | last4 = DePree | first4 = J. A. | year = 1983 | title = Preliminary exploration of worry: Some characteristics and processes | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 9–16 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(83)90121-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By focusing on these events, worrying serves to aid in the downregulation of intense negative emotion and physiological activity.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; While worry may sometimes involve problem solving, incessant worry is generally considered maladaptive, being a common feature of [[anxiety disorders]], particularly [[generalized anxiety disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Borkovec | first1 = T. D. | last2 = Inz | first2 = J. | year = 1990 | title = The nature of worry in generalized anxiety disorder: A predominance of thought activity | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1016/0005-7967(90)90027-g}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thought suppression====
[[Thought suppression]], an example of attentional deployment, involves efforts to redirect one's attention from specific thoughts and mental images to other content so as to modify one's emotional state.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Campbell-Sills, L. &amp; Barlow, D. H. (2007). Incorporating emotion regulation into conceptualizations and treatments of anxiety and mood disorders. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 542-559). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although thought suppression may provide temporary relief from undesirable thoughts, it may ironically end up spurring the production of even more unwanted thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wegner | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Zanakos | first2 = S. | year = 1994 | title = Chronic thought suppression | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 615–640 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1994.tb00311.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy is generally considered maladaptive, being most associated with [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Cognitive change===
Cognitive change involves changing how one appraises a situation so as to alter its emotional meaning.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Reappraisal====
Reappraisal, an example of cognitive change, is a late selection strategy, which involves reinterpreting the meaning of an event so as to alter its emotional impact.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; For example, this might involve reinterpreting an event by broadening one's perspective to see "the bigger picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schartau | first1 = P. E. | last2 = Dalgleish | first2 = T. | last3 = Dunn | first3 = B.

As opposed to distraction, individuals show a relative preference to engage in reappraisal when facing stimuli of low negative emotional intensity because these stimuli are relatively easy to appraise and process.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Reappraisal is generally considered to be an adaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to suppression, which is correlated negatively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; reappraisal can be associated with better interpersonal outcomes, and can be positively related to wellbeing.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Gross, James |author2=John, Oliver |title=Individual differences in two emotion regulation processes: Implications for affect, relationships, and well-being|pmid=12916575|url=http://doi.apa.org/journals/psp/85/2/348.pdf|year=2003|volume=85|issue=2|pages=348–62|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.2.348}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts reappraisal may be maladaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tamir | first1 = M | year = 2009 | title = What do people want to feel and why?

====Distancing====
Distancing, an example of cognitive change, involves taking on an independent, third-person perspective when evaluating an emotional event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ochsner | first1 = K. N. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2008 | title = Cognitive emotion regulation: Insights from social, cognitive, affective neuroscience | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 153–158 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-8721.2008.00566.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distancing has been shown to be an adaptive form of self-reflection, facilitating the emotional processing of negatively valenced stimuli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2009 | title = Asking why from a distance facilitates emotional processing: A reanalysis of Wimalaweera and Moulds (2008) | url = | journal = Behaviour Research and Therapy | volume = 47 | issue = | pages = 88–92 | doi=10.1016/j.brat.2008.06.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing emotional and cardiovascular reactivity to negative stimuli, and increasing problem-solving behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ayduk | first1 = O. | last2 = Kross | first2 = E. | year = 2010 | title = From a distance: Implications of spontaneous self-distancing for adaptive self-reflection | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 98 | issue = 5| pages = 809–829 | doi=10.1037/a0019205 | pmid=20438226 | pmc=2881638}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Humor====
[[Humor]], an example of cognitive change, has been shown to be an effective emotion regulation strategy. Specifically, positive, good-natured humor has been shown to effectively upregulate positive emotion and downregulate negative emotion. On the other hand, negative, mean-spirited humor is less effective in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Samson | first1 = A. C. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2012 | title = Humour as emotion regulation: The differential consequences of negative versus positive humour | url = | journal = Cognition and Emotion | volume = 26 | issue = 2| pages = 375–384 | doi=10.1080/02699931.2011.585069}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response modulation===
Response modulation involves attempts to directly influence experiential, behavioral, and physiological response systems.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

====Expressive suppression====
[[Expressive Suppression|Expressive suppression]], an example of response modulation, involves inhibiting emotional expressions. It has been shown to effectively reduce facial expressivity, subjective feelings of positive emotion, heart rate, and [[Sympathetic nervous system|sympathetic activation]]. However, the research is mixed regarding whether this strategy is effective for downregulating negative emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dan-Glauser | first1 = E. S. | last2 = Gross | first2 = J. J. | year = 2011 | title = The temporal dynamics of two response-focused forms of emotion regulation: Experiential, expressive, and autonomic consequences | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1309–1322 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-8986.2011.01191.x| pmc = 3136552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has also shown that expressive suppression may have negative social consequences, correlating with reduced personal connections and greater difficulties forming relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Egloff | first2 = B. | last3 = Wlhelm | first3 = F. H. | last4 = Smith | first4 = N. C. | last5 = Erickson | first5 = E. A. | last6 = Gross | first6 = J.

Expressive suppression is generally considered to be a maladaptive emotion-regulation strategy. Compared to reappraisal, it is correlated positively with many psychological disorders,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; associated with worse interpersonal outcomes, is negatively related to wellbeing,&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; and requires the mobilization of a relatively substantial amount of cognitive resources.&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Richards|first=Jane|title=The Cognitive Consequences of Concealing Feelings|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=August 2004|volume=13|issue=4|pages=131–134|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00291.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some researchers argue that context is important when evaluating the adaptiveness of a strategy, suggesting that in some contexts suppression may be adaptive.&lt;ref name="Tamir, M. 2009"/&gt;

====Drug use====
[[Drug]] use, an example of response modulation, can be a way to alter emotion-associated physiological responses. For example, [[Ethanol|alcohol]] can produce [[sedative]] and [[anxiolytic]] effects&lt;ref&gt;Sher, K. J. &amp; Grekin, E. R. (2007). Alcohol and affect regulation. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 560-580). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[beta blockers]] can affect sympathetic activation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Exercise====
[[Exercise]], an example of response modulation, can be used to downregulate the physiological and experiential effects of negative emotions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Regular physical activity has also been shown to reduce emotional distress and improve emotional control.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oaten|first=Megan|author2=Cheng, Ken|title=Longitudinal gains in self-regulation from regular physical exercise|journal=British Journal of Health Psychology|year=2006|volume=11|issue=4|pages=717–733|doi=10.1348/135910706X96481}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sleep====
[[Sleep]] plays a role in emotion regulation, although stress and worry can also interfere with sleep. Studies have shown that sleep, specifically [[REM sleep]], down-regulates reactivity of the [[amygdala]], a brain structure known to be involved in the processing of emotions, in response to previous emotional experiences.&lt;ref name="walker"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=Matthew P. |date=March 2009 |title=The Role of Sleep in Cognition and Emotion |url=http://walkerlab.berkeley.edu/reprints/Walker_NYAS_2009.pdf |journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences |volume=1156 |pages=168–197 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04416.x |access-date=25 November 2015 |pmid=19338508}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the flip side, [[sleep deprivation]] is associated with greater emotional reactivity or overreaction to negative and stressful stimuli. This is a result of both increased amygdala activity and a disconnect between the amygdala and the [[prefrontal cortex]], which regulates the amygdala through inhibition, together resulting in an overactive emotional brain.&lt;ref name="walker"/&gt; Due to the subsequent lack of emotional control, sleep deprivation may be associated with depression, [[impulsivity]], and mood swings. Additionally, there is some evidence that sleep deprivation may reduce emotional reactivity to positive stimuli and events and impair [[emotion recognition]] in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Beattie |first=Louise |last2=Kyle |first2=Simon D. |last3=Espie |first3=Colin A. |last4=Biello |first4=Stephany M. |date=December 2015 |title=Social interactions, emotion and sleep: A systematic review and research agenda |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079214001579 |journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews |volume=24 |pages=83–100 |doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2014.12.005 |access-date=24 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In psychotherapy==

==Developmental process==
{{See also|Developmental psychology|Social-emotional development in childhood}}

===Infancy===
Intrinsic emotion-regulation efforts during [[infancy]] are believed to be guided primarily by innate physiological response systems.&lt;ref&gt;Derryberr, D., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2001). Early temperament and emotional development. In A. F. Kalverboer &amp; A. Gramsbergen (Eds.), ''Handbook of Brain and Behavior in Human Development'' (pp. 967-988). Dordrecht, The Netherlands: Kluwer Academic.&lt;/ref&gt; These systems usually manifest as an approach towards and an avoidance of pleasant or unpleasant stimuli. At three months, infants can engage in self-soothing behaviors like sucking and can reflexively respond to and signal feelings of distress.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;Rothbart, M., Ziaie, H., &amp; O'Boyle, C. (1992). Self-regulation and emotion in infancy. In N. Eisenberg, &amp; R. Fabes (Eds.), ''Emotion and Its Regulation in Early Development'' (pp. 7-23). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass/Pfeiffer.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, infants have been observed attempting to suppress anger or sadness by knitting their brow or compressing their lips.&lt;ref name="Malatesta et. al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malatesta|first=C.Z.|author2=Grigoryev, P. |author3=Lamb, C. |author4=Albin, M. |author5=Culver, C. |title=Emotional socialization and expressive development in preterm and full-term infants|journal=Child Development|year=1986|volume=57|pages=316–330|doi=10.2307/1130587|pmid=3956316|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between three and six months, basic [[Motor skills|motor functioning]] and attentional mechanisms begin to play a role in emotion regulation, allowing infants to more effectively approach or avoid emotionally relevant situations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G. | last2 = Coy | first2 = K.

Extrinsic emotion-regulation efforts by caregivers, including situation selection, modification, and distraction, are particularly important for infants.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;Calkins, S. D., &amp; Hill, A. (2007). Caregiver influence on emerging emotion regulation: Biological and environmental transactions in early development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 229-248). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The emotion regulation strategies employed by caregivers to attenuate distress or to upregulate positive affect in infants can impact the infants' emotional and behavioral development, teaching them particular strategies and methods of regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, L. A. (1996). ''Emotional development: The organization of emotional life in the early years''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The type of [[Attachment styles|attachment style]] between caregiver and infant can therefore play a meaningful role in the regulatory strategies infants may learn to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kochanska | first1 = G | year = 2001 | title = Emotional development in children with different attachment histories: The first three years | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 474–490 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent evidence supports the idea that maternal singing has a positive effect on affect regulation in infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trehub | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Ghazban | first2 = N. | last3 = Corbeil | first3 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Musical affect regulation in infancy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1337 | issue = 1| pages = 186–192 | doi=10.1111/nyas.12622 | pmid=25773634}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing play-songs, such as "The Wheels on the Bus" or "She'll Be Comin' Round the Mountain" have a visible affect-regulatory consequence of prolonged positive affect and even alleviation of distress. In addition to proven facilitation of social bonding, when combined with movement and/or rhythmic touch, maternal singing for affect regulation has possible applications for infants in the NICU and for adult caregivers with serious personality or adjustment difficulties.

===Toddler-hood===
By the end of the first year, [[toddler]]s begin to adopt new strategies to decrease negative arousal. These strategies can include rocking themselves, chewing on objects, or moving away from things that upset them.&lt;ref name="Kopp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopp|first=C.B.|title=Regulation of distress and negative emotions|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=1989|volume=25|pages=343–354|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; At two years, toddlers become more capable of actively employing emotion regulation strategies.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; They can apply certain emotion regulation tactics to influence various emotional states.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Additionally, maturation of brain functioning and language and motor skills permits toddlers to manage their emotional responses and levels of arousal more effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Rueda, M. R., Posner, M. I., &amp; Rothbart, M. K. (2004). Attentional control and self-regulation. In R. F. Baumeister &amp; K. D. Vohs (Eds.),'' Handbook of self-regulation: Research, theory, and applications ''(pp. 283-300). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrinsic emotion regulation remains important to emotional development in toddlerhood. Toddlers can learn ways from their caregivers to control their emotions and behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kopp | first1 = C. | year = 1989 | title = Regulation of distress and negative emotions: A developmental view | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 243–254 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.25.3.343}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, caregivers help teach self-regulation methods by distracting children from unpleasant events (like a [[vaccination]] shot) or helping them understand frightening events.&lt;ref name="Thompson, 1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=R.A.|title=Emotional regulation: A theme in search of definition|journal=Monographs of Society for Research in Child Development|year=1994|volume=59|pages=2–3|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5834.1994.tb01276.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Childhood===
Emotion-regulation knowledge becomes more substantial during childhood. For example, children aged six to ten begin to understand [[display rules]]. They come to appreciate the contexts in which certain emotional expressions are socially most appropriate and therefore ought to be regulated. For example, children may understand that upon receiving a gift they should display a smile, irrespective of their actual feelings about the gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = P. L. | year = 1983 | title = Children's understanding of the link between situation and emotion | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Child Psychology | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1016/0022-0965(83)90048-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During childhood, there is also a trend towards the use of more cognitive emotion regulation strategies, taking the place of more basic distraction, approach, and avoidance tactics.&lt;ref&gt;Stegge, H. &amp; Terwog, M. M. (2007). Awareness and regulation of emotion in typical and atypical development. In J. J. Gross (Ed.), ''Handbook of Emotion Regulation'' (pp. 269-286). New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the development of emotion dysregulation in children, one robust finding suggests that children who are frequently exposed to negative emotion at home will be more likely to display, and have difficulties regulating, high levels of negative emotion.&lt;ref name="Caspi et. al, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caspi|first=A.|author2=Moffitt, T.E. |author3=Morgan, J. |author4=Rutter, M. |author5=Taylor, A. |author6=Arseneault, L. |author7=Tully, L. |author8=Jacobs, C. |author9=Kim-Cohen, J. |author10=Polo-Tomas, M. |title=Maternal expressed emotion predicts children's antisocial behaviour problems: Using monozygotic-twin differences to identify environmental effects on behavioural development|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|pages=149–161|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.2.149|pmid=14979757|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenberg, Zhou &amp; Koller, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eisenberg|first=N.|author2=Zhou, Q. |author3=Koller, S. |title=Brazilian adolescents' prosocial moral judgement and behaviour: Relations to sympathy, perspective-taking, gender-role orientation, and demographic characteristics|journal=Child Development|year=2001|volume=72|pages=518–534|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00294|pmid=11333082|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maughan &amp; Cicchetti"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maughan|first=A.|author2=Cicchetti, D.|title=Impact of child maltreatment and interadult violence on children's emotional regulation abilities and socioemotional adjustements|journal=Child Development|year=2002|volume=73|pages=1525–1542|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00488|pmid=12361317|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Valiente, Eisenberg &amp; Spinrad, 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Valiente|first=C.|author2=Fabes, R.A. |author3=Eisenberg, N. |author4=Spinrad, T.L. |title=The relations of parental expressivity and support to children's coping with daily stress|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|pages=97–106|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.18.1.97|pmid=14992613|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescence===
[[Adolescence|Adolescents]] show a marked increase in their capacities to regulate their emotions, and emotion-regulation decision making becomes more complex, depending on multiple factors. In particular, the significance of interpersonal outcomes increases for adolescents. When regulating their emotions, adolescents are therefore likely to take into account their social context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Cassano | first2 = M. | last3 = Perry-Parrish | first3 = C. | last4 = Stegall | first4 = S. | year = 2006 | title = Emotion regulation in children and adolescents | url = | journal = Journal of Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics | volume = 27 | issue = 2| pages = 155–168 | doi=10.1097/00004703-200604000-00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, adolescents show a tendency to display more emotion if they expect a sympathetic response from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zeman | first1 = J. | last2 = Garber | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Display rules for anger, sadness, and pain: it depends on who is watching | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 957–973 | doi=10.2307/1131873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, spontaneous use of cognitive emotion-regulation strategies increases during adolescence, which is evidenced both by self-report data&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Garnefski | first1 = N. | last2 = Kraaij | first2 = V. | year = 2006 | title = Relationships between cognitive emotion regulation strategies and depressive symptoms: A comparative study of five specific samples | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1659–1669 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2005.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and neural markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Luna | first1 = B. | last2 = Padmanabhan | first2 = A. | last3 = O'Hearn | first3 = K. | year = 2010 | title = What has fMRI told us about the development of cognitive control through adolescence? | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 101–113 | doi = 10.1016/j.bandc.2009.08.005 | pmc = 2815087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adulthood===
Social losses increase and health tends to decrease as people age. As people get older their motivation to seek emotional meaning in life through social ties tends to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Carstensen | first1 = L. A. L. | last2 = Fung | first2 = H. | last3 = Charlse | first3 = S. | year = 2003 | title = Socioemotional selectivity theory and the regulation of emotion in the second half of life | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 103–123 | doi=10.1023/a:1024569803230}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Autonomic nervous system|Autonomic]] responsiveness decreases with age, and emotion-regulation skill tends to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lawton | first1 = M.

==Overview of perspectives==

===Neuropsychological perspective===

====Affective====
As people age, their [[affect (psychology)|affect]]{{spaced ndash}}the way they react to emotions{{spaced ndash}}changes, either positively or negatively. Studies show that positive affect increases as a person grows from adolescence to their mid 70s. Negative affect, on the other hand, decreases until the mid 70s. Studies also show that emotions differ in adulthood, particularly affect (positive or negative). Although some studies found that affect decreases{{Clarify|reason=Becomes less positive / more negative or rather becomes less extreme, i.e., less positive or less negative as applicable?|date=February 2017}} with age, some have concluded that adults in their middle age experience more positive affect and less negative affect than younger adults. Positive affect was also higher for men than women while the negative affect was higher for women than it was for men and also for single people. A reason that older people{{spaced ndash}}middle adulthood{{spaced ndash}}might have less negative affect is because they have overcome, "the trials and vicissitudes of youth, they may increasingly experience a more pleasant balance of affect, at least up until their mid-70s". Positive affect might rise during middle age but towards the later years of life{{spaced ndash}}the 70s{{spaced ndash}}it begins to decline while negative affect also does the same. This might be due to failing health, reaching the end of their lives and the death of friends and relatives.&lt;ref name="Labouvie"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Labouvie-Vief|first=Gisela|title=Dynamic Integration:Affect, Cognition and the Self in Adulthood|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|date=December 2003|volume=12|issue=6|pages=201–206|doi=10.1046/j.0963-7214.2003.01262.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to [[Reference range|baseline]] levels of positive and negative affect, studies have found individual differences in the time-course of emotional responses to [[stimulus (psychology)|stimuli]]. The [[Time|temporal]] dynamics of emotional regulation, also known as affective [[chronometry]], include two key variables in the emotional response process: rise time to peak emotional response, and recovery time to baseline levels of emotion.&lt;ref name="Davidson, R. J. 1998 pp. 307-330"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Davidson, R. J. |title= Affective Style and Affective Disorders: Perspectives from Affective Neuroscience|journal= Cognition and Emotion|volume= 12|year=1998|pages=307–330|doi=10.1080/026999398379628|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of affective chronometry typically separate positive and negative affect into distinct categories, as previous research has shown (despite some correlation) the ability of humans to experience changes in these categories independently of one another.&lt;ref&gt;Ruef, Anna Marie; Levenson, Robert W. Coan, James A. (Ed); Allen, John J. B. (Ed) "Continuous measurement of emotion: The affect rating dial" (2007). Handbook of emotion elicitation and assessment. Series in affective science., New York, NY, US: Oxford University Press, pp. 287–297.&lt;/ref&gt; Affective chronometry research has been conducted on clinical populations with [[anxiety]], [[Mood (psychology)|mood]], and [[personality disorders]], but is also utilized as a measurement to test the effectiveness of different therapeutic techniques (including [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] training) on [[emotional dysregulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geschwind N.|pmid=21767001|year=2011|last2=Peeters|first2=F|last3=Drukker|first3=M|last4=Van Os|first4=J|last5=Wichers|first5=M|title=Mindfulness training increases momentary positive emotions and reward experience in adults vulnerable to depression: A randomized controlled trial|volume=79|issue=5|pages=618–28|doi=10.1037/a0024595|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Neurological====
The development of functional [[magnetic resonance imaging|magnetic resonance]] imaging has allowed for the study of emotion regulation on a biological level. Specifically, research over the last decade strongly suggests that there is a neural basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frank | first1 = DW | last2 = Dewitt | first2 = M | last3 = Hudgens-Haney | first3 = ME | last4 = Schaeffer | first4 = DJ | last5 = Ball | first5 = BH | last6 = Schwarz | first6 = NF | last7 = Hussein | first7 = AA | last8 = Smart | first8 = LM | last9 = Sabatinelli | first9 = D | year = 2014 | title = Emotion regulation: Quantitative meta-analysis of functional activation and deactivation | url = | journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 202–211 | doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sufficient evidence has correlated emotion regulation to particular patterns of prefrontal activation. These regions include the [[orbit (anatomy)|orbit]]al prefrontal cortex, the ventromedial [[prefrontal cortex]], and the [[dorsolateral]] prefrontal cortex. Two additional brain structures that have been found to contribute are the amygdala and the anterior cingulate cortex. Each of these structures are involved in various facets of emotion regulation and irregularities in one or more regions and/or interconnections among them are affiliated with failures of emotion regulation. An implication to these findings is that individual differences in prefrontal activation predict the ability to perform various tasks in aspects of emotion regulation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Putnam | first2 = K.M. | last3 = Larson | first3 = C.L. | year = 2000 | title = Dysfunction in the neural circuitry of emotion regulation: A possible prelude to violence | url = | journal = Science | volume = 289 | issue = | pages = 591–594 | doi=10.1126/science.289.5479.591}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sociological===
People intuitively mimic [[facial expressions]]; it is a fundamental part of healthy functioning. Similarities across cultures in regards to [[nonverbal communication]] has prompted the debate that it is in fact a [[universal language]].&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Elfenbein | first1 = H. A. | last2 = Ambady | first2 = N. | year = 2002 | title = On the universality and cultural specificity of emotion recognition: a meta-analysis | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 128 | issue = 2| pages = 203–235 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.128.2.203 | pmid=11931516}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be argued that emotional regulation plays a key role in the ability to emit the correct responses in social situations. Humans have control over facial expressions both [[conscious mind|consciously]] and [[unconscious mind|unconsciously]]: an intrinsic emotion program is generated as the result of a transaction with the world, which immediately results in an emotional response and usually a facial reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ekman | first1 = P. | last2 = Friesen | first2 = W. V. | last3 = Ancoli | first3 = S. | year = 1980 | title = Facial signs of emotional experience | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 39 | issue = | pages = 1125–1134 | doi=10.1037/h0077722}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a well documented [[phenomenon]] that emotions have an effect on facial expression, but recent research has provided evidence that the opposite may also be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Izard | first1 = C. E. | year = 1990 | title = Facial expressions and the regulation of emotions | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 58 | issue = 3| pages = 487–498 | pmid = 2182826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.58.3.487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This notion would give rise to the belief that a person may not only control his emotion but in fact influence them as well. Emotional regulation focuses on providing the appropriate emotion in the appropriate circumstances. Some theories allude to the thought that each emotion serves a specific purpose in coordinating [[organism]]ic needs with [[Environmental psychology|environmental]] demands (cole 1994). This skill, although apparent throughout all nationalities,&lt;ref name="Elfenbein, H. A. 2002"/&gt; has been shown to vary in successful application at different age groups. In experiments done comparing younger and older adults to the same unpleasant stimuli, older adults were able to regulate their emotional reactions in a way that seemed to avoid negative confrontation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charles | first1 = S. T. | last2 = Carstensen | first2 = L. L. | year = 2008 | title = Unpleasant situations elicit different emotional responses in younger and older adults | url = | journal = Psychology and Aging | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 495–504 | doi = 10.1037/a0013284 | pmc = 2677442 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings support the theory that with time people develop a better ability to regulate their emotions. This ability found in adults seems to better allow individuals to react in what would be considered a more appropriate manner in some social situations, permitting them to avoid adverse situations that could be seen as detrimental.

====Expressive regulation (in solitary conditions)====
In solitary conditions, emotional regulation can include a minimization-miniaturization effect, in which common outward expressive patterns are replaced with toned down versions of expression. Unlike other situations, in which physical expression (and its regulation) serve a social purpose (i.e. conforming to [[display rules]] or revealing emotion to outsiders), solitary conditions require no reason for emotions to be outwardly expressed (although intense levels of emotion can bring out noticeable expression anyway). The idea behind this is that as people get older, they learn that the purpose of outward expression (to appeal to other people), is not necessary in situations in which there is no one to appeal to.&lt;ref name="Holodynski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Holodynski|first=Manfred|title=The Miniaturization of Expression in the Development of Emotional Self-Regulation|journal=Developmental Psychology|year=2004|volume=40|issue=1|pages=16–28|doi=10.1037/0012-1649.40.1.16|pmid=14700461}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the level of emotional expression can be lower in these solitary situations.

===Stress===
According to Yu. V. Scherbatykh, emotional stress in situations like school examinations can be reduced by engaging in self-regulating activities prior to the task being performed. To study the influence of [[Self-control|self-regulation]] on mental and [[physiological]] processes under exam stress, Shcerbatykh conducted a test with an experimental group of 28 students (of both sexes) and a control group of 102 students (also of both sexes).&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shcherbatykh|first=Yu. V.|title=Self-Regulation of Autonomic Homeostasis in Emotional Stress|journal=Human Physiology|year=2000|volume=26|issue=5|pages=641–642|url=http://www.no-stress.ru/stress/stress_science/emotional_stress_regulation.html|doi=10.1007/BF02760382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the moments before the examination, [[situational]] stress levels were raised in both groups from what they were in quiet states. In the experimental group, participants engaged in three self-regulating techniques (concentration on respiration, general body relaxation, and the creation of a mental image of successfully passing the examination). During the examination, the anxiety levels of the experimental group were lower than that of the control group. Also, the percent of unsatisfactory marks in the experimental group was 1.7 times less than in the control group. From this data, Scherbatykh concluded that the application of self-regulating actions before examinations helps to significantly reduce levels of emotional strain, which can help lead to better performance results.&lt;ref name=Scherbatykh /&gt;

===Decision making===
Identification of our emotional self-regulating process can facilitate in the decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Miclea, M. |author2=Miu, A. |pmid=20364902|title=Emotion Regulation and Decision Making Under Risk and Uncertainty|year=2010|volume=10|issue=2|pages=257–65|doi=10.1037/a0018489|journal=Emotion (Washington, D.C.)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current literature on emotion regulation identifies that humans characteristically make efforts in controlling emotion experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gross, J. J.|pmid=12212647|url=http://sprweb.org/articles/Gross02.pdf|year=2002|title=Emotion regulation: Affective, cognitive, and social consequences|volume=39|issue=3|pages=281–91|journal=Psychophysiology|doi=10.1017/s0048577201393198}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is then a possibility that our present state emotions can be altered by emotional regulation strategies resulting in the possibility that different regulation strategies could have different decision implications.

==Effects of low self regulation==
With a failure in emotional regulation there is a rise in [[psychosocial]] and emotional dysfunctions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bandura, A. |author2=Caprara, G. V. |author3=Barbaranelli, C. |author4=Gerbino, M. |author5=Pastorelli, C. |title=Role of Affective Self-Regulatory Efficacy in Diverse Spheres of Psychosocial Functioning|pmid=12795389 |jstor=3696228|year=2003|volume=74|issue=3|pages=769–82|journal=Child Development|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00567}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by traumatic experiences due to an inability to regulate emotions. These traumatic experiences typically happen in grade school and are sometimes associated with [[bullying]]. Children who can't properly self-regulate express their volatile emotions in a variety of ways, including screaming if they don't have their way, lashing out with their fists, or bullying other children. Such behaviors often elicit negative reactions from the social environment, which, in turn, can exacerbate or maintain the original regulation problems over time, a process termed cumulative continuity. These children are more likely to have conflict-based relationships with their teachers and other children. This can lead to more severe problems such as an impaired ability to adjust to school and predicts school dropout many years later. Children who fail to properly self-regulate grow as teenagers with more emerging problems. Their peers begin to notice this "immaturity", and these children are often excluded from social groups and teased and harassed by their peers. This "immaturity" certainly causes some teenagers to become social outcasts in their respective social groups, causing them to lash out in angry and potentially violent ways. Being teased or being an outcast during the teenage years is especially damaging and could lead to a dysfunctional future,{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} which is why it is recommended to foster emotional self-regulation in children as early as possible.

'''Factor Ten''' is a social and economic policy program developed by the Factor Ten institute with the stated goal of reducing human resource turnover by 90% on a global scale within the next 30 to 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factor10-institute.org/ |title=Factor 10 Institute |publisher=Factor 10 Institute |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek, from the [[Wuppertal Institute for Climate, Environment and Energy]], first proposed the Factor 10 and [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]] concepts in the early 1990s. He concluded in his studies that 80% of the world’s resources are distributed among [[First World]] nations, which contribute 20% of the global population, so those nations are promoting an unsustainable system of development. The goal of Factor 10 is to assure that nations do not exceed the planet’s [[carrying capacity]] but leave sufficient resources for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/factor-10 |title=Factor 10 : Dictionary of Sustainable Management |publisher=Sustainabilitydictionary.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Factor 4 ==
Factor 10 evolved from the less dramatic '''Factor 4''' was originally proposed by [[L. Hunter Lovins]] and [[Amory Lovins]] of the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]] and [[Ernst Ulrich von Weizsäcker|Ernst von Weizsäcker]], the founder of the [[Wuppertal Institute]] for Climate, Environment &amp; Energy. Their book ''Factor 4'' explains how simple it is for nations to achieve Factor 4 results with existing technologies. The concept attempts to reduce resource and energy use by 75 % by doubling output and halving input of production.

== Goals ==
Factor 10 requires the creation of new technologies, policies, and manufacturing processes along with sociocultural change to create a [[global economy]] that is sustainable for a long period of time. The long-term goal of Factor 10, many governments and firms aspiring toward shortIterm relief have difficulty achieving the massive reductions proposed by factor 10. [[Eco-efficiency]], environmental purchasing design for environment, policies and [[environmental taxes]] have already been used by business and governments implementing the Factor 10 theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdrc.org/sustdev/concepts/11-f10.html |title=Sustainability Concepts: Factor 10 |publisher=Gdrc.org |date= |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factor 10 goes farther as a response to the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] call for a tenfold reduction in resource consumption in industrialised countries as a necessary long-term target if adequate resources are to be released for the needs of the [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[[UNEP]], Global Environmental Outlook 2000, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; With the predicted rise in population and economic growth to maintain the level of [[pollution]] we have today, we need to be able to produce the same output for 10% of the impact.

Factor X concept is the direct way of using metric and various activities that can reduce the throughput of resources and energy in the given process. The essential question is by what factor can or should certain flows be reduced. It is a useful tool to monitor the performance of business in terms of [[dematerialization (economics)|dematerialization]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert, K.H., Schmidt-Bleek, B., et al. (2002). "Strategic sustainable development, selection, design and synergies of applied tools." ''[[Journal of Cleaner Production]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenprinting can galvanize public support and encourage partners to work toward common conservation goals. Greenprinting often involves use of state-of-the-art maps and models created with [[Geographic Information System]] ([[GIS]]) software that combines layers of spatial and [[demographic]] information to guide [[growth management]] efforts.

'''Gregory Buchakjian''' (born 1971, in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]]) is a Lebanese photographer, filmmaker and art historian. He studied at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University]]. He teaches at [[Lebanese Academy of Fine Arts|Académie Libanaise des Beaux-Arts ALBA]] and was co founder, with architects Pierre Hage Boutros and Rana Haddad, of [[Atelier de Recherche ALBA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centreimage.ch/cic_archives/02progF/expos/2004/formidable_beyrouth_f.html |title=Formidable Beyrouth ! |author= |year=2004 |work= |publisher=[[Centre pour l’image contemporaine]] - [[Saint-Gervais (Geneva)]] |accessdate=22 January 2012}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Gregory Buchakjian is member of the advisory committee of the Saradar Collection, devoted to Lebanese art from the contemporary and modern periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saradar.com/English/SaradarCollection |title=Saradar Collection - Saradar Group |author= |year=2015 |work= |publisher=Saradar |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Gregory Buchakjian emerged in the art scene after the [[2006 Lebanon War]] within a collective of Lebanese filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Arab Filmmakers of the Middle East. A Dictionary

&lt;/ref&gt; presented part of the ''Videos Under Siege'' project featured in the [[Dubai International Film Festival]] 2008.

In the following years, he slipped into Beirut’s vibrant and underground nightlife. His photographs depict sensuality although violence and anxiety remain hidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://lalettredelaphotographie.com/entries/4159/|title= Gregory Buchakjian  Nighthawks |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher= La Lettre de la Photographie |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking its name "Nighthawks" from [[Nighthawks|a famous painting]] by [[Edward Hopper]], the project was exhibited in [[Der Aa-kerk]], [[Groningen]] as part of the 18th [[Noorderlicht]] Photofestival 2011: Metropolis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.photography-now.com/artists/K42889.html |title= Gregory Buchakjian  - Exhibitions |author= |year=2011 |work= |publisher= Photography Now: The international online platform for Photography and Video Art |accessdate=15 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2009 to 2016, Gregory Buchakjian constituted a long term projet devoted to abandoned dwellings in Beirut, that developed as  photographic interpretation of the derelict interiors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blouinartinfo.com/news/story/1044051/video-art-in-beirut-photographer-gregory-buchakjian-abandoned# |title= VIDEO: Art in Beirut—Photographer Gregory Buchakjian, Abandoned Sensuality |author=Eric Gonon |date=8 July 2014 |work= |publisher= Blouin ArtInfo |accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew into an extensive research and a PhD dissertation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.paris-sorbonne.fr/M-GREGORY-BUCHAKJIAN-Habitats |title= M.

In 2018, Gregory Buchakjian was selected to be part of &lt;I&gt;The Place that remains&lt;/I&gt;, the first national Pavilion of Lebanon curated by [[Hala Younes]] at the [[Venice Biennale of Architecture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://lebanesepavilionvenice2018.com/documents |title=The Place that remains  |author= |date=2018 |work= |publisher=Lebanese Pavilion, Venice Biennale 2018 |accessdate=26 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hampshire College''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] in [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], [[Massachusetts]]. It was opened in 1970 as an experiment in alternative education, in association with four other colleges in the [[Pioneer Valley]]: [[Amherst College]], [[Smith College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. Together they have since been known as the [[Five Colleges (Massachusetts)|Five Colleges]] or the [[Five College Consortium]].

The college is widely known for its alternative curriculum, socially liberal politics, focus on portfolios rather than [[distribution requirements]], and its reliance on [[narrative evaluations]] instead of grades and [[GPA]]s. In some fields, it is among the top undergraduate institutions in percentage of graduates who enroll in graduate school. Sixty-five percent of its alumni have at least one graduate degree and a quarter have founded their own business or organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Success After Hampshire|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/admissions/student-outcomes|website=Hampshire College}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is ranked #39 among U.S. [[colleges]] and [[universities]] by the percentage of graduates who go on to earn a [[doctorate degree]] according to [[National Science Foundation]] data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2018/01/23/hampshire-a-top-40-college-for-alums-earning-a-doctorate-federal-data-reveals |title=Hampshire a Top-40 College for Alums Earning a Doctorate, Federal Data Reveals |publisher=Hampshire College }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:Hampshire College viewed from Bare Mountain, October 2017.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|Hampshire College viewed from Bare Mountain October 2017. Amherst College (top right) and The University of Massachusetts Amherst (top left) are both visible.]]

The idea for Hampshire College originated in 1958 when the presidents of Amherst, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges, and the University of Massachusetts Amherst, appointed a committee to examine the assumptions and practices of liberal arts education. Their report, "The New College Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/sites/default/files/archives/files/NewColl.pdf |title=Data |website=www.hampshire.edu |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; ", advocated many of the features that have since been realized in the Hampshire curriculum: inviting students to self-design their program of studies; training students to be able to educate themselves through their lifetimes; emphasis on each student's curiosity and motivation; learning among and across multiple disciplines; and close mentoring relationships with teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New College Plan, 1958|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/library/chapter-1-precursors#11B|website=Hampshire College Archives|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Amherst College alumnus Harold F. Johnson, inspired by the New College Plan, donated $6 million toward the founding of Hampshire College. With a matching grant from the Ford Foundation, Hampshire's first trustees purchased {{convert|800|acre|km2}} of orchard and farmland in South Amherst, Massachusetts, and construction began.

One of the most significant founding documents of Hampshire College is the book ''The Making of a College'' (MIT Press, 1967; {{ISBN|0-262-66005-9}}), co-written by the College's first president, Franklin Patterson, together with Hampshire's founding employee from Amherst College who would become its second president, Chuck Longsworth.  ''The Making of a College'' is (as of 2003) out of print but available in electronic form from the Hampshire College Archives.&lt;ref name="Making of a College"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.hampshire.edu/archives/3881.htm |title=Making of a College |edition=1975 |accessdate=January 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hampshire admitted its first students in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Acquiring Land for the New College {{!}} www.hampshire.edu|url = https://www.hampshire.edu/library/acquiring-land-for-the-new-college|website = www.hampshire.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For several years immediately after its founding in the early 1970s, the large number of applications for matriculation caused Hampshire College to be among the most selective undergraduate programs in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Making of a College'' pp. 307–310.&lt;/ref&gt; Its admissions selectivity declined thereafter because of declining application popularity. The school's number of applications increased again in the late 1990s, causing increased admissions selectivity since then. The college's rate of admissions is now comparable to that of many other small liberal arts colleges.

The school has been financially challenged through much of its history, in large part because it lacked a founding endowment to rely on for stability of income, and it has relied substantially on tuition income for operations. As of June 30, 2017, the endowment had risen to $48.5 million.&lt;ref name="Hampshire College"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.hampshire.edu/sites/default/files/businessoffice/files/031918financials1617FNL.pdf | title = Hampshire College Financial Report 2016-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the school has been on more solid financial footing, though still lacking a sizable endowment. In recent years its financial stability has relied on fundraising efforts led by its most recent president, [[Jonathan Lash]].

In the mid-1990s, the college began establishing a "cultural village" making possible the residence of independent non-profit organizations on its campus. The cultural village&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Welcomes Hitchcock Center to its Cultural Village|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2016/10/01/hampshire-college-welcomes-hitchcock-center-for-the-environment-to-its-cultural|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes the [[National Yiddish Book Center]], the [[Eric Carle Museum of Picture Book Art]] and The Hitchcock Center for the Environment.

[[File:Hampshire College logo.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|'''The 'H' logo''' of Hampshire College, used separately from the seal. The four colored bars represent the other four colleges that formed Hampshire.]]

[[Adele Simmons]] served as the College's third president, from 1977 to 1989, the longest tenure of any Hampshire President. Gregory Prince served as its fourth president, from 1989 to 2005.

On April 1, 2004, Prince announced his retirement, effective at the end of the 2004–2005 academic year. On April 5, 2005, the Board of Trustees named [[Ralph Hexter]], formerly a dean at [[University of California, Berkeley]]'s College of Letters and Science, as the college's next president, effective August 1, 2005.  Hexter was inaugurated on October 15, 2005. The appointment made Hampshire one of a small number of colleges and universities in the United States with an openly [[gay]] president.&lt;ref&gt;The exact number was unclear, but there may have been as few as eight openly gay college and university presidents {{As of|2007|lc=on}}, and at the time Hexter was named president of Hampshire there were fewer still.

''Chronicle of Higher Education'' News Blog, August 7, 2007. See also Hexter, Ralph J. "[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2007/01/25/hexter Being an 'Out' President]." ''Inside Higher Ed'' January 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Marlene Gerber Fried was interim president for one year from 2010 to 2011. [[Jonathan Lash]] was named the sixth president of the College in May, 2011, joining Hampshire as an internationally recognized expert on global sustainability, climate change, and environmental challenges and solutions. He has been appointed by two US Presidents to serve on a national environmental council and commission. Lash served a long tenure until 2018, and is followed by the College's seventh president, [[Miriam Nelson]], beginning her appointment in July, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miriam Nelson, Prominent U.S. Health Scholar, Educator, and Policy Adviser, Named President of Hampshire|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2018/04/17/miriam-nelson-prominent-us-health-scholar-educator-and-policy-adviser-named|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hampshire College Archives in the Harold F. Johnson Library has extensively documented the College's history between 1965 and 2005, accessible on the College's Website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Documentary Histories|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/library/the-documentary-histories-of-hampshire-college|website=Hampshire College Archives|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 23, 2012, the school announced the establishment of a scholarship fund dedicated to helping undocumented students get degrees. It would give more than $25,000 each year to help an undocumented student pay for the $43,000-plus tuition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Shannon|title=MASS.

==18th Century Proposal for a College in Hampshire County (unrelated)==

Around 1761, an idea for a new college with a different system was debated among settlers and the Massachusetts government.  They proposed calling the new institution Hampshire college which, if successful, would have been completely different from Hampshire College today.   A group of 74 people in [[Hampshire County, Massachusetts|Hampshire County]] expressed interest in establishing a new college to train their ministers and civil leaders since the other colleges were expensive and far away.  Furthermore, they wanted to establish a system that followed their moral standards and was free of religion.  Their proposal was denied by the Massachusetts government in attempt to avoid a competition with Harvard College.  At the time, Harvard College was recognized by the state as the most suitable college for training ministers; it was feared a new college would weaken Harvard.  The group then sought assistance from [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Lord Jeffry Amherst]] who also declined support as to not question the Massachusetts government.&lt;ref name="The Proposed College in Hampshire County in 1762,"&gt;{{citation|title=The Proposed College in Hampshire County in 1762|url=https://dspace.hampshire.edu/bitstream/10009/560/2/APRE.pdf|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics and resources==

=== Curriculum ===
Hampshire College describes itself as "experimenting" rather than "experimental", to emphasize the changing nature of its curriculum. From its inception, the curriculum has generally had certain non-traditional features:
* An emphasis on ''project work'' as well as, or instead of, courses
* Detailed [[narrative evaluations|''written evaluations'']] (as well as portfolio evaluations) for completed courses and projects, rather than letter or number grades
* A curriculum centered on ''student interests'', with students taking an active role in designing their own concentrations and projects
* An emphasis on independent motivation and student organization, both within and without the college's formal curriculum

[[File:emilydickinsonhall.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Emily Dickinson]] Hall, designed by the architecture firm of former faculty member [[Norton Juster]], houses much of the humanities, creative writing, and theatre]]

The curriculum is divided into three "divisions" rather than four grade-years:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire's Academic Program|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/academics/the-academic-program|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Division I: Exploration and Working Across Disciplines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Division I|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/academics/division-i|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Division I, the student, mentored by a professor as adviser:
a) Completes a minimum of four courses from five broad distribution areas. 
* Arts, Design, and Media
* Culture, Humanities, and Languages (language study strongly encouraged for those planning to study abroad)
* Mind, Brain, and Information
* Physical and Biological Sciences 
* Power, Community, and Social Justice
b) Completes three elective courses from Hampshire or the Five Colleges. Independent study and special projects are allowed with adviser approval. 
c) Completes a community-engaged learning activity, devoting 40 hours to campus life
d) Submits a year-end portfolio of work and faculty evaluations from courses and electives, including an essay reflecting on Division I, and receives a final written evaluation from the adviser.

*Division II: Concentration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Division II|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/academics/division-ii|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (typically years 2 and 3)
Drawing on resources at Hampshire and the Five Colleges and advised by a committee of two faculty members, the student: 
a) Designs a concentration, starting by writing a plan for four semesters of work that sets out their questions for exploration and goals for developing expertise in the concentration. The plan may be similar to a traditional college major or an original, individualized program encompassing multiple fields, disciplines, and Schools. The plan is considered a contract negotiated with the committee, and may be revised periodically. It may include courses and other activities — independent study/research, community-based learning, internships, study abroad, social action, lab work, teaching/research assistantships, etc. The minimum number of evaluated activities is 12.
b) Fulfills a Multiple Cultural Perspectives requirement by completing a course/learning activity centered on an exploration of non-Western perspectives, the roles of race and racism in the U.S., or the dynamics of knowledge, power, and privilege. 
c) Fulfills a community-engaged learning requirement by devoting at least 40 hours to addressing a community need by volunteering with a community partner; serving an internship, assistantship, or mentorship; completing a course with a community component.

To complete Division II, the student compiles and presents a portfolio to the committee, curating the academic work and reflecting on its meaning and on learning. The portfolio consists of selected works (in any medium), evaluations from courses/learning activities, and a Division II reflection, demonstrating that the student has fulfilled the contract. The student receives a final committee evaluation.

*Division III: Creating Knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Division III|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/academics/division-iii|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The student forms a committee of at least two faculty members and designs an original, yearlong advanced-study project, one that will demonstrate the student’s ability to handle complex questions, concepts, and skills. The student submits the plan as a contract including a description of the purpose and substantive nature of the project; the approach and techniques to be applied; resources and facilities to be employed; and the form the final project will take. The student meets with the committee regularly to report on progress. Faculty will provide reviews, critiques, and guidance throughout and must find the work sufficient to graduate with a bachelor of arts degree.

To successfully complete Division III, the student must: 
a) Complete the Division III project
b) Complete at least two advanced learning activities (e.g. courses at the 300 level or above, a teaching assistantship, an internship, or another activity that broadens the scope of the student’s intellectual endeavor and engages the campus or community at large.

The student submits the final capstone project, performance, presentation, or paper, and meets for the last time with the committee. Committee members write an evaluation of the Division III.

In 2014 Hampshire announced the formation of a new concentration, in Psychoanalytic Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2014/02/21/feb-27-announcement-of-the-new-concentration-in-psychoanalytic-studies-at-hampshire|title=Announcement of the new concentration|accessdate=May 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Five College Consortium===

Hampshire College is the youngest of the schools in the Five-College Consortium. The other schools are [[Amherst College]], [[Mt. Holyoke College]], [[Smith College]] and the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivecolleges.edu/|title=www.fivecolleges.edu|work=fivecolleges.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students at each of the schools may take classes and borrow books at the other schools, generally without paying additional fees. They may use resources at the other schools, including internet access, dining halls, and so forth. The five colleges collectively offer over 5,300 courses, and the five libraries have over eight million books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fivecolleges.edu/libraries/|title=Libraries - www.fivecolleges.edu|work=fivecolleges.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pioneer Valley Transit Authority (PVTA) operates bus services between the schools and the greater [[Pioneer Valley]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pvta.com/|title=Pioneer Valley Transit Authority of Western Massachusetts|work=pvta.com|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two joint departments in the five-college consortium: Dance and Astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five College Academic Opportunities|url=https://www.fivecolleges.edu/academics/departments_programs|website=https://www.fivecolleges.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==

===The R.W. Kern Center===
Opened on April 26, 2017, the R.W. Kern Center is the 17th Living Building in the world certified under the advanced green-building standard, the [[Living Building Challenge]].  The building cost $10.4 million made possible by private donations.  It operates net-zero energy, water, and waste. The building is powered by solar panels on its roof, supplies its own drinking water by harvesting rainwater from its roof, manages its wastewater on site, and contains composting toilets.  The Kern Center was built using materials from local sources without the use of any toxic "red list" materials; even materials such as duct tape were chosen carefully to comply with strict environmental standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire College Earns Living Building Certification for R.W. Kern Center|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2018/04/10/hampshire-college-earns-living-building-certification-for-rw-kern-center|website=Hampshire College|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, the Kern Center houses Admissions and financial aid offices as well as classrooms, student lounges, and a coffee shop. President Jonathan Lash stated that "[w]ith this building we have sought to reflect our values, in the inclusive design process, the design and materials, our construction practices, and our reporting about the building... [w]hy are buildings constructed any other way? In every way, the Kern Center was built to learn and teach.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2016/02/29/hampshire-announces-ribbon-cutting-opening-ceremony-for-kern-center|title=Hampshire Announces Ribbon-Cutting Opening Ceremony for Kern Center|work=hampshirecollege.edu|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/02/20/hampshire-college-sustainability-efforts-reach-new-level/GZNOj27sHcdGxhWAia9fCJ/story.html|title=At Hampshire College, sustainability efforts reach new level|work=bostonglobe.com|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate Action Plan ===

[[File:Hampshire College's solar panel field October 2017.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|The solar panel field at Hampshire College]]
Hampshire College will soon become the first college in the United States to be 100% solar powered, a milestone for the college.  They wait for permission to switch to full operation of its solar energy.  The solar panel array is a part of the college's main goal - to be climate-neutral by 2020 according to their extensive Climate Action Plan developed in April 2012.  They begain construction in February 2015. Two witness tests were conducted in June 2017 and its final one conducted November 2017.  Since June 2017, a part of the solar array has been powering the college.  The solar panels cover 19 acres consisting of 15,000 panels which will eventually produce 4.7 megawatts of power each year.  Hampshire College contracted with SolarCity to install the panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=
https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2017/12/01/hampshire-conducts-final-test-for-100-solar-campus|title=Hampshire Conducts Final Test for 100% Solar Campus|work=hampshirecollege.edu|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The college will save up to $8 million in electricity cost in 20 years and $400,000 yearly.  4.7 megawatts of solar power eliminates 3,000 metric tons of greenhouse-gas emissions per year which is equivalent to 650 less cars on the road.  Other solar sources on campus contribute to the main solar array: the Kern Center rooftop solar arrays, the CSA Barn, the president's house, and the Longworth Arts Center canopy atop solar panels. The president stated that "[t]his is the challenge that our students and every other student is going to face in the next 20 years, how to turn the US economy into a low-carbon economy ... and they're going to get the real firsthand experience of doing it. So that was reason number one.” The president has declared that switching to renewable energy is "just the right thing to do in an era of accelerating climate change."  He also noted this project will keep jobs local and prevent "pipelines being built through people's communities to get power to our college."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

In the next 20 years, the college plans to reduce 50% of current consumption of energy, another major goal stated in their Climate Action Plan.  They plan to renovate the Robert Crown Center, Library, Cole Science Center, Franklin Patterson Hall, Merrill House, and Greenwich House.  Their plan is possible by a $1 million gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=

===Timeline of Sustainability Initiative===

[[File:MapleSugarShack.jpg|thumb|The Maple Sugar Shack]]
Since 2011, Hampshire College has been involved in various projects to "transform its food systems, campus operations, curriculum and campus culture to embrace sustainability." The college's advances in sustainability include various projects.  In 2011, the college was the first in the world to divest from fossil-fuels.  In 2012, they developed the Climate Action Plan for climate neutrality by 2022.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/sustainable/climate-action-plan|title=Climate Action Plan|last=|first=|date=|website=hampshirecollege.edu|access-date=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hampshire College Farm expanded their education and operation, establishing the Center for New England and Agriculture. In 2014 the main traffic circle and parking lot was eliminated and turned into a meadow.  They also stopped mowing dozen acres of lawns in hopes of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, saving landscaping expenses and creating wildlife and plant habitats.  In the same year, they installed an electric car-charging station behind the library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2014/03/26/charging-station-for-electric-vehicles-at-hampshire-college|title=Charging Station for Electric Vehicles at Hampshire College|work=hampshirecollege.edu|accessdate=December 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015 they permanently protected 46 acres of their property through a conservation restriction. The Kern Center became their first 100% emission-free building in 2016 and the Hitchcock Center for the Environment built its new living building on Hampshire land.

==Prominent campus issues==

===Re-Radicalization===
In the spring of 2004, a student group calling itself ''Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College (Re-Rad)'' emerged with a [[manifesto]] called ''The Re-Making of a College'', which critiqued what they saw as a betrayal of Hampshire's founding ideas in alternative education and student-centered learning.  On May 3, 2004, the group staged a demonstration that packed the hall outside the President's office during an administrative meeting.  Response from the community was generally amicable and Re-Rad made some progress.

[[File:Hampshire College Yurt.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[Yurt]] is home to Hampshire's student radio station]]

The Re-Radicalization movement was responding in part to a new "First-Year Plan" that changed the structure of the first year of study.  Beginning in the Fall of 2002, the requirements for passing Division I were changed so that first-year students no longer had to complete independent projects (see Curriculum above). Re-Rad submitted its own counter-proposal in both 2006 and 2007, but these proposals were not acted on, and no follow-up was attempted.

The Re-Radicalization of Hampshire College assisted the administration in launching a pilot program known as ''mentored independent study''. This program paired ten third semester students with Division III students with similar academic interests to complete a small study—observed by, and subject to the approval of, a faculty member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Re-Rad - Hampedia|url = https://hampedia.org/wiki/Re-rad#History_of_the_Movement|website = hampedia.org|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some students worry about what they see as Hampshire's headlong plunge into normality, the circumstances of Hampshire's founding tends to perennially attract students who revive the questions about education the institution was founded on, and who challenge the administration to honor the founding mission. Unsurprisingly, then, Re-Rad was not the first student push of its type. Similar efforts have sprung up at Hampshire with some regularity, with varying impacts. In 1996, student Chris Kawecki spearheaded a similar push called the Radical Departure, calling for a more holistic, organic integration of education into students' lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://peterchristopher.com/peterchristopher/ed/xp/ The Experimental Program In Education and Community Peter Christopher Document Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715065503/http://peterchristopher.com/peterchristopher/ed/xp/ |date=July 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most durable legacy of the Radical Departure was EPEC, a series of student-led non-credit courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hampshire.edu/studentlife/5897.htm|title=Experimental Program in Education and Community (EPEC)|work=hampshire.edu|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more detailed account of movements such as these can be found in a history of Hampshire student activities, an account written by alumnus Timothy Shary (F86) that was commissioned by Community Council in 1990; he has subsequently been a faculty member at [[Clark University]] of [[Worcester, Massachusetts]],  and the [[University of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ou.edu/fvs/faculty/shary.htm Timothy Shary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223025519/http://www.ou.edu/fvs/faculty/shary.htm |date=February 23, 2009 }}, University of Oklahoma, Faculty of Film &amp; Video Studies Faculty. &lt;br&gt; [http://www.ou.edu/fvs/faculty/Shary%20CV%2010%2022%2007.doc Timothy Shary, Curriculum Vitae] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223074102/http://www.ou.edu/fvs/faculty/Shary%20CV%2010%2022%2007.doc |date=February 23, 2009 }} (MS Word)&lt;br&gt; Note in the CV: Keynote Speech: ''Activating the History in Student Activities,'' delivered at Hampshire College History Day, Amherst, MA, April 29, 2000.

In May 1977, Hampshire was the first college in the nation to divest from [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hampshire.edu/archives/3406.htm Volume 2, 1975–1985, Chapter 6: Divestment] Hampshire College Archives&lt;/ref&gt; The college removed $39,000 in stocks in four companies.  Legal and financial research undertaken by student Michael Current and faculty member Kurtis Gordon was promoted nationally by business activists Douglas Tooley and Debbie Knight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu/content/hampshire-college-students-campaign-divestment-south-africa-us-1977|title=Hampshire College students win divestment from apartheid South Africa, U.S., 1977 {{!}} Global Nonviolent Action Database|website=nvdatabase.swarthmore.edu|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2009 it was reported that Hampshire College had divested from Israel because of its violation of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/02/12/hampshire-college-divests_n_166528.html|title=Hampshire College Divests From Israel|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, under pressure from pro-Israel groups and high-profile individuals, most notably attorney [[Alan Dershowitz]], the father of a Hampshire alumnus, Hampshire's president stated that the changes in investments were not politically motivated.  Hampshire continues to display a statement from Dershowitz on its website, in which the lawyer withdraws his criticism and pledges his support, stating, "Hampshire has now done the right thing. It has made it unequivocally clear that it did not and will not divest from Israel. Indeed, it will continue to hold stock in companies that do business with Israel as well as with Israeli companies...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=College|first1=Hampshire|title=Public Statement by Alan Dershowitz|url=https://www.hampshire.edu/news/2009/02/24/public-statement-by-alan-dershowitz|website=hampshire.edu|accessdate=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2001, a controversial All-Community Vote at Hampshire declared the school opposed to the recently launched [[War on Terrorism]], another national first that drew national media attention, including scathing reports from [[Fox News Channel]] and the ''[[New York Post]]'' ("Kooky College Condemns War"). ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' had a regular sketch, "[[Saturday Night Live TV show sketches of the 2000s#Jarret's Room|Jarret's Room]]", starring [[Jimmy Fallon]], which purports to take place at Hampshire College but is inaccurate. It refers to non-existent buildings ("McGuinn Hall", which is actually the Sociology and Social Work building at fellow cast member [[Amy Poehler]]'s alma mater, [[Boston College]]) and features yearbooks, tests, seniors, fraternities, three-person dorm rooms, and a football team—none of which the school has ever had (though in the Fall 2005, 2006, and 2007 semesters the college experienced a higher than expected number of freshmen and temporarily had to convert some common spaces into three-person dorms). The sketch also claims that the college is actually in [[New Hampshire]] (a common mistake).

Alumnus [[Ken Burns]] wrote of the college: "Hampshire College is a perfect American place. If we look back at the history of our country, the things we celebrate were outside of the mainstream. Much of the world operated under a tyrannical model, but Americans said, 'We will govern ourselves.' So, too, Hampshire asked, at its founding, the difficult questions of how we might educate ourselves... When I entered Hampshire, I found it to be the most exciting place on earth." [[Loren Pope]] wrote of Hampshire in the college guide ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]'': "Today no college has students whose intellectual thyroids are more active or whose minds are more compassionately engaged."

===Flag removal===
Following the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election]] of [[Donald Trump]] as [[President of the United States]], on November 9, 2016, Hampshire students lowered the [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] at the center of campus to [[half-staff]] as "a protest against acts of hate and harassment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hoover|first1=Amanda|title=Why Hampshire College pulled down the American Flag|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2016/1128/Why-Hampshire-College-pulled-down-the-American-Flag|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, school officials announced they would allow the flag to remain at half-staff temporarily. College president Jonathan Lash said in a statement that some of the people on campus felt that the flag was "a powerful symbol of fear they've felt all their lives because they grew up in marginalized communities, never feeling safe." In an incident under investigation by campus police, the [[flag desecration|flag was burned]] at some time in the evening of November 10 or the morning of November 11. It was replaced the following day and the school indicated it would continue to fly the flag at half-mast "to mourn deaths from violence in the U.S. and around the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bromwich|first1=Jonah Engel|title=Hampshire College Draws Protests Over Removal of U.S. Flag|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/hampshire-college-flag-veterans-protest.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a backlash, the college announced on November 21 that it would temporarily cease flying the flag on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/11/21/massachusetts-college-stops-flying-american-flag-after-it-becomes-focus-of-dispute-over-trump/|title=Massachusetts college stops flying American flag after it becomes focus of dispute over Trump|work=Washington Post|date=November 21, 2016|first=Susan |last=Svrluga|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/hampshirecollege/posts/10154927092331159|title=A Statement from President Lash: "Some... - Hampshire College {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, led to protests including veterans for restoration of the flag, with sources claiming from 400 attendees to “over a thousand.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwlp.com/2016/11/27/veterans-protest-flag-removal-at-hampshire-college/|title=Veterans protest flag removal at Hampshire College|first=Ashley|last=Afonso|date=November 27, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=November 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/28/us/hampshire-college-flag-veterans-protest.amp.html&lt;/ref&gt; Local state representative [[John Velis]] (D) called for the school to return the flag and expel the students who burned the flag: they should "pack up their bags and leave."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwlp.com/2016/11/14/rep-john-velis-says-flag-burners-should-pack-up-their-bags-and-leave/|title=Rep.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His major works cover [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the [[Psalms]], and his major interests centered on the oral tradition behind written sources and in folklore.

== Biography ==
Gunkel was born in [[Springe]], [[Kingdom of Hanover]],&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; where his father and grandfather were [[Lutheran]] [[pastor]]s.&lt;ref name=briefhistory&gt;{{cite book | last=Gignilliat | first=Mark S. | title=A Brief History of Old Testament Criticism | year=2012 | publisher=Zondervan | location=Grand Rapids, MI | page=108 | chapter=Hermann Gunkel | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WrJln5IwiZ8C&amp;pg=PT108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] and the [[University of Giessen]]. He eventually taught at both universities in addition to those of [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[University of Halle-Wittenberg|Halle]].&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFLGroLOKq8C&amp;pg=PA499#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFLGroLOKq8C | editor-last=McKim | editor-first=Donald K | first=M. J. | last=Buss | chapter=Gunkel, Hermann | title=Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters | year=2007 | publisher=InterVarsity Press | pages=499–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunkel started his career in [[New Testament]] studies at [[Göttingen]] in 1888. However, he was soon transferred to [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] (1889-1894) and told to concentrate on the [[Hebrew Bible]] by the Prussian academic appointments authority. He went on to teach in [[Berlin]] (1894-1907), where he made many inter-disciplinary contacts. His 1895 book, ''Creation and Chaos in the Primeval Era and the Eschaton'', compared the symbolism in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 12. In 1901, he produced the first of three editions of commentary on Genesis, ''Genesis Translated and Explained''.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;

In 1907, Gunkel finally obtained a full professorship at the [[University of Giessen]]. There he produced the third and final edition of ''Genesis'' in 1910 and ''The Prophets'' in 1917. He moved to the [[University of Halle-Wittenberg]] in 1920. He published another standard work, his commentary on the book of [[Psalms]], ''The Psalms: Translated and Explained'' in 1926. ''Introduction to the Psalms'' was his last major project, brought to completion by his student [[Joachim Begrich]] in 1933.&lt;ref name=dictionary /&gt;

Gunkel founded the series ''Research into the Religion and Literature of the Old and New Testaments'' (1903-) with [[Wilhelm Bousset]].&lt;ref name=EB /&gt; He also co-edited with Leopold Zscharnack the second edition of the German religious encyclopedia ''Religion in History and the Present'' (1927-1931), in which he authored over one hundred articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Psalms: A Form-Critical Introduction | url=http://www.ericlevy.com/revel/Psalms/Gunkel%20H%20-%20The%20Psalms%20-%20A%20Form-Critical%20Introduction%20Abridged.PDF | first=James | last=Muilenburg | author-link=James Muilenburg|chapter=Introduction | location=Philadelphia | publisher=Fortress Press | year=1967 | page=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunkel became a leading representative of the "[[history of religions school]]" (''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule''), which addressed the history of traditions behind the biblical text. In addition to Gunkel, the original group also included [[Albert Eichhorn]], [[William Wrede]], Heinrich Hackmann, [[Alfred Rahlfs]], [[Johannes Weiss]], [[Wilhelm Bousset]], [[Ernst Troeltsch]], and [[Wilhelm Heitmüller]].&lt;ref name=ludemann&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  Form criticism examined the genres used in the biblical text to identify the ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'' (setting in life) that produced the text. This approach was based on the assumption that each genre is organically associated with a particular social and historical situation. Nineteenth-century [[source criticism]] had examined the biblical text, especially the [[Pentateuch]], on the basis of style, vocabulary, theology, and other criteria to identify the basic literary sources used to create the text. Form criticism allowed scholars to go behind these larger literary sources by identifying the smaller and older sources used by their authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Form Criticism |url=http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t94/e693 |work=Oxford Biblical Studies Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its utility, form criticism became immensely influential in Germany and Europe during the 20th century, with important scholars like [[Gerhard von Rad]] and [[Martin Noth]] applying and developing it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

'''Hill people''' is a general term for people who live in [[hill]]s and [[mountain]]s. There are a wide variety of hill people around the world, many of whom live by small scale [[pastoralism]] or on small farms. Musical instruments of hill people, such as various forms of [[Blowing horn|horn]], are notable for their ability to be heard at great distances. Political borders often split hill peoples between countries, and they are sometimes minorities in their countries with a tradition of resisting control by central government.

==Africa==

===Drakensberg===
[[File:Utimuni.png|thumb|right|200px|Zulu Warrior [[Utimuni]], nephew of [[Shaka]], the Zulu king.]]
The [[Drakensberg]] are the highest mountain range in [[Southern Africa]], rising up to {{convert|3482|m|ft}} in height. The people of these mountains are mostly [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking people who moved into the area from the north a thousand years ago, displacing the original [[Khoisan]] people. They include the [[Swazi people|Swazi]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu people|Zulu]]. Traditionally these people lived by cattle herding and small-scale farming, growing crops such as sorghum, maize, corn, pumpkins, beans and vegetables.&lt;ref name="Mesthrie, Rajend 1995 49"&gt;{{cite book|title=Language and Social History: Studies in South African Sociolinguistics|author=Mesthrie, Rajend|year=1995|isbn=0-86486-280-6|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time the Europeans reached this part of [[South Africa]] (around 1830), the Zulu were temporarily in the ascendancy after a series of wars between the people of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Morris, Donald R. |title=The Washing of the Spears: The Rise of the Zulu Nation |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=Cambridge |year=1998 |pages=692 Pages |isbn=0-306-80866-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is divided between [[South Africa]], [[Lesotho]] and [[Swaziland]], but the people move relatively freely between these states.&lt;ref name="Mesthrie, Rajend 1995 49"/&gt;

===Ethiopian Highlands===

[[Geography of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] has a high central plateau that varies from {{convert|1,800|to|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, with the highest mountain reaching {{convert|4,533|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Near the equator but high up, the climate is temperate all year round. The heavy rains from June until mid-September feed the [[Blue Nile]], which waters [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rw/rwb.nsf/AllDocsByUNID/eb6711519e43d27e85256c5c006aab4c "Ethiopia: Drought intensifies during corn and sorghum harvest"] ReliefWeb&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's population is highly diverse. Most of its people speak [[Afro-Asiatic languages]] of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] or [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branches. The former includes [[Oromo language|Oromiffa]], spoken by the [[Oromo people]], and [[Somali language|Somali]], spoken by the [[Somali people]]; the latter includes [[Amharic language|Amharic]], spoken by the [[Amhara people]], and [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], spoken by the [[Tigray-Tigrinya people]]. Together, these four groups make up about three-quarters of Ethiopia's population. Other Afro-Asiatic languages with a significant number of speakers include the Cushitic [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]], [[Afar language|Afar]], [[Hadiyya language|Hadiyya]] and [[Agaw languages|Agaw]] languages, as well as the Semitic [[Gurage language|Gurage]], [[Harari language|Harari]], [[Silt'e language|Silt'e]] and [[Argobba language|Argobba]] tongues.&lt;ref name="Tphce"&gt;{{cite web|title=Country Level |url=http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=264&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=521 |work=2007 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia |publisher=[[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|CSA]] |date=13 July 2010 |accessdate=18 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114004942/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php?option=com_rubberdoc&amp;view=doc&amp;id=264&amp;format=raw&amp;Itemid=521 |archivedate=14 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Principal crops include [[coffee]], [[pulses]] (e.g. beans), [[oilseeds]], [[cereals]], [[potatoes]], [[sugarcane]], and vegetables. Many of the people traditionally herded cattle, goat or sheep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bxabeg.people.wm.edu/Ethiopia.Census%20Portrait.pdf Ethiopia: A Model Nation of Minorities] Berhanu Abegaz.

The Ethiopian state is ancient, dating back to at least the [[Aksumite Empire]] (which officially used the name "Ethiopia" in the 4th century) and its predecessor state, [[D`mt]] (with early 1st millennium BC roots). Despite two attempts at conquest by the [[Italians]], the country has remained independent for almost all its history. The [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Christian]] church has a long history in Ethiopia. It was founded in 316 AD by Meropius, a Christian philosopher from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marcus |first=Harold G. |title=A History of Ethiopia |edition=updated |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=0-520-22479-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atlas and Rif===
[[File:Berber-Tribe-Morocco.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Berber people|Berber]] family in the [[Atlas Mountains]] of [[Morocco]].]]
The [[Atlas Mountains|Atlas]] is a [[mountain range]] across a northern stretch of Africa extending about {{convert|2,400|km|mi|abbr=on}} through [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], and [[Tunisia]], or the [[Maghreb]]. The highest peak is [[Jbel Toubkal]], with an elevation of {{convert|4167|m|ft|0}} in southwestern Morocco. The second highest mountain is the [[M'Goun]] of {{convert|4071|m|ft|0}}.

The population of the Atlas Mountains are mainly [[berber people|Berber]] tribes, speakers of an [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language]], including the [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]], [[Chaoui]], [[Mozabite language|Mozabite]], [[Riffians]], [[Chleuh]], [[Sous]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and [[Zenata]]. Although nominally subject at times to [[Carthage]], the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Fatimid]] dynasty of [[Egypt]] (who originated in this area), the [[Ottoman Turks]] and more recently the French, for most of their history the tribes of the Atlas mountains have effectively been independent.

Most Berbers are farmers, living in mountains relatively close to the Mediterranean coast, but the Tuareg and Zenaga of the southern Sahara are nomadic. The Berbers are sometimes treated as minorities in their countries, which are dominated by their [[Arabic]]-speaking relatives nearer to the coast.&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Michael; &amp; Fentress, Elizabeth (1997). ''The Berbers (The Peoples of Africa)''. {{ISBN|0-631-16852-4}}. {{ISBN|0-631-20767-8}} (Pbk).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==

===Pyrenees, Cantabrian Mountains and Galicia===
[[File:Gaiteiros em romaria galega.jpg|thumb|[[Galician people|Galician]] ''gaiteiros'']]
The [[Pyrenees]] are a range of mountains in southwest Europe that form a natural border between France and Spain. Lower mountains extend to the west ([[Cantabrian Mountains]]) into [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]. The inhabitants of the Pyrenees speak Spanish, [[French language|French]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] (in [[Catalonia]] and [[Andorra]]) and the [[Basque language]]. A few speak the [[Occitan language]] (the [[Gascon language|Gascon]] and [[Languedocien]] dialects in France and the [[Aranese language|Aranese]] dialect in the [[Aran Valley]]), and [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]]. In the [[Cantabrian Mountains]] [[Basque Language|Basque]], [[Asturian Language|Asturian]] and the [[Cantabrian dialect]] are spoken, apart from Spanish. In fact [[Cantabrian people|Cantabrians]] have traditionally also been referred to as "montañeses" (highlanders or mountain people)

It is thought that [[Basque people]] are a remnant of the early inhabitants of Western Europe. Basque tribes were already mentioned in Roman times by [[Strabo]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], including the [[Vascones]], the [[Aquitani]] and others. Their language is quite distinct from the [[Indo-European languages]] spoken in most of Europe, and possibly (although there is much debate) is related to [[Northeast Caucasian languages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euskomedia.org/ A Basque Encyclopedia and other cultural and historical funds] (in Spanish, though it can be searched in English, Basque and French)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alps===
[[File:Pontifical Swiss Guards in their traditional uniform.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Swiss guards in their traditional uniform]]
The [[Alps]] are one of the great mountain ranges of Europe. They stretch from Austria and [[Slovenia]] in the east, through Italy, Switzerland, [[Liechtenstein]] and Germany, to France in the west. The highest mountain is Mont Blanc, at {{convert|4,808|m|ft|abbr=off}}, on the Italian–French border. The people of the Alps speak [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovene]] and [[Romansh language|Romansh]]. The German spoken in the [[Linguistic geography of Switzerland#German|German speaking part of Switzerland]] is a range of [[Swiss German|Swiss dialects]].

Early Alpine tribes included the [[Helvetii]] and [[Alemanni]]. The Swiss Confederacy was an alliance among the valley communities of the central Alps founded by three [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] in 1291, later expanding to form the nucleus of modern Switzerland. Disciplined [[Swiss mercenaries]] armed with [[Pike (weapon)#Renaissance heyday|pikes]] gained a formidable reputation during the perennial European wars of the Middle Ages.

In the [[Swiss peasant war of 1653]] the people rose up against the nobles and authorities. Although defeated, the revolt resulted in reforms that prevented the rise of [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]] as in other parts of Europe. The Swiss to this day have an unusual form of government where almost all major decisions are voted upon by the people.

The Alpine people have at times been subject in part or whole to neighboring countries, but many in the central Alps maintained the independence of their communities until 1848, when they combined into the federal state of Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse (DHS), Editions Gilles Attinger, Hauterive, {{ISBN|2-88256-133-4}} (2002-)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Italian Alps]] also contain a diverse array of mountain cultures and [[valley]] towns. In the southern Alps in [[Northern Italy]], the [[Camuni]] people are famous for their [[rock drawings in Valcamonica]].

===Apennines===
[[File:Castel del Monte 0328.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Castel del Monte (Abruzzo)|Castel del Monte]], one of [[Abruzzo]]'s little-known hill towns]]
The [[Apennine mountains]] in [[Italy]] were home to [[List of ancient Italian peoples|pre-Roman cultures]] and [[Italic tribes]] for centuries, most notably the [[Etruscans]], the mountainous peoples known as the [[Praetutii]] and [[Picentes]], the [[Vestini]], the [[Aequi]], and [[Oscan-Umbrian language|Oscan-Umbrian]] tribes, including the [[Sabines]], [[Umbri]], [[Samnites]], [[Marrucini]], [[Hernici]], [[Marsi]], and [[Paeligni]]. The Apennines were notably the birthplace of pre-Roman [[Apennine culture]], a cultural complex throughout the Apennines in [[central Italy|central]] and [[southern Italy]] spanning much of the [[Bronze Age]]. The people of the Apennine culture were cattle herdsmen grazing their ungulates over the meadows and groves of mountainous central Italy, though their range was not confined to the hills. These tribes lived in small hamlets located in defensible places. On the move between summer pastures they built temporary camps or lived in caves and rock shelters. Their pottery has been found on the [[Capitoline Hill]] in [[Rome]].

The Apennines stretch from modern day [[Liguria]] to [[Reggio Calabria]], and mountain towns and communities can be found throughout the whole of the Apennine mountain range. However, certain regions, especially [[Abruzzo]], [[Molise]], eastern [[Lazio]], [[Umbria]], and [[Marche]], are home to larger, more prototypical mountain cultures, and these cultures often remained largely isolated from the wider Italian peninsular culture until modern times. The region of Abruzzo in particular is well known for its mountain [[shepherd]] culture, with [[Province of Teramo|Teramo]], [[Province of Chieti|Chieti]], and [[Province of L'Aquila|L'Aquila]] being the most mountainous of Abruzzo's provinces. Abruzzo holds many of Italy's best-preserved and most beautiful medieval and Renaissance hill towns. The region is also the location of [[Gran Sasso]] and [[Parco Nazionale d'Abruzzo, Lazio e Molise|Abruzzo National Park]], a haven for mountain-dwelling fauna such as the [[Chamois|Abruzzo chamois]], [[Italian wolf]], and the [[Apennine brown bear]].

Shepherd culture, which often thrives in mountainous regions, has significantly influenced the cultures of the Abruzzese peoples and other central Apennine peoples. For instance, [[bagpipes]] known as [[zampogna]], traditionally made from [[sheep]] or [[goat]] skin or organs, are prominent in traditional Abruzzese and central and southern Apennine folk music. Sheep dishes such as [[arrosticini]] are also common in [[Cuisine of Abruzzo|Abruzzese cuisine]] and central Apennine cuisine. The region is also home to [[mountain dog]]s and [[Livestock guardian dog|sheep dogs]] such as the [[Pastore Maremmano-Abruzzese]], [[Italian Shepherd]], and [[Abruzzese Mastiff]], dog breeds used to protect sheep and livestock from predators in mountainous terrain. Further north, in [[Emilia-Romagna]], the shepherds in the Apennines near [[Reggio Emilia]] developed the shepherd dog breed [[Cane Lupino del Gigante]]. The [[Piccolo Segugio dell'Appennino]] is another Apennine dog breed found throughout the mountain range.

===Scottish Highlands===
[[File:Highland Dance 001.jpg|thumb|200px|Scottish [[highland dancing]]. The dancer is wearing kilt with [[sporran]], jacket, and bonnet while performing the [[sword dance]]]]
The [[Scottish Highlands]] include the rugged and mountainous regions of [[Scotland]] north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]]. They are inhabited by people of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] culture, although most now speak English. Traditionally the people lived by [[crofting]], or small-scale farming, growing crops such as [[oats]], [[barley]] and [[kale]], and supplemented their diet with fish and [[red deer]].

On festive occasions, the people eat [[haggis]], made from a sheep's heart, liver and lungs, minced with onion, oatmeal, suet, spices, and salt, mixed with stock, and boiled in the animal's stomach for three hours. The haggis was immortalized by the lowland poet [[Robert Burns]] in his [[Burns supper#Entrance of the haggis|''Address to a Haggis'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dickson Wright | first = Clarissa | authorlink = Clarissa Dickson Wright | title = The Haggis: A Little History.  | publisher = Pelican Publishing Company | year = 1998 | isbn =  1-56554-364-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Scottish clan]]s have a tradition of feuding among each other and resisting the authority of the central government based in the lowland city of [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adam, Frank; [[Thomas Innes of Learney|Innes of Learney, Thomas]]|title=The Clans, Septs &amp; Regiments of the Scottish Highlands|edition=8th|year=1970|publisher=Johnston and Bacon|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Scottish regiment|Highland regiments]] went to war wearing [[tartan]] [[kilts]] accompanied by bagpipe players &amp;ndash; a sight and sound calculated to strike fear into the hearts of their enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalhighlanders.co.uk/ royalhighlanders.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930221719/http://www.royalhighlanders.co.uk/ |date=2011-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Balkan Mountains]] run 560&amp;nbsp;km from the Vrashka Chuka Peak on the border between [[Bulgaria]] and eastern [[Serbia]] eastward through central Bulgaria to [[Cape Emine]] on the [[Black Sea]]. The highest peaks of the Stara planina are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is [[Botev Peak|Botev]] (2,376 m).

Lying between Austria, Italy, Turkey and the [[Ukraine]], the Balkans have had a turbulent history. At different times different parts of the Balkans were controlled by the [[Macedon#Empire|Macedonian]], [[Roman Empire|Roman]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] empires.

The Balkans are home to people speaking [[Slavic languages]] ([[Serbs]], [[Croats]], [[Bulgarians]] and [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]]), [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (related to [[Italian language|Italian]]), [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and other languages. Through its history many other ethnic groups with their own languages lived in the area, among them [[Thracians]], [[Illyrians]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Pechenegs]], [[Cumans]], [[Avars (Carpathians)|Avars]], [[Celts]], [[Germans]] and various Germanic tribes. In addition to language, the people are divided by religion, adhering to the [[Roman Catholic]], [[Greek Orthodox]], and [[Muslim]] religions, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jelavich |first=Barbara |authorlink=Barbara Jelavich  |title=History of the Balkans |date=1983-07-29 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caucasus===
[[File:Caucasus-ethnic en.svg|thumb|200px|Ethnolinguistic groups in the Caucasus region]]
The [[Caucasus Mountains]] is a range between the [[Black sea]] and the [[Caspian sea]]. It is home to Europe's highest mountain ([[Mount Elbrus]]). Modern countries of the Caucasus are [[Chechnya]], [[Ingushetia]], [[Republic of Dagestan|Dagestan]], [[Republic of Adygea|Adyghea]], [[Kabardino-Balkaria]], [[Karachay–Cherkessia]], [[North Ossetia]], [[Krasnodar Krai]] and [[Stavropol Krai]], all parts of the [[Russian Federation]], and the independent countries of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] (including the disputed [[Abkhazia]] and [[South Ossetia]]), [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and Turkey.

The people of these mountains have very diverse origins, with cultures influenced by periods of [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]], [[Iran]]ian and [[Russians|Russian]] control. Some, including the Georgians and Armenians, are mostly Christian, while others are [[Muslim]] in religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v5f1/v5f1a032.html Caucasus and Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012140601/http://iranica.com/newsite/articles/v5f1/v5f1a032.html |date=2007-10-12 }} entry in [[Encyclopædia Iranica]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindu Kush and Balochistan===
[[File:Ghilzai nomads in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Ghilzai]] [[nomads]] of Afghanistan.]]
The [[Hindu Kush]] is a mountain range located between [[Afghanistan]] and Pakistan. It is the westernmost extension of the [[Pamir Mountains]], the [[Karakoram Range]], and is a sub-range of the [[Himalayas]]. Lower mountains including the [[Sulaiman Range]] extend south to the [[Arabian Sea]].

The people of this region generally speak [[Indo-Iranian languages]] such as [[Pashto language|Pashto]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], and languages of the [[Dardic languages|Dardic]] and [[Nuristani languages|Nuristani]] groups. The [[Brahui people]] speak a [[Dravidian language]]. There are many distinct tribes. The history of the region has been turbulent, lying in the path of invasions from the [[Persia]]ns, the [[Greeks]] under [[Alexander the Great]], the [[Arabs]], [[Mughals]] and British. Given the rugged geography, central governments have generally had limited control over the tribes, a situation that persists to this day.&lt;ref&gt;Banuazizi, Ali and [[Myron Weiner]] (eds.). 1994. The Politics of Social Transformation in Afghanistan, Iran, and Pakistan (Contemporary Issues in the Middle East), Syracuse University Press. {{ISBN|0-8156-2608-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pamirs===
The Pamir Mountains are in [[Central Asia]], formed by the junction of the [[Tian Shan]], [[Karakoram]], [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]], and [[Hindu Kush]] ranges. They are among the world's highest mountains and in Victorian times they were known as the 'Roof of the World'. The people of this region are mostly [[Tajik people]], and speak [[Pamir languages]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]] (closely related to [[Persian language|Persian]]), [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]] and [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]].

===Himalayas===
[[File:Baba in Nepal.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Old sadhu with white beard in Nepal.]]
The [[Himalayas]] lie between the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the [[Tibetan Plateau]], thrown up by the collision of two [[tectonic plates]]. They include world's highest peaks including [[Mount Everest]] and [[K2]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} The Himalayas stretch across [[Bhutan]], China, India, [[Nepal]], Pakistan and [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

People have filtered into the mountains from the northern plateau and from the southern plains and intermingled. They mostly speak [[Tibeto-Burman languages]] such as [[Gurung language|Gurung]] and [[Nepal Bhasa]] or [[Indo-Aryan languages]] such as [[Garhwali language|Garhwali]], [[Shina language|Shina]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Dogri]], [[Northern Indo-Aryan languages|Pahari]] (which means "language of the mountain people"), [[Kumauni language|Kumaoni]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]] and [[Assamese language|Asamiya]].&lt;ref&gt;''Anthologia anthropologica. The native races of Asia and Europe;'' by James George Frazer, Sir; Robert Angus Downie&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Gurkha]] people of Nepal are well known for their history of bravery and strength, and still serve in foreign armies such as the [[British Army]]'s [[Brigade of Gurkhas]] and the [[Indian Army]]'s [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas/ Brigade of Gurkhas website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220195813/http://www.army.mod.uk/brigade_of_gurkhas |date=2008-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fruit, vegetables and sheep flourish in the fertile valley of [[Kashmir]]. The people have evolved the unique and famous [[Kashmiri cuisine]] with Iranian, Indian and Turkic origins. While the stricter [[Hindus]] may restrict themselves to rice with vegetables, curd, milk and fresh fruit, the [[Muslims]] eat [[pilaf]] and [[mutton]] stuffed with spices, [[apricots]] stuffed with mutton, roast kid, fish and honey rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Godden | first =  Rumer | year = 1953 | title = Kingfishers Catch Fire | publisher = MacMillan | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further east, a typical Nepalese meal includes ''Dal'', a spicy lentil soup, served over ''bhat'' (boiled rice) with ''tarkari'' (curried vegetables) together with ''achar'' (pickles) or ''chutni'' (spicy condiment made from fresh ingredients). In the hills of Nepal, people enjoy their own kind of music, playing [[sarangi]] (a string instrument), [[madal]] (a hand drum) and [[flute]]. They also have many popular folk songs known as lok geet and lok dohari.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.nationalgeographic.com/places/countries/country_nepal.html National Geographic Country Profile: Nepal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southeast Asian Massif and Zomia{{anchor|South-East Asia}}===
[[File:Elderly Akha woman2.jpg|thumb|left|Elderly Akha woman, Northeast Thailand]]
The mainland portion of [[Southeast Asia]] consists of [[Cambodia]], [[Laos]], [[Burma]], [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]], and [[Assam]] in India. The hills of this region include tribes of [[Tibeto-Burman]] peoples including the [[Akha people|Akha]], [[Bodo-Kachari]], [[Lahu people|Lahu]], [[Karen people|Karen]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]] Mien, [[Mizo people|Mizo]] (Mizo is under the sub-group of [[Zo people|Zomi]] )and [[Lisu people|Lisu]]. It is thought that they drifted down into the area from [[Tibet]].

Many of the tribes are spread across more than one country; the Karen people live in Burma and Thailand, the [[Zomi people]] live in the [[Chin State]], [[Sagaing Region]] of [[Burma]] and the [[Mizoram State]], [[Manipur]] in [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. The Zomi are known as Chin-Kuki-Mizo. Their language is common or overlap approximately more than 40%. They live with three countries: India, Burma and [[Bangladesh]]. The Akha people live in small villages among the mountains of China, Laos, [[Burma]], and northern Thailand. They often retain their traditional way of life but are under increasing pressure to do so. As minorities, they tend to be less well off than the majority of people in the countries where they live.

Interesting theorisations about the hill people from this region include the notions of "Southeast Asian Massif" and "Zomia". [[Southeast Asian Massif]] was proposed by Laval University anthropologist Jean Michaud in 1997. This high region extending eastward from the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau covers more than 2.5 million square kilometers and comprises nearly one hundred million marginal peoples. This large area is inside the fringe of ten states and at the middle of none, stretching across the standard regional designations (South Asia, East Asia, and Southeast Asia); along with its ecological diversity and its relation to states, it arouses a lot of interest. It stands for an original entity of study, a type of international Appalachia, and a different way in which to study regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Michaud | first= Jean |title= Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif| publisher= Scarecrow Press| year= 2006| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zomia (region)|Zomia]] is a geographical term coined in 2002 by historian Willem van Schendel of the University of Amsterdam to refer to the huge massif of mainland Southeast Asia that has historically been beyond the control of governments based in the population centers of the lowlands. The massif arose during the Alpine orogeny, when the African, Indian and Cimmerian Plates, and smaller Asian terrains, collided with that of Eurasia. The name is from Zomi, a term for highlander common to several related Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in the India-Bangladesh-Burma border area.

The exact boundaries of Zomia differ among scholars: all would include the highlands of north Indochina (north Vietnam and all Laos,) Thailand, the Shan State of northern Burma, and the mountains of Southwest China, others extend the region as far west as Tibet, north India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. These areas share a common elevated, rugged terrain, and have been the home of ethnic minorities that have preserved their local cultures by residing far from state control and influence. Other scholars have used the term to discuss the similar ways that Southeast Asian governments have handled minority groups. Once such is Yale University Professor [[James C. Scott]], who address the issue in his 2009 book ''[[The Art of Not Being Governed|The Art of Not Being Governed: An Anarchist History of Upland Southeast Asia]]''. From the Preface:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Hill tribes] seen from the valley kingdoms as “our living ancestors,” “what we were like before we discovered wet-rice cultivation, Buddhism, and civilization” [are on the contrary] best understood as runaway, fugitive, maroon communities who have, over the course of two millennia, been fleeing the oppressions of state-making projects in the valleys — slavery, conscription, taxes, corvée labor, epidemics, and warfare.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Thailand===
A 2013 newspaper article from the [[Bangkok Post]] said that "Nearly a million hill people and forest dwellers are still treated as outsiders, criminals even, since most live in protected forests. Viewed as national security threats, hundreds of thousands of them are refused citizenship although many are natives to the land."&lt;ref name=Thainess&gt;[http://bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/366720/time-ripe-for-whole-new-take-on-thainess Time ripe for whole new take on 'Thainess']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vietnam===
The [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] of Vietnam have traditionally been populated by a majority of hill tribes, all of whom are culturally distinct from the ethnic Vietnamese population of the lowlands. Collectively known as [[Degar|Montagnard]] (French for "mountain people"), they are also referred derogatorily as ''mọi'' (literally "savage" in Vietnamese).&lt;ref&gt;H. Maître (1909) [https://books.google.com/books?id=iGu5mgEACAAJ ''Les Régions Moi du Sud-lndochinois: Le plateau de Darlac'']&lt;/ref&gt; While Vietnamese expansion into the Central Highlands dates back to the [[French Indochina|French colonial period]], large-scale settlement did not occur until after the [[Vietnam War]]. Today, the Montagnards form a minority in much of the Central Highlands, with the exception of a few areas.&lt;ref name=minority&gt;General Statistics Office (1996): Population Data of Sparsely Populated Areas in Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi&lt;/ref&gt;

Local Vietnamese assisted French colonial armies in suppressing rebellions among the hill tribes during the early 20th century, with some calls for completely ridding the Central Highlands of the "uncivilized" hill tribes for large-scale Vietnamese and French settlement. Political and economic barriers prevented hill tribes from obtaining high levels of education and entering commerce, although outright legal discrimination against Montagnards was made illegal by the colonial government.&lt;ref&gt;AOM Gougal F 03.79: Annexe du rapport politique de l'Annam, 9/1937&lt;/ref&gt; During the Vietnam War, [[Special Forces (United States Army)|American Special Forces]] trained many hill tribes in Vietnam to stop Viet Cong activity in the region and to prevent them from aligning with the Viet Cong.&lt;ref name= cmh&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.history.army.mil/BOOKS/Vietnam/90-23/90-23C.htm | title =  History of Special Forces in Vietnam, 1961-1971  | publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]] | first = Francis John | last = Kelly | origyear = 1973| year = 1989 | location = Washington, D.C.| id =CMH Pub 90-23

===New Guinea highlands===
[[File:KorowaiHombre01.jpg|thumb|[[Korowai people|Korowai]] tribesman]]
[[New Guinea]], located just north of Australia, is the world's second-largest island. A central east-west mountain range dominates the geography of New Guinea and contains the highest mountains in [[Oceania]], rising up to 4884 m high. The island is populated by very nearly a thousand different tribal groups and a near-equivalent number of separate languages, which makes New Guinea the most linguistically diverse area in the world. They fall into one of two groups, speakers of the [[Papuan languages]] and later arrivals who speak [[Austronesian languages]].

The gardens of the [[New Guinea Highlands]] are ancient, intensive [[permaculture]]s, adapted to high population densities, very high rainfalls (as high as 10,000&amp;nbsp;mm/yr (400 in/yr)), earthquakes, hilly land, and occasional frost. The people use complex mulches, crop rotations and tillages on terraces with complex irrigation systems. Native gardeners are as or more successful than most scientific farmers in raising certain crops. Early garden crops &amp;ndash; many of which are indigenous &amp;ndash; included [[sugarcane]], Pacific [[banana]]s, [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], and [[taro]], while [[sago]] and [[pandanus]] were two commonly exploited native forest crops. Today's staples &amp;ndash; [[sweet potato]]es and pigs &amp;ndash; are later arrivals.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. ''Collapse''. (German translation), Frankfurt 2005, p. 350.&lt;/ref&gt;

The people of New Guinea were traditionally warlike, with constant feuds over territory, although violence has greatly reduced in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Customary Land Tenure in Papua New Guinea: Status and Prospects | author=Lynne Armitage |publisher=Queensland University of Technology | url=http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00001043/00/armitage.pdf | archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20050906101634/http://dlc.dlib.indiana.edu/archive/00001043/00/armitage.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2005-09-06 |format=PDF |accessdate= 2005-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Americas==

===Appalachians===
{{Main article|Appalachia}}
The [[Appalachian Mountains]] are a vast system of mountains in eastern North America. Before the Europeans reached the area around 1650, the mountains were inhabited by [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]] people; speakers of [[Iroquoian languages]] such as the [[Cherokee]]; and [[Siouan]] people such as the [[Occaneechi]], [[Tutelo]] and [[Monacan (tribe)|Monacan]]. Upon European arrival to the mountains, the American Indians were [[Indian Removal|driven west]] through a series of laws, wars, and treaties.  Many of these early inhabitants also died from European diseases (e.g. [[smallpox]]).  Few of the early inhabitants remain,&lt;ref&gt;Snipp, C. M. ''American Indians: The first of this land''. New York: Russell Sage Foundation, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; but surviving communities include the [[Ramapough Mountain Indians]] and the [[Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians]].

European migration was primarily led by the [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]], a group of people from northern England, the [[Scottish Lowlands]] (versus the [[Scottish Highlands]]) and [[Ulster|Ulster, Ireland]].  These yeoman farmers were romanticized for their independence, ruggedness, and self-sufficiency, perhaps best represented by the frontiersman [[Daniel Boone]].  The Appalachian settlers often had a hostile relationship with their lowland coastal neighbors, sometimes culminating in revolts like the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator Movement]] and the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].&lt;ref name=drake&gt;Drake, Richard. ''A History of Appalachia'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[American Civil War]], tensions were so high between hill peoples and lowland peoples that 55 Appalachian counties broke away from the state of [[Virginia]] to form [[West Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/statehood/statehood12.html |title="Chapter Twelve "Reorganized Government of Virginia Approves Separation" |publisher=Wvculture.org |date= |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, negative stereotypes of the region and its people began to develop.  The [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]] (1878–1891) was widely reported and encouraged the stereotype of violent, vengeful and impoverished people.  The 1972 film ''[[Deliverance]]'' depicted the hill people as backward, hostile to outsiders, and potentially inbred (a stereotype of the "[[Hillbilly]]" culture).&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0068473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the creation of the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] in 1965, the economic situation of the region has improved dramatically, and some aspects of the hillbilly stereotype have disappeared.  However, the people of Appalachia are still commonly viewed as uneducated and unrefined.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. see Walker, Matthew H. "Discrimination Based on National Origin and Ancestry: How the Goals of Equality Have Failed to Address the Pervasive Stereotyping of the Appalachian Tradition", 38 ''U. Dayton L. Rev.'' 335 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rocky Mountains===
[[File:mesaverde cliffpalace 20030914.752.jpg|thumb|left|275px|Cliff Palace, [[Mesa Verde National Park]]]]
The [[Rocky Mountains]] stretch more than {{convert|4,800|km|mi|sp=us}} from northernmost [[British Columbia]], in Canada, to [[New Mexico]], in the United States. The range's highest peak is [[Mount Elbert]] in [[Colorado]] at {{convert|14,440|ft|m|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level.

As the Europeans continued to move west, they took most of the lands of the people who lived in the Rockies, forcing the [[Ute tribe|Ute]], [[Navajo people|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], [[Apache]], [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] and other tribes to assimilate or move onto reservations. Some adapted to farming or sheep herding, but they are the most impoverished of all ethnic groups in the USA.

The [[Ancient Pueblo peoples]] who lived in the present-day [[Four Corners]] area of the [[Southwestern United States]] were noted for their distinctive pottery and dwelling construction styles. The cultural group is often referred to as the [[Anasazi]]. Some of their unusual cliff dwellings still stand today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpluhna.nau.edu/People/population_change.htm An Early Population Explosion on the Colorado Plateau] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205191339/http://cpluhna.nau.edu/People/population_change.htm |date=2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ishi]] (c. 1860 – March 25, 1916) was presumed to be the last member of the [[Yahi people]], the last surviving group of the [[Yana people]] in the U.S. state of California. What is now the [[Western United States]] has long been home to [[indigenous peoples of the Great Basin]], who live mainly in desert regions and share characteristic with hill people.

===Mexican Sierras===

[[File:Jose Guadalupe Guzman.jpg|thumb|right|José Guadalupe Guzmán playing the [[bajo sexto]].]]
The [[American Cordillera]] in Mexico includes the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] and [[Sierra Madre del Sur]]. The mountain valleys have a temperate climate and fertile soil, and were the cradles of [[Mesoamerica]]n civilizations that flourished long before Europeans discovered the area, including the [[Olmec civilization|Olmec]],  [[Teotihuacán]], [[Toltec]], [[Aztec]], [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] and [[Mixtec]] cultures. The bold patterns and deep saturated colors of the Mesoamerican artists are echoed in modern [[Mexican art]] and architecture.

After the Spanish invasion of 1519, led by [[Hernán Cortés]], most people eventually adopted the [[Spanish language]], but there remain many groups who retain their original languages and live traditional ways of life. These include the [[Nahuatl]], [[Zapotec people|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], [[Otomí people|Otomí]], [[Tzotzil people|Tzotzil]], [[Tzeltal people|Tzeltal]], [[Mazahua people|Mazahua]], [[Mazateco]], [[Chinantec]], [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]], [[Mixe]] and [[Tlapanec people|Tlapanec]].&lt;ref name="cdi"&gt;[http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=3 Los pueblos indígenas de México], Comisión Nacional para el Desarrollo de los Pueblos Indígenas&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional Mexican diet is based on [[maize]], beans, [[chili pepper]]s, [[tomato]]es, [[cactus]] and other native plants, supplemented by [[iguana]], [[rattlesnake]], fish and venison. [[Mexican cuisine]] today is one of the most rich and varied in the world.&lt;ref name="Long-solís2005"&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Long-solís | first1 = Janet | last2 = Vargas | first2 = Luis Alberto | year = 2005 | title = Food culture in Mexico | isbn = 978-0-313-32431-4 | publisher = Greenwood Press | location = Westport, Conn. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the Spanish came, the inhabitants of the land used [[drum]]s, [[flute]]s, [[maraca]]s, [[seashell]]s and voices to make music and dances. This ancient music is still played in some parts of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/worldmusic/view/page.basic/genre/content.genre/mexican_regional_756 National Geographic World Music entry - Mexico]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Andes===
[[File:A Quechua girl and her Llama.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Quechua people|Quechua]] girl and her llama in [[Cuzco]]]]
The [[Andes]] form the world's longest exposed mountain range, a continuous chain of highland along the western coast of South America. The range is over {{convert|7,000|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|200|-|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide (widest between 18° to 20°S latitude), and of an average height of about {{convert|4,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

Before the Spanish invasion led by [[Francisco Pizarro]] in 1532 the Andes were primarily inhabited by [[Quechua people]]s such as the [[Inca]], [[Chancas]], [[Huancas]] and [[Cañari]] in the north, and [[Aymaras]] further south. Their economy was based on the [[potato]] crop, which originated in the area, and the [[llama]] and [[alpaca]], used for their wool and meat. Unlike most mountain people, the inhabitants of the Andes appear to have been generally unwarlike.&lt;ref&gt;Mariátegui, José Carlos, Siete ensayos de interpretación de la realidad peruana, Ediciones Era, 1979, p 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>It looks like this tangential sentence is only here to advance a particular belief. It's not relevant to the description of what late-term abortion is, which is the purpose of this section. (Plus in any case, a ''pregnancy'' can't be alive or dead.)</comment>

Wade'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/410/113.html 410 U.S. 113] (1972). Findlaw.com. Retrieved 2011-04-14.&lt;/ref&gt; is a termination of [[pregnancy]] that is performed during a later stage of pregnancy. Late termination of pregnancy is [[Abortion in the United States#By trimester of pregnancy|more controversial]] than abortion in general because it results in the death of a [[fetus]] that is more developed and sometimes [[fetal viability|able to survive independently]]. Given the complex, gradual nature of [[human fetal development]], the definition of "late" in this context is not precise, and different medical publications have discussed the varying [[gestational age]] points that can be involved.

==Definition==
A late termination of pregnancy often refers to an induced ending of pregnancy after the [[Gestational age|20th week]] of [[gestation]]. The exact point when a pregnancy becomes late-term, however, is not clearly defined. Some sources define an abortion after 16 weeks as "late".&lt;ref name="Torres"&gt;Torres, Aida and Forrest, Jacqueline Darroch. (1988). [http://www.holysmoke.org/fem/fem0543.htm Why Do Women Have Abortions]. ''Family Planning Perspectives, 20 (4)'', 169-176. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weihe, Pál, Steuerwald, Ulrike,  Taheri, Sepideh, Færø, Odmar, Veyhe, Anna Sofía, &amp; Nicolajsen, Did. (2003). [http://www2.mst.dk/udgiv/publications/2003/87-7972-477-9/pdf/87-7972-478-7.pdf The Human Health Programme in the Faroe Islands 1985-2001]. In ''AMAP Greenland and the Faroe Islands 1997-2001''. Danish Ministry of Environment. Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Three articles published in 1998 in the same issue of the ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' could not agree on the definition. Two of the ''JAMA'' articles chose the 20th week of gestation to be the point where an abortion procedure would be considered late-term.&lt;ref&gt;Sprang, M.L, and Neerhof, M.G. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/744 Rationale for banning abortions late in pregnancy]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8),'' 744-747.&lt;br /&gt;Grimes, D.A. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/747 The continuing need for late abortions]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8)'', 747-750.&lt;/ref&gt; The third ''JAMA'' article chose the third trimester, or 27th week of gestation.&lt;ref name="Jama2"&gt;Gans Epner, J.E., Jonas, H.S., Seckinger, D.L. (1998). [http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/280/8/724 Late-term abortion]. ''Journal of the American Medical Association, 280 (8)'', 724-729.&lt;/ref&gt;

The point at which an abortion becomes late-term is often related to the "[[Fetus#Viability|viability]]" (ability to survive outside the [[uterus]]) of the [[fetus]]. Sometimes late-term abortions are referred to as post-viability abortions.

==Mental health==
While a single first-trimester abortion carried no more mental health risk than carrying a pregnancy to term, abortion could not be proven safe in other cases as far as mental health was concerned. Women who terminate a pregnancy because of abnormalities discovered through fetal screenings have a similar risk of negative mental health outcomes as women who miscarry a wanted pregnancy or experience a stillbirth or the death of a newborn. However, "the differing patterns of psychological experiences observed among women who terminate an unplanned pregnancy versus those who terminate a planned and wanted pregnancy highlight the importance of taking pregnancy intendedness and wantedness into account when seeking to understand psychological reactions to abortion."&lt;ref name="apa-2008"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.apa.org/pi/women/programs/abortion/index.aspx | title = Mental Health and Abortion | publisher = [[American Psychological Association]] | year = 2008 | accessdate = April 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reasons ==

===United States===
{{See also|Abortion in the United States#Reasons for abortions|l1=Reasons for abortions}}

A study from 2013 found that most women seeking late-term abortion "fit at least one of five profiles: They were raising children alone, were depressed or using illicit substances, were in conflict with a male partner or experiencing domestic violence, had trouble deciding and then had access problems, or were young and nulliparous."  The study data did not include any women who were having abortions "on grounds of fetal anomaly or life endangerment." The researchers concluded that "Bans on abortion after 20 weeks will disproportionately affect young women and women with limited financial resources."&lt;ref name=Foster2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Diana|title=Who Seeks Abortions at or After 20 Weeks?|journal=Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health|date=December 2013|volume=45|issue=4|pages=210–218|doi=10.1363/4521013|url=https://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/4521013.html|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an earlier study published in 1987, the Alan Guttmacher Institute collected questionnaires from 1,900 women in the United States who came to clinics to have abortions. Of the 1,900 questioned, 420 had been pregnant for 16 or more weeks. These 420 women were asked to choose among a list of reasons they had not obtained the abortions earlier in their pregnancies.  The results were as follows:&lt;ref name="Torres" /&gt;
* 71% of women were unaware they were pregnant or misjudged gestation
* 48% of women found it hard to make arrangements for abortion
* 33% of women were afraid to tell their partner or parents
* 24% of women took longer to decide whether to have an abortion
* 8% of women had an abortion after a change in their relationship status
* 8% of women were initially pressured not to have abortion
* 6% of women chose to have an abortion because of a change in circumstances after becoming pregnant
* 6% of women were not properly educated on how timing affects abortion
* 5% of women were unaware that abortion was available to them
* 2% A fetal problem was diagnosed late in pregnancy
* 11% Other

=== England and Wales ===
The NHS records the reasons given for abortions at all stages of development. In 2015, 2,877 abortions were performed at 20 weeks or above. Of these, 23 (0.8%)&lt;!-- Ground A (alone, or with B, C, D) or F or G  --&gt; were performed to save the life of the pregnant woman, 1,801&lt;!-- C (alone) --&gt; (63%) were performed for mental or physical health reasons, and 1046&lt;!-- Ground E (alone, or with A, B, C or D)  --&gt; (36%) were performed because of foetal abnormalities. (The data do not sum up to 100% because multiple reasons could be recorded for each abortion.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/529344/Abortion_Statistics_2015_v3.pdf|title=Report on abortion statistics in England and Wales for 2015|last=Department of Health|first=|date=17 May 2016|issue=|doi=|volume=|page=31 (Table 7b)|pmid=|access-date=2016-10-24|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal restrictions==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Intact dilation and extraction]] --&gt;
As of 1998, among the 152 most populous countries, 54 either banned abortion entirely or permitted it only to save the life of the pregnant woman.&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;Anika Rahman, Laura Katzive and Stanley K. Henshaw. [http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2405698.pdf A Global Review of Laws on Induced Abortion, 1985-1997], International Family Planning Perspectives (Volume 24, Number 2, June 1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, 49 of the 152 most populous countries were without restriction as to reason, but 44 of these imposed limits after a particular [[gestational age]]:&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

* 12 weeks (Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cuba, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Georgia, Greece, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Rep., Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Moldova, Mongolia, Norway, Russian Federation, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Ukraine, Tajikistan,  Tunisia, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan)
* 13 weeks (Italy)
* 14 weeks (Austria, Cambodia, Germany, Hungary, and Romania)
* 18 weeks (Sweden)
* 24 weeks (Singapore)
* no limit (Canada, China, and North Korea)
* viability (Netherlands and to some extent the United States)

In these countries, abortions after the general gestational age limit are allowed only under restricted circumstances, which include, depending on country, risk to the woman's life, physical or mental health, fetal malformation, cases where the pregnancy was the result of rape, or poor socio-economic conditions. For instance, in Italy, abortion is allowed on request up until 90 days, after which it is allowed only if the pregnancy or childbirth pose a threat to the woman’s life, a risk to physical health of the woman, a risk to mental health of the woman; if there is a risk of fetal malformation; or if the pregnancy is the result of rape or other sexual crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313162004/http://www.ippfen.org/NR/rdonlyres/2EB28750-BA71-43F8-AE2A-8B55A275F86C/0/Abortion_legislation_Europe_Jan2007.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Denmark provides a wider range of reasons, including social and economic ones, which can be invoked by a woman who seeks an abortion after 12 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/population/abortion/Denmark.abo.htm|title=DENMARK|author=|date=|work=harvard.edu|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abortions at such stages must in general be approved by a doctor or a special committee, unlike early abortions which are performed on demand. The ease with which the doctor or the committee allows a late term abortion varies significantly by country, and is often influenced by the social and religious views prevalent in that region.

Some countries, like Canada, China (Mainland only) and Vietnam have no legal limit on when an abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;

===United States===
{{See also|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act}}
The [[United States Supreme Court]] decisions on abortion, including ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'',  allow states to impose more restrictions on post-viability abortions than during the earlier stages of pregnancy.

As of December 2014, forty-two states had bans on late-term abortions that were not [[Facial challenge|facially]] unconstitutional under ''Roe v. Wade'' or [[enjoined]] by court order.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;Guttmacher Institute. (April 1, 2007). [http://www.guttmacher.org/statecenter/spibs/spib_PLTA.pdf State Policies on Later-Term Abortions]. ''State Policies in Brief.''  Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' ruled that Congress may ban certain late-term abortion techniques, "both previability and postviability",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Annas|first1=George J.|title=The Supreme Court and Abortion Rights|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=24 May 2007|volume=2007|issue=356|pages=2201–2207|doi=10.1056/NEJMhle072595|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMhle072595|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it had done in banning [[intact dilation and extraction]] with the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hern|first1=Warren M.|title=Did I violate the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2003/10/did_i_violate_the_partialbirth_abortion_ban.html|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=Slate.com|date=22 Oct 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court has held that bans must include exceptions for threats to the woman's life, physical health, and mental health, but four states allow late-term abortions only when the woman's life is at risk; four allow them when the woman's life or physical health is at risk, but use a definition of health that pro-choice organizations believe is impermissibly narrow.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  Note that just because a portion of a state's law is found to be unconstitutional does not mean that the entire law will be deemed unconstitutional: "[I]nvalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief," meaning the court could declare that only those parts of the law that are violative of the Constitution are invalid (declaratory relief), or that the court can prohibit the state from enforcing those portions of the law (injunctive relief).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ayotte v. Planned Parenthood]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/04-1144.html 546 U.S. 320] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Eighteen states prohibit abortion after a certain number of weeks' gestation (usually 22 weeks from the last menstrual period).&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court held in ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' that a statute may create "a presumption of viability" after a certain number of weeks, in which case the physician must be given an opportunity to rebut the presumption by performing tests.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster v. Reproductive Health Services'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=492&amp;invol=490 492 U.S. 490] (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; Because this provision is not explicitly written into these state laws, as it was in the Missouri law examined in ''Webster'', pro-choice organizations believe that such a state law is unconstitutional, but only "to the extent that it prohibits pre-viability abortions".&lt;ref name="Delaware"&gt;NARAL Pro-Choice America. (2007). "[http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/choice-action-center/in_your_state/who-decides/state-profiles/delaware.html?templateName=lawdetails&amp;issueID=3&amp;ssumID=2516 Delaware]."  ''Who Decides? The Status of Women's Reproductive Rights in the United States.'' Retrieved April 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten states (although Florida's enforcement of such laws are under [[permanent injunction]]) require a second physician's approval before a late-term abortion can be performed.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;  The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a requirement of "confirmation by two other physicians" (rather than one other physician) because "acquiescence by co-practitioners has no rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly infringes on the physician's right to practice".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Doe v. Bolton]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=410&amp;invol=179 410 U.S. 179] (1973).&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-choice organizations, such as the [[Guttmacher Institute]], posit that some of these state laws are unconstitutional, based on these and other Supreme Court rulings, at least to the extent that these state laws require approval of a second or third physician.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt;

Thirteen states have laws that require a second physician to be present during late-term abortion procedures in order to treat a fetus if born alive.&lt;ref name="state" /&gt; The Court has held that a doctor's right to practice is not infringed by requiring a second physician to be present at abortions performed after viability in order to assist in the case of a living fetus.&lt;ref&gt;''Planned Parenthood Ass'n v. Ashcroft'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/462/476/case.html 462 U.S. 476], 486-90 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
There are at least four medical procedures associated with late-term abortions:
* [[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&amp;E)
* Early [[labor induction]] (sometimes called "induction abortion")
* [[Intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX or D&amp;X), sometimes referred to as "[[Partial birth abortion#Partial-birth abortion|''partial-birth abortion'']]"
* [[Hysterotomy abortion]]

==Viability==
There is no sharp limit of development, age, or weight at which humans automatically become viable.&lt;ref name="developinghuman"&gt;Moore, Keith and Persaud, T.

'''Laurie L. Patton''' (born November 14, 1961) is an [[Americans|American]] academic, author and poet who serves as the 17th President of [[Middlebury College]]. Previously, she was the Charles Howard Candler Professor of Early Indian Religions at [[Emory University]] before assuming the role of Robert F. Durden Professor of Religion and Dean of Arts and Sciences at [[Duke University]].

Patton was named Middlebury's 17th President on  November 18, 2014, and became Middlebury's first woman president upon taking office on July 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.middlebury.edu/offices/technology/help/mediaserv/stream&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=2008-12-01 |title=Mumbai is Not 9/11 |first=Laurie |last=Patton |newspaper=Religious Dispatches |url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/797/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140604090208/http://www.religiondispatches.org/archive/politics/797/ |archivedate=June 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton graduated from [[Choate Rosemary Hall]] in Wallingford, Connecticut, holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], a doctorate from the [[University of Chicago]], and was awarded a Fulbright Scholarship in 2000. She focuses her research on early Indian rituals, narrative and mythology, literary theory in religious studies, and [[Hinduism]] in modern India. She has published on the interpretation of early Indian ritual and narrative, comparative mythology, literary theory in the study of religion, women and Hinduism in contemporary India, and religion and conflict.

Her early Indological work applies literary theory and theory of canon to the texts of early India, particularly Vedic texts. Later, she used a theory of metonymy to rethink the application of mantras in early Indian ritual.  Her first edited work, ''Authority, Anxiety, and Canon'' (1994) surveyed the larger field of Vedic interpretation as it existed in various intellectual contexts throughout India.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunypress.edu/p-1849-authority-anxiety-and-canon.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

She was co-editor on ''Myth and Method'' an assessment of the state of the field in comparative mythology. Her co-edited work with Edwin Bryant (2005) brings together for the first time a variety of differing perspectives on the problem of Aryan origins.

Patton has also worked on gender questions, beginning with her edited volume, ''Jewels of Authority'' (2002), which examined early feminist stereotypes about women in Indian textual traditions as well as contemporary life.  Her recent articles on gender are derived from her present project, the first ethnography of women Sanskritists ever to be undertaken in India.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Her translation of the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'' in the [[Penguin Classics]] Series follows a free verse style constrained by eight line stanzas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stainton|first1=Hamsa|title=Review: The Bhagavad Gita|url=http://www.saglobalaffairs.com/book-reviews/191-review-the-bhagavad-gita.html|website=SAGlobalAffairs.com|publisher=SAGlobalAffairs.com|accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patton regularly teaches in public venues nationally and internationally on interfaith issues, comparative religion, and religion and conflict.  In 2008–09 she co-hosted a TV series on "Faith and Feminism" for Atlanta Interfaith Broadcasting.  Patton served as Chair of the Department from 2000–07, as Co-convenor of the Religions and the Human Spirit Strategic Plan from 2005–07, and as Winship Distinguished Research Professor from 2003–06. She was the recipient of Emory’s highest award for teaching, the Emory Williams Award, in 2006. She co-convenes the Religion and Conflict Initiative at Emory University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ovguide.com/laurie-l-patton-9202a8c04000641f8000000012e52aaa#&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Maestoso''''' ({{IPA-it|ma.eˈstoːzo}}) is an Italian [[musical term]] and is used to direct performers to play a certain [[passage (music)|passage]] of music in a stately, dignified and majestic fashion (sometimes march-like) or, it is used to describe music as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maestoso|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maestoso|work=Free Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Maestoso'' also is associated with the advent of [[Classical period (music)|Classicism]], [[Romantic music|Romanticism]], and the newer forms of [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neo-Classicism]] and [[Neoromanticism (music)|Neo-Romanticism]]. The interpretation of ''maestoso'' is varied by the conductor depending upon the overall style in which the piece is written. Used as more of an interpretive choice, this term is not always associated with a specific tempo or tempo range.

==Examples==
The term is commonly used in relatively slow pieces, but there are many examples, such as the first movement of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s [[Flute Concerto No. 1 (Mozart)|Flute Concerto No. 1]], in which a faster tempo can be played in such ''maestoso''. Common examples of ''maestoso'' [[tempo]] include [[Elgar]]'s ''[[Land of Hope and Glory]]'', the first [[Movement (music)|movement]] of Mozart's [[Piano Concerto No. 21]], the first [[movement (music)|movement]] of both [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 6 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 6]] and [[Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 9]], as well as [[Chopin]]'s [[Polonaise in A-flat major, Op. 53|Polonaise in A{{music|flat}} major, Op. 53]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definitions/maestoso|title=Maestoso|work=Webster's Online Dictionary|publisher=Webster's|accessdate=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first movement of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]]'s [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Brahms)|First Piano Concerto]] is another example. Beethoven also indicated “Maestoso” in the first movement of his Piano Sonata Op.111 as an introduction of "Allegro". 

''Maestoso'' is also used very often for parts of pieces meant to sound large, triumphant and heroic, like the ''Olympic Fanfare and Theme'' by [[John Williams]]. The first movement of Chopin's [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Chopin)|second concerto]] is marked ''Allegro maestoso''. The first movement of his Liszt's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Liszt)|First Piano Concerto]] is also marked ''Allegro maestoso''. Yet another example of this tempo marking is the opening of the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' by [[Stephen Schwartz (composer)|Steven Schwartz]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">'''Maggot farming''' is the act of growing [[maggot]]s for the industry. It is distinct from [[vermicompost]]ing as there is no separate composting process going on, and maggots are used which are distinct from [[earthworm]]s (they also consume only flesh, not plant-based material).

==Species used==
A variety of species can be used, including the [[black soldier fly]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entologics.com/production.html Entologics growing BSF maggots]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterrafeed.com/process/ Enterrafeed growing BSF maggots]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as various other fly species. Due to convenience, fly species are often used which are indigenous to the area of cultivation.

==Method of cultivation==
When using indigenous fly species, one tactic (employed by the Songhai Center in Benin)&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Economy: 10 years – 100 innovations – 100 million jobs by Gunther Pauli&lt;/ref&gt; is to simply dump [[offal]] or [[Food waste#Animal feed|meat that has exceeded the sell-by date]] in concrete bins. The bins are then covered with [[chicken wire]] to prevent any large animals of being able to feed off it. Then, flies deposit eggs on the offal and meat, and maggots hatch and consume it. After that, the bins are filled with water, so the maggots start to float (separating themselves from any leftovers). The maggots are then harvested and the leftover is discarded or further processed (e.g., bones can be ground to bone meal, ...).

==Use of the maggots==
The maggots are often sold and used as animal feed. Especially [[Aquaculture|fish]], chickens, pig, ducks appreciate them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://time.com/3825158/farming-flies-south-africa/ Black soldier fly farms serving aquaculture and chicken farms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blacksoldierflyfarming.com/faq/bsf-uses Black free soldier fly maggots used as animal feed]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be sold as fishing bait.

The '''Manú Learning Centre''' ('''MLC''') is located within the [[Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]], a 643 hectare private [[nature reserve]], encompassed within the cultural zone of the [[Manú National Park|Manú Biosphere Reserve]], a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage site]] and one of the largest protected areas in [[Peru]]. It is home to a variety of [[tropical rainforest|rainforest types]] including lowland Andean, pre-montane, bamboo and high terrace forests. This geographical complexity creates habitats for a diversity of [[Rainforest#Flora and fauna|flora and fauna]].  The MLC is operated by the [[#CREES|CREES]] group, a non-profit and business collaboration working towards sustainability for the Manú Region.&lt;ref name=UNEP&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.unep-wcmc.org/sites/wh/pdf/Manu.pdf | title = Manu National Park | accessdate = 2009-03-19 | last = UNEP | first = | date = 2008-09-20 | format = PDF | publisher = http://www.unep-wcmc.org | pages = 1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MLC serves local schools and communities as well as international researchers and [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s.  It has hosted workshops for the [[Organization for Tropical Studies]], and on behalf of the Manú National Park Guards, as well as research projects from the [[University of Oxford]], [[Aberdeen University|Aberdeen]], and [[Glasgow University]] in addition to the [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]].  The MLC has also worked alongside schools from the UK including [[Southbank International School]] and [[Tonbridge School]].

==History==
The MLC was built in 2004 on an abandoned [[hacienda]], the first to be developed in the region.  The initial concept was to demonstrate that it was possible to use novel land use techniques to rehabilitate large areas of degraded land and to empower and educate local communities throughout this process.  There is a large body of work that had been completed at the MLC incorporating aspects of [[biology]], [[geography]], [[zoology]], [[anthropology]], [[tropical agriculture]], [[politics]], and [[art]]. Specific projects have focused on [[reforestation]], mammal behaviour patterns, [[ecological footprint|human impact studies]], environmental management, monitoring of the [[blue headed macaw]] ([[CITES|CITES Red listed]]), [[Agricultural soil science#Soil Preservation|soil &amp; agricultural sustainability]], [[forest dynamics]], carbon offsetting, and the legitimacy of local power structures to name a handful.

==CREES==
CREES (Conservation, Research &amp; Education towards Environmental Sustainability) was established in 2003 prior to the construction of the MLC and the creation of Fundo Mascoitania. It is the only organisation to be in operation within the Manú region of Peru who regularly consults with local populations about their development priorities and leads the consequential local development projects.

==Access==
[[Image:Alto Madre from MLC.jpg|thumb|300px|The Alto Madre de Dios River from the Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]The MLC is accessible from [[Cusco]] by road until Atalaya and then by [[Launch(boat)|lancha]] until the port at the MLC.  During the [[dry season]] boats may not be able to navigate the river from Atalaya in which case transport is needed up until the Aguanos settlement on the opposite side of the [[Madre de Dios River|Alto Madre de Dios River]].  Crossing is then possible by raft or by lancha.

==Biodiversity and wildlife==
[[Image:Tropical Tree frog MLC.JPG|thumb|300px|Frog found in Fundo Mascoitania Reserve]]

'''[[Clay lick#Clay licks|Macaw Collpa]]'''

The MLC reserve attracts an array of parrots and macaws thanks to the spectacular clay mineral lick, or [[Clay lick#Clay licks|Collpa]] carved out by the Alto Madre de Dios river. This collpa is the only one of its type in the zone, and is visited daily by hundreds of colourful and noisy parrots and macaws, the most notable of these being the Blue Headed Macaw. These in turn draw raptors such as the ornate hawk eagle and crested eagle.

'''Mammal Collpa'''

The MLC boasts two large mammal collpas which attracts smaller mammals as well as large groups of white-lipped peccary and their natural Jaguar predators.

'''Wildlife Monitoring Array'''

The MLC's wildlife monitoring array was established in 2005. The array comprises a 1&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; monitoring grid mapped using GPS.  It provides a quantified area in which researchers can complete research on plants, animals and birds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6834">The '''Mappae clavicula''' is a medieval Latin text containing manufacturing recipes for crafts materials, including for metals, glass, mosaics, and dyes and tints for materials. The information and style in the recipes is very terse. Each recipe consists of the names of the ingredients and typically about two sentences on combining the ingredients together. A small minority of the recipes go to about six sentences. The text comes with a short preamble, and other than that it is just recipes. The number of recipes was expanded over the course of the medieval centuries, and some medieval copies have deletions as well as additions, so it is better thought of as a family of texts with a largely common core, not a single text. Most of the ''Mappae Clavicula'' recipes are also in medieval Latin in a text known as the ''Compositiones ad Tingenda'' (English: "Recipes for Coloring (or Tingeing)").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2848238 "Notes on Some Manuscripts of the ''Mappae Clavicula''"], by Rozelle P. Johnson, year 1935. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/226251 A Review of ''Compositiones variae'' from Codex 490, Biblioteca Capitolare], by Lynn White, year 1940. [https://books.google.com/books?id=rB3cIVVq-YUC&amp;pg=PA32 ''Books of Secrets in Medieval and Early Modern Culture''], by William Eamon, year 1996, pages 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and accretion ==
The core was probably originally compiled around AD 600, perhaps in [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, in Greek. The core contains items traceable to earlier Alexandrian Greek texts, particularly the [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis|Stockholm papyrus]] and [[Leyden papyrus X|Leiden Papyrus X]], which are Greek texts dated to the 2nd or 3rd century AD that contain some of the same and similar recipes. The first few recipes in the Phillipps-Corning manuscript&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning /&gt; of the ''Mappae clavicula'' were long considered integral, but they form a distinct separate entity,  the ''De coloribus et mixtionibus'', which survives (in whole or in part) in at least 62 manuscripts.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke, M. (2001) ''The Art of All Colours: Mediaeval Recipe Books for Painters and Illuminators''. London: Archetype Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; The core of the Latin ''Mappae clavicula'' is very likely a translation of a Greek text, although the original Greek text (if it existed) does not exist today.

The best manuscripts of the ''Mappae clavicula'' date from the eighth to the twelfth century.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. S. and J. G. Hawthorne (1974) ‘Mappae Clavicula: A Little Key to the World of Medieval Techniques’, ''Transactions of the American Philosophical Society: Held at Philadelphia for promoting useful knowledge'' (new series) 64 (4) [occupies whole issue].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the fullest collections of recipes is in a certain manuscript dated late 12th century in which about 300 recipes are presented. In this manuscript, called the Phillipps-Corning manuscript, some of the names for some materials are Arabic names (e.g. ''alquibriz'' from the Arabic for sulphur, ''atincar'' from the Arabic for borax, ''alcazir'' from the Arabic for tin).&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/archaeologiaormi32sociuoft#page/187/mode/1up ''Mappae clavicula'' from a 12th-century manuscript], text published in Latin by Thomas Phillipps in year 1847. The original manuscript that Thomas Phillipps possessed, dated late 12th century, is now in the hands of the Corning Museum of Glass. Hence it is referred to as "the Phillipps-Corning manuscript". A digital image of it is downloadable at the [http://www.cmog.org/library/manuscript-mappae-clavicula Corning Museum of Glass, MS 5].&lt;/ref&gt; The recipes containing the Arabic names are historically later, and are in all likelihood no earlier than the 12th century. Certain earlier manuscripts have about 200 recipes.

The  principal manuscripts are:
* The ''Lucca MS'', Lucca, Biblioteca Capitolare Feliniana, Codex 490, the oldest witness, c. 800.
* The Sélestat MS, Sélestat, Bibliothèque Humaniste, MS 17. A very full yet old witness, early ninth century.
* The ''Codex Matritensis'' ('Madrid codex'), Madrid, Biblioteca Nacional, MS A.16 (Was: MS A.19), c. 1130.
* The Phillipps-Corning Manuscript, Corning Museum of Glass, MS 5, late twelfth century.&lt;ref name=PhillippsCorning /&gt;

These  are simply among the fullest [[Textual criticism|witnesses]] - there are dozens more that preserve extracts.&lt;ref name=Clarke /&gt;

== Title ==
The title, ''Mappae clavicula'', is absurd, translating approximately as 'the little key to the small cloth'. The best explanation is that it is a mis-translation from a Greek original, in which χειρόκμητον ''kheirókmēton'' ('knack' or 'trick of the trade') was mis-read as χειρόμακτρον ''kheirómaktron'' ('hand-towel').&lt;ref&gt;Robert Halleux, 'Recettes d'artisan, recettes d'alchimiste', in: R. Jansen-Sieben (ed.) ''Artes mechanicae'', Archives et bibliothèques de Belgique, no. spécial 34 (Brussels, 1989), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the observation that certain recipes derive from the Greek technical papyri, the [[Leyden papyrus X]] and the [[Papyrus Graecus Holmiensis|Stockholm papyrus]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5870">[[image:IJsselmeer satellite.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Markerwaard would be on what is now the [[Markermeer]]]]

The '''Markerwaard''' is the name of a proposed [[polder]] in the [[IJsselmeer]] that was never built. The construction of Markerwaard would have resulted in the near-total reclamation of the [[Markermeer]].

[[Cornelis Lely]]'s plan projected a polder in the south-west of the [[Zuiderzee]], originally named ''Hoornsche Polder'', referring to [[Hoorn]], then simply "Southwest Polder".&lt;ref&gt;Ir. J.F.R. van de Wall (1952): 'De groei van het ontwerp voor de Oosterpolder',  ''Ts. v.h. Kon. Ned. Aardr. Gen.'', 69:3, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; Later the name was changed to Markerwaard Polder, after the island of  [[Marken]]. However, reclamation of three other polders took place first, and preparations for the Markerwaard were being made while draining of the northeast and southeast polders (today's [[Flevoland]]) were underway.

In 1941 work for this project started; about 2&amp;nbsp;km of a dike north of [[Marken]] was built. It would have had an area of nearly 600&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. But the German occupation stopped the project. Later, it was decided that the [[Flevopolder]] should have priority. In 1957, the island of Marken was connected to mainland Holland. In 1976 the dam [[Houtribdijk]] connecting [[Enkhuizen]] and [[Lelystad]] was completed, a necessary step in the construction of Markerwaard, the dikes for the bordering lakes were still to be completed.  However the entire project became mired in political and environmental controversy.  In the late 1970s, the project was revised down leaving wide [[bordering lakes]] between the polder and [[North Holland]]. [[Marken]] would remain a peninsula, unlike on the original project. At this stage, the Markerwaard would have had an area of 410&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

{{asof|1961}} Markerwaard was expected to be finished in 1978.&lt;ref name="ley196110"&gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate on a final decision regarding it took over twenty years. The questions concerned the need, on one side, for more agricultural areas, new residential subdivisions, and a new airport (to relieve pressure on [[Schiphol Airport|Schiphol]]). On the other side of the debate were primarily ecological issues, with the argument that the value of the lake as a recreation area was considered by some to be stronger than the potential benefits of the polder. Additionally, it was argued that, in case of drought, the lake would be very useful for the production of drinking water, and that in heavy weather, the lake serves as a buffer zone.

Finally, in 2003, it was decided not to build this polder.&lt;ref&gt;In de '''Nota Ruimte''' ''Ruimte voor ontwikkeling'', Deel 4 ''Definitieve versie'', Hoofdstuk 4 ''Gebieden en thema's'', Paragraaf 6 ''IJsselmeergebied'', Sub-paragraaf 4 ''Specifieke beleidskeuzen'', Kop 3 ''Buitendijkse ontwikkelingen'' staat op pag. 156: "De ruimtelijke reservering voor een Markerwaard vervalt."

In 2012, plans emerged to create the [[Marker Wadden]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2013-10683.html Intentieverklaring Marker Wadden, Rijkswaterstaat], Dutch government bulletin, April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; a group of islands designed to establish nature reserves in the north of the Markermeer. In contrast to the Markerwaard, no human occupation is planned. The creation process began in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandandgravel.com/news/article.asp?v1=20056 Boskalis wins Marker Wadden Island contract], Dredging News Online, 15 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8925">'''Market for Loyalties Theory''' is a [[media theory]] based upon [[neoclassical economics]]. It describes why governments and power-holders monopolize radio, satellite, internet and other media through [[censorship]] using regulations, technology and other controls. It has also been used to theorize about what happens when there is a loss of [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]].

==History and elements of the theory==
The theory was originally developed in the 1990s by [[Monroe Price]],&lt;ref&gt;Monroe E. Price, ''Television: The Public Sphere and National Identity'' 67 (1995); Monroe E. Price, ''Law, Force and the Russian Media'', 13 Cardozo Arts &amp; Ent. L.J. 795 (1995); Monroe E. Price, ''The Market for Loyalties and the Uses of Comparative Media Law'', in ''Broadcasting Reform in India: Media Law from A Global Perspective'' 93 (Monroe E. Price &amp; Stefaan G. Verhulst Eds., 1998); Monroe E. Price, ''Media and Sovereignty: The Global Information Revolution and its Challenge to State Power'' 32 (2002); Monroe E. Price, ''The Market for Loyalties: Electronic Media and the Global Competition for Allegiances'', 104 Yale L.J. 667 (1994); Monroe E. Price, ''The Market for Loyalties and the Uses of "Comparative Media Law"'', 5 Cardozo J. Int’l &amp; Comp. L. 445 (1997); Monroe E. Price, ''The Newness of New Technologies'', 22 Cardozo L. Rev. 1885 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; professor of law at [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law|Cardozo Law]] School and professor of communication studies at the [[Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania]]. His theory explains media regulation in terms of a market with an exchange, not of cash for goods or services, but identity for loyalty.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Price describes sellers as: "Sellers in the market are all those for whom myths and dreams and history [i.e,. identity] can somehow be converted into power and wealth—classically states, governments, [[interest group]]s, business and others."&lt;ref&gt;Monroe E. Price, ''Market for Loyalties:  Electronic Media and the Global Competition for Allegiances'', 104 Yale L.J., at 669.&lt;/ref&gt; Price illustrates buyers, [[medium of exchange]], and their relationship:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The "buyers" are citizens, subjects, nationals, consumers—recipients of packages of information, propaganda, advertisements, drama, and news propounded by the media. The consumer "pays" for one set of identities or another in several ways that, together, we call "loyalty" or "citizenship."

Payment, however, is not expressed in the ordinary coin of the realm:  It includes not only compliance with tax obligations, but also obedience to laws, readiness to fight in [[Armed forces|armed services]], or even continued residence within a country.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', at 669-70.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Finally, the concept of identity consists of a [[party platform]], ideology, or national ideals and aspirations. It may be as ephemeral as the hope for a better future or as concrete as the desire for a national homeland. Identity is valuable to buyers as it contains both the legacy of their past history and the promise of their dreams for the future (whether it is for wealth, a better life, or an education).

The central idea is that governments and power-holders act in such a way as to preserve their control over the market. The theory was applied with respect to markets offering identity through various media—radio and [[Satellite television|satellite broadcasting]] and the internet.

==Market for loyalties and monopolies==
When a [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]] over the flow of information is lost, the unavoidable consequence is destabilization. Market for Loyalties Theory predicts the consequences of loss of control through the application of the concept of [[Elasticity (economics)|elasticity]]. 

All other factors being equal, the less elasticity in the market prior to the loss of [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]], the greater the destabilizing effect of the loss of such control. 
:Four factors affect elasticity: the number of substitute products (or identities) in the market and their closeness to the good in question; effects from marginal consumers; complications from wholesale and retail marketing; and the temporal, informational, and transaction costs necessary for consumers to learn about and take advantage of competing products.&lt;ref&gt;Paul D. Callister, [http://works.bepress.com/paul_callister/3/ ''Identity and Market for Loyalties Theories: The Case for Free Information Flow in Insurgent Iraq''], 25 St.Louis U.Pub.L.Rev. 124, 136 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
[http://www1.law.umkc.edu/faculty/callister/pubs/wikipedia/marketforloyalties/inelasticdemand.2.png" Link to graphical illustration of inelasticity.]

[[Substitute good]]s consist of two items where "a rise in the price of one causes an increase in demand for the other."&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A.L. Auld et al., American Dictionary of Economics 306 (1983) (under entry for ''Substitutes'').&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, Marco Fanno, an Italian economist, demonstrated that elasticity (and more importantly, stability) increase with additional substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Marco Fanno, ''The Elasticity of Demand of Substitute Goods'', 3 Italian Econ. Papers 99, 115 (1998). This article is a translation of an article originally published in German as: Marco Fanno, ''Die Elastizität der Nachfrage nach Ersatzgütern'', in Zeitscrift fϋr Nationalökonomie 51 (1930). The German article was meant to be a synthesis of a much longer Fanno essay that was earlier published in Italian: Marco Fanno, ''Contributo alla Teoria Economica dei Beni Succedanei'', in 2 Annali di Economia 331 (1925-26).&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the Market for Loyalties, the more substitutes for "identity", and be implication the more competition of "identity" in the instance of oligopoly, the more elastic the demand curve and the less destabilizing a loss of [[monopoly]] or [[oligopoly]] over an information environment will have. Furthermore, as the number of competing messages of identity in the Market for Loyalties approaches infinity, the presence of any new message of identity should have infinitesimal effect. Thus, when the concept of elasticity is applied to Market for Loyalties Theory, it creates an argument supporting the broadest possible freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Callister ''supra'', note 4, at 153; Paul D. Callister, [http://works.bepress.com/paul_callister/6/ ''The Internet, Regulation and the Market for Loyalties: An Economic Analysis of Transborder Information Flow''], 2002 Journal of Law, Technology and Policy 59,90-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

A complete understanding of the economics underlying the loss of monopoly control over the market requires consideration of other factors of elasticity besides substitute goods.  Additional consumers of identity, who were sidelined during prior periods of oligopoly.  For instance Shi'a were marginalized in Iraq from fully participating in society during Saddam Husein's regime, and the Shi'a presence after the fall of the regime would increase demand in the Market for Loyalties.&lt;ref&gt;See Callister ''supra'' note 4 at 139-40.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Another important factor affecting elasticity in the Market for Loyalties and stability after loss of monopolized control is the presence of retail and wholesale markets. In Iraq the significance of tribalism, whereby loyalty could be sold "wholesale" had the effect of locking in the choices of individuals to their particular tribe.  They simply were not free to choose their allegiances. The ultimate effect was to increase the inelasticity of the demand curve, thereby increasing the instability after the Market for Loyalties became more open following the removal of Saddam Husein's regime (the principal [[Censorship|censor]] of information in the market).&lt;ref&gt;See ''id. supra'' note 4 at 140-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

High transaction costs (the cost of switching loyalty) also can work to create a steep demand curve and instability following monopoly control. The cost of shifting identity with and loyalty to various tribes, political organizations, and religions can be quite high—resulting in a loss of family, friends and social standing and even trigger persecution. In an intolerant society, the high transaction costs of shifting one's identity and loyalty also operate to produce an inelastic demand curve and instability upon opening of a Market for Loyalties that had been previously constricted by monopoly or oligopoly.&lt;ref&gt;See ''id. supra'' note 4 at 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[linguistics]], the '''minimalist program''' ('''MP''') is a major line of inquiry that has been developing inside [[generative grammar]] since the early 1990s, starting with a 1993 paper by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam. 1993. ''A minimalist program for linguistic theory''. MIT occasional papers in linguistics no. 1. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Distributed by MIT Working Papers in Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chomsky presents MP as a [[research program|program]], not as a theory, following [[Imre Lakatos]]'s distinction.&lt;ref&gt;For a thorough discussion of this distinction in the context of linguistics, see Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism: Origins, Concepts, Methods, and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The MP seeks to be a mode of inquiry characterized by the flexibility of the multiple directions that its minimalism enables. Ultimately, the MP provides a conceptual framework used to guide the development of linguistic theory. In minimalism, [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]] attempts to approach [[universal grammar]] from below—that is, proposing the question "what would be the optimal answer to what the theory of [[i-Language]] should be?"

For Chomsky, there are [[Minimalist grammar|minimalist]] questions, but the answers can be framed in any theory. Of all these questions, the two that play the most crucial role are:&lt;ref&gt;Boeckx, Cedric ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims'', pp. 84 and 115.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*What is language?
*Why does it have the properties it has?

== Theoretical goals ==

=== Perfection ===

The MP appeals to the idea that the language ability in humans shows signs of being incorporated under an optimal design with exquisite organization, which seems to suggest that the inner workings conform to a very simple computational law or a particular mental organ. In other words, the MP works on the assumption that [[universal grammar]] constitutes a perfect design in the sense that it contains only what is necessary to meet humans' conceptual and physical (phonological) needs.&lt;ref&gt;Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

From a theoretical standpoint, and in the context of [[generative grammar]], the MP draws on the minimalist approach of the [[principles and parameters]] program, considered to be the ultimate standard theoretical model that generative linguistics has developed since the 1980s. What this approach suggests is the existence of a fixed set of principles valid for all languages, which, when combined with settings for a finite set of binary switches (parameters), may describe the specific properties that characterize the language system a child eventually comes to attain.&lt;ref&gt;There are many introductions to Principle and Parameters. Two that align PP in such a way that make the transition to MP smooth are Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Malden, MA: Blackwell, and Cook, Vivian J. and Newson, Mark. 2007. ''Chomsky's Universal Grammar: An Introduction''. Third Edition. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;

The MP aims to get to know how much of the [[principles and parameters]] model can be taken as a result of this hypothetical optimal and computationally efficient design of the human language faculty. In turn, more developed versions of the [[Principles and Parameters]] approach provide technical principles from which the MP can be seen to follow.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed introductory discussion between the transition of the technicalities from PP to MP see, among others, Gert Webelhuth. 1995. ''Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program: Principles and Parameters in Syntactic Theory''. Wiley-Blackwell; Uriagereka, Juan. 1998. ''Rhyme and Reason. An Introduction to Minimalist Syntax''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT Press]]; Hornstein, Norbert, Jairo Nunes and Kleanthes K. Grohmann. 2005. ''Understanding Minimalism''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; and Boeckx, Cedric. 2006. ''Linguistic Minimalism. Origins, Concepts, Methods and Aims''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economy ===

The MP aims at the further development of ideas involving ''economy of derivation'' and ''economy of representation'', which had started to become significant in the early 1990s, but were still peripheral aspects of [[transformational grammar]].&lt;ref&gt;For a full description of the checking mechanism see Adger, David. 2003. ''Core Syntax. A Minimalist Approach''. Oxford: Oxford University Press; and also Carnie, Andrew. 2006. ''Syntax: A Generative Introduction'', 2nd Edition. Blackwell Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;
* Economy of derivation is a principle stating that movements (i.e., transformations) only occur in order to match ''interpretable features'' with ''uninterpretable features''. An example of an interpretable feature is the plural [[inflection]] on regular English nouns, e.g., ''dog'''s'''''. The word ''dogs'' can only be used to refer to several dogs, not a single dog, and so this inflection contributes to meaning, making it ''interpretable''. English verbs are inflected according to the [[grammatical number|number]] of their subject (e.g., "Dogs bite" vs. "A dog bite'''''s'''''"), but this information is only interpretable once a relationship is formed between the subject and the verb, so movement of the subject is required.
* Economy of representation is the principle that grammatical structures must exist for a purpose, i.e., the structure of a sentence should be no larger or more complex than required to satisfy constraints on grammaticality, which are equivalent to constraints on the mapping between the conceptual/intentional and sensori-motor interfaces in the optimal system that minimalism seeks to explore.

== Technical innovations ==

The exploration of minimalist questions has led to several radical changes in the technical apparatus of transformational generative grammatical theory. Some of the most important are:&lt;ref&gt;For some conceptual and empirical advantages of the MP over the traditional view see: Bošković, Željko. 1994. D-Structure, Θ-Criterion, and Movement into Θ-Positions. Linguistic Analysis 24: 247–286, and for more detailed discussions Bošković, Željko and Howard Lasnik (eds). 2006. ''Minimalist Syntax: The Essential Readings''. Malden, MA: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The generalization of [[X-bar theory]] into bare phrase structure (see below).
* The simplification of representational levels in the grammatical model, eliminating the distinction between [[deep structure and surface structure]] in favor of a more explicitly derivational approach.
* The elimination of the notion of [[Government (linguistics)|government]].
* The inclusion of a two new points of interaction, namely, a "spell-out" point between syntax and the interface with the phonological form, and an additional point of interaction with the logical form.
* The idea that syntactic derivations proceed by clearly delineated stages called "phases" (see below).

=== Bare phrase structure ===

A major development of MP inquiry is bare phrase structure (BPS), a theory of [[Phrase structure rules|phrase structure]] (sentence building prior to movement) developed by [[Noam Chomsky]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chomsky, Noam. 1995. Bare Phrase Structure. In ''Evolution and Revolution in Linguistic Theory. Essays in honor of Carlos Otero''., eds. Hector Campos and Paula Kempchinsky, 51–109.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of BPS has moved the Chomskyan tradition toward the [[dependency grammar]] tradition, which operates with significantly less structure than most [[phrase structure grammar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Timothy, Michael Putnam, and Thomas Gross 2011. Bare phrase structure, label-less structures, and specifier-less syntax: Is Minimalism becoming a dependency grammar? The Linguistic Review 28: 315–364&lt;/ref&gt;

This theory contrasts with [[X-bar theory]], which preceded it, in four important ways:

# BPS is explicitly derivational. That is, it is built from the bottom up, bit by bit. In contrast, X-bar theory is representational—a structure for a given construction is built in one fell swoop, and [[lexical items]] are inserted into the structure.
# BPS does not have a preconceived phrasal structure, while in X-bar theory every phrase has a [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]], a [[head (linguistics)|head]], and a [[complement (linguistics)|complement]].
# BPS permits only binary branching, while X-bar theory permits both binary and unary branching.
# BPS does not distinguish between a "head" and a "terminal", while some versions of X-bar theory require such a distinction.

BPS incorporates two basic operations: "[[Merge (linguistics)|merge]]" and "[[Move α|move]]". Although there is active debate on exactly how "move" should be formulated, the differences between the current proposals are relatively minute. The following description follows Chomsky's original proposal.&lt;!--so where is the discussion of move, then? The rest of this section only describes merge. Is move unimportant, or has it been forgotten?--&gt;

Merge is a function that takes two objects (say α and β) and merges them into an unordered set with a label (either α or β, in this case α). The label identifies the properties of the phrase.

Merge (α, β) → {α, {α, β} }

For example, "merge" can operate on the lexical items "drink" and "water" to give "drink water". Note that the phrase "drink water" behaves more like the [[verb]] ''drink'' than like the [[noun]] ''water''. That is, wherever the verb ''drink'' can be put, so too can the phrase "drink water":

I like to _____________ (drink)/(drink water).&lt;br&gt;
(Drinking/Drinking water) __________ is fun.

Furthermore, the phrase "drink water" can not typically be put in the same places as the noun ''water'':

It can be said, "There's some ''water'' on the table", but not "There's some ''drink water'' on the table".

So, the phrase is identified with a label. In the case of "drink water", the label is ''drink'' since the phrase acts as a verb. For simplicity, this phrase is called a verb phrase (VP). If "cold" and "water" were merged to get "cold water", this would be a noun phrase (NP) with the label "water"; it follows that the phrase "cold water" can appear in the same environments as the noun ''water'' in the three test sentences above. So, for ''drink water'', there is the following:

Merge (drink, water) → {drink, {drink, water} }

This can be represented in a typical [[concrete syntax tree|syntax tree]] as follows:

[[Image:Minimalist Tree Drink Water.png|150px]]

or, with more technical terms, as:

[[Image:Minimalist Tree VP.png|150px]]

Merge can also operate on structures already built. If it could not, then such a system would predict only two-word utterances to be grammatical. If a new head is merged with a previously formed object (a phrase), the function has the form

Merge &lt;code&gt;(γ, {α, {α, β}}) → {γ, {γ, {α, {α, β}}}}&lt;/code&gt;

Here, γ is the label, so that γ "projects" from the label of the head. This corresponds to the following tree structure:

[[Image:Minimalist Syntax Tree 1.png|150px]]

Merge operates blindly, projecting labels in all possible combinations. The [[subcategorization]] features of the head then license certain label projections and eliminate all derivations with alternate projections.

=== Phases ===
A "'''phase'''" is a syntactic domain first hypothesized by [[Noam Chomsky]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam (1998). "Minimalist Inquiries: The Framework" MIT Occasional Papers in Linguistics 15. Republished in 2000 in R. Martin, D. Michaels, &amp; J. Uriagereka (eds.). ''Step By Step: Essays In Syntax in Honor of [[Howard Lasnik]]''. 89–155. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A simple sentence is often decomposed into two phases, CP and ''v''P (see [[X-bar theory]]). Movement of a constituent out of a phase is (in the general case) only permitted if the constituent has first moved to the left edge of the phase. This condition is described in the ''phase impenetrability condition'', which has been variously formulated within the literature. In its original conception, only the ''v''P in transitive and [[unergative verb]]s constitute phases. The ''v''P in passives and [[unaccusative verb]]s (if even present) are not phases. This topic is, however, currently under debate in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;See, among others, Legate, Julie Anne. 2003. Some Interface Properties of the phrase. Linguistic Inquiry 34: 506–516 and Chomsky, Noam. 2008. On Phases. In ''Foundational Issues in Linguistic Theory. Essays in Honor of Jean-Roger Vergnaud''. eds. Robert Freidin, Carlos Peregrín Otero and Maria Luisa Zubizarreta, 133–166. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
In the late 1990s, [[David E. Johnson]] and Shalom Lappin published the first detailed critiques of Chomsky's minimalist program.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, David E. and Shalom Lappin (1997), "A Critique of the Minimalist Program" in ''Linguistics and Philosophy'' 20, 273–333, and Johnson, David E. and Shalom Lappin (1999). ''Local Constraints vs Economy.'' Stanford: CSLI&lt;/ref&gt; This technical work was followed by a lively debate with proponents of minimalism on the scientific status of the program.&lt;ref&gt;*Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2000a). "The Structure of Unscientific Revolutions." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 18, 665–771&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E. Johnson (2000b). "The Revolution Confused: A Reply to our Critics." ''[[Natural Language and Linguistic Theory]]'' 18, 873–890&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lappin, Shalom, Robert Levine and David E.

Lappin et al. argue that the minimalist program is a radical departure from earlier Chomskyan linguistic practice that is not motivated by any new empirical discoveries, but rather by a general appeal to ''perfection'', which is both empirically unmotivated and so vague as to be unfalsifiable. They compare the adoption of this paradigm by linguistic researchers to other historical paradigm shifts in natural sciences and conclude that of the minimalist program has been an "unscientific revolution", driven primarily by Chomsky's authority in linguistics. The several replies to the article in ''Natural Language and Linguistic Theory'' Volume 18 number 4 (2000) make a number of different defenses of the minimalist program. Some claim that it is not in fact revolutionary or not in fact widely adopted, while others agree with Lappin and Johnson on these points, but defend the vagueness of its formulation as not problematic in light of its status as a research program rather than a theory (see above).

'''#NEWPALMYRA''' (Also known as the '''New Palmyra Project''') is an effort to reconstruct the ancient city of [[Palmyra]] as an immersive virtual environment, based on archaeological and other clues.  The project was started from photos [[Bassel Khartabil]] had been taking of Palmyra since 2005.  He began building models of the ancient city, with support from [[Al Aous Publishers]].   
In 2012, Khartabil was arrested, and the original project and open source files were lost.  Barry Threw took over as director of the project, renamed #NEWPALMYRA, and a community of developers, modelers, and archaeologists began collaborating to model, restore, and later recreate from scratch those historical structures captured on film and camera.

In 2015, ISIL captured Palmyra and began destroying some of its famous historical sites. In late 2015, the [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]] began contributing to the New Palmyra Project, sending archaeologists with cheap 3D cameras to capture any  further structures that ISIL might decide to destroy.

; Arch of Triumph&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/arch-of-triumph/|title=Arch of Triumph|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arch-of-triumph-3D-print.stl|thumb|right|100px|Arch of Triumph as a 3D model]]
One of the best known structures in Palmyra was the monumental Arch of Triumph (قوس النصر). Constructed during the reign of Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (193 to 211), it was sometimes mistakenly referred to as [[Hadrian]]’s arch. It was restored in the 1930s, and then destroyed completely during the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2015.

Palmyra's main streets were not at right angles, and this arch was famously built at a 30-degree turn in the colonnade between the tetrapylon (التترابيل) and the Temple of Bel (معبد بل), with two richly carved façades angled away from one another.

; Tetrapylon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/tetrapylon/|title=Tetrapylon|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tetrapylon-3D-Print.jpg|thumb|right|100px|A 3D-printed version of the Tetrapylon on display at [[Wikimania 2017]]]]
A square platform, each corner containing a group of four columns. This was erected during the renovations of Diocletian at the end of the 3rd century. Each column had a pedestal in its center that originally supported a statue. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite.  Only one was undamaged in 1963 when the whole was restored with concrete. Destroyed again by [[ISIL]] on January 20, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2016/1210/ISIS-recaptures-Palmyra-A-fresh-assault-on-heritage-sites-video|title=ISIS recaptures Palmyra: A fresh assault on heritage sites?

[[Image:Bassel-bel-3.jpg|thumb|alt=Temple of Bel rendering|Temple of Bel rendering.|100x100px]]This ancient temple was dedicated to the Mesopotamian god Bel in 32 AD.  Bel was worshipped at Palmyra along with the moon god Aglibol and the sun god Yarhibol.  The ruins of the temple were among the best preserved at Palmyra.  they were destroyed by ISIL in August, 2015.

; Roman theater&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/theater/|title=Roman Theater|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Roman Theatre at Palmyra (المسرح الروماني بتدمر) dates to the time of Severus. Its remains were restored in the 20th century, and it served for a time as a venue for the annual Palmyra festival.  It was destroyed by ISIL in May 2015.

; Temple of Baal Shamin&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/temple-of-baal-shamin/|title=Temple of Baal Shamin|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Temple of Baal Shamin dates to the 2nd century BC, and dedicated to the Canaanite sky deity. Its altar was built in 115 AD, and the temple was rebuilt in 131 AD. In the 5th century AD, it was converted to a church.  In 2015 it was destroyed by ISIL.

; Assad al-Lat statue&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/asad-al-lat/|title=Asad Al-Lat|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Asad Al-Lat.stl|thumb|right|100px|The [[Assad al-Lat statue]] 3D model]]
This was the first statue modeled by #rsssd (Re-Sculpting Syrian Statues Digitally).  In 2015 it was destroyed by ISIL.

== Reconstructions and exhibits ==
A 12-ton lifesize replica of part of the Arch of Triumph was carved into stone, from these models, and installed in London's Trafalgar Square in 2016.

A number of small artefacts were reconstructed and displayed at the 2016 Venice Architecture Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/events/venice-biennale/|title=Venice Biennale|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2826">In Canada, an '''official community plan''' is a comprehensive plan created by an incorporated [[municipality]] which dictates public policy in terms of transportation, utilities, land use, recreation, and housing. OCPs typically encompass large geographical areas, a broad range of topics, and cover a long-term time horizon. The process of creating an OCP is today often referred to as a Community Vision.

In the United States such a plan is known as a [[Comprehensive planning|comprehensive plan]].

In some large jurisdictions and metropolitan areas experiencing significant growth, regional [[Transportation planning|transportation plans]] are made that work in conjunction with municipal OCPS.

Official community plans is the formal term for documents created by an incorporated municipality and filed with the provincial government, usually the Ministry of Municipal Affairs.

OCPs have to be periodically updated to remain relevant. For example, the City of North Vancouver created an Official Community Plan in 1980, 1992, and again in 2002. When objectives of the plan have been achieved new objectives are set. For example, the [[North Vancouver, British Columbia (city)|City of North Vancouver]] in Metro Vancouver states as its achievements the construction of 5,000 units of housing in the city center, commercial and institutional development, a balanced mix of transportation modes, modern telecommunications infrastructure, a high percentage of multifamily housing, an accessible waterfront, and a balance between jobs and labour force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnv.org/c//DATA/2/107/~CHAPTER%2002%20INTRODUCTION%20TO%20THE%20OCP.PDF City of North Vancouver Official Community Plan 2002, Historical overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

Community planning may also be done on a smaller scale. The resulting plan is not an official community plan but is known as a [[Neighborhood Planning|neighborhood plan]]. In Vancouver such Neighborhood Plans are also known as ''community visions''. The primary motive for these neighborhood plans in Vancouver was to find ways to accommodate more housing (or new housing choices) in existing neighborhoods in a way sensitive and responsive to the concerns of existing residents. The official statement being more vague:&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.ca/commsvcs/planning/cityplan/Visions/dunbar/vision.htm Report outlining the neighborhood planning process for Dunbar neighborhood in Vancouver]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"THAT Council and Departments use the ... Community vision directions to
help guide policy decisions, corporate work, priorities, budgets and capital plans in
this community."

==Design==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] from design company John Doe designed Olli from the basic shape of a [[soccer ball]]. They believe the basic shape, size and character was part of Olli's success. This made Olli easily recognizable to audiences. Olli is drawn in a minimalist style, requiring only a few lines and one [[primary color]]. Olli was created in three sizes, one small size 4.7 in. one medium, size 11 in. and one big size 7.2&amp;nbsp;ft.

==Big Olli==
There are two big Olli's. They are the elder version of small Olli. The Big Olli's is a special creature model made for several charities. One is a permanent hard [[plastic]] [[polyester]] [[statue]] at the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children's Hospital]] and another one has a temporarily place at the [[Rotterdam Zoo]]. The big Olli that is used in the short film to save the Rotterdam ZOO is stored at a secret location according to the creators.

==Fictional character biography==
Olli is toy elephant grown to the size of a real elephant. Olli is a lovable character with furry friends living in a [[Japan]]ese [[fantasy]] world. Later in 2013 there was a story added that he was also the favorite toy of Famous Soccer player [[Giovanni van Bronckhorst]]. Together they are the main cast of a short film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fr12.nl/dump/9360-olli--amp--giovanni-van-bronckhorst.html
|title=Olli &amp; Giovanni van Bronckhorst|publisher=FR12|language=Dutch|date=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Rotterdam, [[Netherlands]] of 1980, Giovanni van Bronckhorst is a little boy (played in the short film by the son of Giovanni van Bronckhorst). One day, he discovers a stuffed Elephant at the Rotterdam [[Zoo]] and immediately grows attached to it. The name of the elephant is Olli. Giovanni takes him everywhere he goes, especially when he plays soccer. One day during a soccer game, he loses Olli in the canal of Rotterdam. 28 years later in 2013, Giovanni became a Famous Soccer Player and trainer of soccer club [[Feyenoord]] and Olli, also grew big, reunite again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://christianneblogs.com/2013/03/21/olli-een-aaibare-briljante-reclame

==Background==
[[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] have a history in creating things that help people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fabmagazine.nl/2014/03/wereldheerschappij-voor-rotterdamse-olli|title=Wereldheerschappij voor Rotterdamse Olli|publisher=FAB|language=Dutch|date=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; To give something back to society and convince big brands to do so too. Olli was a few times part of a strategy they developed in 2004 and created Olli as a separate brand to generate [[awareness]] and in one campaign to generate more traffic and money for a [[ZOO]] in [[Rotterdam]].

In one year over 200.000 Olli's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.ad.nl/ad/nl/1038/Rotterdam/article/detail/3555615/2013/12/03/Knuffelolifantje-Olli-reddende-engel-diergaarde-Blijdorp.dhtml
|title=Olli reddende engel diergaarde Blijdorp|publisher=Algemeen Dagblad|language=Dutch|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; were sold. Olli also generated 75.000 more visitors for the Rotterdam zoo. Ollimania is a [[licensing]]

==Charity==
Ollimania is always involved with giving back to the community.  Ollimania works with local charity organizations as well as collaborating on common projects, fund‐raisings and social activities. In 2013 Ollimania saved a historic Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BG_7Lm-CIAE1Fj7.jpg:large|title=Olli de vredesduif|publisher=AD|date= March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 Ollimania brings its stuffed toy characters to children hospitals, where he interact with little patients by distributing Ollimania presents, reading out Ollimania stories, taking pictures and even organizing birthday celebrations for the most needing ones and their families. On September 10, 2015, Ollimania and its creators [[Hein Mevissen]] and [[Diederiekje Bok]] donated &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rijnmond.nl/nieuws/10-09-2015/sophia-kinderziekenhuis-verwelkomt-olli-de-olifant|title=Sophia Kinderziekenhuis verwelkomt Olli de olifant|publisher=RTV Rijnmond|language=Dutch|date=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a huge Olli [[statue]] to the Sophia [[Children's hospital|Children’s Hospital]] in [[Rotterdam]].

== copyright infringement ==
In 2015 John Doe BV/Ollimania started a lawsuit against the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] insurance company [[ASR Nederland]] for copyright infringement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=John Doe BV Olli|publisher=IE Forum |date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch [[Insurance]] company used illegally images and foto’s from Ollimania to sell insurances to their customers. The Dutch court ruled in favor of John Doe BV/ Ollimania and urged ASR Nederland to stop their [[copyright infringement]].
[[ASR Nederland]] had a license for a year on one of the Olli toys that expired in August 2014. The insurance company also kept 30.000 toys that were meant for the Rotterdam zoo to earn [[money]] to keep the [[ZOO]] open. [[ASR Nederland]] was entitled to keep the toys and distribute them however they see fit as long they would not infringe the copyrights of John Doe BV and Olli again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.ie-forum.nl/?//ASR+mag+Olli-producten+na+afloop+licentieovereenkomst+blijven+uitleveren////34043/|title=ASR en Olli|publisher=Reclameboek|date= 30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ASR Nederland is the biggest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.slimmeropweg.nl/het-nieuwe-werken-stappenplan/gerelateerd-nieuws/item/asr-het-nieuwe-generatie-werken|title=Het nieuwe werken|publisher=Slimmer op weg|date=13 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; insurance company of the Netherlands with almost 3000 [[employees]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to the humanities:

'''[[Humanities]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] that study the [[human condition]], using methods that are primarily [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]], [[Critical theory|critical]], or [[speculative philosophy|speculative]], as distinguished from the mainly [[empirical]] approaches of the [[Science|natural sciences]].

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What types of thing are the humanities? ==

The humanities can be described as all of the following:
* a branch of [[List of academic disciplines|academic disciplines]] &amp;ndash; an academic discipline is a field of knowledge that is taught and researched at the college or university level. Disciplines are defined (in part), and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong.
* study of the [[human condition]] &amp;ndash; unique and inescapable features of being human in a social, cultural, and personal context. The study of the humanities (history, philosophy, literature, the arts, etc.) all help understand the nature of the human condition and the broader cultural and social arrangements that make up human lives.

== The various humanities ==

* [[Classics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of classical studies|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the languages, literature, philosophy, history, art, archaeology and all other cultural elements of the ancient Mediterranean world (Bronze Age ca. BC 3000 to Late Antiquity ca. AD 300–600); especially Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.
** [[Digital classics]] &amp;ndash; application of the tools of digital humanities to the field of classics, or more broadly to the study of the ancient world.
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
** [[Digital history]] &amp;ndash;  use of digital media and tools for historical practice, presentation, analysis, and research. It is a branch of the Digital Humanities and an outgrowth of Quantitative history, Cliometrics, and History and Computing.
* [[Language]]s &amp;ndash; study of individual languages ([[Italian language]], [[Japanese language]]) or groups of related languages ([[Romance languages]], [[Slavic languages]]). Not to be confused with [[Linguistics]], the study of the structure and function of language.
* [[Literature]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of literature|outline]]) &amp;ndash; the art of written work, and is not confined to published sources (although, under some circumstances, unpublished sources can also be exempt).
** [[Comparative literature]] &amp;nbsp; comparative research into literature from more than one language, working with the original languages in which the texts were written
* [[Philosophy]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of philosophy|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of general and fundamental problems, such as those connected with [[Ontology|existence]], [[Epistemology|knowledge]], [[Axiology|values]], reason, [[Philosophy of mind|mind]], and language.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Teichmann and Katherine C. Evans, ''Philosophy: A Beginner's Guide'' (Blackwell Publishing, 1999), p. 1: "Philosophy is a study of problems which are ultimate, abstract and very general. These problems are concerned with the nature of existence, knowledge, morality, reason and human purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A.C. Grayling]], ''Philosophy 1: A Guide through the Subject'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 1: "The aim of philosophical inquiry is to gain insight into questions about knowledge, truth, reason, reality, meaning, mind, and value."&lt;/ref&gt;  Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on [[reason|rational argument]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Quinton, in T. Honderich (ed.), ''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 666: "Philosophy is rationally critical thinking, of a more or less [[:wikt:systematic|systematic]] kind about the general nature of the world (metaphysics or theory of existence), the justification of belief (epistemology or theory of knowledge), and the conduct of life (ethics or theory of value). Each of the three elements in this list has a non-philosophical counterpart, from which it is distinguished by its explicitly rational and critical way of proceeding and by its systematic nature. Everyone has some general conception of the nature of the world in which they live and of their place in it. Metaphysics replaces the unargued assumptions embodied in such a conception with a rational and organized body of beliefs about the world as a whole. Everyone has occasion to doubt and question beliefs, their own or those of others, with more or less success and without any theory of what they are doing. Epistemology seeks by argument to make explicit the rules of correct belief formation. Everyone governs their conduct by directing it to desired or valued ends. Ethics, or moral philosophy, in its most inclusive sense, seeks to articulate, in rationally systematic form, the rules or principles involved."&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Religion]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of religion|outline]]) &amp;ndash; a religion is a collection of [[cultural systems]], [[belief systems]], and [[worldviews]] that establishes symbols that relate humanity to [[spirituality]] and, sometimes,&lt;!--not all religions concern themselves with morality--&gt; to moral values.&lt;ref&gt;While religion is difficult to define, one standard model of religion, used in [[religious studies]] courses, was proposed by [[Clifford Geertz]], who simply called it a "cultural system" (Clifford Geertz, ''Religion as a Cultural System'', 1973). A critique of Geertz's model by [[Talal Asad]] categorized religion as "an [[anthropology|anthropological]] category." (Talal Asad, ''The Construction of Religion as an Anthropological Category'', 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Many religions have [[mythology|narratives]], [[symbol]]s, [[tradition]]s and sacred histories that are intended to give [[Meaning of life|meaning to life]] or to explain the [[origin of life]] or the [[universe]]. They tend to derive [[Moral code|morality]], [[ethics]], [[religious law]]s or a preferred [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] from their ideas about the [[cosmos]] and [[human nature]].
* [[Visual arts]] ([[Outline of the visual arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art forms that create works which are primarily visual in nature. Examples of visual arts include:
** [[Architecture]] ([[Outline of architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; The art and science of designing and erecting buildings and other physical structures.
*** [[Classical architecture]] ([[Outline of classical architecture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; architecture of classical antiquity and later architectural styles influenced by it.
** [[Handicraft|Arts and crafts]] ([[Outline of crafts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; recreational activities and hobbies that involve making things with one's hands and skill.
** [[Drawing]] ([[Outline of drawing and drawings|outline]]) &amp;ndash; visual art that makes use of any number of drawing instruments to mark a two-dimensional medium.
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures.
** [[Painting]] ([[Outline of painting|outline]]) &amp;ndash; practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a surface with a brush or other object.
** [[Art history]]
** [[Photography]] ([[Outline of photography|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art, science, and practice of creating pictures by recording radiation on a radiation-sensitive medium, such as a photographic film, or electronic image sensors.
** [[Sculpture]] ([[Outline of sculpture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; three-dimensional artwork created by shaping or combining hard materials - typically stone such as marble - or metal, glass, or wood.
* [[Performing arts]] ([[Outline of performing arts|outline]]) &amp;ndash; those forms of art that use the artist's own body, face, and presence as a medium.  Examples of performing arts include:
** [[Dance]] ([[Outline of dance|outline]]) &amp;ndash; art form of movement of the body, usually rhythmic and to music,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110116/dance Britannica.com]&lt;/ref&gt; used as a form of expression, social interaction, or presented in a spiritual or performance setting.
** [[Drama]] &amp;nbsp; study of regional, global, or historical theatre, as well as techniques for acting, directing and choreographing plays
** [[Film]] ([[Outline of film|outline]]) &amp;ndash; moving pictures, the art form that records performances visually.
** [[Installation art]] &amp;ndash; the merging of multiple genres into a coherent three-dimensional, multi-sensory work.

=== Humanities that are also social sciences ===
* [[Anthropology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of anthropology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of how humans developed biologically and culturally.
* [[Archaeology]] &amp;nbsp; research into human history by locating and studying artifacts, structural remains, and other surviving evidence
* [[Area studies]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular geographical, national/federal, or cultural regions. The term exists primarily as a general description for what are, in the practice of scholarship, many heterogeneous fields of research, encompassing both the social sciences and the humanities. Typical area studies programs involve history, political science, sociology, cultural studies, languages, geography, literature, and related disciplines. In contrast to cultural studies, area studies often include diaspora and emigration from the area studied.
* [[Communication studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of communication|outline]]) &amp;ndash; deals with processes of human communication, commonly defined as the sharing of symbols to create meaning. The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting. Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts.
* [[Cultural studies]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of culture|outline]]) &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary academic field grounded in [[critical theory]] and [[literary criticism]] that attempts to understand the political dynamics of contemporary culture, as well as its historical foundations, conflicts, and defining traits. Researchers concentrate on how a particular [[medium (communication)|medium]] or [[message]] relates to [[ideology]], [[social class]], [[nationality]], [[ethnicity]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]] and [[gender]] rather than investigating a particular culture or area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;In a loosely related but separate usage, the phrase '''cultural studies''' sometimes serves as a rough [[synonym]] for '''[[area studies]]''', as a general term referring to the academic study of particular cultures in departments and programs such as [[Islamic studies]], [[Asian studies]], [[African American studies]], ''et al.''. However, strictly speaking, cultural studies programs  are not concerned with specific areas of the world so much as specific cultural practices.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[History]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of history|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of the past.
* [[Law]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of law|outline]]) &amp;ndash; set of rules and principles by which a society is governed. (For branches, see ''Law'' under ''Society'' below).
* [[Linguistics]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of linguistics|outline]]) &amp;ndash; study of natural languages.
* [[Psychology]] &amp;nbsp; research of psychological pathology and therapeutic treatments separate from, but complementary to, [[Psychiatry|psychiatric medicine]]
* [[Sociology]] &amp;nbsp; study of social interaction between and among groups of people
* [[Technology]] &amp;nbsp; ([[Outline of technology|outline]]) &amp;ndash; making, usage, and knowledge of tools, machines, techniques, crafts, systems or methods of organization in order to solve a problem or perform a specific function. It can also refer to the collection of such tools, machinery, and procedures.

=== Interdisciplinary humanities ===
* [[Area studies]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary approach to studying a geographic area.
* [[Ecological humanities]] &amp;ndash; interdisciplinary area of research, drawing on the many environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged in the humanities over the past several decades (in particular environmental philosophy, environmental history and environmental anthropology).
* Ethno-cultural studies, such as: [[African-American studies]], [[Latino studies]], and other programs that take an interdisciplinary approach to ethno-cultural research
* [[Gender studies]] &amp;nbsp; interdisciplinary investigation of gender roles in culture, economics, business, politics, medicine, fine arts, media, etc.
* [[Library studies]]
* [[Museology]]
* [[Women's studies]] &amp;nbsp; interdisciplinary study of the roles of women and ways of defining and redefining the feminine identity

=== Applied humanities ===
* [[Applied arts]] &amp;nbsp; such as [[fashion design]], [[graphic design]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]]
* [[Health humanities]] &amp;ndash; application of humanities disciplines to discourse about, expression of, or the promotion of the dimensions of human health and well being.
* [[Medical humanities]] &amp;ndash; is an interdisciplinary field of medicine which includes the humanities and their application to medical education and practice.

== General humanities methodologies ==

There is no recognized [[etiology]] for infantilism and there is little research done on the subject. It has been linked to [[sadomasochism|masochism]] and a variety of other [[paraphilia]]s.  Although it commonly confused with [[pedophilia]], the two conditions are distinct and infantilists do not seek children as sexual partners.&lt;ref name = Arndt/&gt;&lt;ref name = Tiefenwerth/&gt;  A variety of causes have been proposed, including altered [[lovemap]]s, imprinting gone awry and [[erotic target location error|errors in erotic targets]], though there is no consensus.  A variety of organizations exist to discuss infantilism or meet with other practitioners throughout the world.

==Characteristics and behaviors==
The infantilist community is described by one practitioner as made up of two main types - adult babies (adults who [[role-playing|role play]] infants) and sissy babies (who tend to wear typically feminine clothing, and use female pronouns). There are also individuals who wear diapers but do not act as infants, either [[diaper fetishism|diaper lovers]] who eroticize diaper wearing, or sadomasochists who use diapers as a way of enforcing [[dominance and submission]].  Though the categories are discrete, in practice the behaviors found in each group often overlap.&lt;ref name="taormino"/&gt;  Adult babies roleplaying as a baby or small child for erotic stimulation is considered the signature expression of paraphilic infantilism.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OpkY2Fqwx_UC&amp;pg=PA70 70]}}&lt;ref name = holmes/&gt;  This may involve the use of adult-sized diapers and baby clothes or toys and furniture such as a [[Crib (furniture)|crib]] to lend reality to the infantilist [[fantasy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Baumeister | first = RF | year = 1989 | title = Masochism and Self | publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates | page = 159 | isbn = 0-8058-0486-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Cantor/&gt; crawling on the floor,&lt;ref name = Cantor/&gt; and some individuals may urinate or defecate in their diapers.&lt;ref name =Speaker/&gt;&lt;ref name = holmes/&gt;&lt;ref name = Cantor/&gt;  If a partner is willing, adult babies may engage in parent-baby roleplay including being bathed, powdered and changed into diapers by one's partner, before being put to bed with a baby bottle.&lt;ref name = Cantor/&gt;{{sfn|Money|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OpkY2Fqwx_UC&amp;pg=PA70 70]}}&lt;ref name = holmes/&gt;  Some may also simulate [[lactation]] with a willing partner.&lt;ref name = holmes/&gt; Thereafter the adult baby may be comforted  by their partner in the role of the parent and their diapers might be changed if wet or dirty.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OpkY2Fqwx_UC&amp;pg=PA70 70]}}  For some infantilists, the ritual might instead involve being scolded, spanked or chastised for having wet or dirtied their diapers.  In this latter instance the mode of arousal is masochistic.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OpkY2Fqwx_UC&amp;pg=PA70 70]}}  Others may only desire gentle or nurturing treatment, based on the desire to be cared for or to "surrender the responsibilities of adult life".&lt;ref name = Ditmore/&gt;  Some infantilists may involve [[masturbation]] and [[ejaculation]]&lt;ref name = Cantor/&gt;&lt;ref name = Ditmore&gt;{{cite book | last = Ditmore | first = MH | title = Encyclopedia of prostitution and sex work, Volume 1 | isbn = 0-313-32968-0 | publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] | year = 2006 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcYq72qYRTcC&amp;pg=PA238#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 238] }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others may choose not to engage in sex since it is not babylike.{{sfn|Stekel|1952|pp=143&amp;ndash;144}}  The erotic pleasure derived from either of these forms of infantilism may replace the need for [[sexual intercourse]] in reaching [[orgasm]].{{sfn|Money|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OpkY2Fqwx_UC&amp;pg=PA70 70]}}

In one study of AB/DL website participants, 93% of the sample was male (excluding transgender individuals). 58% of the men and 34% of the women were heterosexual. Males first became interested in AB/DL at age 11, and started practicing it at 13, compared to 12 and 16 for females, respectively. The most frequent activities were wearing diapers, wetting, and using other baby items. 87% of the men and 91% of the women reported that their AB/DL had not caused any significant problems or distress.&lt;ref name="hawkinson"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hawkinson, K., &amp; Zamboni, B.

==Prevalence==
Meaningful information on the [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] or [[prevalence]] of any of the paraphilias are lacking due to the often clandestine nature of such practices.&lt;ref name = Cantor/&gt; Similarly, it has been observed that infantilism is a [[closeted]] activity and it is not well documented in the medical literature.&lt;ref name="pate"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mednet2002&gt;{{cite web|last=Pretlow |first=Robert A |title=The internet can reveal previously unknown causes of medical conditions, such as attraction to diapers as a cause of enuresis and incontinence |publisher=Mednet |year=2002 |url=http://www.mednet2002.org/abstracts/display.cfm?id=166472151 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217215747/http://www.mednet2002.org/abstracts/display.cfm?id=166472151 |archivedate=2006-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study reported that 9% of [[Yahoo!

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Given these issues the potential of anonymous internet surveys for data collection on infantilist communities has been noted.&lt;ref name=Mednet2002/&gt;

One study members of the ABDL online community, however, noted that males became interested in paraphilic infantilism earlier than females, at age 11 rather than 12, and also began to act on their interests earlier, at 13 rather than 16. The same study found that while most males interested in paraphilic  infantilism were primarily straight (58%), most females were primarily bisexual (43%). 34% of women were primarily straight. Although both men and women varied in terms of education, only 66% of men and 39% of women earned more than $25,000 a year.&lt;ref name="Hawkinson 863–877"/&gt;

==Relation to other conditions==
Infantilism is a diffuse phenomenon and different authorities have taken varied approaches to the question of its medical and sexological classification.

===Definitions===
The conventional definition of infantilism means the persistence of childlike traits in adults and medically the failure to attain sexual maturity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/infantilism | title = Infantilism | accessdate = 2011-08-24 | publisher = dictionary.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "sexual infantilism" is also used medically as a synonym for [[delayed puberty]].&lt;ref name = Hickey /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Greenspan | first = FS |author2=Gardner DG | year = 2004 | title =  Basic &amp; Clinical Endocrinology | isbn = 0-07-140297-7 | chapter = Puberty | pages = 617–627}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "psychosexual infantilism" was used in [[Sigmund Freud]]'s theory of [[psychosexual development]] to refer to individuals who had not matured through its hypothetical stages into [[heterosexuality]].&lt;ref name = Cantor/&gt;  [[Psychology|Psychologist]] [[Wilhelm Stekel]] used "psychosexual infantilism" as a category similar to [[paraphilia]], including paraphilic infantilism{{sfn|Stekel|1952|pp=143&amp;ndash;144}} and other paraphilias and sexual orientations.{{sfn|Stekel|1952|p=vii}}

===Masochism===
{{main|Sadomasochism}}
The ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM'') states that along with other behaviors, [[sadomasochism|sexual masochists]] "...may have a desire to be treated as a helpless infant and clothed in diapers ('infantilism')"&lt;ref name="DSM572"&gt;{{cite book|last=American Psychiatric Association|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington DC|year=2000|isbn=0-89042-024-6|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3SQrtpnHb9MC&amp;pg=572 572]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this association is repeated by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|title=Professional Guide to Diseases|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-7899-2|year=2009|edition=9th|editor=Catherine Harold| page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1h6vu60L6FcC&amp;pg=PA1341 1341]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FR-9qNW-JA4C&amp;pg=PT719 719]|last1=Kring|first1=Ann|last2=Johnson|first2=Sheri|last3=Davison|first3=Gerald C.|last4=Neale|first4=John M.|title=Abnormal Psychology|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=978-0-470-57712-7|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Becker|first1= Judith V.|last2= Stinson|first2= Jill D. |year=2008|chapter=Human sexuality and sexual dysfunctions|editor = Robert E.

Psychologists D. Richard Laws and [[William O'Donohue]] state that "Although infantilism is classified as a sexual masochism in the ''DSM-IV'' and ''DSM-IV-TR'', it is questionable whether the criteria for sexual masochism are always met.  For example, if the infantile role playing does not involve feelings of humiliation and suffering, then the diagnosis of sexual masochism would not be appropriate and a diagnosis of infantilism as a paraphilia [not otherwise specified] is warranted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Laws|first1=D.

Arndt considers paraphilic infantilism to combine forms of fetishism, tranvestism and masochism.&lt;ref name = Arndt&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Arndt|first=William B.|title=Gender Disorders and Paraphilias|publisher=International Universities Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0-8236-2150-7 | page = 394}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilhelm Stekel considered sado-masochistic practices to be variant behavior arising from psychosexual infantilism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dailey|first=Dennis M.|title=The Sexually Unusual: A Guide to Understanding and Helping|year=1989| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=rrzfTYSPs3oC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA44 44] |isbn=0-86656-786-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A potential connection between paraphilic infantilism and sadomasochism has been noted in the Polish publication, Przegląd Seksuologiczny. Research results within the publication indicated that 28% of those paraphilic infantalists surveyed reported an interest in [[BDSM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wojciech|first1=Oronowicz|title=AB/DL group.

===Pedophilia===
{{main|Pedophilia}}

Confusing infantilism with pedophilia is a common misunderstanding&lt;ref name = Arndt/&gt; but infantilism involves role-playing exclusively with other adults;&lt;ref name = Tiefenwerth&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Tiefenwerth|first=Thomas J.|title= Criminal Sexuality and Psychopathology: Pornography as a Contributory Risk Factor in the Psycho-Social Development of Violent Sex Offenders | publisher=[[ProQuest]] |year=2007|isbn=978-0-549-14928-6 | page = 111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; infantilism is not related to pedophilia, or any form of [[child sexual abuse]].&lt;ref name = holmes&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Holmes|first1=Ronald M.|last2=Holmes|first2=Stephen T.|title=Sex Crimes: Patterns and Behavior | publisher = [[SAGE Publications]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 1-4129-5298-0 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=_zqOsZSZxYQC&amp;pg=PA81#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 81]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexologist [[Gloria Brame]] states that "...infantilists who recognize and accept their sexuality - and its possible roots in infantile trauma - tend to be acutely protective of real children."&lt;ref name = Brame/&gt;

John Money states that diaper fetishists may be sexually attracted to diaper-wearing babies, a condition he calls nepiophilia, but describes infantilism as autonepiophilia in which the individual desires to be and impersonate a baby and does not desire an infant as a sexual partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Money|first=John|title=Principles of Developmental Sexology | publisher = [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] | year=1997|isbn=978-0-8264-1026-9 | page = 255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, sexologists [[Ray Blanchard]] and [[Kurt Freund]] published and discussed a series of [[case study|case studies]] involving infantilists&lt;ref name = Cantor/&gt; and noted a distinction between them and pedophiles.  While pedophiles were attracted to children (and objects related to childhood) due to the desire for a child sexual partner, infantilists imagined themselves as children and adopted the objects of childhood or infancy to increase the power difference between themselves and their preferred sexual partners of adult women, with whom they acted out masochistic fantasies.&lt;ref name = Freund/&gt;

===Other conditions===
In the limited number of extant medical case reports some clinicians have attempted to explain the behaviors associated with infantilism in terms of [[obsessive compulsive disorder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Croarkin | first1 = Paul | last2 = Nam | first2 = Theodore | last3 = Waldrep | first3 = Douglas|title= Comment on Adult Baby Syndrome (letter to the editor)|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 161 | issue = 11 | year = 2004 | page = 2141 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.161.11.2141-a|pmid=15514436}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "a concurrent cluster of symptoms found in a variety of psychiatric disorders",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evcimen|first1=Harun| last2= Gratz| first2=Silvia|title=Adult Baby Syndrome (letter to the editor)|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 35  | issue = 2 | page = 116 | doi=10.1007/s10508-005-9002-6|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a form of [[autoeroticism]] analogous to [[Ray Blanchard]]'s concept of [[Anatomic autogynephilia|autogynephilia]] as applied in certain cases of [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name = Cantor&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Sexual Disorders | author = [[James Cantor|Cantor J]] |author2=[[Ray Blanchard|Blanchard R]] |author3=Barbaree H | title = Oxford Textbook of Psychopathology|editor=Blaney PH &amp; Millon T | edition = 2nd | year = 2009 | location = New York &amp; Oxford|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-537421-6|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5bAPxqDyFxUC&amp;pg=PA530#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 530–7]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Freund&gt;{{Cite journal

====Diaper fetishism====
Individuals with [[diaper fetishism]] typically do not imagine themselves as babies. Rather, they more often see themselves as adults who are drawn to wearing diapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

| doi=10.1176/ajp.122.12.1435
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Money distinguishes between infantilism or autonepiophilia and paraphilic diaper-wearing, stating that the latter is a paraphilic fetish that manifests as an erotic attraction to an article of clothing while the former is a non-fetishistic paraphilia directed at a change of status in terms of age identity.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OpkY2Fqwx_UC&amp;pg=PA96#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 96]}}

====Cross-dressing====
Infantilists, usually male, may also engage in [[cross-dressing]] and wear clothes stereotypically associated with young girls.  This type of behavior is referred to as being a "sissy baby".  Masochistic infantilists may wish to be [[pinaforing|forcibly cross-dressed]].&lt;ref name="taormino"&gt;{{cite news | last = Taormino | first = T | url = http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-08-13/columns/still-in-diapers/ | title = Still in Diapers | accessdate = 2007-05-08 | work = [[The Village Voice]] | date = 2002-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Marx&gt;{{cite book | last = Marx | first = E | isbn = 1-60550-106-9 | title = 101 Things You Didn't Know about Sex | publisher = Adams Media | year = 2009 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVn0xVD9h3QC&amp;pg=PA145#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 145] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==
To date no broad-based scientific studies have been made on the cause, incidence and general impact of paraphilic infantilism on society at large.  This may be due to both the relative rarity of the condition and because few paraphilic infantilists appear to seek professional mental health counseling,&lt;ref name="pate" /&gt;{{sfn | Stekel | 1952 | pp=143&amp;ndash;144 }} and that even fewer appear to require any type of pro-active mental health intervention.&lt;ref name = Pandita/&gt;  A 2002 case report by psychiatrists Jennifer Pate and Glen Goddard found little research on the topic, and they suggested the ''DSM'' lacked a category that captured their patient's disorder.&lt;ref name = "pate"/&gt;  Research on the [[etiology]] of paraphilias in general is minimal and as of 2008 had essentially come to a standstill; it is not clear whether the development of infantilism shares a common cause with other paraphilias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Rowland | first = DL |author2=Incrocci L | year = 2008 | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=RBgSDZCZAzEC&amp;pg=PA522#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 522] | isbn = 0-470-25721-0 | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | title = Handbook of Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Criminology|Criminologists]] Stephen and Ronald Holmes believe that while there is no simple answer to the origins of infantilism, the practices may involve an element of [[stress management|stress reduction]] similar to that of [[transvestism]].&lt;ref name = holmes/&gt;

===Lovemap theory===
John Money developed the theory of a [[lovemap]], &lt;blockquote&gt;
"a developmental representation or template in the mind and in the brain depicting the idealized lover and the idealized program of sexual and erotic activity projected in imagery or actually engaged in".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Money thought that the lovemap was normally fully developed by the age of 8, serving as a kind of sexual template through to the end of one's adult life.{{sfn|Money|1986|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OpkY2Fqwx_UC&amp;pg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 290]}}  Money believed all paraphilias were caused by the formation of abnormal lovemaps during the preadolescent years and that such abnormal lovemaps can be formed by any number of contributing factors or stressors during this developmental period.{{sfn|Money|1986|p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=OpkY2Fqwx_UC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 34]}}  Money also coined the term "autonepiophilia" meaning a "diaperism" or diaper fetishism in 1984 to describe the condition.&lt;ref name = Money84&gt;{{Cite journal

===Imprinting===
It has been hypothesized that, among other possible causes, sexual templates are established by a process akin to [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] where lack of availability of female genitals during a critical period of development causes the imprinting mechanism to instead associate with the nearest [[Visual perception|visual]] or [[Olfaction|olfactory]] approximation.  In the case of infantilism, the discipline of the mother or wearing diapers may create associations between pain, humiliation and sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Wilson|first=Glen Daniel|title=Variant Sexuality: Research and Theory|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=1987|isbn=0-7099-3698-2|pages = [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_NUOAAAAQAAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA107 107–11]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Erotic location target error===
An additional theory is that infantilism is an erotic identity disorder where the erotic fantasy is centered on the self rather than on a sexual partner and results from an [[erotic target location error|erotic targeting location error]] where the erotic target was children yet becomes inverted. According to this model, proposed by Ray Blanchard and Kurt Freund in 1993, infantilism is a sexual attraction to the idea of the self being a child.&lt;ref name=Cantor/&gt;

==History==
The first public event for adult babies was "Baby Week", occurring in [[San Francisco]] in the early 1990s. Subsequently the internet became a major forum, with numerous websites offering books, magazines, audio and video tapes and related [[paraphernalia]], as well as a 24-hour hotline.  Paraphilic infantilism has appeared as an [[alternative lifestyle]] in numerous [[Western culture|Western]] countries including the [[United States]], [[England]], [[Germany]] and [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Kaufman | first = F |year= 1997 |title= Our Binkies, Our Selves: The adult baby boom |journal= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]  |volume= 13|issue= 7|pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=G-86CzNjg9cC&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 55] |publisher= SPIN Media LLC |doi= |url= |accessdate= | issn = 0886-3032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization "Diaper Pail Friends" was established in San Francisco, growing to approximately 3,000 members in 1995 through magazine articles, books, talk shows and the Internet.  The organization was studied in 1995 by a group of sexologists, though the results were not published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editors = Noonan R | pages = 1248–9 | url = http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/pdf/ccies-unitedstates-part2.pdf | format = PDF | title = The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality | isbn =0-8264-1488-5 | publisher = The Continuum International Publishing Group Inc. | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, the [[New York City|New York]] organization "Still in Diapers" was founded for diaper fetishists.&lt;ref name="taormino"/&gt; In 2008, the Diaper Pail Friends had expanded to a national organization and claimed a membership of 15,000.&lt;ref name = holmes/&gt;

Integrating performing arts into educational experiences can help students learn other subjects, such as science, as well as help them develop various non-arts-based skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Integration-Teaching-Multicultural-Settings/dp/0132565560|title=Arts Integration: Teaching Subject Matter through the Arts in Multicultural Settings|last=Goldberg|first=Merryl|date=2011-04-11|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780132565561|edition=4|location=Boston|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow, engaging them in performance arts can help them meet developmental milestones, including those for [[motor skill]]s and [[Psychosocial|psychosocial skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/18985575/childrens-developmental-benchmarks-and-stages|title=Children's Developmental Benchmarks and Stages|last=Yumpu.com|newspaper=yumpu.com|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, teachers can integrate performing arts and the discussion thereof into their classrooms to honor student [[Self-expression values|self-expression]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/vp/cf/|title=Curriculum Frameworks - Visual &amp; Performing Arts (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual youth can benefit from this type of [[arts integration]] because it offers them modes of communication that can respond more easily to their culture and language than text-based or test-based learning.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Emergent-Bilingual-Youth-Culturally/dp/0415509742|title=The Arts and Emergent Bilingual Youth: Building Culturally Responsive, Critical and Creative Education in School and Community Contexts|last=Chappell|first=Sharon Verner|last2=Faltis|first2=Christian J.|date=2013-04-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415509749|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the language used, teachers have found that using performing arts in the classroom, such as improvisational drama, can help students process and prepare for non-arts-based life situations, including [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Artful-Teaching-Integrating-Understanding-Curriculum/dp/0807750808|title=Artful Teaching: Integrating the Arts for Understanding Across the Curriculum, K-8|last=Donahue|first=David M.|date=2010-06-02|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=9780807750803|editor-last=Stuart|editor-first=Jennifer|location=New York; Reston, VA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performing arts integration out of schools'''

Performing arts integration that empowers students in these ways doesn't only happen in schools; community organizations, such as the Beat Nation Collective in Canada, use hip hop performance to help students deepen their understanding of and broaden their experience with indigenous identity and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorliewski|first=Julie|last2=Porfilio|first2=Brad|year=2012|title=Revolutionizing Environmental Education through Indigenous Hip Hop Culture|journal=Canadian Journal of Environmental Education|volume=17|pages=46–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Issues of access and equity'''

Despite the benefits of engaging students in performing arts, many students, particularly minority students such as African American and Latino students, do not have equitable access to performing arts in their school classrooms.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

==Discipline-based performing arts==

The performing arts differ from the [[plastic arts]] insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and/or presence as a medium Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] by special [[clothing]], [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], etc.

For students pursuing elite [[profession]]al [[career]]s in performing arts like [[classical ballet]] and [[circus]] arts, the physical demands are such that early entry into training can be essential.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The breadth of areas covered by the performing arts is wide, including:
*[[Acting]]
**[[Comedy]]
**[[Drama]]
**[[Magic (illusion)|Magic]]
**[[Film]]
**[[Opera]]
**[[Theatre]]
*[[Music]]
**[[Busking]]
**[[Opera]]
*[[Dance]]
*[[Circus skills]]
**[[Acrobatics]]

==Biography==

[[File:Anglo-Flemish School, Arthur, Prince of Wales (Granard portrait) -003.png|thumb|right|upright|Portrait of [[Arthur, Prince of Wales]] (1486–1502) reidentified by Mould]]

Mould was educated at [[Kingsmead School, Hoylake]], [[Worth School]] and the [[University of East Anglia]] from where he graduated with a BA in History of Art in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;'MOULD, Philip Jonathan Clifford', Who's Who 2014, A &amp; C Black, an imprint of Bloomsbury Publishing plc, 2014; online edn, Oxford University Press, Dec 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Mould's father owned a factory in Liverpool and his family was based in the Wirral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/my-perfect-weekend/10560561/My-perfect-weekend-Philip-Mould-art-sleuth.html|title=My perfect weekend: Philip Mould, art sleuth|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in antiques at an early age, thanks to his mother. She contracted polio as a child, and was in a wheelchair so would send Philip, aged six, into antiques shops to bring things out to her for inspection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3827475/I-sold-signed-copy-John-Lennon-s-Mind-Games-50p-Philip-Mould-gives-definitive-answers-probing-questions.html|title=The definite article: This week it’s host Philip Mould|newspaper=Mail Online|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mould made friends with the owner of a local antiques shop, who taught him to read hallmarks on silver when he was just 11 or 12 years old, and by the age of 14 he was dealing in antique silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/my-perfect-weekend/10560561/My-perfect-weekend-Philip-Mould-art-sleuth.html|title=My perfect weekend: Philip Mould, art sleuth|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mould began art dealing in his early teens and has since established a leading art dealership specialising in British art, a subject on which he is internationally consulted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett |first=Will |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1521012/Lost-portrait-reveals-the-soft-side-of-Elizabeth-I.html |title=Telegraph 12 June 2006 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=12 June 2006 |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has sold works to public institutions such as [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (New York),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/426019|title=John Vanderbank, the younger {{!}} Self-Portrait {{!}} The Met|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art, i.e. The Met Museum|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Portrait Gallery (London)]], [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/portrait-of-a-lady-as-a-shepherdess-563890|title=Portrait of a Lady as a Shepherdess|date=2017-02-05|newspaper=Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tate]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/richardson-portrait-of-the-artists-son-jonathan-richardson-the-younger-in-his-study-t13207|title="Portrait of the Artist’s Son, Jonathan Richardson the Younger, in his Study", Jonathan Richardson c.1734 {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|website=Tate|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Huntington Library|The Huntington]] (California),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://emuseum.huntington.org/objects/12419/portrait-of-a-young-child?ctx=1dcfd205-5a0e-4d8f-8a1d-87aac4595541&amp;idx=0|title=Portrait of a Young Child – Works – The Huntington Art Collections Online Catalog|website=emuseum.huntington.org|access-date=2017-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Royal Albert Memorial Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artfund.org/artsaved/search/philip+mould |title=The Art Fund, 'Art Saved' |publisher=Artfund.org |date= |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mould has worked as a valuer for the [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] and the Government's [[Acceptance in Lieu]] scheme. Between 1988–2010 he acted as honorary art adviser to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bennett |first=Will |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4722257/Bringing-art-into-politics.html |title=Telegraph 19 March 2001 |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=19 March 2001 |accessdate=6 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is president of the charity Kids in Museums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kidsinmuseums.org.uk/about/trustees/ |title=Kids in Museums website |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; president and ex-chairman of [[Plantlife International]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.plantlife.org.uk/about_us/our_team/our_trustees/ |title=Plantlife International website |publisher=Plantlife.org.uk |date= |accessdate=22 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504094135/http://www.plantlife.org.uk/about_us/our_team/our_trustees/ |archivedate=4 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; a patron of [[Fight for Sight (UK)|Fight for Sight]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fightforsight.org.uk/press-release/items/philip-mould-obe-joins-fight-for-sight-as-patron-327|title=Philip Mould OBE joins Fight for Sight as patron – Fight for Sight|last=|first=|year=2013|work=fightforsight.org.uk|accessdate=19 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325113323/http://fightforsight.org.uk/press-release/items/philip-mould-obe-joins-fight-for-sight-as-patron-327|archivedate=25 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a trustee and director of the [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] Memorial Trust for the acquisition of historical works for museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tonybanks.org/ |title=Tony Banks Memorial Trust|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926094647/http://www.tonybanks.org/|archivedate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.endole.co.uk/company/06208857/the-tony-banks-memorial-trust-limited |title=The Tony Banks Memorial Trust Limited - Company Information - Endole |first= |last= |work=endole.co.uk |year=2015 |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mould is also a supporter of CleanupUK, and Pond Conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pondconservation.org.uk/about/News/pressreleases/millionpondsprojectlaunch/|title=Pond Conservation website|publisher=pondconservation.org.uk|date=|accessdate=22 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203082735/http://www.pondconservation.org.uk/about/News/pressreleases/millionpondsprojectlaunch/|archivedate=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected as a fellow of the [[Linnean Society]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linnean.org/|title=The Linnean Society website|publisher=linnean.org |date= |accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mould is a regular broadcaster, reviewer and writer for the national press.  His television work includes writing and presenting the [[Channel 4]] series ''Changing Faces,'' and featuring as an expert on the ''[[Antiques Roadshow]].'' In 2011, he began co-hosting the television programme ''[[Fake or Fortune?]]'' with [[Fiona Bruce]].&lt;ref name="FoF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01mxxz6|title=Fake or Fortune?|publisher=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=4 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Fake or Fortune?'' now ranks as television's most popular arts show - regularly drawing an audience of 5 million - and has an international following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/its-a-copy-fake-or-fortune-stars-try-to-halt-rival-show-6gstpwtrz|title=It’s a copy: Fake or Fortune? stars try to halt rival show|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Mould warned of the increasing prevalence of what he termed "trapping" in which crooked sellers misleadingly hint that fake artworks have genuine provenance, without actually making false descriptions or asserting attributions.&lt;ref name="Copping"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10566055/Art-experts-warn-of-the-rise-of-the-trappers.html|title=Art experts warn of the rise of the 'trappers'|last=Copping|first=Jasper|date=12 January 2014|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mould is the author of two critically acclaimed books on art discovery, which are frequently cited as illuminating and well told insights into the workings of the old master trade, and have been published in America, Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/5567418/Sleuth-The-Amazing-Quest-for-Lost-Art-Treasures-by-Philip-Mould-review.html|title=Sleuth: The Amazing Quest for Lost Art Treasures by Philip Mould: review|last=Reid|first=By Aileen|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of his art world expertise and contribution to portrait heritage he was created [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in the [[2005 New Year Honours]] list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/news/nyhons05.htm |title=The British Theatre Guide: New Year Honours List 2005 |publisher=Britishtheatreguide.info |date=4 January 2005 |accessdate=6 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050122024515/http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/news/nyhons05.htm |archivedate=22 January 2005 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For his achievements in his field, as well as his involvement with numerous charities and broadcasting, Mould received an [[honorary doctorate]] in July 2013 at his [[Alma mater|former university]], the [[University of East Anglia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uea.ac.uk/mac/comm/media/press/2013/May/hon-grads|title=UEA to honour notable alumni at its 50th anniversary graduation|date=21 May 2013|publisher=University of East Anglia|accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, Mould was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' opposing [[Scottish independence]] in the run-up to September's [[Scottish independence referendum, 2014|referendum on that issue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories &amp;#124; Politics |publisher=theguardian.com |date=2014-08-07 |accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015 Mould appeared on BBC's ''[[Gardeners' World]]'', in the garden of his home, discussing his passion for nature and talked of his interest in varieties of rose which would have been grown in the time of [[Anthony van Dyck|Sir Anthony van Dyck]]. He also discussed the work of one of his favourite artists, [[Cedric Morris]], who was also a great [[plantsman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06h3zs2 |title=BBC Two - Gardeners' World, 2015, Episode 29 |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=9 October 2015 |accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mould is a keen collector of Morris's work (for his private collection), and champions modern British artists in general; he cites the [[Bloomsbury Group]] amongst his favourites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/my-perfect-weekend/10560561/My-perfect-weekend-Philip-Mould-art-sleuth.html|title=My perfect weekend: Philip Mould, art sleuth|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Piraeus Lion''' ({{lang-it|Leone del Pireo}}; {{lang-sv|Pireuslejonet}}); is one of four [[lion]] statues on display at the [[Venetian Arsenal]], where it was displayed as a symbol of Venice's patron saint, [[Saint Mark]].

== History ==
It was originally located in [[Piraeus]], the harbour of [[Athens]]. It was looted by Venetian naval commander [[Francesco Morosini]] in 1687 as [[plunder]] taken in the [[Great Turkish War]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]], during which the Venetians [[Siege of the Acropolis (1687)|captured Athens]] and Morosini's cannons caused damage to the [[Parthenon]] only matched by his subsequent looting.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Athens, The Acropolis, p.6/20, 2008, O.Ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the statue can also be seen at the [[Piraeus Archaeological Museum]] and the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] in [[Stockholm]].

The lion was originally sculpted in about 360 BC,&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius Vermeule, "Greek Funerary Animals, 450-300 B. C.", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' '''76''':1:49-59 (January 1972), {{jstor|503610}}, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; and became a famous landmark in Piraeus, having stood there since the 1st or 2nd century AD. Its prominence was such that the port eventually became referred to in Italian as Porto Leone ("Lion Port") as the port's original name ceased to be used.&lt;ref&gt;Goette, Hans Rupprecht (2001), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=FRHY3zWyrcEC Athens, Attica and the Megarid: An Archaeological Guide]''. [[Routledge]]. p. 141. {{ISBN|0-415-24370-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is depicted in a sitting pose, with a hollow throat and the mark of a pipe (now lost) running down its back; this suggests that it was originally used as a fountain.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Henry (1833). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1K_TIaJxo8EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The British Museum. Elgin and Phigaleian Marbles]''. [[British Museum]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the description of the statue from the 1670s, which said that water flowed from the lion's mouth into a cistern at its feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jarring |first=Gunnar |authorlink= |title=Evliya Celebi och Marmorlejonet från Pireus |journal=[[Fornvännen]] |volume=85 |pages=1–4 |publisher=[[Swedish National Heritage Board]] |year=1978 |url=http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1970talet/1978_001.pdf |issn=1404-9430 |accessdate=5 September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue, which is made of white [[marble]] and stands some 3&amp;nbsp;m (9&amp;nbsp;ft.) high, is particularly noteworthy for having been defaced some time in the second half of the 11th century by Scandinavians who carved two lengthy [[Runic alphabet|runic]] inscriptions into the shoulders and flanks of the lion.&lt;ref&gt;[[T. D. Kendrick|Kendrick, Thomas D.]] (2004). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z8NgXgRytUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false A History of the Vikings]''. Courier Dover Publications. p. 176. {{ISBN|0-486-43396-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The runes are carved in the shape of an elaborate [[lindworm]] dragon-headed [[scroll]], in much the same style as on [[runestone]]s in [[Scandinavia]].&lt;ref name=BussLion&gt;"The Book of THoTH (Leaves of Wisdom) — Dragon" (notes), URL: [http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/index.php/Dragon BT-Dragon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080325220622/http://www.book-of-thoth.com/thebook/index.php/Dragon |date=25 March 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The carvers of the runes were almost certainly [[Varangians]], Scandinavian mercenaries in the service of the [[Byzantine Emperor | Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Emperor]].

== Inscriptions and translations ==

[[File:Lion runes drawing.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Drawing of the same inscription.]]
The inscriptions were not recognised as runes until the Swedish diplomat [[Johan David Åkerblad]] identified them at the end of the 18th century. They are in the shape of a [[lindworm]] (a flightless dragon with serpentine body and two or no legs) and were first translated in the mid-19th century by [[Carl Christian Rafn]], the Secretary of the Kongelige Nordiske Oldskrift-Selskab (Royal Society of Nordic Antiquaries).&lt;ref name="Rafn"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rafn |first=Carl Christian  |authorlink=Carl Christian Rafn |contribution=En Nordisk Runeindskrift i Piræus, med Forklaring af C.

This has required translators to reconstruct some of the runes, filling in the blanks to determine what words they represented.

There have been several attempts to decipher and translate the text. Below follow Rafn's early attempt (1854) and Eric Brate's attempt (1914), which is considered to be the most successful one.&lt;ref name="Pritsak348"&gt;[[Omeljan Pritsak|Pritsak, Omeljan]]. (1981).

== Rafn's translation ==
Rafn's attempt is as follows, with the legible letters shown in bold and the reconstructed ones unbolded:&lt;ref&gt;A. Craig Gibson, "Runic Inscriptions: Anglo-Saxon and Scandinavian", in ''Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire'', p. 130.

Some have tried to trace [[Harald Hardrade]]'s name on the inscription, but the time it was carved does not coincide with his time in the service of the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Ian (1985).

'''School of Paris''' refers to the many [[Manuscript illumination|manuscript illuminators]], whose identities are mostly unknown, who made Paris an internationally important centre of illumination throughout the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods of the [[Middle Ages]], and for some time into the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://metmuseum.org/toah/ht/08/euwf.html France 1400-1600, Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History]&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous of these artists were [[Master Honoré]],&lt;ref&gt;Branner, Robert (1977) ''Manuscript Painting in Paris During the Reign of Saint Louis: A Study of Styles''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8761">'''Scopophilia''' or '''scoptophilia''' (from {{lang-grc|σκοπέω}} {{lang|grc-Latn|skopeō}}, "look to, examine" and {{lang|grc|φῐλῐ́ᾱ}} {{lang|grc-Latn|philíā}}, "tendency toward"), is deriving pleasure from looking. As an expression of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], it refers to [[sexual pleasure]] derived from looking at erotic objects: erotic photographs, [[pornography]], [[nudity|naked bodies]], etc.

==Psychoanalysis==

The term was introduced to translate [[Freud]]'s {{lang|de|Schaulust}}, or pleasure in looking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacques Lacan]], ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered pleasure in looking to be a regular partial instinct in childhood,&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Sexuality'' (PFL 7) pp. 109–10&lt;/ref&gt; which might be sublimated into interest in art, or alternatively become fixated into what the [[Rat Man]] called "a burning and tormenting curiosity to see the female body".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Sigmund Freud, ''Case Histories II'' (PFL 9) pp. 41–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud thought that inhibition of scopophilia might lead to actual disturbances of vision;&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Psychopathology'' (PFL 10) pp. 112–3&lt;/ref&gt; other analysts have suggested that it might lead to a retreat from concrete objects into a world of abstractions.&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

Scopophilia was developed in the psychoanalytic theorizing of [[Otto Fenichel]], with special reference to [[Identification (psychology)|identification]].&lt;ref&gt;Otto Fenichel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zk5gPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=the+collected+papers+of+otto+fenichel&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZhhhTbTNGc3Oswa3uLW1CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ ''The Scoptophilic Instinct and Identification''] (1953) {{ISBN|0-393-33741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fenichel maintained that "a child who is looking for libidinous purposes...wants to look at an object in order to 'feel along with him'".&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; He also explored how looking could substitute for acting in those anxious to avoid guilt.&lt;ref&gt;Fenichel, ''Theory'', p. 348&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Lacan]] subsequently drew on [[Sartre]]'s theory of the gaze to link scopophilia with the apprehension of the other: "the gaze is this object lost and suddenly refound in the conflagration of shame, by the introduction of the other".&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; Lacan privileged scopophilia in his theory of how desire is captured by the [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] image of the other;&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Television'' (1990) p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; other French analysts have emphasised how the discovery of sexual difference in childhood, and the accompanying sense of not knowing subsequently fuels the scopophilic drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schneiderman|first1=Stuart|title=Returning to Freud: Clinical Psychoanalysis in the School of Lacan|date=1980|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300039320|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==

[[Voyeurism]] plays a role in the films of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], most notably in the 1960 film, ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In the film, [[Norman Bates]] is revealed to have a peephole to one of the hotel rooms. He uses this to spy on [[Marion Crane]], while she is in a state of undress.

Scopophilia is mentioned by name in director Michael Powell's ''Peeping Tom'' (1960). The entire film is an exercise in voyeurism. Powell, and his screenwriter, Leo Marks, created to prove to what extent how one is capable of watching things one shouldn't watch. At the same time, Powell created a psychological essay about what makes Mark Lewis, the central character of the film, act the way he acted. Mark has been scarred for life thanks to what his own father did to him during a period of his growing years that formed his character into the reclusive man who feels at home doing the despicable crimes he commits. (I.M.D.B.)

Building on Lacan's work,&lt;ref&gt;Jane Mills,[https://books.google.com/books?id=65HbQfMKmAIC&amp;pg=PA223&amp;dq=scopophobia&amp;lr= "The Money Shot"] (2001) {{ISBN|1-86403-142-5}},  p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; scopophilia was used by [[Film|cinema]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]]s of the 1970s to describe pleasures (often considered pathological) and other unconscious processes occurring in spectators when they watch films.&lt;ref&gt;John Thornton Caldwell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=59S8pfkFb-IC&amp;pg=PA342&amp;dq=scopophobia#PPA343,M1 ''Televisuality: Style, Crisis, and Authority in American Television''] (1995) {{ISBN|0-8135-2164-5}}, p. 343&lt;/ref&gt; [[Voyeurism]] and the [[male gaze]] have been seen as central elements in such mainstream cinematic viewing,&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi, ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) pp. 316–17&lt;/ref&gt; and are most famously discussed in [[Laura Mulvey]]'s influential 1975 essay "Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulvey|first=Laura|title=Visual and Other Pleasures|year=2009|publisher=Palgrave MacMillan|location=England|isbn=978-1-4039-9246-8|pages=14–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others, however, have objected to the element of [[scapegoating]] in such an analysis of the variegated pleasures of movie-viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Miklitsch|first1=Robert|title=Roll over Adorno: Critical Theory, Popular Culture, Audiovisual Media|date=2006|publisher=[[State University of New York Press]]|isbn=978-0791467336|pages=93–94|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Roll_Over_Adorno.html?id=oCprHBiGYoMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Race==

[[Critical race theory|Critical race theorists]], such as [[bell hooks]],&lt;ref&gt;bell hooks, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8bCqfK3m3GsC&amp;q "Eating the Other"], 2006 {{ISBN|1-4288-1629-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Marriott,&lt;ref&gt;David Marriott, "Bordering On: The Black Penis", (1996), ''[[Textual Practice]]'' 10(1), pp. 9–28.&lt;/ref&gt; and Shannon Winnubst,&lt;ref&gt;Shannon Winnubst, [https://books.google.com/books?id=v8HwslvL598C&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=queer+freedom&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=HRxhTZv9M4jNswbY9IC2CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=snippet&amp;q=is%20the%20mirror%20racist&amp;f=false "Is the Mirror Racist?: Interrogating the Space of Whiteness"], (2006) {{ISBN|0-253-21830-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also taken up scopophilia and the scopic drive as a mechanism to describe racial "other-ing" (c.f. [[scopophobia]]).

In their theories scopophilia is a question of fixing the appearance and identity of the other through the gaze. So cultural scopophilia restricts the visible representations of racial identity that it allows.&lt;ref&gt;Todd W. Reeser, ''Masculinities in Theory'' (2011) pp. 164–5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary examples==
* The ''[[Satyricon]]'' of [[Gaius Petronius Arbiter]] is pervaded with scopophilia, as when a priestess of [[Priapus]] was "the first to put an inquisitive eye to a crack she had naughtily opened, and spy on their play with prurient eagerness".&lt;ref&gt;Petronius, ''[[The Satyricon]]'' (Penguin 1986) p. 50 and p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''Secret Sexualities'', Ian McCormick notes the inter-relationship of public and private, and of the open and the secret, as features that constitute transgressive or forbidden sexualities. In this respect, there is an example from Fanny's observation of two sodomites in ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure'' (1749): 'at length I observed a paper patch of the same colour as the wainscot, which I took to conceal some flaw; but then it was so high, that I was obliged to stand upon a chair to reach it, which I did as soft as possible, and, with a point of a bodkin, soon pierced it, and opened myself espial room sufficient. And now, applying my eye close, I commanded the room perfectly, and could see my two young sparks romping and pulling one another about, entirely, to my imagination, in frolic and innocent play.' &lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Ian. ''Secret Sexualities: A Sourcebook of 17th and 18th Century Writing''. Routledge, 1997. pp. 1-11; p. 158. See also George E. Haggerty. "Keyhole testimony: witnessing sodomy in the eighteenth century." ''The Eighteenth Century'' 44, no. 2/3 (2003): 167-182.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social gravity''' was an application of [[Newtonian gravity]] to the system of commerce influence.

For instance, in ''The Administration of the Colonies'' (1764), [[Thomas Pownall]] (1722–1805) used the Newtonian concept of "attraction" to form the basis of his political and commercial theory of empire. Pownall's vision provided an important explanation of the mechanism by which colonial theorists understood the possibility of empire being "transferred" from one state to another. Pownall applied the Newtonian concept of gravity to his theory of empire, as evident in his suggestion that the "laws of nature" held the colonies to [[Great Britain]] in a manner "analogous in all cases, by which the center of gravity in the solar system" held the planets in their orbits. In making this analogy, Pownall's notion of 'social gravity' drew upon earlier visions of social cohesion, particularly ideas of sociability in eighteenth-century Britain. These ideas, in turn, were often predicated upon Stoic notions of [[cosmopolitanism]], expressed by the key term [[oikeiôsis]], in order to stress the "moral" imperative for like-minded humans to forge bonds dedicated to the common good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Breuninger |first=Scott |date=Summer 2006 |title='Social Gravity' and the Translatio Tradition in Early American Theories of Empire |journal=Southern Quarterly |volume=43 |issue=4 |pages=70–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/score&gt;|width=120|caption=Three notes with staccato dots}}'''Staccato''' ({{IPA-it|stakˈkaːto|}}; Italian for "detached") is a form of [[Articulation (music)|musical articulation]]. In modern notation, it signifies a note of shortened duration,&lt;ref&gt;Willi Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1960), p. 708.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kennedy, ed., {{Full|date=June 2015}}&lt;!--The page citation is nice, but it is customary to cite dictionary entries by title.--&gt;''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music'', third edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1980), p. 617.&lt;/ref&gt; separated from the note that may follow by silence.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chew, "Staccato", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described by theorists and has appeared in music since at least 1676.&lt;ref&gt;Werner Bachmann, Robert E. Seletsky, [[David D. Boyden]], Jaak Liivoja-Lorius, Peter Walls, and Peter Cooke, "Bow", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 20th-century music, a dot placed above or below a note indicates that it should be played staccato, and a wedge is used for the more emphatic [[staccatissimo]]. However, before 1850, dots, dashes, and wedges were all likely to have the same meaning, even though some theorists from as early as the 1750s distinguished different degrees of staccato through the use of dots and dashes, with the dash indicating a shorter, sharper note, and the dot a longer, lighter one.  

A number of signs came to be used in the late 19th and early 20th centuries to discriminate more subtle nuances of staccato. These signs involve various combinations of dots, vertical and horizontal dashes, vertical and horizontal wedges, and the like, but attempts to standardize these signs have not generally been successful.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Chew, "Staccato", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;  

The example below illustrates the scope of the staccato dot:

:&lt;score&gt; {
\override Score.TimeSignature #'stencil = ##f
    &lt;&lt; \clef treble
        \relative c' {
            \stemNeutral &lt;e c'&gt;-. &lt;g d'&gt;-. &lt;g e'&gt;-. &lt;c, c'&gt;-.
            \stemUp a'-. c-. c-. d-.
        } \\ {
            s1
            f'4 f' g' g'
        }
    &gt;&gt;

}
&lt;/score&gt;

In the first measure, the pairs of notes are in the same musical [[Part (music)|part]] (or voice) since they are on a common stem. The staccato applies to both notes of the pairs. In the second measure, the pairs of notes are stemmed separately indicating two different parts, so the staccato applies only to the upper note.

The opposite musical articulation of staccato is [[legato]], signifying long and continuous notes.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kennedy and Joyce Bourne, "Staccato", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Music''{{Full|date=June 2015}}&lt;!--Third edition 1980 cited elsewhere in this article; is this the fourth, fifth, or some other edition?--&gt; (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; There is an intermediate articulation called either [[mezzo staccato]] or [[non legato]]. 

By default, in the music notation program [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]], "staccatos shorten a note by 50%."&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Spreadbury, Michael Eastwood, Ben Finn, and Jonathan Finn, "Sibelius 5 Reference", edition 5.2 (March 2008), p.&amp;nbsp;284.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Staccatissimo ==
In [[musical notation]], '''staccatissimo''' (plural: ''staccatissimi'' or the [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] form ''staccatissimos'') indicates that the notes are to be played extremely separated and distinct, a superlative staccato. This can be notated with little pikes over or under the notes, depending on [[Stem (music)|stem]] direction, as in this example from [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 0 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 0 in D minor]]:

: &lt;score&gt;
\new Score {
  \new Staff {
    \relative c' {
      \time 3/4
      \key d \minor
      \clef treble
      d8-&gt;(\ff cis d2~
      d4) a'-! d-!
      es-! e-! f-!
      fis-! g-! gis-!
      a8(-&gt; gis a4)
    }
  }
}
&lt;/score&gt;

Alternatively, it can be notated by writing the word "staccatissimo" or the abbreviation "staccatiss." over the staff. A few composers, such as Mozart, have used staccato dots accompanied by a written instruction ''staccatissimo'' when they mean the passage to be played ''staccatissimo''.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Farkas, ''The Art of French Horn Playing'' (Evanston: Summy-Birchard Company, 1956): p.&amp;nbsp;51. {{ISBN|978-0-87487-021-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2542">'''Synantherology''' is the study of the plant family [[Asteraceae]] (also called [[Compositae]]). The name of the field refers to the fused [[anther]]s possessed by members of the family, and recalls an old French name, ''synantherées'', for the family.

Although many of the plants of the Asteraceae were described for the European community at least as long ago as [[Theophrastus]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal | title = The Compositae Revisited | author = Arthur Cronquist | journal = Brittonia | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | date = Apr–Jun 1977 | pages = 137–153 | doi = 10.2307/2805847 | jstor = 2805847 }}&lt;/ref&gt; an organization of the family into [[tribe (biology)|tribe]]s, which remained largely stable throughout the 20th century, was published in 1873 by [[George Bentham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In a 1970 article titled "The New Synantherology", [[Harold E. Robinson]] advocated greater attention to microstructures (studied with the [[compound light microscope]]).  He was not the first, as [[Alexandre de Cassini]] and others of the 19th century split species based on fine distinctions of  microstructure, a tendency which Bentham found excessive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Microcharacters as Generic Markers in the Eupatorieae | author = Randall W.

There are four basic theatrical forms either defined, implied, or derived by or from Aristotle: Tragedy; Comedy; Melodrama; and Drama.  Any number of styles can be used to convey these forms.

A good working definition of, "Style", is ''how'' something is done.  Theatrical styles are influenced by their time and place, artistic and other social structures, as well as the individual style of the particular artist or artists.  As theater is a mongrel art form, a production may or may not have stylistic integrity with regard to script, acting, direction, design, music, and venue.

==Styles==

There are a variety of '''theatrical styles''' used in theater/drama. These include

'''[[Naturalism (theater)|Naturalism]]'''
Portraying life on stage with a close attention to detail, based on observation of real life.  Cause and effect are central to the script's structure, with the subjects focused on conflicts of "nature vs. nurture", the natural order of things, survival, notions of evolution.  The production style is one of everyday reality.  

'''[[Theatrical realism|Realism]]'''
Portraying characters on stage that are close to real life, with realistic settings and staging.  Realism is an effort to satisfy all the theatrical conventions necessary to the production, but to do so in a way that seems to be "normal" life.

'''[[Expressionism]]'''
Anti-realistic in seeing appearance as distorted and the truth lying within man. The outward appearance on stage can be distorted and unrealistic to portray an eternal truth or internal emotional conflict.

'''[[Theater of the Absurd|Absurdity]]'''
Presents a perspective that all human attempts at significance are illogical. Ultimate truth is chaos with little certainty. There is no necessity that need drive us.

'''[[Epic Theatre]]'''
As devised by Bertolt Brecht, epic theatre forces audience members to constantly return to rational observation, rather than emotional immersion. Sudden bursts of song, elements of absurdity and breaches of the fourth wall are all prime examples of how this rational observation is constantly revitalized; this idea is known as Verfremdungseffekt.

'''[[Melodrama]]'''
As devised by early Greek dramatists, these styles rely on stock characters and stereotypes  to portray stories in an exaggerated way, either tragic or comic. Links to '''commedia dell'arte'''.

'''[[Theatre of Cruelty]]'''
As developed by Antonin Artaud, a style that encourages the shock and horror of the audience, through the excessive use of light and sound, instead of active entertainment or emotional relaxation.

'''[[Physical theatre]]'''
A modernist approach to theatre which centralises a performer's movement as the key communicator of a play's storytelling. 

'''[[Poor theatre]]'''
Developed by Jerzy Growotski, this genre believes in the stripping back of set, props, costume, light and sound to allow focus to be placed solely upon the actors, their characterisation and the underlying human relationships.

'''[[Immersive theatre]]'''
Developed by Augusto Boal, these styles all place focus on the audience member's individuality: their personal decisions, opinions and emotions, and how that impacts those of the characters onstage. The audience firmly exists within the 'world of the play'. Links to '''Promenade''' and '''Forum''' theatre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">'''Transnational history''' is a field of [[history]] that looks at how developments within the history of one [[country]] have been shaped by developments outside of this country, e.g. how [[History of the British Isles|British history]] has been shaped by developments coming from [[France]], [[Germany]] or [[the US]]. The idea of transnationalism can be traced back to 1991, when [[Ian Tyrrell]] pioneered this approach but it was in the field of [[American Studies]], in the late 1990s, that the concept really was developed. Since then the term has been adopted by the field of history. 

As the concept is still relatively new with the field of history, a consensus has not emerged on how to define the term precisely. However, [[Denmark|Danish]] [[historian]] Nils Arne Sørensen emphasizes that an important feature of transnational history is to reject the [[nation state]] as the "natural" frame for historical analysis. This redirection of historical studies can be seen as countermove to the fact that the field of history was founded in the 19th century while the [[nationalism|nationalist]] movement was on the rise in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Nils Arne Sørensen (2009) "[https://tidsskrift.dk/historisktidsskrift/article/view/56424/76630 Den transnationale vending?]"i ''[[Historisk Tidsskrift (Denmark)|Historisk Tidsskrift]]'' Volume 109, Issue 2: 459-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier define transnational history as having to do with the "connections and circulations" between societies in the [[modern age]].&lt;ref&gt;Akira Iriye and Pierre-Yves Saunier (2009) ''Palgrave Dictionary of Transnational History''. Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Ian Tyrrell argues that transnational history is related to the [[Annales school]].&lt;ref&gt;Ian Tyrrell (2008) [https://iantyrrell.wordpress.com/what-is-transnational-history/ "What is transnational history?"] ''Ian Tyrell'' (blog)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6259">The '''Universal Soil Loss Equation''' (USLE) is a widely used [[mathematical model]] that describes [[soil erosion]] processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hudson, Norman|title=Field Measurement of Soil Erosion and Runoff, Issue 68|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=1993|isbn=9789251034064|pages=121–126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rS1fiFU3rOwC&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erosion models play critical roles in soil and [[water]] resource [[conservation ethic|conservation]] and [[nonpoint source pollution]] assessments, including: [[sediment]] load assessment and inventory, conservation planning and design for [[sediment control]], and for the advancement of scientific understanding. The USLE or one of its derivatives are main models used by [[United States]] government agencies to measure water erosion.&lt;ref&gt;National Resources Conservation Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture. Washington, DC. {{USFR|61|27998}} "Technical Assistance." 1996-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

The USLE was developed in the U.S., based on soil erosion data collected beginning in the 1930s by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
([[USDA]]) Soil Conservation Service (now the USDA [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]]).&lt;ref&gt;Wischmeier, W.H. and D.D. Smith.  1978.

"A universal soil-loss equation to guide conservation farm planning." ''Trans. Int. Congr. Soil Sci.,'' 7th, p. 418-425.&lt;/ref&gt; The model has been used for decades for purposes of conservation planning both in the United States where it originated and around the world, and has been used to help implement the United States' multibillion-dollar conservation program.

==Overview of erosion models==
The two primary types of erosion models are process-based models and [[empirical model|empirically]] based models.  Process-based (physically based) models mathematically describe the erosion processes of detachment, transport, and [[Deposition (chemistry)|deposition]] and through the solutions of the equations describing those processes provide estimates of [[soil loss]] and [[sediment yield]]s from specified land surface areas.  Erosion science is not sufficiently advanced for there to exist completely process-based models which do not include empirical aspects.  The primary indicator, perhaps, for differentiating process-based from other types of erosion models is the use of the sediment continuity equation discussed below.  Empirical models relate management and environmental factors directly to soil loss and/or sedimentary yields through statistical relationships.  Lane et al.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, L.J., E.D. Shirley, and V.P. Singh. 1988. "Modeling erosion on hillslopes." p.287-308. In: M.G. Anderson (ed.) "Modeling Geomorphological Systems." John Wiley, Publ., NY.&lt;/ref&gt; provided a detailed discussion regarding the nature of process-based and empirical erosion models, as well as a discussion of what they termed [[conceptual model]]s, which lie somewhere between the process-based and purely empirical models.  Current research effort involving erosion modeling is weighted toward the development of process-based erosion models.  On the other hand, the standard model for most erosion assessment and conservation planning is the empirically based USLE, and there continues to be active research and development of USLE-based [[erosion prediction]] technology.

==Description of USLE==
The USLE was developed from erosion plot and rainfall simulator experiments.  The USLE is composed of six factors to predict the long-term average annual soil loss (A).  The equation includes the [[rainfall]] erosivity factor (R), the soil [[erodibility]] factor (K), the [[topographic]] factors (L and S) and the cropping management factors (C and P).  The equation takes the simple product form:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = R K L S C P&lt;/math&gt;
The USLE has another concept of experimental importance, the unit plot concept.  The unit plot is defined as the standard plot condition to determine the soil's [[erodibility]].  These conditions are when the LS factor = 1 (slope = 9% and length = 72.6 feet) where the plot is [[fallow]] and [[tillage]] is up and down slope and no conservation practices are applied (CP=1).  In this state:&lt;br /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;K = A/R&lt;/math&gt;
A simpler method to predict K was presented by Wischmeier et al.&lt;ref&gt;Wischmeier, W.H., C.B. Johnson, and B.V. Cross. 1971. "A soil erodibility nomograph for farmland and construction sites."  ''[[Journal of Soil and Water Conservation]]'' 26:189-193. {{issn|1941-3300}}&lt;/ref&gt; which includes the particle size of the soil, organic matter content, soil structure and profile permeability.  The soil erodibility factor K can be approximated from a [[nomograph]] if this information is known.  The LS factors can easily be determined from a slope effect chart by knowing the length and gradient of the slope.  The cropping management factor (C) and conservation practices factor (P) are more difficult to obtain and must be determined empirically from plot data.  They are described in soil loss ratios (C or P with / C or P without).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8915">The '''Whiteshell Laboratories''', originally known as the '''Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment''', was an [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited|Atomic Energy of Canada]] (AECL) laboratory in [[Manitoba]], northeast of [[Winnipeg]]. It was originally built as a home for the experimental [[WR-1]] reactor, but over time came to host a variety of experimental systems, including a [[SLOWPOKE reactor]] and the [[Underground Research Laboratory]] to study [[nuclear waste]] disposal. Employment peaked in the early 1970s at about 1,300, but during the 1980s the experiments began to wind down, and in 2003 the decision was made to close the site. {{Asof|2017}} the site is undergoing decommissioning with a planned completion date in 2024.

==History==
In the late 1950s, [[Atomic Energy Canada Limited]] (AECL) was planning an aggressive expansion of their experimental reactor designs. Among a number of proposals were versions of the [[heavy water reactor]] concept using alternate cooling arrangements including [[oil]] and boiling water. Their existing research site at the [[Chalk River Laboratories]] outside [[Ottawa]] appeared to be "at saturation" and too small to host all the planned experiments.{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=2}}

Considering their options, it was noted that only three provinces did not already host some sort of major federal lab, [[Newfoundland]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]]. Newfoundland was eliminated, and Alberta already had an oil and gas industry and did not need more energy experiments. So, the decision was made to build in Manitoba. A preliminary site survey was carried out by Shawinigan Engineering (later part of [[Lavalin]], today part of [[SNC-Lavalin]]). This was followed by meetings between AECL president J.L. Gray and Manitoba premier [[Dufferin Roblin]].{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=4}}

In November 1959, Gray reported to the AECL board that a site on the [[Winnipeg River]] near the [[Seven Sisters Generating Station]] appeared to be suitable, along with a report from the federal government's housing agency that a new town site could be developed nearby. As the town was on the border of the [[Whiteshell Provincial Park]], they named the lab Whiteshell.{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=5}} Manitoba was responsible for building a new bridge over the Winnipeg River and maintaining roads and other services. The town was developed as [[Pinawa]], some distance to the southeast of the lab site.{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=4}}

A deal was signed on 21 July 1960, creating the Whiteshell Nuclear Research Establishment (WNRE).{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=4}} The site was selected to host the Organic-Cooled Deuterium-Reactor Experiment (OCDRE),{{sfn|Saunders|2016|p=2}} which later became known as [[WR-1]]. The design needed to be ready for construction to start in April 1962. General Electric Canada built the reactor over a period of three years ending in June 1965, and the reactor achieved criticality on 1 November 1965. The idea of an oil-cooled version of the [[CANDU]] was eventually abandoned in 1972, and from then on the WR-1 was operated at low power settings in a purely experimental program.

Whiteshell led the development of the [[SLOWPOKE reactor]], starting in 1967. However, the first example, SLOWPOKE-1, was built at Chalk River and reached criticality in 1970. Over the next decade, several SLOWPOKE-2 reactors were sold around the world. A larger version, SLOWPOKE-3, was designed to supply 10,000&amp;nbsp;kW of hot water for [[district heating]]. The SLOWPOKE Demonstration Reactor (SDR) was built at Whiteshell in the early 1980s to test this concept. The project was terminated after market interest in a nuclear heating system dwindled. Other major facilities included shielded hot cell facilities, research laboratories and radioactive waste management areas including the Whiteshell Used Fuel Storage Facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://nuclearsafety.gc.ca/eng/mycommunity/facilities/pinawawhiteshell/ |accessdate=2012-07-26 |title=Whiteshell labs |publisher=[[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, AECL began an extensive program in [[nuclear waste]] disposal. Their general program would involve burial to shield the fuel for about three hundred years while the majority of the [[gamma ray]] sources burned out, followed by a much longer period of physical isolation, not necessarily underground, to ensure the remaining radionuclides did not enter the water supply. AECL eventually decided the entire waste storage period should be underground. They found a suitable test site in [[Canadian Shield]] rock about 50&amp;nbsp;km northwest of the main Whiteshell site. This led to the construction of the [[Underground Research Laboratory]] (URL) whose primary concern was measuring the stability of hard-rock burial and potential groundwater exchange. The facility was decommissioned and deliberately flooded in 2010 to perform one final experiment to examine how mine seals work in a water environment.&lt;ref name="freepress"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/breakingnews/whiteshell-labs-closes-underground-facility-forever-111511344.html|date=December 8, 2010|accessdate=October 11, 2014|title=Whiteshell labs closes underground facility forever |work=[[Winnipeg Free Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other programs on the main site included the '''Containment Test Facility''' (CTF) that examined potential [[hydrogen]] explosion sources in the CANDU reactors, and the '''Large-Scale Vented Combustion Test Facility''' (LSVCTF) that examined the actual explosions. Work at these sites concluded that by following some basic precautions the possibility of such an explosion in a CANDU was remote, and was used to test the '''[[Passive autocatalytic recombiner|Passive Autocatalytic Recombiners]]''' (PAR) system developed to scavage trace amounts of hydrogen that might be present. The PAR would go on to be a successful export product for AECL.

Starting in 1984, Whiteshell began a collaboration with [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] (LANL) to develop a [[nuclear battery]] for powering the [[North Warning System]] radars. This developed into an active generator using an [[Organic Rankine cycle]] generator.

Whiteshell ran a number of life sciences programs over the years. In 1966, two 19&amp;nbsp;m diameter plastic-lined "ponds" were built, one of which held a cesium-137 source. The ten-year program measured the spread of the caesium in the water, and by comparing the two ponds, its effect on the life forms in them. In 1973 they constructed the Field Irradiator Gamma (FIG) experiment, which fenced off a 1&amp;nbsp;km area of forest and exposed it to a powerful cesium-137 [[gamma radiation]] source in a central tower. The program ran until 1986, and concluded that it required 100,000 times the natural background to kill pine trees. A similar experiment started the next year in 1974, the ZEUS (Zoological Environment Under Stress) experiment, which set aside six 1-hectare meadow areas in 1974 and carried out long-term radioactive releases to measure the results. They were mostly interested in the effects on [[meadow vole]]s, but did not reach any conclusions.

In 1998, AECL decided to close Whiteshell Laboratories and many of the facilities and activities have since ceased active operation. {{asof|2017}}, many of the original facilities are shut down, but work on WR-1 is ongoing. The site is planned to be entirely decomiisioned by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnl.ca/en/home/environmental-stewardship/whiteshell/default.aspx |title= Whiteshell Decommissioning |website=Canadian Nuclear Laboratories}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World history''' or '''global history''' (not to be confused with [[diplomatic history|diplomatic]], [[transnational history|transnational]] or international history) is a field of [[historiography|historical study]] that emerged as a distinct academic field in the 1980s. It examines [[history]] from a global perspective. It is not to be confused with [[comparative history]], which, like world history, deals with the history of multiple cultures and nations, but does not do so on a global scale.  World history looks for common [[pattern]]s that emerge across all cultures. World historians use a [[theme (literature)|thematic]] approach, with two major focal points: [[syncretism|integration]] (how processes of world history have drawn people of the world together) and difference (how [[pattern]]s of world history reveal the diversity of the human experiences).&lt;ref&gt;J. Laurence Hare, and Jack Wells, "Promising the World: Surveys, Curricula, and the Challenge of Global History," ''History Teacher,'' 48 (Feb. 2015) pp: 371-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bentley has observed that 'the term ''world history'' has never been a clear signifier with a stable referent', and that usage of the term overlaps with [[universal history]], [[comparative history]], [[global history]], [[big history]], [[macro history]], and [[transnational history]], amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of world history as a distinct academic field of study can be traced to the 1960s, but the pace quickened in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H. Bentley, 'The Task of World History', in ''[http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.001.0001 The Oxford Handbook of World History]'', ed. by Jerry H. Bentley (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2011), pp. 1-14, {{DOI|10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199235810.013.0001}} (p. 2).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gran2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Gran|title=The Rise of the Rich: A New View of Modern World History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOv-dewXZi4C|accessdate=25 May 2012|date=28 February 2009|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-3171-2|page=XVI}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key step was the creation of the World History Association and graduate programs at a handful of universities. Over the next decades scholarly publications, professional and academic organizations, and graduate programs in World History proliferated. World History has often displaced Western Civilization in the required curriculum of American high schools and universities, and is supported by new textbooks with a world history approach.

World History attempts to recognise and address two structures that have profoundly shaped professional history-writing:
# A tendency to use current [[nation-states]] to the set the boundaries and agendas of studies of the past.
# A deep legacy of [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] assumptions (found especially, but not only, in Western history-writing).
Thus World History tends to study networks, connections, and systems that cross traditional boundaries of historical study like linguistic, cultural, and national borders. World History is often concerned to explore social dynamics that have led to large-scale changes in human society, such as [[industrialisation]] and the spread of [[capitalism]], and to analyse how large-scale changes like these have affected different parts of the world. Like other branches of history-writing in the second half of the twentieth century, World History has a scope far beyond historians' traditional focus on politics, wars, and diplomacy, taking in a panoply of subjects like [[gender history]], [[social history]], [[cultural history]], and [[environmental history]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry H.

==History==

===Pre-modern===
The study of world history, as distinct from national history, has existed in many world cultures. However, early forms of world history were not truly global, and were limited to only the regions known by the historian.

In [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], Chinese world history, that of China and the surrounding people of [[East Asia]], was based on the [[dynastic cycle]] articulated by [[Sima Qian]] in circa 100 BC. Sima Qian's model is based on the [[Mandate of Heaven]]. Rulers rise when they united China, then are overthrown when a ruling dynasty became corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Sima Qian, ''Records of the Grand Historian: Qin Dynasty'' (3rd ed. 1995) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0231081693 excerpt and text search]; Burton Watson, ''Ssu-ma Ch'ien: Grand Historian of China'' (1958)&lt;/ref&gt; Each new dynasty begins virtuous and strong, but then decays, provoking the transfer of Heaven's mandate to a new ruler. The test of virtue in a new dynasty is success in being obeyed by China and neighboring barbarians. After 2000 years Sima Qian's model still dominates scholarship, although the [[dynastic cycle]] is no longer used for modern Chinese history.&lt;ref&gt;S. Y. Teng, "Chinese Historiography in the Last Fifty Years," ''The Far Eastern Quarterly,'' Vol. 8, No. 2 (Feb., 1949), pp. 131–156 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2049138 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ancient Greece]], [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), as founder of Greek historiography,&lt;ref&gt;K.H. Waters, ''Herodotus the Historian'' (1985)&lt;/ref&gt; presents insightful and lively discussions of the customs, geography, and history of Mediterranean peoples, particularly the Egyptians. However, his great rival [[Thucydides]] promptly discarded Herodotus's all-embracing approach to history, offering instead a more precise, sharply focused monograph, dealing not with vast empires over the centuries but with 27 years of war between Athens and Sparta. In Rome, the vast, patriotic history of Rome by Livy (59 BC-17 AD) approximated Herodotean inclusiveness;&lt;ref&gt;Patrick G. Walsh, ''Livy: His Historical Aims and Methods'' (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Polybius (c.200-c.118 BC) aspired to combine the logical rigor of Thucydides with the scope of Herodotus.&lt;ref&gt;Frank W. Walbank, ''A Historical Commentary on Polybius,'' (3 vols. 1957–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Asia, [[The Secret History of Mongols]] is regarded as the single significant native Mongolian account of Genghis Khan. The Secret History is regarded as a piece of classic literature in both Mongolia and the rest of the world.

In the Middle East, [[Ala'iddin Ata-Malik Juvayni]] (1226–1283) was a Persian historian who wrote an account of the Mongol Empire entitled Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā (History of the World Conqueror).&lt;ref&gt;History of the World Conqueror by Ala Ad Din Ata Malik Juvaini, translated by John Andrew Boyle, Harvard University Press 1958, Project Gutenberg on line edition&lt;/ref&gt; The standard edition of Juvayni is published under the title Ta' rīkh-i jahān-gushā, ed. Mirza Muhammad Qazwini, 3 vol, Gibb Memorial Series 16 (Leiden and London, 1912–37). An English translation by John Andrew Boyle "The History of the World-Conqueror" was republished in 1997.

[[Rashīd al-Dīn Fadhl-allāh Hamadānī]] (1247–1318), was a Persian physician of Jewish origin, polymathic writer and historian, who wrote an enormous Islamic history, the Jami al-Tawarikh, in the Persian language, often considered a landmark in intercultural historiography and a key document on the Ilkhanids (13th and 14th century).&lt;ref&gt;Elliot, H. M. (Henry Miers), Sir; John Dowson. "10. Jámi'u-t Tawáríkh, of Rashid-al-Din". [[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians]]. The Muhammadan Period (Vol 3.). London : Trübner &amp; Co.. https://archive.org/stream/cu31924073036737#page/n15/mode/2up.&lt;/ref&gt; His encyclopedic knowledge of a wide range of cultures from Mongolia to China to the Steppes of Central Eurasia to Persia, the Arabic-speaking lands, and Europe, provide the most direct access to information on the late Mongol era. His descriptions also highlight the manner in which the Mongol Empire and its emphasis on trade resulted in an atmosphere of cultural and religious exchange and intellectual ferment, resulting in the transmission of a host of ideas from East to West and vice versa.

One Muslim scholar, [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1409) broke with traditionalism and offered a model of historical change in ''Muqaddimah,'' an exposition of the methodology of scientific history. Ibn Khaldun focused on the reasons for the rise and fall of civilization, arguing that the causes of change are to be sought in the economic and social structure of society. His work was largely ignored in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khaldun, ''The Muqaddimah: An Introduction to History'' ed. by N. J. Dawood, Bruce Lawrence, and Franz Rosenthal (2004) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0691120544 excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise the Muslim, Chinese and Indian intellectuals held fast to a religious traditionalism, leaving them unprepared to advise national leaders on how to confront the European intrusion into Asia after 1500 AD.

===Early modern===
During the [[Renaissance]] in Europe, history was written about states or nations. The study of history changed during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and [[Romanticism]]. [[Voltaire]] described the history of certain ages that he considered important, rather than describing events in chronological order. History became an independent discipline. It was not called ''philosophia historiae'' anymore, but merely history (''historia'').Voltaire, in the 18th century, attempted to revolutionize the study of world history. First, Voltaire concluded that the traditional study of history was flawed. The Christian Church, one of the most powerful entities in his time, had presented a framework for studying history. Voltaire, when writing ''History of Charles XII'' (1731) and ''The Age of Louis XIV'' (1751), instead choose to focus economics, politics and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/voltaire-9520178|title=Voltaire|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These aspects of history were mostly unexplored by his contemporaries and would each develop into their own sections of world history. Above all else, Voltaire regarded truth as the most essential part of recording world history. Nationalism and religion only subtracted from objective truth, so Voltaire freed himself for their influence when he recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Shank|first=J.B.|title=Voltaire|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/voltaire/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giambattista Vico]] (1668–1744) in Italy wrote ''Scienza nuva seconda'' (The New Science) in 1725, which argued history as the expression of human will and deeds.  He thought that men are historical entities and that human nature changes over time. Each epoch should be seen as a whole in which all aspects of culture—art, religion, philosophy, politics, and economics—are interrelated (a point developed later by [[Oswald Spengler]]). Vico showed that myth, poetry, and art are entry points to discovering the true spirit of a culture. Vico outlined a conception of historical development in which great cultures, like Rome, undergo cycles of growth and decline.  His ideas were out of fashion during the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], but influenced the Romantic historians after 1800.

A major theoretical foundation for world history was given by German philosopher [[G. W. F. Hegel]], who saw the modern Prussian state as the latest (though often confused with the highest) stage of world development.

G.W.F. Hegel developed three lenses through which he believed world history could be viewed. Documents produced during a historical period, such as journal entries and contractual agreements, were considered by Hegel to be part of Original History. These documents are produced by a person enveloped within a culture, making them conduits of vital information but also limited in their contextual knowledge. Documents which pertain to Hegel’s Original History are classified by modern historians as primary sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Little|first=Daniel|title=Philosophy of History|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/history/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflective History, Hegel’s second lens, are documents written with some temporal distance separating the event which is discussed in the academic writing. What limited this lens, according to Hegel, was the imposition of the writers own cultural values and views on the historical event. This criticism of Reflective History was later formalized by Anthropologists Franz Boa and coined as Cultural relativism by Alain Locke. Both of these lenses were considered to be partially flawed by Hegel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Soul and the Body in Hegel's Anthropology|last=Nicholas|first=Mowad|publisher=Loyola University Chicago|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hegel termed the lens which he advocated to view world history through as Philosophical History.  In order to view history through this lens, one must analyze events, civilizations, and periods objectively. When done in this fashion, the historian can then extract the prevailing theme from their studies. This lens differs from the rest because it is void of any cultural biases and takes a more analytical approach to history. World History can be a broad topic, so focusing on extracting the most valuable information from certain periods may be the most beneficial approach. This third lens, as did Hegel’s definitions of the other two, affected the study of history in the early modern period and our contemporary period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCabe|first=David|title=Hegel and the Idea of Philosophical History|jstor=27744789|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=15|issue=3|pages=369–388|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early modern historian was Adam Ferguson. Ferguson’s main contribution to the study of world history was his ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society'' (1767).&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Adam. ''An Essay on the History of Civil Society. (1767).''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ferguson, world history was a combination of two forms of history. One was natural history; the aspects of our world which god created. The other, which was more revolutionary, was social history. For him, social history was the progress humans made towards fulfilling God’s plan for humanity. He believed that progress, which could be achieved through individuals pursuing commercial success, would bring us closer to a perfect society; but we would never reach one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TEE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY OF ADAM FERGUSON A COMMENTARY CN HIS ESSAY CK THE HISTORY OF CIVIL SOCIETY|last=Hamowy|first=Ronald|publisher=The University of Chicago|year=1969|isbn=|location=Chicago, Illinois|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also theorized that a complete dedication to commercial success could lead to societal collapse—like what happened in Rome—because people would lose morality. Through this lens, Ferguson viewed world history as humanities struggle to reach an ideal society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.d.umn.edu/cla/faculty/jhamlin/4111/Ferguson/Adam%20Ferguson.htm|title=Adam Ferguson|website=www.d.umn.edu|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Home, Lord Kames was a philosopher during the Enlightenment and contributed to the study or world history. In his major historical work, ''Sketches on the History of Man'', Home’s outlined the four stages of human history which he observed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hetwebsite.net/het/profiles/kames.htm|title=Henry Home, Lord Kames|website=www.hetwebsite.net|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first and most primitive stage was small hunter-gatherer groups. Then, in order to form larger groups, humans transitioned into the second stage when they began to domesticate animals. The third stage was the development of agriculture. This new technology established trade and higher levels of cooperation amongst sizable groups of people. With the gathering of people into agricultural villages, laws and social obligations needed to be developed so a form of order could be maintained. The fourth, and final stage, involved humans moving into market towns and seaports where agriculture was not the focus. Instead, commerce and other forms of labor arouse in a society. By defining the stages of human history, Homes influenced his successors. He also contributed to the development of other studies such as sociology and anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/kames-on-progress-and-providence|title=Kames on Progress and Providence  - Online Library of Liberty|website=oll.libertyfund.org|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
World history became a popular genre in the 20th century with [[universal history]]. In the 1920s, several best-sellers dealt with the history of the world, including surveys ''[[The Story of Mankind]]'' (1921) by [[Hendrik Willem van Loon]] and ''[[The Outline of History]]'' (1918) by [[H.G. Wells]]. Influential writers who have reached wide audiences include [[H. G. Wells]], [[Oswald Spengler]], [[Arnold J. Toynbee]], [[Pitirim Sorokin]], [[Carroll Quigley]], [[Christopher Dawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Bradley J. Birzer, ''Sanctifying the World: The Augustinian Life and Mind of Christopher Dawson'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Scholars working the field include [[Eric Voegelin]],&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Federici, ''Eric Voegelin: The Restoration of Order'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hardy McNeill]] and [[Michael Mann (sociologist)|Michael Mann]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Mann, ''The Sources of Social Power: Volume 1, A History of Power from the Beginning to AD 1760'' (1986) [https://www.amazon.com/dp/052131349X excerpt and text search]&lt;/ref&gt; With evolving technologies such as dating methods and surveying laser technology called LiDAR, contemporary historians have access to knew information which changes how past civilizations are studied.

[[Oswald Spengler|Spengler's]] ''Decline of the West'' (2 vol 1919–1922) compared nine organic cultures: Egyptian (3400 BC-1200 BC), Indian (1500 BC-1100 BC), Chinese (1300 BC-AD 200), Classical (1100 BC-400 BC), Byzantine (AD 300–1100), Aztec (AD 1300–1500), Arabian (AD 300–1250), Mayan (AD 600–960), and Western (AD 900–1900). His book was a smashing success among intellectuals worldwide as it predicted the disintegration of European and American civilization after a violent "age of Caesarism," arguing by detailed analogies with other civilizations. It deepened the post-World War I pessimism in Europe, and was warmly received by intellectuals in China, India, and Latin America who hoped his predictions of the collapse of European empires would soon come true.&lt;ref&gt;Neil McInnes, "The Great Doomsayer: Oswald Spengler Reconsidered." ''National Interest'' 1997 (48): 65–76. Fulltext: [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936–1954, [[Arnold J. Toynbee|Toynbee's]] ten-volume ''A Study of History'' came out in three separate installments. He followed Spengler in taking a comparative topical approach to independent civilizations. Toynbee said they displayed striking parallels in their origin, growth, and decay. Toynbee rejected Spengler's biological model of civilizations as organisms with a typical life span of 1,000 years. Like [[Sima Qian]], Toynbee explained decline as due to their moral failure. Many readers rejoiced in his implication (in vols. 1–6) that only a return to some form of Catholicism could halt the breakdown of western civilization which began with the Reformation. Volumes 7–10, published in 1954, abandoned the religious message, and his popular audience slipped away, while scholars  picked apart his mistakes.,&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, ''Arnold J. Toynbee a Life'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hardy McNeill|McNeill]] wrote ''[[The Rise of the West]]'' (1963) to improve upon Toynbee by showing how the separate civilizations of Eurasia interacted from the very beginning of their history, borrowing critical skills from one another, and thus precipitating still further change as adjustment between traditional old and borrowed new knowledge and practice became necessary. McNeill took a broad approach organized around the interactions of peoples across the Earth. Such interactions have become both more numerous and more continual and substantial in recent times. Before about 1500, the network of communication between cultures was that of Eurasia. The term for these areas of interaction differ from one world historian to another and include ''world-system'' and ''ecumene.''  Whatever it is called, the importance of these intercultural contacts has begun to be recognized by many scholars.&lt;ref&gt;William H. McNeill, "The Changing Shape of World History." ''History and Theory'' 1995 34(2): 8–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History education==

===United States===
[[T. Walter Wallbank]] and [[Alastair M. Taylor]] co-authored ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'', the first world-history textbook published in the United States (1942). With additional authors, this very successful work went through numerous editions up to the first decade of the twenty-first century. According to the Golden Anniversary edition of 1992, the ongoing objective of ''Civilization Past &amp; Present'' "was to present a survey of world cultural history, treating the development and growth of civilization not as a unique European experience but as a global one through which all the great culture systems have interacted to produce the present-day world. It attempted to include all the elements of history – social, economic, political, religious, aesthetic, legal, and technological."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization Past &amp; Present|last=Wallbank|first=T. Walter, et al.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1992|isbn=978-0-673-38867-4|location=New York|pages=xxv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In college curricula of the United States, world history became a popular replacement for courses on [[Western Civilization]]. Professors [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], previously of Northeastern University and now at the University of Pittsburgh's World History Center; and [[Ross E. Dunn]] at San Diego State are leaders in promoting innovative teaching methods.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Manning, ''Navigating World History: Historians Create a Global Past'' (2003); [[Ross E. Dunn]], ed., ''The New World History: A Teacher's Companion.'' (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

In schools of architecture in the U.S., the [[National Architectural Accrediting Board]] now requires that schools teach history that includes a non-west or global perspective. This reflects a decade-long effort to move past the standard Euro-centric approach that had dominated the field.&lt;ref&gt;See Points 8 and 9. http://www.naab.org/adaview.aspx?pageid=120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent themes==
In recent years, the relationship between African and world history has shifted rapidly from one of antipathy to one of engagement and synthesis. Reynolds (2007) surveys the relationship between African and world histories, with an emphasis on the tension between the area studies paradigm and the growing world-history emphasis on connections and exchange across regional boundaries. A closer examination of recent exchanges and debates over the merits of this exchange is also featured. Reynolds sees the relationship between African and world history as a measure of the changing nature of historical inquiry over the past century.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan T. Reynolds, "Africa and World History: from Antipathy to Synergy." ''History Compass'' 2007 5(6): 1998–2013. ISSN 1478-0542 Fulltext: [1. History Compass]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marxian theory of history==
{{Main|Marx's theory of history#The stages of history }}

The [[Marxist theory]] of [[historical materialism]] claims the history of the world is fundamentally determined by the ''material conditions'' at any given time&amp;nbsp;– in other words, the relationships which people have with each other in order to fulfil basic needs such as feeding, clothing and housing themselves and their families.&lt;ref&gt;See, in particular, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ Marx and Engels, ''The German Ideology'']&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, [[Karl Marx|Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels|Engels]] claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in [[Western Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Marx makes no claim to have produced a master key to history. Historical materialism is not "an historico-philosophic theory of the marche generale imposed by fate upon every people, whatever the historic circumstances in which it finds itself" (Marx, Karl: Letter to editor of the Russian paper ''Otetchestvennye Zapiskym'', 1877). His ideas, he explains, are based on a concrete study of the actual conditions that pertained in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory divides the history of the world into the following periods:&lt;ref&gt;Marx, ''Early writings'', Penguin, 1975, p. 426.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Charles Taylor 1980 p. 330"&gt;Charles Taylor, “Critical Notice”, ''Canadian Journal of Philosophy'' 10 (1980), p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705120509/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Critique of the Gotha Programme'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=civilwar&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030705030211/http://www.marx.org/archive/marx/works/1871/civil-war-france/index.htm Marx and Engels, ''The Civil War in France'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
