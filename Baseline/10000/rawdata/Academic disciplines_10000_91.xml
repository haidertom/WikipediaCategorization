In [[computing]], ''' 10-foot user interface''' ("10-foot UI") is a [[graphical user interface]] designed for [[television]]s. Compared to [[desktop computer]] and [[smartphone]] user interfaces, it uses text and other interface elements which are much larger in order to accommodate a typical television viewing distance of 10 feet (3 meters). Additionally, the limitations of a television's [[remote control]] necessitate extra [[User experience design|user experience]] considerations to minimize user effort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/MIX/MIX06/BTB029 The Digital Home: Designing for the Ten-Foot User Interface]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://download.intel.com/support/motherboards/desktop/sb/nuci3hometheatersolutionguide_v02.pdf Intel Next Unit of Computing Driving your 10 foot experience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.easyclasspage.de/mac/seite-16.html 10 foot Style / Graphical User Interface (GUI) for Growl]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
The term "10-foot" is used to differentiate this user interface style from those used on desktop computers, which typically assume the user's eyes are only about two feet (60 cm) from the display. This difference in distance from the display has a huge impact on the interface design, requiring the use of extra large fonts on a television and allowing relatively few items to be shown on a television at once.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia_term/0,2542,t=10-foot+user+interface&amp;i=36892,00.asp#fbid=8WN9yzOrfhM PC Magazine Definition of: 10-foot user interface]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[https://developer.android.com/design/tv/style.html Style for TV]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.nvidia.com/android-tv-developer-guide Android TV Developer Guide (Nvidia)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 10 foot UI is almost always designed to be operated by a simple hand-held remote control. Rather than the [[Computer mouse|mouse]] or [[touchscreen]] which are commonly used with other types of user interfaces, the remote's [[D-pad|directional pad]] is the primary means of navigation. This means that a 10-foot UI needs to arrange items on screen in a way that clearly shows which item would be next in each of the four directions of the directional pad - usually a grid layout. Also, without a mouse cursor, the currently-selected item must be highlighted in some way.

Ten-foot interfaces may resemble other [[post-WIMP]] systems graphically, due to a similar paucity of pixels, but do not assume the use of a [[touch screen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avermedia.com/avertv/upload/avermediatvsoftware/index.html AVerMedia TV Software]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://appdevconf.engagedigital.com/sessions/keys-to-successfully-building-a-10-ft-ui/# |title=Building a 10 Foot UI: Dealing With Platform Diversity |access-date=2011-11-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114121831/http://appdevconf.engagedigital.com/sessions/keys-to-successfully-building-a-10-ft-ui/# |archive-date=2011-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of 10 foot user interface design is normally to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible, trying to achieve a more laid-back and relaxed user experience with as few button presses as possible while still having an intuitive layout, in terms of accomplishing user goals&amp;mdash;what is often called [[user-centered design]]. Good user interface design facilitates finishing the task at hand without drawing unnecessary attention to itself. [[Graphic design]] may be utilized to support its [[usability]]; however, the design process must balance technical functionality and visual elements (e.g., [[mental model]]) to create a system that is not only operational but also usable and adaptable to changing user needs.&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.android.com/design/tv/index.html Designing for Android TV&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-10-foot-home-TV-experience-so-hard-to-get-right Why is the "10 foot" home TV experience so hard to get right?&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://developer.android.com/training/tv/index.html Building Apps for TV&lt;/ref&gt;

The AES coarse-groove calibration discs (AES-S001-064) are a boxed set of two identical discs, one for routine use, one for master reference. The intent is to characterize the reproduction chain for the mass transfer of coarse-groove records to digital media, much like using a photographic calibration reference in image work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aes.org/standards/b_data/x064-rationale.cfm|title=AES Standards|website=www.aes.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Libraries]] and archives around the world have collections of many thousands of coarse-groove mechanical [[audio recordings]], [[phonograph]] or [[gramophone record]]s, largely 78s or 78 [[revolutions per minute]] (rpm) discs. This is a substantial recorded heritage of mankind's music and spoken word made over a period of 65 years. The 78 rpm disc was largely out of production by 1960. These mechanical recordings won't be available indefinitely since the plastics used in their manufacture are deteriorating slowly but steadily. Preservation programs have been underway by a number of organizations. Decreasing costs of digital storage media now make it possible to consider all mechanical audio recordings for transfer to the digital domain. Thus a widespread need was recognized by the [[Audio Engineering Society]] (AES) to provide a calibration tool for standard transfer of mechanical coarse-groove audio recordings from the analog to the digital domain.&lt;ref&gt;Audio Engineering Society Standards Committee, AES 78 rpm Calibration Disc Set (last updated 2007-07-20).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specifications==

==A Closer Look At The Preservation Problem==
According to [[Ted Kendall]], maker of the Front End audio restoration unit also known as "The Mousetrap", the equalization time constants for post-1955 78s used in the Front End are 3180/450/50 ms.&lt;ref&gt;Kendall, Ted. The Front End-EQ Settings, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; These time constants are identical to those used in the AES Coarse-groove Calibration Discs. Since the 78 rpm record would be obsolete by 1960, this means that there is a very large population of pre-1955 78s requiring different equalization settings depending on the vintage and label of the disc.

:''Type of Recording: Equalizer Settings''
:Acoustic recordings (pre-1925): Flat/AC/AC
:FFRR 78s: Flat/636/25
:EMI 78s 1945-1955: Flat/636/Flat
:Most other UK 78s 1925-1945: Flat/531/Flat
:Post-1955 78s: 3180/450/50
:BBC direct recordings 1945-1960: Flat/BBC/BBC
:CCIR standard coarse-groove transcriptions: Flat/450/50
:AES (some early US Lps): Flat/400/63.6
:Modern LPs (RIAA equalization): 3180/318/75
:Lateral cut NAB transcriptions: 2250/250/100
:Vertical cut NAB transcriptions: Flat/531/40*
:Western Electric 78s: Flat 531/Flat*

:*Adjustments needed*

So, the dilemma is this: should coarse-groove recordings be transferred in mass to digital using an arbitrary phonoequalization curve such as with the AES calibration discs, or should each recording be matched to the curve appropriate to its vintage and label, then transferred to digital media?

==Use of RIAA Equalization==
Because the [[RIAA equalization]] standard has been in use internationally for phonograph records since 1953 and is based on recording practices used for many years by RCA Victor a dominant record producer, the electronics for this is as readily available as record players are. For vintage recordings the Esoteric Sound Re-Equalizer can readily be connected as a standard item to the record playback equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Esoteric Sound, 4813 Wallbank Ave., Downers Grove, Illinois 60515&lt;/ref&gt; The Re-Equalizer is used to modify RIAA. Then, depending on the vintage and label of the 78 rpm record, the appropriate equalizer bass turnover and treble [[rolloff]] settings can be easily looked up in a reference guide.&lt;ref&gt;Powell, James R., Jr. and Randall G. Stehle. Playback Equalizer Settings for 78 rpm Recordings. Third Edition. Gramophone Adventures, Portage, Michigan; 1993, 2002, 2007. {{ISBN|0-9634921-3-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Equipment==
Another approach to obtaining the right phonograph record equalization settings for transferring vintage recordings to digital media is to use the Chronologic Equalizer in the Souvenir Vintage Sound Processor – MK-2 made by K-A-B Electronics.&lt;ref&gt;K-A-B Electronics P. O. Box 2922, Plainfield, New Jersey 07062-0922&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Equalizer Setting''
:AC: Acoustic recordings
:AE: Early electric recordings; Victor (some 1925), Columbia (1925), and most European to 1955
:E3: Recordings with a 300 Hz turnover; Columbia (1925-1938), and FRR to 1955
:E5: Recordings with a 500 Hz turnover; Victor (most 1925-1952)
:E7: Recordings with a 700 Hz turnover (some NBC Orthacoustic transcriptions)
:CO: Columbia 78 curve (1938 to 1955)
:TR: Transcriptions (NAB)
:MO: RIAA equalization

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9935">The [[ethologist]] [[John B. Calhoun]] coined the term "'''behavioral sink'''" to describe the collapse in behavior which resulted from [[overcrowding]].  Over a number of years, Calhoun conducted over-population experiments on [[Norway rat]]s (in 1958&amp;ndash;1962) and [[mice]] (in 1968&amp;ndash;1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Calhoun coined the term "behavioral sink" in his February 1, 1962 report in an article titled ''Population Density and Social Pathology'' in ''Scientific American'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Population Density and Social Pathology|url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/population-density-and-social-patho/|website = Scientific American|accessdate = 2015-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the rat experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Calhoun's work became used as an animal model of [[societal collapse]], and his study has become a touchstone of [[urban sociology]] and [[psychology]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1962 study, Calhoun described the behavior as follows:

{{bquote|Many [female rats] were unable to carry pregnancy to full term or to survive delivery of their litters if they did. An even greater number, after successfully giving birth, fell short in their maternal functions. Among the males the behavior disturbances ranged from sexual deviation to cannibalism and from frenetic overactivity to a pathological withdrawal from which individuals would emerge to eat, drink and move about only when other members of the community were asleep. The social organization of the animals showed equal disruption. ...

The common source of these disturbances became most dramatically apparent in the populations of our first series of three experiments, in which we observed the development of what we called a behavioral sink. The animals would crowd together in greatest number in one of the four interconnecting pens in which the colony was maintained. As many as 60 of the 80 rats in each experimental population would assemble in one pen during periods of feeding. Individual rats would rarely eat except in the company of other rats. As a result extreme population densities developed in the pen adopted for eating, leaving the others with sparse populations.

... In the experiments in which the behavioral sink developed, infant mortality ran as high as 96 percent among the most disoriented groups in the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Calhoun would continue his experiments for many years, but the publication of the 1962 article put the concept in the public domain, where it took root in popular culture as an analogy for human behavior.

Calhoun retired from [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] in 1984, but continued to work on his research results until his death on September 7, 1995.&lt;ref name="NLM Announces the Public Release of the Papers of John B. Calhoun"&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/calhoun_papers_released.html NLM Announces the Public Release of the Papers of John B. Calhoun], U.S. National Library of Medicine, 2013-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The experiments ==
Calhoun's early experiments with rats were carried out on farmland at [[Rockville, Maryland]], starting in 1947.&lt;ref name=cabinet2011&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cabinetmagazine.org/issues/42/wiles.php|title=The Behavioral Sink|publisher=Cabinet Magazine|date=Summer 2011|accessdate=2012-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Calhoun was working at NIMH in 1954, he began numerous experiments with rats and mice. During his first tests, he placed around 32 to 56 rodents in a 10 x 14-foot case in a barn in Montgomery County. He separated the space into four rooms. Every room was specifically created to support a dozen matured brown Norwegian rats. Rats could maneuver between the rooms by using the ramps. Since Calhoun provided unlimited resources, such as water, food, and also protection from predators as well as from disease and weather, the rats were said to be in "rat utopia" or "mouse paradise", another psychologist explained.&lt;ref name="Medical Historian Examines NIMH Experiments in Crowding"&gt;[http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2008/07_25_2008/story1.htm Medical Historian Examines NIMH Experiments in Crowding] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327132421/http://nihrecord.od.nih.gov/newsletters/2008/07_25_2008/story1.htm |date=2013-03-27 }}, nih record, 2013-10-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his earlier experiments with rats, in 1972 Calhoun would later create his "Mortality-Inhibiting Environment for Mice": a 101-inch square cage for [[mice]] with food and water replenished to support any increase in population,&lt;ref name ="deathsquared"/&gt; which took his experimental approach to its limits. In his most famous experiment in the series, "Universe 25", population peaked at 2,200 mice and thereafter exhibited a variety of abnormal, often destructive behaviors. By the 600th day, the population was on its way to extinction.&lt;ref name=cabinet2011/&gt;

== Influence of the concept ==
{{expand section|date=August 2012}}
The 1962 ''Scientific American'' article came at a time at which [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]] had become a subject of great public interest, and had a considerable cultural influence.&lt;ref name=ramsdenadams2009&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was directly referenced in some works of fiction,&lt;ref name=ramsdenadams2009/&gt; and may have been an influence on many more.

Calhoun had phrased much of his work in [[anthropomorphic]] terms, in a way that made his ideas highly accessible to a lay audience.&lt;ref name=cabinet2011/&gt; [[Tom Wolfe]] wrote about the concept in his article "Oh Rotten Gotham! Sliding Down into the Behavioral Sink", later to be made into the last chapter of ''[[The Pump House Gang]]''.&lt;ref name=ramsdenadams2009/&gt; [[Lewis Mumford]] also referenced Calhoun's work in his ''[[The City in History]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Moore | first = Adam | title = Privacy rights moral and legal foundations | publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press | location = University Park, Pa | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0271036861 | page = 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating:

{{bquote|No small part of this ugly barbarization has been due to sheer physical congestion: a diagnosis now partly confirmed with scientific experiments with rats – for when they are placed in equally congested quarters, they exhibit the same symptoms of stress, alienation, hostility, sexual perversion, parental incompetence, and rabid violence that we now find in the Megalopolis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lewis Mumford]], ''[[The City in History]]'', 1961, p 210. cited in Theodore D. Fuller, et al. "Chronic Stress and Psychological Well-being: Evidence from Thailand on Household Crowding," Social Science Medicine, 42 (1996): 267&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Calhoun's work has been referenced in comic books, including ''[[Batman]]'' and ''[[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]]''.&lt;ref name=ramsdenadams2009/&gt;

Calhoun himself saw the fate of the population of mice as a metaphor for the potential fate of man. He characterized the social breakdown as a "spiritual death",&lt;ref name ="deathsquared"/&gt; with reference to bodily death as the "second death" mentioned in the [[Bible|Biblical]] book of {{Bibleverse||Revelation|2:11|NIV}}.&lt;ref name ="deathsquared"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calhoun's work with rats inspired the 1971 children's book, ''[[Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH]]'', by Robert C. O'Brien, which was adapted into a 1982 animated film, ''[[The Secret of NIMH]]''.&lt;ref name="NLM Announces the Public Release of the Papers of John B. Calhoun" /&gt;

== Rat to human comparison ==
Controversy exists over the implications of the experiment. Psychologist Jonathan Freedman's experiment recruited high school and university students to carry out a series of experiments that measured the effects of density on behavior. He measured their stress, discomfort, aggression, competitiveness, and general unpleasantness. He declared to have found no appreciable negative effects in 1975. Researchers argued that "Calhoun's work was not simply about density in a physical sense, as number of individuals-per-square-unit-area, but was about degrees of social interaction."&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, Carla.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5552">A '''binding site''' is a region on a [[protein]] to which signaling molecules called [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]]s may bind to induce a change in biological activity. Bonds formed at the binding site are [[Non-covalent interactions|noncovalent]] and transient so that the activated function may be easily regulated.

In this article, nucleic acid (NA) is meant both DNA and RNA,
both in any possible configuration (double-stranded (ds) /single-stranded (ss) /as a combination thereof, Long/Short, Circular/Liner,...).

[http://www.eurogentest.org/web/info/public/unit5/dna_extraction_validation.xhtml DNA Extraction Methods For Large Blood Volumes]&lt;/ref&gt;
from biological samples. Essential of this method is the use of silica beads, capable of binding the NA in the presence of a chaotropic substance according to the effect.
This method is one of the most widespread&lt;ref name=RAS/&gt;&lt;ref name="sms"/&gt; methods for isolating nucleic acids from biological samples and is known as a simple, rapid, and reliable&lt;ref name="Boom2"/&gt; method for the small-scale purification of NA from biological sample.

This method is said to have been developed and invented by [[Willem R. Boom]] et al. around 1990.&lt;ref group=notes name="Note1"&gt;
Estimated from priority date of Boom, et. al; US5234809 [http://www.google.com/patents/US5234809], EP0389063 [http://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?DB=worldwide.espacenet.com&amp;II=0&amp;ND=3&amp;adjacent=true&amp;locale=en_EP&amp;FT=D&amp;date=19900926&amp;CC=EP&amp;NR=0389063A2&amp;KC=A2] and their family patents.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the aforementioned chaotropic effect itself was already known and already reported by Vogelstein and Gillespie&lt;ref name=voge&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; before the development of the BOOM method.
So the contribution of Boom et al. may be the optimization of the method to complex starting materials,&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt; such as body fluids and other biological starting materials, and provides a short step procedure according to the Boom et al. US5234809.&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt; After the Boom et al.&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt; was filed,
similar applications&lt;ref name=BD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US5342931|title=US5342931|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.co.jp/patents/US5973138|title=US5973138 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hawkins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.co.jp/patents/US5705628|title=DNA purification and isolation using magnetic particles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; have also been filed by other parties.

In a narrow sense, the word "silica" meant SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystals; however, other forms of silica particles are available.
Especially amorphous silicon oxide and glass powder, alkylsilica, aluminum silicate ([[zeolite]]), or,  activated
silica with -NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are suitable as nucleic acid binding solid phase material according to this method.
Today, the embodyments of Boom method, characterized by "utilizing the magnetic beads (silica beads are magnetic beads)" is widely used. In such method, silica beads are captured by magnetic beads collector, such as Tajima pipette,&lt;ref name="Tajima"&gt;

==Brief procedure==
[[File:Boom method by Tajima pipet.jpg|thumb|Fig. 1: Boom method by Tajima pipette and magnetic silica beads.&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; Schematic structure of Tajima pipette are shown in Fig. 2. Apparatus and methods&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; are mainly intended to the immune system.

[[File:Tajima pipet.jpg|thumb|Fig. 2:Schematic structure of Tajima pipette.]]

The process for isolating nucleic acid from starting material of Boom method are essentially consist of following 4 steps&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boom2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP2"/&gt; (See Fig. 1).

&lt;blockquote&gt;
(a) '''Lysing and/or Homogenizing''' the starting material.&lt;br&gt;
Lysate of starting material is obtained by for example a detergent
in the presence of protein degrading enzymes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(b) '''Mixing''' chaotropic substance and silica beads into the starting material.&lt;br&gt;
'''Mixing the Starting material''', a chaotropic substance to bind the NA to silica beads, lysate of starting material of (a)  is mixed with sufficiently large amounts of chaotropic substance.
According to the chaotropic effect, releasing-NA will be bound to
the silica beads almost instantaneously. In this way, silica-nucleic
acid complexes are formed. The reasons why NA and silica form
bonds are to be described in the following section (Basic principles).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

(c) '''Washing silica beads''' &lt;br&gt;
In this step, silica beads of (b) are washed several times to remove contaminants.
Process of washing of the silica-nucleic acid complexes (silica beads) typically consists of following steps,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
*Collecting silica beads from the liquid by for example Tajima pipette (see Fig. 1,2) or by for example Pellet-down (by rapid sedimentation (centrifugation) and disposal of the supernatant (e.g., bysuction))
*Redispersioning silica beads into the chaotropic salt-containing washing buffer using, e. g., a vortex mixer.
*Collecting redispersed silica beads from above mentioned washing buffer again.
*Further washed successively with an alcohol-water solution&lt;ref group=notes&gt;According original method by Boom, most preferably about 70% ethanol to restrict losses in yield&lt;/ref&gt; and with acetone.
*Drying beads are preferably be done.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

(d)'''Separating the bonded nucleic acids''' &lt;br&gt;
Separating the bonded nucleic acids from the silica beads. Pure NA are eluted into buffer by decreasing the concentration of chaotropic substance.
NA presented in the washed (and preferably dried) silica-nucleic
acid complexes is eluted into elution buffer such as TE buffer,
aqua bidest, ... , and so on. The selection of the elution buffer is
co-determined by the contemplated use of the isolated NA.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this way, pure NA are isolated from the starting material.

By the alteration of the experimental condition, especially by alteration of the composition of [[reagents]] (chaotropic substance, wash buffer, and so on) we can realize more specific isolation. For example, some composition of reagents are suitable for obtaining long ds DNA, some composition of reagents are suitable for short ss RNA, and so on.

Starting material are for example, [[whole blood]], [[blood serum]], [[buffy coat]], [[urine]], [[feces]], [[cerebrospinal fluid]], [[sperm]], [[saliva]], [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]], [[cell cultures]], [[food products]], [[vaccines]]. and..., so various Starting biological material are available.

Of cause optimization of procedure according to the starting material, species of desired nucleic acid (DNA/RNA, Linear/ circular, ds/ss, long/short) are required.

Today, the assay characterized by using silica coated magnetic beads seems to be the most common. Therefore, in this article, "silica beads" are intended to mean silica coated magnetic beads unless stated otherwise.

The silica coated beads&lt;ref name=hitachi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US20040126902|title=Magnetic carrier for biological substance, production method thereof and isolation method of biological substance using same|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US7119194&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7119194|title=Nucleic acid-bondable magnetic carrier and method for isolating nucleic acid using the same|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Promega&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6368800|title=Kits for isolating biological target materials using silica magnetic particles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; coated various magnetic particles (magnetic carrier) with silica
are often used.
[[Maghemite]] particle (γ-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[magnetite]] particle ([[Iron(II,III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]),
as well as an intermediate iron oxide particle thereof, are most suitable
as magnetic carrier.

Generally, the quality of the magnetic beads are characterized by
following parameters:&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;&lt;ref name=tk&gt;[http://www.technochemical.com/plscnss/File/Magnetic%20Particles.pdf Magnetic Particles] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203015130/http://www.technochemical.com/plscnss/File/Magnetic%20Particles.pdf |date=December 3, 2013 }}(Written in Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[saturation magnetization]] (～10-80 A m2/kg (emu/g):[[Superparamagnetic]]),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*[[coercive force]] (～ 0.80-15.92 kA/m),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*size [[diameter]] (～ 0.1-0.5 μm),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*mass of each particle (～ 2.7&amp;nbsp;ng),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;&lt;ref group=notes&gt;
[[Order estimation]] procedures for estimating are as follows.
*Radius of each particle (r) is about
::0.5 μm &lt;math&gt;=0.5 \frac{1}{10^6}\frac{100}{1} cm =0.5\times 10^{-4} cm&lt;/math&gt;.
*So, volume of each particle (V) is about 5.2*10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by
::&lt;math&gt;V=2\times \frac{2}{3}\pi r^3=\frac{4}{3}\pi {r}^{3}&lt;/math&gt;.
*When we supposed that magnatic particle are [[Iron(II,III) oxide|Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] then, the density (D) 5.17 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
*So weight (w) of each particle is about
::w=VD=2.7 pg&lt;/ref&gt;
*ease of collection (to be mentioned later),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*capture ability (to be mentioned later),&lt;ref name=hitachi/&gt;
*[[Stokes' law|Sedimentation rate]] (～4% in 30 min),&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;
*[[Area ratio]] (&gt; 100 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g),
*[[Effective density]] (～ 2.5 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and
*[[Particle counts]] (～ 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; particles/mg).&lt;ref name=tk/&gt;

Here, "ease of collection" is defined and compared by&lt;blockquote&gt;
"magnetic beads are collected by not less than X wt % (～90wt %) within T seconds(～ 3 seconds) in the presence of a magnetic field of Y gauss (～3000 [[Gauss (unit)|gauss]]) when it is dispersed in an amount of at least Z mg (～20 mg) in W mL (～1 mL) of an aqueous solution of a sample containing a biological substance" &lt;/blockquote&gt; and, capture ability are defined and compared by&lt;blockquote&gt;
"binding with at least A μg (～0.4μg) of the biological substance per B mg (～1 mg) thereof
when it is dispersed in an amount of at least Z mg (～20 mg) in W mL (～1 mL) of an aqueous solution of a sample containing a biological substance".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Basic principles==
The principle of this method&lt;ref name="Boom1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boom2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; is based on the nucleic acid-binding properties of silica particles or diatoms in the presence of this chaotropic agent, which are according to the [[Chaotropic agent|chaotropic effect]].

Put simply, the chaotropic effect is where a chaotropic anion in an aqueous solution disturbs the structure of water, and weakens the hydrophobic interaction.&lt;ref name=genecle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/courses/Molbio/MolStudents/spring99/lauren/geneclean.html|title=GENECLEAN assignment|first=Lauren|last=Freeman|website=www.bio.davidson.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=napr&gt;maxXbond: first regeneration system for DNA binding silica matrices
KH Esser, WH Marx, T Lisowsky&amp;nbsp;– Nature Methods| Application Notes, 2006
[http://www.nature.com/app_notes/nmeth/2006/060117/full/nmeth845.html][http://www.nature.com/app_notes/nmeth/2006/060117/fig_tab/nmeth845_F1.html] see also,[http://it.vwr-cmd.com/ex/downloads/life_science/biomarke/0709/bioMarkeMagazine-18_20.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a broad sense, "chaotropic agent" stands for any substance
capable of altering the secondary, tertiary and/or quaternary
structure of proteins and nucleic acids, but leaving at least the
primary structure intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/chaotropic|title=Medical Definition of CHAOTROPIC|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aqueous solution of chaotropic salt is a chaotropic agent. Chaotropic anion increase the [[entropy]] of the system by interfering with inter molecular interactions mediated by non-covalent forces such as hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and hydrophobic effects.
Examples thereof are aqueous solution of:
[[thiocyanate ion]], [[iodine ion]], [[perchlorate ion]],
[[nitrate ion]], [[bromine ion]],
[[chlorine ion]], [[acetate ion]], [[fluorine ion]], and
[[sulfate ion]], or mutual combinations therewith.
According to the original method of Boom method, the chaotropic
guanidinium salt employed IS preferably guanidinium
thiocyanate (GuSCN).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the chaotropic effect,
in the presence of the chaotropic agent, hydration water of NA are taken from the [[phosphodiester bond]] of the [[phosphate group]] of the skeleton of a NA. Thereby, the phosphate group becomes "exposed" and hydrophobic interaction between silica and exposed phosphate group are formed.

==Automated instruments==

===Tajima pipette===
Nucleic acid extraction apparatus based on the Tajima pipette&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt;&lt;ref name=tajima2/&gt; (see Fig. 2) are one of the most widespread instruments to perform the Boom method.&lt;ref name=pss&gt;
See the web site of {{Interlanguage link multi|Precision System Sciences|2=ja|3=プレシジョン・システム・サイエンス|preserve=1}}
(PSS) Inc.[http://www.pss.co.jp/](Written in Japanese). Web site of their U.S branch are [http://www.pssbio.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tajima pipette was invented by Hideji Tajima,&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; founder and president of
Precision System Sciences (PSS)&lt;ref name=pss/&gt; Inc., a Japanese manufacturer of precision and measuring instruments.
Tajima pipette is a Core Technology of PSS Inc.&lt;ref name=pss/&gt;
PSS Inc. provides [[OEM]] product based on this technology (for example MagNA Pure(R) )
for several leading reagent manufacturers such as [[Hoffmann-La Roche]], [[Life Technologies (Thermo Fisher Scientific)|Life Technologies]], ... and so on.
After Tajima et al.&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt; was filed, similar applications such as&lt;ref name=RDTP/&gt; have also been filed by other parties.

The Tajima pipette performs magnetic particle control method and procedure, which can separate magnetic particles combined with a target substance from the liquid by magnetic force and suspend them in a liquid.

====Configurations====
The pipette itself is an apparatus comprising following members (see Fig. 2).&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt;
: '''pipette tip''' configured to be able to access and aspirate/discharge liquid from/into each of vessels, having
::a front end portion,
::a reservoir portion,
::a liquid passage
:::connecting the front end portion and the reservoir portion,
::a separation region
:::in the liquid passage subjected to an action of a magnetic field, and
::a mechanism
:::for applying a negative or positive pressure to the interior of the pipette portion to draw or discharge a magnetic substance suspended liquid into or from the pipette portion
:'''magnetic field Source'''
::arranged on the outside of and adjacent to pipette tip; and
:'''magnetic field source driving device'''
::for driving the magnetic field source to apply or remove a magnetic field to or from the separation region from outside the liquid passage. When the magnet is brought close to the pipette tip, a magnetic field is applied; when retracted away from the pipette tip, that magnetic field is removed.

A nucleic acid extraction apparatus incorporating Tajima pipettes typically consists of:&lt;ref name="Tajima"/&gt;
:Above mentioned '''Tajima pipette''',
:Plurality of '''tubes'''.
: Plurality of '''tube holder''' for above mentioned tubes,
:'''Transport mean'''
::to transport Tajima pipette among that plurality of tubes (tubes are supported by tube holder), and
:'''Control device'''
::for controlling abovementioned devices.

====Motions====
'''(a) Capturing of the magnetic beads.'''&lt;br&gt;
During this suction process,
when the magnetic field are applied to the separation region of piper tip, from outside of pipette tip, by the magnet arranged on the outside of the pipette tip,
as liquid containing magnetic beads passes through a separation region of the pipette tip,
the magnetic particles are attracted to and arrested to the inner wall of tile separation region of pipette tip.

Subsequently, when that solution are discharged under the conditions of has been kept the magnetic field,
magnetic particles only are left in the inside of pipette tip.
In this way magnetic particles are separated from liquid.

In accordance with Tajima,&lt;ref name=Tajima/&gt;
the preferable suction height of the mixture liquid is such that
:the bottom level of the liquid is higher than the lower end of the separation region of the liquid passage  (That means bottom level of the liquid is higher than the lower end of the magnet.),
::when all the mixture liquid is drawn up,
::so as to ensure that the aspirated magnetic particles can be completely arrested.

At this time, because the magnetic particles are wet, they stay attached to the inner surface of the
separation region of the liquid passage of the pipette tip. If the pipette tip P is moved or
transported, the magnetic particles will not come off easily.

'''(b) Re-suspension of the captured magnetic beads.'''&lt;br&gt;

After the magnetic particles are arrested by above mentioned manner (a),
::so the mixture liquid removed of the magnetic particles is discharged into the liquid accommodating portion (Vessel) and drained out, with only the magnetic particles remaining in the pipette tip,
we can do the re-suspension process.

Re-suspension of the captured magnetic beads are in detail, consists of the following steps.
Of cause, we consider that, the state in which that magnetic material has been captured
by above mention way.
*Aspirate liquid such as washing buffer into the tip
*Quit the application of a magnetic field
::By "Quit the application of a magnetic field" the magnetic particles are suspended in the liquid.
*Discharging the liquid (such as washing buffer) from pipette tip to vessel (in the condition of magnetic force generated by the magnet body is cut off.).

====Operations====
An example of the operations of the nucleic acid extraction apparatus which incorporates
Tajima pipette are typically as shown in Fig. 1.

===Other methods===
Examples of other type of method of the magnetic particle capturing device are as follows.
*Pen type capture&lt;ref name="PP1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PP2"/&gt;
*tube type capture&lt;ref name=quod/&gt;&lt;ref name=leviathan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7741129|title=Method for treating magnetic particles and biological analysis device using magnets|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US7384559&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US7384559|title=Device and method for treating magnetic particles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=US6764859&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US6764859|title=Device and method for mixing magnetic particles with a fluid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''budget''' is a financial plan for a defined period, often one year. It may also include planned sales volumes and revenues, resource quantities, costs and expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows. Companies, governments, families and other organizations use it to express strategic plans of activities or events in measurable terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CIMA Official Terminology |url=http://www1.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/cig_tg_budgeting_mar08.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810055251/http://www.cimaglobal.com/Documents/ImportedDocuments/cig_tg_budgeting_mar08.pdf |archivedate=2013-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A budget is the sum of money allocated for a particular purpose and the summary of intended expenditures along with proposals for how to meet them. It may include a budget surplus, providing money for use at a future time, or a deficit in which expenses exceed income.
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - Comme Sisyphe - Honoré Daumier.jpg|thumb|''Comme Sisyphe'' - Honoré Daumier (Brooklyn Museum)]] 

==Etymology==
A budget (derived from the old [[French language|French]] word meaning purse) is a quantified financial plan for a forthcoming accounting period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A budget is an important concept in [[microeconomics]], which uses a [[budget line]] to illustrate the trade-offs between two or more [[good (economics)|goods]]. In other terms, a budget is an organizational plan stated in monetary terms.

In summary, the purpose of budgeting tools:
# Tools provide a forecast of revenues and expenditures, that is, construct a model of how a business might perform financially if certain strategies, events and plans are carried out.
# Tools enable the actual financial operation of the business to be measured against the forecast.
# Lastly, tools establish the cost constraint for a [[project]], program, or [[Business operations|operation]].

==Corporate==
The budget of a [[company (law)|company]] is often compiled annually, but may not be a finished budget, usually requiring considerable effort, is a plan for the short-term future, typically allows hundreds or even thousands of people in various departments (operations, human resources, IT, etc.) to list their expected revenues and expenses in the final budget.

If the actual figures delivered through the budget period come close to the budget, this suggests that the managers understand their business and have been successfully driving it in the intended direction. On the other hand, if the figures diverge wildly from the budget, this sends an 'out of control' signal, and the share price could suffer. Campaign planners incur two types of cost in any campaign: the first is the cost of human resource necessary to plan and execute the campaign. The second type of expense that campaign planners incur is the hard cost of the campaign itself.

==Event management==
A budget is a fundamental tool for an [[event management|event director]] to predict with a reasonable accuracy whether the event will result in a profit, a loss or will break-even. A budget can also be used as a [[Pricing science|pricing tool]].

There are two basic approaches or philosophies, when it comes to budgeting. One approach is telling you on mathematical models, and the other on people.

The first school of thought believes that financial models, if properly constructed, can be used to predict the future. The focus is on variables, inputs and outputs, drivers and the like. Investments of time and money are devoted to perfecting these models, which are typically held in some type of financial spreadsheet application.

The other school of thought holds that it's not about models, it's about people. No matter how sophisticated models can get, the best information comes from the people in the business. The focus is therefore in engaging the managers in the business more fully in the [[budget process]], and building accountability for the results. The companies that adhere to this approach have their managers develop their own budgets. While many companies would say that they do both, in reality the investment of time and money falls squarely in one approach or the other.

==Government==
{{details|Government budget}}
The budget of a [[government]] is a summary or plan of the intended revenues and expenditures of that government. There are three types of government budget : the operating or current budget, the capital or investment budget, and the cash or cash flow budget.&lt;ref&gt;Cliche, P. (2012). “Budget,” in L. Côté and J.-F. Savard (eds.), Encyclopedic Dictionary of Public Administration, [online], http://www.dictionnaire.enap.ca/Dictionnaire/en/home.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

The budget is prepared by the [[Her Majesty's Treasury|Treasury]] team led by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and is presented to Parliament by the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] on Budget Day. It is customary for the Chancellor to stand on the steps of Number 11 Downing Street with his or her team for the media to get photographic shots of the [[Red box (government)|Despatch Box]], immediately prior to them going to the [[House of Commons]].  Once presented in the House of Commons it is debated and then voted on.  Minor changes may be made however with the budget being written and presented by the party with the majority in the House of Commons (the Government), the [[Whip (politics)|Whips]] will ensure that it is passed as written by the Chancellor. {{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

===United States===
{{main|United States federal budget}}
The federal budget is prepared by the [[Office of Management and Budget]], and submitted to Congress for consideration. Invariably, Congress makes many and substantial changes. Nearly all American states are required to have [[balanced budget]]s, but the federal government is allowed to run deficits. {{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

===[[India]]===
{{main|Union budget of India}}
The budget is prepared by the Budget Division  Department of Economic Affairs of the [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]] annually. The Finance Minister is the head of the budget making committee. The present Indian Finance minister is [[Arun Jaitley]]. The Budget includes supplementary excess grants and when a proclamation by the [[President of India|President]] as to failure of Constitutional machinery is in operation in relation to a State or a Union Territory, preparation of the Budget of such State.{{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

The first budget of India was submitted on 18 February 1869 by James Wilson. James Wilson is known as the father of Indian budget.

===Philippines===
The Philippine budget is considered the most complicated in the world, incorporating multiple approaches in one single budget system: line-item (budget execution), performance (budget accountability), and [[zero-based budgeting]]. The [[Department of Budget and Management]] (DBM) prepares the National Expenditure Program and forwards it to the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives to come up with a General Appropriations Bill (GAB). The GAB will go through budget deliberations and voting; the same process occurs when the GAB is transmitted to the [[Philippine Senate]].

After both houses of Congress approves the GAB, the President signs the bill into a General Appropriations Act (GAA); also, the President may opt to veto the GAB and have it returned to the legislative branch or leave the bill unsigned for 30 days and lapse into law. There are two types of budget bill veto: the [[line-item veto]] and the veto of the whole budget. {{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

==Personal or family==
{{details|Personal budget}}
A personal budget or home budget is a [[finance plan]] that allocates future personal [[income]] towards [[expense]]s, [[savings]] and [[debt]] repayment. Past spending and [[consumer debt|personal debt]] are considered when creating a personal budget. There are several methods and tools available for creating, using and adjusting a personal budget. For example, jobs are an income source, while bills and rent payments are expenses.    A third category (other than income and expenses) may be assets (such as property, investments or other savings or value) representing a potential reserve for funds in case of budget shortfalls.

There are many informational sites and software available for use in personal and family problems.

==Types==
* '''Sales budget''' – an estimate of future sales, often broken down into both units. It is used to create company and sales goals.
* '''[[Production budget]]''' - an estimate of the number of units that must be manufactured to meet the sales goals. The production budget also estimates the various costs involved with manufacturing those units, including labor and material. Created by product oriented companies.
* '''[[Capital budget]]''' - used to determine whether an organization's long-term investments such as new machinery, replacement machinery, new plants, new products, and research development projects are worth pursuing.
* '''Cash flow/cash budget''' – a prediction of future cash receipts and expenditures for a particular time period. It usually covers a period in the short-term future. The cash flow budget helps the business to determine when income will be sufficient to cover expenses and when the company will need to seek outside financing.
* '''[[Conditional budgeting]]''' is a [[budget]]ing approach designed for companies with fluctuating income, high [[fixed cost]]s, or income depending on [[sunk costs]], as well as [[Non-profit organization|NPOs]] and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]]. 
* '''Marketing budget''' – an estimate of the funds needed for promotion, advertising, and public relations in order to market the product or service.
* '''Project budget''' – a prediction of the costs associated with a particular company project. These costs include labour, materials, and other related expenses. The project budget is often broken down into specific tasks, with task budgets assigned to each. A cost estimate is used to establish a project budget.
* '''Revenue budget''' – consists of revenue receipts of government and the expenditure met from these revenues. Tax revenues are made up of taxes and other duties that the government levies.
* '''Expenditure budget''' – includes spending data items..
* '''Flexibility budget''' - it is established for fixed cost and variable rate is determined per activity measure for variable cost.
* '''Appropriation budget''' - a maximum amount is established for certain expenditure based on management judgment.
*'''Performance budget''' - it is mostly used by organization and ministries involved in the development activities. This process of budget takes into account the end results.
* '''Zero based budget''' - A budget type where every item added to the budget needs approval and no items are carried forward from the prior years budget. This type of budget has a clear advantage when the limited resources are to be allocated carefully and objectively. Zero based budgeting takes more time to create as all pieces of the budget need to be reviewed by management.
*'''Personal budget''' - A budget type focusing on expenses for self or for home, usually involves an income to budget.

The name "COPII" refers to the specific '''co'''at '''p'''rotein complex that initiates the budding process.  The coat consists of large protein subcomplexes that are made of four different protein subunits.

==Coat proteins==
There are two protein [[heterodimer]]s that form the coat complex.  These proteins are
*[[SEC23A|Sec23p]]/[[SEC24A|Sec24p]] Heterodimer
*[[SEC13|Sec13p]]/[[SEC31|Sec31p]] Heterotetramer
These proteins alone are not able to cause the budding of the vesicle or direct the vesicle to the correct target membrane.  SNARE, cargo, and other proteins are also needed for these processes to occur.  The CopII protein does, however, cause the binding that forms vesicle coat, and thereby causes the release from the ER.  The exact process of how the vesicle is brought to a particular location, or how that location is determined is not yet known.

==Budding process==
The [[GTPase]] [[Sar1]]p is a protein that hydrolyzes [[Guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and acts like a molecular "switch" that flips between an activated and membrane embedded GTP-bound form, and inactive and soluble GDP-bound form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonifacino|first=Juan S.|last2=Glick|first2=Benjamin S.|date=2004-01-23|title=The mechanisms of vesicle budding and fusion|journal=Cell|volume=116|issue=2|pages=153–166|issn=0092-8674|pmid=14744428|doi=10.1016/s0092-8674(03)01079-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inactive GDP-bound Sar1p is attracted to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum. Sec12, a transmembrane protein found in the ER acts as a Guanine nucleotide exchange factor by stimulating the release of GDP to allow the binding of GTP. Now in a GTP bound state, Sar1p undergoes a conformational change which exposes a hydrophobic tail that can be inserted into the lipid bilayer, binding it to the membrane.  Membrane-bound Sar1p recruits the Sec23p/24p complex to form what is collectively known as the pre-budding complex. The pre-budding complex recruits the long, flexible Sec13p/31p complex.  Sec13p/31p complexes polymerizes on the cytosolic side of the membrane to form a convex mesh structure.  The assembling mesh causes the membrane to bulge outward until a vesicle buds off. Some proteins are found to be responsible for selectively packaging cargos into COPII vesicles. For example, Erv29p in ''Saccharomyces cerevisiae'' is found to be necessary for packaging glycosylated pro-α-factor.&lt;ref&gt;Belden WJ and Barlowe C. [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/294/5546/1528.full Role of Erv29p in Collecting Soluble Secretory Proteins into ER-Derived Transport Vesicles]. ''Science''. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conformational changes==
CopII has three specific binding sites that can each be complexed.  The adjacent picture (Sed5) uses the Sec22 t-SNARE complex to bind.  This site is more strongly bound, and therefore is more favored. (Embo)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10210">The '''Cenozoic Research Laboratory''' ({{zh|c=新生代地质与环境研究室}}) of the [[Geological Survey of China]] was established within the [[Peking Union Medical College]] in [[1928 in archaeology|1928]] by [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[paleoanthropologist]] [[Davidson Black]] and [[China|Chinese]] [[geologist]]s [[Ding Wenjing]] and [[Weng Wenhao]] for the research and appraisal of [[Peking Man]] fossils unearthed at [[Zhoukoudian]].

==History==
Davidson Black founded the laboratory with an $80,000 grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and  stayed on as honorary director until he died in his office, surrounded by his finds, in [[1934 in archaeology|1934]].&lt;ref name="sheilaMelvin1"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php | title = Archaeology: Peking Man, still missing and missed | accessdate = April 20, 2008 | author = | last = Melvin | first = Sheila | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = October 11, 2005 | year = | month = | format = | work = | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | pages = | doi = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20051012071152/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php| archivedate =2005-10-12| dead-url = yes | quote = Black died at his office desk in the middle of the night with a skullcap of Peking Man beside him.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Germany|German]] [[Jewish]] [[anthropologist]] [[Franz Weidenreich]].

Excavations at Zhoukoudian ceased in [[1937 in archaeology|1937]] with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese occupation]] and the fossils from the site were locked in the laboratory safe under the assumption that they would be secure at the American-run hospital.&lt;ref name="sheilaMelvin2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php | title = Archaeology: Peking Man, still missing and missed | accessdate = April 20, 2008 | author = | last = Melvin | first = Sheila | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = October 11, 2005 | year = | month = | format = | work = | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | pages = | doi = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20051012071152/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php| archivedate =2005-10-12| dead-url = yes | quote = Although there was some discussion of moving the bones after the Japanese invasion in 1937, they were apparently assumed to be safe because they were housed in the American-run Peking Union Medical Hospital, which oversaw the Cenozoic Research Lab.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the summer of [[1941 in archaeology|1941]], fearing imminent war between America and Japan, Weidenreich ordered copies of the bones to be made. When this task had been completed secretary [[Hu Chengzi]] packed up the fossils so they could be shipped to the U.S. for safekeeping until the end of the war. They were never seen again.&lt;ref name="sheilaMelvin3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php | title = Archaeology: Peking Man, still missing and missed | accessdate = April 20, 2008 | author = | last = Melvin | first = Sheila | authorlink = | coauthors = | date = October 11, 2005 | year = | month = | format = | work = | publisher = [[International Herald Tribune]] | pages = | doi = | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20051012071152/http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/10/features/melvin.php| archivedate =2005-10-12| dead-url = yes | quote = Franz Weidenreich, a German who led the Cenozoic Lab after Black's death, insisted that copies of all the Peking Man bones be made in the summer of 1941 because he feared (correctly) that Japanese would take over the lab if war broke out with the United States. But it was not until the late autumn of 1941 that the bones were crated and sent to the American controller of Peking Union Medical College for shipment to the United States - and vanished forever.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now only Weidenreich’s timely copies and the research notes of the staff remain to demonstrate the pioneering work of this laboratory that is considered to be the precursor of the modern [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]] (IVPP) of the [[Chinese Academy of Science]].

The group grew out of the [[Academic conference|Conference]] on the Teaching of Modern [[Physics]] held at [[Fermilab]] in 1986, organized by the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Aubrecht, ed., ''Quarks, Quasars, and Quandaries: Proceedings of the Conference on the Teaching of Modern Physics'' (College Park, MD: American Association of Physics Teachers, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; The group's first effort aimed to supply a chart for [[particle physics]] teaching that would rival the [[Periodic Table]] of the [[Chemical element|elements]]. The first version of this chart was published in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamental Particles and Interactions — A Wall Chart of Modern Physics'', Fundamental Particle and Interaction Chart Committee (W. Achor et al.), Phys. Teach. 26, 556 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

CPEP has created four charts emphasizing contemporary aspects of physics research: [[Elementary particle|particles]] and interactions; [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] and [[plasma physics]]; [[nuclear science]]; and [[cosmology]]. Almost half a million of these charts and similar products have been distributed.

The group has created website support for teaching for each of the charts.&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

CPEP received the 2017 "Excellence in Physics Education Award" from the American Physical Society, "for leadership in providing educational materials on contemporary physics topics to students for over 25 years."&lt;ref name="website"/&gt;

Offshoots of CPEP include the book, "The Charm of Strange Quarks: Mysteries and Revolutions of Particle Physics" (2000), by R. Michael Barnett, Henry Muehry, and [[Helen R. Quinn]], three of the founders of CPEP. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barnett |first1=R.

The '''length of the day''', which has increased over the long term of [[Earth's history]] due to [[tidal acceleration|tidal effects]], is also subject to fluctuations on a shorter scale of time. Exact measurements of time by [[atomic clock]]s and satellite [[laser ranging]] have revealed that the length of day (LOD) is subject to a number of different changes. These subtle variations have periods that range from a few weeks to a few years. They are attributed to interactions between the dynamic [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]] and Earth itself. The [[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] monitors the changes.

==Introduction==
In the absence of external torques, the total [[angular momentum]] of Earth as a whole system must be constant. Internal torques are due to relative movements and mass redistribution of Earth's core, mantle, crust, oceans, atmosphere, and [[cryosphere]]. In order to keep the total [[angular momentum]] constant, a change of the angular momentum  in one region  must necessarily be balanced by angular momentum changes in the other regions.

Crustal movements (such as [[continental drift]]) or polar cap melting are slow secular events. The characteristic coupling time between core and mantle has been estimated to be on the order of ten years, and the so-called 'decade fluctuations' of [[Earth's rotation]] rate are thought to result from fluctuations within the core, transferred to the mantle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hide|first=R.|title=Fluctuations in the Earth's Rotation and the Topography of the Core–Mantle Interface|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|volume=328|issue=1599|pages=351–363|doi=10.1098/rsta.1989.0040|date=1989|bibcode = 1989RSPTA.328..351H }}&lt;/ref&gt; The length of day (LOD) varies significantly even for time scales from a few years down to weeks (Figure), and the observed fluctuations in the LOD - after eliminating the effects of external torques - are  a direct consequence of the action of internal torques. These short term fluctuations are very probably generated by the interaction between the solid Earth and the atmosphere.

==Observations==
[[Image:Deviation of day length from SI day.svg|thumb|Deviation of day length from SI based day]]
Any change of the axial component of the atmospheric [[angular momentum]] (AAM) must be accompanied by a corresponding change of the angular momentum of Earth's crust and mantle (due to the law of conservation of angular momentum). Because the [[moment of inertia]] of the system mantle-crust is only slightly influenced by atmospheric pressure loading, this mainly requires a change in the [[angular velocity]] of the solid Earth; ''i.e.'', a change of LOD. The LOD can presently be measured to a high accuracy over integration times of only a few hours,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=Douglas|title=Geophysical applications of very-long-baseline interferometry|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=1991|volume=63|issue=4|pages=899–918|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.63.899|bibcode = 1991RvMP...63..899R }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[general circulation model]]s of the atmosphere allow high precision determination of changes in AAM in the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eubanks|first=T.

O.|title=Earth's Variable Rotation|journal=Science|date=1991|volume=253|issue=5020|pages=629–637|doi=10.1126/science.253.5020.629|pmid=17772366|bibcode = 1991Sci...253..629H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exchange of angular momentum==

One means of exchange of angular momentum between the atmosphere and the non gaseous parts of the earth is evaporation and precipitation. Massive quantities of water are in continual flux between the oceans and the atmosphere. As the mass of water (vapour) rises its rotation must slow due to conservation of angular momentum. Equally when if falls as rain, its rate of rotation will increase to conserve angular momentum. Any net global transfer of water mass from oceans to the atmosphere or the opposite implies a change in the speed of rotation of the solid/liquid Earth which will be reflected in LOD. {{citation needed | date = March 2016}}

Observational evidence shows that there is no significant time delay between the change of AAM and its corresponding change of LOD for periods longer than about 10&amp;nbsp;days. This implies a strong coupling between atmosphere and solid Earth due to surface [[friction]] with a time constant of  about 7&amp;nbsp;days, the spin-down time of the [[Ekman layer]]. This spin-down time is the characteristic time for the transfer of atmospheric axial angular momentum to Earth's surface and vice versa.

The zonal wind-component on the ground, which is most effective for the transfer of axial angular momentum between Earth and atmosphere, is the component describing rigid rotation of the  atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Volland&gt;{{cite journal|last=Volland|first=H.|title=Atmosphere and Earth's rotation|journal=Surveys in Geophysics|date=1996|volume=17|issue=1|pages=101–144|doi=10.1007/BF01904476|bibcode = 1996SGeo...17..101V }}&lt;/ref&gt; The zonal wind of this component has the  amplitude ''u'' at the equator relative to the ground, where  ''u''&amp;nbsp;&gt; 0 indicates superrotation and ''u''&amp;nbsp;&lt; 0 indicates retrograde rotation with respect to the solid Earth. All other wind terms merely redistribute the AAM with latitude, an effect that cancels out when averaged over the globe.

Surface friction allows the atmosphere to 'pick up' angular momentum from Earth in the case of retrograde rotation or release it to Earth in the case of superrotation. Averaging over longer time scales, no exchange  of AAM with the solid Earth takes place. Earth and atmosphere are decoupled. This implies that the  ground level zonal wind-component responsible for rigid rotation must be zero on the average. Indeed, the observed meridional structure of the climatic mean zonal wind on the ground shows westerly winds (from the west) in middle latitudes beyond about ± 30&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; latitude and easterly winds (from the east) in low latitudes—the [[trade wind]]s—as well as near the poles
([[prevailing winds]]).&lt;ref name="Murgatroyd"&gt;Murgatroyd, R.J., .
The structure and dynamics of the stratosphere, in Coby G.A. (ed): ''The Global Circulation of the  Atmosphere'',  Roy. Met. Soc., London, p. 159, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;
The atmosphere picks up angular momentum from Earth at low and high latitudes and transfers the same amount to Earth at middle latitudes.

Any short term fluctuation of the rigidly rotating zonal wind-component is then accompanied by a corresponding  change in LOD. In order to estimate the order of magnitude of that effect, one may consider the total atmosphere to rotate  rigidly with velocity ''u'' (in m/s) without surface friction. Then this value is related to the corresponding change of the length of day {{math|Δ''&amp;tau;''}} (in milliseconds) as{{citation needed | date = November 2017}}
 
:&lt;math&gt;u \approx 2.7 \Delta\tau.&lt;/math&gt;

The annual component of the change of the length of day of {{math|Δ''&amp;tau;'' ≈ 0.34}}&amp;nbsp;ms corresponds then to a superrotation of {{math|''u'' ≈ 0.9}}&amp;nbsp;m/s, and the semiannual component of {{math|Δ''&amp;tau;'' ≈ 0.29}}&amp;nbsp;ms to {{math|''u'' ≈ 0.8}}&amp;nbsp;m/s.

In [[applied mathematics]], '''discretization''' is the process of transferring [[continuous function|continuous]] functions, models, variables, and equations into [[wiktionary:discrete|discrete]] counterparts.  This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers. '''Dichotomization''' is the special case of discretization in which the number of discrete classes is 2, which can approximate a continuous variable as a [[binary variable]] (creating a [[dichotomy]] for [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes, as in [[binary classification]]). 

Discretization is also related to [[discrete mathematics]], and is an important component of [[granular computing]].  In this context, ''discretization'' may also refer to modification of variable or category ''granularity'', as when multiple discrete variables are aggregated or multiple discrete categories fused.

Whenever continuous data is '''discretized''', there is always some amount of [[discretization error]]. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered [[wikt:negligible|negligible]] for the [[conceptual model|modeling]] purposes at hand.

{{Anchor|Discretization-quantization}} The terms ''discretization '' and ''[[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]''&lt;!-- Do not tag bomb this link with {{dn}}; its target is at the intentional and appropriate level of polysemy. --&gt; often have the same [[denotation]] but not always identical [[connotations]].&lt;!-- If you need deeper exploration of this truth, you will need to go read about [[cognitive synonymy]] and the lack of it in natural language. --&gt; (Specifically, the two terms share a [[semantic field]].) The same is true of [[discretization error]] and [[quantization error]].

Mathematical methods relating to discretization include the [[Euler–Maruyama method]] and the [[zero-order hold]].

== Discretization of linear state space models {{anchor|discrete function}} ==
Discretization is also concerned with the transformation of continuous [[differential equation]]s into discrete [[difference equations]], suitable for [[Numerical analysis|numerical computing]].

The following continuous-time [[State space (controls)|state space model]]

:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf A \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf B \mathbf{u}(t) + \mathbf{w}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf C \mathbf{x}(t) + \mathbf D \mathbf{u}(t) + \mathbf{v}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''v'' and ''w'' are continuous zero-mean [[white noise]] sources with [[power spectral density | power spectral densities]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}(t) \sim N(0,\mathbf Q)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}(t) \sim N(0,\mathbf R)&lt;/math&gt;

can be discretized, assuming [[zero-order hold]] for the input ''u'' and continuous integration for the noise ''v'', to

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}[k+1] = \mathbf A_d \mathbf{x}[k] + \mathbf B_d \mathbf{u}[k] + \mathbf{w}[k]&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}[k] = \mathbf C_d \mathbf{x}[k] + \mathbf D_d \mathbf{u}[k] +  \mathbf{v}[k]&lt;/math&gt;

with covariances

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}[k] \sim N(0,\mathbf Q_d)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}[k] \sim N(0,\mathbf R_d)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_d = e^{\mathbf A T} = \mathcal{L}^{-1}\{(s\mathbf I - \mathbf A)^{-1}\}_{t=T} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B_d = \left( \int_{\tau=0}^{T}e^{\mathbf A \tau}d\tau \right) \mathbf B = \mathbf A^{-1}(\mathbf A_d - I)\mathbf B &lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; is [[Invertible matrix|nonsingular]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf C_d = \mathbf C &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf D_d = \mathbf D &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf Q_d = \int_{\tau=0}^{T} e^{\mathbf A \tau} \mathbf Q e^{\mathbf A^\top \tau}  d\tau &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf R_d = \mathbf R T &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is the sample time, although &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A^\top&lt;/math&gt; is the transposed matrix of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;.

A clever trick to compute ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''B''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; in one step is by utilizing the following property:&lt;ref&gt;Raymond DeCarlo: ''Linear Systems: A State Variable Approach with Numerical Implementation'', Prentice Hall, NJ, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p. 215}}
:&lt;math&gt;e^{\begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{A} &amp; \mathbf{B} \\
                 \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{0} \end{bmatrix} T} = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf{M_{11}} &amp; \mathbf{M_{12}} \\
                                                            \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{I} \end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

and then having
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf A_d = \mathbf M_{11}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf B_d = \mathbf M_{12}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Discretization of process noise ===
Numerical evaluation of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_d&lt;/math&gt; is a bit trickier due to the matrix exponential integral. It can, however, be computed by first constructing a matrix, and computing the exponential of it &lt;ref&gt;Charles Van Loan: ''Computing integrals involving the matrix exponential'', IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control. 23 (3): 395–404, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = 
\begin{bmatrix} -\mathbf{A} &amp; \mathbf{Q} \\
                 \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{A}^\top \end{bmatrix} T&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{G} = e^\mathbf{F} =
\begin{bmatrix} \dots &amp; \mathbf{A}_d^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_d \\
           \mathbf{0} &amp; \mathbf{A}_d^\top             \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
The discretized process noise is then evaluated by multiplying the transpose of the lower-right partition of '''G''' with the upper-right partition of '''G''':
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}_d = (\mathbf{A}_d^\top)^\top (\mathbf{A}_d^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_d) = \mathbf{A}_d (\mathbf{A}_d^{-1}\mathbf{Q}_d). &lt;/math&gt;

=== Derivation ===
Starting with the continuous model
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\dot{x}}(t) = \mathbf A\mathbf x(t) + \mathbf B \mathbf u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
we know that the [[matrix exponential]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}e^{\mathbf At} = \mathbf A e^{\mathbf At} = e^{\mathbf At} \mathbf A&lt;/math&gt;
and by premultiplying the model we get
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf{\dot{x}}(t) = e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf A\mathbf x(t) + e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf B\mathbf u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
which we recognize as
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}(e^{-\mathbf At}\mathbf x(t)) = e^{-\mathbf At} \mathbf B\mathbf u(t)&lt;/math&gt;
and by integrating..
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-\mathbf At}\mathbf x(t) - e^0\mathbf x(0) = \int_0^t e^{-\mathbf A\tau}\mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d\tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x(t) = e^{\mathbf At}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^t e^{\mathbf A(t-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
which is an analytical solution to the continuous model.

Now we want to discretise the above expression. We assume that u is [[mathematical constant|constant]] during each timestep.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k] \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \mathbf x(kT)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k] = e^{\mathbf AkT}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^{kT} e^{\mathbf A(kT-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k+1] = e^{\mathbf A(k+1)T}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^{(k+1)T} e^{\mathbf A((k+1)T-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k+1] = e^{\mathbf AT} \left[  e^{\mathbf AkT}\mathbf x(0) + \int_0^{kT} e^{\mathbf A(kT-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau \right]+ \int_{kT}^{(k+1)T} e^{\mathbf A(kT+T-\tau)} \mathbf B\mathbf u(\tau) d \tau&lt;/math&gt;
We recognize the bracketed expression as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k]&lt;/math&gt;, and the second term can be simplified by substituting with the function &lt;math&gt;v(\tau) = kT + T - \tau&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;d\tau=-dv&lt;/math&gt;. We also assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathbf u&lt;/math&gt; is constant during the [[integral]], which in turn yields
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix} \mathbf x[k+1]&amp;=&amp; e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] - \left( \int_{v(kT)}^{v((k+1)T)} e^{\mathbf Av} dv \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \\
&amp;=&amp; e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] - \left( \int_T^0 e^{\mathbf Av} dv \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \\
&amp;=&amp; e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] + \left( \int_0^T e^{\mathbf Av} dv \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \\
&amp;=&amp;e^{\mathbf AT}\mathbf x[k] + \mathbf A^{-1}\left(e^{\mathbf AT}-\mathbf I \right) \mathbf B\mathbf u[k] \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
which is an exact solution to the discretization problem.

=== Approximations ===
Exact discretization may sometimes be intractable due to the heavy matrix exponential and integral operations involved. It is much easier to calculate an approximate discrete model, based on that for small timesteps &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf AT} \approx \mathbf I + \mathbf A T&lt;/math&gt;. The approximate solution then becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf x[k+1] \approx (\mathbf I + \mathbf AT) \mathbf x[k] + T\mathbf B \mathbf u[k] &lt;/math&gt;

Other possible approximations are &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf AT} \approx \left( \mathbf I - \mathbf A T \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;e^{\mathbf AT} \approx \left( \mathbf I +\frac{1}{2}  \mathbf A T \right) \left( \mathbf I - \frac{1}{2} \mathbf A T \right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Each of them have different stability properties. The last one is known as the [[bilinear transform]], or Tustin transform, and preserves the (in)stability of the continuous-time system.

[[File:Eidophusikon.jpg|thumb|250px|Eidophusikon]]
The '''''Eidophusikon''''' ({{lang-el|Ειδωφυσικον}}) was a piece of [[art]], no longer extant, thought up by the English actor [[David Garrick]] and created by 18th-century [[France|French]] painter [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]]. It opened in [[Leicester Square]] in February 1781.{{citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Described by the media of his day as "Moving Pictures, representing Phenomena of Nature", the ''Eidophusikon'' can be considered an early form of [[movie making]]. The effect was achieved by mirrors and pulleys.

A small exhibition centered on his Eidophusikon can currently be seen at [[The Huntington Library]].

A full Eidophusikon, described also as a "small, mechanical theatre", was exhibited from June to November 2014 at the exhibition "Underworlds" (Unterwelten) in [[Dortmund]], [[Germany]].

The Eidophusikon consisted of a large-scale miniature theatre that let experiment the try of creating the perfect illusion of the moving nature: sunrise scenes, sunsets, moonlight images, storms, and volcanoes from all over the world with sound and music effects. The sound and light effects of the Eidophusikon, compared with the shows seen until that time, were specially inventive by their realism.

== Creation ==
The need to build an element such as this was born from December 1811, when one of the great calamities of American history took place: one of its most important theaters, the Richmond Theater, was burned completely. The fire burned 72 spectators during the first act of a play and expanded rapidly across all locations, causing people to leap into decorations that had not yet been consumed. This made David Garrick think that people could interfere with the theater, and not only was it something that was going to be seen sitting.

== Reconstructions ==
The first reconstruction was the year 2004 by Wolkenbilder at the Altonaer Museum Exhibition (cloud images) at Jenisch Has, Hamburg. It was a full-sized theater with two scenes on the basis of Loutherbourg: from dawn to sunset over Royal Naval College in Greenwich and a Mediterranean scene with a lighthouse, moonlight, storms and wrecks.

The second Eidophusikon was created in 2005 by the Yale Center for British Art, New Connecticut and California Huntington Library by the English painter Gainsborough for his collection 'Sensation and sensibility. Gainsborough was a great admirer of Eidophusikon. This full-size version was built in conjunction with Kevin Derkin and the Yale technical department under Rick Johnson. The scene, this time, was 'Satan and the Creation of the Pandemonium Palace in Hell', by Milton of the "lost paradise."

In 2006, a third Eidophusikon was created by Robert Poulter for the Nouveau Musée National de Monaco. Another Mediterranean scene was created with a volcano, the moonlight, the storm and the shipwreck. This Eidophusikon is part and the permanent collection of the museum.

[[File:Hvalsey Church.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the [[Hvalsey Church]] in Greenland.]]
'''Medieval architecture''' in '''North America''' is an [[anachronism]]. Some structures in [[North America]] can however be classified as medieval, either by age or origin. In some rare cases these structures are seen as evidence on [[pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]]. Although much of this is [[pseudoscience]], these buildings are of interest to American scholars of [[medieval architecture]].

==Pre-Columbian buildings==
* [[L'Anse aux Meadows]], a [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlement in [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Foundations of eight structures, visible today only as mounds because they were reburied in a conservation effort. Includes modern reconstructions.
* [[Church of Hvalsey]], a Norse church in [[Greenland]].  Additional remains of Norse-era settlements.

==Transported buildings==
Medieval building that have been transported to North America in modern times.
* [[The Cloisters]] museum, [[New York City]], a branch of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] housed in a complex integrating elements from several different medieval structures
* [[St. Bernard de Clairvaux Church]], a 12th-century cloister from Spain, reassembled in Florida
* Elements of a 12th-century cloister from [[Saint-Génis-des-Fontaines Abbey]], a Romanesque portal, and a 15th-century chapel in the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]
* Part of a Romanesque cloister in the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], Ohio
* [[St. Joan of Arc Chapel|Chapel of St Martin de Sayssuel]], ([[St. Joan of Arc Chapel]]),  [[Marquette University]], [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]
* [[Agecroft Hall]], [[Richmond, Virginia]]
* Chapterhouse of the [[Santa María de Óvila|Abbey of María de Óvila]], under reconstruction at the [[Abbey of New Clairvaux]],  [[Vina, California]]
* A 1524 sidechapel from France in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]

Other later period buildings were also transported like the Cotswold Cottage, built in the early 17th century in [[Chedworth]], [[Gloucestershire]], [[England]], now in [[The Henry Ford]] museum in [[Dearborn, Michigan]]. The [[Church of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury]], London, which was designed by Sir [[Christopher Wren]] in 1677 is now in [[Fulton, Missouri]]. It includes a spiral staircase which probably dates to the 15th century.

The '''excavatability''' of an earth (rock and [[regolith]]) material is a measure of the material to be excavated (dug) with conventional excavation equipment such as a [[bulldozer]] with [[Bulldozer#Ripper|ripper]]s, [[backhoe]], [[Wheel tractor-scraper|scraper]] and other grading equipment. Materials that cannot be excavated with conventional excavation equipment are said to be non-[[rippable]]. Such material typically requires pre-[[Rock blasting|blasting]] or use of percussion hammers or chisels to facilitate excavation. The excavatability or [[rippability]] of earth materials is evaluated typically by a [[geophysicist]], [[engineering geologist]], or [[geotechnical engineer]].

== Distant and local, trans- and cis-eQTLs, respectively ==

Expression traits differ from most other classical [[complex traits]] in one important respect—the measured [[mRNA]] or [[protein]] trait is almost always the product of a single [[gene]] with a specific chromosomal location. eQTLs that map to the approximate location of their gene-of-origin are referred to as '''local eQTLs'''. In contrast, those that map far from the location of their gene of origin, often on different chromosomes, are referred to as '''distant eQTLs'''. Often, these two types of eQTLs are referred to as '''cis''' and '''trans''', respectively, but these terms are best reserved for instances when the regulatory mechanism (cis vs. trans) of the underlying sequence has been established. The first genome-wide study of gene expression was carried out in yeast and published in 2002.&lt;ref name="Brem2002"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brem RB, Yvert G, Clinton R, Kruglyak L | title = Genetic dissection of transcriptional regulation in budding yeast | journal = Science | volume = 296 | issue = 5568 | pages = 752–5 | date = April 2002 | pmid = 11923494 | doi = 10.1126/science.1069516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The initial wave of eQTL studies employed microarrays to measure genome-wide gene expression; more recent studies have employed massively parallel RNA sequencing.

Consequently, transcript abundance might be considered as a quantitative trait that can be mapped with considerable power.

By assaying gene
expression and [[genetic variation]] simultaneously on a genome-wide basis in a large number of individuals, statistical genetic methods can be used to map the genetic factors that underpin individual differences in quantitative levels of expression of many thousands of
transcripts.&lt;ref&gt;Cookson et. al Nat Rev Genet. 2009 Mar;10(3):184-94&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s (SNPs) reproducibly associated with complex disorders &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nicolae DL, Gamazon E, Zhang W, Duan S, Dolan ME, Cox NJ | title = Trait-associated SNPs are more likely to be eQTLs: annotation to enhance discovery from GWAS | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = e1000888 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20369019 | pmc = 2848547 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000888 | url = http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1000888 | editor1-last = Gibson | editor1-first = Greg }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as certain pharmacologic phenotypes &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gamazon ER, Huang RS, Cox NJ, Dolan ME | title = Chemotherapeutic drug susceptibility associated SNPs are enriched in expression quantitative trait loci | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 20 | pages = 9287–92 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20442332 | pmc = 2889115 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1001827107 | url = http://www.pnas.org/lookup/resid/1001827107?view=short&amp;uritype=cgi }}&lt;/ref&gt; are found to be significantly enriched for eQTLs, relative to frequency-matched control SNPs.

== Detecting eQTLs ==

Mapping eQTLs is done using standard [[QTL]] mapping methods that test the linkage between variation in expression and genetic polymorphisms. The only considerable difference is that eQTL studies can involve a million or more expression microtraits. Standard gene mapping software packages can be used, although it is often faster to use custom code such as QTL Reaper or the web-based eQTL mapping system [[GeneNetwork]]. GeneNetwork hosts many large eQTL mapping data sets and provide access to fast algorithms to map single loci and epistatic interactions. As is true in all QTL mapping studies, the final steps in  defining DNA variants that cause variation in traits are usually difficult and require a second round of experimentation.  This is especially the case for trans eQTLs that do not benefit from the strong prior probability that relevant variants are in the immediate vicinity of the parent gene. Statistical, graphical, and bioinformatic methods are used to evaluate positional candidate genes and entire systems of interactions.&lt;ref name="Kulp_2006"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kulp DC, Jagalur M | title = Causal inference of regulator-target pairs by gene mapping of expression phenotypes | journal = BMC Genomics | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 125 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16719927 | pmc = 1481560 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-7-125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee_2009"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lee SI, Dudley AM, Drubin D, Silver PA, Krogan NJ, Pe'er D, Koller D | title = Learning a prior on regulatory potential from eQTL data | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = e1000358 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19180192 | pmc = 2627940 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Health and Retirement Study''' (HRS)&lt;ref&gt;National Institute on Aging, [http://www.nia.nih.gov/ResearchInformation/ExtramuralPrograms/BehavioralAndSocialResearch/HRS.htm Growing Older in America: The Health and Retirement Study], Washington, DC, National Institutes of Health, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of Americans over age 50 conducted by the Survey Research Center (SCR) at the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]] and supported by the [[National Institute on Aging]] (NIA). The study interviews approximately 20,000 respondents every two years on subjects like health care, housing, assets,&lt;ref&gt;Hurd, M.D., Juster F.T. and Smith J.P. Enhancing the Quality of Data on Income: Recent Innovations from the HRS. In: Journal of Human Resources, 38 (3), Summer 2003, pp. 758-772.&lt;/ref&gt; pensions,&lt;ref&gt;Gustman, A. L., Mitchell, O. S., Samwick, A. A., and Steinmeier, T. L. Evaluating Pension Entitlements. In: Forecasting Retirement Needs and Retirement Wealth, eds. Mitchell, O., Hammond, B., and Rappaport, A. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000. pp. 309-326.&lt;/ref&gt; employment and disability. The study is managed through a cooperative agreement (NIA U01AG009740) between the NIA, which provides primary funding, and the ISR, which administers and conducts the survey. Beginning in  2012, HRS began adding [[genetic information]] from consenting participants to its database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nia.nih.gov/newsroom/2012/03/nia-adds-genetic-data-health-and-retirement-study "NIA adds genetic data to Health and Retirement Study"], Washington, DC, National Institutes of Health, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic measures captured by the data in the HRS are regarded as being of very high quality.&lt;ref&gt;French, E., Jones, J. &amp; McCauley, J. (2017). The Accuracy of Economic Measurement in the Health and Retirement Study. Forum for Health Economics and Policy, 0(0), pp. -. Available at doi:10.1515/fhep-2017-0001 &lt;/ref&gt; 


==Purpose==

The HRS is designed to inform the national retirement discussion as the population ages. The inspiration for the HRS emerged in the mid-1980s, when scientists at NIA and elsewhere recognized the need for a new national survey of America’s expanding older population. By that time, it had become clear that the mainstay of retirement research, the Retirement History Study (RHS), conducted from 1969 to 1979, was no longer adequately addressing contemporary retirement issues. For example, the RHS sample underrepresented women, Blacks, and Hispanics who, by the mid-1980s were a growing part of the labor force. The RHS also did not ask about health or physical or mental function, all of which can affect the decision and ability to retire. Moreover, research on the retirement process was fragmented, with economists, sociologists, psychologists, epidemiologists, demographers, and biomedical researchers proposing and conducting studies within their own "silos," often without regard to the relevant research activities of other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, W.L. and Herzog, A.R. Collecting data about the oldest old: Problems and procedures. In: The Oldest Old, eds., Richard M. Suzman, David P. Willis, and Kenneth G. Manton. New York: Oxford University Press. 1992. pp. 135-156&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining that a new approach was needed, an Ad Hoc Advisory Panel was convened by the [[National Institute on Aging]]. In early 1988 the panel recommended the initiation of a new, long-term study to examine the ways in which older adults’ changing health interacts with social, economic, and psychological factors and retirement decisions. Government experts and academic researchers from diverse disciplines were recruited to collaboratively create and design the study. Ultimately, relevant executive agencies and the [[United States Congress]] recognized the value of this major social science investment, and the HRS was established.
==Administrative Information==
Many individuals and institutions have contributed to the planning, design, development, and ongoing administration of the study. This includes the study’s leadership at the Institute for Social Research, specifically the first HRS Director, [[F. Thomas Juster]], who led the effort to initiate the HRS,&lt;ref&gt;Wealth, Work, and Health: Innovations in Measurement in the Social Sciences: Essays in honor of F. Thomas Juster, Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert J. Willis, the Director from 1995 to 2007, and David R. Weir, the current Director. HRS relies on the contributions of the HRS co-investigators, a multidisciplinary group of leading academic researchers at the University of Michigan and other institutions nationwide, a steering committee and working groups, which have provided critical advice about the study’s design and monitored its progress, and the NIA-HRS Data Monitoring Committee, an advisory group of independent members of the academic research community and representatives of agencies interested in the study. 

In addition, the [[Social Security Administration]] has provided technical advice and substantial support for the study. Over the HRS’s history, other important contributors have included the [[United States Department of Labor]]’s Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, and the State of [[Florida]].

==Related Studies==
The HRS has a number of sister studies in other countries. In recent years, the HRS has been extended to several Asian countries, including Korea ([[the Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging or KLoSA]]), Japan (the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement or JSTAR), China ([[Chinese Health and Retirement Survey|the Chinese Health and Retirement Survey or CHARLS]]), India (The Longitudinal Aging Study in India or LASI) and New Zealand (Health, Work and Retirement Study). Population aging is very rapid in Asia and India and China alone will have more than one billion people over age 60 during this century. CHARLS is headed by a team at the Chinese Center for Economic Research (CCER) at Peking University under the direction of Professor Zhao Yaohui. LASI is jointly headed by a team from Harvard University under the direction of Professor David Bloom and the International Institute of Population Studies (IIPS) in Mumbai India. Both CHARLS and LASI were awarded peer review grants to conduct pilot studies by the National Institute of Aging in the United States. Other studies include:
* [[English Longitudinal Study of Ageing]] (ELSA)
* Mexican Health and Aging Study (MHAS)
* [[Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe]] (SHARE)
* New Zealand Health, Work and Retirement Survey
* Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging
* [[Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE)|WHO's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health]] (SAGE)
* SHARE Israel

* Longitudinal Aging Study in India (LASI)
* [[Chinese Health and Retirement Survey|the Chinese Health and Retirement Survey]] (CHARLS)
* the Japanese Study of Aging and Retirement (JSTAR)
* the Northern Ireland Cohort for the Longitudinal Study of Ageing (NICOLA)

The Gateway to Global Aging Data, a resource that facilitates the use and harmonization of the different datasets of HRS and sister studies in other countries has been developed with support of the [[National Institute on Aging]], National Institutes of Health (RC2 AG036619-01 and R01 AG030153)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1887">The term '''high-conductance state''' describes a particular state of [[neuron]]s in specific states of the [[brain]], such as for example during [[wakefulness]], attentive states, or even during some [[anesthetize]]d states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Mihai A |last1=Petrovici|first2=Ilja |last2=Bytschok|first3=Johannes |last3=Bill|first4= Johannes |last4=Schemmel |first5=Karlheinz |last5=Meier|title=The high-conductance state enables neural sampling in networks of LIF neurons|journal=BMC Neuroscience|volume=16|date=2015|doi=10.1186/1471-2202-16-S1-O2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In individual neurons, the high-conductance state is formally defined by the fact that the total [[synapse|synaptic]] conductance received by the neuron is larger than its natural resting (or leak) conductance, so in a sense the neuron is "driven" by its inputs rather than being dominated by its intrinsic activity.  High-conductance states have been well characterized experimentally, but they also have motivated numerous theoretical studies, in particular in relation to the considerable amount of "noise" present in such states.  It is believed that this "[[synaptic noise]]" has determinant properties on neuronal processing, and even may confer several computational advantages to neurons (see details in the article [http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/High-conductance_state High-Conductance State] in [[Scholarpedia]]).

The term '''high-conductance state''' is also used to describe specific states of single [[ion channel]]s.  In this case, the high-conductance state corresponds to an open state of the channel which is associated with a particularly high conductance compared to other states.

'''Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services''' ('''INCOIS''') is an autonomous organization of the [[Government of India]], under the [[Ministry of Earth Sciences]], located in [[Pragathi Nagar]], [[Hyderabad]]. ESSO-INCOIS was established as an autonomous body in 1999 under the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) and is a unit of the Earth System Science Organization (ESSO). ESSO- INCOIS is mandated to provide the best possible ocean information and advisory services to society, industry, government agencies and the scientific community through sustained ocean observations and constant improvements through systematic and focussed research.

==History==

During 90s, the Ministry of Earth Sciences, formerly Department of Ocean Development (DOD), had initiated a project titled "PFZ Mission" and it was handed over to [[National Remote Sensing Centre]] (NRSC), Hyderabad, AP. The project slowly blossomed into a full-fledged one, Due to the sincere work done by Dr. A. Narendra Nath.  As a result of this, the project was separated from NRSC and a new organization was instituted to look after it. The new organization so formed was named as an Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS) and was placed under reputed scientist Dr A.Narendra Nath, Who was also the founder director for INCOIS.  Since its Inception in February 1998.   Dr. Narendra Nath is the person who initiated the PFZ  Mission.. The newly formed entity had potential fishing zone (PFZ) advisories as its major project. Apart  from PFZ services, the other services such as Indian Early Tsunami Warning, Ocean State Forecast, Ocean Modeling, Data and Web Services Management were also initiated and their products are being delivered to various stakeholders in the country on a daily basis. In recognition of these services, INCOIS was identified as one of the key International Oceanic Organizations. INCOIS renders its services through its web portal and various other devices that are installed at different places in the country.

==Potential Fishing Zone (PFZ)==

This is the first advisory service started by INCOIS. The backbone of this service is the real-time data for ocean color and SST provided by the OCEANSAT and NOAA respectively. This service was started because there was a need to identify the potential fishing zones to help the fishermen to get better catch while they were at the sea. This service was started by the Ministry of Earth Sciences with the help of the Department of Space and several institutions under the Ministry of Agriculture. These organizations are collaborating with the State Governments of the beneficiary states to offer these services to the end users.

This service makes use of parameters such as sea surface temperature and chlorophyll content provided by NOAA-AVHRR and Oceancolor satellites. Features such as oceanic fronts, Meandering Patterns, Eddies, Rings, Up Welling areas etc. are identified sites for fish accumulation. These features can easily be identified from Sea Surface Temperature and Chlorophyll data. The availability of Chlorophyll from OCEANSAT and MOdDIS has further enriched these advisories in the recent years. Hence, PFZ advisories have helped the fishing community to locate the fishing zones with accuracy.

Another feature of PFZ service is the generation of species-specific advisory to enable the fishermen folk to distinguish between the exploited and under-exploited species in the potential fishing zones. This enables them to have sustainable fishery management by targeting only the under-exploited species in the fishing zones. This approach enables them to avoid fishing the over-exploited species over and over again. One such species-specific advisory is Tuna Fisheries Forecasting System that enables the fishing community to adequately prepare for the Tuna catch. Being a highly migratory fish, it inhabits a wide range of ecosystems and wide area. Hence the fishing of tuna is a costly affair and it requires resource-specific orientation such as long lining by the fishing boats and trawlers. With the help of the parameters such as Oceanic Fronts, water clarity and sea surface temperature we can trace the distribution of tuna species.

==Tsunami Early Warning System (TEWS)==

In the aftermath of Sumatra earthquake in 2004 and the killer tsunami it set off, the Government of India wanted to set up an early warning centre for tsunami and other storm surges in the Indian Ocean region. Accordingly, on 15 October 2007, a centre housing the Indian Tsunami Early Warning System (TEWS) was established in INCOIS by the Ministry of Earth Sciences, the nodal ministry, with the collaboration of the Department of Science and Technology (DST), Department of Space (DOS), and Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR). At the time of its establishment, the centre had the mandate to provide important tsunami advisories to the people living in the coastal areas of the country. For this purpose, the center was equipped with state-of-the-art infrastructure and well trained manpower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2618/stories/20090911261811000.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629053728/http://www.hindu.com/fline/fl2618/stories/20090911261811000.htm |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 2012, the centre has started to give a round-the-clock alert and advisory services to all Indian Ocean Rim Countries (IOR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629053545/http://www.hindu.com/2011/02/05/stories/2011020551391100.htm|archivedate=29 June 2011|url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/02/05/stories/2011020551391100.htm |title= Indian Tsunami Early Warning Centre to turn regional provider  | date=5 February 2011 | newspaper=The Hindu | accessdate=7 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At present, the tsunami warning centre receives data from 17 seismic stations of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), 10 stations of the [[Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology]] (WIHG) and more than 300 international stations. In addition, it receives data from 17 sea-level tide gauges at intervals of five minutes. These tide gauges have been positioned at [[Aerial Bay]], [[Chennai]], [[Ennore]], [[Garden Reach]], [[Haldia]], [[Kandla]], [[Karwar]], [[Krishnapatnam]], [[Marmagao]], [[Machilipatnam]], [[Nagapattinam]], [[Paradeep]], [[Port Blair]], [[Vadinar]], [[Visakhapatnam]] etc. Apart from sea-level tide sensors, the wave-rider buoys have also been installed at various locations. This network of tide gauges and buoys helps the center to validate the arrivals of tsunami waves in the Indian Ocean region. To further supplement the cause, a network of seismographs has also been installed at appropriate positions to forecast the occurrence of tsunami-producing earthquakes. It has also installed three bottom pressure recorders in different regions to supplement its needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629053715/http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/13/stories/2011031355351200.htm | archivedate=29 June 2011 | url=http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/13/stories/2011031355351200.htm | title=Efficacy of Indian Early Tsunami Warning System proved | first=M.L. Melly | last=Maitreyi | newspaper=The Hindu |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the data obtained from a network of equipments, models have been run to provide maps depicting inundation scenarios for the entire coastal belt. Based on these scenarios, the potential risk zones are identified to generate advisories for various stakeholders in the region. When there is a disaster, the advisories are generated in intervals telling the location of the storm surges or tsunamis to help the local government authorities to evacuate the people from the regions that are likely to be affected.

== Ocean State Forecast (OSF)==
[[File:OCEANSAT-II Ground station.JPG|150px|thumbnail|Ground station of OCEANSAT-II, located inside the INCOIS campus]]
Being a peninsula, India is covered from three sides with water body. Hence there is a need for knowing the state of ocean in advance for carrying out various commercial activities. Prior information about the state of the ocean helps us to plan and execute our activities in the marine environment safely. Moreover, the ocean has an effect on the local climate as well. Thinking about all these factors, a new service was rolled out to forecast the ocean state, which is capable of predicting the surface and sub-surface features of the Indian Ocean in advance. It is called the Indian Ocean Forecasting System (INDOFOS). The forecast is also passed to the stakeholders through Village Information Centers, All India Radio, FM Radio, Digital Display Boards, NGO Websites, and TV channels in the regional languages.

At present, OSF gives forecasts of wave height and direction, sea surface temperature, sea surface currents, mixed layer depth, and depth of 20 degree isotherm. These forecasts are generated by state-of-the art numerical models. These models are customized to simulate and predict the Indian Ocean features realistically. Different models used for forecasts are WAVEWATCH III, WAM, Mike and Regional Ocean Modeling Systems (ROMS). In the forecast mode, these models are forced with atmospheric products developed by various Meteorological agencies to generate different forecasts. Apart from these services, the OSF center also offers value-added services for the benefit of its end users.

The generated forecasts fall under four categories. They are global, regional, location-specific and coastal forecasts. They differ in spatial and temporal resolutions extend of validations. For coastal forecast, the models are set up with the concept of "coarse grid" with coarse resolution in open ocean region whereas very fine resolution is used for location-specific forecasts. These models are tested for their accuracy and reliability by comparing their output with the data from satellite and in-situ measurements. The validation is mainly done during the extreme conditions and monsoon seasons.

==Ocean Observation Group (OOG)==

The main activity of this group in INCOIS is to measure and monitor the surface temperature and salinity of the upper 2000 meters of the ocean. For this purpose, there is a global array of 3000 free-drifting, profiling floats that relay the measurement data to agencies, which in turn make available these data publicly within hours of reception. This will help them to continuously monitor the climate state of the ocean. This system was named as Argo, which emphasizes the strong complementary relationship between the free-drifting floats and Jason altimeter mission.

Basically, Argo builds on the existing upper-ocean thermal networks, extending their spatial and temporal coverage, depth range and accuracy, and improving them through the addition of salinity and velocity measurements. The Argo system helps to study quantitatively the evolving state of the upper ocean and the patterns of its climate variability, including heat, fresh water storage and transport. Apart from these,it also enhances the value of altimeter by sufficiently improving the coverage and resolution of sea surface height variability interpretation and initializes the ocean and coupled forecast models for data assimilation and dynamic model testing.

'''Low flying military training''' involves [[military aircraft]] flying at low altitude to prepare their [[aircrew]], and other military personnel (e.g. [[air defence]] troops), for [[nap-of-the-earth]] flying in wartime. The aircraft types can include advanced [[Trainer (aircraft)|trainers]], [[ground-attack aircraft]], [[Military transport aircraft|transports]] and [[Military helicopter|helicopters]].

Some countries have sufficiently large [[military reservation]]s for such training to take place without affecting the civilian population.  In smaller countries, such as in Europe, there can be tension between the military and the local population—mainly because of [[aircraft noise]].

==Hazards==
Low-level flying involves [[air safety]] hazards such as: 
* Collision with the ground, electricity wires etc. as a result of pilot error (e.g. [[Cavalese cable car disaster (1998)|Cavalese, 1998]]) or failure of aircraft systems - at low level and high speed there is little time to react to any problem.
* [[Mid-air collision]] with light aircraft (e.g. [[1974 Norfolk mid-air collision|Norfolk, 1974]]) or other military aircraft.
* [[Bird strike]].

The noise can also disturb animals and hence cause a hazard to horse-riders etc.{{refn|group=Note|On 10 June 2003 a RAF [[Boeing Chinook (UK variants)|Chinook HC2]] pilot flew low over horseriders in rural Lincolnshire. This caused one horse to behave uncontrollably and resulted in the death of the rider. At a subsequent inquest, the death was blamed upon the actions of the pilot while operating under inappropriate low flying rules from the UK Ministry Of Defence. The UK MOD undertook a review of their policies and raised the minimum flight height as a result.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/lincolnshire/3958685.stm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==By country==

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Low-flying Tornado near Grasmere - geograph.org.uk - 366344.jpg|thumb|Low flying [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]] near Grasmere, UK]]
In the UK, ''low flying'' means fixed-wing aircraft at less than 2000 feet from the ground or light propeller driven aircraft and helicopters below 500 feet from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/AirSafetyandAviation/LowFlying (accessed 11 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Low flying is permitted across the majority of the UK except for large urban areas, civil airports and some industrial and medical sites.  Fixed-wing aircraft can fly down to 250&amp;nbsp;ft above ground level at a speed of up to 450&amp;nbsp;kt.  Lower height limits apply for helicopters and in certain parts of mid Wales, Northern England and Northern Scotland, designated ''Tactical Training Areas''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/22A9CEDC-4069-4E68-AE77-15317255935B/0/UK_Military_Low_Flying.pdf page 7 (accessed 11 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

For safety and to minimise disturbance to the public, military aircrew training at low level is constrained by rules.  A specialist military police unit conducts covert monitoring using [[Skyguard radar|mobile radar]] and investigates alleged infringements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/22A9CEDC-4069-4E68-AE77-15317255935B/0/UK_Military_Low_Flying.pdf page 10 (accessed 11 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MAGEN''' (Masking Gateway for Enterprises) is [[information security]] technology designed by [[IBM R&amp;D Labs in Israel#Haifa Research Lab|IBM's Haifa Research Lab]].  MAGEN is designed to keep users from viewing discrete chunks of secret or sensitive data on their screens that they are not authorized to see.

MAGEN applies a sort of inverse [[highlighter|highlighting]] on the data in question in real time as it is rendered on the screen.  This allows "[[Classified information|eyes only]]" business logic to be implemented once, at the screen, rather than within each affected application.

MAGEN leverages a combination of [[optical character recognition]] and [[screen scraping]] techniques.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36838">'''Magnetic tweezers (MT)''' are scientific instruments for the manipulation and characterization of  biomolecules or polymers. These apparatus exert forces and torques to individual molecules or groups of molecules. It can be used to measure the tensile strength or the force generated by molecules.

Most commonly magnetic tweezers are used to study mechanical properties of biological macromolecules like [[DNA]] or [[proteins]] in [[single-molecule experiment]]s. Other applications are the [[rheology]] of [[soft matter]], and studies of force-regulated processes in living cells. Forces are typically on the order of pico- to nanonewtons. Due to their simple architecture, magnetic tweezers are a popular [[biophysical]] tool.

In experiments, the molecule of interest is attached to a magnetic microparticle. The magnetic tweezer is equipped with magnets that are used to manipulate the magnetic particles whose position is measured with the help of video microscopy.

==Construction principle and physics of magnetic tweezers==
A magnetic tweezers apparatus consists of magnetic micro-particles, which can be manipulated with the help of an external magnetic field. The position of the magnetic particles is then determined by a microscopic objective with a camera.

===Magnetic particles===
Magnetic particles for the operation in magnetic tweezers come with a wide range of properties and have to be chosen according to the intended application. Two basic types of magnetic particles are described in the following paragraphs; however there are also others like magnetic nanoparticles in [[ferrofluid]]s, which allow experiments inside a cell.

; Superparamagnetic beads
[[Superparamagnetism|Superparamagnetic]] beads are commercially available with a number of different characteristics. The most common is the use of spherical particles of a diameter in the micrometer range. They consist of a porous latex matrix in which magnetic nanoparticles have been embedded. Latex is [[Autofluorescence|auto-fluorescent]] and may therefore be advantageous for the imaging of their position. Irregular shaped particles present a larger surface and hence a higher probability to bind to the molecules to be studied.&lt;ref name=Tanase07&gt;{{cite book|last=Tanase|last2=Biais|last3=Sheetz|first=Monica|first2=Nicolas|first3=Michael|editor-first=Yu-li|editor2-first=Dennis E.|editor-last=Wang |editor2-last=Discher|series =Methods in Cell Biology|volume =83|title=Cell Mechanics|publisher=Elsevier Inc.|year=2007|pages=473–493|chapter=Chapter 20: Magnetic Tweezers in Cell Biology|isbn=978-0-12-370500-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coating of the microbeads may also contain ligands able to attach the molecules of interest. For example, the coating may contain [[streptavidin]] which couples strongly to [[biotin]], which itself may be bound to the molecules of interest.

When exposed to an external magnetic field, these microbeads become magnetized. The induced magnetic moment &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{m}(\overrightarrow{B}) &lt;/math&gt; is proportional to a weak external magnetic field &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{B} &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{m}(\overrightarrow{B}) = \frac{V \chi \overrightarrow{B}}{\mu_0} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mu_0 &lt;/math&gt; is the [[vacuum permeability]]. It is also proportional to the volume &lt;math&gt;V &lt;/math&gt; of the [[microsphere]]s, which stems from the fact that the number of magnetic [[nanoparticle]]s scales with the size of the bead. The magnetic susceptibility &lt;math&gt;\chi &lt;/math&gt; is assumed to be scalar in this first estimation and may be calculated by &lt;math&gt; \chi = 3 \frac{\mu_r-1}{\mu_r+2} &lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; \mu_r &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)#Relative permeability|relative permeability]]. In a strong external field, the induced magnetic moment saturates at a material dependent value &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{m}_{sat} &lt;/math&gt;. The force &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{F} &lt;/math&gt; experienced by a microbead can be derived from the potential &lt;math&gt;U =- \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{m}(\overrightarrow{B}) \cdot  \overrightarrow{B} &lt;/math&gt; of this magnetic moment in an outer magnetic field:&lt;ref name=Lipfert09&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lipfert| first = Jan| last2 = Hao| first2 = Xiaomin| last3 = Dekker| first3 = Nynke H.| title = Quantitative Modeling and Optimization of Magnetic Tweezers | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 96 | issue = 12 | pages = 5040–5049 | publisher = Cell Press | date = June 2009 | url =https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2712044/pdf/main.pdf | issn = 0006-3495| doi =10.1016/j.bpj.2009.03.055 | pmc=2712044 | pmid=19527664|bibcode = 2009BpJ....96.5040L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{F}= - \overrightarrow{\nabla}U=  \begin{cases} \frac{V \chi}{2 \mu_0} \overrightarrow{\nabla}\left| \overrightarrow{B} \right|^2 &amp; \qquad \text{in a weak magnetic field} \\ \frac{1}{2} \overrightarrow{\nabla} \left( \overrightarrow{m}_{sat} \cdot \overrightarrow{B} \right) &amp; \qquad \text{in a strong magnetic field}  \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

The outer magnetic field can be evaluated numerically with the help of [[Finite element method|finite element analysis]] or by simply measuring the magnetic field with the help of a [[Hall effect sensor]]. Theoretically it would be possible to calculate the force on the beads with these formulae; however the results are not very reliable due to uncertainties of the involved variables, but they allow estimating the order of magnitude and help to better understand the system. More accurate numerical values can be obtained considering the [[Brownian motion]] of the beads.

Due to [[anisotropy|anisotropies]] in the stochastic distribution of the nanoparticles within the microbead the magnetic moment is not perfectly aligned with the outer magnetic field i.e. the [[Magnetic susceptibility|magnetic susceptibility tensor]] cannot be reduced to a scalar. For this reason, the beads are also subjected to a torque &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{\Gamma} &lt;/math&gt;which tries to align &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{m} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{B} &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; \overrightarrow{\Gamma} =  \overrightarrow{m} \times \overrightarrow{B}  &lt;/math&gt;

The torques generated by this method are typically much greater than &lt;math&gt; 10^3 \mathrm{pNnm}&lt;/math&gt;, which is more than necessary to twist the molecules of interest.&lt;ref name=Neuman08&gt;{{cite journal | last = Neuman| first = Keir C| last2 = Nagy | first2 = Attila | title = Single-molecule force spectroscopy: optical tweezers, magnetic tweezers and atomic force microscopy | journal = Nature Methods | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 491–505 | publisher = Nature Publishing Group | date = June 2008 | url = http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v5/n6/full/nmeth.1218.html | issn = 1548-7091 | doi = 10.1038/NMETH.1218 | pmid = 18511917 | pmc = 3397402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Ferromagnetic nanowires
The use of ferromagnetic nanowires for the operation of magnetic tweezers enlarges their experimental application range. The length of these wires typically is in the order of tens of nanometers up to tens of micrometers, which is much larger than their diameter. In comparison with superparamagnetic beads, they allow the application of much larger forces and torques. In addition to that, they present a remnant magnetic moment. This allows the operation in weak magnetic field strengths. It is possible to produce nanowires with surface segments that present different chemical properties, which allows controlling the position where the studied molecules can bind to the wire.&lt;ref name= Tanase07/&gt;

===Magnets===
To be able to exert torques on the microbeads at least two magnets are necessary, but many other configurations have been realized, reaching from only one magnet that only pulls the magnetic microbeads to a system of six electromagnets that allows fully controlling the 3-dimensional position and rotation via a [[feedback|digital feedback loop]].&lt;ref name=Croquette02&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gosse| first = Charlie | last2 = Croquette| first2 = Vincent| title =Magnetic Tweezers: Micromanipulation and Force Measurement at the Molecular Level | journal = Biophysical Journal | volume = 82 | issue = 6 | pages = 3314–3329 | publisher = Cell Press | date =June 2002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349502756725 | issn = 0006-3495 | doi =10.1016/S0006-3495(02)75672-5 | bibcode=2002BpJ....82.3314G | pmid = 12023254 | pmc = 1302119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magnetic field strength decreases roughly exponentially with the distance from the axis linking the two magnets on a typical scale of about the width of the gap between the magnets. Since this scale is rather large in comparison to the distances, when the microbead moves in an experiment, the force acting on it may be treated as constant. Therefore, magnetic tweezers are passive force clamps due to the nature of their construction in contrast to optical tweezers, although they may be used as positive clamps, too, when combined with a feedback loop. The field strength may be increased by sharpening the pole face of the magnet which, however, also diminishes the area where the field may be considered as constant. An iron ring connection the outer poles of the magnets may help to reduce stray fields. Magnetic tweezers can be operated with both, permanent magnets and electromagnets. The two techniques have their specific advantages.&lt;ref name= Neuman08/&gt;

; Permanent Magnets
Permanent magnets of magnetic tweezers are usually out of rare earth materials, like [[Neodymium magnet|neodymium]] and can reach field strengths exceeding 1.3 Tesla. The force on the beads may be controlled by moving the magnets along the vertical axis. Moving them up decreases the field strength at the position of the bead and vice versa. Torques on the magnetic beads may be exerted by turning the magnets around the vertical axis to change the direction of the field. The size of the magnets is in the order of millimeters as well as their spacing.&lt;ref name= Neuman08/&gt;

; Electromagnets
The use of electromagnets in magnetic tweezers has the advantage that the field strength and direction can be changed just by adjusting the amplitude and the phase of the current for the magnets. For this reason, the magnets do not need to be moved which allows a faster control of the system and reduces mechanical noise. In order to increase the maximum field strength, a core of a soft paramagnetic material with high saturation and low [[remanence]] may be added to the solenoid. In any case, however, the typical field strengths are much lower compared to those of permanent magnets of comparable size. Additionally, using electromagnets requires high currents that produce heat that may necessitate a cooling system.&lt;ref name= Tanase07/&gt;

===Bead tracking system===
The displacement of the magnetic beads corresponds to the response of the system to the imposed magnetic field and hence needs to be precisely measured: In a typical set-up, the experimental volume is illuminated from the top so that the beads produce diffraction rings in the focal plane of an objective which is placed under the tethering surface. The diffraction pattern is then recorded by a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD-camera]]. The image can be analyzed in real time by a computer. The detection of the position in the plane of the tethering surface is not complicated since it corresponds to the center of the diffraction rings. The precision can be up to a few nanometers. For the position along the vertical axis, the diffraction pattern needs to be compared to reference images, which show the diffraction pattern of the considered bead in a number of known distances from the focal plane. These calibration images are obtained by keeping a bead fixed while displacing the objective, i.e. the focal plane, with the help of piezoelectric elements by known distances. With the help of interpolation, the resolution can reach precision of up 10&amp;nbsp;nm along this axis.&lt;ref name=Vilfan09&gt;{{cite book|last=Vilfan|last2=Lipfert|last3=Koster|last4=Lemay|last5=Dekker|first=I. D.|first2=J.|first3=D. A.|first4=S. G.|first5=N. H.|editor-first=Peter|editor2-first=Antoine|editor-last=Hinterdorfer |editor2-last=van Oijen|title=Handbook of Single-Molecule Biophysics|publisher=Springer|year=2009|pages=371–395|chapter=Chapter 13: Magnetic Tweezers for Single-Molecule Experiments|isbn=978-0-387-76496-2| doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-76497-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The obtained coordinates may be used as input for a digital feedback loop that controls the magnetic field strength, for example, in order to keep the bead at a certain position.

Non-magnetic beads are usually also added to the sample as a reference to provide a background displacement vector. They have a different diameter as the magnetic beads so that they are optically distinguishable. This is necessary to detect potential drift of the fluid. For example, if the density of magnetic particles is too high, they may drag the surrounding viscous fluid with them. The displacement vector of a magnetic bead can be determined by subtracting its initial position vector and this background displacement vector from its current position.

==Force Calibration==
The determination of the force that is exerted by the magnetic field on the magnetic beads can be calculated considering thermal fluctuations of the bead in the horizontal plane: The problem is rotational symmetric with respect to the vertical axis; hereafter one arbitrarily picked direction in the symmetry plane is called &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The analysis is the same for the direction orthogonal to the x-direction and may be used to increase precision. If the bead leaves its equilibrium position on the &lt;math&gt;x &lt;/math&gt;-axis by &lt;math&gt;\delta x &lt;/math&gt; due to thermal fluctuations, it will be subjected to a restoring force &lt;math&gt;F_{\chi} &lt;/math&gt; that increases linearly with &lt;math&gt;\delta x &lt;/math&gt; in the first order approximation. Considering only absolute values of the involved vectors it is geometrically clear that the proportionality constant is the force exerted by the magnets &lt;math&gt;F &lt;/math&gt; over the length &lt;math&gt;l &lt;/math&gt; of the molecule that keeps the bead anchored to the tethering surface:
[[File:Magnetic tweezers2.svg|thumb|alt=Magnetic bead anchored to a surface by a molecule of length l. It is pulled up by a force F and if deviated horizontally by thermal fluctuations by delta x an additional restoring force F_r acts on the bead. |Geometry of the forces acting on the magnetic bead.]]

&lt;math&gt;F_{\chi} = \frac{F}{l} \delta x &lt;/math&gt;.

The [[equipartition theorem]] states that the mean energy that is stored in this "spring" is equal to &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{2} k_BT &lt;/math&gt; per degree of freedom. Since only one direction is considered here, the potential energy of the system reads:
&lt;math&gt; \langle E_p \rangle= \frac{1}{2} \frac{F}{l}  \langle \delta x^2 \rangle = \frac{1}{2} k_BT &lt;/math&gt;.
From this, a first estimate for the force acting on the bead can be deduced:

&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{lk_BT}{  \langle \delta x^2 \rangle} &lt;/math&gt;.

For a more accurate calibration, however, an analysis in Fourier space is necessary. The [[Spectral density|power spectrum density]] &lt;math&gt;P(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; of the position of the bead is experimentally available. A theoretical expression for this spectrum is derived in the following, which can then be fitted to the experimental curve in order to obtain the force exerted by the magnets on the bead as a fitting parameter. By definition this spectrum is the squared modulus of the [[Fourier transform]] of the position &lt;math&gt; X(\omega) &lt;/math&gt; over the spectral bandwidth  &lt;math&gt; \Delta f &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt; P(\omega) = \frac{\left| X(\omega)\right|^2}{\Delta f} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; X(\omega)&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained considering the equation of motion for a bead of mass &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;m \frac{\partial^2 x(t)}{\partial t^2} = -6 \pi R \eta \frac{\partial x(t)}{\partial t}-\frac{F}{l}x(t)+f(t) &lt;/math&gt;

The term &lt;math&gt; 6 \pi R \eta \frac{\partial x(t)}{\partial t} &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the [[Stokes' law|Stokes friction force]] for a spherical particle of radius &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt; in a medium of viscosity &lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \frac{F}{l}x(t) &lt;/math&gt; is the restoring force which is opposed to the stochastic force &lt;math&gt; f(t) &lt;/math&gt; due to the Brownian motion. Here, one may neglect the inertial term &lt;math&gt;m \frac{\partial^2 x(t)}{\partial t^2}&lt;/math&gt;, because the system is in a regime of very low [[Reynolds number]] &lt;math&gt;\left(\mathrm{Re}&lt;10^{-5}\right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name = Tanase07/&gt;

The equation of motion can be Fourier transformed inserting the driving force and the position in Fourier space:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
 f(t) = &amp; \frac{1}{2\pi} \int F(\omega) \mathrm{e}^{i\omega t} \mathrm{d}t \\
 x(t) = &amp; \frac{1}{2\pi} \int X(\omega) \mathrm{e}^{i\omega t} \mathrm{d}t.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This leads to:

&lt;math&gt;  X(\omega) = \frac{F(\omega)}{6\pi i R \eta \omega + \frac{F}{l}} &lt;/math&gt;.

The power spectral density of the stochastic force &lt;math&gt; F(\omega) &lt;/math&gt; can be derived by using the equipartition theorem and the fact that Brownian collisions are completely uncorrelated:&lt;ref name=DeGroth99&gt;{{cite journal | last = de Groth| first = Barth G.| title = A simple model for Brownian motion leading to the Langevin equation | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 67 | issue = 12 | pages = 1248–1252 | publisher = American Association of Physics Teachers | year = 1999 | url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/67/1248/1 | issn = 0002-9505 | doi = 10.1119/1.19111|bibcode = 1999AmJPh..67.1248D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\left|F(\omega)\right|^2}{\Delta f} = 4k_BT \cdot 6 \pi \eta R &lt;/math&gt;

This corresponds to the [[Fluctuation-dissipation theorem]]. With that expression, it is possible to give a theoretical expression for the power spectrum:

&lt;math&gt; P(\omega) = \frac{24 \pi k_BT\eta R}{36\pi^2 R^2 \eta^2 \omega^2 + \left(\frac{F}{l}\right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The only unknown in this expression, &lt;math&gt; F &lt;/math&gt;, can be determined by fitting this expression to the experimental power spectrum. For more accurate results, one may subtract the effect due to finite camera integration time from the experimental spectrum before doing the fit.&lt;ref name=Vilfan09/&gt;

Another force calibration method is to use the viscous drag of the microbeads: Therefore, the microbeads are pulled through the viscous medium while recording their position. Since the Reynolds number for the system is very low, it is possible to apply Stokes law to calculate the friction force which is in equilibrium with the force exerted by the magnets:

&lt;math&gt; F=6\pi \eta R v &lt;/math&gt;.

The velocity &lt;math&gt; v &lt;/math&gt; can be determined by using the recorded velocity values. The force obtained via this formula can then be related to a given configuration of the magnets, which may serve as a calibration.&lt;ref name=Haber00&gt;{{cite journal | last = Haber| first = Charbel| last2 = Wirtz| first2 = Denis| title = Magnetic tweezers for DNA micromanipulation | journal = Review of Scientific Instruments | volume = 71 | issue = 12 | pages = 4561–4570 | publisher = American Institute of Physics | date = December 2000 | url =http://folk.uio.no/dansh/pdf/author/haber00MT_RSI.pdf | issn = 0034-6748 | doi = 10.1063/1.1326056|bibcode = 2000RScI...71.4561H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical experimental set-up==

[[File:DNA twist simple.svg|thumb|alt=Three schematic torsion-extension curves of a DNA molecule at different stretching forces. For the lowest force, the extension shrinks for both, positive and negative torsion and the curve is symmetric for the positive and negative torsion branch. For intermediate forces, the extension diminishes only for positive turns and for the highest forces it stays constant. The number of turns is in the order of hundreds, and the extension is typically in the order of micrometers.|Schematic torsion extension curves of DNA at different forces in the pico Newton range.]]

This section gives an example for an experiment carried out by Strick, Allemand, Croquette&lt;ref name="Strick98"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Strick| first = T.

A double-stranded DNA molecule is fixed with multiple binding sites on one end to a glass surface and on the other to a magnetic micro bead, which can be manipulated in a magnetic tweezers apparatus. By turning the magnets, torsional stress can be applied to the DNA molecule. Rotations in the sense of the DNA helix are counted positively and vice versa. While twisting, the magnetic tweezers also allow stretching the DNA molecule. This way, torsion extension curves may be recorded at different stretching forces. For low forces (less than about 0.5 pN), the DNA forms supercoils, so called plectonemes, which decrease the extension of the DNA molecule quite symmetrically for positive and negative twists. Augmenting the pulling force already increases the extension for zero imposed torsion. Positive twists lead again to plectoneme formation that reduces the extension. Negative twist, however, does not change the extension of the DNA molecule a lot. This can be interpreted as the separation of the two strands which corresponds to the [[Denaturation (biochemistry)#Nucleic acid denaturation|denaturation]] of the molecule. In the high force regime, the extension is nearly independent of the applied torsional stress. The interpretation is the apparition of local regions of highly overwound DNA. An important parameter of this experiment is also the ionic strength of the solution which affects the critical values of the applied pulling force that separate the three force regimes.&lt;ref name="Strick98" /&gt;

==History and development==
[[File:Francis Crick.jpg|thumb|149x149px|Crick at Cambridge University]]
Applying magnetic theory to the study of biology is a biophysical technique that started to appear in Germany in the early 1920s. Possibly the first demonstration was published by Alfred Heilbronn in 1922; his work looked at [[viscosity]] of [[protoplast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Heilbronn | first1 = A | year = 1922 | title = Eine neue methode zur bestimmung der viskosität lebender protoplasten | url = | journal = Jahrb. Wiss. Bot | volume = 61 | issue = | page = 284 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Freundlich and Seifriz explored [[rheology]] in [[echinoderm]] eggs. Both studies included insertion of magnetic particles into cells and resulting movement observations in a [[magnetic field]] [[gradient]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kollmannsberger|first=Philip|last2=Fabry|first2=Ben|date=2007-11-01|title=BaHigh-force magnetic tweezers with force feedback for biological applications|url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/rsi/78/11/10.1063/1.2804771|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|volume=78|issue=11|pages=114301|doi=10.1063/1.2804771|issn=0034-6748|bibcode=2007RScI...78k4301K}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Honor Fell 2.jpg|thumb|151x151px|Dr. Fell at her lab in Cambridge in the 1950s]]
In 1949 at Cambridge University, [[Francis Crick]] and Arthur Hughes demonstrated a novel use of the technique, calling it "The Magnetic Particle Method." The idea, which originally came from Dr. [[Honor Fell]], was that tiny magnetic beads, [[Phagocytosis|phagocytoced]] by whole cells grown in culture, could be manipulated by an external magnetic field  The tissue culture was allowed to grow in the presence of the magnetic material, and cells that contained a magnetic particle could be seen with a high power microscope. As the magnetic particle was moved through the cell by a magnetic field, measurements about the physical properties of the [[cytoplasm]] were made.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crick|first=F.H.C.|last2=Hughes|first2=A.F.W.|title=The physical properties of cytoplasm|journal=Experimental Cell Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=37–80|doi=10.1016/0014-4827(50)90048-6|year=1950}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although some of their methods and measurements were self-admittedly crude, their work demonstrated the usefulness of magnetic field particle manipulation and paved the way for further developments of this technique. The magnetic particle phagocytosis method continued to be used for many years to research cytoplasm [[rheology]] and other physical properties in whole cells.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Valberg|first=P.

An innovation in the 1990s lead to an expansion of the technique's usefulness in a way that was similar to the then-emerging [[Optical tweezers|optical tweezers method]]. Chemically linking an individual [[DNA|DNA molecule]] between a magnetic bead and a glass slide allowed researchers to manipulate a single DNA molecule with an external magnetic field. Upon application of [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional forces]] to the molecule, deviations from free-form movement could be measured against theoretical standard force curves or [[Brownian motion]] analysis.

Magnetic tweezers as an experimental technique has become exceptionally diverse in use and application. More recently, the introduction of even more novel methods have been discovered or proposed. Since 2002, the potential for experiments involving many tethering molecules and parallel magnetic beads has been explored, shedding light on interaction mechanics, especially in the case of [[DNA-binding protein]]s.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Vlaminck|first=Iwijn|last2=Dekker|first2=Cees|date=2012-05-11|title=Recent Advances in Magnetic Tweezers|url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-biophys-122311-100544|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics|volume=41|issue=1|pages=453–472|doi=10.1146/annurev-biophys-122311-100544|issn=1936-122X|pmid=22443989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A technique was published in 2005 that involved coating a magnetic bead with a [[Receptor (biochemistry)|molecular receptor]] and the glass slide with its [[Ligand (biochemistry)|ligand]].

==Biological applications==
&lt;nowiki/&gt;

===Magnetic tweezer rheology===
Magnetic tweezers can be used to measure mechanical properties such as [[rheology]], the study of matter flow and elasticity, in whole cells. The [[phagocytosis]] method previously described is useful for capturing a magnetic bead inside a cell. Measuring the movement of the beads inside the cell in response to manipulation from the external magnetic field yields information on the physical environment inside the cell and internal media rheology: viscosity of the cytoplasm, rigidity of internal structure, and ease of particle flow.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

A whole cell may also be magnetically manipulated by attaching a magnetic bead to the [[extracellular matrix]] via [[fibronectin]]-coated magnetic beads. Fibronectin is a protein that will bind to extracellular [[membrane protein]]s. This technique allows for measurements of cell stiffness and provides insights into the functioning of structural proteins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The schematic shown at right depicts the experimental setup devised by Bonakdar and Schilling, et al. (2015)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; for studying the structural protein [[plectin]] in mouse cells. Stiffness was measured as proportional to bead position in response to external magnetic manipulation.

===Single-molecule experiments===
Magnetic tweezers as a [[Single-molecule experiment|single-molecule method]] is decidedly the most common use in recent years. Through the single-molecule method, molecular tweezers provide a close look into the physical and mechanical properties of biological [[macromolecule]]s. Similar to other single-molecule methods, such as [[optical tweezers]], this method provides a way to isolate and manipulate an individual molecule free from the influences of surrounding molecules.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Here, the magnetic bead is attached to a tethering surface by the molecule of interest. DNA or RNA may be tethered in either single-stranded or double-stranded form, or entire structural motifs can be tethered, such as [[Holliday junction|DNA Holliday junctions]], [[DNA hairpin]]s, or entire [[nucleosome]]s and [[chromatin]]. By acting upon the magnetic bead with the magnetic field, different types of [[Torsion (mechanics)|torsional force]] can be applied to study intra-DNA interactions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berghuis|first=Bojk A.|last2=Köber|first2=Mariana|last3=van Laar|first3=Theo|last4=Dekker|first4=Nynke H.|date=2016-08-01|title=High-throughput, high-force probing of DNA-protein interactions with magnetic tweezers|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1046202316300597|journal=Methods|series=Single molecule probing by fluorescence and force detection|volume=105|pages=90–98|doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2016.03.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as interactions with [[topoisomerase]]s or [[histone]]s in [[chromosome]]s .&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Single-complex studies===
Magnetic tweezers go beyond the capabilities of other single-molecule methods, however, in that interactions between and within complexes can also be observed. This has allowed recent advances in understanding more about [[DNA-binding protein]]s, receptor-ligand interactions,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; and restriction enzyme cleavage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A more recent application of magnetic tweezers is seen in single-complex studies. With the help of DNA as the tethering agent, an entire molecular complex may be attached between the bead and the tethering surface. In exactly the same way as with pulling a DNA hairpin apart by applying a force to the magnetic bead, an entire complex can be pulled apart and force required for the dissociation can be measured.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This is also similar to the method of pulling apart receptor-ligand interactions with magnetic tweezers to measure dissociation force.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

==Comparison to other techniques==

This section compares the features of magnetic tweezers with those of the most important other single-molecule experimental methods: [[optical tweezers]] and  [[atomic force microscopy]]. The magnetic interaction is highly specific to the used superparamagnetic microbeads. The magnetic field does practically not affect the sample. Optical tweezers have the problem that the laser beam may also interact with other particles of the biological sample due to contrasts in the [[refractive index]]. In addition to that, the laser may cause photodamage and sample heating. In the case of atomic force microscopy, it may also be hard to discriminate the interaction of the tip with the studied molecule from other nonspecific interactions.

Thanks to the low trap stiffness, the range of forces accessible with magnetic tweezers is lower in comparison with the two other techniques. The possibility to exert torque with magnetic tweezers is not unique: optically tweezers may also offer this feature when operated with [[Birefringence|birefringent]] microbeads in combination with a circularly polarized laser beam.

Another advantage of magnetic tweezers is that it is easy to carry out in parallel many single molecule measurements.

An important drawback of magnetic tweezers is the low temporal and spatial resolution due to the data acquisition via video-microscopy.&lt;ref name = Neuman08/&gt; However, with the addition of a high-speed camera, the temporal and spatial resolution has been demonstrated to reach the Angstrom-level.&lt;ref name=LansdorpMT13&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lansdorp|first=Bob M.|author2=Tabrizi, Shawn J. |author3=Dittmore, Andrew |author4= Saleh, Omar A. |title=A high-speed magnetic tweezer beyond 10,000 frames per second|journal=Review of Scientific Instruments|date=April 2013|volume=84|issue=4|pages=044301|doi=10.1063/1.4802678|url=http://link.aip.org/link/doi/10.1063/1.4802678|pmid=23635212|bibcode = 2013RScI...84d4301L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3352">"'''Nature Farming'''" was established in 1936 by [[Mokichi Okada]], the founder of the [[Church of World Messianity]], an agricultural system originally called "no fertilizer farming" or {{nihongo|[[:ja:自然農法|自然農法]]|shizen nōhō}} in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Agriculture: Definition and Terms. Special Reference Briefs Series no. SRB 99-02, September 1999. Compiled by: Mary V. Gold, Alternative Farming Systems Information Center, U.S. Department of Agriculture&lt;/ref&gt;

Offshoots such as the Sekai Kyusei Kyo, promoting ‘Kyusei nature farming’, and the Mokichi Okada Association formed after his death to continue promoting the work in Japan and South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Setboonsarng, S. and Gilman, J. 1999. Alternative Agriculture in Thailand and Japan. HORIZON Communications, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut.&lt;/ref&gt;

ZZ2, a farming conglomerate in South Africa has translated the term to [[Afrikaans]], "Natuurboerdery".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Silent|first=Taurayi,|title=An investigation of natuurboerdery (natural farming) approach : a ZZ2 case study|date=March 2011|publisher=Stellenbosch : University of Stellenbosch|url=http://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/6694|language=en-ZA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Nature Farming Research Center in [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]], Japan,&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Proof of Mokichi Okada's Nature Farming Theories by Xu, Hui-lian. Agricultural Experiment Station, International Nature Farming Research Center, Nagano&lt;/ref&gt; it is based on the theories that:
* [[Fertilizer]]s pollute the soil and weaken its power of production.
* [[Pest (organism)|Pests]] would break out from the excessive use of fertilizers
* The difference in disease incidence between resistant and susceptible plants is attributed to nutritional conditions inside the body.
* Vegetables and fruits produced by nature farming taste better than those by [[Industrial agriculture|chemical farming]].
The term is sometimes used for an alternative farming philosophy of [[Masanobu Fukuoka]].

==Natural Farming==
{{Main|Natural Farming}}
Another Japanese farmer and philosopher, [[Masanobu Fukuoka]], conceived of an alternative farming system in the 1930s separately from Okada and used the same Japanese characters to describe it.&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Xu|first=Hui-Lian|title=NATURE FARMING In Japan|url=http://www.ressign.com/UserBookDetail.aspx?bkid=460&amp;catid=140|accessdate=6 March 2011|type=Monograph|year=2001|publisher=Research Signpost|location=T. C. 37/661(2), Fort Post Office, Trivandrum - 695023, Kerala, India.|isbn=81-308-0111-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally translated in English as "[[Natural Farming]]" although agriculture researcher Hu-lian Xu claims that "nature farming" is the correct literal translation of the Japanese term.&lt;ref name="NATURE FARMING-Xu1" /&gt;

The neurodiversity movement describes itself as an international [[civil rights movements|civil rights movement]], of which the [[autism rights movement]] is its most influential submovement. Citing the classic legal maxim, "[[Nothing About Us Without Us]]", the movement promotes self-advocacy of its members. Neurodiversity advocates promote support systems (such as inclusion-focused services, accommodations, communication and assistive technologies, occupational training, and independent living support)&lt;ref name="ASAN"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://autisticadvocacy.org/policy-advocacy/position-statements/|title=Position Statements|publisher=Autistic Self Advocacy Network|accessdate=April 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that allow those who are "non-neurotypical" to live their lives as they are, rather than being coerced or forced to adopt what neurodiversity proponents see as uncritically accepted ideas of normality, or to conform to a clinical ideal.&lt;ref name="Syracuse"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://neurodiversitysymposium.wordpress.com/what-is-neurodiversity/|title=What is Neurodiversity?|publisher=National Symposium on Neurodiversity at Syracuse University|year=2011|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neurodiversity frames [[autism spectrum|autism]], dyslexia, and other neurological conditions as natural human variations rather than pathologies or disorders, and rejects the idea that neurological differences need to be (or can be) [[cure]]d, instead believing them to be authentic forms of human [[diversity (politics)|diversity]], self-expression, and being.

==Terminology==
According to the 2011 National Symposium on Neurodiversity held at [[Syracuse University]], neurodiversity is:

{{quote|... a concept where neurological differences are to be recognized and respected as any other human variation. These differences can include those labeled with Dyspraxia, Dyslexia, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Dyscalculia, Autistic Spectrum, Tourette Syndrome, and others.&lt;ref name="Syracuse"/&gt;}}

==Autism rights movement==
{{further|Autism rights movement}}
The [[autism rights movement]] (ARM) is a [[social movement]] within the neurodiversity movement that encourages autistic people, their caregivers and society to adopt a position of neurodiversity, accepting autism as a variation in functioning rather than a [[mental disorder]] to be cured.&lt;ref name="Solomon"&gt;{{cite news |work=New York |title=The autism rights movement |last=Solomon |first=Andrew |date=2008-05-25 |accessdate=2008-05-27 |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080527025140/http://nymag.com/news/features/47225/| archivedate= 27 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ARM advocates a variety of goals including a greater acceptance of autistic behaviors;&lt;ref name=AAP&gt;[http://www.taaproject.com/about-us/mission-statement/ Mission Statement.] Autism Acceptance Project.

Autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome. This perspective is distinct from two other views: the mainstream perspective that autism is caused by a genetic defect and should be addressed by targeting the genes that cause autism; and the perspective that autism is caused by environmental factors and could be cured by addressing environmental causes.&lt;ref name="Solomon"/&gt;

Many autistic supporters of autism rights describe themselves through words that emphasize the condition as an intrinsic part of their identity, such as "autistic", or "aspie" for those with [[Asperger syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Ortega2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ortega|first1=Francisco|title=The Cerebral Subject and the Challenge of Neurodiversity|journal=BioSocieties|date=December 2009|volume=4|issue=4|pages=425–445|doi=10.1017/S1745855209990287|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/biosoc/journal/v4/n4/full/biosoc200938a.html|language=en|issn=1745-8552}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts to a general recommendation by [[United States|US]] disability advocacy organizations{{who|date=July 2018}} for the use of [[person-first language]] when referring to a person with a medical or mental condition or disability, which emphasizes the ''person'' with the condition, who has, rather than is defined by it.&lt;ref&gt;[[BusinessWeek]] (letter to the editor), Issues 3059–3062, 1988 [https://books.google.com/books?id=tGA1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22people-first+language%22&amp;dq=%22people-first+language%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SaLOTKWwAYeBOoS1jOcB&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBA];

===Acceptance perspective===
Members of the various autism rights organizations view autism as a way of life rather than as a disease and thus advocate acceptance over a search for a cure.&lt;ref name=Harmon&gt;Harmon, Amy. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C07E0D9143CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63 Neurodiversity Forever; The Disability Movement Turns to Brains.] ''The New York Times'', May 9, 2004.  Retrieved on 2007-11-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Some advocates believe that common therapies for the behavioral and language differences associated with autism, like [[applied behavior analysis]], are not only misguided but also unethical.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michelle Dawson|Dawson, Michelle]].

The ''"acceptance perspective"'' endorsed by the movement is a view that [[autism spectrum|autism]] is not a disorder, but a normal occurrence—an alternate variation in brain wiring or a less common expression of the human genome.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt; Advocates of this perspective believe that autism is a unique way of being that should be validated, supported and appreciated rather than shunned, discriminated against or eliminated.&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gal&gt;{{cite news |author=Gal L |title=Who says autism's a disease? |work=Haaretz |date=2007-06-28 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html |accessdate=2007-07-16| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070701201936/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/876283.html| archivedate= 1 July 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe quirks and uniqueness of autistic individuals should be tolerated as the differences of any minority group should be tolerated and that efforts to eliminate autism should not be compared, for example, to curing cancer but instead to the antiquated notion of curing [[left-handedness]].&lt;ref name="Harmon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dawson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html|title=In Support of Michelle Dawson and Her Work|publisher=Autistics.org|accessdate=2012-03-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215181832/http://archive.autistics.org/library/dawson.html|archivedate=2012-02-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ARM is a part of the larger disability rights movement, and as such adheres to the social model of disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Waltz, M |title=Autism: A Social and Medical History |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |location=London |year=2013 |isbn=0-230-52750-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this model, struggles faced by autistic people are viewed as discrimination rather than deficiencies.

===Advocacy===
According to Andrew Fenton and Tim Krahn, proponents of neurodiversity strive to reconceptualize autism and related conditions in society by the following measures: acknowledging that neurodiversity does not require a cure; changing the language from the current "condition, disease, disorder, or illness"-based nomenclature and "broaden[ing] the understanding of healthy or independent living"; acknowledging new types of autonomy; and giving non-neurotypical individuals more control over their treatment, including the type, timing, and whether there should be treatment at all.&lt;ref name="article"&gt;Fenton, Andrew, and Tim Krahn.

A 2009 study&lt;ref name=Griffin&gt;{{cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Edward|author2=Pollak, David|title=Student experiences of neurodiversity in higher education: Insights from the BRAINHE project.|journal=Dyslexia|date=January 2009|volume=15|issue=1|pages=23–41|pmid=19140120|doi=10.1002/dys.383}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Edward Griffin and David Pollak separated 27 students (with autism, dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder, ADHD, and stroke), into two categories of self-view: "a 'difference' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a difference incorporating a set of strengths and weaknesses, or a 'medical/deficit' view—where neurodiversity was seen as a disadvantageous medical condition". They found that although all of the students reported uniformly difficult schooling careers involving exclusion, abuse, and bullying, those who viewed themselves from a difference view (41% of the study cohort) "indicated higher academic self-esteem and confidence in their abilities and many (73%) expressed considerable career ambitions with positive and clear goals".&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt; Many of these students reported gaining this view of themselves through contact with neurodiversity advocates in online support groups.&lt;ref name=Griffin/&gt;

A 2013 online survey said this: "Such a deficit-as-difference conception of autism suggests the importance of harnessing autistic traits in developmentally beneficial ways, transcending a false dichotomy between celebrating differences and ameliorating deficit".&lt;ref name="Kapp"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kapp|first=Steven K.|date=January 2013|title=Deficit, difference, or both?

In a ''[[New York Times]]'' piece on June 30, 1997, Blume did not use the term "neurodiversity", but he did describe the foundation of the idea in the phrase "neurological pluralism":&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E7DC1F31F933A05755C0A961958260|author=Blume, Harvey|title=Autistics, freed from face-to-face encounters, are communicating in cyberspace|work=The New York Times|date=June 30, 1997|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consensus emerging from the Internet forums and Web sites where autistics congregate [...] is that NT is only one of many neurological configurations -- the dominant one certainly, but not necessarily the best."&lt;ref name=BlumeNYT/&gt;}}

Blume was an early advocate who predicted the role the Internet would play in fostering the international neurodiversity movement, writing:&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT&gt;{{Cite web|author=Blume, Harvey|url=http://web.mit.edu/m-i-t/articles/index_blume.html|title="Autism &amp; The Internet" or "It's The Wiring, Stupid"|date=July 1, 1997|publisher=Media In Transition, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|There is a political dimension to this bond with the Internet.

The challenge we will all be increasingly confronted with, on-line and off, is, to look at ourselves differently than we have before, that is, to accept neurological diversity.&lt;ref name=BlumeMIT/&gt;}}

Some authors&lt;ref name=Solomon/&gt;&lt;ref name="article"/&gt; also credit the earlier work of autistic advocate [[Jim Sinclair (activist)|Jim Sinclair]], who was a principal early organizer of the international online autism community. Sinclair's 1993 speech, "Don't Mourn For Us",&lt;ref name=Sinclair&gt;Sinclair, Jim. [http://www.autreat.com/dont_mourn.html Don't Mourn For Us.] Autism Network International, n.d..  Retrieved on 2013-05-07.&lt;/ref&gt; mentioned that some parents considered their child's autism diagnosis as "the most traumatic thing that ever happened to them". Sinclair (who did not speak until the age of 12) addressed the communal grief parents felt by asking them to try to take the perspectives of autistic people themselves:
{{quote|Non-autistic people see autism as a great tragedy, and parents experience continuing disappointment and grief at all stages of the child's and family's life cycle. But this grief does not stem from the child's autism in itself. It is grief over the loss of the normal child the parents had hoped and expected to have ... There's no normal child hidden behind the autism. Autism is a way of being. It is pervasive; it colors every experience, every sensation, perception, thought, emotion, and encounter, every aspect of existence. It is not possible to separate the autism from the person—and if it were possible, the person you'd have left would not be the same person you started with. This is important, so take a moment to consider it: Autism is a way of being. It is not possible to separate the person from the autism.&lt;ref name=Sinclair/&gt;}}

The term "neurodiversity" has since been applied to other conditions and has taken on a more general meaning; for example, the [[Developmental Adult Neurodiversity Association]] (DANDA) in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] encompasses [[developmental coordination disorder]], [[attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[Asperger's syndrome]] and related conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danda.org.uk/ danda.org.uk]  DANDA website.  Retrieved on 6 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The concept of neurodiversity is controversial.&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt; Those supporting the [[medical model of disability]] identify the mental differences associated with these conditions as disorders, deficits, and dysfunctions, intrinsic differences in functioning which cause impairments in many areas of life. From this point of view, the mental states that are encompassed by neurodiversity are medical conditions that can and should be treated.&lt;ref name="Pollak"&gt;Pollak, David. 2009. "Neurodiversity in Higher Education." John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author David Pollak sees neurodiversity as an inclusive term for the equality of all possible mental states. Still others reject the word because they think it sounds too medical.&lt;ref name="Pollak" /&gt;

The concept of neurodiversity as applied to [[autism]] is criticized for being skewed towards the "high-functioning" individuals of the autistic spectrum or those with milder forms of the condition. Those with "low-functioning" autism are often significantly impaired in their everyday functioning, and may not be able to function effectively with even the extensive use of advanced [[Assistive technology|assistive technologies]]. Because many of these low-functioning individuals are unable to communicate effectively to express their opinions and wishes, controversy surrounds the issue of who represents them and what represents their interests.&lt;ref name="MichaelFitzpatrick"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fitzpatrick|first1=Michael|title=Why we should be cautious about celebrating autism|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/review_of_books/article/why-we-shouldnt-celebrate-autism/17468#.VxzY_nBWY7k|website=www.spiked-online.com|accessdate=24 April 2016|date=September 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sue Rubin]], an autistic woman and author who was the subject of the documentary ''[[Autism is a World]]'', favors a cure for the condition and asserts that while those with high-functioning autism tend to support the neurodiversity anti-cure position, those who have low-functioning autism generally hold the opposite opinion.&lt;ref name="Ortega2009" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rubin|first1=Sue|title=Acceptance versus cure|url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/autism.world/notebooks/sue/notebook.html|website=www-cgi.cnn.com|publisher=Cable News Network|accessdate=25 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926031713/http://www-cgi.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/autism.world/notebooks/sue/notebook.html|archive-date=26 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaarsma and Welin wrote in 2011 that the "broad version of the neurodiversity claim, covering low-functioning as well as high-functioning autism, is problematic. Only a narrow conception of neurodiversity, referring exclusively to high-functioning autists, is reasonable."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt; They say that "higher functioning" individuals with autism may "not [be] benefited with such a psychiatric defect-based diagnosis ... some of them are being harmed by it, because of the disrespect the diagnosis displays for their natural way of being", but "think that it is still reasonable to include other categories of autism in the psychiatric diagnostics. The narrow conception of the neurodiversity claim should be accepted but the broader claim should not."&lt;ref name=Jaarsma /&gt;

Criticism has been levied against the "acceptance" position of neurodiversity advocates, with it being noted that even though the biomedical therapies that target the clinical features of, for example, autism and the conditions that may co-occur with it, do not amount to a complete cure, such treatments can still potentially significantly improve the everyday functioning and quality of life of those with these conditions. While such treatments require substantial investment and development and would not be available for application in the immediate future, they may provide greater benefit in the future and in the long-term.&lt;ref name="MichaelFitzpatrick" /&gt; Many of those who view autism as a disabling developmental disease consider that the acceptance perspective of neurodiversity insults the suffering of its patients and their families.&lt;ref name="Ortega2009" /&gt;  Biology professor [[Jerry Coyne]] says that in its extreme, neurodiversity wishes to deny medical treatment for any person with a mental condition, particularly autism, even if the person wants a medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Coyne"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coyne |first1=Jerry |title=What do we do about “neurodiversity”? |url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2015/06/23/what-do-we-do-about-neurodiversity/ |website=Why Evolution Is True |accessdate=1 October 2018 |date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Mitchell (writer)|Jonathan Mitchell]], an [[autistic]] author and blogger who is a vocal opponent of the neurodiversity movement and an advocate for research for a cure for autism, criticizes the concept of neurodiversity for providing "simplistic solutions to hard problems" and trivializing the disabling aspects of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White|first1=Mark|title=A different way of thinking|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/feature/different-way-thinking|website=News|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He considers his condition to have negatively affected his life, describing autism as having "prevented me from making a living or ever having a girlfriend. It's given me bad fine motor coordination problems where I can hardly write. I have an impaired ability to relate to people. I can't concentrate or get things done."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Jon|title=Shortage of Brain Tissue Hinders Autism Research|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2013/02/04/170835708/shortage-of-brain-tissue-sets-autism-research-back|website=NPR|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes neurodiversity as a "tempting escape valve" for many of the people who are on the autism spectrum; and commenting on the supposition of a general acceptance of neurodiversity by those on the spectrum, he says that "most persons with an autism-spectrum disorder have never expressed their opinions on someone's blog and never will".

{{Other uses|Ornament (disambiguation){{!}}Ornament}}
In [[architecture]] and [[decorative art]], '''ornament''' is a decoration used to [[embellish]] parts of a building or object.  Large figurative elements such as [[monumental sculpture]] and their equivalents in decorative art are excluded from the term; most ornament does not include human figures, and if present they are small compared to the overall scale. Architectural ornament can be carved from stone, wood or precious metals, formed with plaster or clay, or painted or impressed onto a surface as '''applied ornament'''; in other [[applied arts]] the main material of the object, or a different one such as paint or [[vitreous enamel]] may be used.  

A wide variety of decorative styles and [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] have been developed for architecture and the applied arts, including [[pottery]], [[furniture]], [[metalwork]]. In [[textiles]], [[wallpaper]] and other objects where the decoration may be the main justification for its existence, the terms pattern or design are more likely to be used.  The vast range of motifs used in ornament draw from geometrical shapes and patterns, plants, and human and animal figures.  Across [[Eurasia]] and the [[Mediterranean]] world there has been a rich and linked tradition of plant-based ornament for over three thousand years; traditional ornament from other parts of the world typically relies more on geometrical and animal motifs.  

In a 1941 essay,&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, John (1941) printed in ''Heavenly Mansions'' 1963, p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; the architectural historian Sir [[John Summerson]] called it "surface modulation". The earliest decoration and ornament often survives from prehistoric cultures in simple markings on pottery, where decoration in other materials (including [[tattoo]]s) has been lost. Where the [[potter's wheel]] was used, the technology made some kinds of decoration very easy; [[weaving]] is another technology which also lends itself very easily to decoration or pattern, and to some extent dictates its form. Ornament has been evident in [[civilization]]s since the beginning of [[recorded history]], ranging from [[Ancient Egyptian architecture]] to the assertive lack of ornament of 20th century [[Modernism|Modernist architecture]].

Ornament implies that the ornamented object has a function that an unornamented equivalent might also fulfill.  Where the object has no such function, but exists only to be a [[work of art]] such as a [[sculpture]] or painting, the term is less likely to be used, except for peripheral elements. In recent centuries a distinction between the [[fine arts]] and applied or [[decorative arts]] has been applied (except for architecture), with ornament mainly seen as a feature of the latter class.

==History==

The history of art in many cultures shows a series of wave-like trends where the level of ornament used increases over a period, before a sharp reaction returns to plainer forms, after which ornamentation gradually increases again. The pattern is especially clear in post-Roman European art, where the highly ornamented [[Insular art]] of the [[Book of Kells]] and other manuscripts influenced continental Europe, but the classically inspired [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] and [[Ottonian art]] largely replaced it. Ornament increased over the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art|Gothic]] periods, but was greatly reduced in [[Renaissance art|Early Renaissance]] styles, again under classical influence. Another period of increase, in [[Northern Mannerism]], the [[Baroque]] and [[Rococo]], was checked by [[Neoclassicism]] and the [[Romantic period]], before resuming in the later 19th century [[Victorian decorative arts]] and their continental equivalents, to be decisively reduced by the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and then [[Modernism]]. 
  
The detailed study of Eurasian ornamental forms was begun by [[Alois Riegl]] in his [[formalism (art)|formalist]] study ''[[Stilfragen]]: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik'' (''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'') of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the ''Kunstwollen''.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from [[Ancient Egyptian art]] and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesque]] of [[Islamic art]].  While the concept of the ''Kunstwollen'' has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider ''corpus'' of examples known today.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24-25; see also [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-8220-Style-8221-151-or-whatever-4745 "“Style”—or whatever", J. Duncan Berry], A review of ''Problems of Style'' by Alois Riegl, ''[[The New Criterion]]'', April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rawson]] has recently extended the analysis to cover [[Chinese art]], which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the [[Mongol invasion of Persia|Mongol invasion]] harmonious and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, the subject of her book, see Preface, and Chapter 5 on Chinese influences on Persian art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Styles of ornamentation can be studied in reference to the specific [[Cultural heritage|culture]] which developed unique forms of decoration, or modified ornament from other cultures. The [[Ancient Egypt]]ian culture is arguably the first civilization to add pure decoration to their buildings. Their ornament takes the forms of the natural world in that climate, decorating the capitals of columns and walls with images of papyrus and palm trees. [[Assyria]]n culture produced ornament which shows influence from Egyptian sources and a number of original themes, including figures of plants and animals of the region.

[[Ancient Greek]] civilization created many new forms of ornament, with regional variations from [[Doric order|Doric]], [[Ionic order|Ionic]], and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] groups.  The [[Ancient Roman|Romans]] [[romanization (cultural)|Latinized]] the pure forms of the Greek ornament and adapted the forms to every purpose.

==Ornament prints and pattern books==

[[File:FroissartOurs.jpg|thumb|A detail from the margin of a page of [[Froissart of Louis of Gruuthuse (BnF Fr 2643-6)|a Late Gothic manuscript]]]]
A few medieval notebooks survive, most famously that of [[Villard de Honnecourt]] (13th century) showing how artists and craftsmen recorded designs they saw for future use. With the arrival of the [[old master print|print]] [[ornament print]]s became an important part of the output of printmakers, especially in Germany, and played a vital role in the rapid diffusion of new Renaissance styles to makers of all sorts of object. As well as revived classical ornament, both architectural and the [[grotesque]] style derived from Roman interior decoration, these included new styles such as the [[moresque]], a European adaptation of the Islamic arabesque (a distinction not always clear at the time). 

As printing became cheaper, the single ornament print turned into sets, and then finally books.  From the 16th to the 19th century, [[pattern book]]s were published in Europe which gave access to decorative elements, eventually including those recorded from cultures all over the world. Andrea Palladio's [[I quattro libri dell'architettura]] (Four Books on Architecture) (Venice, 1570),&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]],[http://www.palladiancenter.org/palladiobooks.html "Palladio and his Books."]&lt;/ref&gt; which included both drawings of classical Roman buildings and renderings of Palladio's own designs utilizing those motifs, became the most influential book ever written on architecture. Napoleon had the great pyramids and temples of Egypt documented in the ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)]]''. [[Owen Jones (architect)|Owen Jones]] published ''[[The Grammar of Ornament]]'' in 1856 with colored illustrations of decoration from Egypt, Turkey, Sicily and Spain. He took residence in the [[Alhambra|Alhambra Palace]] to make drawings and plaster castings of the ornate details of the [[Islamic art|Islamic ornaments]] there, including [[arabesque]]s, [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]], and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. Interest in [[classical architecture]] was also fueled by the tradition of traveling on [[Grand Tour|The Grand Tour]], and by translation of early literature about architecture in the work of [[Vitruvius]] and [[Michelangelo]].

During the 19th century, the acceptable use of ornament, and its precise definition became the source of aesthetic controversy in academic Western architecture, as architects and their critics searched for a suitable style. "The great question is," [[Thomas Leverton Donaldson]] asked in 1847, "are we to have an architecture of our period, a distinct, individual, palpable style of the 19th century?".&lt;ref&gt;quoted by Summerson&lt;/ref&gt; In 1849, when [[Matthew Digby Wyatt]] viewed the [[French Industrial Exposition of 1844|French Industrial Exposition]] set up on the [[Champs-Elysées]] in Paris, he disapproved in recognizably modern terms of the plaster ornaments in faux-bronze and faux woodgrain:&lt;ref&gt;[http://charon.sfsu.edu/publications/ParisExpositions/SecondRepublicExpo.html Second Republic Exposition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212102110/http://charon.sfsu.edu/publications/ParisExpositions/SecondRepublicExpo.html |date=2006-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Both internally and externally there is a good deal of tasteless and unprofitable ornament... If each simple material had been allowed to tell its own tale, and the lines of the construction so arranged as to conduce to a sentiment of grandeur, the qualities of "power" and "truth," which its enormous extent must have necessarily ensured, could have scarcely fail to excite admiration, and that at a very considerable saving of expense. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Contacts with other cultures through [[colonialism]] and the new discoveries of [[archaeology]] expanded the repertory of ornament available to revivalists. After about 1880, photography made details of ornament even more widely available than prints had done.

==Modern ornament==
Modern [[Millwork (building material)|millwork]] ornaments are made of wood, plastics, composites, etc. They come in many different colours and shapes.
[[Modern architecture]], conceived of as the elimination of ornament in favor of purely functional structures, left architects the problem of how to properly adorn modern structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sankovitch | first=Anne-Marie | title=Structure/ornament and the modern figuration of architecture | url= http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54073966.html | date= 12/1/1998 | publisher= The Art Bulletin| accessdate=2007-11-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107140938/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-54073966.html |archivedate = November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were two available routes from this perceived crisis. One was to attempt to devise an ornamental vocabulary that was new and essentially contemporary. This was the route taken by architects like [[Louis Sullivan]] and his pupil [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], or by the unique [[Antoni Gaudí]]. [[Art Nouveau]], for all its excesses, was a conscious effort to evolve such a "natural" vocabulary of ornament.

A more radical route abandoned the use of ornament altogether, as in some designs for objects by [[Christopher Dresser]]. At the time, such unornamented objects could have been found in many unpretending workaday items of industrial design, ceramics produced at the Arabia manufactory in Finland, for instance, or the glass insulators of electric lines.

This latter approach was described by architect [[Adolf Loos]] in his 1908 manifesto, translated into English in 1913 and polemically titled ''[[Ornament and Crime]]'', in which he declared that lack of decoration is the sign of an advanced society.  His argument was that ornament is economically inefficient and "morally degenerate", and that reducing ornament was a sign of progress. Modernists were eager to point to American architect [[Louis Sullivan]] as their godfather in the cause of aesthetic simplification, dismissing the knots of intricately patterned ornament that articulated the skin of his structures.

With the work of [[Le Corbusier]] and the [[Bauhaus]] through the 1920s and 1930s, lack of decorative detail became a hallmark of [[modern architecture]] and equated with the moral virtues of honesty, simplicity, and purity.  In 1932 [[Philip Johnson]] and [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] dubbed this the "[[International style (architecture)|International Style]]".  What began as a matter of taste was transformed into an aesthetic mandate.  Modernists declared their way as the only acceptable way to build.  As the style hit its stride in the highly developed postwar work of [[Mies van der Rohe]], the tenets of 1950s modernism became so strict that even accomplished architects like [[Edward Durrell Stone]] and [[Eero Saarinen]] could be ridiculed and effectively ostracized for departing from the aesthetic rules.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

At the same time, the unwritten laws against ornament began to come into serious question.  "Architecture has, with some difficulty, liberated itself from ornament, but it has not liberated itself from the ''fear'' of ornament," [[John Summerson]] observed in 1941. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paulshepheard.com/words/slogans-and-battlecries/|title=Slogans and Battlecries {{!}} Paul Shepheard {{!}} Architect {{!}} Writer|website=www.paulshepheard.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The very difference between ornament and structure is subtle and perhaps arbitrary.  The pointed arches and flying buttresses of [[Gothic architecture]] are ornamental but structurally necessary; the colorful rhythmic bands of a [[Pietro Belluschi]] International Style skyscraper are integral, not applied, but certainly have ornamental effect. Furthermore, architectural ornament can serve the practical purpose of establishing scale, signaling entries, and aiding wayfinding, and these useful design tactics had been outlawed.  And by the mid-1950s, modernist figureheads [[Le Corbusier]] and [[Marcel Breuer]] had been breaking their own rules by producing highly expressive, sculptural concrete work.

The argument against ornament peaked in 1959 over discussions of the [[Seagram Building]], where [[Mies van der Rohe]] installed a series of structurally unnecessary vertical I-beams on the outside of the building, and by 1984, when [[Philip Johnson]] produced his AT&amp;T Building in Manhattan with an ornamental pink granite neo-Georgian pediment, the argument was effectively over.  In retrospect, critics have seen the [[Sony Building (New York)|AT&amp;T Building]] as the first [[Postmodernist]] building. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In the [[philosophy of science]], the '''pessimistic induction''', also known as the '''pessimistic meta-induction''', is an argument which seeks to rebut [[scientific realism]], particularly the scientific realist's notion of [[#Overview|epistemic optimism]].

==Overview&lt;!--'Epistemic optimism' redirects here--&gt;==
Scientific realists argue that we have good reasons to believe that our presently successful scientific theories are true or approximately true. The pessimistic meta-induction undermines the realist's warrant for their '''epistemic optimism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the view that science tends to succeed in revealing what the world is like and that there are good reasons to take theories to be true or truthlike) via historical counterexample. Using meta-[[inductive reasoning|induction]], [[Larry Laudan]] argues that if past scientific theories which were successful were found to be false, we have no reason to believe the realist's claim that our currently successful theories are approximately true. The pessimistic meta-induction argument was first fully postulated by Laudan in 1981.

However, there are some objections against Laudan's theory. One might see shortcomings in the historic examples Laudan gives as proof of his hypothesis. Theories later refuted, like that of [[celestial spheres|crystalline spheres]] in astronomy, or the [[phlogiston theory]], do not represent the most successful theories at their time. A further objection tries to point out that in scientific progress we indeed approximate the truth. When we develop a new theory, the central ideas of the old one usually become refuted. Parts of the old theory, however, we carry over to the new one. In doing so, our theories become more and more well-founded on other principles, they become better in terms of predictive and descriptive power, so that, for example, aeroplanes, computers and DNA sequencing all establish technical, operational proof of the effectiveness of the theories. Therefore, we can hold the realist view that our theoretical terms refer to something in the world and our theories are approximately true.

However, as articulated by Thomas S. Kuhn in his ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', new scientific theories do not always build upon the older ones. In fact, they are created by an entirely new set of premises (a new "paradigm"), and reach vastly different conclusions. This gives greater weight to the proponents of anti-realism, and illustrates that no scientific theory (thus far) has proved infallible.

'''Political criticism''' (also referred to as '''political commentary''' or '''political discussion''') is [[criticism]] that is specific of or relevant to [[politics]], including [[policies]], [[politicians]], [[political parties]], and types of [[government]].

==Controversy==
There has been controversy over the relevance and importance of political criticism in civilizations, particularly [[democratic societies]].

Advocates argue that political discussion creates and promotes the variety of opinions necessary for a true democracy. The [[American constitution]] is often pointed to as support for the belief, ensuring for all peoples under its administration such maxims as [[free speech]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Critics of this philosophy argue that the general public (and, on a more individual  basis, the "Average Joe") lacks the resources and capability to conceive opinions that are educated enough to be taken seriously. Thus, the abundance and fervent promotion of such opinions merely confuses and complicates political matters that, given an appropriate amount of factual education, are either easily understood or should be discussed only by those with sufficient [[intelligence]] to do the matter justice.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Methods==
There are many methods used throughout [[written history|history]] of promoting political opinions and with the development of new  [[technologies]] new ways have materialized both in recent and ancient history. Some of the most common include the following:

===Books===
[[Image:Gutenberg Bible.jpg|thumbnail|250px|left|[[The Bible]], one of the most influential books of all time]]
Throughout history one of the most influential methods (arguably '''the''' most influential method) of promoting political opinions has been literary. This peculiar pattern of books influencing the thinking of the masses, reinstated with such books as [[the Bible]], [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]], the [[Qur'an]], ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and many others, has been attributed to many of the characteristics of [[writing]]. While it has been proven that a well-written book can indeed appeal to one's intellect with reasoning and ideas sprung from [[common sense]], the drive of [[literature]] and writing is most commonly considered to be derivative of the [[emotions|emotional impact]] of the text, guiding people to think a certain way by making them feel a certain way. This often has great political consequences, most particularly when the subject of the emotional reaction is a plea for moral justice, as can be seen (to use America as an example once more) in the aftermath of the publication of [[Uncle Tom's Cabin]] concerning American views about [[slavery]]. It is from this correlation between books and politics that the phrase, "[[the pen is mightier than the sword]]", derives.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Television and films===
Since their development in this past century, both [[television]] and [[films]] have often had far-reaching political effects throughout the world. Influential films and television events include [[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]], [[Citizen Kane]], the works of [[Walt Disney]], and such political [[satire]] as that found in [[The Simpsons]]. Like literature (see above), a movie or television event has the capacity to have emotional impact on its viewers, making it an invaluable tool for politics. This attribute is noticed and used frequently by politicians and ordinary citizens alike; political [[propaganda]] on the screen now has an effect on everything from a nation's outlook on its economy to the smallest of elections and political decisions.

===Political cartoons===
{{Main|Political satire}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:conscripcartoon.jpg|thumb|150px|Editorial cartoon concerning [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]]'s freedom from his [[Conscription Crisis of 1944|Conscription promise]] by [[Johnny Canuck]].]] --&gt;
[[Political cartoons]] (also known as "editorial cartoons") are infamous for their ability to promote political views through satirical means. With cartoons the fight for the minds of the public is not a [[:wikt:verbal|verbal]] but a [[visual]] one and leaving strong impressions with the use of powerful  [[symbols]] or [[metaphors]] in order to communicate the artist's messages.

===News===
Since many people know only a very little about their civilization and its present state except for what is told to them by [[news media|the media]], the potential for influence is extremely high with the publication of [[newspapers]], news broadcasts, etc. Any bias in these mediums alters people's impressions of current events into different understandings and opinions than those that may have been chosen with more accurate information.

===Internet===
With the recent invention of the [[Internet]], political criticism has been greatly extended to anyone with a connection to the [[World Wide Web]]. In a few decades already this has revolutionized politics to the extent that the public now has a virtually unlimited education quite literally at its fingertips, allowing people to choose with less work what aspects of current politics they wish to research.

The many means of exchanging ideas, including [[blogs]] and [[internet forum]]s, has extended the political debate to anyone that cares to contribute.  This ability and speed that which ideas can flow has literally changed the way that [[political parties]] stay connected to [[Electoral district|constituents]].

'''Product analysis''' involves examining product features, costs, availability, quality and other aspects. Product analysis is conducted by potential buyers, by product managers attempting to understand competitors and by third party reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-materials.eng.cam.ac.uk/mpsite/tutorial/non_IE/prodanal.html|title=Product Analysis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologystudent.com/prddes1/prdanl1.html|title=Product Analysis|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product analysis can also be used as part of product design to convert a high-level product description into project deliverables and requirements. It involves all facets of the product, its purpose, its operation, and its characteristics.

== Techniques ==
Related techniques include product breakdown, systems analysis, systems engineering, value engineering, value analysis and functional analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://lmit.edu.au/blog/diploma-project-management-define-product-analysis/|title=Diploma in Project Management - How to Define a Product Analysis|website=lmit.edu.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Product breakdown: Recursively divide the product into components and subcomponents.
* Systems engineering: Ensure that the product satisfies customer needs, cost requirements, and quality demands.
* Value engineering: Consider alternative designs and construction techniques to reduce cost/increase profit.
* Value analysis: Assess the cost/quality ratio to ensure that the product is cost effective.
* Function analysis: Ensure that the product has features appropriate to customer requirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2343">'''Regenerative economics''' is an [[economic system]] that works to regenerate [[capital assets]]. A capital asset is an asset that provides goods and/or services that are required for, or contribute to, our [[well being]]. In standard [[economic theory]], one can either “regenerate” one's capital assets or consume them until the point where the asset cannot produce a viable stream of goods and/or services. What sets regenerative economics apart from standard economic theory is that it takes into account and gives hard economic value to the principal or original capital assets — the [[earth]] and the [[sun]]. We cannot do much to affect the sun although we can value access to the sun in such areas where access can be influenced. Therefore, most of Regenerative Economics focuses on the earth and the [[goods and services]] it supplies.

Regenerative economics is completely comfortable within the capitalist economic framework. Recognizing the earth as the original capital asset places the true value on the human support system known as the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]. Not having this original value properly recognized has created the unsustainable economic condition referred to as [[uneconomic growth]], a phrase coined by leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]], as stated in the book Reshaping the [[Built Environment]].&lt;ref&gt;Reshaping the Built Environment, edited by Charles J. Kibert, Forward by Alex Wilson, Written by Herman E. Daly Copyright 1999, Island Press {{ISBN|1-55963-701-3}}, {{ISBN|1-55963-702-1}}, Chapter 5 Uneconomic Growth and the Built Environment, In Theory and in Fact. pages 73–88&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the regenerative economic theory believe that uneconomic growth is the opposite of regenerative economics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4362">The '''Swedish Institute in Rome''' ({{lang-sv|Svenska Institutet i Rom}}, {{lang-it|Istituto Svedese di studi classici a Roma}}) is a research institution that serves as the base for archaeological excavations and other scientific research in [[Italy]]. It also pursues academic instruction in [[archaeology]] and art sciences as well as arranging conferences with themes of interest to the institute. The Institute has at its disposal a building in central [[Rome]] with a relatively well-supplied library, archaeological laboratory and around twenty rooms and smaller apartments for the use of visiting researchers and holders of scholarships.

The institute was founded in 1925 by, among others, King [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Gustaf VI Adolf]], then Crown Prince of [[Sweden]].

==Excavations==
The Institute has conducted several major excavations. Before [[World War II]], excavations were carried out on the [[Forum Romanum]] among other places, but since then most of them have taken place in southern [[Etruria]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isvroma.it/public/NEW/English/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=55 Istituto Svedese di studi classici a Roma - History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309011435/http://www.isvroma.it/public/New/English/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=49&amp;Itemid=55 |date=2017-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TVET (Technical and Vocational Education and Training)''' is education and training which provides knowledge and skills for employment.&lt;ref name=UNESCO-UNEVOC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|date=28 August 2017|website=UNESCO-UNEVOC|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET uses [[Formal learning|formal]], [[Nonformal learning|non-formal]] and [[informal learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/themes/skills-work-and-life|title=Skills for work and life|last=|first=|date=|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO|archiveurl=|archivedate=|dead-url=|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; TVET is recognised to be a crucial vehicle for [[social equity]], inclusion and sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M.|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|pages=9-10, 41, 43, 47-48, 56-58, 63, 80, 95, 98-103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development of the term TVET ==
The term 'Technical and Vocational Education and Training' or TVET was officiated at the World Congress on TVET in 1999 in [[Seoul|Seoul, Republic of Korea]]. The congress recognised the term TVET to be broad enough to incorporate other terms that had been used to describe similar educational and training activities including Workforce Education (WE), and Technical-Vocational Education (TVE). The term TVET parallels other types of education and training e.g [[Vocational education|Vocational Education]] but is also used as an umbrella term to encompass education and training activities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/go.php?q=What+is+TVET|title=What is TVET?|last=UNESCO-UNEVOC|first=|date=|website=www.unevoc.unesco.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision in 1999 to officiate the term TVET led to the development of the [[UNESCO-UNEVOC]] International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training in [[Bonn, Germany]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Hybridisation ==
Because of TVET′s isolation with other education streams it was not widely adopted, in particularly in secondary education. Steps were taken to reduce segmentation of education and training and to address institutional barriers that restricted TVET learners′ options including choices to move vertically to higher levels of learning, or horizontally to other streams.

Policy-makers have introduced forms of hybridization with other education systems, additionally some of the distinctions between TVET and ′academic′ education streams have been blurred.&lt;ref&gt;Maclean, R. and Pavlova, M. 2011. Vocationalisation of secondary and higher education: pathways to the world of work. UNESCO-UNEVOC, ''Revisiting Global Trends in TVET: Reflections on Theory and Practice''. Bonn, Germany, UNESCO-UNEVOC International Centre for Technical and Vocational Education and Training, pp. 40–85.&lt;/ref&gt; This hybridisation has been termed the ′vocationalization of secondary education′, a similar process has happened to a lesser extent in tertiary education.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== France and the Netherlands ===
The [[Baccalauréat|baccalauréat professionnel]] in [[France]], and the [[Education in the Netherlands|middelbaar beroepsonderwijs]] (MBO) ount of work experience in the area they are specializing in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Germany and Austria ===
Apprenticeships enhanced content within occupational training courses and considerable emphasis has been placed on personal skills.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== India ===
Work education has been included in the primary standards (grades 1–8) to make the students aware of work. At the lower secondary level (grades 9–10) pre-vocational education has been included with the aim to increase students’ familiarity with the world of work.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Republic of Korea ===
Around 40% of secondary students are currently enrolled in TVET education, in some schools, academic and vocational students share almost 75% of the curriculum.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Russian Federation ===
A new approach to vocationalization of secondary schooling has been introduced within the framework of general educational reform. This has been guided by the Ministry of Education’s strategy of modernization. Vocationalization in the Russian Federation refers to the introduction of profile education at the upper-secondary level (the last two years of schooling, grades 10 and 11) and the process of preparation for profile selection. Profile education provided students with the opportunity to study a chosen area in depth, usually one that would be related to their further study (TVET or academic). Schools could design their own profiles, e.g science, socio-economics, humanities, and technology, or keep a general orientation curriculum. In preparation for the upper-secondary specialization, a ′pre-profiling′ programme in grade 9 has been introduced to help students make their choices in grade 10.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== United States of America ===
Tech-prep programmes in the [[United States|United States of America]] are examples of how the ′blending′ approach was used to help students make the connections between school and work. In year nine, programmes in broad occupational fields such as the health professions, [[Automotive tecnology|automotive technology]], computer systems networking are offered within general technology studies. The programmes continue for at least two years after the end of secondary school, through a tertiary education or an apprenticeship programme, with students achieving an associate degree or certificate by the end of the programme.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Private sector ==
Private TVET providers include [[for-profit]] and [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] institutions. Several factors triggered actions to support the expansion of private TVET including the limited capacities of public TVET providers and their low responsiveness to enterprises and trainees. Private TVET providers were expected to be more responsive because they were subject to fewer bureaucratic restrictions than public institutions (particularly in centralized systems). Their presence was expected to help raise quality system-wide, in many developing countries, government budgets constituted a vulnerable and unreliable source of financing for TVET, an important objective was to finance TVET systems by increasing the contribution of beneficiaries, including employers and trainees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Private TVET provision over since 2005 has become a significant and growing part of TVET in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Johanson, R. K. and Adams, A. V. 2004. ''Skills Development in Sub-Saharan Africa''. Washington, DC, World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;ETF and World Bank. 2005. ''Reforming Technical Vocational Education and Training in the Middle East and North Africa: Experiences and Challenges''. Luxembourg, Office for Official Publications of the European Communities.&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, e.g [[Lebanon]], enrolments in private TVET institutions have exceeded enrolments in public institutions. In [[Jordan]], private provision at the community college level has been promoted by the government.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However not all experiences has been positive with private proprietary institutions or [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], their courses have often been concentrated in professional areas that typically do not require large capital investment, permitting easy entry and exit by private providers from the sector. Quality issues have also emerged, where market information about quality has been unavailable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Technological advancement and its impact==
TVET has an important role to play in technology diffusion through transfer of knowledge and skills. Rapid technological progress has had and continues to have significant implications for TVET. Understanding and anticipating changes has become crucial for designing responsive TVET systems and, more broadly, effective skills policies. The flexibility to adapt the supply of skills to the rapidly, and in some cases radically, changing needs in sectors such as [[information technology]] and the [[green economy]] has become a central feature of TVET systems. Globally, the skills requirements and qualifications demanded for job entry are rising. This reflects a need for not just a more knowledgeable and skilled workforce, but one that can adapt quickly to new emerging technologies in a cycle of continuous learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TVET courses have been created to respond to the diverse [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] needs of learners, whether these are related to work, education or citizenship. New courses have been introduced to address occupational changes in the ICT job market, while many TVET providers have shifted provision towards a blended approach, with significantly more self-directed and/or [[Distance education|distance learning]]. In developed countries, new ICT approaches have been introduced to modernize TVET organizations and to manage administration and finance, including learner records.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Education for all ==
{{main|Education For All}}

The Education for All (EFA) movement has had its own implications for TVET at both international and national levels. The third EFA goal lacked precision and measurable targets for TVET, however it called for ensuring ′that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programmes′.&lt;ref&gt;World Conference on Education for All. 2000. ''The Dakar Framework for Action: Meeting our Collective Commitments to Education for All''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt; This goal had a symbolic value, helping to raise the visibility of TVET and skills development and create a more prominent place for them on the global education policy agenda. The current bulge of young people requiring TVET learning opportunities is partly fuelled by the success of the EFA movement in opening access to [[basic education]], particularly at the primary level. In 2009, 702 million children were enrolled worldwide in primary education, compared with 646 million in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2006. ''Participation in Formal Technical and Vocational Education and Training Programmes Worldwide: An Initial Statistical Study''. Bonn. UNESCO-UNEVOC.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Continuing TVET ==
Continuing TVET involves ongoing training to upgrade existing skills and to develop new ones and has a much higher profile in ageing societies and knowledge-based economies. Increased recognition of the importance of human capital for economic growth and social development made it necessary to increase learning opportunities for adults in workplaces within the wider context of policies and strategies for lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2005.

In many countries policy-makers have considered ways to expand workplace learning opportunities for workers and to assess and give credit for knowledge and skills acquired in workplaces. Efforts were geared towards training for workers in companies, encouraged by legislation, financial incentives and contractual agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Challenges ==
=== Labour market demands and trends ===
Following the [[Global financial crisis in 2009|global financial crisis in 2008]], labour markets across the world experienced structural changes that influenced the demand for skills and TVET. [[Unemployment]] worsened and the quality of jobs decreased, especially for [[youth]]. Gender differentials in labour force participation placed men ahead of women, and skill mismatches deepened. The crisis impacted labour markets adversely and led to deepening uncertainty, vulnerability of employment, and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;Bacchetta, M. and Jansen, M. (eds). 2011. ''Making Globalisation Socially Sustainable''. Geneva, ILO and WTO.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, measures to improve efficiency and profitability in the economic recovery have often led to [[jobless recovery|jobless growth]], as happened in [[Algeria]], [[India]] and [[post-apartheid South Africa]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In seeking to address the level of vulnerable employment, TVET systems have focused on increasing the employability of graduates and enhancing their capacity to function effectively within existing vulnerable labour markets and to adjust to other labour market constraints. This has meant enhanced coordination among government departments responsible for TVET and employment policies. It has also created the need for TVET systems to develop mechanisms that identify skills needs early on and make better use of labour market information for matching skills demands and supply. TVET systems have focused more on developing immediate job skills and wider competencies. This has been accomplished by adopting competency-based approaches to instruction and workplace learning that enable learners to handle vulnerable employment, adjust to changing jobs and career contexts, and build their capacity to learn and agility to adapt.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Migration flows ===
Increasing migration are significant challenges to the national character of TVET systems and qualifications. TVET qualifications are progressively expected not only to serve as proxies for an individual's competencies but to also act as a form of a currency that signals national and international value.&lt;ref&gt;Leney, T. 2009a. ''Qualifications that Count: Strengthening the Recognition of Qualifications in the Mediterranean Region''. Thematic Study. Turin, Italy, ETF. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.etf.europa.eu/web&lt;/nowiki&gt;. nsf/(RSS)/C125782B0048D6F6C125768200396FB6?OpenDocument&amp;LAN=EN&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; TVET systems have been developing mechanisms to enable credible and fair cross-border recognition of skills. In 2007, the [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] identified three types of recognition that TVET system may use: unilateral (independent assessment by the receiving country), mutual (agreements between sending and receiving countries), and multilateral (mostly between a regional grouping of countries). The most prevalent of these is unilateral recognition, which is mostly under the control of national credential evaluation agencies. Countries have been slow to move from input-based skill evaluations to outcome-based methodologies that focus on competencies attained.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Keevy, J. 2011. ''The recognition of qualifications across borders: the contribution of regional qualifications frameworks''. Background paper commissioned by UNESCO. Pretoria, South African Qualifications Authority.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

TVET systems are responding to migration by providing qualifications that can stand the rigour of these recognition systems and by creating frameworks for mutual recognition of qualifications. Regional Qualifications Frameworks such as those in [[Southern Africa]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]] and the [[Caribbean]] aim to significantly support the recognition of qualifications across borders.&lt;ref&gt;Keevy, J., Chakroun, B. and Deij, A. 2010. ''Transnational Qualifications Frameworks''. Luxembourg, Publications Office of the European Union.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts are further supported through the introduction of outcome-based learning methodologies within the broader context of multilateral recognition agreements.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Providing broader competencies alongside specialist skills===
Skills for economic development include a mix of technical and [[soft skills]]. Empirical evidence and TVET policy reviews conducted by [[UNESCO]] suggest that TVET systems may not as yet sufficiently support the development of the so-called soft competencies.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013b. ''Policy Review of TVET in Cambodia''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0022/002253/225360e.pdf#xml=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?database=&amp;set=53761B39_2_350&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013c. ''Policy Review of TVET in Lao PDR''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/&lt;/nowiki&gt; images/0022/002211/221146e.pdf#xml=&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?datab&lt;/nowiki&gt; ase=&amp;set=53761918_0_231&amp;hits_rec=2&amp;hits_lng=eng&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2013d. ''Revue de politiques de formation technique et professionnelle au Benin''. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002213/221304f.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Many countries have, however, adopted competency-based approaches as measures for reforming TVET curricula.

The [[HEART Trust National Training Agency]] of [[Jamaica]] adopted this approach, with a particular emphasis on competency standards and balanced job-specific and generic skills. Competency standards aimed to ensure that the training was linked to industry and was up to date, and that competences were integrated into training programmes, along with the needed knowledge, skills and attitudes. The balancing of skill types was to ensure adequate attention was given to job-specific skills as well as the conceptual and experiential knowledge necessary to enable individuals to grow and develop in the workplace, and more generally in society.&lt;ref&gt;HEART Trust NTA. 2009. ''Policy on competency-based education and training''. Draft Concept Paper. Kingston, HEART Trust NTA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Globalization ===
Globalization of the economy and the consequent reorganization of the workplace require a more adaptable labour force, requiring countries to rethink the nature and role of TVET. Globalization intensifies pressure on the TVET sector to supply the necessary skills to workers involved in globalized activity and to adapt existing skills to rapidly changing needs. As a consequence, there is an increasing requirement for more demand-driven TVET systems with a greater focus on modular and competency-based programmes, as well as on cognitive and transferable skills, which are expected to help people adapt to unpredictable conditions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Promoting social equity and inclusive workplaces ===
Preparing marginalized groups of youths and adults with the right skills and helping them make the transition from school to work is part of the problem faced by TVET in promoting social equity. Ensuring that the workplace is inclusive poses numerous policy challenges, depending on the contextual dynamics of inclusion and exclusion, and the capabilities of individuals. For example, the experiences of exclusion by people with [[Disability|disabilities]] and disadvantaged women may be similar in some ways and different in others. Many individuals experience multiple forms of disadvantage in the workplace, to different degrees of severity, depending on social attitudes and traditions in a specific context or organization. Approaches to inclusiveness in the workplace will therefore vary according to population needs, social diversity and context. To give one example, the Netherlands set about the task of making workplaces more inclusive for low-skilled adults by offering programmes that combine language instruction with work, and in certain cases on-the-job training.&lt;ref&gt;OECD. 2012. ''Better Skills Better Jobs Better Lives – OECD: A Strategic Approach to Skills Policies''. Paris, OECD Publishing. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/better-skills-better-jobs-&lt;/nowiki&gt; better-lives_9789264177338-en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A review of employer surveys in [[Australia]], the [[Netherlands]], the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States|United States of America]], reported that employers valued people with disabilities for their high levels of motivation and their diverse perspectives, and found their attendance records to be the same or better than those of other employees.&lt;ref&gt;Employers’ Forum on Disability. 2009. What does the research say are the commercial bene ts? &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.realising-potential.org/six-building-blocks/commercial/what-researchers-&lt;/nowiki&gt; say.html&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; Many employers mentioned that being seen as pro-inclusion was positive for the company or organization's image, an advantage that goes well beyond&amp;nbsp;providing employment opportunities to disadvantaged groups. In many cases, however, social and cultural perceptions are an obstacle to making workplaces more inclusive, and this will require sensitive and concerted attention. Some low- and middle-income countries have sought to address this through legislation. In [[Tanzania]] the [[Disabled Persons (Employment) Act of 1982]] established a quota system that stipulates that 2 per cent of the workforce in companies with over fifty employees must be persons with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;SADC and UNESCO. 2011. ''Final Report: Status of TVET in the SADC Region''. Gaborone, SADC, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The 2012 [[Education for All Global Monitoring Report]] concluded that 'all countries, regardless of income level, need to pay greater attention to the needs of young people who face disadvantage in education and skills development by virtue of their poverty, gender or other characteristics'.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;UNESCO. 2012. ''Youth and Skills: Putting Education to Work''. EFA Global Monitoring Report. Paris, UNESCO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0021/002180/218003e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The report found that several barriers and constraints reduced the success of TVET in meeting social equity demands. First, national TVET policies in most cases failed to address the skills needs of young people living in urban poverty and in deprived rural areas. Second, additional funds were needed to support TVET learning opportunities on a much larger scale. Third, the training needs of disadvantaged young women were particularly neglected. The 2012 EFA Global Monitoring Report also noted that skills training alone was not sufficient for the most disadvantaged of the rural and urban poor.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Coherent policies that link social protection, micro-finance and TVET are considered critical for ensuring better outcomes for marginalized groups.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Gender disparities ===
Recent years have seen rising numbers of young women enrolling in TVET programmes, especially in service sector subjects. At times the challenge is to bring more males into female-dominated streams. However, beyond number games, the real gender parity test that TVET systems are yet to pass is balancing the gender participation in programmes that lead to employability, as well as to decent and high-paying jobs. Gender disparities in learning opportunities, and earnings, are a cause for concern. The persistent gender-typing of TVET requires concerted attention if TVET is to really serve a key facilitative role in shared growth, [[social equity]] and [[inclusive development]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002330/233030e.pdf|title=Unleashing the Potential: Transforming Technical and Vocational Education and Training|last=Marope|first=P.T.M|last2=Chakroun|first2=B.|last3=Holmes|first3=K.P.|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100091-1|location=|pages=20, 53, 85, 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of work, poor quality of work, lack of voice at work, continued gender discrimination and unacceptably high youth unemployment are all major drivers of TVET system reforms from the perspective of social equity. This is an area where TVET systems continue to be challenged to contribute proactively to the shaping of more equitable societies.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Gender equality has received significant international attention in recent years, and this has been reflected in a reduction in gender participation gaps in both [[Primary education|primary]] and [[Secondary education|secondary schooling]]. Efforts to analyse and address gender equality in TVET are relevant to other aspects of equity and dimensions of inclusion/exclusion. In almost all parts of the world, the proportion of girls to total enrolment in secondary education defined as TVET is less than for 'general' secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Institute for Statistics. 2012. ''Global Education Digest 2012. Opportunities Lost: The Impact of Grade Repetition and Early School Leaving''. Montreal, UIS.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Responses ====

===== Bangladesh =====
Integrating women or men into areas of specialization in which they were previously under-represented is important to diversifying opportunities for TVET. The [[National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality in TVET]] in [[Bangladesh]] set clear priorities and targets for breaking gender stereotypes. The Strategy developed by a Gender Working Group comprising  fifteen representatives from government ministries and departments, employers, workers and civil society organizations. It provided an overview of the current status and nature of gender inequalities in TVET, highlighted the priority areas for action, explored a number of steps to promote equal participation of women in TVET, and outlined the way forward.&lt;ref&gt;ILO. 2012b. ''Draft National Strategy for Promotion of Gender Equality in TVET''. Dhaka, ILO. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---asia/---ro-bangkok/---ilo-dhaka/&lt;/nowiki&gt; documents/publication/wcms_222688.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== Cambodia =====
In [[Cambodia]], TVET programmes set out to empower young women in traditional trades by upgrading their skills and technology in [[silk weaving]]. This led to the revitalization and reappraisal of a traditional craft by learners and society.&lt;ref&gt;Salzano, E. 2005. ''Technology-Based Training for Marginalised Girls''. Paris, UNESCO.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===== The Shanghai Consensus of the Third International Congress on TVET =====
The Shanghai Consensus of the Third International Congress on TVET made the following recommendations on expanding access and improving quality and equity, including to:&amp;nbsp;

"Improve [[gender equality]] by promoting equal access of females and males to TVET programmes, particularly in fields where there is strong labour market demand, and by ensuring that TVET curricula and materials avoid stereotyping by gender."&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO. 2012.

'''Tourism geography''' is the study of [[travel]] and [[tourism]], as an industry and as a [[social]] and [[culture|cultural]] activity. Tourism geography covers a wide range of interests including the environmental [[impacts of tourism|impact of tourism]], the geographies of tourism and leisure economies, answering tourism industry and management concerns and the sociology of tourism and locations of tourism.

Tourism geography is that branch of science which deals with the study of travel and its impact on places.

[[Geography]] is fundamental to the study of tourism, because tourism is geographical in nature. Tourism occurs in places, it involves movement and activities between places and it is an activity in which both place characteristics and personal self-identities are formed, through the relationships that are created among places, landscapes and people. Physical geography provides the essential background, against which tourism places are created and environmental impacts and concerns are major issues, that must be considered in managing the development of tourism places.

The approaches to study will differ according to the varying concerns. Much tourism management literature remains [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] in methodology and considers tourism as consisting of the places of tourist origin (or tourist generating areas), tourist destinations (or places of tourism supply) and the relationship (connections) between origin and destination places, which includes transportation routes, business relationships and traveler motivations.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin, A and Crang, M (2001) 'The trouble with tourism and travel theory?' in ''Tourist Studies'' 1(5) p.5-22&lt;/ref&gt; Recent developments in [[human geography]] have resulted in approaches such as those from [[cultural geography]], which take more theoretically diverse approaches to tourism, including a sociology of tourism, which extends beyond tourism as an isolated, exceptional activity and considering how travel fits into the everyday lives and how tourism is not only a consumptive of places, but also produces the [[sense of place]] at a destination.&lt;ref&gt;Larsen, J, Urry, J and Axhausen, K (2006) ''Mobilities, Networks, Geographies'' Aldershot:Ashgate&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Tourist'' by Dean MacCannell and ''The Tourist Gaze'' by [[John Urry (sociologist)|John Urry]] are classics in this field.

'''Tree box filters'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ianrpubs.unl.edu/epublic/live/ec701/build/ec701.pdf| "Stormwater Terminology" 2011. University of Nebraska Press Extension Curricular&lt;/ref&gt; are typically filtration systems installed under a street or sidewalk which have trees planted in them.  The systems collect [[stormwater]] runoff through methods such as permeable pavers or curb cuts.  The runoff is then filtered by soil, microbes and vegetation before either being utilized by the tree or discharged into a [[storm drain]] system.

==Benefits==

Tree box filters have the potential to improve the quality and health of street trees by providing larger areas for roots to stabilize the tree and more availability of water and nutrients. Additionally, the filters can delay the [[peak flow]] and improve the [[water quality]] of [[water]] entering a storm drain system. It is a practical management strategy for stormwater issues in urban settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Geronimo|first=Franz Kevin F.|last2=Maniquiz-Redillas|first2=Marla C.|last3=Kim|first3=Lee-Hyung|date=2013-05-01|title=Treatment of parking lot runoff by a tree box filter|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19443994.2013.781099|journal=Desalination and Water Treatment|volume=51|issue=19-21|pages=4044–4049|doi=10.1080/19443994.2013.781099|issn=1944-3994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mechanical engineering]], '''ultimate failure''' describes the breaking of a material.  In general there are two types of failure: [[fracture]] and [[buckling]].  Fracture of a material occurs when either an internal or external crack elongates the width or length of the material.  In ultimate failure this will result in one or more breaks in the material.  Buckling occurs when compressive loads are applied to the material and instead of cracking the material bows.  This is undesirable because most tools that are designed to be straight will be inadequate if curved.  If the buckling continues, it will create tension on the outer side of the bend and compression on the inner side, potentially fracturing the material.

In engineering there are multiple types of failure based upon the application of the material.  In many machine applications any change in the part due to yielding will result in the machine piece needing to be replaced.  Although this deformation or weakening of the material is not the technical definition of ultimate failure, the piece has failed.  In most technical applications pieces are rarely allowed to reach their ultimate failure or breakage point, instead for safety factors they are removed at the first signs of significant wear.

There are two different types of fracture: brittle and ductile.  Each of these types of failure occur based on the material's [[ductility]].  Brittle failure occurs with little to no plastic deformation before fracture.  An example of this would be stretching a clay pot or rod, when it is stretched it will not neck or elongate, but merely break into two or more pieces.  While applying a tensile stress to a ductile material, instead of immediately breaking the material will instead elongate.  The material will begin by elongating uniformly until it reaches the [[yield (engineering)|yield]] point, then the material will begin to neck.  When necking occurs the material will begin to stretch more in the middle and the radius will decrease.  Once this begins the material has entered a stage called plastic deformation.  Once the material has reached its [[ultimate tensile strength]] it will elongate more easily until it reaches ultimate failure and breaks.

An '''Ussing chamber''' is an apparatus for measuring epithelial membrane properties. It can detect and quantify transport and barrier functions of living tissue. The Ussing chamber was invented by the Danish [[zoologist]] and physiologist [[Hans Ussing|Hans Henriksen Ussing]] in 1946.&lt;ref name="goto"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222255/http://goto.glocalnet.net/medimet/ ''The Ussing Pulse project'' (goto.glocalnet.net)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is used to measure the short-circuit current as an indicator of net [[ion transport]] taking place across an [[epithelium]]. Ussing chambers are used to measure ion transport in native [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]], such as gut [[mucosa]], and in a monolayer of [[cell (biology)|cells]] grown on permeable supports.

== Function ==

The Ussing chamber provides a system to measure the transport of ions, nutrients, and drugs across various epithelial tissues.&lt;ref name="pmc"&gt;[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2697950/ ''A guide to Ussing chamber studies of mouse intestine'' (Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol. Jun 2009; 296(6): G1151–G1166. Published online Apr 2, 2009.)]&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of two halves separated by the epithelia (sheet of mucosa or monolayer of epithelial cells grown on permeable supports). Epithelia are polar in nature, i.e., they have an [[apical membrane|apical]] or mucosal side and a [[basolateral]] or [[serosal]] side. An Ussing chamber can isolate the apical side from the basolateral side. The two half chambers are filled with equal amounts of symmetrical [[Ringer solution]] to remove chemical, mechanical or electrical driving forces. Ion transport takes place across any epithelium. Transport may be in either direction. Ion transport produces a [[potential difference]] (voltage difference) across the epithelium. The voltage is measured using two voltage [[electrodes]] placed near the tissue/epithelium. This voltage is cancelled out by injecting current, using two other current electrodes placed away from the epithelium. This short-circuit current (Isc) is the measure of net ion transport.

Measuring epithelial ion transport is helped by Ussing chambers. The voltage result from this ion transport is easy to accurately measure. The epithelium pumps ions from one side to the other and the ions leak back through so-called tight junctions that are situated between the epithelial cells. To measure ion transport, an external current is applied. Simply cancelling the voltage underestimates the true value. This is corrected by a short circuit at the voltage measuring electrodes. The resistance between the external voltage electrodes must be considered. The Isc underestimates the ion transport: the error can be as much as 10-fold. The type of chambers suggested by Ussing produces large errors. This error is often estimated by measuring the voltage without tissue present, leading to uncertain values. Better methods involve using [[alternating current]] in the form of sinuous-shaped current using several frequencies, [[square wave]] pulses, sharp impulses and random noise.&lt;ref name="goto"/&gt;

{{Indian name|Ramachandran|Subramanian}}

'''Vilayanur Subramanian Ramachandran''' (born 10 August 1951) is a [[neuroscientist]] known primarily for his work in the fields of [[behavioral neurology]] and visual [[psychophysics]]. He is currently a Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Graduate Program in Neurosciences at the [[University of California, San Diego]]. Ramachandran is the author of several books that have garnered widespread public interest. These include ''[[Phantoms in the Brain]]'' (1998), "A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness" (2004) and ''The Tell-Tale Brain'' (2010).

Ramachandran has achieved both professional and popular recognition. He has published papers on a wide variety of topics in neuroscience. His  books, interviews, and lectures have helped build public interest in contemporary neuroscience. In 2011, [[Time Magazine|''Time'']] listed him as one of "the most influential people in the world" on the "Time 100 list".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2066367_2066369_2066125,00.html|title=The 2011 TIME 100 - TIME|last=Insel|first=Thomas|date=2011-04-21|work=Time|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Ramachandran (in accordance with some [[Surnames by country#India|Tamil family name]] traditions, the town of his family's origin, Vilayanur, is placed first) was born in 1951 in [[Tamil Nadu]], [[India]].&lt;ref name="Observer"&gt;{{cite web |author=Andrew Anthony |title=VS Ramachandran: The Marco Polo of neuroscience |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jan/30/observer-profile-vs-ramachandran |date=30 January 2011 |accessdate=11 December 2014 |publisher=guardian.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/05/11/brain-games|title=Brain Games|first=John|last=Colapinto|date=4 May 2009|publisher=|via=www.newyorker.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, V. M.

He then spent two years at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], as a research fellow working with [[Jack Pettigrew]].  He was appointed Assistant Professor of Psychology at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1983, and has been a full professor there since 1998.

==Scientific career==

Ramachandran's early research was on human visual perception using psychophysical methods to draw clear inferences about the brain mechanisms underlying visual processing. In the early 1990s Ramachandran began to focus on neurological syndromes such as [[phantom limb]]s, [[body integrity identity disorder]] and the [[Capgras delusion]]. He has also contributed to the understanding of [[synesthesia]]&lt;ref name="Colapinto" /&gt; and is known for inventing the [[mirror box]]. 

Ramachandran is noted for his use of experimental methods that make relatively little use of complex technologies such as [[neuroimaging]]. Despite the apparent simplicity of his approach, he has generated many new ideas about the [[brain]].&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, [https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/jan/30/observer-profile-vs-ramachandran VS Ramachandran: The Marco Polo of neuroscience], [[The Observer]], 29 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has encountered skepticism about some of his theories.&lt;ref&gt;Brugger, Peter, Book Review, Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Vol. 17, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has responded that "I have—for better or worse—roamed the whole landscape of visual perception, stereopsis, phantom limbs, denial of paralysis, Capgras syndrome, synaesthesia, and many others."&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandran,V.S. Author Response, Cognitive Neuropsychiatry, Vol. 17, Issue 4, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to his academic research Ramachanran has served as a consultant in areas such as forensic psychology and the neuroscience of weight reduction. In 2007, Ramachandran served as an [[expert witness]] on [[pseudocyesis]] (false pregnancy) at the trial of [[Lisa M. Montgomery]].&lt;ref&gt;AP,NBC website,Crime and Courts,10/17/2007[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/21351116/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/t/doctor-cites-mental-illness-fetus-theft-suspect/#.W7EuSWhKi01]&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran is currently serving as a consultant to a company (Modius) that is developing weight reduction technology that relies on electrically stimulating parts of the brain that control weight loss.&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach,Brad,Modius Intends To Buck The Trend Of Weight Loss Solutions With Data-Based Success And FDA Approval,Forbes,Mar 16, 2018,[https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradauerbach/2018/03/16/modius-intends-to-buck-the-trend-of-weight-loss-solutions-with-data-based-success-and-fda-approval/#b1a1ccc70bd4]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramachandran is the director of a research group at the University of California, San Diego, known as the Center for Brain and Cognition.&lt;ref name="cbc.ucsd.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbc.ucsd.edu/research.html|title=The Center for Brain and Cognition - Research|website=cbc.ucsd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/video/player/0,32068,912832862001_2066607,00.html|title=V.S.

Members of the CBC have published articles on a range of emerging theories related to neuroscience.&lt;ref name="cbc.ucsd.edu"/&gt; In 2012 Laura Case and Ramachancran published a theory about the possible role of brain plasticity in bigender alternation.&lt;ref&gt;Case,Ramachandran,[http://www.medical-hypotheses.com/article/S0306-9877(12)00062-X/abstract Alternating gender incongruity: A new neuropsychiatric syndrome providing insight into the dynamic plasticity of brain-sex], May 2012 Volume78,Issue5,Pages 626–631&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 Baland Jalal and Ramachandran published an article in which they speculated about the role of mirror neurons in the experience of the bedroom intruder during sleep paralysis.&lt;ref&gt;Jalal,Ramachandran,Sleep Paralysis, "The Ghostly Bedroom Intruder" and Out-of-Body Experiences: The Role of Mirror Neurons,Front.

===Theories and research===

====Phantom limbs====
{{main|Phantom limb}}
When an arm or leg is amputated, patients often continue to feel vividly the presence of the missing limb as a "phantom limb" (an average of 80%). Building on earlier work by [[Ronald Melzack]] (McGill University) and Timothy Pons (NIMH), Ramachandran theorized that there was a link between the phenomenon of phantom limbs and [[neural plasticity]] in the adult [[human brain]]. In 1993, working with T.T. Yang who was conducting [[magnetoencephalography|MEG]] research at the Scripps Research Institute,&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/tyang.html Yang, UCSD Faculty web page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331122737/http://psychiatry.ucsd.edu/faculty/tyang.html |date=31 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran demonstrated that there had been measurable changes in the somatosensory cortex of a patient who had undergone an arm amputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/00001756-199402000-00010 |pmid=8199341 |title=Noninvasive detection of cerebral plasticity in adult human somatosensory cortex |journal=NeuroReport |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=701–4 |year=1994 |last1=Yang |first1=T.

====Mirror visual feedback / Mirror Therapy====
{{main|Mirror box}}
[[File:Dr. Vilayanur S. Ramachandran and psychology student Matthew Marradi holding the original Mirror Box.jpg|thumb|Ramachandran standing next to the original [[mirror box]]]]
Ramachandran is credited with the invention of the mirror box and the introduction of mirror visual feedback (mirror therapy) as a treatment for phantom limb paralysis. Ramachandran found that in some cases restoring movement to a paralyzed phantom limb reduced pain as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1996.0058 |pmid=8637922 |title=Synaesthesia in Phantom Limbs Induced with Mirrors |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=263 |issue=1369 |pages=377–86 |year=1996 |last1=Ramachandran |first1=V. S |last2=Rogers-Ramachandran |first2=D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Systematic reviews of the research literature on mirror therapy (MT) have arrived at conflicting conclusions about the effectiveness of MT. A 2014 review found that MT can exert a strong influence on the motor network, mainly through increased cognitive penetration in action control.&lt;ref&gt;Deconinck,Smorenburg,Benham,Ledebt,Feltham,Savelsbergh,Reflections on mirror therapy: a systematic review of the effect of mirror visual feedback on the brain,Neurorehabil Neural Repair,2015,May29(4),349-61[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25160567]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2016 review concluded that the level of evidence is insufficient to recommend MT as a first intention treatment for phantom limb pain.&lt;ref&gt;Barbin,Seethaa,Casillasc,Paysantd,Pérennou,Annals of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine,Volume 59, Issue 4, September 2016,Pages270-275&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Neural cross-wiring: synesthesia====
[[File:synaesthesiatest.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Synesthetes who experience color when viewing different symbols may quickly identify the presence of the "triangle" in the left-hand image.]]
{{main|Synesthesia}}
Ramachandran was one of the first scientists to theorize that grapheme-color synesthesia arises from a cross-activation between brain regions.&lt;ref name="ramachandran2001"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ramachandran VS, Hubbard EM|lastauthoramp=yes |title=Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=3–34 |year=2001 |month= |pmid= |doi= |url=http://cbc.ucsd.edu/pdf/Synaesthesia%20-%20JCS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15797557"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.02.008 |pmid=15797557 |title=Individual Differences among Grapheme-Color Synesthetes: Brain-Behavior Correlations |journal=Neuron |volume=45 |issue=6 |pages=975–85 |year=2005 |last1=Hubbard |first1=Edward M |last2=Arman |first2=A. Cyrus |last3=Ramachandran |first3=Vilayanur S |last4=Boynton |first4=Geoffrey M }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran and his graduate student, Ed Hubbard, conducted research with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] that found increased activity in [[Visual cortex#V4|the color recognition areas of the brain]] in synesthetes compared to non-synesthetes.&lt;ref name="pmid15797557" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16269367"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2005.10.012 |pmid=16269367 |title=Neurocognitive Mechanisms of Synesthesia |journal=Neuron |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=509–20 |year=2005 |last1=Hubbard |first1=Edward M |last2=Ramachandran |first2=V.S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ramachandran has speculated that conceptual metaphors may have a neurological basis in cortical cross-activation, as well. However,the neurological basis of synesthesia is not well understood.&lt;ref&gt;Hupel,Jean-Michel,Dojat,Michel,A critical review of the neuroimaging literature on synesthesia,Frontiers In Human Neuroscience,2015,9,103,Published online 2015 Mar 3 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379872/]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mirror neurons====
{{main|Mirror neuron}}

Ramachandran's theories about the role of mirror neurons have attracted a great deal of discussion and debate.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett,Christian, A Calm Look At The Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience -- Mirror Neurons,Wired,Science, 12,13,2013[https://www.wired.com/2013/12/a-calm-look-at-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience-mirror-neurons/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Costandi,Mo,Reflecting on mirror neurons,Neurophilosophy,The Guardian,23 August 2013[https://www.theguardian.com/science/neurophilosophy/2013/aug/23/mirror-neurons]&lt;/ref&gt; (Mirror neurons were first reported in a paper published in 1992 by a team of researchers led by [[Giacomo Rizzolatti]] at the [[University of Parma]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s00221-009-2002-3 |pmid=19760408 |title=Mirror neurons: From discovery to autism |journal=Experimental Brain Research |volume=200 |issue=3–4 |pages=223–37 |year=2009 |last1=Rizzolatti |first1=Giacomo |last2=Fabbri-Destro |first2=Maddalena }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran has speculated that research into the role of mirror neurons will help explain a variety of human mental capacities such as empathy, imitation learning, and the evolution of language. In 2000, Ramachandran made a prediction that "mirror neurons will do for psychology what DNA did for biology: they will provide a unifying framework and help explain a host of mental abilities that have hitherto remained mysterious and inaccessible to experiments."&lt;ref name=Jarrett2012PT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/brain-myths/201212/mirror-neurons-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience |title=Mirror Neurons: The Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience? |first=Christian |last=Jarrett |work=Psychology Today |date=10 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron-Cohen, Making Sense of the Brain's Mysteries, American Scientist, On-line Book Review, July–August, 2011 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111014003257/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/making-sense-of-the-brains-mysteries]&lt;/ref&gt; However, over the past ten years, many of the exciting theories about mirror neurons have not held up under scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor,John,Mirror Neurons After a Quarter Century: New light, new cracks,Science In The News (web article)Harvard University,Aug 29,2016[http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2016/mirror-neurons-quarter-century-new-light-new-cracks/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===="Broken Mirrors" theory of autism====
{{main|Autism#Pathophysiology|l1=Autism: Pathophysiology}}
In 1999, Ramachandran, in collaboration with then post-doctoral fellow Eric Altschuler and colleague Jaime Pineda, hypothesized that a loss of [[mirror neurons]] might be the key deficit that explains many of the symptoms and signs of autism spectrum disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |author=E.L.

Ramachandran's "broken mirrors hypothesis" explanation for autism remains controversial.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Jarrett,A Calm Look at the Most Hyped Concept in Neuroscience - Mirror Neurons,Wired,13 December 2013,[https://www.wired.com/2013/12/a-calm-look-at-the-most-hyped-concept-in-neuroscience-mirror-neurons/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fan,Y.T.;Decety,J.;Yang,C.Y.;Liu,J.L.; Cheng,Y, "Unbroken mirror neurons in autism spectrum disorders",Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry,26 May 2010 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-7610.2010.02269.x/abstract]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Xenomelia (Apotemnophilia)====
{{main|Body Identity Integrity Disorder}}
In 2008, Ramachandran, along with David Brang and Paul McGeoch, published the first paper to theorize that [[apotemnophilia]] is a neurological disorder caused by damage to the right [[parietal lobe]] of the brain.&lt;ref name="brang2008"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e32830abc4d |pmid=18695512 |title=Apotemnophilia: A neurological disorder |journal=NeuroReport |volume=19 |issue=13 |pages=1305–6 |year=2008 |last1=Brang |first1=David |last2=McGeoch |first2=Paul D |last3=Ramachandran |first3=Vilayanur S }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This rare disorder, in which a person desires the amputation of a limb, was first identified by [[John Money]] in 1977. Building on medical case studies that linked brain damage to syndromes such as [[somatoparaphrenia]] (lack of limb ownership) the authors speculated that the desire for amputation could be related to changes in the right parietal lobe. In 2011 McGeoch, Brang and Ramachandran reported a functional imaging experiment involving four subjects who desired lower limb amputations. MEG scans demonstrated that their right superior parietal lobules were significantly less active in response to tactile stimulation of a limb that the subjects wished to have amputated, as compared to age/sex matched controls. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/jnnp-2011-300224 |pmid=21693632 |title=Xenomelia: A new right parietal lobe syndrome |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery &amp; Psychiatry |volume=82 |issue=12 |pages=1314–9 |year=2011 |last1=McGeoch |first1=P. D |last2=Brang |first2=D |last3=Song |first3=T |last4=Lee |first4=R. R |last5=Huang |first5=M |last6=Ramachandran |first6=V. S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors introduced the word "Xenomelia" to describe this syndrome, which is derived from the Greek for "foreign" and "limb".

As of 2014, there was no medical consensus as to the cause of this condition.&lt;ref&gt;Sedda,Anna,Bottini,Gabriella, Apotemnophilia, body integrity identity disorder or xenomelia? Psychiatric and neurologic etiologies face each other,Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment, 2014;10: 1255–1265.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4094630/]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Awards and honors==

Ramachandran was elected to a visiting fellowship at [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford]] (1998–1999). In addition, he was a Hilgard visiting professor at [[Stanford University]] in 2005. He has received honorary doctorates from Connecticut College (2001) and the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras (2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.neucom.2006.02.024 |title=EEG evidence for mirror neuron activity during the observation of human and robot actions: Toward an analysis of the human qualities of interactive robots |journal=Neurocomputing |volume=70 |issue=13–15 |pages=2194–203 |year=2007 |last1=Oberman |first1=Lindsay M |last2=McCleery |first2=Joseph P |last3=Ramachandran |first3=Vilayanur S |last4=Pineda |first4=Jaime A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ramachandran received the annual [[Ramon y Cajal]] award (2004) from the International Neuropsychiatric Society,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inawebsite.org/ramon-y-cajal-award|title=International Neuropsychiatric Associatio|website=International Neuropsychiatric Associatio}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ariëns Kappers Medal]] from the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences]] for his contributions to Neuroscience (1999).

'''Women in music education''' describes the role of [[Women in music|women musicians, conductors, teachers and educational administrators]] in [[music education]] at the [[elementary school]] and [[secondary education]] levels. While [[music critic]]s argued in the 1880s that "...women lacked the innate creativity to compose good music" due to "biological predisposition",&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parlorsongs.com/issues/2002-9/thismonth/feature.php |title=Women Composers In American Popular Song, Page 1 |publisher=Parlorsongs.com |date=1911-03-25 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, it was accepted that women would have a role in [[music education]], and they became involved in this field "...to such a degree that women dominated music education during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century."&lt;ref name="parlorsongs.com"/&gt; "Traditional accounts of the history of music education [in the US] have often neglected the contributions of women, because these texts have emphasized bands and the top leaders in hierarchical music organizations." &lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"&gt;Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe. "Women Music Educators In The United States: A History", in ''GEMS (Gender, Education, Music, and Society)'', the on-line journal of Gender Research in Music Education. Vol 8, No 4 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; When looking beyond these bandleaders and top leaders, women had many music education roles in the "...home, community, churches, public schools, and teacher-training institutions" and "...as writers, patrons, and through their volunteer work in organizations."&lt;ref name="Sandra Wieland Howe 2015"/&gt;

Despite the limitations imposed on women's roles in music education in the 19th century, women were accepted as [[kindergarten]] teachers, because this was deemed to be a "private sphere". Women also taught music privately, in girl's schools, Sunday schools, and they trained musicians in school music programs. By the turn of the 20th century, women began to be employed as music supervisors in elementary schools, teachers in [[normal school]]s and professors of music in universities. Women also became more active in professional organizations in music education, and women presented papers at conferences.

A woman, Frances Clarke (1860–1958) founded the [[National Association for Music Education|Music Supervisors National Conference]] in 1907. While a small number of women served as President of the Music Supervisors National Conference (and the following renamed versions of the organization over the next century) in the early 20th century, there were only two female Presidents between 1952 and 1992, which "[p]ossibly reflects discrimination." After 1990, however, leadership roles for women in the organization opened up. From 1990 to 2010, there were five female Presidents of this organization.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/bigbadbariguru/a-historical-view-of-women-in-music-education-careers |title=A historical view of women in music education careers |publisher=Slideshare.net |date=2012-07-05 |accessdate=2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women music educators "outnumber men two-to-one" in teaching general music, choir, private lessons, and keyboard instruction.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; More men tend to be hired as for band education, administration and jazz jobs, and more men work in colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt; According to Dr. Sandra Wieland Howe, there is still a "[[glass ceiling]]" for women in music education careers, as there is "stigma" associated with women in leadership positions and "men outnumber women as administrators."&lt;ref name="slideshare.net"/&gt;

'''Worst case analysis''' was, from 1978 until 1986, a doctrine under {{USC|40|1502.22}} which mandated that an [[environmental impact statement]] include such an analysis:&lt;ref&gt;19 [[Environmental Law Reporter|ELR]] 10026: [https://elr.info/sites/default/files/articles/19.10026.htm "Worst Case Analysis: The Final Chapter?"], by Vicki O'Meara Masterman&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|
When an agency is evaluating [[significant adverse effects]] on the human environment in an environmental impact statement and there are gaps in relevant information or scientific uncertainty, the agency shall always make clear that such information is lacking or that uncertainty exists.

(a) If the information relevant to [[adverse impacts]] is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and is not known and the overall costs of obtaining it are not exorbitant, the agency shall include the information in the environmental impact statement.

(b) If (1) the information relevant to adverse impacts is essential to a reasoned choice among alternatives and is not known and the overall costs of obtaining it are exorbitant or (2) the information is relevant to adverse impacts, is important to the decision and the means to obtain it are not known (e.g., the means for obtaining it are beyond the state of the art) the agency shall weigh the need for the action against the risk and severity of possible adverse impacts were the action to proceed in the face of uncertainty. If the agency proceeds, it shall include a '''worst case analysis''' and an indication of the probability or improbability of its occurrence.

'''YIVO''' ([[Yiddish]]: {{lang|yi|ייִוואָ}}, {{IPA-yi|jiˈvɔ|}}), established in 1925 in Wilno in the [[Second Polish Republic]] (now [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]) as the '''''Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut''''' ([[Yiddish]]: {{lang|yi|ייִדישער װיסנשאַפֿטלעכער אינסטיטוט}}, {{IPA-yi|ˈjidiʃɛr ˈvisən.ʃaftlɛχɛr instiˈtut|pron}}, '''Yiddish Scientific Institute'''&lt;ref name="yivo"&gt;[http://www.yivo.org/about yivo]&lt;/ref&gt;), is an organization that preserves, studies, and teaches the cultural history of Jewish life throughout Eastern Europe, Germany, and Russia as well as [[orthography]], [[lexicography]], and other studies related to [[Yiddish]]. (The word ''yidisher'' means both "Yiddish" and "Jewish.") The English name of the organization was changed to the '''Institute for Jewish Research''' after its relocation to New York City, but it is still known mainly by its Yiddish acronym. YIVO is now a member of the [[Center for Jewish History]] and serves as the ''[[de facto]]'' recognized [[List of language regulators|language regulator]] of the Yiddish language.

==Activities==
YIVO preserves manuscripts, rare books, and diaries, and other Yiddish sources.  The YIVO Library in New York contains over 385,000 volumes&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt; dating from as early as the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivo.org/about/ YIVO Institute for Jewish Research | Brief Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yivo.org/index.php?aid=195&amp;tid=75 YIVO Institute for Jewish Research | Overview of Library Collections&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The YIVO archives hold over 24,000,000 documents, photographs, recordings, posters, films, and other artifacts.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt; Together, they comprise the world's largest collection of materials related to the history and culture of Central and [[East European Jewry]] and the [[American Jewish]] immigrant experience.&lt;ref name="yivo" /&gt;  The archives and library collections Include works in twelve major languages,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.yivo.org/library/ YIVO Institute for Jewish Research | Overview&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; including [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]],  [[German language|German]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Judaeo-Spanish]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

YIVO also functions as a publisher of Yiddish-language books and of periodicals including ''YIVO Bleter''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yivo.org/about/index.php?tid=75&amp;aid=177 YIVO Institute for Jewish Research | YIVO in the United States&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (founded 1931), ''Yedies Fun YIVO'' (founded 1929), and ''Yidishe Shprakh'' (founded 1941). It is also responsible for English-language publications such as the ''YIVO Annual of Jewish Social Studies'' (founded 1946).

==History==
YIVO was initially proposed by Yiddish [[linguistics|linguist]] and writer [[Nochum Shtif]] (1879–1933). He characterized his advocacy of Yiddish as "realistic" [[Zionism]], contrasted to the "visionary" [[Modern Hebrew|Hebraists]] and the "self-hating" [[cultural assimilation|assimilationists]] who adopted [[Russian language|Russian]] or [[Polish language|Polish]]. Other key founders included [[philology|philologist]] [[Max Weinreich]] (1894–1969) and historian [[Elias Tcherikower]] (1881–1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Liptzin |first=Sol|year=1972|title=A History of Yiddish Literature|publisher=Jonathan David Publishers|location=Middle Village, NY|isbn=0-8246-0124-6|pages=127–130, 133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

YIVO was founded at a [[Berlin]] conference in 1925, but headquartered in Wilno, a city with a large Jewish population that had been annexed to Eastern Poland in 1922. The early YIVO also had branches in [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]] and New York City. Over the next decade, smaller groups arose in many of the other countries with [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] populations.

In YIVO's first decades, Tcherikover headed the historical research section, which also included [[Simon Dubnow]], [[Saul M. Ginsburg]], [[Abraham Menes]], and [[Jacob Shatzky]]. [[Leibush Lehrer]] (1887–1964) headed a section including psychologists and educators [[Abraham Golomb]], [[H. S. Kasdan]], and [[Abraham Aaron Roback]]. [[Jacob Lestschinsky]] (1876–1966) headed a section of economists and demographers [[Ben-Adir]], [[Liebmann Hersch]], and [[Moshe Shalit]]. Weinreich's language and literature section included [[Judah Leib Cahan]], [[Alexander Harkavy]], [[Judah A. Joffe]], [[Zelig Kalmanovich]], [[Shmuel Niger]], [[Noach Pryłucki]], and [[Zalman Reisen]].&lt;ref&gt;Liptzin, 1972, 130, 133&lt;/ref&gt; YIVO also collected and preserved ethnographic materials under the direction of its Ethnographic Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=1552569|title=Guide to the Records of the YIVO Ethnographic Committeeundated, 1885-1941RG 1.2|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1925, YIVO's honorary board of trustees or "Curatorium" consisted of [[Simon Dubnow]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Moses Gaster]], [[Edward Sapir]] and [[Chaim Zhitlowsky]].

From 1934–1940, YIVO operated a graduate training program known as the Aspirantur. Named after [[Zemach Shabad]], YIVO’s chairman, the program held classes and guided students in conducting original research in the field of Jewish studies. Many of the students' projects were sociological in nature (reflecting the involvement of [[Max Weinreich]]) and gathered information on contemporary Jewish life in the Vilna region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=1638048|title=Guide to the Records of the YIVO Aspirantur1934-1940RG 1.3|publisher=|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] advance into Eastern Europe caused YIVO to move its operations to New York City. A second important center, known as the Fundacion IWO, was established in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwo.org.ar/english/index.html |title= Fundación IWO  |publisher= |accessdate=4 August 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812123637/http://www.iwo.org.ar/english/index.html |archivedate=12 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All four directors of YIVO's research sections were already in the Americas when the war broke out or were able to make their way there.&lt;ref&gt;Liptzin, 1972, 3, 133&lt;/ref&gt; For their own reasons, the Nazis carried the bulk of YIVO's archives to Berlin, where the papers survived the war intact, and were eventually moved to YIVO in New York City.

The YIVO Library was looted by the Germans and the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce|ERR]], but an organization that called itself "[[Paper Brigade|The Paper Brigade]]" were able to smuggle out many books and preserve them from destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Fishman, David E. [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982090807 The Book Smugglers: Partisans, Poets, and the Race to Save Jewish Treasures from the Nazis]. 2017.n&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago YIVO Society is a third active center today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagoyivo.org|title=Chicago Yivo Society|work=Chicago Yivo Society|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
YIVO has undertaken many major scholarly publication projects, the most recent being ''[[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]]'', published in March 2008 in cooperation with Yale University Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/book.asp?isbn=9780300119039 |title=The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe - Hundert, Gershon David; YIVO Institute for Jewish Research - Yale University Press |publisher=Yalepress.yale.edu |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the leadership of editor-in-chief [[Gershon David Hundert]], professor of history and of Jewish Studies at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], this unprecedented reference work systematically represents the history and culture of Eastern European Jews from their first settlement in the region to the present day. More than 1,800 alphabetical entries encompass a vast range of topics including religion, folklore, politics, art, music, theater, language and literature, places, organizations, intellectual movements, and important figures. The two-volume set also features more than 1,000 illustrations and 55 maps. With original contributions from an international team of 450 distinguished scholars, the encyclopedia covers the region between Germany and the [[Ural Mountains]], from which more than 2.5 million Jews emigrated to the United States between 1870 and 1920.

The first complete English-language edition of Max Weinreich's classic book ''[[History of the Yiddish Language]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Yale University Press]], 2008&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Dr. [[Paul (Hershl) Glasser]], was published in two volumes in 2008.
