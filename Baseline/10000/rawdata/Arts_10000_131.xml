'''18th-century American piracy of [[British literature]]''' refers to the practice of reprinting British books in the United States without the permission of the original author or publisher.

[[Plagiarism]] is traditionally defined as “the process of copying another person's idea or written work and claiming it as original” &lt;ref&gt;Guralnik, D: '''Webster's New World Dictionary''', page 1087. Collins World 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition applies to many aspects of written work in today’s world and has serious consequences if found guilty of committing it, but this idea has not always been in place. During the 18th century, it was extremely common for British Literature to be reprinted across the Atlantic Ocean in America without any acknowledgment or payment given to the original author. This form of plagiarism, referred to as literary piracy, was not an easy action to control because of the immense distance between the two countries, and the lack of any real international law which would work to protect the original authors in England. It was not until 1988 that these international laws were truly set in place and able to be enforced with any form of consistency.

==Early piracy==
Although it is now believed to be a crime, plagiarism has not always been considered a negative action. Thoughts, ideas, and writing were considered public property, not something an individual was able to claim as their own &lt;ref name=lynch&gt;Lynch, Jack (2002) [http://www.writing-world.com/rights/lynch.shtml ''The Perfectly Acceptable Practice of Literary Theft: Plagiarism, Copyright, and the Eighteenth Century''], in ''[http://www.history.org/foundation/journal/index.cfm Colonial Williamsburg: The Journal of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation]'' 24, no. 4 (Winter 2002–3), pp.&amp;nbsp;51–54. Also available online since 2006 at ''Writing World''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The ”borrowing” from others was thought of as a form of learning and was encouraged as an opportunity to enhance one's work. It was used as a stepping stone during the creative process. In order to create new stories, plots, and characters for a narrative, it was only natural for authors to look at what others before them had done.&lt;ref name="Wrong"&gt;Stearns, Laurie: ''Copy wrong: plagiarism, process, property and the law'', California Law Review 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between this recycling of ideas and copying is that an author will add original material to the inspiration, not simply recopy what came prior. Borrowing was deemed acceptable if it is only part of the final result and has a distinct twist from the original piece.  A prime example of accepted plagiarism can be found in Shakespeare, who “borrowed” from other authors and playwrights of his day in order to create almost all of his now famous plays. The term plagiarism originally comes from the Latin word for thief, in this case, a literary thief.

==Establishment of copyright laws==
London was the first city where authors were able to rightly protect themselves and their ideas after the first copyright law, known as the [[Statute of Anne]],  passed in 1710.&lt;ref name=lynch /&gt; The specific purpose of this statute was “the encouragement of learned men to compose and write useful books”.&lt;ref name=lynch /&gt; This act not only protected authors in Britain, it also worked to protect the authors who had works being brought across the Atlantic to be reprinted without receiving any compensation for their literature. In 1880 the first international copyright laws were proposed by Mr. Edward Thorton in order to prevent this piracy from occurring and establishing consequences if it did (5). This treaty gave British authors protection in America and vice versa, allowing for consequences to follow the rules for the country of original publication. Pirated copies of novels and musical pieces were prohibited. It took over 100 years after these laws were proposed for the United States to fully cooperate with them.&lt;ref name=lynch /&gt;

==International piracy==
During the 18th century, the plagiarists and literary thieves (pirates) would bring British novels back to America, reprint them (with the original author’s name in order to escape incrimination, but still using another author's work for their own personal gain), and yet never give the original author any compensation for their work.&lt;ref name=lynch /&gt; This system fell into place largely because the nation did not have any real individual literary identity at that point in time.&lt;ref name="Phegley"&gt;Phegley, Jennifer: ''Literary Piracy, Nationalism, and Women Readers in [[Harper's New Monthly Magazine]], 1850-1855 American Periodicals: A Journal of History, Criticism, and Bibliography'', pages 63–90. The Ohio State University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, the United States was still in the early stages of its independent development as a nation and most of what the new American public was comfortable with involved British culture and ideas. These pirated novels had already established a reputation and success in England and were therefore not a risk to publishers in the States, who already knew that there would likely be a success in the New World. In some cases, these pirated novels were more accessible in America than they were to the British where they were originally printed.&lt;ref name="Phegley" /&gt; Although novels were a large portion of the pirated works from England, magazines, and newspapers were included in the stolen works as well.

One primary example can be seen in ''[[Harper's New Monthly Magazine]]'', a magazine that was aimed at women and attempted to create a patriotic attitude in the developing nation.&lt;ref name="Phegley" /&gt; Harper’s ideas and strategies involved exposing these women to the British form of "elevated" culture in an effort to increase the standard and quality of the new American literature, which would result from the British inspiration they provided in their magazine. It was formerly believed that because of America's lack of a social class system, there would be no real need for a strong literary tradition. Harper's tried to expose the British tradition in order to facilitate growth for the American tradition. They sold for a low cost because there was no compensation being paid to the original authors back in England for the sole purpose of exposing every educated person in the new American public to "the unbounded treasures of the periodical literature of the present day".&lt;ref name="Phegley" /&gt;

The important thing was not the actual content of the magazines or their national origin but more about how much circulation and exposure these pieces received. This feeling of inspiration eventually backfired when the American authors were intimidated by the intense connection and dependence on British authors and did not produce many.&lt;ref name="Phegley" /&gt; Eventually, the resentment for the lack of Americanism led to a change in Harper's to include more national, not international, authors. This change never really paid off and the magazine did not see the same amount of success and profit that it received from the British pirated material.

'''''Across the black soil plans''''' is a [[1899 in art|1899]] painting by Australian artist [[George Washington Lambert]]. The landscape depicts a team of draft horses pulling a wagon heavily laden with wool bales. Lambert's "best known bush image", ''Across the black soil plains'' was awarded the [[Wynne Prize]] in 1899.&lt;ref name=Retrospective&gt;{{cite web|title=Across the black soil plains 1899|url=http://nga.gov.au/Exhibition/Lambert/Detail.cfm?IRN=162263|website=George W Lambert Retrospective|publisher=National Gallery of Australia|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting had its inspiration in Lambert's experiences in droving sheep, seeing "horse teams hauling heavily laden wool wagons across the bare, miry, flat lands of Snakes Plain from [[Warren, New South Wales|Warren]] to the railway station at [[Nevertire, New South Wales|Nevertire]].".&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt; 
{{quote|As a boy in the bush I did much work with draft [sic] horses ... [One] called Barney had such fine action and such imposing carriage ... and possibly what knowledge I displayed in connection with horses in ‘Black Soil Plains’ originated with my association with this exceptionally fine animal|George Washington Lambert|&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt;}}

Lambert composed the painting in a shed at its mother's house in [[Hornsby, New South Wales|Hornsby]], a suburb of Sydney. When working on the painting, Lambert placed the long and narrow canvas diagonally in the shed. Several names have been suggested as the model for the [[teamster]], including Jim Smith from the Warren district, Luke Rollins from [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]] or Henry Sharkey, who carted a record load of wool from [[Louth, New South Wales|Louth]] to [[Bourke, New South Wales|Bourke]].&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt; 

The painting was a critical success with the ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]]'' stating "‘In this long narrow canvas the young artist paints with astonishing vigour and sense of movement ... in every conceivable attitude the horses tug and strain at the heavy load."&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt;

The painting was acquired by the Art Gallery of New South Wales at the New South Wales Society of Artists exhibition in 1899 and remains part of its collection.&lt;ref name=Retrospective /&gt;&lt;ref name=AGNSW&gt;{{cite web|title=Across the black soil plains|url=http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/works/550/|website=Collection|publisher=Art Gallery of New South Wales|accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Babe's Dream''''' is a 1995 bronze statue of [[Babe Ruth]], by Susan Luery.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=708&lt;/ref&gt;
It is located at West Camden Street and South Eutaw Street, at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]], [[Baltimore]].

The statue contains an error in that Ruth is depicted with a right-handed fielder's glove, for wear on the left hand.&lt;ref name="The Wrong Glove"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-06-12/news/1995163079_1_glove-babe-ruth-catcher-mitt |publisher=''Baltimore Sun''| date=June 12, 1995| author=Jon Morgan| title=The Wrong Glove on the Right Man | accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth threw left-handed.&lt;ref name="The Wrong Glove" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/ruthba01.shtml |title=Babe Ruth | publisher=Baseball-Reference.com| accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statue==
Although he became famous as a Yankee, George Herman Ruth’s roots are from Baltimore. where he was born, grew up, and learned how to play baseball. ''Babe's Dream'' portrays Ruth as a young man, about the time he started out as a rookie, as Luery wanted to portray Babe’s longing for the big leagues and to find an escape from his harsh childhood.

Ruth was born on February 6, 1895, to hardworking parents, who couldn’t support a child that caused as much “mischief” as Babe. At age seven, his parents decided to “straighten him out” by sending him to Baltimore’s St. Mary’s Industrial School for Boys, where he could learn how to have more discipline. This turned out to be the beginning of the stars true love for the game of baseball. 

Babe Ruth is a legend in the world of baseball. He played baseball for 22 years, setting the records for home runs at 714 and holding that record until 1974 when [[Hank Aaron]] surpassed it.  Ruth is credited with changing the game of baseball in America, and his hometown wanted to present his accomplishments by dedicating a statue to him and his legend.

Luery portrayed Ruth as a fierce competitor as he is gazing out into the future.  “A man looking at his destiny,” is how Susan Luery put it.  “His poise was in the sense of determination that he was a great player,” she said.  “He’s facing out – he had everything in front of him. Ruth’s career rose pretty much straight into the record books from there.” 

==Artist==
Susan Luery was born in Baltimore, Maryland, and attended the Maryland Institute College of Art where she learned to refine her work. Luery researched Ruth by reading books and talking to people with both knowledge of Ruth and baseball so she could “connect” with the subject. She also had a look-alike model come to her studio while she worked on the statue. It took her seven months to form the 28-inch model statue before creating the large-scale version. 

She produced the 16-foot statue a year later, in 1994, and it was placed in the Camden Yards on Babe Ruth’s 100th birthday in February 1995. The statue was officially unveiled at an Oriole’s game where Luery and Ruth’s daughter, Julia Ruth Stevens, threw out the game ball in celebration.

The '''Belgrade Drama Theatre''' ({{lang-sr|Београдско драмско позориште|Beogradsko dramsko pozorište}}; abbr. '''BDP''') is a theatre located in [[Belgrade]], Serbia.

==History==
Belgrade Drama Theatre was founded in August 1947, and it was the first city theater formed in [[Belgrade]] after the [[Second World War]]. The first opening night of "The Youth of the Fathers" by [[Boris Gorbatov]] staged by Petar S. Petrović was performed on the stage on 20 February 1948. The building on [[Crveni Krst (Belgrade)|Crveni Krst]], in which this theater is nowadays, was opened in the season of 1948/49, and the first opening night performed on this stage was "Sumnjivo lice" by [[Branislav Nušić]], produced by Bosnian Salko Repak, on 20 March 1949. In the period from 1959 to 1975, BDP, with Belgrade Comedy, made one theater house - "Contemporary Theater", and in December 1975, it became the Belgrade Drama Theater again.

In the mid-1950s and in the beginning of the 1960s, BDP had its "golden" period, mostly owing to particularly successful performances of the works of contemporary American playwrights and a brilliant galaxy of actors, stage managers, stage designers, costume designers, who, with their talents, made the reputation of the stage on Crveni Krst. The legendary performances of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'', ''[[Cat on a Hot Tin Roof]]'', ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', ''[[Mother Courage and Her Children]]'', ''[[A View from the Bridge]]'' and other contemporary classics came near the cult status among the theatergoers.

Today, BDP works with a repertory artistic company and carries on the tradition created by performances of the classic and [[avant-garde]] dramatic literature, whereby it has created and maintained its recognizable style and artistic expression. In the spring of 2003, a thorough reconstruction of the theater building was completed, bringing it to the level of high European standards.

The film ''Carmen, Baby'', according to one reviewer, was the beginning of Metzger's successful style in his later films: that is, adapting "a literary classic in a gorgeous European locale with high polish and a goodly helping of sophisticated sex and seduction."&lt;ref name="UCLA-20110609"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Carmen, Baby (1967), Little Mother (Germany/Yugoslavia/US, 1972) |url=https://www.cinema.ucla.edu/events/2011-06-09/carmen-baby-1967-little-mother-germanyyugoslaviaus-1972 |date=June 9, 2011 |work=[[UCLA]] |accessdate=April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic Jesse Vogel noted that the film is an example of Metzger's signature style, "cool, classy, distant, with a distinctively European sensibility".&lt;ref name="EFC-19671010"&gt;{{cite web |last=Vogel |first=Jesse |title=Carmen, Baby |url=http://www.efilmcritic.com/review.php?movie=5824&amp;reviewer=223 |date=October 10, 1967 |work=eFilmCritic.com |accessdate=April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to film reviewer Gary Morris, ''Carmen'' was "well played" by Uta Levka; lighting and camerawork by [[Hans Jura]] was "first-rate".&lt;ref name="BLF-19991101"&gt;{{cite web |last=Morris |first=Gary |title=Radley Metzger: The Dirty Girls, Carmen Baby, The Princess and the Call Girl on DVD |url=http://brightlightsfilm.com/radley-metzger-dirty-girls-carmen-baby-princess-call-girl-dvd/ |date=November 1, 1999 |work=[[Bright Lights Film Journal]] |accessdate=April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Another reviewer wrote that the film had "a rather classy look" and that the performers were "attractive" and the setting  "beautiful".&lt;ref name="NYT-19671011"&gt;{{cite news |author=Staff |title='Carmen' Updated |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9800E0DA173EE63BBC4952DFB667838C679EDE |date=October 11, 1967 |work=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=April 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal issues==
In the case of ''[[Rabe v. Washington]]'', 405 U.S. 313 (1972), the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decided that the manager of a [[Drive-in theater|drive-in movie theater]] could not be charged with [[obscenity]] for showing the film which was not wholly determined to be obscene, but only parts were, holding that the citizens of Washington State had no [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution#Notice of accusation|notice under the Sixth Amendment]] that the place where a film was shown was an [[Element (criminal law)|element of the offense]].  

==Popular culture==
[[Wally Lamb]] mentioned the bottle dance scene from ''Carmen, Baby'' in his 2016 book ''I'll Take You There''.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4925">A '''chain of title''' is the sequence of historical transfers of [[title (property)|title]] to a [[property]]. It is a valuable tool to identify and document past owners of a property and serves as a property’s historical ownership timeline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.envirositecorp.com/products/environmental-property-assessment-data/chain-of-title-report/ Chain of Title Report]&lt;/ref&gt; The "chain" runs from the present owner back to the original owner of the property. In situations where documentation of ownership is important, it is often necessary to reconstruct the chain of title. To facilitate this, a record of title documents may be maintained by a registry office or [[civil law notary]].

==Chain of title for real property==

[[Real estate]] is one field where the chain of title has considerable significance. Various registration systems, such as the [[Torrens title]] system, have been developed to track the ownership of individual pieces of [[real property]]. In real estate transactions in the United States, insurance companies issue [[title insurance]] based upon the chain of title to the property when it is transferred. Title insurance companies sometimes maintain private title plants that track real estate titles in addition to the official records.  In other cases, the chain of title is established by an [[abstract of title]], sometimes, although not always, certified by an [[Lawyer|attorney]].  In the United States, some holders of mortgage debt may be unable to establish chain of title, despite the fact that clear chain of title can be required by the mortgage holder before foreclosure can proceed.  Widespread lack of clarity in chain of title results from a 1995 decision by many lenders to rely on a third entity—often, a specific company, [[Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems]] (MERS)--to hold title nominally, in an effort to enable the buying and selling of mortgage liabilities without registration of changes of ownership with local governments.&lt;ref&gt;"Mortgage Electronic Registration System (MERS)."  Times Topics.

Harper's Magazine, January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  US states have objected and even sued over this practice.&lt;ref&gt;"Massachusetts attorney general sues big banks over foreclosure practices." Washington Post, 10 December 2011. https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/massachusetts-attorney-general-sues-big-banks-over-foreclosure-practices/2011/12/01/gIQAgwnUIO_story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chain of title for copyrights, trademarks, and rights of publicity ==

In the [[film|motion picture]] industry, the '''chain of title''' involves the series of documentation which establishes proprietary rights in a [[film]]. The chain also applies to compilations in other fields, where many people have contributed to the project, thus acquiring authorship rights, or where materials were culled from many sources. Chain of title is extremely important to film purchasers and to film distributors, as it establishes the veracity of the owner's proprietary rights (or rights under [[license]]) in the [[intellectual property]] in a film, book or encyclopedia.

Chain of title documentation can include:

* [[copyright]] clearances on [[music]] from the regional [[collecting society]], and to a less common extent, footage of other films;
* [[trademark]] clearances;
* [[artist|talent]] agreements, which should incorporate a [[legal release]] from the talent, be they [[actor]]s (including crowds), [[film director|director]]s, [[cinematographer]]s, [[choreographer]]s, or others, to use their works, images, likeness and other [[personality rights]] in the film;
* proof of errors and omission [[insurance]] (a special form of insurance for motion picture producers which covers omissions in obtaining adequate chain of title).

Specialist organizations engage in the production of copyright property reports for motion picture studios, which cover original or unexploited works, and include the results of [[United States Copyright Office]] screening searches, author claimant searches, registration renewal searches and assignment searches. This involves reviewing US Copyright Office records from 1870 to present and numerous trade publications and databases, and Library of Congress records.

[[Image:Christ_Pantocrator_mosaic_from_Hagia_Sophia_2744_x_2900_pixels_3.1_MB.jpg|thumb|Jesus Christ Pantocrator (Detail from the [[deesis]] [[mosaic]] in [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Istanbul]])]]

In [[Christian iconography]], '''Christ Pantocrator''' is a specific [[depiction of Jesus|depiction of Christ]].  ''Pantocrator'' or ''Pantokrator'' ({{lang-grc-gre|Χριστὸς Παντοκράτωρ}})&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pantokra/twr|παντοκράτωρ|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, used in this context, derived from of one of many [[Names of God in Judaism|names of God]] in Judaism.

When the [[Hebrew Bible]] was translated into Greek as the [[Septuagint]], ''Pantokrator'' was used both for ''YHWH Sabaoth'' "[[Lord of Hosts]]"&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/First and Second Books of Kings|2 Kings]] ([[Books of Samuel|2 Samuel]]) 7:8 and [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 3:13&lt;/ref&gt; and for ''[[El Shaddai]]'' "[[God Almighty]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Job|Job]] 5:17, 15:25 and 22:25&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[New Testament]], ''Pantokrator'' is used once by [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] ({{bibleverse|2|Cor|6:18|KJV}}) and nine times in the [[Book of Revelation]]: {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|1:8|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|4:8|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|11:17|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|15:3|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|16:7|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|16:14|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|19:6|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|19:15|KJV}}, and {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|21:22|KJV}}. The references to God and Christ in Revelation are at times interchangeable, ''Pantokrator'' appears to be reserved for God except, perhaps, in 1:8.

==Meaning==
[[File:Christ Pantokrator, Cathedral of Cefalù, Sicily.jpg|thumb|Christ Pantocrator mosaic in [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] from the [[Cefalù Cathedral]], [[Sicily]]]]
The most common translation of ''Pantocrator'' is "Almighty" or "All-powerful". In this understanding, ''Pantokrator'' is a compound word formed from the Greek words {{lang|grc|πᾶς}}, ''{{transl|grc|pas}}'' (&lt;small&gt;[[genitive|GEN]]&lt;/small&gt; {{lang|grc|παντός}} ''{{transl|grc|pantos}}''), i.e. "all"&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|pa{{=}}s1|πᾶς|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{lang|grc|κράτος}}, ''{{transl|grc|kratos}},'' i.e. "strength", "might", "power".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kra/tos1|κράτος|ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often understood in terms of potential power; i.e., ability to do anything, [[omnipotence]].

Another, more literal translation is "Ruler of All" or, less literally, "Sustainer of the World". In this understanding, Pantokrator is a compound word formed from the Greek for "all" and the verb meaning "To accomplish something" or "to sustain something" ({{lang|grc|κρατεῖν}}, ''{{transl|grc|kratein}}''). This translation speaks more to God's actual power; i.e., God does everything (as opposed to God can do everything).

The Pantokrator, largely an Eastern Orthodox or Eastern Catholic theological conception, is less common by that name in Western (Roman) Catholicism and largely unknown to most Protestants. In the West the equivalent image in art is known as [[Christ in Majesty]], which developed a rather different [[iconography]].

''Christ Pantocrator'' has come to suggest Christ as a mild but stern, all-powerful judge of humanity.

==Iconography==
[[File:Spas vsederzhitel sinay.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Christ Pantocrator (Sinai)|The oldest known icon of ''Christ Pantocrator'']], [[encaustic painting|encaustic on panel]] ([[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]). The two different facial expressions on either side may emphasize Christ's [[Hypostatic union|two natures]] as fully God and fully human.&lt;ref&gt;''God's Human Face: The Christ-Icon'' by Christoph Schoenborn (1994) {{ISBN|0-89870-514-2}} page 154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Sinai and the Monastery of St. Catherine'' by John Galey (1986) {{ISBN|977-424-118-5}} page 92&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The icon of Christ Pantokrator is one of the most common religious images of Orthodox Christianity. Generally speaking, in [[Byzantine art|Medieval eastern roman]] church art and architecture, an [[icon]]ic mosaic or fresco of Christ Pantokrator occupies the space in the central dome of the church, in the half-dome of the [[apse]], or on the [[nave]] vault. Some scholars (Latourette 1975: 572) consider the Pantocrator a Christian adaptation of images of Zeus, such as the great [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia|statue of Zeus enthroned at Olympia]]. The development of the earliest stages of the icon from Roman Imperial imagery is easier to trace.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Syndicus; ''Early Christian Art''; p. 96–99; Burns &amp; Oates, London, 1962. Hall pp. 78–80; James Hall, ''A History of Ideas and Images in Italian Art'', pp. 91–97, 1983, John Murray, London, {{ISBN|0-7195-3971-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The image of Christ Pantocrator was one of the first [[images of Jesus|images of Christ]] developed in the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian Church]] and remains a central icon of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. In the half-length image, Christ holds the [[New Testament]] in his left hand and makes the gesture of teaching or of [[blessing]] with his right. 
The typical Western [[Christ in Majesty]] is a full-length icon. In the early [[Middle Ages]], it usually presented Christ in a [[mandorla]] or other geometric frame, surrounded by the [[Four Evangelists]] or their symbols.

[[Christ Pantocrator (Sinai)|The oldest known surviving example]] of the icon of Christ Pantocrator was painted in [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] on panel in the sixth or seventh century, and survived the period of destruction of images during the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic disputes]] that twice racked the Eastern church, 726 to 787 and 814 to 842. It was preserved in [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], in the remote desert of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]].&lt;ref&gt;Manolis Chatzidakis and Gerry Walters, "An Encaustic Icon of Christ at Sinai", ''The Art Bulletin'' '''49'''.3 (September 1967) pp. 197–208.&lt;/ref&gt; The gessoed panel, finely painted using a wax medium on a wooden panel, had been coarsely overpainted around the face and hands at some time around the thirteenth century. When the overpainting was cleaned in 1962, the ancient image was revealed to be a very high-quality icon, probably produced in [[Constantinople]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The icon, traditionally half-length when in a [[semi-dome]],&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise the size of the figure would have to be greatly reduced to avoid the head appearing at the flattening top of the semi-dome.&lt;/ref&gt; which became adopted for panel icons also, depicts Christ fully frontal with a somewhat melancholy and stern aspect, with the right hand raised in blessing or, in the early encaustic panel at Saint Catherine's Monastery, the conventional rhetorical gesture that represents teaching. The left hand holds a closed book with a richly decorated cover featuring the [[Cross]], representing the [[Gospel]]s. An icon where Christ has an open book is called "Christ the Teacher", a variant of the Pantocrator. Christ is bearded, his brown hair centrally parted, and his head is surrounded by a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]. The icon is usually shown against a gold background comparable to the gilded grounds of mosaic depictions of the Christian emperors.

Often, the [[Christogram|name of Christ]] is written on each side of the halo, as [[ICXC|IC and XC]]. Christ's fingers are depicted in a pose that represents the letters IC, X and C, thereby making the [[Christogram]] ''ICXC'' (for "Jesus Christ"). The IC is composed of the Greek characters [[iota]] (Ι) and [[lunate sigma]] (C; instead of Σ, ς)—the first and last letters of 'Jesus' in Greek ({{lang|el|Ἰησοῦς}}); in XC the letters are [[Chi (letter)|chi]] (Χ) and again the lunate sigma—the first and last letters of 'Christ' in Greek ({{lang|el|Χριστός}}).

In many cases, Christ has a [[cruciform halo]] inscribed with the letters  Ο Ω Ν, i.e. {{lang|grc| ὁ ὢν}} [[I Am that I Am#Hellenistic Judaism|"He Who Is"]].

The '''chupacabra''' or '''chupacabras''' ({{IPA-es|tʃupaˈkaβɾas}}, literally "goat-sucker"; from ''chupar'', "to suck", and ''cabra'', "goat") is a [[legend]]ary creature in the [[folklore]] of parts of the Americas, with its first purported sightings reported in [[Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref name="Latino Bigfoot" /&gt; The name comes from the animal's reported [[Vampirism|habit]] of attacking and [[Hematophagy|drinking the blood]] of [[livestock]], including [[goat]]s.

Physical descriptions of the creature vary. It is purportedly a heavy creature, the size of a small bear, with a row of spines reaching from the neck to the base of the tail.

Eyewitness sightings have been claimed in Puerto Rico, and have since been reported as far north as [[Maine]], and as far south as [[Chile]], and even being spotted outside the Americas in countries like [[Russia]] and the [[Philippines]], but many of the reports have been disregarded as uncorroborated or lacking evidence. Sightings in northern Mexico and the southern United States have been verified as [[Canidae|canids]] afflicted by [[mange]].&lt;ref name="Radford2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |authorlink=Benjamin Radford |year=2011 |title=[[Tracking the Chupacabra]]: The Vampire Beast in Fact, Fiction and Folklore |isbn=978-0-8263-5015-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to biologists and wildlife management officials, the chupacabra is an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corp.primerahora.com/archivo.asp?guid=3283EF0636144DD6AAC744E6D18C3E66&amp;year=2002&amp;keyword= |title=Disfrazado el chupacabras |trans-title= |date=24 September 2002 |last=González Rodríguez |first=Miried |website=[[Primera Hora (Puerto Rico)|Primera Hora]] |location=Puerto Rico |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
''Chupacabras'' can be literally translated as "goat-sucker", from ''chupar'' ("to suck") and ''cabra'' ("goat"). It is known as both ''chupacabras'' and ''chupacabra'' throughout the Americas, with the former being the original word,&lt;ref name="Clave"&gt;Diccionario Clave, [http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&amp;cadena=chupacabras chupacabras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000326/http://clave.librosvivos.net/verficha.asp?idelementoaver=42243&amp;cadena=chupacabras |date=4 March 2016 }}. It states that both singular and plural is ''chupacabras''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter a [[regularization (linguistics)|regularization]] of it.  The name is attributed to Puerto Rican comedian [[Silverio Pérez]], who coined the label in 1995 while commenting on the attacks as a San Juan radio deejay.&lt;ref name="Pérez2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Pérez |first=Silverio |author-link=Silverio Pérez |title=Más humortivación: para el camino del éxito |trans-title=More Humortivation: The Path for Success |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG3wb8qOgt8C |year=2000 |publisher=Dreams Come True |isbn=978-0-9702011-0-2 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bradford2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/blogs/entry/was_the_nightjar_an_early_chupacabra/ |title=Was the Nightjar an Early Chupacabra? |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |author-link=Benjamin Radford |date=1 June 2017 |website=Center for Inquiry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reported attack eventually attributed to the creatures occurred in March 1995 in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name="trail"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm |title=On the trail of the Chupacabras |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |year=1998 |website=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050919215215/http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm |archive-date=19 September 2005 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight [[domestic sheep|sheep]] were discovered dead, each with three puncture wounds in the chest area and completely drained of blood.&lt;ref name="trail" /&gt; A few months later, in August, an eyewitness, Madelyne Tolentino, reported seeing the creature in the Puerto Rican town of [[Canóvanas, Puerto Rico|Canóvanas]], when as many as 150 farm animals and pets were reportedly killed.&lt;ref name="trail" /&gt; In 1975, similar killings in the small town of [[Moca, Puerto Rico|Moca]] were attributed to ''El Vampiro de Moca'' ("The Vampire of Moca").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm |title=Encounters with Chupacabras |year=2000 |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |website=[[About.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017163054/http://paranormal.about.com/cs/chupacabra/a/aa071403.htm |archive-date=17 October 2007 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, it was suspected that the killings were committed by a [[Satanism|Satanic]] [[cult]]; later more killings were reported around the island, and many farms reported loss of animal life. Each of the animals was reported to have had its body bled dry through a series of small circular incisions.

[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] comedian and entrepreneur [[Silverio Pérez]] is credited with coining the term ''chupacabras'' soon after the first incidents were reported in the press. Shortly after the first reported incidents in Puerto Rico, other animal deaths were reported in other countries, such as the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Argentina]], [[Bolivia]], Chile, [[Colombia]], [[Honduras]], [[El Salvador]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Panama]], [[Peru]], [[Brazil]], United States, and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name="trail" /&gt;

== Reputed origin ==
A five-year investigation by [[Benjamin Radford]], documented in his 2011 book ''[[Tracking the Chupacabra]]'', concluded that the description given by the original eyewitness in Puerto Rico, Madelyne Tolentino, was based on the creature Sil in the science-fiction horror film ''[[Species (film)|Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; The alien creature Sil is nearly identical to Tolentino’s chupacabra eyewitness account and she had seen the movie before her report: "It was a creature that looked like the chupacabra, with spines on its back and all... The resemblance to the chupacabra was really impressive," Tolentino reported.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales, Scott. Chupacabras: And Other Mysteries. {{ISBN|1-883729-06-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radford revealed that Tolentino "believed that the creatures and events she saw in ''Species'' were happening in reality in Puerto Rico at the time," and therefore concludes that "the most important chupacabra description cannot be trusted."&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; This, Radford believes, seriously undermines the credibility of the chupacabra as a real animal.&lt;ref&gt;Radford, Benjamin. "Slaying the Vampire: Solving the ''Chupacabra'' Mystery" ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', Vol. 35 No. 3, May/June 2011, Pages 45–48&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the reports of blood-sucking by the chupacabra were never confirmed by a [[necropsy]],&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; the only way to conclude that the animal was drained of blood. An analysis by a veterinarian of 300 reported victims of the chupacabra found that they had not been bled dry.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

Radford divided the chupacabra reports into two categories: the reports from [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Latin America]] where animals were attacked and it is supposed their blood was extracted, and the reports in the United States of [[mammal]]s, mostly dogs and [[coyote]]s with [[mange]], that people call "chupacabra" due to their unusual appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chupacabra Science: How Evolution Made a Mythical Monster |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/101028-chupacabra-evolution-halloween-science-monsters-chupacabras-picture/ |date=28 October 2010 |last=Than |first=Ker |work=National Geographic |publisher=National Geographic Society |accessdate=6 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2010, [[University of Michigan]] biologist Barry O'Connor concluded that all the chupacabra reports in the United States were simply coyotes infected with the parasite ''[[Sarcoptes scabiei]]'', whose symptoms would explain most of the features of the chupacabra: they would be left with little fur, thickened skin, and rank odor. O'Connor theorized that the attacks on goats occurred "because these animals are greatly weakened, they're going to have a hard time hunting. So they may be forced into attacking livestock because it's easier than running down a rabbit or a deer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ur.umich.edu/1011/Oct25_10/1698-scary-chupacabras-monster |date=25 October 2010 |title=Scary chupacabras monster is as much victim as villain |last=Ross-Flannigan |first=Nancy |website=The University Record |publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although several witnesses came to the conclusion that the attacks could not be the work of dogs or coyotes because they had not eaten the victim, this conclusion is incorrect.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt; Both dogs and coyotes can kill and not consume the prey, either because they are inexperienced, or due to injury or difficulty in killing the prey.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade and Bowns"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |title=Evaluation of Suspected Predator Kills |date=May 2010 |last1=Wade |first1=Dale A. |last2=Bowns |first2=James E. |website=Texas AgriLife Research and Extension Center | |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120101055717/http://texnat.tamu.edu/about/procedures-for-evaluating/evaluation-of-suspected-predator-kills/ |archivedate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prey can survive the attack and die afterwards from internal [[bleeding]] or [[circulatory shock]].&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wade and Bowns" /&gt; The presence of two holes in the neck, corresponding with the [[canine teeth]], are to be expected since this is the only way that most land [[carnivores]] have to catch their prey.&lt;ref name="Radford2011" /&gt;

There are reports of stray [[Mexican Hairless Dog]]s being mistaken for chupacabras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/offbeat/2009/09/01/roldan.chupacabra.KSAT?iref=videosearch |title=Breaking News Videos, Story Video and Show Clips – CNN.com |date=12 March 2014 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearance ==
The most common description of the chupacabra is that of a [[reptile]]-like creature, said to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://skepdic.com/chupa.html |title=Chupacabra |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |date=29 October 2015 |website=The Skeptic's Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said to be approximately {{convert|3|to|4|ft|1}} high, and stands and hops in a fashion similar to that of a [[kangaroo]].&lt;ref name="top ten"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/most-mysterious-creatures-of-modern-times-2594695 |title=The Top 10 Most Mysterious Creatures of Modern Times |last=Wagner |first=Stephen |date=8 September 2017 |website=ThoughtCo |publisher=[[Dotdash]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common description of the chupacabra is of a strange breed of wild dog. This form is mostly hairless and has a pronounced spinal ridge, unusually pronounced eye sockets, fangs, and claws. Unlike conventional predators, the chupacabra is said to drain all of the animal's blood (and sometimes organs) usually through three holes in the shape of a downwards-pointing triangle or through one or two holes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285 |last=De Jesús Mangual |first=Tomás |author-link=Tomás de Jesús Mangual |date=9 January 2006 |title=Imputan otro ataque al Chupacabras |website=[[El Vocero]] |location=San Juan, Puerto Rico |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011110443/http://vocero.com/noticias.asp?s=Locales&amp;n=23285 |archive-date=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related legends ==
A popular legend in [[New Orleans]] concerns a popular lovers' lane called Grunch Road, which was said to be inhabited by "grunches", creatures similar in appearance to the ''Chupacabra''.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

The [[peuchen]]s of Chile also share similarities in their supposed habits, but instead of being dog-like they are described as winged snakes. This legend may have originated from the [[vampire bat]], an animal endemic to the region.&lt;ref name=peuchen1&gt;[https://archive.is/20070619191305/http://www.diarioelcentro.cl/articulos_sc.php?fecha=26-07-2004&amp;semana=29-2004 Article: Tras los pasos del chupacabras. El centro, Journal. 26-07-2004 {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Philippines, another [[legendary creature]] called the [[Sigbin]] shares many of chupacabra's descriptions.

The popularity of the chupacabra has resulted in its being featured in many types of media.
* At least one published mystery novel uses aspects of the myth as the centerpoint of the plot.&lt;ref name="Wagner2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wagner |first=Lloyd |title=El Chupacabras: Trail of the Goatsucker |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ejeE4_e_mQQC |date=October 2004 |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=978-0-595-33315-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other kinds of books include those that provide a scientific explanation for the phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Corrales, Scott.

A '''conjectural portrait''' is a [[portrait]] made of a historical figure for whom no authentic contemporary portrait is available.  The depiction, then, may be variously informed by [[primary source|written accounts]] of [[Human physical appearance|physical appearance]], conjecture based on the subject's culture and background, and/or the artist's conception of the subject's [[Moral character|inner essence]].

==Iconic portraits==
Certain conjectural portraits have become [[iconography|iconic]] of their subjects, and are widely recognizable as such, with few being aware that they are not authentic portraits.  For example, portraits of [[Christopher Columbus]] and [[Joan of Arc]] are widely recognized.

The '''Contemporary Art Museum of Macedonia''' ([[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]: Музеј на современата уметност) is one of the largest and most complete national institution of the [[Republic of Macedonia]]. Located in the capital city of [[Skopje]], the museum was founded in 1963 following the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|disastrous earthquake that hit the city]]. The building project was donated by the [[Polish Government]].

==Collection==
The collection is made up of two segments; international and national. The international segment of the collections reflects the modern art from almost all parts of the world. The larger part of the collection marks the art movements of the 1950s, 1960's and 1970s, although it contains also around a hundred works of the early modern art. The older exhibits are mainly highlighted by works of [[Emil Filla]], [[Fernand Léger]], and [[André Masson]]. The works of the internationally well-known artists are of special importance, such as [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Hans Hartung]], [[Victor Vasarely]], [[Alexander Calder]], [[Pierre Soulages]], [[Alberto Burri]], [[Christo]], [[Robert Jacobsen]], [[Etienne Hajdu]], [[Zoltan Kemeny]], [[Robert Adams (sculptor and designer)|Robert Adams]], [[Emilio Vedova]], [[Antoni Clavé]], and [[Georg Baselitz]].&lt;ref name="collection"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msu.mk/international/|title=International Collection|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art - Skopje, Macedonia|accessdate=13 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{confused|Dan Parks}}
'''Dan Park''' (born May 4, 1968)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Birth data from Ratsit.se | url = http://www.ratsit.se/19680504-Dan_Fredrik_Park_Limhamn/ph-02o_-HdApJMgEYq_agD6UsZabOtLv6Y4ZEYM2q8M}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Swedish [[street artist]] who has been arrested, fined, and sentenced to jail for [[Hate speech#Sweden|hate speech]] in Swedish Courts several times for his art.

In 2011, Park was arrested for a collage poster depicting an Afro-Swede &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Swedish artist jailed for 'race hate'  | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20140821/swedish-artist-jailed-for-race-hate-pictures | work=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; student activist naked and in chains along with text saying "Our negro slave has run away", and the activist's personal contact information. Park singled out the student activist for reporting a student party with people in blackface. Park was convicted of defamation and racial agitation, and given a suspended sentence, fined, and ordered to pay damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Artist avoids jail for 'negro slave taunt' | url = http://www.thelocal.se/20120127/38756 | work=[[The Local]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Park was arrested at the opening of an exhibition of his collage posters, and was sentenced to 6 months in jail for incitement to racial agitation and defamation, and ordered to pay a total of 60,000 kronor ($8,700) in damages to four people depicted in his pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20140821/swedish-artist-jailed-for-race-hate-pictures |title=Swedish artist jailed for 'race hate' pictures |work=[[The Local]] |date=2014-08-21 |accessdate=2014-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the court ordered 9 of his works destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sentenced: Swedish Artist Dan Park "Incited Against an Ethnic Group" | url = http://hyperallergic.com/154676/sentenced-swedish-artist-dan-park-incited-against-an-ethnic-group/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Park himself insists that his works are not racist, but a satiric commentary on current events and against [[political correctness]] in Sweden. Park is mainly notable for the intense public debate about [[freedom of speech]] that his case and works have generated, especially in Denmark, where his works have been exhibited in the Parliament building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dan Parks forbudte billeder vises på Christiansborg i dag | publisher=Politiken | url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/kunst/ECE2432649/dan-parks-forbudte-billeder-vises-paa-christiansborg-i-dag/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5751">'''Delaine Le Bas''' (born 1965) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] Artist from a [[Romani people|Romany]] background.

==Biography==
Le Bas told the Travellers' Times that “I actually liked going to school which was difficult because I am the only one out of five of us that finished school. And then I had ideas about going to Art College.” She said that until starting school she had been sheltered from how racist people can be towards Gypsy Traveller people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://travellerstimes.org.uk/Blogs--Features/Delaine-Le-Bas--a-strange-and-interesting-journe.aspx|title=Delaine Le Bas – ‘a strange and interesting journey’|website=travellerstimes.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Delaine Le Bas has shown her art extensively both in the UK and internationally, including at the International Festival of Singular Art, [[Roquevaire]], [[France]]; the [[American Visionary Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore]], [[United States|U.S.]], [[Transition Gallery]] and the 2005 and 2007 [[Prague]] Biennales. In June 2007 her work was included in the first [[Romani people|Roma]] pavilion of the 2007 [[Venice Biennale]]. She took part in the Summer 2007 [[Prague Biennale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.praguebiennale.org/3/eng/|title=PRAGUEBIENNALE3|accessdate=4 August 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404063523/http://www.praguebiennale.org/3/eng/|archivedate=4 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Bas will participate in ROUNDTABLE: The 9th [[Gwangju Biennale]], which took place September 7 – November 11, 2012 in Gwangju, Korea.

Le Bas has had several solo exhibitions, including "Room" at [[Transition Gallery]] in London; "The House of the JuJu Queen" at Galerie Giti Nourbaksch, Berlin, and at Galleria Sonia Rosso, Turin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.formerwest.org/Contributors/DelaineLeBas|title=FORMER WEST – Delaine Le Bas|website=www.formerwest.org|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work has been called 'magpie-like', featuring intricate embroidery and installations made up of various objects and ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2008/02/10/delaine-le-bas/|title=Delaine Le Bas – Wonderland|date=2008-02-10|work=Wonderland|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her work moves expansively from a unique series of thematic departures including nationhood, race, gender and relationships. These issues are explored through freely combined media. Embroidery, painting and decoupage/"femmage" interact with sculpture and installations that reflect domestic claustrophobia, the transient nature of modern materiality and the tensions that characterise Le Bas' own experience as a [[Romani people|Gypsy]]. The boundary between embellished objects and recovered items re-deposited within the installation is deliberately tested and blurred. Tapestries adorned with the Artist's own stitching and brushmarks arte confronted by items with a less unequivocal history.

In the publicity for the First Roma Pavilion at Venice in 2007, Le Bas was quoted as saying: "As a Romany, my viewpoint has always been that of the outsider and this position of the 'other' is reflected in the materials and messages within my work. We live in a culture of mixed values and garbled messages. My works are crafted from the disregarded and disparate objects of the car boot sale and the charity shop."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.docstoc.com/docs/11381760/Paradise-Lost-Quotes|title=Paradise Lost / Il Paradiso Perduto|publisher=RomaPavilion.org|accessdate=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For an installation in 2014, Le Bas recreated 'containment compounds' used to control Gypsy families by British authorities at the start of the 20th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/art/art477909-Romany-Gypsy-Delain-Le-Bas-recreate-containment-compounds-gallery-exhibition|title=Romany Gypsy Delaine Le Bas to recreate containment compounds in gallery exhibition {{!}} Culture24|website=www.culture24.org.uk|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 she told The Guardian that “Most Roma art is held in storage, gathering dust in basements of museums... Most artists are either ignored altogether or, as Gypsies, we’re visible only in a highly negative way.”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/08/roma-artists-launch-art-cultural-centre-institute-berlin|title='A place to call our own': Europe's first Roma cultural centre opens in Berlin|last=Connolly|first=Kate|date=2017-06-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Bas and her husband [[Damian Le Bas]] have been associated with [[Outsider Art]], unconventional artists working outside the confines of the art establishment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Ensemble librarianship''' (or performance librarianship) is an area of [[music librarianship]] which specializes in serving the needs of [[musical ensemble]]s, including [[symphony]] and chamber [[orchestra]]s, [[opera house]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[ballet]] companies, wind ensembles and educational institutions. Ensemble librarians acquire printed music and prepare it for performance.

== History ==

Ensemble or performance librarianship is a relatively new and evolving field with an oral history, so in many instances, there is no written history upon which to rely. Aside from a few surveys and recorded interviews, there are very few documents describing the history of the profession at this point in time. Many of the musicians who developed and defined the job as it exists today are still living (for example, librarian [https://web.archive.org/web/20111002083408/http://www.polyphonic.org/contributor.php?id=80 Clinton Nieweg]). Historically, music librarians were only required to handle acquisitions and distribution – they did not have the requirements many librarians have today to mark individual parts for performance, correct errors, work in close consultation with the music director and/or artistic staff, and conduct scholarly research. Traditionally, many orchestra librarians were string players, since they already possessed a working knowledge of [[Bow (music)|bowings]] (markings made in string parts). “Until 1970s, in all but the largest orchestras the librarian had a playing position in the orchestra and engaged in part time library work to supplement his or her income.  In other cases the librarian had retired from playing and still wished to remain a part of the orchestra.  A survey at the 1998 MOLA annual conference (conducted by Andrew S. Holmes) revealed that in some smaller orchestras..., the library position had remained part-time for the most part until the mid 1980's to early 1990's.”&lt;ref name="mola-inc"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Holmes |first=Andrew S. |title=Classification of the Performance Librarian within the Orchestra: A Thesis in Music |date=May 1998 |chapter=The History of the Performance Librarian |page=34 |url=http://www.mola-inc.org/PressRoom/HolmesThesis.pdf |accessdate=21 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724225057/http://www.mola-inc.org/PressRoom/HolmesThesis.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some organizations, librarian duties were alternatively fulfilled by an administrative staff member (i.e. personnel manager or orchestra manager) and this is still the case with many smaller organizations today. Gradually, particularly with the larger orchestras and bands, the role of music librarian has become a job obtained on an audition basis and which requires the demonstration of extensive knowledge of not only music notation, history, and performance practice, but also specialized technique and research ability. Today, larger and more established organizations can have multiple librarians and a hierarchy has developed, where a principal librarian is often identified and compensated accordingly (much like principal string or wind/brass/percussion players in an orchestral setting). This principal librarian may then work with one or more assistant librarians and can delegate tasks.&lt;ref name="mola-inc" /&gt;

== Education ==

=== Formal education ===

A professional ensemble librarian requires a diverse and extensive musical, research, and often administrative-oriented background. Currently, there is no formal degree program specifically for ensemble or performance librarianship offered at any academic institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, primary forms of training include degree programs or their equivalent in Music Performance (instrumental), Music Theory, Musicology, or related fields, in conjunction with mentoring, internships, and on-the-job training. In the United States, work as an apprentice with a career librarian is a common and invaluable educational tool.&lt;ref name="polyphonic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schnackenberg|first=Karen|title=Training to Become a Performance Librarian|url=http://www.polyphonic.org/article.php?id=131|accessdate=6 May 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002083433/http://www.polyphonic.org/article.php?id=131|archivedate=2 October 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ensemble librarians hold degrees in Library Science (LIS, MLIS). "Most music schools and many library / information science schools have programs that offer a variety of related course work which could be applied to orchestra librarianship.”&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro"&gt;{{cite web|last=Major Orchestra Librarians' Association|title=The Orchestra Librarian: A Career Introduction|url=http://www.mola-inc.org/orchlib.html|accessdate=21 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While such experience can be very helpful, this is not typically a specific requirement to work as an ensemble librarian. Ideally, “training for orchestra librarianship should include a broad and intensive education in all aspects of music and the liberal arts. This career requires a combination of formal education and extensive practical experience in a symphonic organization."&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

=== Required skills and abilities ===
&lt;big&gt;Qualifications&lt;/big&gt;&lt;br /&gt; (Quoted with permission from Russ Girsberger's "A Manual for the Performance Library"&lt;ref name="Girsberger2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance&lt;br /&gt; Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
The following list describes the qualifications that are desirable to function successfully as a performance librarian. Not every position requires all of these abilities, but professional performance librarians use these skills on a regular basis in their work.

* Educational and Musical Qualifications
-	Degree in music or equivalent musical knowledge&lt;br /&gt;
-	Experience as a performing musician, preferably as a member of a large ensemble&lt;br /&gt;

-	Self-motivated&lt;ref name="Girsberger2006" /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;Library Auditions&lt;/big&gt;

In the U.S., some professional ensemble librarians must now endure a process similar to instrumental orchestral auditions in order to obtain their jobs. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110413173239/http://www.kennedy-center.org/nso/orchestra/meet_musicians/?mode=administration Marcia Farabee (Principal Librarian, National Symphony]) explains that today some orchestras have adopted a similar audition process for librarians. These 'librarian auditions' involve interviews as well as written tests which ask questions to which a qualified candidate should know the answers."&lt;ref name="mola-inc" /&gt; Experience, formal education, and references provided on the auditionee's résumé play an important role, but the candidate may be required to pass this live audition and interview component, as well. As noted, larger orchestras and the more prestigious summer fellowships may require a candidate to pass a written exam demonstrating knowledge of composers, important historical facts, publishers, and repertoire. Librarians wishing to pursue this career study long hours in order to prepare for these auditions and therefore, professional ensemble librarianship is becoming a competitive field in North America. In Europe, many ensemble librarians currently obtain their positions via a more standard job interview process.

== Functions of the performance librarian ==

=== Music acquisition and cataloging ===

The ensemble librarian is often the primary individual responsible for research, acquisition (via purchase, rental, commission, or lending), receipt of materials, and cataloging of performing materials (scores and parts) for a musical organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Music Library Association|title=Music Librarianship: Is it for you?|year=2009|url=http://musiclibraryassoc.org/employment.aspx?id=78|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The librarian consults and collaborates with the music director, other artistic or administrative staff members, and/or soloists to identify the correct edition or version of the work to be acquired and its source, then works to determine its cost, delivery time, method of delivery, and any other associated concerns. The librarian may also be responsible for locating and obtaining perusal materials (scores and/or recordings for study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important component of the acquisition process, particularly in the case of renting works under copyright, can be obtaining permission and licensing for any recording, broadcast (radio or World Wide Web), or other types of mechanical use that may be planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Tarlow, L.  |author2=Sutherland, R.|title=The Music We Perform: An overview of royalties, rentals, and rights|year=2004 |orig-year=1998 |page=6|url=http://www.mola-inc.org|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the purchase or commission of performance materials, the librarian may be obligated to create and/or maintain a catalog of the musical organization’s physical holdings of performance and reference material. This can be as simple as an itemized listing of materials owned or as complex as designing and implementing a custom-made electronic catalog for the ensemble. Many organizations utilize pre-existing database programs such as [http://fineartssoftware.com OPAS]. Upon receipt of purchased or donated materials, the librarian inventories the scores and parts, stamps or otherwise marks them with the organization’s name and identifying information, and prepares them for storage. Cataloging can also extend to maintaining a record of conductor markings and dates of use, condition of materials, and performance and lending history.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

=== Part preparation and distribution ===

The most essential task of the ensemble librarian is to provide adequately prepared [[Part (music)|parts]] to the players of the ensemble. Collaboration with conductors and soloists is often necessary in order to determine the specific requirements concerning the part preparation process. The goal is to ensure smooth flow of rehearsals and performances.
Music arriving from a [[Publishing|publisher]] or rental agent is rarely ready for use as such; most parts will need adjustments to make them more suitable for the performer. This most frequently includes marking string bowings, fixing bad page turns, adding and/or coordinating rehearsal figures, clarifying illegible notation and correcting [[Erratum|errata]]. Editing of [[tempo]]s, [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[Articulation (music)|articulations]], inserts, and cuts or transposition into a singer's preferred [[Range (music)|vocal range]] or instrumentalist's preferred [[Key (music)|key]] may also be required. Additional [[proofreading]] may also be necessary, due to mistakes or inconsistencies in published editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the parts have been prepared appropriately, the orchestra librarian will assemble concert folders or arrange part pick-up for the musicians. The concert folder contains all the music for the complete [[concert]] for an individual musician (e.g. [[Oboe]] I) or a single desk of musicians (such as [[Violin]] I / Desk 1).  Assembling the concert folders needs to be finished well in advance of each series of performances to make sure the musicians have time to practice. In some orchestras, the librarian is responsible for delivering concert folders to the music stands on stage for all rehearsals and performances.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

Once the performances are over, the librarian disassembles the concert folders, tracks down any missing parts and stores any performance materials owned by the orchestra. Hired or rented sets are returned, and archival copies of bowings are usually made for future reference.

=== Preservation ===
The ensemble librarian is responsible for the care and [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of the ensemble's music collection. In addition to the purchase cost of printed [[sheet music]], the value of the library collection increases with information added during rehearsals and preparation work done to the parts. This value is inherent and often irreplaceable.

Damage to printed music may occur due to environmental sources (sunlight, temperature, humidity, pests, dust), physical handling, and improper storage. Appropriate humidity and temperature, protection from light sources (especially ultraviolet light) and from acid materials are key factors in ensuring the long life of printed music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A manual for the performance library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=113–114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Auditions ===
One common recruitment process of musicians for professional orchestras and bands is an audition and the ensemble's librarian is often responsible for preparing the materials required for such auditions. These usually include a round consisting of excerpts from standard orchestral repertoire that the auditionee is required to perform for the audition committee. The orchestra librarian is usually in charge of preparing the audition materials for the auditionees and audition committee. Care must be taken that starts, stops, [[Key signature|key]] and [[time signature]]s, [[Tempo|tempo markings]] and transpositions are properly indicated. The librarian is often responsible for acquiring publishers' permissions for reproducing the audition excerpts of works still under [copyright].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A manual for the performance library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods and tools ===
In the area of [[research]], [[cataloging]], storage and [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] of music, [[Music library|music libraries]] share many methods in common with ensemble libraries.&lt;ref name="polyphonic" /&gt;   Many ensemble librarians use a comprehensive computerized [[database]] such as [http://fineartssoftware.com OPAS] that integrates information about the [[composer]], [[Instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], and performance history of standard orchestral works.

Use of the internet has provided librarians easier access to information, especially research and reference materials. The online forum of the [http://www.mola-inc.org Major Orchestra Librarians' Association (MOLA)] has greatly increased communication between professional librarians and provided excellent opportunities for networking and exchange of information.&lt;ref name="mola-inc" /&gt;

The tools traditionally used for the part preparation process are very elementary: writing utensils (pencils of various graphite hardness, colored pencils, ink pens, felt tipped pens, electric and manual erasers, correction fluid and tape), office supplies (pencil sharpeners, staplers, staple removers, scissors, rulers, drafting templates, straight-edges, non-yellowing permanent and removable adhesive tapes, paper clips, packing tape, shipping materials, and property stamps). Typical office equipment found in an ensemble library includes a high quality photocopier capable of copying and printing paper of various sizes in duplex; papers of different sizes, colors and weights; binding machines (tape, coil, wire or comb); paper cutters; and computer(s) with word processing, spreadsheet, database and music notation software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherrill|first=Steven|title=Symphony Orchestra Library|url=http://www.orchestralibrary.com/|accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The part preparation process is traditionally done by hand for every single part to be used on stage. Bowings need to be marked into the string parts using pencil, since they are likely to change on stage during rehearsals, and the players need to be able to incorporate the alterations easily. The same applies to conductors' personal tempo indications and dynamic markings. Temporary musical edits (such as cuts and inserts) are done in a way which allows their easy removal afterward.

In addition to common library tools, ensemble librarians often utilize music engraving software for incorporating last-minute musical changes such as transpositions, "concert" endings, inserts or other musical edits to the performance material at hand.

On occasion, digital image processing software (such as Adobe [[Photoshop]]) is used for correcting errata and enhancing print quality of problematic performance materials of public domain musical works. Use of digital technology is becoming common in the task of preparing audition excerpts for the musician recruitment process.,&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A Manual for the Performance Library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|pages=138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative duties ===
In addition to the artistic roles ensemble librarians play within their organizations, many also manage duties that are administrative in nature. The administrative duties of an ensemble librarian differ depending on the type of musical organization for which the librarian works. The ensemble librarian's administrative tasks can range from control of the receipt and delivery of the performance materials to managing invoices and payments and creating an annual budget for the library; support for the program planning on issues related to [[instrumentation (music)]], off-stage music, different versions or editions, correct instrumentation. . .; providing assistance and support to the conductors, musicians, singers, [[choir]], soloists and all professionals involved in concert production; managing the lending of musical materials to other institutions; providing additional notes or information for the printed concert program; coordinating the obtaining of rights for [[performance]], recording or [[broadcast]].&lt;ref name="mola-inc" /&gt;

== Areas of practice ==

=== Symphony and chamber orchestras ===
Many ensemble librarians work in the field of [[Symphony orchestra|symphony]] and [[chamber orchestra]]s, forming the most typical professional profile of a performance librarian. Performance librarianship in professional symphony and chamber orchestras is characterized by frequently changing programs and a large total number of works performed, reflecting in the large number of performance materials and sets of parts to be prepared. Many full-time, professional, North American symphony orchestras employ two or even three music librarians (typically, a principal librarian and one or more assistant librarians). In Europe, full-sized symphony orchestras operate with fewer resources. For example, The [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra]], and the [[Tampere Philharmonic Orchestra]] all are single-librarian orchestras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Major Orchestra Librarians' Association|title=MOLA Member Organizations and Librarians|url=http://www.mola-inc.org/cgi-bin/moladb/membershiplistnew.cgi|accessdate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The symphony orchestra librarian is in frequent contact with conductors and soloists to coordinate the editions and versions of works to be used, possible alterations or edits required, and their appropriate implementation. These can include cuts, inserts, supplemental rehearsal markings, transpositions and doublings. The librarian may also be involved in providing information to the orchestra administration for program planning purposes, such as information on the duration and instrumentation of the works in question, and any rental or purchase costs. This is essential information for the symphony orchestra repertoire planning process and the librarian can play an integral role.

=== Opera ===
The complexity of opera [[librarianship]] is due to the diversity and quantity of performance materials required (such as vocal scores, chorus scores, full scores, orchestral parts, off-stage parts), plus the sheer duration of operatic works makes the job a challenge. [[Opera]] productions are often subject to revision; occasionally sections of the music are skipped ("cuts" are made) or otherwise altered, and some excerpts may be [[transposition (music)|transposed]] to a different key to accommodate the vocal range of the soloists. Several [[opera]]s have different musical versions: different historical versions, versions sung in different languages or recent revisions made in [[Historical editions (music)|editions]] of the work. [[Translation]]s and [[transliteration]]s may have to be inserted into the vocal scores, and most often this is organized by the librarian. In addition, as [[opera]] is a scenic art form, some musical considerations can develop due to the [[stage direction]]. Consequently, the [[librarian]] is in charge of implementing the necessary edits into the performance material provided by the opera library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Opera: Friend or Foe|year=2011 (2009)|publisher=Major Orchestra Librarians' Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ballet ===
Music in [[ballet]] is often subject to extensive revision, re-ordering and adaptation by the [[choreographer]]. This creates additional and varied duties for the ballet librarian, as opposed to the symphony or opera librarian. The [[choreography]] often requires cuts and sequence changes to the music, and therefore the librarian must be able to make the cuts logical and smooth in a musical sense. Knowledge of standard ballet repertoire and major ballet choreographers is necessary, since there are often several adaptations and arrangements of these works available.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

=== Bands ===
The [[concert band]] or wind ensemble librarian's duties greatly resemble those of an orchestral performance librarian, but certain variations exist. For example, bands do not include the string sections for which orchestral librarians mark bowings into individual parts. A few examples of bands that might employ librarians are [[military band]]s, wind ensembles, [[brass bands]], [[marching band]]s, [[jazz band]]s, ensembles at educational institutions, and popular music groups. The band librarian's work is greatly dependent on the performance venues and number of performances of the band - some military bands may perform in several ceremonies each day, and often a vast body of music must be ready to go on short notice. Marching, military, or brass bands may also perform in parades. In addition, many bands perform concerts on tour.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;

=== Educational institutions ===
Many top-level music schools and conservatories employ either professional and/or student ensemble librarians. Professionals often hold staff positions with the institution and job titles can range from “Music Librarian” to “Band Department Administrative Assistant” or “Orchestra Manager.” In addition to performance librarian duties on par with professional organizations, educational institution positions often entail extensive administrative duties for the music department and personnel manager tasks, as well. Librarians in the university setting can oversee not only orchestras, bands, and choirs, but also wind or brass repertoire, conducting, and master classes; placement auditions; chamber music ensembles and more.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro"/&gt;

The work of an academic librarian can vary from that of a professional ensemble's librarian in many ways. For example, university ensembles tend to employ part rotation for educational purposes, whereas professional groups more often have one designated player per part or string seating position. Consequently, librarians at educational institutions must develop different types of part distribution systems than may be used at the professional level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girsberger|first=Russ|title=A manual for the performance library|year=2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md.|isbn=978-0-8108-5871-8|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the academic librarian may be obligated to coordinate greater circulation of materials to faculty, rotating and guest conductors, student recitals, and community organizations. This can present additional work to mark and re-mark parts each time they are to be used by the primary ensemble.&lt;ref name="MOLA career intro" /&gt;  Educational institutions may also provide significantly more practice parts and allow the check-out of parts much earlier by students in order to provide ample practice time, whereas professional musicians may not require this provision for as many of the scheduled works.

=== Music festivals ===
An alternative career or summer opportunity for the ensemble librarian is to work for a music festival, either professional or educational. Such positions are often part-time or seasonal and can afford the ensemble librarian with experience preparing different types of repertoire and working with different types of musicians. Various organizations compile and maintain listings of current classical music festivals, including professional music organizations such as [http://www.americanorchestras.org/ The League of American Orchestras]' publication “[http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/symphonyonline/may_jun_2010/#/48 Symphony],” university music departments like [http://precollege.juilliard.edu/pages/festivals_competitions.htm#festivals The Juilliard School], and student organizations such as [[Sigma Alpha Iota]]. [http://www.mola-inc.org MOLA] maintains a listing of summer festival job openings, which is available in PDF format under the “Job Openings” tab.

== Professional organizations ==
For various reasons (such as the limited number of professionals in a particular geographical area, the dynamic scenario of working for a performing arts organization, and the lack of a formal academic degree program in the field), cooperation among professional ensemble librarians is not only helpful, but essential. International and national organizations facilitate the collaboration among ensemble library professionals and offer further opportunities for professional development and training.

The most notable organizations for ensemble librarians are as follows:

[http://www.mola-inc.org Major Orchestra Librarians’ Association] (MOLA): The Major Orchestra Librarians' Association, founded in 1983, is composed of nearly 250 professional performance organizations around the world, represented by more than 400 librarians. MOLA facilitates communication between professional performance librarians, educates and assists them in providing service to their organizations, provides support and resources to the performing arts, and works with publishers to achieve the highest standards in music performance materials for the professional musician. Today, MOLA's membership includes symphony orchestras, opera and ballet companies, music academies, professional bands and other types of ensembles worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Major Orchestra Librarians' Association|title=Home page|url=http://www.mola-inc.org/|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.iaml.info International Association of Music Libraries] (IAML): Founded in 1951, the International Association of Music Libraries, Archives and Documentation Centres has ca. 2,000 individual and institutional members in ca. 45 countries. IAML works to promote international cooperation and to support the interests of the profession. It has national branches in 22 countries, five professional branches, four subject commissions and various working groups, and is responsible for several large-scale documentation projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaml.info/what-iaml|title=What is IAML?|last=International Association of Music Libraries|first=|date=27 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the professional ensemble librarian, the [http://www.iaml.info/organization/branches/broadcasting_and_orchestra_libraries#activities Broadcasting and Orchestra Libraries Branch] is the most essential of IAML's professional branches.

== Current issues ==
An ongoing issue in discussion among ensemble or performance librarians is the adequacy of available performance materials, in comparison to today's needs and standards required for professional use. Therefore, challenges arise, such as the deterioration of materials only available on a rental basis, the need to meet the recommended requirements for editing music in terms of format, size, page turns, etc.; the problem of [[erratum|errata]] present in many editions; the delivery of materials in digital format (common in the case of direct distribution from composers to the user), from which the librarian must then create physical parts for performance; the quality of service provided by [[Music publisher (popular music)|music publishers]] and the accessibility of the information they provide; the emergence of [http://www.estand.com/info/ digital music stands] and the associated changes such media may bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schnackenberg|first=Karen|title=Send REAL Parts, please!!|url=http://kschnack.wordpress.com/2009/08/09/send-real-parts-please/|work=From the Orchestra Library|accessdate=13 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the typical concerns professional ensemble librarians face, another major issue is ensuring compliance with [[copyright]] laws. With the constant evolution of new technology, streaming performances on the Internet and other digital use of recorded music have become reality, and new forms of copyright-related questions therefore arise. For example, the performed work may be in the [[public domain]] where the orchestra originates, but may still be under copyright in some of the geographical areas where, for instance, a webcast may be accessible. The modern ensemble librarian is charged with the duty to self-educate regarding these new technological advances, in order to avoid violation of copyright law and to protect the organization for which they work.

'''''Young Girls at the Piano''''' (French: '''Jeunes filles au piano''') is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], a leading painter in the development of the [[Impressionist]] style. The painting was completed in 1892 as an informal commission for the [[Musée du Luxembourg]]. Renoir painted three other variations of this composition in oil and two sketches, one in oil and one in pastel. Known by the artist as repetitions, they were executed to fulfill commissions from dealers and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Museum of Art By Gary Tinterow, {{ISBN|0-8709-9457-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is on public display at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York, and the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] in Paris.

==Description==
Renoir depicts two young girls at a piano in a [[bourgeois]] home, one in a white dress with blue sash seated playing and one in a pink dress standing. Renoir completed three additional versions of this composition in oil for collectors; the Luxembourg version is now housed at the [[Musée d'Orsay]] in Paris,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musee-orsay.fr/index.php?id=851&amp;L=1&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5BshowUid%5D=17865 Jeunes filles au piano at the Musée d'Orsay]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Robert Lehman Collection]] version is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/150000160 Two Young Girls at the Piano at the Met]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Caillebotte version and one other are in private collections. An oil sketch of the composition is on display at the [[Musée de l'Orangerie]] in Paris and a pastel sketch is in a private collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/young-girls-at-the-piano/ZAGwT97hbG0-sg?projectId=art-project&amp;hl=en Young Girls at the Piano at Google Cultural Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; The painting in the Musée d'Orsay is 116&amp;nbsp;cm high and 90&amp;nbsp;cm wide. The version at the Met is 111.8 x 86.4&amp;nbsp;cm. The oil sketch at the Musée de l'Orangerie is 116.0 x 81.0&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/orangerie/renoirimage.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pissarro]] and [[Monet]] routinely painted series of variations on a single theme, but their works were intended to be shown together to chronicle the effects of light and atmosphere, while Renoir’s repetitions were independent essays in [[composition (visual arts)|composition]].&lt;ref&gt;Nineteenth and Twentieth-century Paintings By Richard Robson Brettell, Paul Hayes Tucker, {{ISBN|1-5883-9349-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, details and poses changed subtly, and the sketches eliminate most of the background elements.

Renoir explored a similar composition with his earlier 1888 work ''[[The Daughters of Catulle Mendès]]'', now in the Annenberg Collection at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/110002470 The Daughters of Catulle Mendès at the Met]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2010}}

A '''goldsmith''' is a [[Metalworking|metalworker]] who specializes in working with [[gold]] and other [[precious metal]]s. Historically, goldsmiths also have made [[cutlery|silverware]], [[platter (dishware)|platter]]s, [[goblet]]s, decorative and serviceable utensils, [[ceremonial]] or [[religious]] items, and rarely using [[Kintsugi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/02/AR2009030202723.html|title=Kintsugi|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the rising prices of precious metals have curtailed the making of such items to a large degree.

Goldsmiths must be skilled in forming metal through [[file (tool)|filing]], [[brazing|soldering]], [[saw]]ing, [[forging]], [[Casting (metalworking)|casting]], and [[polishing]] metal. The trade has very often included [[jewellery]]-making skills, as well as the very similar skills of the [[silversmith]]. Traditionally, these skills had been passed along through [[apprenticeship]]s, however, more recently jewellery arts schools specializing solely in teaching goldsmithing and a multitude of skills falling under the jewellery arts umbrella are available. Many universities and junior colleges also offer goldsmithing, silversmithing, and metal arts fabrication as a part of their fine arts curriculum.

[[File:Goldworker in Baghdad.jpg|thumb|300px|[[The Baqdadi goldsmith]] by [[Kamal-ol-molk]]]]

At least in Europe, goldsmiths increasingly performed many of the functions we now regard as part of [[banking]], especially providing custody of valuable items and currency exchange, though they were usually restrained from lending at interest, which was regarded as [[usury]].

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Goudsmid Pa Soerau naast zijn gereedschap Karolanden TMnr 10014305.jpg|thumb|Karo goldsmith and his tools]]
Compared to other metals, gold is [[malleable]], [[ductile]], rare, and it is the only solid metallic [[Chemical element|element]] with a [[yellow]] [[color]]. It may easily be melted, fused, and cast without the problems of oxides and gas that are problematic with other metals such as [[bronze]]s, for example. It is fairly easy to "pressure weld", wherein similarly to clay two small pieces may be pounded together to make one larger piece. Gold is classified as a [[noble metal]]&amp;mdash;because it does not react with most elements. It usually is found in its [[native metal|native]] form, lasting indefinitely without oxidization and tarnishing.

==History==
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0007208 Ständebuch ^ Beruf ^ Handwerk ^ Goldschmied.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A goldsmith workshop during the mid-seventeenth century]]

Gold has been worked by humans in all [[cultures]] where the metal is available, either indigenously or imported, and the history of these activities is extensive. Superbly made objects from the ancient cultures of [[Africa]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[India]], [[North America]], Mesoamerica, and South America grace museums and collections throughout the world. Some pieces date back thousands of years and were made using many techniques that still are used by modern goldsmiths. Techniques developed by some of those goldsmiths achieved a skill level that was lost and remained beyond the skills of those who followed, even to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;American Chemical Society, [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130724124919.htm ''Ancient technology for metal coatings 2,000 years ago can't be matched even today''], ScienceDaily, ScienceDaily, July 24, 2013,&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers attempting to uncover the chemical techniques used by ancient artisans have remarked that their findings confirm that "the high level of competence reached by the artists and craftsmen of these ancient periods who produced objects of an artistic quality that could not be bettered in ancient times and has not yet been reached in modern ones."&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Maria Ingo, Giuseppe Guida, Emma Angelini, Gabriella Di Carlo, Alessio Mezzi, Giuseppina Padeletti, ''Ancient Mercury-Based Plating Methods: Combined Use of Surface Analytical Techniques for the Study of Manufacturing Process and Degradation Phenomena'', Accounts of Chemical Research, 2013; 130705111206005 DOI: 10.1021/ar300232e&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=August 2018}}

In [[medieval]] Europe goldsmiths were organized into [[guild]]s and usually were one of the most important and wealthiest of the guilds in a city. The guild kept records of members and the marks they used on their products. These records, when they survive, are very useful to historians.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Goldsmiths often acted as [[banker]]s, since they dealt in gold and had sufficient security for the safe storage of valuable items. In the [[Middle Ages]], goldsmithing normally included silversmithing as well, but the brass workers and workers in other [[base metal]]s normally were members of a separate guild, since the trades were not allowed to overlap. Many [[jeweler]]s also were goldsmiths.

The [[Sunar]] caste is one of the oldest communities in goldsmithing in India, whose superb gold artworks were displayed at [[The Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London. In India, '[[Vishwakarma (caste)|Vishwakarma]]' are the goldsmith caste.

The [[printmaking]] technique of [[engraving]] developed among goldsmiths in Germany around 1430, who had long used the technique on their metal pieces. The notable [[engraver]]s of the fifteenth century were either goldsmiths, such as [[Master E. S.]], or the sons of goldsmiths, such as [[Martin Schongauer]] and [[Albrecht Dürer]].

==Contemporary goldsmithing==

A goldsmith might have a wide array of skills and knowledge at their disposal. [[Gold]], being the most [[malleable]] metal of all, offers unique opportunities for the worker. In today's world a wide variety of other metals, especially [[platinum]] alloys, also may be used frequently. 24 [[karat (purity)|karat]] is pure gold and historically, was known as [[fine gold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = McQuhae | first = William | title = McQuhae's Practical Technical Instructor | page = 91 | publisher =  | year =  | edition = 3rd | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_c5sEPzM4GQC&amp;pg=PA91 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is so soft, however, 24 karat gold is rarely used. It usually is [[alloy]]ed to make it stronger and to create different colors; goldsmiths may have some skill in that process. The gold may be [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] into some item then, usually with the [[lost wax casting]] process, or it may be used to fabricate the work directly in metal.

In the latter case, the goldsmith will use a variety of tools and machinery, including the [[rolling mill]], the [[drawplate]], and perhaps, [[swage block]]s and other forming tools to make the metal into shapes needed to build the intended piece. Then parts are fabricated through a wide variety of processes and assembled by [[brazing|soldering]]. It is a testament to the history and evolution of the trade that those skills have reached an extremely high level of attainment and skill over time. A fine goldsmith can and will work to a tolerance approaching that of precision machinery, but largely using only his eyes and hand tools. Quite often the goldsmith's job involves the making of mountings for [[gemstone]]s, in which case they often are referred to as ''jewelers''.

'Jeweller', however, is a term mostly reserved for a person who deals in jewellery (buys and sells) and not to be confused with a goldsmith, silversmith, gemologist, diamond cutter, and diamond setters. A 'jobbing jeweller' is the term for a jeweller who undertakes a small basic amount of jewellery repair and alteration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">A '''harpsichordist''' is a person who plays the [[harpsichord]].

Many [[baroque music|baroque]] composers played the harpsichord, including [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[François Couperin]] and [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]. At this time, it was common for such musicians also to play the [[pipe organ|organ]], and all [[keyboard instrument]]s, and to direct orchestral music while playing [[Figured bass|continuo]] on the instrument.

Modern harpsichord playing can be roughly divided into three eras, beginning with the career of the influential reviver of the instrument, [[Wanda Landowska]]. At this stage of the 'harpsichord revival', players generally used harpsichords of a heavy, piano-influenced type made by makers such as [[Ignaz Pleyel|Pleyel]]; the revival of the instrument also led some composers to write specifically for the instrument, often on the request of Landowska. An influential later group of English players using post-Pleyel instruments by Thomas Goff and the [[Robert Goble|Goble]] family included [[George Malcolm (musician)|George Malcolm]] and [[Thurston Dart]]. Beginning in the 1920s, [[Gavin Williamson (harpsichordist)|Gavin Williamson]] and [[Philip Manuel]] also helped popularize the harpsichord through concert tours, and were, in fact, the world's only full-time harpsichord duo, known as Manuel and Williamson, performing throughout North American and Europe. They had studied for many years with Wanda Landowska both in France and in New York. In the 1930s Manual and Williamson made the first recordings of the Bach multiple keyboard concerti with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and the duo also gave the American premiere performance of Bach's Concerto in C major for two harpsichords. In addition, they gave American premieres of many works of Couperin and Rameau, among other composers. &lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-04-25/news/8904070185_1_harpsichords-music-mr-williamson|title=Gavin Williamson: Helped save harpsichord|publisher=Chicago Trubune|accessdate=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next generation of harpsichordists were pioneers of modern performance on instruments built according to the [[Authentic performance|authentic practices]] of the earlier period, following the research of such scholar-builders as [[Frank Hubbard]] and [[William Dowd]]. This generation of performers included such players as [[Isolde Ahlgrimm|Isohlde Ahlgrimm]],  [[Ralph Kirkpatrick]], [[Igor Kipnis]], and [[Gustav Leonhardt]]. More recently, many outstanding harpsichordists have appeared, such as [[Scott Ross (harpsichordist)|Scott Ross]], [[Trevor Pinnock]], [[Kenneth Gilbert]], [[Christopher Hogwood]], [[Jos van Immerseel]], [[Ton Koopman]], [[Gary Cooper (musician)|Gary Cooper]] and [[David Schrader]], with many of them also directing a [[baroque orchestra]] from the instrument.

He has researched and written widely on religious matters, from [[Celtic Christianity]] to the future of [[spirituality]] in Britain. In addition, he has published works on the subjects of [[hymnody]], monarchy, the [[Victorian era]], [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and [[musical theatre]].

==Life and career==

===Early life and education===
Ian Bradley was born in [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]], on [[Whit Sunday]] 1950.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.studia.no/vare.php?ean=9780826482822 Daily Telegraph Book of Hymns - Studia AS - Bokhandel]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in the southeast of England and was educated at [[Tonbridge School]] and [[New College, Oxford]], from which he graduated with a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First Class Honours|first-class honours degree]] in modern history.  He remained at [[Oxford|University of Oxford]] to complete a [[doctoral thesis]] on religion and politics in early nineteenth-century Britain, earning his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] degree.

===Career===
Bradley subsequently worked in radio and television production with the [[BBC]]. He spent five years on the staff of ''[[The Times]]'' (and was a features writer for ''The Times'' for eight years) and then combined freelance writing with teaching at [[Cranleigh School]] in [[Surrey]]. Following further study at the [[University of St Andrews]], from which he graduated with a first-class honours [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] degree in [[theology]], Bradley was ordained to the ministry of the [[Church of Scotland]] and appointed Head of Religious Broadcasting for [[BBC Scotland]]. He has lived in Scotland since 1985. He sat on the committee that drafted the [[Hymnbooks of the Church of Scotland#Church Hymnary, fourth edition (2005)|Church of Scotland's Hymnary (Fourth Edition)]], which was published in 2005. Bradley has taught in the areas of Christianity in contemporary Britain; hymnody, liturgy and worship; monarchy, church and state; and the theology of [[musical theatre]]. According to his profile in his 1997 book ''Abide with Me'', he was one of the first lecturers to teach an honors course on hymnology at a British University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37548665|title=Abide With Me: The World of Victorian Hymns|last=Ian|first=Bradley|date=1997|publisher=SCM Press|isbn=033402692X|location=London|oclc=37548665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having lectured on [[church history]] at the [[University of Aberdeen]] for many years, Bradley was appointed to a position at the University of St Andrews in 1998, where he was later awarded a Chair in Cultural and Spiritual History in its School of Divinity, where he was previously Principal of [[St Mary's College, St Andrews]]. He retired in 2017. He is also associate minister of Holy Trinity Church, St Andrews, and honorary Church of Scotland chaplain for the university.&lt;ref name=UnivBioPage/&gt;

As a journalist, Bradley contributes frequently to ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Tablet]]'' and ''[[Life and Work (magazine)|Life and Work]]'' as well as often appearing on [[television]] and [[BBC Radio 4]]. Bradley frequently writes, broadcasts and lectures about [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and has spoken numerous times at the [[International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival]]s in [[Buxton]] and [[Harrogate]], England. He performs regularly with the University of St Andrews Gilbert and Sullivan Society, of which he is honorary life president. He is the author of more than 30 books.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.penguin.co.nz/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000004855,00.html Penguin Group Authors - New Zealand] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927075652/http://www.penguin.co.nz/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000004855,00.html |date=27 September 2007 }}.

{{quantum field theory}}
A '''gauge theory''' is a type of [[Scientific theory|theory]] in [[physics]]. The word '''gauge''' means a [[Measurement|measurement]], a thickness, an in-between distance, (as in [[Track gauge|railroad tracks]]) or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a [[Gauge (bore diameter)|number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge&lt;/ref&gt; Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of [[Field (physics)|fields]], e.g., the [[electromagnetic field]], the [[gravitational field]], and fields that describe forces between the [[elementary particles]]. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, say you cannot measure the diameter of a lead ball, but you can determine how many lead balls, which are equal in every way, are required to make a pound. Using the number of balls, the elemental mass of lead, and the formula for calculating the volume of a sphere from its diameter, one could indirectly determine the diameter of a single lead ball.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gauge&lt;/ref&gt; In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a '''gauge transformation''';&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]] (2004) ''[[The Road to Reality]]'', p. 451. For an alternative formulation in terms of symmetries of the [[Lagrangian density]], see p. 489. Also see J. D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.&lt;/ref&gt; the lack of change in the measurable quantities, despite the field being transformed, is a property called '''gauge invariance'''. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of "color" would show '''gauge invariance'''. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]], gauge invariance is sometimes called '''gauge symmetry'''. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.

For example, in electromagnetism the electric and magnetic fields, '''E''' and '''B''' are observable, while the potentials ''V'' ("voltage") and '''A''' (the [[magnetic vector potential|vector potential]]) are not.&lt;ref&gt;For an argument that ''V'' and '''A''' are more fundamental, see Feynman, Leighton, and Sands, '''The Feynman Lectures''', Addison Wesley Longman, 1970, II-15-7,8,12, but this is partly a matter of personal preference.&lt;/ref&gt; Under a gauge transformation in which a constant is added to ''V'', no observable change occurs in '''E''' or '''B'''.

With the advent of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s, and with successive advances in [[quantum field theory]], the importance of gauge transformations has steadily grown. Gauge theories constrain the laws of physics, because all the changes induced by a gauge transformation have to cancel each other out when written in terms of observable quantities. Over the course of the 20th century, physicists gradually realized that all forces ([[fundamental interaction]]s) arise from the constraints imposed by [[local symmetry|''local'' gauge symmetries]], in which case the transformations vary from point to point in [[spacetime|space and time]]. [[Perturbation theory|Perturbative]] [[quantum field theory]] (usually employed for scattering theory) describes forces in terms of force-mediating particles called [[gauge boson]]s. The nature of these particles is determined by the nature of the gauge transformations. The culmination of these efforts is the [[Standard Model]], a quantum field theory that accurately predicts all of the fundamental interactions except [[gravity]].

==History and importance==

The earliest field theory having a gauge symmetry was [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s formulation, in 1864–65, of [[classical electrodynamics|electrodynamics]]  ("[[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]]"). The importance of this symmetry remained unnoticed in the earliest formulations. Similarly unnoticed, [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] had derived Einstein's equations of general relativity by postulating a symmetry under any change of coordinates.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}{{when|date=September 2015}}  Later [[Hermann Weyl]], inspired by success in Einstein's [[general relativity]], conjectured (incorrectly, as it turned out) in year 1919 that invariance under the change of [[scale (measurement)|scale]] or "gauge" (a term inspired by the various [[track gauge]]s of railroads) might also be a local symmetry of electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Weyl]] (1919), "Eine neue Erweiterung der Relativitíatstheorie," ''Ann. der Physik'' '''59''', 101–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moriyasu1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Moriyasu|title=An Elementary Primer for Gauge Theory|year=1983|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-9971-950-83-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5, 12}}  Although Weyl's choice of the gauge was incorrect, the name "gauge" stuck to the approach.  After the development of [[quantum mechanics]], Weyl, [[Vladimir Fock|Fock]] and [[Fritz London|London]] modified their gauge choice by replacing the scale factor with a change of wave [[phase (waves)|phase]], and applying it successfully to electromagnetism.&lt;ref&gt;For a review and references, see [[Lochlainn O’Raifeartaigh]] and Norbert Straumann, "Gauge theory: Historical origins and some modern developments," ''Reviews of Modern Physics'', 72 (2000), pp. 1–22, {{doi|10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge symmetry was generalized mathematically in 1954 by [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] in an attempt to describe the [[Strong interaction|strong nuclear forces]]. This idea, dubbed [[Yang–Mills theory]], later found application in the [[quantum field theory]] of the [[weak force]], and its unification with electromagnetism in the [[electroweak]] theory.

The importance of gauge theories for physics stems from their tremendous success in providing a unified framework to describe the [[quantum field theory|quantum-mechanical behavior]] of [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak force]] and the [[strong force]]. This gauge theory, known as the [[Standard model|Standard Model]], accurately describes experimental predictions regarding three of the four [[fundamental force]]s of nature.

==In classical physics==

===Electromagnetism===
{{Main|Gauge fixing}}
Historically, the first example of gauge symmetry to be discovered was classical [[electromagnetism]].{{clarify|post-text=Not for classical gravitational fields?|date=September 2015}} A static electric field can be described in terms of an [[electric potential]] (voltage) that is defined at every point in space, and in practical work it is conventional to take the Earth as a physical reference that defines the zero level of the potential, or [[electrical ground|ground]]. But only ''differences'' in potential are physically measurable, which is the reason that a [[voltmeter]] must have two probes, and can only report the voltage difference between them. Thus one could choose to define all voltage differences relative to some other standard, rather than the Earth, resulting in the addition of a constant offset.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Purcell (1963) ''Electricity and Magnetism''. McGraw-Hill: 38.&lt;/ref&gt; If the potential &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a solution to [[Maxwell's equations]] then, after this gauge transformation, the new potential &lt;math&gt;V \rightarrow V+C&lt;/math&gt; is also a solution to Maxwell's equations and no experiment can distinguish between these two solutions. In other words, the laws of physics governing electricity and magnetism (that is, Maxwell equations) are invariant under gauge transformation.&lt;ref&gt;J.D. Jackson (1975) ''Classical Electrodynamics'', 2nd ed. Wiley and Sons: 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Maxwell's equations have a gauge symmetry.

Generalizing from static electricity to electromagnetism, we have a second potential, the [[magnetic vector potential]] '''A''', which can also undergo gauge transformations. These transformations may be local. That is, rather than adding a constant onto ''V'', one can add a function that takes on different values at different points in space and time. If '''A''' is also changed in certain corresponding ways, then the same '''E''' and '''B''' fields result. The detailed mathematical relationship between the fields '''E''' and '''B''' and the potentials ''V'' and '''A''' is given in the article [[Gauge fixing]], along with the precise statement of the nature of the gauge transformation. The relevant point here is that the fields remain the same under the gauge transformation, and therefore [[Maxwell's equations]] are still satisfied.

Gauge symmetry is closely related to [[charge conservation]]. Suppose that there existed some process by which one could briefly violate conservation of charge by creating a charge ''q'' at a certain point in space, 1, moving it to some other point 2, and then destroying it. We might imagine that this process was consistent with conservation of energy. We could posit a rule stating that creating the charge required an input of energy ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and destroying it released ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which would seem natural since ''qV'' measures the extra energy stored in the electric field because of the existence of a charge at a certain point. Outside of the interval during which the particle exists, conservation of energy would be satisfied, because the net energy released by creation and destruction of the particle, ''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, would be equal to the work done in moving the particle from 1 to 2, ''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. But although this scenario salvages conservation of energy, it violates gauge symmetry. Gauge symmetry requires that the laws of physics be invariant under the transformation &lt;math&gt;V \rightarrow V+C&lt;/math&gt;, which implies that no experiment should be able to measure the absolute potential, without reference to some external standard such as an electrical ground. But the proposed rules ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=''qV''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for the energies of creation and destruction ''would'' allow an experimenter to determine the absolute potential, simply by comparing the energy input required to create the charge ''q'' at a particular point in space in the case where the potential is &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V+C&lt;/math&gt; respectively. The conclusion is that if gauge symmetry holds, and energy is conserved, then charge must be conserved.&lt;ref&gt;Donald H. Perkins (1982) ''Introduction to High-Energy Physics''. Addison-Wesley: 92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Diffeomorphism of a square.svg|right|thumb|The Cartesian coordinate grid on this square has been distorted by a coordinate transformation, so that there is a nonlinear relationship between the old (x,y) coordinates and the new ones. Einstein's equations of general relativity are still valid in the new coordinate system. Such changes of coordinate system are the gauge transformations of general relativity.]]

===General relativity===
As discussed above, the gauge transformations for classical (i.e., non-quantum mechanical) [[general relativity]] are arbitrary coordinate transformations.&lt;ref name="Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260"&gt;[[Robert M. Wald]] (1984) ''General Relativity''. University of Chicago Press: 260.&lt;/ref&gt;  Technically, the transformations must be invertible, and both the transformation and its inverse must be smooth, in the sense of being [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] an arbitrary number of times.

====An example of a symmetry in a physical theory: translation invariance====
Some global symmetries under changes of coordinate predate both general relativity and the concept of a gauge. For example, [[Galileo]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] introduced the notion of [[Galilean transformation|translation invariance]]{{when|date=September 2015}}, an advancement from the [[Aristotelian physics|Aristotelian]] concept that different places in space, such as the earth versus the heavens, obeyed different physical rules.

Suppose, for example, that one observer examines the properties of a hydrogen atom on Earth, the other—on the Moon (or any other place in the universe), the observer will find that their hydrogen atoms exhibit completely identical properties. Again, if one observer had examined a hydrogen atom today and the other—100 years ago (or any other time in the past or in the future), the two experiments would again produce completely identical results. The invariance of the properties of a hydrogen atom with respect to the time and place where these properties were investigated is called translation invariance.

Recalling our two observers from different ages: the time in their experiments is shifted by 100 years. If the time when the older observer did the experiment was ''t'', the time of the modern experiment is ''t''+100 years. Both observers discover the same laws of physics. Because light from hydrogen atoms in distant galaxies may reach the earth after having traveled across space for billions of years, in effect one can do such observations covering periods of time almost all the way back to the [[Big Bang]], and they show that the laws of physics have always been the same.

In other words, if in the theory we change the time ''t'' to ''t''+100 years (or indeed any other time shift) the theoretical predictions do not change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Misner]], [[Kip Thorne]], and [[John A. Wheeler]] (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Another example of a symmetry: the invariance of Einstein's field equation under arbitrary coordinate transformations====
In Einstein's [[general relativity]], coordinates like ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', and ''t'' are not only "relative" in the global sense of translations like &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t+C&lt;/math&gt;, rotations, etc., but become completely arbitrary, so that, for example, one can define an entirely new time-like coordinate according to some arbitrary rule such as &lt;math&gt;t \rightarrow t+t^3/t_0^2&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;t_0&lt;/math&gt; has units of time, and yet [[Einstein's equations]] will have the same form.&lt;ref name="Robert M. Wald 1984, p. 260"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973) ''[[Gravitation (book)|Gravitation]]''. W. H. Freeman: 967.&lt;/ref&gt;

Invariance of the form of an equation under an arbitrary coordinate transformation is customarily referred to as [[general covariance]], and equations with this property are referred to as written in the covariant form. General covariance is a special case of gauge invariance.

Maxwell's equations can also be expressed in a generally covariant form, which is as invariant under general coordinate transformation as Einstein's field equation.

==In quantum mechanics==

===Quantum electrodynamics===
Until the advent of quantum mechanics, the only well known example of gauge symmetry was in electromagnetism, and the general significance of the concept was not fully understood. For example, it was not clear whether it was the fields '''E''' and '''B''' or the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that were the fundamental quantities; if the former, then the gauge transformations could be considered as nothing more than a mathematical trick.

===Aharonov–Bohm experiment===
[[Image:Double slit diffraction.svg|right|thumb|Double-slit diffraction and interference pattern]]

{{Main|Aharonov–Bohm effect}}
In quantum mechanics, a particle such as an electron is also described as a wave. For example, if the [[double-slit experiment]] is performed with electrons, then a wave-like interference pattern is observed. The electron has the highest probability of being detected at locations where the parts of the wave passing through the two slits are in phase with one another, resulting in [[wave interference|constructive interference]]. The frequency of the electron ''wave'' is related to the kinetic energy of an individual electron ''particle'' via the quantum-mechanical relation ''E'' = ''hf''. If there are no electric or magnetic fields present in this experiment, then the electron's energy is constant, and, for example, there will be a high probability of detecting the electron along the central axis of the experiment, where by symmetry the two parts of the wave are in phase.

But now suppose that the electrons in the experiment are subject to electric or magnetic fields. For example, if an electric field was imposed on one side of the axis but not on the other, the results of the experiment would be affected. The part of the electron wave passing through that side oscillates at a different rate, since its energy has had −''eV'' added to it, where −''e'' is the charge of the electron and ''V'' the electrical potential. The results of the experiment will be different, because phase relationships between the two parts of the electron wave have changed, and therefore the locations of constructive and destructive interference will be shifted to one side or the other. It is the electric potential that occurs here, not the electric field, and this is a manifestation of the fact that it is the potentials and not the fields that are of fundamental significance in quantum mechanics.

[[Image:Aharonov-Bohm effect.svg|thumbnail|left|250px|Schematic of double-slit experiment in which Aharonov–Bohm effect can be observed: electrons pass through two slits, interfering at an observation screen, with the interference pattern shifted when a magnetic field '''B''' is turned on in the cylindrical solenoid, marked in blue on the diagram.]]

====Explanation with potentials====
It is even possible to have cases in which an experiment's results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the [[Aharonov–Bohm effect]], shown in the figure.&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, Leighton, and Sands (1970) ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''. Addison Wesley, vol. II, chpt. 15, section 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, turning on the solenoid only causes a magnetic field '''B''' to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then one would expect that the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because turning on the solenoid changed the vector potential '''A''' in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials '''V''' and '''A''' that are fundamental, and not the fields '''E''' and '''B''', we can see that the gauge transformations, which change '''V''' and '''A''', have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.

====Gauge invariance: the results of the experiments are independent of the choice of the gauge for the potentials====
Note that in these experiments, the only quantity that affects the result is the ''difference'' in phase between the two parts of the electron wave. Suppose we imagine the two parts of the electron wave as tiny clocks, each with a single hand that sweeps around in a circle, keeping track of its own phase. Although this cartoon ignores some technical details, it retains the physical phenomena that are important here.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Feynman]] (1985) ''[[QED: The Strange Theory of Light and Matter]]''. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; If both clocks are sped up by the same amount, the phase relationship between them is unchanged, and the results of experiments are the same. Not only that, but it is not even necessary to change the speed of each clock by a ''fixed'' amount. We could change the angle of the hand on each clock by a ''varying'' amount θ, where θ could depend on both the position in space and on time. This would have no effect on the result of the experiment, since the final observation of the location of the electron occurs at a single place and time, so that the phase shift in each electron's "clock" would be the same, and the two effects would cancel out. This is another example of a gauge transformation: it is local, and it does not change the results of experiments.

===Summary===
In summary, gauge symmetry attains its full importance in the context of quantum mechanics. In the application of quantum mechanics to electromagnetism, i.e., [[quantum electrodynamics]], gauge symmetry applies to both electromagnetic waves and electron waves. These two gauge symmetries are in fact intimately related. If a gauge transformation θ is applied to the electron waves, for example, then one must also apply a corresponding transformation to the potentials that describe the electromagnetic waves.&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Hill Perkins|Donald H. Perkins]] (1982) ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Introduction_to_High_Energy_Physics.html?id=e63cNigcmOUC Introduction to High-Energy Physics]''. Addison-Wesley: 332.&lt;/ref&gt; Gauge symmetry is required in order to make quantum electrodynamics a [[renormalization|renormalizable]] theory, i.e., one in which the calculated predictions of all physically measurable quantities are finite.

===Types of gauge symmetries===
The description of the electrons in the subsection above as little clocks is in effect a statement of the mathematical rules according to which the phases of electrons are to be added and subtracted: they are to be treated as ordinary numbers, except that in the case where the result of the calculation falls outside the range of 0≤θ&lt;360°, we force it to "wrap around" into the allowed range, which covers a circle. Another way of putting this is that a phase angle of, say, 5° is considered to be completely equivalent to an angle of 365°. Experiments have verified this testable statement about the interference patterns formed by electron waves. Except for the "wrap-around" property, the algebraic properties of this mathematical structure are exactly the same as those of the ordinary real numbers.

In mathematical terminology, electron phases form an [[Abelian group]] under addition, called the [[circle group]] or ''U''(1). "Abelian" means that addition  [[commutative law|commutes]], so that θ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;φ&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;θ. [[group (mathematics)|Group]] means that addition [[associativity|associates]] and has an [[identity element]], namely "0". Also, for every phase there exists an [[inverse element|inverse]] such that the sum of a phase and its inverse is 0. Other examples of abelian groups are the integers under addition, 0, and negation, and the nonzero fractions under product, 1, and reciprocal.

[[Image:gauge.png|right|thumb|Gauge fixing of a ''twisted'' cylinder.]]
As a way of visualizing the choice of a gauge, consider whether it is possible to tell if a cylinder has been twisted. If the cylinder has no bumps, marks, or scratches on it, we cannot tell. We could, however, draw an arbitrary curve along the cylinder, defined by some function θ(''x''), where ''x'' measures distance along the axis of the cylinder. Once this arbitrary choice (the choice of gauge) has been made, it becomes possible to detect it if someone later twists the cylinder.

In 1954, [[Chen Ning Yang]] and [[Robert Mills (physicist)|Robert Mills]] proposed to generalize these ideas to noncommutative groups. A noncommutative gauge group can describe a field that, unlike the electromagnetic field, interacts with itself. For example, [[general relativity]] states that gravitational fields have energy, and [[special relativity]] concludes that energy is equivalent to mass. Hence a gravitational field induces a further gravitational field. The [[nuclear forces]] also have this self-interacting property.

===Gauge bosons===
Surprisingly, gauge symmetry can give a deeper explanation for the existence of interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of [[superposition principle|superposition]], which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows that we are not even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which it turns out that the mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(''x''), where an angle θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θ&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.

According to the principles of quantum mechanics, particles do not actually have trajectories through space. Motion can only be described in terms of waves, and the momentum ''p'' of an individual particle is related to its wavelength λ by ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''λ''. In terms of empirical measurements, the wavelength can only be determined by observing a change in the wave between one point in space and another nearby point (mathematically, by [[derivative|differentiation]]). A wave with a shorter wavelength oscillates more rapidly, and therefore changes more rapidly between nearby points. Now suppose that we arbitrarily fix a gauge at one point in space, by saying that the energy at that location is 20% A's and 80% B's. We then measure the two waves at some other, nearby point, in order to determine their wavelengths. But there are two entirely different reasons that the waves could have changed. They could have changed because they were oscillating with a certain wavelength, or they could have changed because the gauge function changed from a 20-80 mixture to, say, 21-79. If we ignore the second possibility, the resulting theory doesn't work; strange discrepancies in momentum will show up, violating the principle of conservation of momentum. Something in the theory must be changed.

Again there are technical issues relating to spin, but in several important cases, including electrically charged particles and particles interacting via nuclear forces, the solution to the problem is to impute physical reality to the gauge function θ(''x''). We say that if the function θ oscillates, it represents a new type of quantum-mechanical wave, and this new wave has its own momentum ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''h''/''λ'', which turns out to patch up the discrepancies that otherwise would have broken conservation of momentum. In the context of electromagnetism, the particles A and B would be charged particles such as electrons, and the quantum mechanical wave represented by θ would be the electromagnetic field. (Here we ignore the technical issues raised by the fact that electrons actually have spin 1/2, not spin zero. This oversimplification is the reason that the gauge field θ comes out to be a scalar, whereas the electromagnetic field is actually represented by a vector consisting of ''V'' and '''A'''.) The result is that we have an explanation for the presence of electromagnetic interactions: if we try to construct a gauge-symmetric theory of identical, non-interacting particles, the result is not self-consistent, and can only be repaired by adding electric and magnetic fields that cause the particles to interact.

Although the function θ(''x'') describes a wave, the laws of quantum mechanics require that it also have particle properties. In the case of electromagnetism, the particle corresponding to electromagnetic waves is the photon. In general, such particles are called [[gauge bosons]], where the term "boson" refers to a particle with integer spin. In the simplest versions of the theory, gauge bosons are massless, but it is also possible to construct versions in which they have mass, as is the case for the gauge bosons that transmit the nuclear decay forces.

[[Image:Jean-Luc Ponty.jpg|thumb|200 px| French jazz violinist [[Jean-Luc Ponty]] is an influential jazz-rock fusion performer]]

'''Jazz violin''' is the use of the violin or [[electric violin]] to improvise solo lines. The earliest references to jazz performance using the violin as a solo instrument was during the first decades of the 20th century. Early jazz violinists included [[Eddie South]], who played violin with [[Jimmy Wade]]'s Dixielanders in Chicago; [[Stuff Smith]]; [[Claude Williams (musician)|Claude "Fiddler" Williams]], who played with [[Andy Kirk (musician)|Andy Kirk]] and his Twelve Clouds of Joy. [[Joe Venuti]] was best known for his work with guitarist [[Eddie Lang]] during the 1920s. [[Georgie Stoll]] was a jazz violinist who became an orchestra leader and film music director.

Since that time there have been many [[List of jazz violinists|superb improvising violinists]] including [[Noel Pointer]], [[Stéphane Grappelli]] and [[Jean-Luc Ponty]]. While not primarily jazz violinists, [[Darol Anger]] and [[Mark O'Connor]] have spent significant parts of their careers playing jazz, while artists like [[Sara Caswell]], [[Scott Tixier]] and [[Jeremy Kittel]] are equally fluent in both progressive and older styles of jazz. Violins also appear in string ensembles or big bands supplying orchestral backgrounds to many jazz recordings. Recent fast progress in the modern jazz violin expression has resulted in extensive pedagogical research and publishing. Among the best-known and worldwidely acknowledged contributions in advanced instrumental technique is ''Stringprovisation''&lt;ref&gt;[https://mtsnet.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/a-review-update-on-ari-poutiainens-stringprovisation-%E2%80%93-a-fingering-strategy-for-jazz-violin-improvisation-amf-28/ Reviews on ''Stringprovisation'']&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ari Poutiainen]].

The violin is a [[Bow (music)|bowed]] [[string instrument]] with four [[strings (music)|strings]] usually tuned in [[perfect fifth]]s. It is the smallest and highest-pitched member of the [[violin family]] of string instruments, which also includes the [[viola]], [[cello]], and [[double bass]]. A violinist produces sound by either drawing a bow (normally held in the right hand) across one or more strings (which may be ''stopped'' by the fingers of the other hand to produce a full range of pitches), ''plucking'' the strings (with either hand), or a [[Playing the violin|variety of other techniques]]. In jazz-rock fusion styles, jazz violinists may use an electric violin plugged into an [[instrument amplifier]] along with effects such as a [[wah pedal]] or a distortion [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]].

==History==

===Traditional and Swing era===
[[Image:StephaneGrappelli25.JPG|thumb|150px| French jazz violinist Stéphane Grappelli founded the "Gypsy Jazz"-style [[Quintette du Hot Club de France]] with guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] before [[World War II]]]]

Jazz violinists included Clarence Black and J. Wright Smith, who recorded in the 1920s with [[Jelly Roll Morton]]. [[Joe Venuti]] paired with guitarist [[Eddie Lang]] until the latter's passing in 1933.  Classically trained [[Eddie South]] began his career in the 1920s and performed with Europeans following a 1928 visit there. [[Stuff Smith]], [[Ray Nance]] and [[Claude Williams (musician)|Claude Williams]] were other noteworthy jazz violinists.

European jazz violinists included [[Stéphane Grappelli]] (1908–1997), a [[French people|French]] [[jazz]] violinist who founded the [[Quintette du Hot Club de France]] with guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]]. It was one of the first all-string jazz bands. After the war he appeared on hundreds of recordings including sessions with [[Duke Ellington]], jazz pianists [[Oscar Peterson]] and [[Claude Bolling]], and jazz violinist Jean-Luc Ponty. [[Svend Asmussen]] (1916-2017) is a [[jazz]] violinist from [[Denmark]] who worked with [[Benny Goodman]], [[Lionel Hampton]], and [[Duke Ellington]]. Asmussen was invited by Ellington to play on the ''Jazz Violin Session'' recording in 1963 with Stéphane Grappelli and [[Ray Nance]].

===Jazz fusion===

[[Jean-Luc Ponty]] (born 1942) is a virtuoso French violinist and [[jazz]] composer. By the mid-1960s he had moved towards jazz, recording with [[Stéphane Grappelli]] and [[Stuff Smith]]. Ponty's attraction to jazz was propelled by [[Miles Davis]]'s and [[John Coltrane]]'s music, which led him to adopt the electric violin. Critic [[Joachim Berendt]] wrote that "Since Ponty, the jazz violin has been a different instrument" and of his "style of [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]] that corresponds to early and middle [[John Coltrane]]" and his "brilliance and fire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Berendt, Joachim E | title=The Jazz Book | publisher=Paladin | year=1976}}, p301&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1967 he visited the US for the [[Monterey Jazz Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.united-mutations.com/p/jean_luc_ponty.htm Ponty bio]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ponty subsequently worked with Stéphane Grappelli, the [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]] (succeeding [[Jerry Goodman]]), and [[Frank Zappa]], and appeared on more than 70 recordings.

His symphonic approach to [[jazz fusion]] made him a popular fusion artist of the 1970s. In 1972, he featured prominently on [[Elton John]]'s ''[[Honky Chateau]]'' album. In 1977, he pioneered the use of the 5-string electric violin, with a lower C string. He sometimes also uses a 6-string electric violin called the [[Violectra]], with low C and F strings – not to be confused with the violectra he played from the late 1960s to the mid-80s which had 4 strings, but tuned an octave lower. Ponty was among the first to combine the violin with [[MIDI]], electronic distortion boxes, phase shifters, and wah-wah pedals. This resulted in his signature, almost synthesizer-like sound. In 2005, Ponty formed the acoustic jazz fusion [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Trio!]] with bassist [[Stanley Clarke]] and [[banjo]]ist [[Béla Fleck]].

==Modern Jazz Scene==
The violin is well-represented in modern jazz and improvisational music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=news&amp;subsect=news_detail&amp;nid=2748 Iyer Voted Jazz Artist of the Year in DownBeat Critics Poll.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822214718/http://downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=news&amp;subsect=news_detail&amp;nid=2748 |date=2015-08-22 }} ''DownBeat Magazine'' June 23, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Feldman]] (born 1955) is one of the leading performers in modern and contemporary jazz violin, along with [[Jean-Luc Ponty]], and [[Mat Maneri]]. [[Regina Carter]] regularly tops both readers' and critic's polls while playing in an earthy, [[R&amp;B]]-influenced style.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jazztimes.com/articles/156793-the-2014-expanded-critics-poll The 2014 Expanded Critics Poll.] ''JazzTimes'', March 13, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2014/03/05/283506847/regina-carters-jazz-genealogy Regina Carter's Jazz Genealogy: NPR.] ''NPR Music'', March 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zach Brock]] and [[Scott Tixier]] are examples of the younger generation of jazz violinists gaining wider recognition. [[Ola Kvernberg]], Bjarke Falgren and [[Ari Poutiainen]] again represent original voices from the [[Northern Europe]].

==Electric violins==
[[Image:Transformation.JPG|thumb|An acoustic violin and an electric violin with a cut-away body]]
In jazz-rock fusion styles, jazz violinists may use an electric violin. Jazz fusion groups typically use rock instruments such as electric guitar, bass guitar, electric keyboards, and drums; to compete with these loud instruments, violinists often use an amplified violin that is plugged into an [[instrument amplifier]].  Moreover, the use of an electric violin allows the violinist to apply effects such as a [[wah pedal]], [[phaser (effect)|phaser]], [[reverb]], or a distortion [[Distortion (music)|fuzzbox]], to create unusual new sounds.

An electric violin is a violin equipped with an electric signal output of its sound, and is generally considered to be a specially constructed instrument which can either be an ''electro-acoustic violin'' capable of producing both acoustic sound and electric signal or an ''electric violin'' capable of producing only electric signal. To be effective as an acoustic violin, electro-acoustic violins retain much of the resonating body of the violin, often looking very much like, sometimes even identical to, an acoustic violin or fiddle.  They are often varnished with bright colours and made from alternative materials to wood.

The first specially built electric violins date back to the late 1930s and were made by Victor Pfeil, Oskar Vierling, George Eisenberg, [[Benjamin Miessner]], [[George Beauchamp]], [[Hugo Benioff]] and Fredray Kislingbury.  The majority of the first [[electric violinist]]s were musicians playing jazz and popular music. Electric violins typically have piezoelectric [[transducer]] [[Pickup (music technology)|pickups]] and/or magnetic pickups built into the body of the instrument. Like an electric guitar, an electric violin may also have volume and tone [[potentiometer]] knobs for controlling the sound of the instrument.

Like other electro-acoustic or electric instruments, an electric violin is often patched into a [[preamplifier]], impedance-matching device, and/or a [[DI unit|Direct Injection]] (DI box) box before it is routed to the [[PA system]], electronic effects, or the instrument amplifier.

[[Image:Lib ru.jpg|80px|thumb|Screenshot of main page of Maksim Moshkow's Library]]
'''Lib.ru''', also known as '''Maksim Moshkow's Library''' ({{lang-ru|Библиоте́ка Макси́ма Мошко́ва}}, started to operate in November 1994) is the oldest [[electronic library]] in the [[Internet in Russia|Russian Internet segment]].

Founded and supported by [[Maksim Moshkow]], it receives contributions mainly from users who send texts they scanned and processed ([[Optical character recognition|OCR]], [[proofreading]]). This method of acquisition provides the library a broad and efficient augmentability, though sometimes it adversely affects the quality (errors, omissions).

The structure of the library includes a section where one can publish his own literary texts ("[[Samizdat]]" journal), a project for music publishing ("Music hosting"), a travel notes project ("Foreign countries") and some other sections (See ''Maksim Moshkow's projects collection'' section).

''Maksim Moshkow's Library'' received several Ru-net Awards, including the National Internet Award (2003).

The headline on the site Lib.ru says "With support from the [[Rospechat|Federal Press and Mass Communications Agency]]". According to Moshkow, his project received $35,000 from that organization in September 2005, which indicates some level of government support for the online publishing of in-copyright works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=4005 |title=Maksim Moshkow and lib.ru: Russia's own 'Gutenberg' {{!}} TeleRead: Bring the E-Books Home |last1=Carey |first1=Quinn Anya |date=20 December 2005 |website={{URL|teleread.org}} |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927030404/http://www.teleread.org/blog/?p=4005 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maksim Moshkow's project could be compared to some [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects and is sometimes referred to as [[Russia]]'s [[Project Gutenberg]].

== KM Online vs. Maksim Moshkow's Library ==
{{Main|Gevorkyan v. Moshkov}}
[[Image:Maxim moshkov.jpg|left|thumb|Maxim Moshkow]]
On April 1, 2004 the "KM Online" media company, which is known for forming its own library by copying texts from the other electronic libraries, issued a [[lawsuit]] against Maksim Moshkow's Library in the name of [[Eduard Gevorkian]], Marina Alekseyeva (pen-name "[[Alexandra Marinina]]"), [[Vasili Golovachov]] and [[Elena Katasonova]]. It was later discovered that only Gevorkian had had real claims against Moshkow. Moshkow's lawyer was Andrey Mironov from the [[Art. Lebedev Studio|Artemi Lebedev Studio]], while KM's interests were presented by the so-called "National association on Digital Technologies (NOCIT)".

This case became a precedent in the Russian legal practice which illustrated pressure on an electronic library caused by a [[copyright violation]] lawsuit.

On March 30, 2005, [[Moscow]]'s [[Ostankino District|Ostankino]] city district court imposed a penalty on Maksim Moshkow to pay Eduard Gevorkian a total of 3000 [[Russian ruble]]s (around 120 USD) as compensation for [[moral damage]]. The ruling did not mention any compensation for copyright violation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

On May 30, 2006, another court order ruled that Moshkow had no right to publish online the works of [[William Shakespeare]], Harrison and Zinoviev and ordered him to pay 10,000 rubles in each case. Moshkow's lawyer said he would appeal the decision.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

== Spanish Romanticism ==

[[Romanticism in Spanish literature|Spanish Romanticism]] emerged in the years following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], and reached its apex in the 1840s. Much of Spanish Romanticism serves as criticism of contemporary Spanish society, as seen directly in the ''Articulos de Costumbre'' (essays on customs/daily life) by Larra. Important literary works in Spanish Romanticism include Larra's essays (each article published separately until 1836),  ''Don Juan Tenorio'' by Zorrilla (1844), ''El Estudiante de Salamanca'' (1840) and ''Poesias'' (1840) by Espronceda, and ''Rimas y Leyendas'' by Becquer (1871).

'''Mary Emily Eaton''' (27 November 1873 – 4 August 1961) was an English botanical artist best known for illustrating [[Nathaniel Lord Britton|Britton]] &amp; [[Joseph Nelson Rose|Rose]]'s ''[[The Cactaceae]]'', published between 1919 and 1923.&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;

[[Image:The Cactaceae Vol III, plate XIX filtered.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Plate XIX from ''The Cactaceae''&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Life==
Mary Emily Eaton was born on 27 November 1873 in [[Coleford, Gloucestershire]]. She attended private schools in London and received formal tuition in art at the [[Somerset College of Arts and Technology|Taunton School of Art]], also attending classes at the [[Royal College of Art]] in [[South Kensington]], and the [[Chelsea Polytechnic]].&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;

She worked for a time as a painter of [[Worcester porcelain]], before going to [[Jamaica]] in 1909 to visit her siblings.&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name=kramer1/&gt; During her two-years stay, she began painting detailed studies of butterflies and moths.&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;

In June 1911 Eaton left for [[New York City]], where she would remain until January 1932, employed by [[The New York Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt;&lt;ref name=kramer1/&gt; Among other duties, she was the principal illustrator for the Botanical Garden's journal ''[[Addisonia (journal)|Addisonia]]'', painting over three-quarters of the 800 plates. She was the principal illustrator for Britton &amp; Rose's monumental work ''[[The Cactaceae]]'', and her illustrations also appeared in the [[National Geographic Magazine]]. Contemporary authorities rated her work very highly, one source calling her "the greatest of living wildflower painters" and another stating that one could not fully appreciate her talent from the sometimes mediocre reproductions of her work in ''Addisonia'' and other publications.&lt;ref name=kramer1/&gt;

She was awarded the silver-gilt Grenfell Medal of the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] twice, first in 1922 and again in 1950.&lt;ref name=kramer1/&gt;

In 1932, due to the [[Great Depression]], Eaton lost her position at the Botanic Garden, after which she struggled to find enough work in America.&lt;ref name=kramer1/&gt;  In 1947, she returned to England, where she died on 4 August 1961 in [[Cossington, Somerset]]. Many of her paintings are at the [[Natural History Museum, London|British Museum of Natural History]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.asba-art.org/article/botanica-collected-mary-emily-eaton|title=Mary Emily Eaton and Her Cactaceae Paintings|author=Angell, Bobbi|journal=The Botanical Artist|volume=15|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hunt Institute for Botanical Documentation also has a number of her works.&lt;ref name=smithsonian/&gt; Six hundred of her watercolours are part of the permanent collections of the [[National Geographic Society]], [[The New York Botanical Garden]] and the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

'''''Memento mori''''' ([[Latin]]: "remember (that) you will die")&lt;ref name='oed'&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/memento-mori Literally 'remember (that you have) to die'], [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third Edition, June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; is the medieval [[Latin Christian]] theory and practice of reflection on mortality, especially as a means of considering the [[Vanitas|vanity of earthly life]] and the [[transient nature of all earthly goods]] and pursuits. It is related to the ''[[ars moriendi]]'' ("The Art of Dying") and similar Western literature. ''Memento mori'' has been an important part of ascetic disciplines as a means of perfecting the character by cultivating detachment and other virtues, and by turning the attention towards the immortality of the soul and the afterlife.&lt;ref&gt;See Jeremy Taylor, ''[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, ''memento mori'' are artistic or symbolic reminders of mortality.&lt;ref name='oed' /&gt; In the European [[Christian art]] context, "the expression [...] developed with the growth of Christianity, which emphasized Heaven, Hell, and [[salvation]] of the soul in the afterlife".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Farewell: The Culture of Death and the Afterlife|url=http://maa.missouri.edu/exhibitions/finalfarewell/mementointro.html|publisher=Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri|accessdate=13 January 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606051921/http://maa.missouri.edu/exhibitions/finalfarewell/mementointro.html|archivedate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pronunciation and translation==
In English, the phrase is pronounced {{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|m|ɛ|n|t|oʊ|_|ˈ|m|ɔr|i}}, {{respell|mə|MEN|toh|_|MOR|ee}}.

''Memento'' is the [[wikt:second-person singular|2nd person singular]] [[Future tense|future]] [[Active voice|active]] [[Imperative mood|imperative]] of ''meminī'', "to remember, to bear in mind", usually serving as a warning: "remember!" ''Mori'' is the [[Present tense|present]] [[Active voice|active]] [[infinitive]] of the [[deponent verb]] ''morior'', literally "to die".&lt;ref&gt;Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]]'', ''ss.vv.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, "remember death" or "remember that you will die".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', Third Edition, ''[http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/233960 s.v.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==

===In classical antiquity===
[[Plato]]'s ''[[Phaedo]]'', where the death of [[Socrates]] is recounted, introduces the idea that the proper practice of philosophy is "about nothing else but dying and being dead".&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedo'', 64a4.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stoics]] of [[classical antiquity]] were particularly prominent in their use of this discipline, and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]'s letters are full of injunctions to meditate on death.&lt;ref&gt;See his [[Epistulae morales ad Lucilium|''Moral Letters to Lucilius'']].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Stoic [[Epictetus]] told his students that when kissing their child, brother, or friend, they should remind themselves that they are mortal, curbing their pleasure, as do "those who stand behind men in their triumphs and remind them that they are mortal"&lt;ref&gt;Epictetus, Discourses, 3.24&lt;/ref&gt;

===In early Christianity ===
The 2nd-century CE Christian writer [[Tertullian]] claimed that during his [[Roman triumph|triumphal procession]], a victorious general would have someone (in later versions, a slave) standing behind him, holding a crown over his head and whispering "Respice post te. Hominem te memento" ("Look after you [to the time after your death] and remember you're [only] a man."). Though in modern times this has become a standard [[Trope (literature)|trope]], in fact no ancient authors attest to this, and it may have been Christian moralizing rather than an accurate historical report.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mary Beard (classicist)|Mary Beard]], ''The Roman Triumph'', [[Harvard University Press]], 2009, {{ISBN|0674032187}}, p. 85–92&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Europe from the Medieval era to the Victorian era===
[[File:Dance of Death (replica of 15th century fresco; National Gallery of Slovenia).jpg|300px|thumb|''[[Danse Macabre|Dance of Death]]'' (15th-century fresco). No matter one's station in life, the Dance of Death unites all.]]
[[File:TombStJohnsChester.JPG|thumb|upright|Unshrouded skeleton on [[Diana Warburton]]'s tomb (dated 1693) in [[St John the Baptist's Church, Chester|St John the Baptist Church]], [[Chester]]]]
The thought was then utilized in [[Christianity]], whose strong emphasis on [[divine judgment]], [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]], [[Hell in Christian beliefs|hell]], and the [[Salvation in Christianity|salvation of the soul]] brought death to the forefront of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Dogmatics, Volume 2 (Carl E. Braaten, Robert W. Jenson), page 583&lt;/ref&gt; All ''memento mori'' works are products of [[Christian art]].&lt;ref&gt;Christian Art (Rowena Loverance), Harvard University Press, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Christian context, the ''memento mori'' acquires a moralizing purpose quite opposed to the ''[[nunc est bibendum]]'' (now is the time to drink) theme of [[classical antiquity]]. To the Christian, the prospect of death serves to emphasize the emptiness and fleetingness of earthly pleasures, luxuries, and achievements, and thus also as an invitation to focus one's thoughts on the prospect of the afterlife. A Biblical injunction often associated with the ''memento mori'' in this context is ''In omnibus operibus tuis memorare novissima tua, et in aeternum non peccabis'' (the [[Vulgate]]'s Latin rendering of [[Sirach|Ecclesiasticus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ecclesiasticus|7:40}}, "in all thy works be mindful of thy last end and thou wilt never sin.") This finds ritual expression in the rites of [[Ash Wednesday]], when ashes are placed upon the worshipers' heads with the words, "Remember Man that you are dust and unto dust you shall return."

[[File:Le Transi de René de Chalon (Ligier Richier).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Prince of Orange]] [[René of Châlon]] died in 1544 at age 25. His widow commissioned sculptor Ligier Richier to represent in the [[Cadaver Tomb of René of Chalon]] which shows him offering his heart to God, set against the painted splendour of his former worldly estate. Church of Saint-Étienne, [[Bar-le-Duc]].]]
The most obvious places to look for ''memento mori'' meditations are in funeral art and [[architecture]]. Perhaps the most striking to contemporary minds is the ''transi'' or ''[[cadaver tomb]]'', a tomb that depicts the decayed [[Dead body|corpse]] of the deceased. This became a fashion in the tombs of the wealthy in the fifteenth century, and surviving examples still create a stark reminder of the vanity of earthly riches. Later, [[Puritan]] [[tomb stone]]s in the colonial United States frequently depicted winged skulls, skeletons, or [[angel]]s snuffing out candles. These are among the numerous [[Skull (mythology)|themes associated with skull imagery]].

Another example of ''memento mori'' is provided by the chapels of bones, such as the [[Capela dos Ossos]] in [[Évora]] or the [[Capuchin Crypt]] in Rome. These are chapels where the walls are totally or partially covered by human remains, mostly bones. The entrance to the Capela dos Ossos has the following sentence: "We bones, lying here bare, await yours."

The ''[[danse macabre]]'' is another well-known example of the ''memento mori'' theme, with its dancing depiction of the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]] carrying off rich and poor alike. This and similar depictions of Death decorated many European churches. ''Danse Macabre'', Op. 40, is a tone poem for orchestra written in 1874 by French composer [[Camille Saint-Saëns]].

Timepieces were formerly an apt reminder that your time on Earth grows shorter with each passing minute. Public [[clock]]s would be decorated with mottos such as ''ultima forsan'' ("perhaps the last" [hour]) or ''vulnerant omnes, ultima necat'' ("they all wound, and the last kills"). Even today, clocks often carry the motto ''[[tempus fugit]]'', "time flees". Old striking clocks often sported [[automaton|automata]] who would appear and strike the hour; some of the celebrated automaton clocks from [[Augsburg]], Germany had Death striking the hour. The several computerized "[[death clock]]s" revive this old idea. Private people carried smaller reminders of their own mortality. [[Mary, Queen of Scots]] owned a large watch carved in the form of a [[silver]] skull, embellished with the lines of Horace, "Pale death knocks with the same tempo upon the huts of the poor and the towers of Kings."

In the late 16th and through the 17th century, ''memento mori'' rings were made.&lt;ref name=Taylor&gt;{{cite book |title=Finger Rings From Ancient Egypt to the Present Day |last=Taylor |first=Gerald |last2=Scarisbrick |first2=Diana |year=1978 |publisher=[[Ashmolean Museum]] |isbn=0-900090-54-5 |page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the theme in the artistic genre of still life is more often referred to as a ''[[vanitas]]'', Latin for "vanity". These include symbols of mortality, whether obvious ones such as skulls or more subtle ones such as a flower losing its petals. See the themes associated with [[Skull (symbolism)|the image of the skull]].
[[File:Young Man with a Skull, Frans Hals, National Gallery, London.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Frans Hals]], ''[[Young Man with a Skull]]'', c. 1626–28]]
[[File:StillLifeWithASkull.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philippe de Champaigne]]'s ''[[Vanitas]]'' (c.&amp;nbsp;1671) is reduced to three essentials: Life, Death, and Time]]

''Memento mori'' is also an important literary theme. Well-known literary meditations on death in English prose include Sir [[Thomas Browne]]'s ''[[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial]]'' and [[Jeremy Taylor]]'s ''[[Holy Living and Holy Dying]]''. These works were part of a [[Jacobean era|Jacobean]] [[melancholia|cult of melancholia]] that marked the end of the [[Elizabethan era]]. In the late eighteenth century, literary [[elegy|elegies]] were a common genre; [[Thomas Gray]]'s ''[[Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard]]'' and [[Edward Young]]'s ''Night Thoughts'' are typical members of the genre.

Apart from the genre of [[Music for the Requiem Mass|requiem]] and funeral music, there is also a rich tradition of ''memento mori'' in the [[Early Music]] of Europe. Especially those facing the ever-present death during the recurring [[bubonic plague]] [[pandemic]]s from the 1340s onward tried to toughen themselves by anticipating the inevitable in chants, from the simple [[Geisslerlieder]] of the [[Flagellant]] movement to the more refined cloistral or courtly songs. The lyrics often looked at life as a necessary and god-given [[vale of tears]] with death as a ransom, and they reminded people to lead sinless lives to stand a chance at [[Last Judgment|Judgment Day]]. The following two Latin stanzas (with their English translations) are typical of ''memento mori'' in medieval music; they are from the [[virelai]] ''ad mortem festinamus'' of the Catalan [[Llibre Vermell de Montserrat]] from 1399:
{{clear left}}
:''Vita brevis breviter in brevi finietur'',
:''Mors venit velociter quae neminem veretur'',
:''Omnia mors perimit et nulli miseretur.''
:''Ad mortem festinamus peccare desistamus.''

::Life is short, and shortly it will end;
::Death comes quickly and respects no one,
::Death destroys everything and takes pity on no one.
::To death we are hastening, let us refrain from sinning.

[[File:French - Pendant with a Monk and Death - Walters 71461.jpg|thumb|upright|French 16th/17th-century [[ivory]] [[pendant]], [[Monk]] and Death, recalling mortality and the certainty of death ([[Walters Art Museum]])]]
:''Ni conversus fueris et sicut puer factus''
:''Et vitam mutaveris in meliores actus,''
:''Intrare non poteris regnum Dei beatus.''
:''Ad mortem festinamus peccare desistamus.''

::If you do not turn back and become like a child,
::And change your life for the better,
::You will not be able to enter, blessed, the Kingdom of God.
::To death we are hastening, let us refrain from sinning.

===The salutation of the Hermits of St. Paul of France===
''Memento mori'' was the salutation used by the [[Hermits of St. Paul of France]] (1620-1633), also known as the Brothers of Death.&lt;ref&gt;F. McGahan, "Paulists", ''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'', 1912, ''[[s.v.]]'' Paulists&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes claimed that the [[Trappists]] use this salutation, but this is not true.&lt;ref&gt;E. Obrecht, "Trappists", ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', 1912, ''s.v.'' Trappists&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Self-Portrait by Thomas Smith circa 1680.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Thomas Smith (American painter)|Thomas Smith]]'s ''Self-Portrait'']]

===In Puritan America===
[[Colonial American art]] saw a large number of ''memento mori'' images due to [[Puritan]] influence. The Puritan community in 17th-century North America looked down upon art because they believed that it drew the faithful away from God and, if away from God, then it could only lead to the devil. However, portraits were considered historical records and, as such, they were allowed. [[Thomas Smith (American painter)|Thomas Smith]], a 17th-century Puritan, fought in many naval battles and also painted. In his self-portrait, we see these pursuits represented alongside a typical Puritan ''memento mori'' with a skull, suggesting his awareness of imminent death.

The poem underneath the skull emphasizes Thomas Smith's acceptance of death and of turning away from the world of the living:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Why why should I the World be minding, Therein a World of Evils Finding. Then Farwell World: Farwell thy jarres, thy Joies thy Toies thy Wiles thy Warrs. Truth Sounds Retreat: I am not sorye. The Eternall Drawes to him my heart, By Faith (which can thy Force Subvert) To Crowne me (after Grace) with Glory.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mexico's Day of the Dead===
[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|left|[[José Guadalupe Posada|Posada's]] 1910 ''[[La Calavera Catrina]]'']]
Much ''memento mori'' art is associated with the [[Mexican culture|Mexican festival]] [[Day of the Dead]], including skull-shaped candies and bread loaves adorned with bread "bones."

This theme was also famously expressed in the works of the Mexican engraver [[José Guadalupe Posada]], in which people from various walks of life are depicted as skeletons.

[[File:Calavera_garbancera.png|thumb|[[José Guadalupe Posada|Posada's]] ''[[Calavera Garbancera]]'']]
Another manifestation of ''memento mori'' is found in the Mexican "Calavera", a literary composition in verse form normally written in honour of a person who is still alive, but written as if that person were dead. These compositions have a comedic tone and are often offered from one friend to another during [[Day of the Dead]].&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Brandes. "Skulls to the Living, Bread to the Dead: The Day of the Dead in Mexico and Beyond". Chapter 5: The Poetics of Death. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar concepts in other religions and cultures==
===In Buddhism===
The Buddhist practice [[Maranasati|''maraṇasati'']] meditates on death. The word is a Pāli compound of ''maraṇa'' 'death' (an Indo-European cognate of Latin ''mori'') and ''sati'' 'awareness', so very close to ''memento mori''. It is first used in early Buddhist texts, the [[Sutta Pitaka|suttapiṭaka]] of the [[Pāli Canon]], with parallels in the [[Āgama (Buddhism)|āgamas]] of the "Northern" Schools.

===In Japanese Zen and samurai culture===
In Japan, the influence of [[Zen]] Buddhist contemplation of death on indigenous culture can be gauged by the following quotation from the classic treatise on [[samurai]] ethics, ''[[Hagakure]]'':&lt;ref&gt;See a [http://themathesontrust.org/library/hagakure-book-of-the-samurai revised selection here].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Way of the Samurai is, morning after morning, the practice of death, considering whether it will be here or be there, imagining the most sightly way of dying, and putting one's mind firmly in death. Although this may be a most difficult thing, if one will do it, it can be done. There is nothing that one should suppose cannot be done.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.urbandharma.org/kusala/dad.html "A Buddhist Guide to Death, Dying and Suffering"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the annual appreciation of cherry blossom and fall colours, ''[[hanami]]'' and ''[[Leaf peeping|momijigari]]'', the samurai philosophised that things are most splendid at the moment before their fall, and to aim to live and die in a similar fashion.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

=== In Tibetan Buddhism ===
[[File:Tibetan Mask.jpg|thumb|Tibetan [[Citipati (Buddhism)|Citipati]] mask depicting [[Mahākāla]]. The skull mask of Citipati is a reminder of the impermanence of life and the eternal cycle of life and death.]]
In Tibetan Buddhism, there is a mind training practice known as [[Lojong]]. The initial stages of the classic Lojong begin with 'The Four Thoughts that Turn the Mind', or, more literally, 'Four Contemplations to Cause a Revolution in the Mind'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_thoughts&lt;/ref&gt; The second of these four is the contemplation on impermanence and death. In particular, one contemplates that; 
* All compounded things are impermanent. 
* The human body is a compounded thing. 
* Therefore, death of the body is certain. 
* The time of death is uncertain and beyond our control.

There are a number of classic verse formulations of these contemplations meant for daily reflection to overcome our strong habitual tendency to live as though we will certainly not die today.

==== Lalitavistara Sutra ====
The following is from the [[Lalitavistara Sūtra]], a major work in the classical Sanskrit canon:

अध्रुवं त्रिभवं शरदभ्रनिभं नटरङ्गसमा जगिर् ऊर्मिच्युती। गिरिनद्यसमं लघुशीघ्रजवं व्रजतायु जगे यथ विद्यु नभे॥
The three worlds are fleeting like autumn clouds. 
Like a staged performance, beings come and go. 
In tumultuous waves, rushing by, like rapids over a cliff. 
Like lightning, wanderers in samsara burst into existence, and are gone in a flash.

ज्वलितं त्रिभवं जरव्याधिदुखैः मरणाग्निप्रदीप्तमनाथमिदम्। भवनि शरणे सद मूढ जगत् भ्रमती भ्रमरो यथ कुम्भगतो॥
Beings are ablaze with the sufferings of sickness and old age, 
And with no defence against the conflagration of Death 
The bewildered, seeking refuge in worldly existence 
Spin round and round, like bees trapped in a jar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-046-001.html Lalitavistara Sutra]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Udānavarga ====
A very well known verse in the Pali, Sanskrit and Tibetan canons states [this is from the Sanskrit version, the Udānavarga:

सर्वे क्षयान्ता निचयाः पतनान्ताः समुच्छ्रयाः |
सम्योगा विप्रयोगान्ता मरणान्तं हि जीवितम् |1,22| 
All that is acquired will be lost
What rises will fall
Where there is meeting there will be separation
What is born will surely die.&lt;ref&gt;Udānavarga, 1:22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Shantideva, Bodhicaryavatara ====
[[Shantideva]], in the [[Bodhisattvacaryāvatāra]] 'Bodhisattva's Way of Life' reflects at length:

कृताकृतापरीक्षोऽयं मृत्युर्विश्रम्भघातकः।
स्वस्थास्वस्थैरविश्वास्य आकमिस्मकमहाशनि:॥ २/३४॥
Death does not differentiate between tasks done and undone.
This traitor is not to be trusted by the healthy or the ill, 
for it is like an unexpected, great thunderbolt. BCA 2.33

अप्रिया न भविष्यन्ति प्रियो मे न भविष्यति।
अहं च न भविष्यामि सर्वं च न भविष्यति॥२/३७॥
My enemies will not remain, nor will my friends remain.
I shall not remain. Nothing will remain. BCA 2:35

तत्तत्स्मरणताम याति यद्यद्वस्त्वनुभयते।
स्वप्नानुभूतवत्सर्वं गतं न पूनरीक्ष्यते॥२/३६॥
Whatever is experienced will fade to a memory. 
Like an experience in a dream, 
everything that has passed will not be seen again. BCA 2:36

रात्रिन्दिवमविश्राममायुषो वर्धते व्ययः।
आयस्य चागमो नास्ति न मरिष्यामि किं न्वहम्॥२/४०
Day and night, a life span unceasingly diminishes, 
and there is no adding onto it. Shall I not die then? BCA 2:39

यमदूतैर्गृहीतस्य कुतो बन्धुः कुतः सुह्रत्। पुण्यमेकं तदा त्राणं मया तच्च न सेवितम्॥२/४१॥
For a person seized by the messengers of Death, 
what good is a relative and what good is a friend? 
At that time, merit alone is a protection, 
and I have not applied myself to it. BCA 2:41

==== In more modern Tibetan Buddhist works====

In a practice text written by the 19th century Tibetan master '''[[Dudjom Lingpa]]''' for serious meditators, he formulates the second contemplation in this way.&lt;ref&gt;"Foolish Dharma of an Idiot Clothed in Mud and Feathers, in 'Dujdom Lingpa's Visions of the Great Perfection, Volume 1', B. Alan Wallace (translator), Wisdom Publications"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/natural-liberation&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Z7bVFdFdlEfoPdRSHHnXc&lt;/ref&gt; An oral commentary by the translator is available on YouTube here.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DPjVFPj32OoI&amp;usg=AOvVaw1yy8WwuFRkqWm5MKyD28-X&lt;/ref&gt;
''"On this occasion when you have such a bounty of opportunities in terms of your body, environment, friends, spiritual mentors, time, and practical instructions, without procrastinating until tomorrow and the next day, arouse a sense of urgency, as if a spark landed on your body or a grain of sand fell in your eye. If you have not swiftly applied yourself to practice, examine the births and deaths of other beings and reflect again and again on the unpredictability of your lifespan and the time of your death, and on the uncertainty of your own situation. Meditate on this until you have definitively integrated it with your mind... The appearances of this life, including your surroundings and friends, are like last night’s dream, and this life passes more swiftly than a flash of lightning in the sky. 
There is no end to this meaningless work. What a joke to prepare to live forever! 
Wherever you are born in the heights or depths of saṃsāra, the great noose of suffering will hold you tight. 
Acquiring freedom for yourself is as rare as a star in the daytime, so how is it possible to practice and achieve liberation? The root of all mind training and practical instructions is planted by knowing the nature of existence. There is no other way.I, an old vagabond, have shaken my beggar’s satchel, and this is what came out."''

The contemporary Tibetan master, '''Yangthang Rinpoche''', in his short text 'Summary of the View, Meditation, and Conduct':&lt;ref&gt;The English text is available [http://meridian-trust.org/meridian_site/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/A-Summary-of-the-View-Meditation-and-Conduct.pdf here.] The Tibetan text is available [http://www.lotsawahouse.org/bo/tibetan-masters/yangthang-rinpoche/view-meditation-action here.] Oral Commentary by a student of Rinpoche, B. Alan Wallace, is available [http://meridian-trust.org/video/a-summary-of-the-view-meditation-and-conduct-of-dzogchen-1-of-2-b-alan-wallace/ here.]&lt;/ref&gt;

You have obtained a human life, which is difficult to find,

Reflect again and again on the difficulty Of obtaining such a fine human life. 
If you do not make this meaningful, 
It will be like a butter lamp in the wind of impermanence. 
Do not count on this lasting a long time.''

The Tibetan Canon also includes copious materials on the meditative preparation for the death process and intermediate period [bardo] between death and rebirth. Amongst them are the famous "Tibetan Book of the Dead", in Tibetan ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'', the "Natural Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo".

===In Islam===
The "remembrance of death" ({{lang-ar|تذكرة الموت}}, ''Tadhkirat al-Mawt'') has been a major topic of Islamic spirituality (i.e. "tazkiya" meaning self-purification, or purification of the heart) since the time of the Prophet Muhammad in Medina. It is grounded in the [[Qur'an]], where there are recurring injunctions to pay heed to the fate of previous generations.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, sura "Yasin", 36:31, "Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which indeed returned not unto them?".&lt;/ref&gt; The [[hadith]] literature, which preserves the teachings of Prophet Muhammad, records advice for believers to "remember often death, the destroyer of pleasures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/riyadussaliheen/1/579|title=Hadith - The Book of Miscellany - Riyad as-Salihin -  Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Sufism|Sufis]] have been called "ahl al-qubur," the "people of the graves," because of their practice of frequenting graveyards to ponder on mortality and the vanity of life, based on the teaching of the Prophet Muhammad to visit graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnah.com/abudawud/21/147|title=Hadith - Book of Funerals (Kitab Al-Jana'iz) - Sunan Abi Dawud -  Sunnah.com - Sayings and Teachings of Prophet Muhammad (صلى الله عليه و سلم)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Ghazali]] devotes to this topic the last book of his "Revival of the Religious Sciences".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Ghazali on Death and the Afterlife, tr. by [[Timothy Winter|T.J.

'''Michael Andrew Fox''' {{post-nominals|OC}} (born June 9, 1961), known professionally as '''Michael J. Fox''', is a Canadian-American&lt;!-- Fox holds dual Canadian-US citizenship. --&gt; actor, author, film producer, activist and comedian with a film and television career spanning from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/michael-j-fox-q-a-1.4017957|title=Michael J.

Other notable roles have included [[Mike Flaherty (Deputy Mayor)|Mike Flaherty]] on the [[American Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Spin City]]'' (1996–2000) and his portrayal of [[Alex P. Keaton]] on the American sitcom ''[[Family Ties]]''. He has won five [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, four [[Golden Globe Awards]], a [[Grammy Award]] and two [[Screen Actors Guild Awards]].

Fox was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1991 at age 29, and disclosed his condition to the public in 1998. He partly retired from acting in 2000 as the symptoms of his disease worsened. He has since become an advocate for research toward finding a cure; he created the [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation|Michael J. Fox Foundation]], and Sweden's [[Karolinska Institutet]] gave him an ''honoris causa'' doctorate on March 5, 2010 for his work advocating a cure for Parkinson's disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b170318_michael_j_fox_gets_doctored.html |title=Michael J.

Since 1999, Fox has mainly worked as a voice-over actor in films such as ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]'' and [[Disney]]'s ''[[Atlantis: The Lost Empire]]''. On the [[CBS]] TV show ''[[The Good Wife]]'', he earned Emmy nominations for three consecutive years for his recurring role as crafty attorney Louis Canning.&lt;ref name="GoodWife"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bobbin|first1=Jay|title='The Good Wife' Season 5: Emmy nominee Michael J.

==Early life==
Michael Andrew Fox was born on June 9, 1961, in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]], Canada, to Phyllis (''née'' Piper), an actress/payroll clerk, and William Fox, a police officer and [[Canadian Forces]] member.&lt;ref name="actors"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Michael J.

Fox's family lived in various cities and towns across Canada because of his father's career.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Their family finally moved to [[Burnaby]], a large suburb of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], when his father retired in 1971. His father died on January 6, 1990, from a heart attack.&lt;ref name=MikeBio&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/michael-story.html |title=Michael J. Fox Biography |publisher=The Michael J Fox Foundation |date= |accessdate=August 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox attended [[Burnaby Central Secondary School]], and now has a theatre named for him at [[Burnaby South Secondary]].&lt;ref name="Burnaby" /&gt; At age 15, Fox starred in the Canadian television series ''[[Leo and Me]]'', produced by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and in 1979, at age 18, he moved to Los Angeles to further his acting career. Shortly after his marriage, he decided to move back to Vancouver.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; Fox is one of four members of the ''Leo and Me'' cast and crew who eventually developed Parkinson's disease in mid-life, an unusually high number that led to some investigation as to whether an environmental factor may have played a role.&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2002/apr/04/medicalscience.healthandwellbeing|title=Can you catch Parkinson's?|last=Atkins|first=Lucy|date=April 4, 2002|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=January 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rocca"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/64051_mjfox27ww.shtml|title=Michael J.

Fox was discovered by producer Ronald Shedlo and made his American television debut in the television film ''Letters from Frank'', credited under the name "Michael Fox." He intended to continue to use the name, but when he registered with the [[Screen Actors Guild]], which requires unique registration names to avoid credit ambiguities (and the possibility that royalty checks would be sent to the wrong actors), he discovered that [[Michael Fox (American actor)|Michael Fox]], a veteran [[character actor]], was already registered under the name.&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt; As he explained in his autobiography, ''Lucky Man: A Memoir'' and in interviews, he needed to come up with a different name. He did not like the sound of "Michael A. Fox" during a time when "fox" was coming to mean "attractive" and because his middle initial sounded too much like the [[Eh#Canada|Canadian "eh?"]] He also didn't like the sound of "Andrew" or "Andy," so he decided to adopt a new middle initial and settled on "J," as a tribute to actor [[Michael J. Pollard]].&lt;ref name=MikeBio /&gt;

==Acting career==

Fox|work=Television Academy}}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1988 shortly after they were married]]

Fox's first feature film roles were ''[[Midnight Madness (film)|Midnight Madness]]'' (1980) and ''[[Class of 1984]]'' (1982), credited in both as Michael Fox. Shortly afterward, he began playing "Young Republican" [[Alex P. Keaton]] in the show ''[[Family Ties]]'', which aired on [[NBC]] for seven seasons from 1982–89. In an interview with [[Jimmy Fallon]] in April 2014, Fox stated he negotiated the role at a payphone at [[Pioneer Chicken]]. He received the role only after [[Matthew Broderick]] was unavailable.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; ''Family Ties'' had been sold to the television network using the pitch "[[Hip (slang)|Hip]] parents, [[Square (slang)|square]] kids",&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite web|last=Haglund |first=David |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/dvdextras/2007/03/reagans_favorite_sitcom.single.html |title=Reagan's Favorite Sitcom: How Family Ties spawned a conservative hero |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=January 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the parents originally intended to be the main characters. However, the positive reaction to Fox's performance led to his character becoming the focus of the show following the fourth episode.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; At its peak, the audience for ''Family Ties'' drew one-third of America's households every week.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; Fox won three [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] awards for ''Family Ties'' in 1986, 1987, and 1988.&lt;ref name="Emmy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/award_history_search?person=michael+j+fox&amp;program=&amp;start_year=0&amp;end_year=2010&amp;network=All&amp;web_category=All&amp;winner=All|title=EMMY Award History|date=|publisher=EMMY Official Website|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="globes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.com/person/michael-j-fox|title=Golden Globe Awards for Michael J. Fox|date=|publisher=Golden Globes Official Website|accessdate=April 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brandon Tartikoff]], one of the show's producers, felt that Fox was too short in relation to the actors playing his parents, and tried to have him replaced. Tartikoff reportedly said that "this is not the kind of face you'll ever find on a lunch-box." After his later successes, Fox presented Tartikoff with a custom-made lunch-box with the inscription "To Brandon, this is for you to put your [[eating crow|crow in]]. Love and Kisses, Michael J. Fox." Tartikoff kept the lunch-box in his office for the rest of his NBC career.&lt;ref name="LuckyMan"&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

While filming ''Family Ties'', Fox met his wife, [[Tracy Pollan]], who portrayed his girlfriend, Ellen.&lt;ref name="actors" /&gt; When Fox left the TV series ''[[Spin City]]'', his final episodes made numerous allusions to ''Family Ties'': [[Michael Gross (actor)|Michael Gross]] (who played Alex's father Steven) portrays Mike Flaherty's (Fox's character's) therapist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/mar/20/entertainment/ca-10674 |title=Putting His Own Spin on 'City's' Season Finale |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=March 20, 2000 |accessdate=August 23, 2010 | first=Amy | last=Wallace}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is a reference to an off-screen character named "[[Justine Bateman|Mallory]]".&lt;ref&gt;Shales, Tom. "Michael J. Fox, Playing 'Spin City' to a Fare-Thee-Well". ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 24, 2000, C1.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, when Flaherty becomes an environmental [[lobbyist]] in Washington, D.C., he meets a conservative senator from [[Ohio]] named Alex P. Keaton, and in one episode [[Meredith Baxter]] played Mike's mother.

As a consequence of working in ''Family Ties'', as well as his acting in ''Teen Wolf'' and ''Back to the Future'', Fox became a [[teen idol]]. [[VH1]]'s show ''The Greatest'' later naming him among their "50 Greatest Teen Idols."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=67297|title = Episode 080: 50 Greatest Teen Idols|website = VH1|accessdate = October 21, 2015|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120209143618/http://www.vh1.com/shows/the_greatest/episode.jhtml?episodeID=67297|archivedate = February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film career===
[[File:Michael J Fox 1988-cropped1.jpg|thumb|upright|Fox at the [[40th Primetime Emmy Awards]] in August 1988]]

In January 1985, Fox was cast to replace [[Eric Stoltz]] as [[Marty McFly]], a teenager who is accidentally sent [[Time travel|back in time]] from 1985 to 1955 in ''[[Back to the Future]]''.
[[Robert Zemeckis]], the director, originally wanted Fox to play Marty, but [[Gary David Goldberg]] the creator of ''[[Family Ties]]'', which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as [[Meredith Baxter]] was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character [[Alex Keaton]] was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming ''Back to the Future'', but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved.&lt;ref name="Making"&gt;"Back to the Future: Making the Trilogy: Chapter 1 (DVD Documentary)"&lt;/ref&gt; Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open with the return of Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall in ''[[Once Bitten (1985 film)|Once Bitten]]'', but it eventually went to [[Jim Carrey]]. During filming, Fox would rehearse for ''Family Ties'' from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the ''Back to the Future'' set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. ''Back to the Future'' was both a commercial and critical success.

During and immediately after the [[Back to the Future trilogy|''Back to the Future'' trilogy]], Fox starred in ''[[Teen Wolf]]'' (1985),'' [[Light of Day]]'' (1987), ''[[The Secret of My Success (1987 film)|The Secret of My Success]]'' (1987), ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'' (1988), and ''[[Casualties of War]]'' (1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ws5CDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2016-IA67&amp;lpg=PA2016-IA67&amp;dq=after+the+Back+to+the+Future+trilogy,+Fox+starred+in+Teen+Wolf+(1985),+Light+of+Day+(1987),+The+Secret+of+My+Success+(1987),+Bright+Lights,+Big+City+(1988),+and+Casualties+of+War+(1989).#v=onepage&amp;q=after%20the%20Back%20to%20the%20Future%20trilogy,%20Fox%20starred%20in%20Teen%20Wolf%20(1985),%20Light%20of%20Day%20(1987),%20The%20Secret%20of%20My%20Success%20(1987),%20Bright%20Lights,%20Big%20City%20(1988),%20and%20Casualties%20of%20War%20(1989).&amp;f=false|title=Focus On: 100 Most Popular Canadian Male Film Actors|last=contributors|first=Wikipedia|publisher=e-artnow sro|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Secret of My Success'', Fox played a recent graduate from [[Kansas State University]] who moves to New York City, where he has to deal with the ups and downs of the business world. The film was successful at the box office, grossing $110 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=secretofmysuccess.htm |title=The Secret of My Success Box Office Mojo |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] in ''The Chicago Sun Times'' wrote; "Fox provides a fairly desperate center for the film. It could not have been much fun for him to follow the movie's arbitrary shifts of mood, from sitcom to slapstick, from sex farce to boardroom brawls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870410/REVIEWS/704100301 |title=The Secret of My Success Review |work=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=April 10, 1987 |accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Bright Lights, Big City (film)|Bright Lights, Big City]]'', Fox played a fact-checker for a New York magazine, who spends his nights partying with alcohol and drugs. The film received mixed reviews, with Hal Hinson in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' criticizing Fox by claiming that "he was the wrong actor for the job".&lt;ref name="hinson"&gt;{{cite news | last = Hinson | first = Hal | title = ''City'' Blight | work = Washington Post | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = | accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Roger Ebert praised the actor's performance: "Fox is very good in the central role (he has a long drunken monologue that is the best thing he has ever done in a movie)".&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;{{cite news | last = Ebert | first = Roger | title = ''Bright Lights, Big City'' | work = [[Chicago Sun-Times]] | pages = | date = April 1, 1988 | url = http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19880401/REVIEWS/804010301/1023 | accessdate = June 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the shooting of ''Bright Lights, Big City'', Fox co-starred again with [[Tracy Pollan]], his on-screen girlfriend from ''[[Family Ties]]''.

Fox then starred in ''[[Casualties of War]]'', a dark and violent war drama about the [[Vietnam War]], alongside [[Sean Penn]]. ''Casualties of War'' was not a major box office hit, but Fox, playing a private serving in [[Vietnam]], received good reviews for his performance. Don Willmott on film critic's website wrote; "Fox, only one year beyond his ''[[Family Ties]]'' sitcom silliness, rises to the challenges of acting as the film's moral voice and sharing scenes with the always intimidating Penn."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1989/casualties-of-war/ |title=Casualties of War Review |publisher=Film Critic Website |date=January 4, 2006 |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113234717/http://www.filmcritic.com/reviews/1989/casualties-of-war/ |archivedate=November 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, he starred in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'', a romantic comedy about a talented medical doctor who decides to become a plastic surgeon. While moving from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles, he winds up as a doctor in a small southern town in South Carolina. [[Michael Caton-Jones]], from ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'', described Fox in the film as "at his frenetic best".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65559/doc_hollywood.html |title=Doc Hollywood Review |work=Time Out |date= |accessdate=September 1, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118081240/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/65559/doc_hollywood.html |archivedate=November 18, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hard Way (1991 film)|The Hard Way]]'' was also released in 1991, with Fox playing an undercover actor learning from police officer [[James Woods]]. After being privately diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 1991 and being cautioned he had "ten good working years left", Fox hastily signed a three-film contract, appearing in ''[[For Love or Money (1993 film)|For Love or Money]]'' (1993), ''[[Life With Mikey]]'' (1993), and ''[[Greedy (film)|Greedy]]'' (1994).  The mid-1990s saw Fox play smaller supporting roles in ''[[The American President]]'' (1995) and ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'' (1996).&lt;ref name="actors"/&gt;

His last major film role was in ''[[The Frighteners]]'' (1996), directed by [[Peter Jackson]]. ''[[The Frighteners]]'' tells the story of Frank Bannister (Fox), an architect who develops psychic abilities allowing him to see, hear, and communicate with ghosts. After losing his wife, he uses his new abilities by cheating customers out of money for his "ghost hunting" business. However, a [[mass murder]]er comes back from Hell, prompting Frank to investigate the supernatural presence. Fox's performance received critical praise, [[Kenneth Turan]] in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote; "The film's actors are equally pleasing. Both Fox, in his most successful starring role in some time, and [Trini] [[Trini Alvarado|Alvarado]], who looks rather like Andie MacDowell here, have no difficulty getting into the manic spirit of things."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960719-3,0,6464899.story |title=The Frighteners Review |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=July 19, 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031053608/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie960719-3%2C0%2C6464899.story |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |accessdate=May 18, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[NPR]] in April 2002,&lt;ref name="NPR Fresh Air"/&gt; Fox explained what he does when he becomes symptomatic during an interview:

{{Quote|quote = Well, actually, I've been erring on the side of caution—I think 'erring' is actually the right word—in that I've been medicating perhaps too much, in the sense [that] ... the symptoms ... people see in some of these interviews that [I] have been on are actually [[dyskinesia]], which is a reaction to the medication. Because if I were purely symptomatic with Parkinson's symptoms, a lot of times speaking is difficult. There's a kind of a [[cluttering]] of speech and it's very difficult to sit still, to sit in one place. You know, the symptoms are different, so I'd rather kind of suffer the symptoms of dyskinesia... this kind of weaving and this kind of continuous thing is much preferable, actually, than pure Parkinson's symptoms. So that's what I generally do... I haven't had any, you know, problems with pure Parkinson's symptoms in any of these interviews, because I'll tend to just make sure that I have enough [[Sinemet]] in my system and, in some cases, too much. But to me, it's preferable. It's not representative of what I'm like in my everyday life. I get a lot of people with Parkinson's coming up to me saying, 'You take too much medication.' I say, 'Well, you sit across from [[Larry King]] and see if you want to tempt it.'

 |quote = As you might know, I care deeply about stem cell research. In Missouri, you can elect Claire McCaskill, who shares my hope for cures. Unfortunately, Senator Jim Talent opposes expanding stem cell research. Senator Talent even wanted to criminalize the science that gives us the chance for hope. They say all politics is local, but that's not always the case. What you do in Missouri matters to millions of Americans, Americans like me.

[[File:Bharat Mata.jpg|right|thumb|''Bharat Mata'' by [[Abanindranath Tagore]] (1871–1951), a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]], and a pioneer of the movement]]
The '''modern Indian art''' movement in [[Indian painting]] is considered to have begun in [[Calcutta]] in the late nineteenth century.The old traditions of painting had more or less died out in Bengal and new schools of art were started by the British.&lt;ref name="Bhattacharya1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhattacharya|first=Sunil Kumar|title=Trends in modern Indian art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SIs5qkjljpQC|accessdate=14 December 2011|date=1 January 1994|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=978-81-85880-21-1|pages=7–11|chapter=2. Revivalism and the Impact of the West}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, protagonists of Indian art such as [[Raja Ravi Varma]] drew on Western traditions and techniques including oil paint and easel painting. A reaction to the Western influence led to a revival in primitivism, called as the [[Bengal school of art]], which drew from the rich cultural heritage of India. It was succeeded by the [[Santiniketan]] school, led by [[Rabindranath Tagore]]'s harking back to idyllic rural folk and rural life. Despite its country-wide influence in the early years, the importance of the School declined by the 'forties' and now it is as good as dead. 

==British art schools==
Oil and easel painting In India began in the starting of eighteenth century which saw many European artists, such as [[Johann Zoffany|Zoffany]], [[Tilly Kettle|Kettle]], [[William Hodges|Hodges]], [[Thomas Daniell|Thomas]] and [[William Daniell]], [[Joshua Reynolds]], [[Emily Eden]] and [[George Chinnery]] coming out to India in search of fame and fortune.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kapur|first=Geeta|editor=Turner, Caroline|title=Art and social change: contemporary art in Asia and the Pacific|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lYmfAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=2005|publisher=Pandanus Books, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, the Australian National University|isbn=978-1-74076-046-1|pages=146–163|chapter=A Stake in Modernity – A Brief History of Modern Indian Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; The courts of the [[princely state]]s of India were an important draw for European artists due to their patronage of the visual and performing arts and also their need for European style of portraits

The merchants of the [[East India Company]] also provided a large market for native art. A distinct genre developed of watercolour painting on paper and mica in the later half of the 18th century depicting scenes of everyday life, regalia of princely courts, and native festivities and rituals. Referred to as the "[[Company style]]" or "Patna style", it flourished at first in Murshidabad and spread to other cities of British suzerainty. The style is considered by authorities to be "of hybrid style and undistinguished quality".&lt;ref name="Educational2010"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Kuiper, Kathleen|title=The Culture of India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LiqloV4JnNUC&amp;pg=PA230|accessdate=10 February 2012|date=1 July 2010|publisher=The Rosen Publishing Group &amp; Britannica Educational Publishing|isbn=978-1-61530-203-1|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-1857, [[John Griffiths (artist)|John Griffiths]] and [[John Lockwood Kipling]] (father of [[Rudyard Kipling]]) came out to India together; Griffith going on to head the [[Sir J. J. School of Art]] and being considered as one of the finest Victorian painters to come to India and Kipling went on to head both the J. J. School of Art and the [[Mayo School of Arts]] established in [[Lahore]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TOI05102007"&gt;{{cite news |title=Kipling house to become museum |author= |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-10-05/mumbai/27989345_1_kipling-house-bungalow-jsw-foundation |newspaper=Times of India |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enlightened eighteenth-century attitude shown by an earlier generation of British towards Indian history, monuments, literature, culture and art took a turn away in the mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Baron2001"&gt;{{cite book |title=An Indian Affair – From Riches to Raj |last=Baron |first=Archie |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2001 |publisher=Channel Books |location= |isbn=978-0-7522-6160-7|page=194 |pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Previous manifestations of Indian art were brushed away as being "dead" and the stuff of museums; "from the official British perspective, India had no living art".&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/arts/design/20bose.html |title=Indian Modernism via an Eclectic and Elusive Artist |author=Cotter, Holland |date=19 August 2008  |work=New York Times |publisher= |accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To propagate Western values in art education and the colonial agenda, the British established art schools in Calcutta and Madras in 1854 and in Bombay in 1857.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;

==Raja Ravi Varma==
[[Raja Ravi Varma]]  (1848–1906) was a remarkable self-taught [[India]]n [[Painting|painter]] from the [[princely state]] of [[Travancore]]. His exposure in the west came when he won the first prize in the [[Vienna]] Art Exhibition in 1873. Varma's paintings were also sent to the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] held in Chicago in 1893 and his work was awarded two gold medals.&lt;ref&gt;Kilimanoor Chandran, ''Ravi Varmayum Chitrakalayum''(in Malayalam), Department of Culture, Kerala, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered the first of the modernists, and, along with [[Amrita Sher-gil]] (1913–1941), the main exponents of Western techniques to develop a new aesthetic in the subjective interpretation of Indian culture with "the promise of materiality in the medium of oils and the reality-paradigm of the mirror/window format of easel painting".&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Some other prominent Indian painters born in the 19th century are [[M. V. Dhurandhar|Mahadev Vishwanath Dhurandhar]] (1867–1944), [[A X Trindade]] (1870–1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Nalini Bhagwat |url=http://www.indiaart.com/Articles-and-Features/Articles-on-A-X-Trindade-by-Nalini-Bhagwat/Articles-on-A-X-Trindade-by-Nalini-Bhagwat.asp |title=Old Master A. X. Trindade – Article by Dr. Nalini Bhagwat, A Rembrandt of the east, painter, landscapes, Portrait, pastels and water colours painting, simple minded soul |publisher=Indiaart.com |date=1935-03-16 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[M F Pithawalla]] (1872–1937),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goaartgallery.com/pithawala_m_f.htm |title=Artist Gellary – M F PITHAWALA |publisher=Goaartgallery.com |date=2007-03-19 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sawlaram Haldankar|Sawlaram Lakshman Haldankar]] (1882–1968) and [[Hemen Majumdar]] (1894–1948).

The work of Varma was considered to be among the best examples of the fusion of Indian traditions with the techniques of European [[academic art]], in the colonial-nationalistic framework of the 19th century. He is most remembered for his paintings of beautiful [[sari]]-clad [[women]], who were portrayed as shapely and graceful. Varma became the best-known allegorist of Indian subjects in his depiction of scenes from the [[Epic poetry|epics]] of the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Ramayana]].

Raja Ravi Varma considered his work as "establishing a new civilisational identity within the terms of 19th Century India".&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;{{rp|147}} He aimed to form an Indian canton of art in the manner of those of the classic Greek and Roman civilisations.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Varma's art came to play an important role in the development of the Indian national consciousness. Varma purchased a printing press which churned out oleograph copies of his paintings which graced the middle-class homes of India, many decades after he died.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Considered a genius in his heydey, within a few years of his passing, Varma's paintings came under severe strictures for mimicking Western art.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Raja Ravi Varma died in 1906 at the age of 58. He is considered among the greatest painters in [[Indian art|the history of Indian art]].

==The Bengal School==
{{main|Bengal School of Art}}
During the colonial era, Western influences had started to make an impact on Indian art. Some artists developed a style that used Western ideas of composition, perspective and realism to illustrate Indian themes, [[Raja Ravi Varma]] being prominent among them.&lt;ref name="Mitter1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitter|first=Partha|title=Art and nationalism in colonial India, 1850–1922: occidental orientations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mRTtkri8E0C&amp;pg=PA179|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-44354-8|pages=179–215|chapter=5 – The Artist as Charismatic Individual – Raja Ravi Varma}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bengal school arose as an [[avant garde]] and nationalist movement reacting against the [[academic art]] styles previously promoted in India, both by Indian artists such as Varma and in British art schools.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt;

Following the widespread influence of Indian spiritual ideas in the [[Western world|West]], the British art teacher [[Ernest Binfield Havel]] attempted to reform the teaching methods at the [[Calcutta School of Art]] by encouraging students to imitate [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] miniatures.&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt;
This caused immense controversy, leading to a strike by students and complaints from the local press, including from nationalists who considered it to be a retrogressive move.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Havel was supported by the artist [[Abanindranath Tagore]], a nephew of the poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]].&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt;

Abanindranath painted a number of works influenced by Mughal art, a style that he and Havel believed to be expressive of India's distinct spiritual qualities, as opposed to the "materialism" of the West. His best-known painting, ''Bharat Mata'' (Mother India), depicted a young woman, portrayed with four arms in the manner of Hindu deities, holding objects symbolic of India's national aspirations. The other prominent figures of the [[Bengal school of art]] were [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], Abanindranath's elder brother, [[Jamini Roy]], [[Mukul Dey]], [[Manishi Dey]] and [[Ram Kinker Baij]], who is more famous as the pioneer of Modern Indian Sculpture. Another important figure of this era was [[Chittaprosad Bhattacharya]], who rejected the classicism of the Bengal School and its spiritual preoccupations.&lt;ref name=multi2&gt;''Manifestations II'', Rabina Karode, Delhi Art Gallery 2004, {{ISBN|81-902104-0-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''Hungry Bengal : a tour through Midnapur District'' included many sketches of the Bengal Famine drawn from life, as well as documentation of the persons depicted. The book was immediately banned by the British and 5000 copies were seized and destroyed. Only one copy was hidden by Chittaprosad's family and is now in the possession of the Delhi Art Gallery.

During the opening years of the 20th century, Abanindranath developed links with Japanese cultural figures such as the art historian [[Okakura Kakuzō]] and the painter [[Yokoyama Taikan]] as part of a globalised [[Modernism|Modernist]] initiative with [[pan-Asianism|pan-Asian]] tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;Arrowsmith, Rupert Richard.

Those associated with this Indo-Far Eastern model included [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], Vinayak Shivaram Masoji, [[B.C. Sanyal]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], and subsequently their students [[A. Ramachandran]], Tan Yuan Chameli, and a few others. The Bengal school's influence on Indian art scene gradually started alleviating with the spread of [[modernist]] ideas post-independence.

==Santiniketan==
The mantle of the Bengal School was taken up when Rabindranath Tagore established the visionary university of [[Santiniketan]], a university focussed on the preservation and upliftment of Indian culture, values and heritage.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; It included an art school "[[Kala Bhavan]]" founded in 1920–21.

One of the early students of Abanindranath Tagore was [[Nandalal Bose]], who subsequently became a teacher and later the Director for art.&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt; Nandalal led the school to a position of pre-eminence in the nationalistic ideology now emerging in Indian culture. The Shantiniketan school of thought emphasised that "an aesthetic was also an ethos, that art’s role was more than life-enhancing, it was world-shaping".&lt;ref name="Cotter2008"/&gt; It established an Indian version of naturalism distinct from the oriental and western schools, one example being the eschewing of oil and easel painting for work on paper drawn/coloured using watercolours, wash, tempera and ink.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Rabindranath Tagore's dream of veneration of old values, typified by motifs such as rural folk, especially [[Santhal people|Santhal]] tribals, came to fruition in the art-related schools of [[Viswa-Bharati University]] at Santiniketan.&lt;ref name="Turner2005"/&gt; Some of the prominent artists of Santiniketan school are [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], Ramkinkar Baij, Shanko Chowdhury,  Dinkar Kowshik, [[K. G. Subramanyan]], [[Beohar Rammanohar Sinha]], Krishna Reddy, A Ramachandran, Shobha Brhma, Ramananda Bandhapadhyay, Dharma Narayan Dasgupta, Sushen Ghose,  Janak Jhankar Narzary .

===Contextual Modernism===
{{main|Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism}}
[[File:Professor R. Siva Kumar.jpg|thumb|art historian [[R. Siva Kumar]]]]
The idea of [[Contextual Modernism]] emerged in 1997 from [[R. Siva Kumar]]'s [[Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism]] as a [[postcolonial]] critical tool in the understanding of an alternative [[modernism]] in the visual arts of the erstwhile colonies like India, specifically that of the Santiniketan artists.

Several terms including [[Paul Gilroy]]’s ''counter culture of modernity'' and [[Tani Barlow]]'s ''Colonial modernity'' have been used to describe the kind of alternative modernity that emerged in non-European contexts. Professor Gall argues that ‘Contextual Modernism’ is a more suited term because "the colonial in ''colonial modernity'' does not accommodate the refusal of many in colonized situations to internalize inferiority. Santiniketan’s artist teachers’ refusal of subordination incorporated a counter vision of modernity, which sought to correct the racial and cultural essentialism that drove and characterized imperial Western modernity and modernism. Those European modernities, projected through a triumphant British colonial power, provoked nationalist responses, equally problematic when they incorporated similar essentialisms."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huichawaii.org/assets/gall,-david---overcoming-polarized-modernities.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[R. Siva Kumar]] "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt; He had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 80s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was, according to Siva Kumar, misleading. ''This happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice''.&lt;ref name="humanitiesunderground.org"/&gt;

''Contextual Modernism'' in the recent past has found its usage in other related fields of studies, specially in [[Architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:444711&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-independence==
By the time of Independence in 1947, several schools of art in India provided access to modern techniques and ideas. Galleries were established to showcase these artists. Modern Indian art typically shows the influence of Western styles, but is often inspired by Indian themes and images. Major artists are beginning to gain international recognition, initially among the Indian diaspora, but also among non-Indian audiences.

The [[Progressive Artists' Group]], established shortly after India became independent in 1947, was intended to establish new ways of expressing India in the post-colonial era. Its founder was [[Francis Newton Souza]] and [[S. H. Raza]], [[M. F. Husain]] and [[Manishi Dey]] were early members. It was profoundly influential in changing the idiom of Indian art. Almost all of the major artists of India in the 1950s were associated with the group. Prominent among them were [[Akbar Padamsee]], [[Sadanand Bakre]], [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[K. H. Ara]], [[H. A. Gade]] and Bal Chabda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ngmaindia.gov.in/sh-pag.asp |title=Showcase – Artists Collectives |publisher=National Gallery of Modern Art, New Delhi |date=2012-11-09 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, [[Vasudeo S. Gaitonde|V. S. Gaitonde]], [[Krishen Khanna]] and [[Mohan Samant]] joined the Group. The group disbanded in 1956.

Women artists like [[B. Prabha]], [[Shanu Lahiri]], [[Arpita Singh]], [[Anjolie Ela Menon]] and [[Lalita Lajmi]] have made immense contributions to Modern Indian Art and Painting. Art historians like Prof. Rai [[Anand Krishna]] have also referred to those works of modern artistes that reflect Indian ethos. Some of the acclaimed contemporary Indian artists include [[Nagasamy Ramachandran]], [[Jitish Kallat]], [[Atul Dodiya]] and [[Geeta Vadhera]]  who has had acclaim in translating complex, Indian spiritual themes onto canvas like Sufi thought, the Upanishads and the Bhagwad Geeta.

Indian Art got a boost with the economic liberalization of the country since early 1990s. Artists from various fields now started bringing in varied styles of work. Post liberalization Indian art works not only within the confines of academic traditions but also outside it. Artists have introduced new concepts which have hitherto not been seen in Indian art. [[Devajyoti Ray]] has introduced a new genre of art called [[Pseudorealism]]. Pseudorealist Art is an original art style that has been developed entirely on the Indian soil. Pseudorealism takes into account the Indian concept of abstraction and uses it to transform regular scenes of Indian life into fantastic images.

In post-liberalization India, many artists have established themselves in the international art market like the [[Abstract art|abstract painter]] [[Natvar Bhavsar]], abstract Art painter [[Nabakishore Chanda]], and sculptor [[Anish Kapoor]] whose mammoth [[postminimalist]] artworks have acquired attention for their sheer size. Many art houses and galleries have also opened in USA and Europe to showcase Indian artworks.

'''''Moments of Being''''' is a collection of posthumously-published autobiographical essays by [[Virginia Woolf]].  The collection was first found in the papers of her husband, used by [[Quentin Bell]] in his biography of Virginia Woolf, published in 1972.  In 1976, the essays were edited for publication by Jeanne Schulkind.  The second edition was published in 1985.  The original texts are now housed at [[Sussex University]] and in the [[British Library]] in [[London]].

==Title==
The title for the collection was chosen by its original editor, Jeanne Schulkind, based on a passage from "A Sketch of the Past". As described by Woolf, 'moments of being' are moments in which an individual experiences a sense of reality, in contrast to the states of 'non-being' that dominate most of an individual's conscious life, in which they are separated from reality by a protective covering. Moments of being could be a result of instances of shock, discovery, or revelation.

==Contents==
''Moments of Being'' consists of five autobiographical essays:
#"Reminiscences" (1907)
#"[[A Sketch of the Past]]" (1939-40)
#"22 Hyde Park Gate" (1920–1)
#"Old Bloomsbury" (1921–2)
#"Am I a Snob?" (1936)

"22 Hyde Park Gate", "Old Bloomsbury" and "Am I a Snob?" were written for the Memoir Club, a group formed in 1920 by [[Molly MacCarthy]] which met to present honest autobiographical papers.

Art exhibits are considered '''off-site''' if they are presented outside the traditional venues of museums, art galleries or other cultural institutions. This does not necessarily mean the work is uncurated, or created outside of an institutional collaboration. Artwork may be shown off-site simply because it is [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] work. But more specifically the term implies a project that is considered too avant-garde or too unconventional to be shown in a gallery situation.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter-Smith, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kermode, off-site projects are
:"... by their very nature artistic gestures that have continuity with non-art environments, art that circumvents gallery space - usually detached and abstract - and goes straight to a public that often has little or no direct experience of art, thus democratizing ''aesthetic opportunities''."&lt;ref&gt;Kermode, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 006.jpg|thumb|300px|[[James Abbot McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne: Blue and Gold – Old Battersea Bridge]]'' (1872), [[Tate Britain]], London, England]]
'''Realism''' was an artistic movement that began in France in the 1850s, after the [[French Revolution of 1848|1848 Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Realists rejected [[Romanticism]], which had dominated French literature and art since the late 18th century.  Realism revolted against the exotic subject matter and the exaggerated emotionalism and drama of the Romantic movement. Instead, it sought to portray real and typical contemporary people and situations with truth and accuracy, and not avoiding unpleasant or sordid aspects of life. Realist works depicted people of all classes in situations that arise in ordinary life, and often reflected the changes brought by the [[Industrial Revolution|Industrial]] and [[Commercial Revolution]]s. The popularity of such "realistic" works grew with the introduction of [[photography]]—a new visual source that created a desire for people to produce representations which look objectively real.

The Realists depicted everyday subjects and situations in contemporary settings, and attempted to depict individuals of all social classes in a similar manner. Classical idealism and Romantic emotionalism and drama were avoided equally, and often sordid or untidy elements of subjects were not smoothed over or omitted. Social realism emphasizes the depiction of the working class, and treating them with the same seriousness as other classes in art, but realism, as the avoidance of artificiality, in the treatment of human relations and emotions was also an aim of Realism. Treatments of subjects in a heroic or sentimental manner were equally rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Finocchio, Ross. "Nineteenth-Century French Realism". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm online] (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Realism as an art movement was led by [[Gustave Courbet]] in France. It spread across Europe and was influential for the rest of the century and beyond, but as it became adopted into the mainstream of painting it becomes less common and useful as a term to define artistic style. After the arrival of [[Impressionism]] and later movements which downgraded the importance of precise illusionistic brushwork, it often came to refer simply to the use of a more traditional and tighter painting style. It has been used for a number of later movements and trends in art, some involving careful illusionistic representation, such as [[Photorealism]], and others the depiction of "realist" subject matter in a social sense, or attempts at both.

[[File:Gustave Courbet 010.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Bonjour, Monsieur Courbet]]'', 1854. A Realist painting by [[Gustave Courbet]].]]
The Realist movement began in the mid-19th century as a reaction to [[Romanticism]] and [[History painting]]. In favor of depictions of 'real' life, the Realist painters used common laborers, and ordinary people in ordinary surroundings engaged in real activities as subjects for their works. The chief exponents of Realism were [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Honoré Daumier]], and [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm NGA Realism movement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144138/http://www.nga.gov/collection/sfp/noflash/realism/1941_6_1.htm |date=2014-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/glossary/realist-movement National Gallery glossary, Realism movement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://impressionist1877.tripod.com/realism.htm Philosophy of Realism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jules Bastien-Lepage]] is closely associated with the beginning of ''Naturalism'', an artistic style that emerged from the later phase of the Realist movement and heralded the arrival of [[Impressionism]].&lt;ref name=Fry&gt;Fry, Roger. 1920.

Realists used unprettified detail depicting the existence of ordinary contemporary life, coinciding in the contemporaneous naturalist literature of [[Émile Zola]], [[Honoré de Balzac]], and [[Gustave Flaubert]].&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/rlsm/hd_rlsm.htm Nineteenth-Century French Realism | Essay | Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History | The Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courbet was the leading proponent of Realism and he challenged the popular [[history painting]] that was favored at the state-sponsored art academy.
His groundbreaking paintings ''[[A Burial at Ornans]]'' and ''[[The Stonebreakers]]'' depicted ordinary people from his native region. Both paintings were done on huge canvases that would typically be used for history paintings.&lt;ref name="metmuseum1"/&gt; Although Courbet's early works emulated the sophisticated manner of Old Masters such as [[Rembrandt]] and [[Titian]], after 1848 he adopted a boldly inelegant style inspired by [[popular print]]s, shop signs, and other work of folk artisans.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; In ''The Stonebreakers'', his first painting to create a controversy, Courbet eschewed the pastoral tradition of representing human subjects in harmony with nature. Rather, he depicted two men juxtaposed against a charmless, stony roadside. The concealment of their faces emphasizes the dehumanizing nature of their monotonous, repetitive labor.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

== Beyond France ==

The French Realist movement had stylistic and ideological equivalents in all other Western countries, developing somewhat later. The Realist movement in France was characterized by a spirit of rebellion against powerful official support for history painting. In countries where institutional support of history painting was less dominant, the transition from existing traditions of [[genre art|genre painting]] to Realism presented no such schism.&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin, J. 2003. "Realism". ''Grove Art Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; An important Realist movement beyond France was the [[Peredvizhniki]] or ''Wanderers'' group in Russia who formed in the 1860s and organized exhibitions from 1871 included many realists such as genre artist [[Vasily Perov]], [[landscape art|landscape]] artists [[Ivan Shishkin]], [[Alexei Savrasov]], and [[Arkhip Kuindzhi]], portraitist [[Ivan Kramskoy]], [[war artist]] [[Vasily Vereshchagin]], historical artist [[Vasily Surikov]] and, especially, [[Ilya Repin]], who is considered by many to be the most renowned Russian artist of the 19th century. 

Courbet's influence was felt most strongly in Germany, where prominent realists included [[Adolph Menzel]], [[Wilhelm Leibl]], [[Wilhelm Trübner]], and [[Max Liebermann]]. Leibl and several other young German painters met Courbet in 1869 when he visited Munich to exhibit his works and demonstrate his manner of painting from nature.&lt;ref&gt;Nationalgalerie (Berlin), and Françoise Forster-Hahn. 2001. ''Spirit of an Age: Nineteenth-Century Paintings From the Nationalgalerie, Berlin''. London: National Gallery Company. p. 155. {{ISBN|1857099605}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the artists of the [[Macchiaioli]] group painted Realist scenes of rural and urban life. The [[Hague School]] were Realists in the Netherlands whose style and subject matter strongly influenced the early works of [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt; In Britain artists such as the American [[James Abbot McNeill Whistler]], as well as English artists [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Hubert von Herkomer]] and [[Luke Fildes]] had great success with realist paintings dealing with social issues and depictions of the "real" world. 

In the United States, [[Winslow Homer]] and [[Thomas Eakins]] were important Realists and forerunners of the [[Ashcan School]], an early-20th-century art movement largely based in [[New York City]]. The Ashcan School included such artists as [[George Bellows]] and [[Robert Henri]], and helped to define [[American realism]] in its tendency to depict the daily life of poorer members of society.

==Response==
''[[The Portland Mercury]]'' described the format of ''Rendered'' in an article about Portland podcasts: "Destination DIY goes beyond the crafts 'n' home repair often associated with the term 'DIY' to encompass anything people can do themselves—from home funerals and taxidermy to representing yourself in court. Moreover, the show maintains an artful balance of general interest content and local events."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/pump-up-the-volume/Content?oid=6511757|title=Pump Up the Volume|work=Portland Mercury}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2011, ''[[Sunset (magazine)|Sunset]]'' named Sabatier "Portland's DIY Queen" and wrote that the show "taps into the zeitgeist that is red hot in the West."&lt;ref name="oregonlive.com"/&gt; [[Radio Survivor]] reported on Destination DIY's crowd-funding strategy in 2013 and described the show as a "polished production on par with a national public radio program."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosurvivor.com/2013/11/20/podcast-survivor-crowdfunding-destination-diy/|title=Podcast Survivor: Crowdfunding Destination DIY|work=Radio Survivor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portland television station [[KGW]] has reported on two ''Rendered'' "Makin' It" parties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kgw.com/thesquare/PDX-Tonight-Makin-It-with-Destination-DIY-148988305.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sustainable Business Oregon'' also reported on the "Makin' It" parties and featured an interview with Sabatier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainablebusinessoregon.com/articles/2013/09/scrap-py-and-sustainable-makin-it.html?page=all|title=Behind the scenes at Destination DIY's Makin' It event - Portland Business Journal|date=24 September 2013|work=Portland Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
''Rendered'' is primarily listener-funded.

The '''''Saint Vincent Panels''''', or the ''Adoration of Saint Vincent'' panels, are a [[polyptych]] consisting of six panels that were perhaps painted in the 1450s. They are attributed to the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Nuno Gonçalves]], who was active from 1450 to 1471. Traditionally, the polyptych is dated to the 1450s due to the putative prominence of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] among the persons represented in the panels (Henry died in 1460). Controversy concerning the true nature of Henry's presence in the panels - if any - along with the inclusion of figures that can be identified as his brothers, all of whom died before 1450, renders it difficult to assign any secure date for the creation of the panels other than sometime during the ''[[floruit]]'' of the painter Gonçalves.

The original retable, during its stay in the Cathedral of Lisbon, contained "over twelve" panels, as a source from 1767 states.&lt;ref&gt;Adriano de Gusmão, Nuno Gonçalves; The Burlington Magazine Vol. 98, No. 638 (May, 1956), pp. 166+169&lt;/ref&gt; They were displayed in the cathedral at least until 1690 and were set aside in the cathedral until 1742. They were then transferred to the palace of Mitra, where they escaped the devastating [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|earthquake of Lisbon in 1755]].

The panels are now housed in the [[Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga]] (National Museum of Antique Art), in [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]].

== Discovery ==

Found during the late 1880s in the [[monastery]] of [[Monastery of São Vicente de Fora|Saint Vicente de Fora]] in Lisbon, the panels depict scenes associated with the veneration of [[Vincent of Saragossa|Saint Vincent of Saragossa]]. This polyptych consists of six separate panels of [[oak]] painted with oil or [[tempera]].

The only reference that art historians can use to support the attribution of the creation of the panels to the painter Gonçalves was written in the 16th century by [[Francisco de Holanda]].&lt;ref&gt;Francisco de Holanda, Da pintura antiga (Lisbon, 1548)&lt;/ref&gt; The reference mentions a great work of art made by him that is inferred to be these panels. There has also been speculation that the father of [[Hugo van der Goes]] collaborated in the painting of the panels, but no firm evidence to support this hypothesis exists.  In any case, the ''Saint Vincent Panels'' are regarded as the greatest achievement of pre-modern Portuguese art.

[[File:Nuno Gonçalves. Paineis de São Vicente de Fora.jpg|thumb|center|750px|''Saint Vincent Panels''. From left to right: Panel of the Friars, Panel of the Fishermen, Panel of the Prince, Panel of the Archbishop, Panel of the Knights, and Panel of the Relic]]

==Interpretations ==

Since their discovery in the late 19th century, there has been a continuing dispute over the identity of the painter and the subjects portrayed on the panels. Some basic questions, still unanswered, are these:

* What scene, or scenes, are depicted in the panels?
* Who are the sixty persons portrayed?
* What symbolism is expressed in the panels?
* Who commissioned these panels to be painted?

The majority of experts who have studied this polyptych agree that the panels display several social groups of 15th-century Portugal. They also agree that the children of King [[John I of Portugal|John I]] are represented on these panels, but there is disagreement about their placement and identity.

=== Panel of the Prince: alternative hypothesis ===

[[Image:Painéis de São Vicente3.jpg|thumb|right|220px|The third panel - Panel of the Prince]]

One of the more controversial issues concerning the panels is the depiction of Prince [[Henry the Navigator]]. At first glance, the appearance of the man in black in the third panel is quite compatible with traditional conceptions of Prince Henry's likeness: a man with a light moustache and distinctive black [[Chaperon (headgear)|round chaperon]] such as can be found in numerous representations today. However, there are strong reasons to doubt that this is him.&lt;ref name="Marques"&gt;António Salvador Marques, 1998, [http://paineis.org/INDICE.htm Painéis de S. Vicente de Fora] (accessed 15-8-2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Henry the Navigator (Cronicas).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Frontispiece in Zurara's ''Crónicas dos Feitos de Guiné'' (Paris codex)]]
The most basic problem in identifying the man-in-the-chaperon in the Saint Vincent Panels derives from the lack of confirmed portraits of Prince Henry that date from his lifetime. The only other 15th-century image of the man-in-the-chaperon is found in the frontispiece of a copy (currently held by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]) of [[Gomes Eanes de Zurara]]'s ''Crónicas dos Feitos de Guiné'', written in 1453.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; Zurara's book is an account of the early [[Portuguese discoveries]] in Africa along with a [[hagiography]] of Prince Henry, to whom the author assigned singular credit for the discoveries. As a result, it has been assumed that the frontispiece depicts Henry, especially since the motto underneath it seems to have been Henry's own.
 
One alternative hypothesis postulates that the man-in-the-chaperon in Zurara's book might actually be King [[Edward of Portugal]] (r. 1431-38), Prince Henry's brother.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; It has been pointed out that critical phases of the discoveries were launched during his reign, and it would not be unusual for a portrait of a king to adorn a chronicle of events that occurred during his reign.

This alternative hypothesis can be used to help clarify the identity of the figures  surrounding St. Vincent in the Panel of the Prince. Specifically, it offers an explanation for the symmetrical arrangement of men and women as pairings of kings and queens. In this interpretation, the standing pair would be King Edward (in a black chaperon), standing at the right and balanced on the left by his wife, Queen [[Eleanor of Aragon, Queen of Portugal|Eleanor of Aragon]]. Below them would be their son, King [[Afonso V of Portugal]], kneeling on the right and facing his consort, Queen [[Isabella of Coimbra]], who is kneeling on the left. The boy in the panel would then be Edward's heir, the future King [[John II of Portugal]].&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt;

This alternative hypothesis seems more logical than the original hypothesis that insists on identifying the man-in-the-chaperon as Prince Henry. Since Henry was a bachelor, it is not obvious what woman would be suitable to pair with him as the standing figure on the left. His closest female relatives were his mother [[Philippa of Lancaster|Philippa]] and sister, [[Isabella of Portugal (1397–1471)|Isabella]], Duchess of Burgundy, both of whom would be more properly paired with their husbands. Moreover, Isabella did not live in Portugal after 1430, thus her lack of involvement with Portuguese society at the time the panel was painted would probably disqualify her from inclusion. If the uncle of a king were to be incorporated in the panel, it would more properly be [[Peter, Duke of Coimbra]], who was once the regent of Afonso V and the father of his bride.

Another interpretation of the figures includes Henry in the panel, but proposes Edward as the kneeling king and Afonso V as the boy. Regardless, all traditional means of explaining Henry's presence in the panel strike one as forced, formulated simply to accommodate a preconceived notion that Henry must be the man-in-the-chaperon. Since Edward was the brother of Henry, it is perfectly possible that he bore a close enough resemblance to Henry that the traditional identification in the Zurara book is perfectly correct, and that Edward's appearance in the panel is only coincidentally similar to what is depicted for Henry in the Zurara book.

The alternative hypothesis with King Edward as the man-in-the-chaperon is more logical; pairs of kings and queens are all that are featured in the panel, with no intrusion from other family members, except for the minor son of one of the royal pairs.  Other relatives are featured in a panel of their own (see below). In consideration of this, the Panel of the Prince perhaps ought to be called the Panel of Kings instead, with the king intended to be featured most prominently apparently Afonso V, who was the reigning king of Portugal throughout the ''floruit'' of Nuno Gonçalves, thus the most likely candidate as patron for the preparation of the panels.

=== Panel of the Knights: alternative hypothesis ===

[[Image:Nuño Gonçalves 001.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The fifth panel - Panel of the Knights]]

Hypotheses that assert Henry the Navigator is not the man-in-the-chaperon identify him in another panel: the fifth panel known as the "Panel of the Knights". This alternative interpretation posits that the four knights featured in the panel are the four younger brothers of King [[Edward of Portugal]],&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; as follows:
* On the right is [[Infante Peter, Duke of Coimbra|Peter, Duke of Coimbra]], who was prince regent during the minority of Afonso V; he is wearing a belt of the [[Order of the Garter]]. 
* On the left is [[John, Constable of Portugal|John of Reguengos]], Constable of Portugal, in the red color and blade-holding pose typical of the [[Order of Saint James of the Sword]], of which he was the master.
* On top, helmeted and bearded in black, is [[Ferdinand the Holy Prince]], who died after spending many years as a hostage in a Moroccan prison.  His beard, long hair and emaciated face may reflect his long captivity.  It is possible that the reflection on his helmet is intended to represent the end of a Moorish prison window or (in conjunction with his beard), a [[Cross fleury]], the badge of the [[Order of Aviz]], of which he was the master.
* Below, kneeling in purple, is Prince [[Henry the Navigator]], master of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]], with what seems like that order's cross pendant on his neck and a loose belt of the Order of the Garter.  The face of this grey-haired Henry is very different from traditional portrayals.

There has also been much discussion around the possible political significances of this panel.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; It seems, in particular, that by the poses, this panel aims to humiliate Henry the Navigator, possibly for allying himself with [[Afonso, 1st Duke of Braganza|Afonso of Braganza]] against his full brother Peter, Duke of Coimbra, in the [[Battle of Alfarrobeira]] in 1449.  These features of the portrait have been noted: 
* Henry is on his knees, seemingly begging for forgiveness, while Peter and John seem to "stand guard" over him.  
* The pendant Order of Christ cross around Henry's neck is broken.
* Henry's garter belt is untied and disheveled, whereas Peter's is worn properly. 
* The pommel of Henry's sword is twisted, dull and draped in black thread, whereas Peter and John's swords are shiny, laced with gold and silver threads.
* Henry's head is penitently uncovered, whereas Peter and John wear the caps of nobles.
* Peter and John are wearing white gloves, perhaps to denote guilt-free "clean hands", whereas Henry is ungloved.
* Henry seems to gaze straight across to another panel, as if her were asking forgiveness from the royal dynasty he had "wronged", whereas Peter and John look at the spectators.

It is worth remarking that the colors chosen for the princes seem to match the [[liturgical colors]] of the [[Roman rite]]—black (Ferdinand) for mourning of the dead, green (Peter) for ordinary, red (John) for passion and sacrifice and purple (Henry) for penance and mortification.&lt;ref&gt;"Liturgical Colors" at Catholic Encyclopedia [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04134a.htm online]&lt;/ref&gt;

If this interpretation is valid, then the polyptych of St. Vincent may very well have been conceived by Nuno Gonçalves as a piece of anti-Braganza political propaganda, one possible reason it might have remained hidden for years.&lt;ref name="Marques"/&gt; It would also set up a ''[[terminus post quem]]'' for the creation of the panels; they would have to have been painted after 1449 (the date of the Battle of Alfarrobeira). That would tend to support the traditional belief that they date from the 1450s (when passions left over from that conflict would still have been fresh), however if the boy depicted in the Panel of the Prince can be identified as the future King John II (b. 1455), his height and appearance would certainly indicate a child older than five years' old, thus a date in the 1460s would be more likely.

The '''Shiv leni Caves''' (Shiva leni; Jogai Mandap; Hattikhana) in [[Ambajogai]], [[Maharashtra]] of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]] are  [[rock cut architecture|rock-cut]] cave monuments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/92037/_http___www_bl_uk_onlinegallery_onlineex_apac_photocoll_g_zoomify62930_html.html|title= Shivleni - Jogai Mandir Cave Temple, Ambajogi|accessdate=23 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which date in King [[Udayaditya]] (reigned c. 1060–1087) to about  "In all, total excavations were hewn out of rock cut and carved deep inside the hill",  The caves include sculptures described by the government [[Archaeological Survey of India]] as "the finest surviving examples of Indian art", which are masterpieces with figures of the Hindu and depictions of the 'Hindu Puraan' tales.
[[File:Frontside of Shivleni.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.10 |Frontside view of Shivleni]]

The site is a listed in "[[List of State Protected Monuments in Maharashtra]]" - protected monument in the care of the Department of Archaeology of Maharashtra, India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho0001000s4u00450000.html|title= General view of the Jogai Mandir Cave Temple, Ambajogi|accessdate=23 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the Maharashtra Ancient Monumnets and Archeological Sites &amp; Remains Act, 1960, the Shivleni Caves (Jogai Mandap) have been a [[Archaeological Survey of India]] Heritage Site.

==About==

Shivleni (Jogai Sabhamandap) Cave are situated hardly half a kilometer to the north-west of Yogeshvari Temple, along the banks of the river Jayvanti.  The caves are squares in shape and are carved deep inside the hill.  On the southern side of the hill is the entrance.  Inside mandap(pavilion) has an 8.36 sq m. court-yard in front and inside the roof is supported by four pillars.

==Inside Caves==
In the centre of the court-yard there is an elegantly carved nandimandap measuring 9.14x9.14 meters.  In the center of this mandap there is an image of nandi. The inside of the cave is impressive; one hall is supported by thirty two pillars and adorned with sculptures of Shiva and Ganesha.

==History and Inscription==
A inscription found here dated Saka 1066 records the grant as inams for the maintenance of these caves by the Rastrakuta king Udayaditya who was Mahamandalesvar.  This inscription has been removed to the Tahsildar's office at Ambajogai for safe custody and preservation.

There is a local story related to the monument. Which says that the monument is the wedding court of the ''jogaidevi,'' whose temple is situated nearby. It is said that the wedding was planned to take place in this ''mandap'' but couldn't take place due to some super natural reasons and the elephants and everything inside it turned to stone. That is why the name 'Jogai Mandap' is given to it. 

There is also a local belief that there is an underground tunnel in this ''Hattikhana'' which leads to Parli Vaijanath, which is around 25&amp;nbsp;km from there. But it was believed to have been shut down by the authorities.

==Protection==
The monument is now a state protected monument under the Maharashtra Ancient Monuments and archaeological sites &amp; Remains Act, 1960.

'''''Still Life with a Turkey Pie''''' is a 1627 [[still life]] painting by the Dutch painter [[Pieter Claesz]], now in the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam. It was in the collection of Baroness Cecilia-Maria van Pallandt at [[Keukenhof]] Castle from 1881. Her descendants sold it to the Hague-based art dealer S.Neistad in 1974 for 300,000 guilders. He sold it onto its present owners later the same year for 832,000 guilders.

The '''4th Symphony "Martín y Soler"''' of [[Claudio Prieto]] was composed in 2006 as a commission from the [[Orquesta de Valencia]], which premiered it on February 23, 2007 with [[Antoni Ros-Marbà]] conducting the ensemble. 

The Symphony is made up of a single 50' long movement and was composed as a tribute to Valencian composer [[Vicente Martín y Soler]], evoking his time's aesthetic while raising Prieto's personal view of the projection of his figure, both in artistic and biographic terms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2594">The '''Symphony No. 5''' is the fifth symphony by the American composer [[George Rochberg]].  It was commissioned by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], which first performed the piece under the direction of [[Georg Solti]] on March 13, 1986.  The symphony has a duration of approximately 28 minutes and is cast a single continuous [[Movement (music)|movement]].  It was a finalist for the 1986 [[Pulitzer Prize for Music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Bret |title=Obituary: George Rochberg |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 June 2005 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/02/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The symphony has been largely praised by music critics.  Reviewing a recording of the piece, Andrew Farach-Colton of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' called it "a gripping, emotionally expansive work – cast in a single movement of almost half an hour's duration – whose gestures are defiantly traditional."  He added, "Rochberg alludes here to [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] and [[Dmitri Shostakovich|Shostakovich]], among others, though he somehow manages to create a unified, utterly individual style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Farach-Colton |first=Andrew |title=Rochberg Symphony No 5: Intensely wrought music with its roots in Mahler and Varèse, played with dedication |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=October 2003 |url=https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/rochberg-symphony-no-5 |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anthony Burton of ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'' was slightly more critical, however, remarking, "The Fifth Symphony, unheard since its premiere by the Chicago Symphony and Solti in 1986, is in a single large movement, alternating between anguished near-atonality and much more consonant slow episodes, largely in the accents of Mahler; as it progresses it settles increasingly into the slower music, a shift which feels suspiciously like a capitulation to easy listening rather than a genuine resolution of conflict."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Burton |first=Anthony |title=Rochberg: Symphony No. 5; Black Sounds; Transcendental Variations |work=[[BBC Music Magazine]] |date=2003 |url=http://www.classical-music.com/review/rochberg-0 |accessdate=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''''The Baptism of Christ''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Piero della Francesca]], finished around 1448–50. It is housed in the [[National Gallery]], London.

The panel was commissioned presumably some time about 1440 by the [[Camaldolese]] [[Monastery]] of [[Sansepolcro]] in [[Tuscany]], originally part of a [[triptych]]. Its dating to Piero della Francesca's early career is evidenced by the strong relationship with the "light painting" of his master, [[Domenico Veneziano]].

It portrays [[Baptism of Christ|Christ being baptised]] by [[St. John the Baptist|John]], his head surmounted by a [[dove]] representing the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]]. Christ, John's hand, the bird and the bowl form an axis which divides the painting in two symmetrical parts.  A second division is created by the tree on the left, which instead divides it according to the [[golden ratio]].

Behind John, a man in white briefs, his feet already in the water, is struggling to get out of his undershirt. The three angels on the left wear different clothes and, in a break from traditional iconography, are not supporting Christ's garments, but are holding each other's hands, in a sort of way. This could be an allusion to the contemporary [[Council of Florence]] (1431–45), whose goal was the unification of the Western and Eastern Churches. The Camaldolese [[monk]] and [[theology|theologian]], [[Saint Ambrose Traversari]] (+1439), who had been [[Prior|Prior General]] of the [[congregation (Catholic)|Camaladolese congregation]], had been a strong supporter of the union. Such symbolism is also suggested by the presence, behind the [[wikt:neophyte|neophyte]] on the right, of figures dressed in an oriental fashion.

Piero della Francesca was renowned in his times as an authority on perspective and geometry: his attention to the theme is shown by John's arm and leg, which form two angles of the same size.

'''''The Death of Young Bara''''', '''''Joseph Bara''''' or '''''The Death of Bara''''' is an incomplete 1794 painting by the French artist [[Jacques-Louis David]], now in the [[musée Calvet]]. [[Joseph Bara]], a young drummer in the army of the [[French First Republic]], killed by the [[Vendean Revolt|Vendéens]]. He became a hero and martyr of the [[French Revolution]] and – with ''[[The Death of Marat]]'' and ''[[The Last Moments of Michel Lepeletier]]'' – the painting formed part of a series by David showing such martyrs. There is also an anonymous contemporary copy dating to 1794, now in the [[musée des beaux-arts de Lille]] and exhibited at the [[Musée de la Révolution française]].

'''The Lord is My Shepherd''' is an 1863 oil on wood painting by American artist [[Eastman Johnson]]. The painting measures 16 5/8 x 13 1/8 in. (42.3 x 33.2&amp;nbsp;cm.) and is on display at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref name=Smithson&gt;{{cite web|title=The Lord Is My Shepherd|url=http://www.americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=11494|publisher=[[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The title of the painting comes from [[Psalms#psalm_23|Psalm 23]], which begins with the line: "The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want." Johnson painted it just after the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] was announced in 1863. Its imagery includes an African-American man reading the first part of a Bible, possibly the [[Book of Exodus]]. He is sitting against a blue jacket, which may indicate service in the Union army. President Abraham Lincoln had recently authorized organization of the [[United States Colored Troops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Harvey |first=Eleanor Jones |author-link=Eleanor Jones Harvey |title=Painting Freedom |publisher=''New York Times'' |date=2013-10-30 |url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/painting-freedom/?_r=1&amp; |accessdate =2013-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of several works by Eastman Johnson with African-American subjects.

== Critical response ==
Owen Gleiberman writing for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "The great strength of ''The New Radical'' is that it's not on its subjects' side (or totally against them either).

'''''The Patriot''''' is a 1998 American [[action film|action]] [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] loosely based on the novel ''[[The Last Canadian]]'' by [[William C. Heine]]. The film stars [[Steven Seagal]] and is directed by [[Dean Semler]]. The plot involves an American patriot who has to foil the plot of a [[militia]] to release a deadly [[virus]]. It is Seagal's first [[direct-to-video]] film.

==Plot==
Near the town of [[Ennis, Montana|Ennis]], [[Montana]], local doctor and former government research immunologist Wesley McClaren ([[Steven Seagal]]) who has an interest in [[Herbalism|herbal medicine]] and is also a weapons and self-defense expert, is called to a hospital when people start dying from an unknown but very deadly disease. He determines that the cause is a highly dangerous airborne [[virus]] and calls in a Biological Response team, who seal off the town while doctors start treating sufferers with a vaccine. Unfortunately for them, several have already died.

The source of the virus is traced to a local self-styled [[Rebellion|rebel]] [[Militia organizations in the United States|militia]] leader, Floyd Chisholm ([[Gailard Sartain]]), who has given himself up after a long siege and has been arrested on weapons charges. In court, having ingested the virus himself (believing that he also possesses the vaccine) he spits at the judge, and starts the rapid spread of the disease.

Floyd's [[militia]] followers, who have been allowed to go free, attack the prison and rescue Floyd. They then proceed to invade and besiege the hospital, with much loss of life, and take medical personnel hostage including Wesley and his daughter Holly ([[Camilla Belle]]). But too late, they realize that the vaccine they were seeking at the hospital is the same as the one they possess which only delays the effect of the deadly virus.
Working at gunpoint, Wesley takes a sample of Holly's blood; it shows that Holly has been infected, but somehow her body is fighting it off. Wesley and Holly contrive to escape and travel to a farm where Holly's grandfather lives. Wesley takes a blood sample from his friend Dr. Ann White Cloud (Whitney Yellow Robe), and realizes that her body is also fighting off the infection.

Wesley and Ann gain access to a secret underground laboratory where Wesley used to work, where they hope to come up with a cure. Wesley finds out why Ann and Holly are not being affected by the virus: they have been drinking tea made with a specific wild herb that is known to Native American healers.

Back at the hospital, Wesley and Holly are captured by the militia, but he manages to kill Floyd and disable the other soldiers. As soon as the biological protection team learn of the cure, they go out and pick all the flowers they can find and drop them by helicopter over the town, telling the people to boil them and drink the liquid.

==Production==
The film, directed by [[63rd Academy Awards|academy-award-winning]] [[cinematographer]] [[Dean Semler]], was reportedly originally intended as a theatrical release, but was ultimately released [[direct-to-video]], the first Seagal film to skip theaters entirely.&lt;ref name="Vern"&gt;{{cite book |last=Vern |date= March 2012 |title= Seagalogy: A Study of the Ass-Kicking Films of Steven Seagal |location=London |publisher=[[Titan Books]] |isbn=978-0857687227 |page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shot over eight weeks in [[Ennis, Montana|Ennis]] and [[Virginia City, Montana|Virginia City]], [[Montana]], and for three days on the campus of [[Montana State University]]. Filming was briefly halted to remove snow from the ground during shooting in Virginia City, to maintain continuity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haines |first= Joan |date= November 11, 1997 |title= Seagal wraps up filming of 'The Patriot' |url=http://www.bozemandailychronicle.com/article_316f073d-6fe2-5f97-9264-3920412e23f5.html |newspaper=Bozeman Daily Chronicle |location=Bozeman, MT |accessdate= October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[screenplay]] is credited to M. Sussman and John Kingswell, assumed to be [[pseudonyms]] due to the complete lack of information on either writer (neither has any other film credit of any kind). Several writers, including [[David Ayer]] and Paul Mones&lt;ref name="Vern"/&gt; were rumored to be working on the script prior to its release; Mones was ultimately credited as a producer. Though the movie is credited as an adaptation of [[William C. Heine|William C. Heine's]] novel ''[[The Last Canadian]]'', it shares virtually no similarities with the novel except the idea of a deadly virus. No character names, events, or even locations appear in both the book and the film.&lt;ref name="Vern"/&gt;

The film is Seagal's only effort to date in which he co-stars with his daughter, actress [[Ayako Fujitani]], and is notable for an extremely low amount of action scenes compared to Seagal's other work.

==Reception==

The film has received generally negative reviews, with critics frequently singling out the extremely low number of action sequences. David Nusair of Reel Film Reviews called it "dull" and criticized its lack of action (he claims, "Out of a 90 minute movie, there's maybe 10 minutes of actual Seagal hand-to-hand combat") and unwelcome political messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mini Reviews (January 2001)|url=http://www.reelfilm.com/mini2.htm#patriot|author=David Nusair|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Seagalogy]]'' author Vern argues that "in many ways ''The Patriot'' is an admirable effort," noting "The production values and acting are better than some of Seagal's subsequent movies," but going on to point out that due to its "ridiculously low action quotient it is a least-favorite of many Seagal fans."&lt;ref name=Vern/&gt; As of 2 October 2014, the film has a 22% "rotten" critics rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] (based on 9 reviews).&lt;ref name="Rotten Tomatoes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1085744-patriot/|title=The Patriot - Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Social Significance of the Modern Drama''''' is a 1914 treatise by [[Emma Goldman]] on political implications of significant playwrights in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

Goldman, who had done significant work with [[Modernist drama, theatre and performance|Modernist dramatists]] (managing tours, hosting, publicizing, and lecturing), here published her analyses of the political implications of modern drama. The book featured analyses of the political—even radical—implications of the work of playwrights including [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[August Strindberg]], [[Hermann Sudermann]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Edmond Rostand]], [[Brieux]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[John Galsworthy]], [[Stanley Houghton]], [[Githa Sowerby]],&lt;ref&gt;For more information on this little-known playwright, see Mark Brown, [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/aug/14/githa-sowerby-playwright-rutherford-son "Githa Sowerby, the Forgotten Playwright, Returns to Stage"], ''Guardian'', 2009/08/14.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Butler Yeats]], [[Lennox Robinson]], [[T. G. Murray]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Anton Tchekhof]] (more familiar in English as "Anton Chekhov"), [[Maxim Gorki]], and [[Leonid Andreyev]]. Goldman published the book as she set out on a tour, hoping to acquaint radicals and ordinary citizens alike to the radical potential of modern drama.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Waterman, [http://ahistoryofnewyork.com/2008/10/goldman-and-middleton-feminism-and-modern-drama/ "Goldman and Middleton: Feminism and Modern Drama"], ''Patell and Waterman's History of New York'', Oct. 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was first published in 1914, Richard G. Badger, The Gorham Press, in Boston, and in Toronto, the Copp Clark Co., Ltd. The book was not a commercial success, and was quickly out of print.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Carlson &amp; Erika Munk, Foreword to the 2000 edition, Hal Leonard Corp., {{ISBN|0-936839-62-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11286">[[File:Aristotle and Phyllis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Woodcut of Aristotle ridden by Phyllis by [[Hans Baldung]], 1515]]
The '''tale of Phyllis and Aristotle''' is a [[Cautionary tale|cautionary medieval tale]] about the triumph of a seductive woman, Phyllis, over the greatest male intellect, the ancient Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]]. It is one of several [[Power of Women]] stories from that time. Among early versions is the French '''''Lai d'Aristote''''' from 1220.

The story of the [[dominatrix]] and the famous intellectual was taken up by artists from the 12th century onwards, in media from stone sculpture in churches to panels of wood or ivory, textiles such as carpets and tapestries, engravings, oil paintings, brass jugs ([[aquamanile]]), and stained glass. Artists attracted to the theme include [[Hans Baldung]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], and [[Alessandro Turchi]].

==Story==
The tale varies in the telling, but the core of it is as follows: [[Aristotle]] advised his pupil [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] to avoid the [[Philip of Macedon|king]]'s seductive mistress, Phyllis, but was himself captivated by her. She agreed to ride him, on condition that she could play the role of [[dominatrix]]. Phyllis had secretly told Alexander what to expect, and he witnessed Phyllis proving that a woman's charms could overcome even the greatest philosopher's male intellect. Phyllis is also described as Alexander's mistress, or possibly wife, rather than his father's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/20121 |publisher=[[Art Institute Chicago]] |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith2013"&gt;{{cite web |author=Smith, Justin E.

The story is said by the [[Louvre]] to derive from the German work &lt;!--''{{Aristoteles und Phyllis|de}}'' --&gt;by [[Jacques de Vitry]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=Louvre/&gt; The French work ''Le {{ill|Lai d'Aristote|fr}}'' (The Lay of Aristotle) is known from manuscripts dating from as early as 1220, attributed by scholars to either [[Henri d'Andeli]] or {{ill|Henri de Valenciennes|fr}}.&lt;ref&gt;Wathelet-Willem, Jeanne.

II. Arguments linguistiques", ''Revue de linguistique romane'', n° 68, 2004, pp. 57–78, and "Henri de Valenciennes, auteur du Lai d'Aristote et de la Vie de saint Jean l'Évangéliste", in ''Revue de linguistique romane'', n° 69, 2004, pp. 335–358.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The source of the work was still contested in 2007 - see Mihai Cristian Bratu, ''L'Émergence de l'auteur dans l'historiographie médiévale en prose en langue française'', Ph.D., New York University, 2007, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1386, the English poet [[John Gower]] included a summary of the tale in his ''[[Confessio Amantis]]'' (in English, unlike his other major works), a collection of stories of immoral love told in verse. It appears in the poem on [[Apollonius of Tyre]] (Book 8, 271–2018), where Gower quips that the philosopher's logic and syllogisms do not save him:&lt;ref name=DNBG&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Gower, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''I syh there Aristotle also'',&lt;br&gt;
:''Whom that the queene of Grece so''&lt;br&gt;
:''Hath [[bridle]]d, that in thilke time''&lt;br&gt;

:''Thurgh which it mihte ben excluded''&lt;br&gt;
:''That he ne was fully concluded''&lt;br&gt;
:''To love, and dede his obeissance''

Also in the 14th century, the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] John Herold wrote a Latin version of the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sarton |first1=George |authorlink=George Sarton |title=Aristotle and Phyllis |journal=Isis |date=1930 |volume=14 |pages=8–19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Latin and English"&gt;{{cite web|title=Phyllis and Aristotle|url=http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/phyllis/phyllis_w_img.htm|accessdate=1 April 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122070456/http://www2.latech.edu/~bmagee/201/phyllis/phyllis_w_img.htm|archivedate=22 November 2012|language=Latin|quote=ARISTOTLES, cum doceret Alexandrum ut se contineret ab accessu frequenti uxoris suae, quae erat pulcra valde, ne animum suum a communi providentia impediret, et Alexander ei acquiesceret, hoc advertens regina et dolens, coepit Aristotelem trahere ad amorem suum, quia multociens sola transibat cum pedibus nudis et dissoluto crine, ut eum alliceret.|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===

The [[cautionary tale]] of the dominatrix who made a fool of the famous philosopher became popular across medieval Europe.&lt;ref name="Smith2013"/&gt; Medieval sculptors in Maasland created [[aquamanile]], jugs in the forms of scenes with human or other figures, depicting Phyllis and Aristotle. The story was depicted in a variety of media including stone, ivory, brass, carpet, [[tapestry]], and engravings.

===Early Modern to Enlightenment===
Artists such as [[Hans Baldung]], [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], [[Bartholomeus Spranger]] and [[Jan Sadeler]] continued to exploit the theme, eventually with Phyllis entirely naked.&lt;ref name=Louvre&gt;{{cite web |title=Phyllis and Aristotle {{!}} The Triumph of Seduction over Intellect |url=https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/phyllis-and-aristotle |publisher=[[Louvre]] |accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alessandro Turchi]] called the woman [[Campaspe]], the mistress of Alexander. The works used media including engraving, stained glass, wood, and oil painting.

'''Tournai fonts''' are a type of [[baptismal font]] made from blue black [[limestone]] during the 12th and early 13th centuries in and around the Belgian town of [[Tournai]] by local masons.{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}} There are seven complete examples in England{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}} and a disputed number in Europe: eighty according to one source,{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}} or fifty in Northern France and Belgium and two in Germany according to another.{{sfn|Wadsworth}}

A sculptural tradition, centred around Tournai, arose in the [[Scheldt]] valley from the 11th century onwards.{{sfn|Hourihane, p. 287}} This was characterised by its use of low [[relief]] (which was a useful feature when a sculpture was transported),{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 90}} hard lines and the depiction of minute detail, these features arising from the hardness of the material used from the 12th century; Tournai marble.{{sfn|Hourihane, p. 287}} As a sculptural style it is distinguished from the contemporary style of [[Mosan art]], and it was used in sculpture in both [[Ghent]] and [[Bruges]].{{sfn|Hourihane, p. 287}} The designation "Tournai font" is employed to identify fonts made by local masons who worked the stone, as opposed to at least two other schools of masons who also sculpted the stone.{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}}

==Construction==
The fonts are all sculpted from a single massive block{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}} of blue black [[Carboniferous Period|carboniferous]] limestone, known as "Tournai marble" (while not a true [[marble]], it was so called  as it is capable of taking a polish{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}}), quarried from the banks of the River Scheldt. This seam of limestone runs from around [[Boulogne]] through the Scheldt and [[Meuse]] regions at [[Tournai]] and [[Namur]] to Aachen, and has been quarried and sculpted since [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.  One of these quarries, at [[Veldt-lès-Tournai]], is still in operation.{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}} As a stone, Tournai marble was prized for its high polish, which made it appear black, and it was popular not only for fonts but also for elements of ecclesiastical architecture (capitals, bases and colonnettes), as well as for tombslabs.{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 89}} 

Each font weighs approximately {{conv|2|tonne|ST kg lb}}{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}} and was probably carved before transport;{{sfn|Tudor-Craig, p. 152}} this can be inferred not only from the fact that the stylistic elements (of people, flora and fauna) on all the fonts in England and the continent show a resemblance, and because the fonts themselves are all of the same shape,{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 90}} but also because transport was difficult and expensive, and there would have been little point expending money and effort taking such heavy blocks to a distant site and then discarding up to half the block as waste material.{{sfn|Drake (1999), p. 11}}

[[File:Montdidier église St-Pierre (fonts baptismaux) 1.jpg|thumb|220px|right|St-Pierre de Montdidier, France.]]

===Complete fonts in churches===
The font at Onze Lieve Vrouwekerk, [[Dendermonde]] (Belgium) illustrates the story of [[Saint Peter]]'s denial of [[Jesus]].{{sfn|Wadsworth}} The font at [[Meise|Wolvertem]] (Belgium) is unusual in being round, square being the usual shape.{{sfn|Wadsworth}} There are also complete Tournai fonts in Blessy (France), [[Deftinge]] (Belgium), [[:fr:Deux-Acren|Deux-Acren]] (Belgium), [[Guarbecque]] (France), [[Hove, Belgium|Hove]] (Belgium), [[Lichtervelde]] (Belgium), [[:fr:Église Saint-Pierre de Montdidier|Montdidier]] (St Pierre) (France), [[:fr:Église Notre-Dame de La Neuville de Corbie|La Neuville-lès-Corbie]] (France), [[Noordpeene]] (France), [[Saint-Just-en-Chaussée]] (France), [[Vermand]] (France), [[Zedelgem]] (Belgium) and [[Zillebeke]] (Belgium).{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

====Bases and fragments====
Bases of Tournai fonts are in churches in [[Bourghelles]] (France), [[Évin-Malmaison]] (France), [[:fr:Froyennes|Froyennes]] (Belgium), [[Herentals]] (Belgium), [[Ichtegem]] (Belgium), [[Meilegem]] (Belgium), [[Ribemont]] (France), [[Roubaix]] (France) and [[St Sauveur]]{{dn|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--[[:fr:Saint-Sauveur (Belgique)]]?--&gt;.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}  There are fragments of Tournai fonts in churches in Baardegem, Comines, Ere, Escanaffles (building material), Lampernisse, Lessines (St Pierre) (building material), Nivelles and Soignies.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

===In museums===
Complete fonts are at [[Châlons-sur-Marne]] (cathedral) and Gondecourt, a base at Pervijse, and fragments at Ghent (St Bavon), Kontich, and Rotselaer.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

===Disputed examples===
Disputed examples of Tournai fonts are at Chéreng, [[Compiègne]] (St Antoine), Hautmont, and Laon (cathedral). The fragment at Le Tréport is also disputed.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

===Lost===
Formerly complete Tournai fonts, now lost, were at the following locations: Gallaix; Neuf-Berquin; St Venant; and Vimy.  At Stalhille, a recorded base is lost, as are fragments at Binche, Spiennes, and Spiere.{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}  St Venant, destroyed in World War I, had the most complete cycle of the [[Passion of Christ]] known on any Romanesque font.{{sfn|Drake (2010), p. 9, note 20}}

===Hampshire===
For their transport to England they were exported under the protection of a caravan organised by the Tournai guild known as the Charité-St-Christophe.{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 89}} and taken either over land to Boulogne and across the Channel, or down the Scheldt.{{sfn|Schwartzbaum, p. 90}} On account of their weight and the difficulty of land transport, their ultimate destinations were locations on the south or east coast, or places accessible by river.{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}}
The Charité-St-Christophe had commercial links with Winchester, and probably brought the four Hampshire fonts to the county,{{sfn|Wadsworth}} most likely under the patronage of [[Henry of Blois]].{{sfn|Tudor-Craig, p. 152}}&lt;!-- not all singing from the same hymnbook here --&gt;

====All Saints, East Meon====
The font of c. 1130–40{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 200}} was probably a gift to the church from [[Henry of Blois]], Bishop of Winchester.{{sfn|Wadsworth}} The friezes on its sides depict the creation of [[Adam and Eve]] and the Temptation (north face); the [[Expulsion from the Garden of Eden]] and Adam being shown how to dig (east face); and various animals, birds and dragons on the south and west faces.{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 200}} 

====St Peter's, St Mary Bourne====
This is the largest of the English fonts{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}} and, according to Pevsner, "one of the most splendid".{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 494}} There are arches on coupled colonnettes on the north and west faces; on the east and south faces are trees of life with grapes. The top of the font is circled with reeds; the corners display two birds drinking and leaves, forming an "oriental motif".{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 494}} A new base for the font was made in 1927 in Tournai.{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}}

====St Michael's, Southampton====
Located in the south-west corner of the church, the font's decoration is to Pevsner "far more elementary than that on the font at Winchester".{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 523}} Each face has three medallions, on eleven of which "grotesque figures"{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 523}} are carved, mostly with wings, with a single man carved on the twelfth. The pillars that support the font are not made of Tournai marble but of Purbeck marble, and are renewed.{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 523}} 

====Winchester Cathedral====
The font – the "most famous" of the Tournai fonts in England{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 683}} – illustrates scenes from the life of [[Saint Nicholas|St Nicholas of Myra]] on two faces, with three roundels of birds on the third and a roundel of a quadruped with birds on either side on the fourth.{{sfn|Pevsner and Lloyd, p. 683}} It is the only font in the cathedral, and is located in the nave,

===Lincolnshire===
St Lawrence's, [[Thornton Curtis]], and [[Lincoln Cathedral]], where the font is located on the south side of the nave. It has leaves on the corners of the base, with the faces showing "quadrupeds, mostly monstrous",{{sfn|Pevsner, p. 163}} and palmettes on the top. [[Alexander of Lincoln]], Bishop of Lincoln, has usually been credited with the commissioning of the font in Lincoln Cathedral, but recent scholarship has suggested that it was commissioned by his successor, [[Robert de Chesney]].{{sfn|King, pp. 18–19}}

===Suffolk===
====St Peter's, Ipswich====
The font is from c. 1170-90, resting on a 15th-century base, and is at the west end of the nave.{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}} One each face of the font are three lions [[Charge (heraldry)#Attitude of animals|statant gardant]], with pillars separating them. It has been argued that the position of the lions on each face, with the lion at each anglew facing outwards, was to avoid the lions pointing their rear ends towards the altar, but this has been questioned.{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}} The font used to be located close to the west respond of the south nave arcade.{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}}

===Fragment===
A fragment of the bowl of a Tournai font was found in Ipswich and is now in [[Ipswich Museum]].{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}} It has been suggested that it came from the nearby [[Priory of the Holy Trinity, Ipswich|Christchurch priory]].{{sfn|Blatchley and Haward, p. 3}}

===Disputed examples===
The original list of seven fonts was made by Allen and Kitchen in an 1894 article. There have subsequently been three suggested additions:
:*[[Romsey Abbey]], Hampshire. This existence of this font, apparently destroyed in a fire of 1850, has never been verified.{{sfn|Drake (2010)}} 
:*[[St Mary the Virgin, Iffley]], Oxfordshire. This black limestone font is unlike any of the known Tournai fonts.{{sfn|CRSBI, St Peter, Ipswich}}
:*St Michael's, [[Boulge]], Suffolk. Pevsner claims this is a Tournai font, albeit one with the relief statuary chipped off, but H. Munro Cautley states that it is Purbeck marble from around 1210.{{sfn|Harris, p. 439}} Drake claims that the finish is too smooth for it ever to have had statuary.{{sfn|Drake (2010)}}

==United States==
A fragment of a Tournai font is in the museum at [[Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania]].{{sfn|Drake (2010), Appendix 2 Belgium: Mosan and Tournai Fonts}}

This modification process must reflect specific language and cultural preferences in the content, images and overall design and requirements of the site – all while maintaining the integrity of the website.  Culturally adapted web sites reduce the amount of required cognitive efforts from visitors of the site to process information, making navigation easier and attitudes toward the web site more favorable.&lt;ref name="Shneor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rotem|date=2014-02-28|title=Influences of culture, geography, and infrastructure on website localization|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1034102170?accountid=14667|journal=Cross Cultural Management|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|access-date=2017-12-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modification of the website must additionally take into consideration the stated purpose of the new website with a focus on the targeted audience/market in the new locale.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI/&gt; Website localization aims to customize a website so that it seems "natural", to its viewers despite cultural differences between the creators and the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shneor|first=Rodem|title=Influences of culture, geography and infrastructure on website localization decisions|journal=Cross Cultural Management: An International Journal|date=2012|volume=19|issue=3|pages=352–374|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=17047475|accessdate=19 March 2014|doi=10.1108/13527601211247099}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Two factors are involved—programming expertise and linguistic/cultural knowledge.&lt;ref name="Payne"/&gt;

The proliferation of website localization is the result of the popularity of computer and Internet users. People all over the world treat the Internet as their main location for information and services. These people do not all speak the same language. As a result, website localization has become one of the primary tools for business global expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Website Localization|url=https://asianabsolute.co.uk/website-localization|publisher=Asian Absolute|accessdate=25 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to website communication across multiple cultures for multiple needs, the Internet has given way to non professional translation practices. Because website localization involves mixed strategies, organizations tend to maintain a global image while using website localization to appeal to local users.&lt;ref name="Pym"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199239306.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199239306-e-028|title = Oxford Handbooks|last=Pym|first=Anthony|date=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge of website localization has become even more important as websites increasingly have the potential to both supplement and replace presence in foreign markets.  As web design becomes more congruent with national culture, it will foster online consumer purchasing.&lt;ref name="Shneor"/&gt; Creators take into account the "language, education level, belief and value systems, [and] traditions and habits" of the target culture in order to optimize results.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;

==Process==
Website localization is more than mere [[translation]].&lt;ref name="Tan"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-08-06/business/0108060190_1_localization-translation-web-sites|title=Translators go beyond language as Web sites cross borders|last=Tan|first=Shannon|date=6 August 2001|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=29 November 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uabN4muG|archivedate=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translating only solves partial language problems. Measurement units must be converted; images and text are modified to appeal to the target culture.&lt;ref name="Tan"/&gt;

The process of website localization is complex and involves three different levels of adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Localization?|url=http://www.gx-localizations.com/about.asp|publisher=GX Localizations|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  First is translation. Website localization involves adapting any text being used into the language of the country. It is important that translation of information be “clear and understandable” to avoid cultural misunderstanding or offense.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; In order to translate, the "target culture" must be known.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=John|title=SIGDOC '99 Proceedings of the 17th annual international conference on Computer documentation|year=1999|publisher=ACM|location=New York, NY|isbn=1-58113-072-4|pages=127–129|url=http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/320000/318569/p127-stanley.pdf?ip=141.213.236.110&amp;id=318569&amp;acc=ACTIVE%20SERVICE&amp;key=B5D9E165A72B697C%2E0A17827594E6F2C8%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35%2E4D4702B0C3E38B35&amp;CFID=419590667&amp;CFTOKEN=40207095&amp;__acm__=1394480330_f23b71ce60f010c26de5d84eebbfbb5b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Second is the actual localization, which includes translation but also involves all other efforts and activities to ensure that the adaptation of textual materials, visual displays, illustrations and graphics are “linguistically and culturally appropriate for the target locale.” &lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; Target locale is understood as the “[[Market segmentation|market segment]] defined by criteria including language, currency, and perhaps educational level or income bracket.” &lt;ref name=PYM&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pym|first=Anthony|title=Website localization|year=2011|url=http://usuaris.tinet.cat/apym/on-line/translation/2009_website_localization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many technical elements which can be localized are: date and time formats, currency formats, number formats, address and telephone number formats, units of measure and connection speed.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt; In order to ensure effective communication during the localization process, it is important to consider the following items: [[information architecture]], theme and navigation, [[graphics]], photographs, audio, and visual.&lt;ref name="Stanley 1999 127–129"/&gt; Third is [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], which involves making sure that the software being used is fully compatible with the technology of the country in question.

There are two important considerations to keep in mind during the process of website localization. The first is to focus on the demands of the user.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt; The readers of the “localized version of the website” want to be able to read and understand the pages in a way that makes sense to them.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  A second consideration is to take into account the goals of the client, whether an institution, government or individual, for example.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;

==Backend localization==
Many elements of a website that are different according to the locale of the client need only minor manual changes by a localizer, or none at all. For example, the system on which the website is created should automatically produce the correct currency symbol based on the country in which the client is located.&lt;ref name=LAKO&gt;{{cite web|last=Lako|first=Cristian|title=The Elements of the Website Localizations Process|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1321921734/abstract?accountid=14667|work=Studia Universitatis Petru Major. Philogia|publisher=Universitatea Petru Maior|accessdate=28 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Website Analytics Software:&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt; This software can be created once generally, and then applied to each of the localized domains.
* Site Search: Results can be reviewed using an algorithm that sifts through possible results using [[metadata]]. For example, a consumer who makes a query in the United States should not be shown a good that can only be purchased in Portugal.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Testimonials: Comments and feedback are often a vital part of a website. Localization efforts usually only include censorship. This can be done largely by software, however human review is sometimes necessary.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;
* Information Storage: [[Databases]] are often used to store large amounts of information. They can be used to store generic data, like product information, as well as more specific information pertaining to certain locales.&lt;ref name=LAKO /&gt;

==The business of website localization==
Using website localization to its best advantage is vital to any business seeking to move into international markets. With more and more companies seeking to tap into these lucrative markets, website localization has become quite profitable.&lt;ref name=SANDRINI /&gt;  The business side involves global and local coordination; production and operations, including finance; sales and marketing; language translation, including technology and linguistic coordination; software engineering, as well as design.&lt;ref name=PYM /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wandrianne|first=Dias|title=The Business Behind Translation|url=http://www.ccaps.net/blog/the-business-behind-translation/|accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The higher the technological abilities of the target culture, the more likely it is for website localization to be implemented and used effectively.&lt;ref name=Shneor /&gt;
