__NOTOC__
'''5x5=25''' was a two-part [[abstract art]] exhibition held in September–October 1921 in [[Moscow]]. The five artists whose work was shown were [[Aleksandra Ekster]], [[Lyubov Popova]], [[Alexander Rodchenko]], [[Varvara Stepanova]] and [[Alexander Vesnin]]. They presented highly abstracted, geometric work that rejected [[expressionist]] forms of painting common before the [[World War I]] and pretended to be the "end" or "death" of art.

Rodchenko presented three canvases of a single colour (red, yellow and blue). He saw that his formal research into [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]] had reached completion at this point, and claimed that he had demonstrated the "end of painting".&lt;ref name="artdaily"&gt;[http://www.artdaily.org/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=26647&amp;int_modo=1 Art Daily article on Rodchenko and his role in Constructivism]&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition has been considered an anti-painting manifesto.&lt;ref name="artprof"&gt;[http://www.artprofessor.com/artists/alexander-rodchenko.php Art Professor article on Alexander Rodchenko]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

Lyubov Popova showed canvasses almost bare, puzzling viewers and provoking hail from the critics. Her "flight from painting" influenced [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Mark Rothko]] and [[Ad Reinhardt]].&lt;ref name=AA&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/drawing-a-blank-russian-constructivist-makes-late-tate-debut-1516801.html | title=Drawing a blank: Russian constructivist makes late Tate debut | publisher=[[The Independent]] | author=Arifa Akbar | accessdate=2009-06-25 | location=London | date=January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popova herself did not regard her works as "the end"; on the contrary, she wrote, "all pieces presented here should be regarded as merely preparations for concrete construction".&lt;ref&gt;Gleason, Kenez, Stites, pp. 208-209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander Vesnin presented five&lt;ref name=KM92&gt;Khan-Magomedov, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; abstract [[cubism|cubist]] canvases that appear pure abstractions but were, in fact, ultimate decomposition of human figures.&lt;ref name=KM92/&gt; Vesnin's catalogue cover, in particular, is typical of his book and advertising art of the period:  numbers in two "lines" (5x5 and 25) are offset against the baseline, but this irregularity is "disguised" by angled lines dissecting the space.&lt;ref name=KM93&gt;Khan-Magomedov, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Catalogues of the exhibition were hand-drawn by the artists and contained original artwork that has never been displayed publicly. At least ten unique albums survive in Russia to date.&lt;ref name=KM92/&gt; The 1921 show was reconstructed in 2009 in London's [[Tate|Tate Gallery]]. Modern critics remain divided over the question of whether "death of painting" was a genuine statement of modern art or, indeed, it was a dead end with no future.&lt;ref name=AA/&gt;

The '''art of the Third Reich''' was the government-approved art produced in [[Nazi Germany]] between 1933 and 1945. Upon becoming dictator in 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] gave his personal artistic preference the force of law to a degree rarely known before.

In the case of Germany, the model was to be [[Ancient Greek art|classical Greek]] and [[Roman art]], seen by [[Hitler]] as an art whose exterior form embodied an inner racial ideal.&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; It was, furthermore, to be comprehensible to the average man.&lt;ref name="Richard Overy p335"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 335. {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This art was to be both [[heroic art|heroic]] and [[Romanticism|romantic]].&lt;ref name="Richard Overy p335"/&gt; The Nazis viewed the culture of the [[Weimar period]] with disgust. Their response stemmed partly from conservative [[aesthetics]] and partly from their determination to use culture as [[propaganda]].&lt;ref name="Adam110" /&gt;

==Theory== 
As indicated by historian Henry Grosshans in his book ''Hitler and the Artists'', Adolf Hitler who [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|came to power in 1933]] (quote): "saw Greek and [[Roman art]] as uncontaminated by Jewish influences. Modern art was [perceived by him as] an act of aesthetic violence by the Jews against the German spirit. Such was true to Hitler – wrote Grosshans – even though only [[Max Liebermann|Liebermann]], [[Ludwig Meidner|Meidner]], [[Otto Freundlich|Freundlich]], and [[Marc Chagall]], among those who made significant contributions to the German modernist movement, were Jewish. But Hitler ... took upon himself the responsibility of deciding who, in matters of culture, thought and acted like a Jew."&lt;ref&gt;Grosshans 1983, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; The supposedly "Jewish" nature of art that was indecipherable, distorted, or that represented "depraved" subject matter was explained through the concept of degeneracy, which held that distorted and corrupted art was a symptom of an inferior race.

By propagating the theory of [[degenerate art]], the Nazis combined their [[anti-Semitism]] with their drive to control the culture, thus consolidating public support for both campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts in this regard were unquestionably aided by a popular hostility to Modernism that predated their movement.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Spotts, ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics'', p. 161. {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view that such art had reflected Germany's condition and [[moral bankruptcy]] was widespread, and many artists acted in a manner to overtly undermine or challenge popular values and morality.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 358. {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1990-073-26, München, Haus der Deutschen Kunst.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The ''House of German Art'' in Munich]]

In July 1937, two officially sponsored exhibitions opened in [[Munich]]: ''Entartete Kunst'', (the [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]]), displayed modern art in a deliberately chaotic installation accompanied by defamatory labels that encouraged the public to jeer; in contrast, the ''[[:de:Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung|Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung]]'' (Great German art exhibition) made its premiere amid much pageantry. This exhibition, held at the palatial ''[[Haus der Kunst|Haus der deutschen Kunst]]'' (House of German Art), displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. "The audience entered the portals of the new museum, already dubbed "Palazzo Kitschi" and "Munich Art Terminal", to a stultifying display carefully limited to idealized German peasant families, commercial art nudes, and heroic war scenes, including not just a few works by jurist [[Adolf Ziegler|Ziegler]] himself."&lt;ref name="Nicholas.1995.p.20"&gt;Nicholas.(1995).p.20&lt;/ref&gt; "...The show was essentially a flop and attendance was low. Sales were even worse and Hitler ended up buying most of the works for the government."&lt;ref name="Nicholas.1995.p.20"/&gt; At the end of four months ''Entartete Kunst'' had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung''.&lt;ref name="Adam 1992, pp. 124-125"&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The early twentieth century was characterized by startling changes in artistic styles. In the visual arts, such innovations as [[cubism]], [[Dada]] and [[surrealism]], following hot on the heels of [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[post-Impressionism]] and [[Fauvism]], were not universally appreciated. The majority of people in Germany, as elsewhere, did not care for the new art which many resented as elitist, morally suspect and too often incomprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
During recent years, Germany had become a major center of ''[[avant-garde]]'' art. It was the birthplace of [[Expressionism]] in [[painting]] and [[sculpture]], the [[Atonal music|atonal]] musical compositions of [[Arnold Schoenberg]], and the jazz-influenced work of [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Kurt Weill]]. [[Robert Wiene]]'s'' [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920 film)|The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' and [[Fritz Lang]]'s ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' brought expressionism to [[Film|cinema]].

===Creation of the ''Reichskulturkammer''===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-S34639, Joseph Goebbels und Leni Riefenstahl crop.jpg|thumb|right|Joseph Goebbels with film director [[Leni Riefenstahl]] in 1937]]
In September 1933 the ''[[Reichskulturkammer]]'' (Reich Culture Chamber) was established, with [[Joseph Goebbels]], Hitler's ''Reichminister für Volksaufklärung und Propaganda'' (Reich Minister for Public Enlightenment and [[Propaganda]]) in charge.&lt;ref name="overy361"&gt;Richard Overy, ''The Dictators: Hitler's Germany, Stalin's Russia'', p. 361. {{ISBN|0-393-02030-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual divisions in the Chamber of Culture for the Reich included: "press, radio, literature, movies, theater, music, and visual arts." &lt;ref name="Baez, 2004 pp. 211"&gt;Baez, 2004 pp. 211&lt;/ref&gt; "The purpose of this chamber was to stimulate the [[Aryanization (Nazism)|Aryanization]] of German culture and to prohibit, for example, atonal Jewish music, the blues, surrealism, cubism, and Dadaism." &lt;ref name="Baez, 2004 pp. 211"/&gt;

===Laws targeting culture in the Third Reich===
By 1935 the Reich Culture Chamber had 100,000 members.&lt;ref name="Adam53" /&gt; Goebbels made clear that: "In the future only those who are members of the chamber will be allowed to be productive in our cultural life. Membership is open only to those who fulfil the entrance condition. In this way all unwanted and damaging elements have been excluded."&lt;ref name="Adam53"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless there was, during the period 1933–1934, some confusion within the Party on the question of [[German Expressionism|Expressionism]]. Goebbels and some others believed that the forceful works of such artists as [[Emil Nolde]], [[Ernst Barlach]] and [[Erich Heckel]] exemplified the Nordic spirit; as Goebbels explained, "We National Socialists are not un-modern; we are the carrier of a new modernity, not only in politics and in social matters, but also in art and intellectual matters."&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; However, a faction led by Rosenberg despised Expressionism, leading to a bitter ideological dispute which was settled only in September 1934, when Hitler declared that there would be no place for modernist experimentation in the Reich.

# Document No. 2030-PS: ''Decree Concerning the Duties of the Reich Ministry for Public Enlightenment and Propaganda of June 1933'' stated that: "The Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda has jurisdiction over the whole field of spiritual indoctrination of the nation, of propagandizing the State, of cultural and economic propaganda, of enlightenment of the public at home and abroad; furthermore, he is in charge of the administration of all institutions serving these purposes" &lt;ref&gt;Document No. 2030-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Yale Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; This increased the jurisdiction of the Reich Minister of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda to include "enlightenment in foreign countries; art; art exhibitions; moving pictures and sport abroad" … [and increased jurisdiction in domestic] "Press (including the Institute for Journalism); Radio; National anthem; German Library in Leipzig; Art; Music (including the Philharmonic Orchestra); Theater; Moving Pictures; Campaign against dirty and obscene literature" … Propaganda for tourism." Signed by The Reich Chancellor, Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Document No. 2030-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Yale Law School&lt;/ref&gt;
# Document No. 2078-PS: ''Decree concerning the establishment of the Reichs Ministry of Science, Education and Popular Culture of 1 May 1934'' stated that: "The Chancellor of the Reich will determine the various duties of the Reich Ministry for Science, Education, and Popular Culture." &lt;ref&gt;Document No. 2078-PS. Accessed Feb. 2014. Yale Law School.&lt;/ref&gt; Signed by The President of the Reich, von Hindenburg, and The Chancellor of the Reich, Adolf Hitler.
# Document No. 1708-PS: ''The program of the NSDAP'' stated that: only members of the German race can be citizens (Jews, specifically are denied citizenship), and that non-members of the race can only live in Germany as registered ‘guests’. Point 23 stated: "We demand legal prosecution of artistic and literary forms which exert a destructive influence on our national life, and the closure of organizations opposing the above made demands.&lt;ref&gt;Document No. 1708-PS.

Belief in a Germanic spirit—defined as mystical, rural, moral, bearing ancient wisdom, noble in the face of a tragic destiny—existed long before the rise of the Nazis; [[Richard Wagner]] celebrated such ideas in his work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 23-24&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning before World War I the well-known German architect and painter [[Paul Schultze-Naumburg]]'s influential writings, which invoked racial theories in condemning modern art and architecture, supplied much of the basis for Adolf Hitler's belief that classical Greece and the Middle Ages were the true sources of Aryan art.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 29-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi art bears a close similarity to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] propaganda art style of [[Socialist Realism]], and the term [[heroic realism]] has sometimes been used to describe both artistic styles. Among the well-known artists endorsed by the Nazis were the sculptors [[Josef Thorak]] and [[Arno Breker]], and painters [[Werner Peiner]], [[Arthur Kampf]], [[Adolf Wissel]] and [[Conrad Hommel]]. In July 1937, four years after it came to power, the Nazi party put on two art exhibitions in [[Munich]]. The Great German Art Exhibition was designed to show works that Hitler approved of, depicting statuesque blonde nudes along with idealized soldiers and landscapes. The second exhibition, just down the road, showed the other side of [[German art]]: modern, abstract, non-representational—or as the Nazis saw it, "degenerate".

According to Klaus Fischer, "Nazi art, in short, was colossal, impersonal, and stereotypical. People were shorn of all individuality and became mere emblems expressive of assumed eternal truths. In looking at Nazi architecture, art, or painting one quickly gains the feeling that the faces, shapes, and colors all serve a propagandistic purpose; they are all the same stylized statements of Nazi virtues—power, strength, solidity, Nordic beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.368&lt;/ref&gt;

===Painting===

Art of the Third Reich was characterized by a style of [[Romantic realism]] based on [[Greek art|classical models]]. While banning modern styles as [[Degenerate art|degenerate]], the Nazis promoted paintings that were narrowly traditional in manner and that exalted the "[[blood and soil]]" values of [[racial purity]], [[militarism]], and [[Obedience (human behavior)#Cultural attitudes to obedience|obedience]]. Other popular themes for Nazi art were the [[Volk (German word)#Nazi era|Volk]] at work in the fields, a return to the simple virtues of [[Heimat]] (love of homeland), the manly virtues of the National Socialist struggle, and the lauding of the female activities of child bearing and raising symbolized by the phrase ''[[Kinder, Küche, Kirche]]'' ("children, kitchen, church").

In general, painting—once purged of "degenerate art"—was based on traditional [[genre painting]].&lt;ref name="Adam110"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Titles were purposeful: "Fruitful Land", "Liberated Land", "Standing Guard", "Through Wind and Weather", "Blessing of Earth", and the like.&lt;ref name="Adam110" /&gt; Hitler's favorite painter was [[Adolf Ziegler]] and Hitler owned a number of his works. [[Landscape painting]] featured prominently in the Great German Art exhibition.&lt;ref name="Frederic Spotts p 176"&gt;Frederic Spotts, ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics'', p 176 {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; While drawing on [[German Romanticism]] traditions, it was to be firmly based on real landscape, Germans' [[Lebensraum]], without religious moods.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; Peasants were also popular images, reflecting a simple life in harmony with nature.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; This art showed no sign of the mechanization of farm work.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The farmer labored by hand, with effort and struggle.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; Not a single painting in the first exhibition showed urban or industrialized life, and only two in the exhibition in 1938.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Grunberger]], ''The 12-Year Reich'', p. 427, {{ISBN|0-03-076435-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi theory explicitly rejected "materialism", and therefore, despite the realistic treatment of images, "realism" was a seldom used term.&lt;ref name="Adam138"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; A painter was to create an ideal picture, for eternity.&lt;ref name="Adam138" /&gt; The images of men, and still more of women, were heavily stereotyped,&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; with physical perfection required for the nude paintings.&lt;ref name="sontag3"&gt;[[Susan Sontag]]",[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1975/feb/06/fascinating-fascism/?page=3 Fascinating Fascism]"&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been the cause of there being very few anti-Semitic paintings; while such works as ''Um Haus and Hof'', depicting a Jewish speculator dispossessing an elderly peasant couple exist, they are few, perhaps because the art was supposed to be on a higher plane.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Explicitly political paintings were more common but still very rare.&lt;ref name="Frederic Spotts p 176"/&gt; Heroic imagery, on the other hand, was common enough to be commented on by a critic: "The heroic element stands out. The worker, the farmer, the soldier are the themes .... Heroic subjects dominate over sentimental ones".&lt;ref name="censure"&gt;''[http://thecensureofdemocracy.150m.com/art5.htm The Greater German Art Exhibitions]'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131032526/http://thecensureofdemocracy.150m.com/art5.htm |date=January 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of war, [[military art|war paintings]] became far more common.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; The images were romanticized, depicting heroic sacrifice and victory.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Still, landscapes predominated, and among the painters exempted from war service, all were noted for landscapes or other pacific subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Frederic Spotts, ''Hitler and the Power of Aesthetics'', pp. 176-178. {{ISBN|1-58567-345-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Hitler and Goebbels found the new paintings disappointing, although Goebbels tried to put a good face on it with the observation that they had cleared the field, and that these desperate times drew many talents into political life rather than cultural.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech at the ''Great German Art Exhibition'' in Munich Hitler said in 1939:

{{quote|The first goal of our new German creation of art [...] has surely been achieved. Analogous to the recovering of architectural art which began here in Munich, here also started the purification in the sphere of painting and sculpture, that maybe had been even more devastated. The whole swindle of a decadent or pathological trend-art has been swept away. A decent common level has been reached. And this means a lot. Only out of this can the truly creative genius arise."&lt;ref&gt;Max Domarus, Hitler: Reden und Proklamationen 1932–1945. Kommentiert von einem Zeitzeugen. Wiesbaden, 1973, page 1218, {{ISBN|3-927068-00-4}}. Original Text: "... das erste Ziel unseres neuen deutschen Kunstschaffens [...] ohne Zweifel schon heute erreicht [sei]. So wie von dieser Stadt München die baukünstlerische Gesundung ihren Ausgang nahm, hat hier auch vor drei Jahren die Reinigung eingesetzt auf dem vielleicht noch mehr verwüsteten Gebiet der Plastik und der Malerei. Der ganze Schwindelbetrieb einer dekadenten oder krankhaften, verlogenen Modekunst ist hinweggefegt. Ein anständiges allgemeines Niveau wurde erreicht. Und dieses ist sehr viel. Denn aus ihm erst können sich die wahrhaft schöpferischen Genies erheben." (07/14/1939)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By 1938, nearly 16,000 works by German and non-German artists had been seized from German galleries and either sold abroad or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley 1997, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sculpture===
[[Image:Arno Breker, Albert Speer (1940).jpg|thumb|250px|[[Arno Breker]] sculpting a bust of [[Albert Speer]], the Reich armaments minister]]

The monumental possibilities of sculpture offered greater material expression of the theories of [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="Adam177"&gt;Adam 1992, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Great German Art Exhibition'' promoted the genre of sculpture at the expense of painting.&lt;ref name="Adam177" /&gt; As such, the nude male was the most common representation of the ideal Aryan; the artistic skill of [[Arno Breker]] elevated him to become the favourite sculptor of Adolf Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 Caroline Fetscher, "Why Mention Arno Breker Today?", ''The Atlantic Times'', August 2006.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211083704/http://www.atlantic-times.com/archive_detail.php?recordID=602 |date=2012-02-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Josef Thorak]] was another official sculptor whose monumental style suited the image the Third Reich wished to communicate to the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,821298,00.html Art: Bigger Than Life]"&lt;/ref&gt; Nude females were also common, though they tended to be less monumental.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the physical form of the ideal Nazi man and woman showed no imperfections.&lt;ref name="sontag3"/&gt;

===Music===
Music was expected to be [[Tonality|tonal]] and free of [[jazz]] influence; [[Nazism and cinema|films]] and plays were [[censorship|censored]]. "Musical fare alternated between light music in the form of folk songs or popular hits (''Schlager'') and such acceptable classical music as [[Bach]], [[Mozart]], [[Beethoven]], and Italian Opera."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.371&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany's urban centers in the 1920s and 30s were buzzing with jazz clubs, cabaret houses and avant garde music. In contrast, the National Socialist regime made concentrated efforts to shun modern music (which was considered degenerate and Jewish in nature) and instead embraced classical German music. Highly favored was music which alluded to a mythic, heroic German past such as [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] and [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Anton Bruckner]] was highly favored as his music was regarded as an expression of the [[zeitgeist]] of the German [[volk]].&lt;ref&gt;Eyerman &amp; Jamison 1998&lt;/ref&gt; The music of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (and atonal music along with it), [[Gustav Mahler]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and many others was banned because the composers were Jewish or of Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Levi 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Hindemith]] fled to Switzerland in 1938,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinberg|first=Michael|title=The Concerto : A Listener's Guide|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019802634X|page=205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t8oXNX2tY8AC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than fit his music into Nazi ideology. Some operas of [[Georg Friederich Händel]] were either banned outright for themes sympathetic to Jews and Judaism or had new librettos written for them. German composers who had their music performed more often during the Nazi period were [[Max Reger]] and [[Hans Pfitzner]]. [[Richard Strauss]] continued to be the most performed contemporary German composer, as he had been prior to the Nazi regime. However, even Strauss had his opera [[Die Schweigsame Frau|The Silent Woman]] banned in 1935 due to his Jewish librettist [[Stefan Zweig]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi 1994, page 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Music by non-German composers was tolerated if it was classically inspired, tonal, and not by a composer of Jewish origin or having ties to ideologies hostile to the Third Reich. The Nazis recognized [[Franz Liszt]] for having German origin and fabricated a genealogy that purported that [[Frédéric Chopin]] was German, and the Nazi [[Hans Frank|Governor-General of occupied Poland]] even had a "Chopin Museum" built in [[Kraków]]. Music of the Russian [[Peter Tchaikovsky]] could be performed in Nazi Germany even after [[Operation Barbarossa]]. Operas by [[Gioacchino Rossini]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and [[Giacomo Puccini]] got frequent play.  The most performed modern non-German composers prior to the outbreak of war were [[Claude Debussy]], [[Maurice Ravel]], [[Jean Sibelius]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Levi, page 217.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the outbreak of war, the music of German allies became more often performed, including the Hungarian [[Béla Bartók]], the Italian [[Ottorino Resphigi]] and Finnish Jean Sibelius. Composers of enemy nations (such as Debussy, Ravel and Stravinsky) were largely banned and almost never performed – although there were some exceptions.

There has been controversy over the use of certain composers' music by the Nazi regime, and whether that implicates the composer as implicitly Nazi. Composers such as Richard Strauss,&lt;ref&gt;Potter 1992&lt;/ref&gt; who served as the first director of the Propaganda Ministry's music division, and [[Carl Orff]] have been subject to extreme criticism and heated defense.&lt;ref&gt;Kater 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kater 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Jews were quickly prohibited from performing or conducting classical music in Germany. Such conductors as [[Otto Klemperer]], [[Bruno Walter]], [[Ignatz Waghalter]], [[Josef Krips]], and [[Kurt Sanderling]] fled Germany. Upon the Nazi seizure of Czechoslovakia, the conductor [[Karel Ančerl]] was blacklisted as a Jew and was sent in turn to [[Theresienstadt]] and [[Auschwitz]].

====Musicologists of the Third Reich====
As the Nazi regime accrued power in 1933, musicologists were directed to rewrite the history of German music in order to accommodate Nazi mythology and ideology. [[Richard Wagner]] and [[Hans Pfitzner]] were notable preexisting composers who conceptualized a united order (''Volksgemeinschaft'') where music was an index of the German community. In a time of disintegration, Wagner and Pfitzner wanted to revitalize the country through music. In a book written about Hans Pfitzner and Wagner, published in Regensburg in 1939 followed not only the birth of contemporary musical parties, but also of political parties in Germany. The Wagner-Pfitzner stance contrasted ideas of other notable artists—[[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Theodor W. Adorno]]—who wanted music to be autonomous from politics, Nazi control and application. Although Wagner and Pfitzner came before the Third Reich, their sentiments and thoughts, Wagner's ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'', were appropriated by Hitler and his propagandists—notably [[Joseph Goebbels]]. According to Michael Meyer, "The very emphasis on rootedness and on tradition music underscored Nazi understanding of itself in a dialectic terms: old gods were mobilized against the false values of the immediate past to offer legitimacy to the epiphany of Adolf Hitler and the music representation of his realm."{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Composers, librettists, educators, critics, and especially musicologists, through their public statements, intellectual writings, and journals contributed to the justification of a totalitarian blueprint to be implanted through nazification. All music was then composed for the occasions of Nazi pageantries, rallies, and conventions. Composers dedicated so called 'consecration fanfares,' inaugurations fanfares and flag songs to the Fuhrer. When the Fuhrer assumed power the Nazi revolution was immediately expressed in musicological journalism. Certain progressive journalism pertaining to modern music was purged. Journals that had been sympathetic to the ‘German viewpoint,’ entrenched in Wagnerian ideals, like the ''Zeitschrift für Musik'' and ''Die Musik'', showed confidence in the new regime and affirmed the process of intertwining government policies with music. Joseph Goebbels used the ''Völkischer Beobachter'', a journal that was disseminated to the general public in addition to elites and party officials, as an organ of Reich Culture. By the end of the 1930s the ''Mitteilungen der Reichsmusikkammer'' became another prominent journal that reflected the music policy, organizational and personnel changes in musical institutions.

In the early years of the Third Reich, the musicologists and musicians redirected the orientation of music, defining what was "German Music" and what was not. Nazi ideology was applied to the evaluation of musicians for hero status; musicians defined in the new German musical era were given titles of prophets, while their accomplishments and deeds were seen as direct accomplishments of the Nazi regime. The contribution of German musicologists led to the justification of Nazi power and a new German music culture in whole. The musicologists defined the greater German values that musicians would have to identify with, because their duty was to integrate music and National Socialism in way that made them look inseparable. Nazi myth making and ideology was forced upon the new musical path of the Third Reich rather than truly embedded in the rhetoric of German music.

===Graphic design===
The poster became an important medium for propaganda during this period. Combining text and bold graphics, posters were extensively deployed both in Germany and in the areas occupied. Their [[typography]] reflected the Nazis' official ideology. The use of [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]] was common in Germany until 1941, when [[Martin Bormann]] denounced the typeface as "Judenlettern" and decreed that only [[Roman type]] should be used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/tools/citex?clienttype=1&amp;subtype=1&amp;mode=1&amp;version=1&amp;id=118830484&amp;redirect=/journal/118830484/abstract/ Newton, Gerald, 2003, "''Deutsche Schrift'': The Demise and Rise of German Black Letter", ''German Life and Letters'', 56:2 (abstract).]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[sans-serif]] typefaces were condemned as [[cultural Bolshevism]], although [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]] continued to be used owing to its practicality.&lt;ref&gt;Hollis 2001, pp. 66-67&lt;/ref&gt; Imagery frequently drew on [[heroic realism]].&lt;ref name="design"&gt;eye magazine, "[http://www.eyemagazine.com/feature.php?id=62&amp;fid=270 Designing heroes]"&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi youth and the SS were depicted monumentally, with lighting posed to produce grandeur.&lt;ref name="design"/&gt;
Graphic design also played a part in the Third Reich through the use of the [http://www.dailyslave.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/swastika2.jpg swastika.]&lt;ref name="Hitler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://life.time.com/world-war-ii/nazi-propaganda-and-the-myth-of-aryan-invincibility/#1 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103024627/http://life.time.com/world-war-ii/nazi-propaganda-and-the-myth-of-aryan-invincibility/ |archivedate=2014-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The swastika was in existence long before Hitler came into power—serving purposes that were much more benign than the ones it [the swastika] is associated with today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.typotheque.com/articles/the_swastika_constructing_the_symbol|title=Typotheque: The Swastika: Constructing The Symbol by Steven Heller|author=|date=|website=www.typotheque.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the stark, graphic lines used to create a swastika, it was a symbol that was very easy to remember.&lt;ref name= "Hitler"/&gt;

===Literature===
The Reich Chamber of Literature ''Reichsschriftstumskammer''&lt;ref&gt;Mosse 1966, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;
Literature was under the jurisdiction of Goebbels's Ministry of Propaganda and Popular Enlightenment. According to Grunberger, "At the beginning of the war this department supervised no less than 2,500 publishing houses, 23,000 bookshops, 3,000 authors, 50 national literary prizes, 20,000 new books issued annually, and a total of 1 million titles constituting the available book market."&lt;ref name="Grunberger 1971, p. 361"&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 361&lt;/ref&gt; Germany was Europe's biggest producer of books—in terms both of total annual production and the number of individual new titles appearing each year.&lt;ref&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, at 650 million RM, the average sales value of the books produced took third place in the statistics on goods, after coal and wheat.&lt;ref&gt;Barbian 2010, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; The first National Socialist literature commission, set itself the goal of eradicating the literature of the ‘System Period’, as Weimar was contemptuously called, and of propagating volkisch-nationalist literature in the Nazis state.&lt;ref name="Barbian 2010, pp. 27-28"&gt;Barbian 2010, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt; Literature was recognized early on as an essential political tool in the Third Reich as virtually 100 percent of the German population was literate.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley 1997, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; "The most widely-read-or displayed-book of the period was Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'', a collection (according to [[Lion Feuchtwanger]]) of 164,000 offences against German grammar and syntax; by 1940, it was, with 6 million copies sold, the solitary front-runner in the German best-seller list, some 5 million copies ahead of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]] and others."&lt;ref name="Grunberger 1971, p. 361"/&gt;

Richard Grunberger says, "In 1936 literary criticism as hitherto understood was abolished; henceforth reviews followed a pattern: a synopsis of content studded with quotations, marginal comments on style, a calculation of the degree of concurrence with Nazi doctrine and a conclusion indicating approval or otherwise."&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 357&lt;/ref&gt;

The Third Reich permitted much foreign literature to be read, in part because they believed that the writings of authors such as [[John Steinbeck]] and [[Erskine Caldwell]] substantiated the Nazis' condemnation of Western society as corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the United States entered the war, all foreign authors were strictly censored. Themes in Nazi literature were defined as a range of "permissible literary expression" largely limited to four subjects: war, [[Nazism and race]], [[blood and soil]], and the [[Nazi movement]]."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, pp. 368&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Fronterlebnis'' (War as a Spiritual Experience)====

This was one of the most popular themes during the interwar period. Writers celebrated the "heroics of front-line soldiers in [World War I], ... the thrill of combat and the sacredness of death when it is in the service of the fatherland."&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"/&gt; Popular writers in this genre included [[Ernst Jünger]] and Werner Beumelburg [[:de:Werner Beumelburg|(de)]], an ex-officer.&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"&gt;Fischer 1997, pp. 368–369&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent books include [[Ernst Junger]]'s ''Storm of Steel'' (1920), ''Struggle as Inner Experience'' (1922), ''Storms'' (1933), ''Fire and Blood'' (1925), ''The Adventurous Heart'' (1929), and ''Total Mobilization'' (1931).

====''Blut und Boden'' (Blood and Soil)====

Novels in this theme often featured an instinctive and soil-bound peasant community that warded off alien outsiders who sought to destroy their way of life.&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"/&gt; 
The most popular novel of this kind was [[Hermann Lons]]'s ''[[Der Wehrwolf|Wehrwolf]]'' published in 1910.

====Historical ethnicity====
Klaus Fischer says Nazi literature emphasized "Historic Ethnicity—that is, how a group of people defines itself in a process of historical growth. Writers tried to highlight prominent episodes in the history of the German people; they stressed the German mission for Europe, analyzed the immutable racial essence of Nordic man, and warned against subversive or un-German forces—the Jews, Communists, or Western liberals."&lt;ref name="Fischer 1997, pp. 368-369"/&gt; Prominent writers included: [[Erwin Guido Kolbenheyer]] (''Die Bauhutte: Elemente einer Metaphysik der Gerenwart''; The building hut: Elements of a contemporary metaphysics, 1925), [[Alfred Rosenberg]] (''Der Mythus des 20.Jahrhunderts''; The myth of the twentieth century, 1930), [[Josef Weinheber]], [[Hans Grimm]] (''Volk ohne Raum''; People [[Lebensraum|without living space]], 1926), and [[Joseph Goebbels]] (''Michael'', 1929).

===Architecture===
{{main|Nazi architecture}}
Hitler favored hugeness, especially in architecture, as a means of impressing the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Pauley 1997, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; "A once mediocre artist and aspiring architect, Hitler also pronounced upon the "decadence" of modern art and pushed his planners to create monumental buildings in older [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] or [[art deco]] styles." &lt;ref&gt;Sivers, Desnoyers and Stow 2012, p.1008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre and cinema===
{{main|Nazism and cinema}}
"The Reich Film Chamber (''Reichsfilmkammer'') controlled the lively German film industry, while a Film Credit Bank (also under Goebbels' control) centralized the financial aspects of film production." &lt;ref&gt;Mosse 1966, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 1363 feature pictures were made in the Third Reich (208 of these were banned after World War II for containing Nazi Propaganda).&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1969, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Every film made in the Third Reich (including features, shorts, newsreels, and documentaries) had to be passed by Joseph Goebbels himself before they could be shown in public.&lt;ref&gt;Hull 1969, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Plakat_der_ewige_Jude,_1937.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for ''The Eternal Jew'' exhibition, 1937]]
Mass culture was less stringently regulated than high culture, possibly because the authorities feared the consequences of too heavy-handed interference in popular entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 1996, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, until the outbreak of the war, most Hollywood films could be screened, including ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', ''[[San Francisco (1936 film)|San Francisco]]'', and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''. While performance of atonal music was banned, the prohibition of jazz was less strictly enforced. [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Django Reinhardt]] were popular, and leading English and American jazz bands continued to perform in major cities until the war; thereafter, dance bands officially played "swing" rather than the banned jazz.&lt;ref&gt;Laqueur 1996, pp. 73–75&lt;/ref&gt;

A film premiered in Berlin on November 28, 1940, which was clearly a tool used to promote Nazi Ideology. The release of the film ''[[The Eternal Jew (1940 film)|Der ewige Jude]]'' (The Eternal Jew) was only two months prior to the announcement made by German officials of the establishment of the ghetto in [[Łódź]]. The film was portrayed in the Nazi press as a documentary to emphasize the cinema as truth, when in reality it was nothing more than propaganda to raise hatred against the Jewish community in its viewers.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009, pp. 80, 81&lt;/ref&gt;

The filmmaker, [[Fritz Hippler]], used numerous visual techniques to portray Jews as a filthy, degenerate, and disease infested population. Purporting to provide the viewer with an in depth look at the Jewish lifestyle, the film showed staged scenes of Łódź (soon to be ghetto) with the presence of flies and rats, to suggest a dangerous-to-life area of Europe; which in turn only perpetuated underlying superstition and fear to the viewer. To add to this staged and exaggerated scene of filth was a warning released by officials of The [[Reich]]: an advisory that Łódź is an area of widespread infectious disease. The film director utilized racist cinema to bolster the illusion that Jews were parasites and corruptors of German culture.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009, pp. 80, 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Hippler made use of [[voice-over]]s to cite hate speeches or fictitious statistics of the Jewish population. He also borrowed numerous scenes from other films, and presented them out of context from the original: for example, a scene of a Jewish businessman in the United States hiding money was accompanied with a bogus claim that Jewish men get taxed more than non-Jews in the United States, which was used to insinuate that Jews withhold money from the government. Through the repetitive use of side angles of Jewish people, who were filmed (without knowledge) while looking over their shoulder at the camera, ''Der ewige Jude'' created a visual suggesting a shifty and conspiring nature of Jews. Yet another propaganda technique was superposition. Hippler superimposed the [[Star of David]] onto the tops of world capitals, insinuating an illusion of Jewish world domination.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009, pp. 84–86&lt;/ref&gt;
	
''Der ewige Jude'' is notorious for its anti-Semitism and its use of cinema in the fabrication of propaganda, to satisfy Hitler and to embrace the Germanic ideology that would fuel a nation in support of an obsessive leader.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
"On the lighter side, a Jewish actor named Leo Reuss fled Germany to Vienna, where he dyed his hair and beard and became a specialist in ‘Aryan’ roles, which were greatly praised by the Nazis. Having had his fun, Reuss revealed he was a Jew, signed a contract with MGM, and departed for the United States" &lt;ref name="Hull 1969, p. 127"&gt;Hull 1969, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hitler Museum==

Apart from auctioning art that was to be purged from Germany's collection, Germany's art that was considered as especially favourable by Hitler were to be combined to create a massive art museum in Hitler's hometown of [[Linz]], Austria for his own personal collection. The museum to-be by 1945 had thousands of pieces of furniture, paintings, sculptures and several other forms of fine craft. The museum was to be known as the "[[Führermuseum]]". By the late spring of 1940 art collectors and museum curators were in a race against time to move thousands of pieces of collectables into hiding, or out of soon-to-be-occupied territory where it would be vulnerable to confiscation by German officials—either for themselves, or for the Führer. On June 5, a particularly important movement of thousands of paintings occurred, which included the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'', and all were hidden in the Loc-Dieu Abbey located near [[Martiel]] during the chaos of invasion by German forces. Art dealers did their best to hide artwork in the best places possible; [[Paul Rosenberg (art dealer)|Paul Rosenberg]] managed to move over 150 great pieces to a [[Libourne]] bank, which included works by [[Monet]], [[Matisse]], Picasso, and van Gogh. Other collectors did whatever they could to remove France's artistic treasures to the safest locations feasible at the time; filling cars, or large crates en route to [[Vichy]], or south through France and into Spain to reach transport by boat. Art dealer Martin Fabiani moved mass quantities of pictures: drawings and paintings to be boarded onto a ship so that the prized possessions were to be in safer keeping on British soil in [[Bermuda]], although when the ship's contents arrived, complications arose over proof of ownership of foreign assets from France. British consuls were wary of exports and carefully inspected shipments from France, after which Fabiani's assets were relocated to Canada, in the charge of the [[Registrar General of Canada|Registrar]] of the [[Exchequer Court of Canada]] where they were to remain until the end of the war. Similar shipments landed in New York, all in an effort to protect artistic treasures from confiscation, theft, and destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of June, Hitler controlled most of the European continent. As people were detained, their possessions were confiscated; if they were lucky enough to escape, their belongings left behind or in storage became the property of Germany. By the end of August, officials of the Reich were granted permission to access any shipping containers and remove any desirable items inside. As well as looting goods that were to be shipped out of occupied territories, [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]] authorized the removal of any objects found in houses during the invasion, after which a long and thorough search was in effect for European treasures.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Adolf Hitler in Paris 1940.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Speer]], [[Adolf Hitler]], and [[Arno Breker]], in Paris (1940)]]

Artwork became an important commodity in the German economy: no one in German or axis-controlled countries was allowed to invest outside of the new Germanic-controlled territory, which in turn created a self-contained market. With few options available for investments, art was of great importance to anyone with cash, including the [[Führer]] himself, as a safe form of investment, and even in trade for the lives of others. At the height of trading in 1943, art was used by [[Pieter de Boers]], who was the head of Dutch association of Art Dealers, and the largest seller to Germans in the Netherlands, in the exchange of the release of his Jewish employee. Demand began to increase dramatically, forcing prices to rise, and only furthering the desire to discover hidden treasures within occupied territory.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;

As exploration continued within [[occupied France]], and by order of the Führer, a list was created which included all of the great works of art in France, and the German Currency Unit began to open private bank units which contained countless collectors' property and possible items on the list. The owner of the vault was required to be present. One particular investigation of a vault was that of Pablo Picasso; he chose a rather clever tactic when soldiers searched the contents of his vault. He packed his own artworks with countless other artists’ works of his collection in a chaotic manner, with the result that the investigators thought that nothing in the collection was significant, and took nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

As confiscations began to pile up in massive quantities, the items filled the Louvre, and forced Reich officials to use the [[Jeu de Paume]], a small museum, for additional space, and for proper viewing of the collection. The grand stockpile of art was ready for Hitler to choose from: the Führer had first choice for his own collection; second were objects that would complete collections of the [[Reichsmarschall]]; third was intended for whatever was useful to support Nazi ideology; a fourth category was created for German museums. Everything was supposed to be appraised and paid for, with proceeds being directed to French war-orphans.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, pp. 125,126,128,129&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler also ordered the confiscation of French works of art owned by the state and the cities. Reich officials decided what was to stay in France, and what was to be sent to [[Linz]]. Further orders from the Führer also included the return of artworks that were looted by [[Napoleon]] from Germany in the past. Napoleon is considered the unquestioned record holder in the act of confiscating art.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art theft===
{{main|Nazi plunder}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-729-0001-23, Italien, Überführung von Kunstschätzen.jpg|thumb|280px|German soldiers of the [[Hermann Göring Division]] posing in front of [[Palazzo Venezia]] in Rome in 1944 with a picture taken from the Biblioteca del [[Naples National Archaeological Museum|Museo Nazionale di Napoli]] before the Allied forces' arrival in the city ''Carlo III di Borbone che visita il papa Benedetto XIV nella coffee-house del Quirinale a Roma'' by [[Giovanni Paolo Pannini]] ([[Museo di Capodimonte]] inv. Q 205)]]
Later, as the occupiers of Europe, the Germans trawled the museums and private collections of Europe for suitably "Aryan" art to be acquired to fill a bombastic new gallery in Hitler's home town of [[Linz]]. At first a pretense was made of exchanges of works (sometimes with [[Impressionism|Impressionist]] masterpieces, considered degenerate by the Nazis), but later acquisitions came through forced "donations" and eventually by simple looting.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/articles-and-papers/symposium-papers/conducting-research-art-looting.html Conducting Research at the National Archives into Art Looting, Recovery, and Restitution] by Ernest Latham, US National Archives&lt;/ref&gt;

The purge of art in Germany and occupied countries was extremely broad. The Nazi theft is considered to be the largest art theft in modern history including paintings, furniture, sculptures, and anything in between considered either valuable, or opposing Hitler's purification of German culture. During the Second World War, art theft by German forces was devastating, and the resurfacing of missing stolen art continues today, along with the fight for rightful ownership. Not only did the [[Reich]] confiscate and reallocate countless masterpieces from occupied territories during the war, but also put to auction a large portion of Germany's collection of great art from museums and art galleries. In the end, the confiscation committees removed over 15,000 works of art from German public collections alone.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Warsaw 1944 by Bałuk - 26320.jpg|thumb|left|Column of lorries in front of a [[Zachęta|Warsaw museum]] [[World War II looting of Poland|loaded with stolen art treasures]], 1944]]

It took four years to "refine" the Nazi art criteria; in the end what was tolerated was whatever Hitler liked, and whatever was most useful to the German government from the point of view of creating propaganda. A thorough head-hunting of artists within Germany was in effect from the beginning of the Second World War, which included the elimination of countless members within the art community. Museum directors that supported modern art were attacked; artists that refused to comply with Reich-approved art were forbidden to practice art altogether. To enforce the prohibition of practicing art, agents of the [[Gestapo]] routinely made unexpected visits to artist's homes and studios. Wet brushes found during the inspections or even the smell of turpentine in the air was reason enough for arrest. In response to the oppressive restrictions, many artists chose to flee Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, pp. 10-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Degenerate-Auction.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A confiscated self-portrait by [[Vincent van Gogh]] is auctioned at Gallerie Fisher, Lucerne, in 1939. The winning bid was $US 40,000 by Dr. Frankfurter.&lt;ref&gt;Hammerstingl, Werner (1998). [http://www.olinda.com/ArtAndIdeas/lectures/ArtWeDontLike/entarteteKunst.htm "Entartete Kunst"], olinda.com. Retrieved December 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;

Before the impending war and a time of simply looting occupied nation's art treasures, but during the Reich's efforts to free Germany of conflicting art, authorities of the Nazi party realized the potential revenue of Germany's own collection of art that was considered [[degenerate art]] which was to be purged from German culture. The Reich began to collect and auction countless pieces of art—for example, "on June 30, 1939 a major auction took place at the elegant Grand Hotel National in the Swiss resort town of [[Lucerne]]".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; All of the paintings and sculptures had recently been on display in museums throughout Germany. This collection offered over 100 paintings and sculptures by numerous famous artists, such as [[Henri Matisse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], and [[Pablo Picasso]]; all of which were considered "degenerate" pieces by Nazi authorities and were to be banished from Germany. An auction of this magnitude was viewed as suspicious by potential buyers, who feared that the profits would end up funding the Nazi party: "The auctioneer had been so worried about this perception that he had sent letters to leading dealers assuring them that all profits would be used for German museums".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, all of the proceeds from the auction were deposited into "German controlled-accounts", and the museums "... as all had suspected, did not receive a penny".&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Individual NSDAP artists==
According to Klaus Fischer – "Many German writers, artists, musicians, and scientists not only stayed but flourished under the Nazis, including some famous names such as [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Max Planck]], [[Gerhart Hauptmann]], [[Gottfried Benn]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and many others".&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, pp.374-375&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1944 the [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda]] prepared a list of 1,041 artists considered crucial to National Socialist culture, and therefore exempt from war service. This [[Gottbegnadeten list]] provides a well-documented index to the painters, sculptors, architects and filmmakers who were regarded by the Nazis as politically sympathetic, culturally valuable, and still residing in Germany at this late stage of the war.

{{main|Degenerate art}}
Hitler's rise to power on January 31, 1933, was quickly followed by actions intended to cleanse the culture of degeneracy: [[book burnings]] were organized, artists and musicians were dismissed from teaching positions, artists were forbidden to utilize any colors not apparent in nature, to the "normal eye",&lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; and curators who had shown a partiality to modern art were replaced by Nazi Party members.&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; "Through the Ministry of Propaganda or the ERR, the Nazis destroyed or quarantined the culture of all the nations they invaded."&lt;ref name="Baez 2004, p. 211"&gt;Baez 2004, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; "A four-man purge tribunal (Professor Ziegler, Schweitzer-Mjolnir, Count Baudissin and Wolf willrich) toured galleries and museums all over the Reich and ordered the removal of paintings, drawings and sculptures that were regarded as 'degenerate'." &lt;ref&gt;Grunberger 1971, p. 424&lt;/ref&gt; "The swathe these four apocalyptic Norsemen cut through Germany's stored-up artistic treasure has been estimated at upwards of 16,000 paintings, drawings, etchings and sculptures: 1,000 pieces by [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]], 700 by [[Haeckel]], 600 each by [[Schmidt-Rottluff]] and [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner|Kirchner]], 500 by [[Beckmann]], 400 by [[Kokoschka]], 300-400 each by [[Hofer]], [[Max Pechstein|Pechstein]], [[Barlach]], [[Feininger]] and [[Otto Muller]], 200-300 each by [[Otto Dix|Dix]], [[Grosz]] and [[Corinth]], 100 by [[Wilhelm Lehmbruck|Lehmbruck]], as well as much smaller numbers of [[Cézanne]]s, [[Picasso]]s, Matisses, [[Gauguin]]s, [[Van Gogh]]s, Braques, Pisarros, Dufys, Chiricos and [[Max Ernst]]."&lt;ref name="Grunberger.1971.p.425"&gt;Grunberger 1971, p.425&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, 4000 of those works seized were "burned in the courtyard of the headquarters of the Berlin Fire-brigade."&lt;ref name="Grunberger.1971.p.425"/&gt;

The term ''Entartung'' (or "degeneracy") had gained popularity in Germany by the late 19th century when the critic and author [[Max Nordau]] devised the theory presented in his 1892 book, ''Entartung''.&lt;ref&gt;Barron 1991, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Nordau drew upon the writings of the [[criminology|criminologist]] [[Cesare Lombroso]], whose ''The Criminal Man'', published in 1876, attempted to prove that there were "born criminals" whose [[atavism|atavistic]] personality traits could be detected by scientifically measuring abnormal physical characteristics. Nordau developed from this premise a critique of [[modern art]], explained as the work of those so corrupted and enfeebled by modern life that they have lost the self-control needed to produce coherent works. Explaining the [[painterly|painterliness]] of [[Impressionism]] as the sign of a diseased visual cortex, he decried modern degeneracy while praising traditional German culture. Despite the fact that Nordau was Jewish (as was Lombroso), his theory of artistic degeneracy would be seized upon by German National Socialists during the [[Weimar Republic]] as a rallying point for their anti-Semitic and racist demand for [[Aryan race|Aryan]] purity in art.

Germany lost "thousands of intellectuals, artists, and academics, including many luminaries of Weimar culture and science", according to Raffael Scheck.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, Raffael.(2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Fischer says that "as soon as Hitler seized power, many intellectuals rushed to the exits."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p. 364&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proscribed literature===
According to Pauley, "literature was the first branch of the arts to be affected by the Nazis."&lt;ref name="Pauley_109"&gt;Pauley, p.109&lt;/ref&gt; "As early as April 1933, the Nazis had compiled a long blacklist of ''left'', democratic, and Jewish authors which included several famous authors of the nineteenth century."&lt;ref name="Pauley_109"/&gt; Large scale [[book burning]]s were staged across Germany in May 1933. Two thousand five hundred writers, including Nobel prize winners and writers of worldwide best sellers, left the country voluntarily or under duress, and were replaced by people without international reputations."&lt;ref name="Pauley_109"/&gt;

In June, 1933 the ''Reichsstelle zur Forderung des deutschen Schrifttums'' (Reich Office for the Promotion of German Literature) was established.&lt;ref name="Barbian 2010, pp. 27-28"/&gt; Jan-Pieter Barbian says, "On the level of the state, the Reich Ministry of Popular Enlightenment and Propaganda and the Reich Chamber of Literature had to share responsibility for literary policy with the new Reich Ministry of Science, Education, and Public Instruction and the Foreign Office."&lt;ref name="Barbian_9"/&gt; "The full repertoire—which also included the consistent removal of Jews and political opponents—was brought to bear during the twelve years of Nazi rule: on writers and publishers; book wholesaling; the retail, door-to-door, and mail-order book libraries, public libraries, and research libraries."&lt;ref name="Barbian_9"&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Between November 1933 and January 1934 publishers were informed "that supplying and distributing the works named is undesirable for national and cultural reasons and must therefore cease."&lt;ref&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers, who often faced enormous economic losses when books were banned, received letters stating that the "authorities responsible would proceed against any indiscretion in the most rigorous manner".&lt;ref name="Barbian_30"&gt;Barbian 2010, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Companies which had published primarily "the fiction of [[naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], [[expressionism]], [[Dadaism]], and [[New Objectivity]]; modern translated literature; and critical nonfiction ... suffered enormous economic losses."&lt;ref name="Barbian_30"/&gt; A few of the hardest hit publishers were Deutsche Verlags-Anstalt, S.Fischer Verlag, Gustav Kiepenheuer Verlags-AG, Rowohlt, Ullstein Verlags-AG, and Kurt Wolff Verlags.&lt;ref name="Barbian_30"/&gt; In 1935, the same year that "[[Goebbels]] assumed complete control over censorship," the Reichsschrifttumskammer banned the work of 524 authors.&lt;ref name="Baez 2004, p. 211"/&gt; "The Office for the Supervision of Ideological Training and Education of the NSDAP...became another watchdog of the state, spying on writers, developing black lists, encouraging book burnings, and emptying museums of 'non-German' works of art."&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.365&lt;/ref&gt; Punishments varied, some individuals were censored or had their work destroyed or publicly ridiculed, while others were incarcerated in concentration camps.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p. 366&lt;/ref&gt;

"During World War II, 1939–1945, identical indexes of forbidden literature were applied by the Nazis in all occupied countries as well as in Germany's allied countries: Denmark, Norway, France, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Belarus, Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, and of course, Germany."&lt;ref&gt;Karolides 2011, p.152&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book burnings===
{{main|Nazi book burnings}}
[[File:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|right|upright|thumb|In 1933, Nazis burned works of Jewish authors, and other works considered "un-German", at the library of the Institut für Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin.]]
Described as a cleaning action or ''Sauberung'',&lt;ref&gt;Fischer 1997, p.366&lt;/ref&gt; [[book burnings]], known as the ''Bücherverbrennung'' in Germany, and sometimes referred to as the "[[bibliocaust]]", began on May 10, 1933, when the Association of German Students confiscated some 25,000 books from the [[Institute for Sexual Research]] and several captured Jewish libraries, which were burned in [[Opernplatz (Berlin)|Opernplatz]].&lt;ref name="Baez_209-210"&gt;Baez 2011, pp. 209-210&lt;/ref&gt; Like a lit fuse, the bonfire triggered book burning in other cities all over Germany, including Frankfurt and Munich, where the burnings were part of an orchestrated program, including music and speeches.&lt;ref name="Baez_209-210"/&gt; "Political police groups like the SA, the SS, and the Gestapo unleashed a campaign of intimidation that often frightened people into burning their own books."&lt;ref&gt;Baez 2011, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

"The blind writer [[Helen Keller]] published an ''Open Letter to German Students:'' 'You may burn my books and the books of the best minds in Europe, but the ideas those books contain have passed through millions of channels and will go on.'"&lt;ref&gt;Baez 2011, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degenerate Art exhibition===
Modern artworks were purged from German museums. Over 5,000 works were initially seized, including 1,052 by [[Emil Nolde|Nolde]], 759 by [[Erich Heckel|Heckel]], 639 by [[Ernst Ludwig Kirchner]] and 508 by [[Max Beckmann]], as well as smaller numbers of works by such artists as [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[James Ensor]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam 1992, pp. 121–122&lt;/ref&gt; These became the material for a defamatory exhibit, ''[[Degenerate Art Exhibition|Entartete Kunst]]'' ("Degenerate Art"), featuring over 650 paintings, sculptures, prints, and books from the collections of thirty two German museums, that premiered in [[Munich]] on July 19, 1937, and remained on view until November 30 before travelling to eleven other cities in Germany and Austria. In this exhibition, the artworks were deliberately presented in a disorderly manner, and accompanied by mocking labels. "To 'protect' them, children were not allowed in."&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas 1995, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

Coinciding with the ''Entartete Kunst'' exhibition, the ''[[:de:Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung|Große Deutsche Kunstausstellung]]'' (Great German art exhibition) made its premiere amid much pageantry. This exhibition, held at the palatial ''[[Haus der Kunst|Haus der deutschen Kunst]]'' (House of German Art), displayed the work of officially approved artists such as [[Arno Breker]] and [[Adolf Wissel]]. At the end of four months ''Entartete Kunst'' had attracted over two million visitors, nearly three and a half times the number that visited the nearby ''Grosse deutsche Kunstausstellung''.&lt;ref name="Adam 1992, pp. 124-125"/&gt;

The Degenerate Art Exhibition included works by some of the great international names—[[Paul Klee]], [[Oskar Kokoschka]] and [[Wassily Kandinsky]]—along with famous German artists of the time such [[Max Beckmann]], [[Emil Nolde]], and [[Georg Grosz]]. The exhibition handbook explained that the aim of the show was to "reveal the philosophical, political, racial and moral goals and intentions behind this movement, and the driving forces of corruption which follow them". Works were included "if they were abstract or expressionistic, but also in certain cases if the work was by a Jewish artist", says [[Jonathan Petropoulos]], professor of European History at [[Claremont McKenna College]] and author of several books on art and politics in the Third Reich. Hitler had been an artist before he was a politician—but the realistic paintings of buildings and landscapes that he preferred had been dismissed by the art establishment in favor of abstract and modern styles. So the Degenerate Art Exhibition was his moment to get his revenge. He had made a speech about it that summer, saying "works of art which cannot be understood in themselves but need some pretentious instruction book to justify their existence will never again find their way to the German people". The Nazis claimed that degenerate art was the product of Jews and [[Bolsheviks]], although only six of the 112 artists featured in the exhibition were actually Jewish. The art was divided into different rooms by category—art that was blasphemous, art by Jewish or communist artists, art that criticized German soldiers, art that offended the honor of German women. One room featured entirely abstract paintings, and was labelled "the insanity room". The idea of the exhibition was not just to mock modern art, but to encourage the viewers to see it as a symptom of an evil plot against the German people. The curators went to some lengths to get the message across, hiring actors to mingle with the crowds and criticize the exhibits. The Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich attracted more than a million visitors—three times more than the officially sanctioned Great German Art Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24819441|title=Why Hitler put 'degenerate' art on show|first=Lucy|last=Burns|date=6 November 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of the more common configuration of 2x2 or 3x3, artistic video walls allow users to display a single image, video or display canvas across displays arranged ad hoc and at different angles. This allows users to design unusual configurations: EX. layouts that attract attention, or serve as a unique artistic feature in a public space.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/articles/the-digital-signage-evolution-of-techorating |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101015337/http://www.digitalsignagetoday.com/articles/the-digital-signage-evolution-of-techorating/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-11-01 |title=The Digital Signage Evolution of 'Techorating' |accessdate=2015-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Source rotation ==

The simplest approach to a 'unique' video wall is to rotate the source content which allows end users to rotate the actual displays.  By using a mix of portrait and landscape displays this allows users to deploy a video wall that is not a simple matrix, however this approach is limited to keeping all displays at the same angle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.avinteractive.com/features/buyers-guide/tech-briefing-lef-videowalls-06-05-2014/ |title=Tech Briefing: LFD and Videowalls |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Any angle rotation ==

Any angle rotation allows individual displays to rotate to any angle allowing greater flexibility in the video wall lay out. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.avinteractive.com/features/buyers-guide/tech-briefing-lef-videowalls-06-05-2014/ |title=Tech Briefing: LFD and Videowalls |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Mix of display types and sizes ==

An additional feature of some video walls is the ability to mix display sizes and types.  Instead of requiring a set of uniform displays, users can mix and match displays of different sizes and aspect ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.avinteractive.com/features/buyers-guide/tech-briefing-lef-videowalls-06-05-2014/ |title=Tech Briefing: LFD and Videowalls |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Artistry of the Mentally Ill: a contribution to the psychology and psychopathology of configuration''''' ({{lang-de|Bildnerei der Geisteskranken: ein Beitrag zur Psychologie und Psychopathologie der Gestaltung}}) is a 1922 book by [[psychiatrist]] [[Hans Prinzhorn]], known as the work that launched the field of [[outsider art|psychiatric art]]. It was the first attempt to analyze the drawings of the mentally ill not merely psychologically, but also [[aesthetic]]ally.

In the book, Prinzhorn presents the works of ten "[[schizophrenic]] masters", now housed in Prinzhorn Collection at the [[University Hospital Heidelberg]], with in-depth aesthetic analysis of each and also full-color reproductions of their work. These ten masters were (birth names in parentheses):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.klinikum.uni-heidelberg.de/fileadmin/pressestelle/pressemappen/Kuenstlerliste.pdf Kuenstlerliste]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barratt Due Institute of Music''' (initiated 1927 in [[Oslo]], Norway) is a music education institute founded by the pianist [[Mary Barratt Due]] and the violinist [[Henrik Adam Due]]. It is a private [[stiftelse|foundation]] which receives government funding for parts of its activities. Located at [[Fagerborg]] in Oslo the institute offers [[music education]] from [[infant]] age through college levels.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://snl.no/Barratt_Due_Musikkinstitutt |title=Barratt Due Musikkinstitutt |work=Biography |publisher=[[Store Norske Leksikon]] |date=2013-01-07 |accessdate=2015-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute's motto is "From music kindergarten to concert podium" and the students are educated through college level degrees and onto the professional arena. Due to this model Barratt Due has through three generations been an important institution in Norwegian music life. [[Stephan Barratt-Due]] is the school's artistic director and also leads the Institute's ensemble-in-residence, [[Oslo Camerata]].

'''Colchester Art Society''' was founded in 1946 by a group of artists who lived in [[Colchester]] and the nearby areas, many of whom were also linked to the Colchester School of Art, which is part of [[Colchester Institute]]. The aim of the society was and still is the promotion of the visual arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk/colchesterartsocietyaboutus.html|title=Colchester Art Society |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==

In 1946, a period of renewed optimism after the [[Second World War]], a group of young artists eager to exhibit together founded the Colchester Art Society. Some of its founding members were [[Roderic Barrett]], [[Edward Bawden]], [[Henry and Joyce Collins|Henry Collins]], Reg Hazel, [[Cedric Morris]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Henry and Joyce Collins|Joyce Pallot]], [[Rowland Suddaby]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Artists in Britain since 1945|author=David Buckman|year=2006|publisher=Art Dictionaries Ltd|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sylvia St. George.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artbiogs.co.uk/2/societies/colchester-art-society |title=Colchester Art Society |publisher=Artists Biographies |accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Creating an Art Community|author=Peter Wakelin|year=1999|publisher=Aztec Press|isbn=0 72 00 04721|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Colchester Art Society was founded following a meeting of local artists called by Reg Hazell who at the time was the head of the Colchester School of Arts. The initial meeting was attended by Henry Collins, Roderic Barrett and the children's illustrator Jenny Ward. Following this initial meeting [[Cedric Morris]] and [[Arthur Lett-Haines]] who ran the [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]] joined the group alongside Joyce Pallot, Sylvia St George and others. The painter John Nash [[Royal Academician|RA]] was invited to be the Society's first president and remained president until his death in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, V. 2008 '' Colchester Institute: Selected works from the Colchester Art Society Collection'' Exhibition Catalogue, The Minories&lt;/ref&gt; Other presidents of the Society have included Cedric Morris, Roderic Barrett and Anthony Atkinson. Cedric Morris was a key figure who encouraged the activities of the Colchester Art Society.&lt;ref&gt;R. Blythe, ''Sir Cedric Morris'', Exhibition Catalogue, The Minories, 13 Sept-19 Oct 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

The first exhibition of the group showed 37 artists and took place in [[Colchester Castle]]. The selection committee decided that the criteria to choose the works would be based purely on merit, regardless of the background, experience or popularity of the artist. This policy remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk |title=Colchester Art Society |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artist and designer Henry Collins designed the posters for the exhibition alongside the society's logo, which is still used today.&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, V. 2008 '' Colchester Institute: Selected works from the Colchester Art Society Collection'' Exhibition Catalogue, The Minories&lt;/ref&gt;

At Colchester Art Society's Autumn Exhibition which was held at Colchester Castle in October 1948, Cedric Morris exhibited a portrait of his then-student, [[Lucian Freud]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/profile-lucian-freud-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-happy-man-1191260.html|title=Profile: Lucian Freud: Portrait of the artist as a happy man|accessdate=2 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now part of the Tate's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Tate Gallery 1980-82: Illustrated Catalogue of Acquisitions|year=1984|publisher=Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent Collection==

Since the early years of the foundation of the Colchester Art Society the President, the Chairman of Selectors, and the members of the Panel select works from the exhibitions in order to purchase them and keep them as part of their Permanent Collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk |title=The Permanent Collection |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Permanent Collection includes a number of works produced by renowned East Anglian artists from the past half century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk |title=The Permanent Collection |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including: [[Roderic Barrett]], [[Arthur Lett-Haines]], Lucy Harwood (who also belonged to the [[East Anglian School of Painting and Drawing]]), [[Blair Hughes-Stanton]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]] (who was the first president of the Colchester Art Society), [[Cedric Morris]], [[Bernard Reynolds]] and Valerie Thornton. Nash bequeathed his personal library and some of his paintings and engravings to [[The Minories, Colchester]], who later sold most of the material to the [[Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vbltcollection.org.uk/vbltdetail.asp?record=177a_04 |title=Biography |publisher=The Victor Batte-Lay Trust Collection |accessdate=2014-07-31 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theminories.co.uk/History.htm |title=What about its history? |publisher=The Friends of the Minories Art Gallery |date= |accessdate=2014-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Colchester Art Society Today ==

The Colchester Art Society provides its members the opportunity to exhibit artworks, to have informal debates and discussion, as well as to access relevant information and support. The group welcomes various art forms, such as painting, sculpture, textiles, ceramics, and works on paper, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colchesterartsociety.co.uk |title=Colchester Art Society |publisher=Colchester Art Society |accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Hammons''' (born 1943) is an American artist especially known for his works in and around [[New York City]] and [[Los Angeles]] during the 1970s and 1980s.

==Early life==

David Hammons was born in 1943 in [[Springfield, Illinois]], the youngest of ten children of a single mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schjeldahl|first=Peter|title=The Walker|journal=The New Yorker|date=December 23, 2002|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2002/12/23/021223craw_artworld|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1962 he moved to Los Angeles, where he started attending Chouinard Art Institute (now [[CalArts]]) from 1966 to 1968 and the [[Otis Art Institute]] from 1968 to 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Hammons - Biography|url=http://www.lmgallery.com/artists/david-hammons/?view=bio|publisher=L&amp;M Arts|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There he was influenced by internationally known artists such as [[Bruce Nauman]], [[John Baldessari]], and [[Chris Burden]], but was also part of a pioneering group of [[African-American]] artists and jazz musicians in Los Angeles, with influence outside the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles 1960–1980|url=http://www.momaps1.org/exhibitions/view/352|publisher=Museum of Modern Art|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974 Hammons settled in New York City, where he slowly became better known nationally. He still lives and works in New York.

==Art practice==
Much of his work reflects his commitment to the civil rights and [[Black Power]] movements. A good example is the early ''Spade with Chains'' (1973), where the artist employs a provocative, derogatory term, coupled with the literal [[spade|gardening instrument]], in order to make a visual pun between the blade of a shovel and an African mask, and a contemporary statement about the issues of bondage and resistance. This was part of a larger series of "Spade" works in the 1970s, including ''Bird'' (1973), where [[Charlie Parker]] is evoked by a spade emerging from a saxophone, and ''Spade'', a 1974 print where the artist pressed his face against the shape leaving a caricature-like imprint of Negroid features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Coco|author2=Christian Haye|title=Wreaking Havoc on the Signified|journal=Frieze|date=May 22, 1985|issue=22|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/wreaking_havoc_on_the_signified/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, Hammons took part in [[Colab]]'s ground-breaking ''The Times Square Show'', which acted as a forum for exchange of ideas for a younger set of alternative artists in New York. His installation was made of glistening scattered shards of glass (from broken bottles of Night Train wine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahern|first=Charles|title=The Times Square Show revisited|url=http://timessquareshowrevisited.com/accounts/charlie-ahearn.html|work=(as told to Shawna Cooper, August 8, 2011)|publisher=Hunter College Gallery, CUNY|accessdate=October 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works play on the association of basketball and young black men, such as drawings made by repeatedly bouncing a dirty basketball on huge sheets of clean white paper set on the floor; a series of larger-than-life basketball hoops, meticulously decorated with bottle caps, evoking Islamic mosaic and design; and ''Higher Goals'' (1986), where an ordinary basketball hoop, net, and backboard are set on a three-story high pole - commenting on the almost impossible aspirations of sports stardom as a way out of the ghetto.

Through his varied work and media, and frequent changes in direction, Hammons has managed to avoid one signature visual style. Much of his work makes allusions to, and shares concerns with minimalism and post-minimal art, but with added Duchampian references to the place of Black people in American society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fusco|first=Coco|author2=Christian Haye|title=Wreaking Havoc on the Signified|journal=Frieze|date=May 22, 1985|issue=22|url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/wreaking_havoc_on_the_signified/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[James Turrell]]'s works concerning perception of light, Hammons said "I wish I could make art like that, but we're too oppressed for me to be dabbling out there.... I would love to do that because that could also be very black. You know, as a black artist, dealing just with light. They would say, "how in the hell could he deal with that, coming from where he did?" I want to get to that, I'm trying to get to that, but I'm not free enough yet. I still feel I have to get my message out."&lt;ref&gt;Mcfadden, Jane. "Here, here, or there : on the whereabouts of art in the seventies." ''Pacific standard time : Los Angeles art 1945-1980''. Los Angeles: Getty Research Institute and the J. Paul Getty Museum, 2011. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with his focus on cultural overtones, Hammons’s work also discusses the notions of public and private spaces, as well as what constitutes a valuable commodity. An illustration of these concepts can be seen in ''Bliz-aard Ball Sale'' (1983), a performance piece in which Hammons situates himself alongside street vendors in downtown [[Manhattan]] in order to sell snowballs which are priced according to size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Can you remove the rainbow from happening?|url=http://www.inenart.eu/?p=13122|work=InEnArt|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act serves both as a parody on commodity exchange and a commentary on the capitalistic nature of art fostered by art galleries. Furthermore, it puts a satirical premium on "[[Whiteness studies|whiteness]]", ridiculing the superficial luxury of racial classification as well as critiquing the hard social realities of street vending experienced by those who have been discriminated against in terms of race or class.

Also noteworthy is the artist's use of discarded or [[Abject Art|abject]] materials, including but not limited to elephant dung, chicken parts, strands of African-American hair, and bottles of cheap wine. Many critics see these objects as evocative of the desperation of the poor, Black urban class, but Hammons reportedly saw a sort of sacrosanct or ritualistic power in these materials, which is why he utilized them so extensively.

Hammons explored the [[video]] medium, collaborating with artist [[Alex Harsley]] on a number of video works, including ''Phat Free'' (originally titled ''Kick the Bucket''), which was included in the [[Whitney Biennial]] and other venues. Hammons and Harsley have also collaborated on [[Installation art|installations]] at New York's 4th Street Photo Gallery, a noted East Village artist exhibition and project space.

In a show at L &amp; M Arts in uptown Manhattan (January 18–March 31, 2007, his first authorized New York show since 2002, although there have been unauthorized surveys), Hammons collaborated with Japanese artist Chie (Hasegawa) Hammons in a piece that enjoyed public acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;''The Brooklyn Rail'' (April 2007), "David and Chie Hammons," review by Jen Schwarting; ''The Village Voice'' (February 27, 2007), "Fur What It's Worth," by Jerry Saltz; among others.&lt;/ref&gt; In the posh uptown gallery specially selected by Hammons (who does not accept to be associated with any one gallery), they installed full-length fur coats on antique dress forms—two minks, a fox, a sable, a wolf and a chinchilla: "Hammons and his wife have also painted, burned, burnished, and stained the backs of all of these coats, turning them into aesthetic/ethical/sartorial traps.... Hammons has said that he wants 'to slide away from visuals and get deeper.' At L &amp; M, not only does Hammons do this; along the way he conjures thoughts of shamanism, politics, consumerism, animism, genre painting, animal rights, and jokes. Here, we're treated to a sensibility as barbed, serious, maybe fearsome, and as passionate as any in the art world."&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Saltz, "Fur What It's Worth", ''[[The Village Voice]]'', February 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections and awards==
Hammons’s ''African American Flag'' is a part of the permanent collection of New York’s [[Museum of Modern Art]]. He also has work in the permanent collections of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], New York; [[Fogg Art Museum]], Cambridge; [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in [[Washington DC]]; [[Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago]], Chicago; [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]]; [[Fondation Cartier pour l'art contemporain]], [[Paris]]; [[The Tate]], [[London]]; and other museums and collections.

Hammons received the [[MacArthur Fellowship]] (popularly known as the "Genius Grant") in July 1991.

'''Day Without Art''' ('''DWA''') is an annual event where art museums and other organizations organize programs to raise awareness of [[AIDS]], remember people who have died, and inspire positive action.

== History ==

Day Without Art began on December 1, 1989 as the national day of action and mourning in response to the AIDS crisis, which had rapidly and conspicuously decimated the artistic community. To make the public aware that [[AIDS]] can touch everyone, and inspire positive action, some 800 U.S. art and AIDS groups participated in the first Day Without Art, shutting down museums, sending staff to volunteer at AIDS services, or sponsoring special exhibitions of work about AIDS. Since then, Day With(out) Art has grown into a collaborative project in which an estimated 8,000 national and international museums, galleries, art centers, [[AIDS service organization]]s, libraries, high schools and colleges take part.

In the past, "Visual AIDS" initiated public actions and programs, published an annual poster and [[public domain|copyright-free]] [[Broadside (printing)|broadsides]], and acted as press coordinator and [[wikt:clearing house|clearing house]] for projects for Day Without Art/[[World AIDS Day]]. In 1997, it was suggested Day Without Art become a '''Day ''With'' Art''', to recognize and promote increased programming of cultural events that draw attention to the continuing [[pandemic]]. Though "the name was retained as a [[metaphor]] for the chilling possibility of a future day without art or artists", we added parentheses to the program title, '''Day With(out) Art''', to highlight the proactive programming of art projects by artists living with HIV/AIDS, and art about AIDS, that were taking place around the world. It had become clear that active interventions within the annual program were far more effective than actions to negate or reduce the programs of cultural centers. In 2014, the Los Angeles art collective, My Barbarian, staged a video performance in remembrance of [[Pedro Zamora]], inspired by the queer theorist, [[José Esteban Muñoz]]'s theory of counterpublicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.visualaids.org/blog/detail/tavia-nyongo#_edn3|title = The video is a remembrance within a remembrance: to Pedro Zamora and to José Esteban Muñoz.|last = AIDS|first = Visual|website = Visual AIDS|access-date = 2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==

The inaugural Day without Art exhibition held in [[New Zealand]] opened on 1 December 1995, at the [[Southland Museum and Art Gallery]].  Curated by Wayne P. Marriott, the installation was undertaken by Daniel McKnight, Vicky Byrne and Marriott.  In 1996 the Southland Museum and Art Gallery was awarded a New Zealand AIDS Foundation media award for its work in promoting a better understanding of the impact of HIV/AIDS on the wider community.  The museum continued to annually host a Day without Art exhibition until 1999.

There are two types of '''exhibition catalogue''' (or '''exhibition catalog'''): a printed list of exhibits at an [[Art exhibition|art]] exhibition; and a directory of exhibitors at a [[trade fair]] or business-to-business event.

==Art or museum exhibition catalogues==
Catalogues for art or museum exhibitions may range in scale from a single printed sheet to a lavish [[hardcover]] "[[coffee table book]]". The advent of cheap colour-[[printing]] in the 1960s transformed what had usually been simple "handlists" with several works to each page into large scale "descriptive catalogues" that are intended as both contributions to scholarship and books likely to appeal to many general readers.  The catalogues for exhibitions held at a museum are now often far more detailed than the catalogues of their permanent collections. 
  
In the early 21st century, exhibitions that gather items from other institutions (museums, galleries, libraries, etc.) and that are elaborately publicized very often have catalogues in the form of substantial books.

===Format of art catalogues===
Book-sized exhibition catalogues in the West typically have a colour photograph of every item on display, and also of other relevant works not in the exhibition (these usually smaller and often in black and white).  There will be a short formal catalogue description of each item, and usually interpretative text often amounting to one or more pages.  The resulting book will have at least one introductory essay, often several, footnotes, [[bibliography]] and other [[critical apparatus]].  It is usually only in the language of the location, although if the exhibition is travelling internationally, local translated editions will be produced for each location.  The book may be published by the institution that hosts the exhibition (or one of these institutions), but is distributed by and often co-published with a larger publisher.  It will not dwell on the fact that it is the catalogue of a particular exhibition, and often will not contain a plan of the exhibition.  Visitors to the exhibition will anyway know this, and the intention - often successful - is to create a book which has a permanent usefulness.  Nearly all are produced in [[paperback]]; a hardback edition is a sign of serious intentions.  Most major catalogues are sold in at least some bookshops, and are available for order more widely through the booktrade.  Many receive specific sponsorship to finance them, and usually a number of authors contribute.
[[File:Bibliotheca Zriniana (Croatia) - katalog.jpg|thumb|Front cover of the 2008 [[Čakovec]] exhibition catalogue of ''[[Bibliotheca Zriniana]]'' library from 1662, owned by [[Nikola Zrinski]], Ban (Viceroy) of Croatia]]

In recent decades, exhibition catalogues have grown to prodigious sizes and may be the most comprehensive sources for even rather large subject areas.  Probably the largest to be produced were in the 1970s in a competitive spree by Italian provinces and German [[States of Germany|lander]] to promote the significance of their region by mounting huge exhibitions on the period when its cultural production was at its peak.  A typical example is the three-volume ''Die ''Parler'' und der schöne Stil 1350-1400. Europäische Kunst unter den Luxemburgern'' from [[Cologne]] of 1978, with a further two volumes published in 1980 on a colloquium held in conjunction with the exhibition.  The three volumes covering the exhibition proper amount to over a thousand pages and it would have been unfeasible to have taken them into the exhibition itself.  Another example is ''The History of Japanese Photography,'' 432 pages long and with over four hundred plates.

This trend was led in Britain by the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and in the USA by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York and the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington.

===Japanese catalogues===
Japanese exhibition catalogues often provide captions, a certain amount of text, or both in a second language (usually English), and occasionally also a smaller amount in a third language. This is not always so: the large catalogue (over 360 pages) for a major exhibition of the [[Woodblock printing in Japan|wood-block]] artist [[Yasunori Taninaka]] is in Japanese alone. Meanwhile, ''Works by 25 Photographers in their 20s'' is completely bilingual, Japanese and English.

The great majority of Japanese exhibition catalogues are only available directly from the galleries or museums that host or hosted the exhibitions. These catalogues are acquired and shelved by libraries together with other books and are available on the used book market, but lack [[ISBN]]s. However, exceptions do exist: the catalogue of an exhibition of the photographs of [[Nakaji Yasui]] was produced via an independent publisher and distributed as a regular book.

==Catalogues for trade fairs==
Exhibition catalogues are used at commercial exhibitions and trade fairs to profile all the exhibitors at the event. They serve not only as a guide for visitors on the day, but also as an industry directory used afterwards by visitors (and others) to find suppliers and business partners.

Many exhibition catalogues are used by market researchers because they contain good quality information about companies that are active in a particular market place.

A typical exhibition catalogue contains the following: 
* Introduction and welcome message from the event organiser
* Floor plan showing the location of each exhibition stand
* Summary alphabetical list of exhibitors
* Exhibitor profiles (normally a textual description of each exhibitor plus their contact details)
* A ‘buyer’s guide’ where exhibitors are listed under relevant product or service categories
* Details of seminars or conference sessions running alongside the exhibition
* Advertisements promoting the exhibitors

The format of exhibition catalogues for trade fairs can range from A5-sized ‘saddle-stitched’ publications with descriptions of as few as 30-40 exhibitors, to much larger perfect-bound ‘stretched A5’ or A4-sized directories containing profiles on thousands of companies exhibiting at major international trade events such as The [[London Book Fair]], SIAL (the Paris-based food exhibition), and [[Nuremberg International Toy Fair]] (Spielwarenmesse).

The exhibition organiser is ultimately responsible for publishing the catalogue for their own event. However, many organisers outsource the design, production and advertising sales for these publications to specialist exhibition catalogue contract publishers operating within the exhibitions industry.

Other common terms to describe the exhibition catalogue at a trade fair include 'event guide', 'show guide', 'show catalogue', 'exhibition directory', 'fair guide' or 'exhibition guide'. Often exhibition organisers will add the word 'official' to the front of the name of the publication (e.g. 'Official exhibition catalogue') to distinguish their publication from unofficial exhibition catalogues for their event produced by trade magazine publishers.

[[Image:futakuchi-onna.jpg|thumb|250px|An image of a futakuchi-onna from the [[Ehon Hyaku Monogatari]]]]
A {{nihongo|'''futakuchi-onna'''|二口女||lit. "two-mouthed woman"}} is a type of [[yōkai]] or Japanese [[monster]].  They are characterized by their two [[mouth]]s – a normal one located on her face and second one on the back of the [[head]] beneath the [[hair]]. There, the woman's [[human skull|skull]] splits apart, forming lips, [[teeth]] and a [[tongue]], creating an entirely functional second mouth.

In [[Japanese mythology]] and [[kaidan|folklore]], the futakuchi-onna belongs to the same class of stories as the [[rokurokubi]], [[kuchisake-onna]] and the [[yama-uba]], women afflicted with a [[curse]] or [[supernatural]] [[disease]] that transforms them into yōkai.  The supernatural nature of the women in these stories is usually concealed until the last minute, when the true self is revealed.

==Origins of the second mouth==
The origin of a futakuchi-onna's second [[mouth]] is often linked to how little a woman eats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227233426/http://www.youkaimura.org/futaku.htm|title=Wayback Machine|date=27 February 2007|publisher=|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many stories, the soon-to-be futakuchi-onna is a wife of a [[miser]] and rarely eats. To counteract this, a second mouth mysteriously appears on the back of the woman's head. The second mouth often mumbles spiteful and threatening things to the woman and demands food. If it is not fed, it can screech obscenely and cause the woman tremendous pain. Eventually, the woman's hair begins to move like a pair of [[Snake|serpents]], allowing the mouth to help itself to the woman's meals. While no food passes through her normal lips, the mouth in the back of her head consumes twice what the other one would. In another story, the extra mouth is formed when a stingy woman is accidentally hit in the head by her husband's [[axe]] while he is chopping wood, and the wound never heals. Other stories have the woman as a mother who lets her stepchild die of [[starvation]] while keeping her own offspring well fed; presumably, the [[spirit]] of the neglected child lodges itself in the stepmother's or the surviving daughter's body to exact [[revenge]].

==Prototypical story==
This is the most famous and prototypical story of a futakuchi-onna:

In a small village there lived a stingy miser who, because he could not bear the expense of paying for food for a wife, lived entirely by himself.

One day he met a woman who did not eat anything, whom he immediately took for his wife. Because she never ate a thing, and was still a hard worker, the old miser was extraordinarily thrilled with her, but on the other hand he began to wonder why his stores of rice were steadily decreasing.

One day the man pretended to leave for work, but instead stayed behind to spy on his new wife. To his horror, he saw his wife’s hair part on the back of her head, her skull split wide revealing a gaping mouth. She unbound her hair, which reached out like tentacles to grasp the rice and shovel it into the hungry mouth.

==In popular culture==
{{Pop culture|date=April 2018}}
* In the manga ''[[Gantz]]'' a creature that has the characteristics of both the Futakuhi-onna and the [[Rokurokubi]] (i.e. second mouth on the back of the head and the ability to elongate the neck) is seen in later chapters of the series albeit briefly. It is not stated if this is another variation of the creature or a way to feature both at the same time.
* The long running anime series ''[[GeGeGe No Kitaro]]'' often features Futakuchi-onna as an antagonist to Kitaro. Her skin is a pale white with raven black hair which can form snake-like ropes that stretch out and snare victims, often to pull them towards her horrifically large mouth on the back of her head which has sharp teeth. She is also known to work with other [[Yōkai]] antagonists [[Kamaitachi]] and [[Tantanbō]].
* The 2005 movie ''[[The Great Yokai War]]'' briefly features a futakuchi-onna.
* In the [[video game]] ''[[The Last Blade]]'', the character [[List of The Last Blade characters#Akari Ichijou|Akari Ichijou]] uses various attacks that involve [[yōkai]]. One of them is a special move that summons "a hundred yōkai" that parade across the screen in a procession. A futakuchi-onna is featured in this procession.
* ''[[Samurai Sentai Shinkenger]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers Samurai]]'' villain [[Gedoushu|Tayu Usukawa]] is themed after the Futakuchi-onna.

'''Guy Louis Debord''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|ˈ|b|ɔr}}; {{IPA-fr|gi dəbɔʁ|lang}}; 28 December 1931 – 30 November 1994) was a French [[Marxist]] theorist, philosopher, [[filmmaker]], member of the [[Letterist International]], founder of a Letterist faction, and founding member of the [[Situationist International]] (SI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/14/Dead_Bored_Debords_Dead|title=Dead Bored: Debord's Dead!  Andrew Hussey on the death of a turbulent thinker|last=|first=|date=|website=Philosophynow.org|publisher=|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also briefly a member of ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]''.

==Early life==
Guy Debord (also known as "Debord Guy") was born in [[Paris, France|Paris]] in 1931. Debord's father, Martial, was a pharmacist who died due to illness when Debord was young. Debord's mother, Paulette Rossi, sent Guy to live with his grandmother in her family villa in Italy. During World War II, the Rossis left the villa and began to travel from town to town. As a result, Debord attended high school in Cannes, where he began his interest in film and [[vandalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bourseiller, Christophe. "Vie et Mort de Guy Debord". Agora.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young man, Debord actively opposed the [[Algerian War|French war in Algeria]] and joined in demonstrations in Paris against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/guillaume.html|title=Pierre Guillaume Remembers Guy Debord|website=Notbored.org|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debord studied Law at the University of Paris, but left early and did not complete his university education. After ending his stint at the University of Paris, he began his career as a writer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guy Debord, Concept of the Spectacle|last=Jappe|first=A|publisher=Berkely, CA: University of California Press.|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involvement with the Letterists ==
Debord joined the [[Lettrism|Letterist International]] when he was 19. The Letterists were led dictatorially by [[Isidore Isou]] until a widely agreed upon schism ended Isou's authority. This schism gave rise to several factions of Letterists, one of which was decidedly led by Debord upon Gil Wolman's unequivocal recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;Bourseiller, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, Debord led the [[Situationist International]] group, which influenced the Paris Uprising of [[May 1968 in France|1968]], during which he took part in the occupation of the Sorbonne. Some consider his book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1967) to be a catalyst for the uprising,&lt;ref&gt;Andreotti, L. "Review: Leaving the twentieth century: The Situationist International." ''Journal of Architectural Education, 49''(3), p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; although perhaps a more immediately significant text was [[Mustapha Khayati]]'s "[[On the Poverty of Student Life]]", published in November 1966.

==Founding of the Situationist International==
In 1957, the Letterist International, the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]], and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] gathered in Cosio d'Arroscia (Cuneo), Italy, to found the Situationist International, with Debord having been the leading representative of the Letterist delegation. Initially made up of a number of well-known artists such as Asger Jorn and Pinot Gallizio, the early days of the SI were heavily focused on the formulation of a critique of art, which would serve as a foundation for the group's future entrance into further political critiques. The SI was known for a number of its interventions in the art world, which included one raid against an international art conference in Belgium during 1958&lt;ref&gt;Internationale Situationniste No. 1, June 1958, pages 29-30,&lt;/ref&gt; that included a large pamphlet drop and significant media coverage, all of which culminated in the arrest of various situationists and sympathizers associated with the scandal. In addition to this action, the SI endeavored to formulate industrial painting, or, painting prepared en masse with the intent of defaming the original value largely associated with the art of the period. In the course of these actions, Debord was heavily involved in the planning and logistical work associated with preparing these interventions, as well as the work for ''Internationale Situationniste'' associated with theoretical defense of the Situationist International's actions.&lt;ref&gt;Debord, Guy. ''Correspondence: The Founding of the Situationist International. ''Semiotext(e). 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political phase of the Situationist International==
In the early 1960s Debord began to direct the SI toward an end of its artistic phase, eventually expelling members such as Jorn, Gallizio, Troche, and Constant—the bulk of the "artistic" wing of the SI—by 1965. Having established the situationist critique of art as a social and political critique, one not to be carried out in traditional artistic activities, the SI began, due in part to Debord's contributions, to pursue a more concise theoretical critique of capitalist society along Marxist lines.

With Debord's 1967 work, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', and excerpts from the group's journal, ''Internationale Situationniste'', the Situationists began to formulate their theory of the spectacle, which explained the nature of late capitalism's historical decay. In Debord's terms, situationists defined the spectacle as an assemblage of social relations transmitted via the imagery of class power, and as a period of capitalist development wherein "all that was once lived has moved into representation".{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} With this theory, Debord and the SI would go on to play an influential role in the [[May 1968 events in France|revolts of May 1968 in France]], with many of the protesters drawing their slogans from Situationist tracts penned or influenced by Debord.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Situationist International==
[[File:In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni.JPG|thumb|left|Published by [[Éditions Gérard Lebovici]] (1990)]]
In 1972, Debord disbanded the Situationist International after its original members, including [[Asger Jorn]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]], quit or were expelled. (Vaneigem wrote a biting criticism of Debord and the International.&lt;ref&gt;"The Veritable Split in the SI", 1972&lt;/ref&gt;) Debord then focused on filmmaking with financial backing from the movie mogul and publisher, [[Gérard Lebovici]] (éditions [[Champ Libre]]), until Lebovici's mysterious death. Debord was suspected of Lebovici's murder. Distraught by the accusations and his friend's death, Debord took his films and writings out of production until after his death. He had agreed to have his films released posthumously at the request of the American researcher, [[Thomas Y. Levin]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy Debord, "Reflections of the Death of Gérard Lebovici"&lt;/ref&gt; Debord's two most recognized films are ''[[The Society of the Spectacle (film)|Society of the Spectacle]]'' (1973) and "{{Interlanguage link multi|In girum imus nocte et consumimur igni|fr}}" (1978).

After dissolving the Situationist International, Debord spent his time reading, and occasionally writing, in relative isolation in a cottage at Champot with Alice Becker-Ho, his second wife. He continued to correspond on political and other issues, notably with Lebovici and the Italian situationist [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notbored.org/debord.html|title=Guy Debord|website=Notbored.org|accessdate=27 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on reading material relating to war strategies, e.g. [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] and [[Sun Tzu]], and he designed a [[A Game of War|war game]] with [[Alice Becker-Ho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.fr/dp/2070776514 |title=Le Jeu de la Guerre: RelevÃ© des positions successives de toutes les forces au cours d'une partie - Guy Debord, Alice Becker-Ho - Livres |website=Amazon.fr |date= |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord married twice, first to [[Michèle Bernstein]] and then [[Alice Becker-Ho]]. Debord had affairs with other women, including [[Michèle Mochot-Bréhat]]. Bernstein wrote a vaguely fictional but detailed account of the open relationships Mochot and she had with Debord in her novel ''All The King's Horses''.

== Death ==
Just before Debord's death, he filmed (although did not publish) a documentary, "Son art et son temps" ("His Art and His Times"), an autobiography of sorts that focused primarily on social issues in Paris in the 1990s. It has been suggested that his dark depiction of this period was a suicide note of sorts. Both Debord's depression and alcohol consumption had become problematic, resulting in a form of [[neuritis|polyneuritis]]. Perhaps in order to end the suffering caused by these conditions, Debord committed suicide by shooting himself in the head (or possibly heart) on 30 November 1994. This was not the first time he attempted to end his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guy Debord and the Situationist International|last=McDonough|first=|publisher=|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord's suicide is as controversial as it is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Andrew Hussey |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/28/biography.artsandhumanities |title=The suicide of Guy Debord &amp;#124; Books |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date= |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some assert it was a revolutionary act related to his career. Due to his involvement with the radical [[Situationist International]] (SI), as well as his sadness at 'the society as a spectacle' being considered a cliché in later life, many think that Debord felt hopeless about the very society he was trying to shed light on. Debord was said to be "victim of the Spectacle he fought".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/25/biography.highereducation1|title=The Game of War: The Life and Death of Guy Debord|last=Baker|first=|date=August 2001|website=|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the many commentaries on Debord's demise, one scholar noted: "Guy Debord did not kill himself. He was murdered by the thoughtlessness and selfishness of so-called scholars (primarily trendy lit-criters) who colonized his brilliant ideas and transformed his radical politics into an academic status symbol not worth the pulp it's printed on…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://situationnisteblog.wordpress.com/2014/10/11/transgressions-a-journal-of-urban-exploration-1995-2001/ |title=Transgressions: A Journal of Urban Exploration [1995-2001&amp;#93; |website=Situationnisteblog.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
On 29 January 2009, fifteen years after his death, [[Christine Albanel]], [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Culture]], classified the archive of his works as a "[[national treasure]]" in response to a sale request by [[Yale University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-28060152.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=19 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002091839/http://juralibertaire.over-blog.com/article-28060152.html |archivedate=2 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2009/mar/18/guy-debord-situationist-international | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | title=The resurrection of Guy Debord | first=Andrew | last=Gallix | date=18 March 2009 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry declared that "he has been one of the most important contemporary thinkers, with a capital place in history of ideas from the second half of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Journal Officiel de la Republique Francaise du 12 fevrier 2009 (texte 120)&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Debord once called his book, ''The Society of the Spectacle'', "the most important book of the twentieth century".{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} He continues to be a canonical and controversial figure particularly among European scholars of radical politics and modern art.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Written works==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}
{{Left communism sidebar |expanded=People}}
Guy Debord's best known works are his theoretical books, ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and ''[[Comments on the Society of the Spectacle]]''. In addition to these he wrote a number of autobiographical books including ''Mémoires'', ''Panégyrique'', ''Cette Mauvaise Réputation...'', and ''Considérations sur l'assassinat de [[Gérard Lebovici]]''. He was also the author of numerous short pieces, sometimes anonymous, for the journals ''Potlatch'', ''Les Lèvres Nues'', ''Les Chats Sont Verts'', and ''Internationale Situationniste''. The [[The Society of the Spectacle|''Society of the spectacle'']] was written in an "interesting prose", unlike most writings in that time or of that nature. For Debord, the Spectacle is viewed as false representations in our real lives. The [[Spectacle (critical theory)|Spectacle]] is a materialized worldview. The spectacle 'subjects human beings to itself'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Society of the Spectacle|last=Debord|first=Guy|publisher=Canberra : Hobgoblin Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord was deeply distressed by the [[Cultural hegemony|hegemony]] of governments and media over everyday life through mass production and consumption. He criticized both the [[capitalism]] of the West and the dictatorial [[communism]] of the Eastern bloc for the lack of autonomy allowed to individuals by both types of governmental structure. Debord postulated that [[Marx's theory of alienation|Alienation]] had gained a new relevance through the invasive forces of the '[[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]]' - "a social relation between people that is mediated by images" consisting of [[mass media]], [[Advertising|advertisement]], and [[popular culture]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The spectacle is a self-fulfilling control mechanism for society. Debord's analysis developed the notions of "[[reification (Marxism)|reification]]" and [[commodity fetishism|"fetishism of the commodity"]] pioneered by [[Karl Marx]] and [[Georg Lukács]]. [[Semiotics of culture|Semiotics]] was also a major influence, particularly the work of his contemporary, Roland Barthes, who was the first to envisage bourgeois society as a spectacle, and to study in detail the political function of fashion within that spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Sollers "L'antifascisme de Barthes", Le Monde // Hors-Série Roland Barthes, Juillet-Août, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Debord's analysis of "the spectaclist society" probed the historical, economic, and psychological roots of the media and popular culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Central to this school of thought was the claim that alienation is more than an emotive description or an aspect of individual psychology: rather, it is a consequence of the mercantile form of social organization that has reached its climax in capitalism, as theorized by [[Herbert Marcuse]] of the [[Frankfurt School]]. 
{{Libertarian socialism |expanded=People}}
The Situationist International (SI), a political/artistic movement organized by Debord and his colleagues and represented by a journal of the same name, attempted to create a series of strategies for engaging in class struggle by reclaiming individual autonomy from the spectacle. These strategies, including "[[dérive]]" and "[[détournement]]," drew on the traditions of [[Lettrism]]. As founder of the SI, it has been suggested that Debord felt driven to generalize and define the values, ideas, and characteristics of the entire group, which may have contributed to his hand-picking and expulsion of members. The hierarchical and dictatorial nature of the SI existed, however, in the groups that birthed it, including the Letterists and the Surrealists.

Debord's first book, ''[[Mémoires]]'', was bound with a [[sandpaper]] cover so that it would damage other books placed next to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newshelton.com/wet/dry/?p=10356 |title=the new shelton wet/dry |website=Newshelton.com |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=14 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Debord has been the subject of numerous biographies, works of fiction, artworks, and songs, many of which are catalogued in the bibliography by Shigenobu Gonzalves, "Guy Debord ou la Beauté du Negatif."

Often, it is suggested that Debord was opposed to the creation of art, however, Debord writes in the Situationist International magazine ("Contre le Cinema") that he believes that "ordinary" (quotidian) people should make "everyday" (quotidian) art; art and creation should liberate from the [[Spectacle (critical theory)|spectacle]], from capitalism, and from the banality of everyday life in contemporary society. In "The Society of the Spectacle," Debord argues that it is the price put on art that destroys the integrity of the art object, not the material or the creation itself. It is important to note that Debord does not equate art to "the spectacle."

==Films==

Debord began an interest in film early in his life when he lived in Cannes in the late 1940s. Debord recounted that, during his youth, he was allowed to do very little other than attend films. He said that he frequently would leave in the middle of a film screening to go home because films often bored him. Debord joined the Lettrists just as [[Isidore Isou]] was producing films and the Lettrists attempted to sabotage [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s trip to Paris through negative criticism.

Overall, Debord challenged the conventions of filmmaking; prompting his audience to interact with the medium instead of being passive receivers of information. As a matter of fact, his film ''Hurlements'' exclusively consists of a series of black and white screens and silence with a bit of commentary dispersed throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Howls for Guy Debord|journal=Film Quarterly|volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Debord directed his first film, ''[[Hurlements en faveur de Sade]]'' in 1952 with the voices of Michèle Bernstein and Gil Wolman. The film has no images represented; instead, it shows bright white when there is speaking and black when there is not. Long silences separate speaking parts. The film ends with 24 minutes of black silence. People were reported to have become angry and left screenings of this film. The script is composed of quotes appropriated from various sources and made into a montage with a sort of non-linear narrative.

Later, through the financial support of Michèle Bernstein and Asger Jorn, Debord produced a second film, ''Sur le passage de quelques personnes à travers une assez courte unité de temps'', which combined scenes with his friends and scenes from mass media culture. This integration of Debord's world with mass media culture became a running motif climaxing with "The Society of the Spectacle". Debord wrote the book ''The Society of the Spectacle'' before writing the movie. When asked why he made the book into a movie, Debord said, "I don't understand why this surprised people. The book was already written like a script". Debord's last film, "Son Art et Son Temps", was not produced during his lifetime. It worked as a final statement where Debord recounted his works and a cultural documentary of "his time".

'''Hypocatastasis''' is a [[figure of speech]] that declares or implies a [[wikt:resemblance|resemblance]], representation or comparison. It differs from a [[metaphor]], because in a metaphor the two nouns are both named and given; while, in hypocatastasis, only one is named and the other is implied, or as it were, is put down underneath out of sight. Hence hypocatastasis is an implied resemblance or representation: that is an implied simile or metaphor. A hypocatastasis has more force than a metaphor or simile, and expresses as it were a superlative degree of resemblance.

Attribution for the creation of the term is given derisively to a Mr. Lord by G. Bush in 1850.  The latter accuses the former of inventing this category of Biblical comparisons which do not seem to fit into the standard categories of metaphor or [[simile]].&lt;ref name="Bush1850"&gt;{{cite journal|author=George Bush|journal=Anglo-American New Church Repository and Monthly Review: 1851-Feb., 1854|title=The Letter and the Spirit, No. XI|volume=III|issue=4|date=April 1850|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdgRAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA157|publisher=John Allen|pages=157–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then the term has mostly been confined to analysis of Biblical rhetoric, and it has never migrated to general public usage.  It does not appear in the 2009 version of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].

Bush says of Lord's term:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Hypocatastasis is the substitution, without a formal notice, of agents and objects of one sphere, or of one species, in the place of the persons or objects of another, as in [[Book of Isaiah|Is.]] iii. 15, "What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the faces of the poor?"  These acts, says Mr. L., are not literally impracticable, and therefore are not used metaphorically.  They are violent and extraordinary, and are employed by ''substitution'',  to signify analogous acts of extreme oppression and tyranny.&lt;ref name=Bush1850/&gt;  [Italics in original]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bullinger gives the following example: one may say to another, “You are ''like'' a beast.”&lt;ref&gt;Ethelbert William Bullinger, Figures of Speech Used in the Bible (London; New York: Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode; E. &amp; J. B. Young &amp; Co., 1898), 744.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be simile, tamely stating a fact. If, however, he said, “You ''are'' a beast” that would be metaphor. But, if he said simply, “'''Beast!'''” that would be hypocatastasis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Companion Bible: The Authorized Version of 1611 with the Structures and Critical, Explanatory, and Suggestive Notes and with 198 Appendixes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wiKjA4sqF_0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA25|accessdate=26 September 2013|date=1 August 1994|publisher=Kregel Publications|isbn=978-0-8254-2177-8|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the other part of the simile or metaphor (“you”), would be implied and not stated.  This figure, therefore, is calculated to arouse the mind and attract and excite the attention to the greatest extent.

An '''illustrator''' is an [[artist]] who specializes in enhancing [[writing]] or elucidating concepts by providing a visual representation that corresponds to the content of the associated text or idea. The [[illustration]] may be intended to clarify complicated concepts or objects that are difficult to describe textually, which is the reason illustrations are often found in children's books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Elster|first=Charles | last2=Simons | first2=Herbert |periodical=The Reading Teacher |volume=39 |issue=2 |year=1985 |title=How important are illustrations in children's readers? |publisher=International Reading Association |pages=148–152 |jstor=20199036 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustration is the art of making images that work with something and add to it without needing direct attention and without distracting from what they illustrate. The other thing is the focus of the attention, and the illustration's role is to add personality and character without competing with that other thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/6787/what-does-it-mean-to-be-an-illustrator|title=What does it mean to be an illustrator?|website=graphicdesign.stackexchange.com|access-date=2016-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrations have been used in [[advertisement]]s, [[architectural rendering]], [[greeting card]]s, [[poster]]s, [[book]]s, [[graphic novels]], [[storyboards]], [[User guide|manual]]s, [[business]], [[magazine]]s, [[shirts]], [[video games]], [[tutorials]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comet.ucar.edu/presentations/illustra/illustrations/illustrations_new.htm|title=Part One: The Instructional Role of Illustrations|work=ucar.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[newspapers]]. A [[cartoon|cartoon illustration]] can add humor to stories or essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islandcartoons.com/the-first-recorded-cartoon-illustration-and-animation/|title=The first recorded cartoon illustration and animation|work=Island Cartoons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use reference images to create scenes and characters. This can be as simple as looking at an image to inspire your artwork, or creating character sketches and detailed scenes from different angles to create the basis of a picture book world. Some traditional illustration techniques include [[watercolor]], [[pen and ink]], [[airbrush]] art, [[oil painting]], [[pastel]]s, [[wood engraving]], and [[Linocut|linoleum cuts]]. 

[[John Held, Jr.]] was an illustrator who worked in a variety of styles and media, including linoleum cuts, pen and ink drawings, magazine cover paintings, cartoons, [[comic strip]]s, and set design, while also creating fine art with his animal sculptures and watercolor, many established illustrators attended an art school or college of some sort and were trained in different painting and drawing techniques.

Traditional illustration seems to have made a resurgence in the age of social media thanks to social networks like Instagram, Facebook, Pinterest, and YouTube.{{cn|date=September 2018}} Currently traditional and digital illustration are both flourishing.

Universities and art schools offer specific courses in illustration (for example in the UK, a BA (Hons) [[academic degree|Degree]]) so this has become a new avenue into the profession. Many illustrators are [[freelance]], commissioned by publishers (of newspapers, books, or magazines) or advertising agencies. Most [[scientific visualization|scientific illustration]]s and [[technical illustration]]s are also known as [[information graphics]]. Among the information graphics specialists are medical illustrators who illustrate human anatomy, often requiring many years of artistic and medical training.

A particularly popular medium with illustrators of the 1950s and 1960s was [[Casein paint|casein]], as was egg [[tempera]]. The immediacy and durability of these media suited illustration's demands well. The artwork in both types of paint withstood the rigors of travel to clients and printers without damage.

Computer illustration, or digital illustration, is the use of digital tools to produce images under the direct manipulation of the artist, usually through a pointing device, such as a tablet or a mouse.

Computers dramatically changed the industry and today, many cartoonists and illustrators create [[digital illustration]]s using computers, [[graphics tablet]]s, and [[image scanner|scanners]]. Software such as [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]], Corel Painter, and Affinity Designer are now widely used by those professionals.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}

'''Jewish views on evolution''' includes a continuum of views about the [[theory of evolution]], [[experimental evolution]], the [[origin of life]], [[age of the universe]], [[evolutionary creationism]], and  [[theistic evolution]]. Today, many Jews accept the theory of evolution and do not see it as incompatible with traditional Judaism, reflecting the emphasis of prominent rabbis such as the [[Vilna Gaon]]&lt;ref&gt;The Vilna Gaon, [[Elijah ben Shlomo Zalman Kremer]], studied secular sciences and adwised his friends and students to do as well, maintaining that Judaism could only gain by studying them. {{cite web|title=ELIJAH BEN SOLOMON (also called Elijah Wilna, Elijah Gaon, and Der Wilner Gaon)|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/5673-elijah-ben-solomon|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Vilna Gaon contributed to secular sciences: ''Ayil Meshullash'', a treatise on trigonometry, geometry, and some principles of astronomy and algebra containing 400 rules, Wilna, 1834; ''Treatise on astronomy''; ''Treatises on the teḳufot and moladot"; ''Diḳduḳ Eliyahu'', a short Hebrew grammar, Wilna 1833; ''Ma'aseh Toreh'', a collection of notes on different subjects; ibd.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Maimonides]]&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides, Moses ben Maimon (RaMBaM) frequently cited principles of sciences, such as mathematics and physics, astronomy and medicine, and contributed to them. Maimonides held that there is no contradiction between the revealed truths of God and the truths discovered and explored by the human [[mind]], a gift from God. {{cite web|title=MOSES BEN MAIMON (RaMBaM; usually called MAIMONIDES)|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/11124-moses-ben-maimon|website=jewishencyclopedia.com|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the ethical rather than factual significance of scripture.

==Classical rabbinic teachings==
Many [[rabbi]]s believe that God completed the creation of the world close to 6,000 years ago. This view is based on a chronology developed in a [[midrash]], ''[[Seder Olam Rabbah|Seder Olam]]'', which was based on a literal reading of the [[Book of Genesis]]. It is attributed to the [[Tannaim|Tanna]] [[Yose ben Halafta]], and covers history from the creation of the universe to the construction of the Second [[Temple in Jerusalem]]. Since there is no explicit discussion in the classical era, it is commonly presumed that they took Genesis 1 literally, making the beginning of the world six days earlier, but this is presumption in the absence of data.

Some modern rabbis&lt;ref&gt;See for example Slifkin, Nathan, ''The Challenge of Creation: Judaism's Encounter with Science,Cosmology, and Evolution,'' ZooTorah/Lambda Press, Brooklyn, 2010, section two, "Cosmology," pp. 157-190 for a discussion of these beliefs&lt;/ref&gt; believe that the world is older. They believe such a view is needed to accept scientific theories, such as the [[theory of evolution]]. Rabbis who have this view base their conclusions on verses in the [[Talmud]] or in the [[midrash]]. For example:

* The [[Midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;רבה בראשית ט אות ב&lt;/ref&gt; says: God created many worlds but was not satisfied, and left the world he was satisfied with.
* Rabbi Moshe Ben Nachman (1194–1270) writes:&lt;ref&gt;בראשית א א&lt;/ref&gt; In the first day God created the energy (כח) "matter" (חומר) of all things, and then he was finished with the main creation. After that God created all other things from that energy.
* Some midrashim state that the "first week" of Creation lasted for extremely long periods of time. See Anafim on [[Bahya ben Asher|Rabbenu Bachya's]] Sefer Ikkarim 2:18; Midrash Bereshit Rabbah 9.

==Medieval rabbinic teachings==
[[File:Flickr - USCapitol - Maimonides (1135-1204).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sculpture of Maimonides in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].]]
In his commentary on the Torah, Rabbi [[Bahya ben Asher]] (11th century, Spain) concludes that there were many time systems occurring in the universe long before the spans of history that man is familiar with. Based on the Kabbalah he calculates that the Earth is billions of years old.&lt;ref&gt;Dov Ginzburg, ''The Age of the Earth from Judaic Traditional Literature'', Earth Sciences History, Vol. 3, No. 2 (1984), pp. 169-173. [http://earthscienceshistory.org/doi/abs/10.17704/eshi.3.2.ml66h618g202x677?journalCode=eshi Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some medieval philosophical rationalists, such as [[Maimonides]] and [[Gersonides]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Natan Slifkin|Slifkin, Rabbi Natan]]. ''The Challenge of Creation'', (New York: Yashar Books 2006) page 200.&lt;/ref&gt; held that not every statement in Genesis is meant literally.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guide to the Perplexed]], 2:17&lt;/ref&gt; In this view, one was obligated to understand Torah in a way that was compatible with the findings of [[science]]. Indeed, [[Maimonides]], one of the great Rabbis of the [[Middle Ages]], wrote that if science and Torah were misaligned, it was either because science was not understood or the Torah was misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', 2:25&lt;/ref&gt; Maimonides argued that if science proved a point that did not contradict any fundamentals of faith, then the finding should be accepted and scripture should be interpreted accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book II, chapter 25&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in discussing [[Plato]]'s view that the universe has existed literally forever, he argued that there was no convincing rational proof one way or the other, so that he (Maimonides) was free to accept, and therefore did accept, the literal Biblical view that the universe came into being at a definite time; but that had Plato's Theory been convincing enough with sufficient scientific proof he would have been able to reinterpret Genesis accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book 2, Chapter 25. See [http://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed,_Part_2.25.2?lang=bi http://www.sefaria.org/Guide_for_the_Perplexed] of M. Friedländer's translation, 1919 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], Maimonides stated that "the account given in scripture is not, as is generally believed, intended to be in all its parts literal." Later in the same paragraph, he specifically states that this applies to the text from the beginning to the account of the sixth day of creation.&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides. ''The Guide for the Perplexed'', Book II, chapter 29.  See [https://books.google.com/books?id=a2dRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA211 page 211] of M. Friedländer's translation, 1919 ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nahmanides]], often critical of the rationalist views of Maimonides, pointed out (in his commentary to Genesis) several non-sequiturs stemming from a literal translation of the Bible's account of Creation, and stated that the account actually symbolically refers to spiritual concepts. He quoted the [[Mishnah]] in Tractate [[Hagigah]] which states that the actual meaning of the Creation account, mystical in nature, was traditionally transmitted from teachers to advanced scholars in a private setting. Many classic [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] sources mention ''Shmitot'' - cosmic cycles of creation, similar to the Indian concept of [[yugas]]. [[Nahmanides|Nahmanides']] disciple, [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre|Rabbi Isaac of Akko]], a prominent Kabbalist of 13th-century, held that the Universe is about 15 billion years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Immortality, resurrection, and the age of the universe: a kabbalistic view |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cajobAjRh3IC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=Sefer+Ha+Temunah+forms+of+Hebrew+letters&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=63uku8qBxt&amp;sig=vrE3UQjPFp9dXtFsi_AdoVRKSOA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=y8s5TJa6AYn4sAP52NxR&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Sefer%20Ha%20Temunah%20forms%20of%20Hebrew%20letters&amp;f=false|publisher= Ktav Publishing House |date=January 1993 |first1= Aryeh |last1= Kaplan |authorlink1= Aryeh Kaplan |page= 9 |ISBN= 978-0-88125-345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the tradition of ''Shmitot'', Genesis talks openly only about the current epoch, while the information about the previous cosmic cycles is hidden in the esoteric reading of the text.

A literal interpretation of the biblical Creation story among classic rabbinic commentators is uncommon. Thus Bible commentator Abraham Ibn Ezra (11th Century) wrote,

''If there appears something in the Torah which contradicts reason…then here one should seek for the solution in a figurative interpretation…the narrative of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, for instance, can only be understood in a figurative sense.''

One of several notable exceptions may be the [[Tosafists|Tosafist]] commentary on [[Tractate Rosh Hashanah]], where there seems to be an allusion to the age of creation according to a literal reading of Genesis. The non-literal approach is accepted by many as a possible approach within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and some segments of [[Haredi Judaism]].

[[Rashi]], while his commentary on the verses describing the days of creation teaches them as literal days, brackets his discussion of Genesis ch. 1 with comments stating that the entire world was created at once, with no duration of existence before Adam being specified.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Genesis 1:1, sv "בראשית ברא"; and 2:2 sv "תולדות השמים"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 13th century, Rabbi [[Isaac ben Samuel of Acre]] made the insight that, since Sabbatical cycles existed before man was created, time before Adam and Eve must be measured in divine years, not human years. Psalm 90:4 says, "For a thousand years in thy sight are but like yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night." Rabbi Isaac of Akko - who held like Livnat Ha-Sapir, that we are in the seventh Sabbatical cycle - therefore took the above figure of 42,000 years and multiplied it by 365,250 (he was using a 365.25-day year) to get 15,340,500,000 years for the age of the universe when Adam was created.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com.au/books?id=cajobAjRh3IC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Rabbi+Isaac+of+Akko&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=65tcoamBDm&amp;sig=JwpywnRpPKUglv5pBrU189z8UJk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi8pLHqwYPMAhUEHKYKHaLzBpgQ6AEIPTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Rabbi%20Isaac%20of%20Akko&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yashanet.com/library/missing_link.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish views in reaction to Darwin==
With the advent of [[Charles Darwin]]'s evolutionary theory, the Jewish community found itself engaged in a discussion of [[Jewish principles of faith]] and modern scientific findings.

===Post-1800 Kabbalistic views of compatibility===
Rabbi [[Elijah Benamozegh]], an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[kabbalah|Kabbalist]], wrote that were evolution to become a mainstay of scientific theory, it would not contradict the Torah as long as one understood it as having been guided by God.&lt;ref&gt;''Em LeMikra'' ([[Livorno]] 1863) commenting on [[Deuteronomy]] 22:10, page 87a-88b&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Israel Lipschitz]] of Danzig (19th century) gave a famous lecture on Torah and [[paleontology]], which is printed in the ''Yachin u-Boaz'' edition of the [[Mishnah]], after Massechet Sanhedrin. He writes that Kabbalistic texts teach that the world has gone through many cycles of history, each lasting for many tens of thousands of years. He links these teachings to findings about [[geology]] from European, American and Asian geologists, and from findings from paleontologists.  He discusses the wooly [[mammoth]] discovered in 1807 Siberia, Russia, and the remains of several then-famous [[dinosaur]] skeletons recently unearthed.  Finding no contradiction between this and Jewish teachings, he states "From all this, we can see that all the Kabbalists have told us for so many centuries about the fourfold destruction and renewal of the Earth has found its clearest possible confirmation in our time."

When [[scientists]] first developed the theory of evolution, this idea was seized upon by Rabbis such as [[Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin]], known as the Netziv, who saw Kabbalah as a way to resolve the differences between traditional readings of the Bible and modern day scientific findings.  He proposed that the ancient fossils of dinosaurs were the remains of beings that perished in the previous "worlds" described in [[midrash]]&lt;ref&gt;מדרש רבה בראשית פרשה ט אות י&lt;/ref&gt; and in some Kabbalistic texts. This was the view held by Rabbi [[Aryeh Kaplan]] (1934–1983).

===Late 19th century Orthodox view of evolution===

[[File:Samson Raphael Hirsch (FL12173324).crop.jpg|thumb| Samson Raphael Hirsch]]
In the late 1880s, Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]], an influential leader in the early opposition to non-Orthodox forms of Judaism, wrote that while he did not endorse the idea of [[common descent]] (that all life developed from one common [[organism]]), even if science ever did prove the factuality of Evolution, it would not pose a threat to Orthodox Judaism's beliefs. He posited that belief in [[Evolution]] could instead cause one to be more reverent of God by understanding His wonders (a master plan for the [[universe]]).
:This will never change, not even if the latest scientific notion that the genesis of all the multitudes of organic forms on earth can be traced back to one single, most primitive, primeval form of life should ever appear to be anything more than what it is today, a vague hypothesis still unsupported by fact. Even if this notion were ever to gain complete acceptance by the scientific world, Jewish thought, unlike the reasoning of the high priest of that notion, would nonetheless never summon us to revere a still extant representative of this primal form as the supposed ancestor of us all. Rather, Judaism in that case would call upon its adherents to give even greater reverence than ever before to the one, sole God Who, in His boundless creative wisdom and eternal omnipotence, needed to bring into existence no more than one single, amorphous nucleus and one single law of "adaptation and heredity" in order to bring forth, from what seemed chaos but was in fact a very definite order, the infinite variety of species we know today, each with its unique characteristics that sets it apart from all other creatures. (Collected Writings, vol. 7 pp. 263-264)

By the early to mid-1900s, the majority of [[Conservative Judaism]] and [[Reform Judaism]] came to accept the existence of evolution as a scientific fact. They interpreted Genesis and related Jewish teachings in light of this fact.

===Modern-day Orthodox Jewish views===
The [[Rabbinical Council of America]] (RCA) has "maintained that evolutionary theory, properly understood, is not incompatible with belief in a Divine Creator, nor with the first 2 chapters of Genesis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Creation, Evolution, and Intelligent Design |publisher=Rabbinical Council of America |year=2005 |url=http://www.rabbis.org/news/article.cfm?id=100635}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominent Orthodox rabbis who have affirmed that the world is older, and that life has evolved over time include Israel Lipschitz, [[Sholom Mordechai Schwadron]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}} (the MaHaRSHaM) (1835–1911), [[Zvi Hirsch Chajes]] (1805–1855) and [[Abraham Isaac Kook]] (1865–1935). These rabbis proposed their own versions of [[theistic evolution]], in which the world is older, and that life does evolve over time in accord with natural law, painting natural law as the process by which God drives the world.

There is, in parallel, a discussion on this subject by scientists in the Orthodox Jewish community. One of the most prominent is [[Gerald Schroeder]], an [[MIT]] trained [[physicist]]. He has written a number of articles and popular books attempting to reconcile Jewish theology with modern scientific findings that the world is billions of years old and that life has evolved over time. His work has received approbations from a number of Orthodox rabbinic authorities. Other physicists writing on this topic include [[Alvin Radkowsky]], [[Nathan Aviezer]], [[Herman Branover]], [[Cyril Domb]], [[Aryeh Kaplan]] and [[Yehuda (Leo) Levi]].

Various popular works, citing an array of classical, Orthodox views, attempt to reconcile traditional Jewish texts with modern scientific findings concerning evolution, the age of the earth and the age of the Universe; these include:
*[[Nathan Aviezer]]: ''In the Beginning, Biblical Creation and Science''; ''Fossils and Faith: Understanding Torah and Science''
*[[Aryeh Carmell]] and [[Cyril Domb]], ed.: ''Challenge: Torah Views on Science and Its Problems''
*[[Daniel E. Friedmann]]: ''The Genesis One Code: Demonstrates a clear alignment between the times of key events described in the Genesis with those derived from scientific observation.'' and ''The Broken Gift: Harmonizing the Biblical and scientific accounts of human origins''
*[[Aryeh Kaplan]]: ''Immortality, Resurrection and the Age of the Universe: A Kabbalistic View''
*[[Yehuda (Leo) Levi|Yehuda Levi]]: ''Torah and Science - Their Interplay in the World Scheme''
*[[Jonathan Sacks]]: ''The Great Partnership: God, Science and the Search For Meaning''
*[[Gerald Schroeder]]: ''Genesis and the Big Bang: The Discovery of Harmony Between Modern Science and the Bible''; ''The Science of God''
*[[Natan Slifkin]]: ''[[The Challenge of Creation]]''

===Modern-day Conservative Jewish views===

[[Conservative Judaism]] embraces science as a way to learn about the world,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} and, like Modern Orthodox and Reform Judaism, has not found the theory of evolution a challenge to traditional Jewish theology. The Conservative Jewish movement has not yet developed one official response to the subject, but a broad array of views has converged. Conservative Jews teach that God created the universe and is responsible for the creation of life within it, but proclaims no mandatory teachings about how this occurs.

Many Conservative Rabbis embrace the term [[theistic evolution]], and reject the term [[intelligent design]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  Conservative rabbis who use the term ''intelligent design'' in their sermons often distinguish their views from the Christian use of the term. Like most in the scientific community, they understand "intelligent design" to be a technique by Christians to insert religion into public schools, as admitted in the [[Intelligent design movement]]'s "[[wedge strategy]]".

The Central Conference of American Rabbis is opposed to the teaching of creationism in public schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Central Conference of American Rabbis |title=Religion and the Public Schools |year=1987 |url=http://www.ccarnet.org/rabbis-speak/resolutions/all/religion-and-the-public-schools-1987/}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the Rabbinical Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Resolution on Intelligent Design and the Freedom of Scientific Inquiry|year= 2006|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/resolution-intelligent-design-and-freedom-scientific-inquiry?tp=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservative Judaism strongly supports the use of science as the proper way to learn about the physical world in which we live, and thus encourages its adherents to find a way to understand evolution in a way that does not contradict the findings of scientific research. The tension between accepting God's role in the world and the findings of science, however, is not resolved, and a wide array of views exists. Some mainstream examples of Conservative Jewish thought are as follows:

Professor [[Ismar Schorsch]], former chancellor of the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], writes that:
:The Torah's story of creation is not intended as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in the very nature of things. And I would argue that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.

Rabbi [[David J. Fine]], who has authorized official [[responsa]] for the Conservative movement's [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]], expresses a common Conservative Jewish view on the subject:

:Conservative Judaism has always been premised on the total embrace of critical inquiry and science. More than being compatible with Conservative Judaism, I would say that it is a mitzvah to learn about the world and the way it works to the best of our abilities, since that is to marvel with awe at God's handiwork. To not do so is sinful.
:
:But here's where the real question lies. Did God create the world, or not? Is it God's handiwork? Many of the people who accept evolution, even many scientists, believe in what is called "theistic evolution," that is, that behind the billions of years of cosmic and biological evolution, there is room for belief in a creator, God, who set everything into motion, and who stands outside the universe as the cause and reason for life. The difference between that and "intelligent design" is subtle yet significant. Believing scientists claim that belief in God is not incompatible with studying evolution since science looks only for the natural explanations for phenomena. The proponents of intelligent design, on the other hand, deny the ability to explain life on earth through solely natural explanations. That difference, while subtle, is determinative.
:David J. Fine, ''Intelligent Design''

Rabbi Michael Schwab writes:
:...the Jewish view on the first set of questions is much closer to the picture painted by adherents to intelligent design than to those who are strict Darwinians. Judaism, as a religion, and certainly Conservative Judaism, sees creation as a purposeful process directed by God, however each individual defines the Divine. This is clearly in consonance with the theory of Intelligent Design. What Darwin sees as random, we see as the miraculous and natural unfolding of God’s subtle and beautiful plan.
:...However, as unlikely as it may seem, this does not mean for one moment that Judaism’s view rejects wholesale the veracity of Darwin’s theory. In fact, I believe that it is easy to incorporate Darwin and Intelligent design into a meaningful conception of how we humans came into being...
:We have frameworks built into our system to integrate the findings of science into our religious and theological beliefs. That is because we believe that the natural world, and the way it works, was created by God and therefore its workings must be consistent with our religious beliefs.
:...One of the most well known ways our tradition has been able to hold onto both the scientific theory of evolution as well as the concept of a purposeful creation was by reading the creation story in Genesis in a more allegorical sense. One famous medieval commentary proclaims that the days of creation, as outlined in the book of Bereshit, could be seen as representative of the stages of creation and not literal 24 hour periods. Thus each Biblical day could have accounted for thousands or even millions of years. In that way the progression according to both evolution and the Torah remains essentially the same: first the elements were created, then the waters, the plants, the animals, and finally us. Therefore, Genesis and Darwin can both be right in a factual analysis even while we acknowledge that our attitudes towards these shared facts are shaped much more strongly by the Torah – we agree how the process unfolded but disagree that it was random.
:Parshat Noah -- November 4, 2005, ''How Did We Get Here?'' Michael Schwab

The claim that evolution is [[teleological|purposeful]] is in conflict with modern-day evolutionary theory.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  The precise way in which God inserts design is not specified by Schwab or other rabbis.

Rabbi [[Lawrence Troster]] is a critic of positions such as this. He holds that much of Judaism (and other religions) have not successfully created a theology which allows for the role of God in the world and yet is also fully compatible with modern-day evolutionary theory. Troster maintains that the solution to resolving the tension between classical theology and modern science can be found in [[process theology]], such as in the writings of [[Hans Jonas]], whose view of an evolving God within process philosophy contains no inherent contradictions between theism and scientific naturalism.
:Lecture ''God after Darwin: Evolution and the Order of Creation'' October 21, 2004, Lishmah, New York City, Larry Troster
In a paper on Judaism and [[environmentalism]], Troster writes:
:Jonas is the only Jewish philosopher who has fully integrated philosophy, science, theology and environmental ethics. He maintained that humans have a special place in Creation, manifest in the concept that humans are created in the image of God. His philosophy is very similar to that of Alfred North Whitehead, who believed that God is not static but dynamic, in a continual process of becoming as the universe evolves.

==Jewish opposition to Darwinian theory==

Whilst the Reform, Conservative and Modern Orthodox movements have stated that they feel there is not a conflict between evolutionary theory and the teachings of Judaism, some [[Haredi]] rabbis have remained staunchly opposed to certain teachings in [[evolution]]ary theory. In contrast with the literalist biblical interpretation of some Christian [[creationism|creationists]], they express an openness to multiple interpretations of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], through Jewish [[Oral Torah|oral tradition]] and [[Kabbalah|Jewish mysticism]]. They have also expressed an openness to evolutionary theory in biology, except where they perceive that it is in conflict with the [[Torah]]'s account of creation.

Rabbi [[Avigdor Miller]], a highly revered American Haredi rabbi of the [[Litvish|Lithuanian Yeshivah Tradition]], who was also highly respected in Hasidic communities such as Satmar, was strongly opposed to the theory of evolution, and wrote strong polemics against evolution in several of his books, as well as speaking about this subject often in his popular lectures, taking a Creationist position. Several selections from his books on this subject were collected in a pamphlet he published in 1995 called "The Universe Testifies".

Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]], the Rebbe of the worldwide movement of Lubavitcher or [[Chabad]] [[Hasidism]], was avidly opposed to evolution opposed to evolution, and his following remains committed to that position.&lt;ref&gt; https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/112083/jewish/Theories-of-Evolution.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbi [[Avi Shafran]], a spokesman for [[Agudath Israel of America|Agudath Israel]], writes a weekly column that is  widely syndicated in the Jewish press. As an opponent of Darwinian evolutionary theory, Shafran is careful to distinguish the Jewish perspective from that of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, "An unfortunate side-effect of our affirmation of purpose in creation at a time of controversy is the assumption made by some that we believing Jews share some other groups’ broader skepticism of science. But while Torah-faithful Jews reject the blind worship of science, we do not regard science as an enemy." Quite the contrary, Shafran remarks, Judaism seeks to learn as much as possible from God's creation.

Shafran also rejects the literalism of Christian fundamentalism. He writes, "Nor is 'Biblical literalism' a Jewish approach. Many are the ''p’sukim'' (verses) that do not mean what a simple reading would yield." To Shafran, the Jewish oral tradition is the key to the true meaning of the Torah's words. "There are multiple levels of deeper meanings inaccessible to most of us. The words of ''Breishis'' (Genesis, [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazi]] [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]) and the [[Midrash]]im thereon hide infinitely more than they reveal. It is clear that the Torah describes the creation of the universe as the willful act of ''HaKodosh Boruch Hu'' (the Holy One), and describes creation as having unfolded in stages. But details are hardly provided."&lt;ref name=Menken&gt;{{cite web | publisher = Cross-Currents |date=December 22, 2005 |title=Rabbi Avi Shafran on Intelligent Design |last=Menken |first=Yaakov |url=http://www.cross-currents.com/archives/2005/12/22/rabbi-avi-shafran-on-intelligent-design/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Some contemporary Orthodox Jews writers are concerned that if evolution is accepted as true, then it could lead to the Torah being deemed not only irrelevant but also false. Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb has argued that for Jews accepting evolution is equivalent to accepting atheism. The Israeli microbiologist Morris Goldman has written that Darwinism is a problem for Judaism, since Darwinism makes god irrelevant. Other issues are that evolution can provide a non religious basis for the development of morality, and it removes the idea that humans are qualitatively different from other animals.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Tradition and the Challenge of Darwinism, G. N. Cantor, Marc Swetlitz, University of Chicago Press, 15 Nov 2006, pg 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slifkin affair===

{{Main|Natan Slifkin}}
[[File:Slifkin.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Natan Slifkin|Rabbi Natan Slifkin]]]]
In 2004-2005, three popular books by Rabbi [[Natan Slifkin]] (sometimes pronounced ''Nosson'' Slifkin) were banned by a group of [[Haredi]] rabbinic authorities on the grounds that they were heretical. Known to his admirers as the "Zoo Rabbi," Nosson Slifkin was the author of ''The Torah Universe'', a series of books on science and religion that were widely read in Orthodox communities until they were suddenly banned. "The books written by Nosson Slifkin present a great [[stumbling block]] to the reader," the ban declared. "They are full of heresy, twist and misrepresent the words of our sages and ridicule the foundations of our ''emunah'' (faith)." The ban, which prohibited Jews from reading, owning, or distributing Slifkin's books, prompted a widespread backlash in the Orthodox Jewish community.

Jennie Rothenberg, reporting on this ban in the secular Jewish journal, ''[[Moment (magazine)|Moment]]'', asserted that the incident represents a major breaking point within ultra-Orthodox society. Rothenberg interviewed several rabbis who wished to remain anonymous. According to one of them, "Over the past 15 years, the rabbis of [[Bnei Brak, Israel|Bnai Brak]] and the more open American ultra-Orthodox rabbis have been split on a number of important policy decisions. The Slifkin ban is a huge break. It’s a kind of power struggle, and those who didn’t sign the ban are outraged right now. I’m talking about rabbis with long white beards who are furious about it." Slifkin’s views, according to this rabbi, are shared by countless figures within the ultra-Orthodox community. "He’s saying out loud what a lot of people have been talking about quietly all along. To those people, he’s a kind of figurehead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Moment Magazine |title=The Heresy of Nosson Slifkin |last=Rothenberg |first=Jennie |date=October 2005 |url=http://momentmag.com/features/oct05/slifkin.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120174348/http://momentmag.com/features/oct05/slifkin.html |archivedate=November 20, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orthodox scientists respond to Darwin==

Several Modern Orthodox Jewish scientists have interpreted creation in light of both modern scientific findings and rabbinical interpretations of Genesis. Each of these scientists have claimed that modern science actually confirms a literal interpretation of [[Torah]]. All of them accept the scientific evidence that the age of the [[Earth]] and the age of the universe are on a scale of billions of years, and all of them acknowledge that the diversity of species on Earth can be explained through an evolutionary framework. However, each of them interprets certain aspects of evolution or the emergence of modern humans as a divine process, rather than a natural one. Thus, each of them accepts an evolutionary paradigm, while rejecting some aspects of Darwinism. [[Shai Cherry]] writes, "While twentieth century Jewish theologians have tended to compartmentalize science and the Torah, our Modern Orthodox physicists synthesized them.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Nathan Aviezer]]''', a physicist who trained at the [[University of Chicago]], allows for divine guidance within an evolutionary paradigm in the transmutation of species over time, including the emergence of modern man from ''[[Homo erectus]]''. As a physicist, he interprets the six days of creation as broadly referring to large periods of time, an interpretation for which he cites rabbinic sources, including [[Maimonides]] and [[Nachmanides]]. For Aviezer, the evolutionary framework applies, except where the Hebrew verb ''bara'' (''create'') is used. To Aviezer, "It is particularly meaningful that Modern Man is intellectually and culturally so vastly superior to his closest relative, the extinct [[Neanderthal Man]], even though both species are very similar." He explains this through a literal interpretation of Genesis 1:27 &amp;mdash; "And God ''created'' Man in His image."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 169-172.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gerald Schroeder]]''', an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] trained physicist, believes that modern science contains nothing inimical to a literal reading of Genesis. Indeed, modern science allows one to understand the "true literal meaning of the Creation narrative." To Schroeder, it is Einstein's relativity, the "distortion of time facing backwards in a forward rushing cosmos," that accounts for the compression of time in a 15-billion year-old universe into six days of creation. To Schroeder, the emergence of modern man can be dated to the beginning of writing. Archeologists date the first writing, he notes, "at five or six thousand years ago, the exact period that the Bible tells us the soul of Adam, the ''[[Soul#Judaism|neshama]]'', was created." To Schroeder, who cites the [[Targum]] of [[Onkelos]], Adam was the first man who could write, and the creation of Adam from more primitive man was a divine ensoulment.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 173-177.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Judah Landa]]''', a physicist and teacher at, among other institutions, the [[Yeshiva of Flatbush]], takes a completely different approach. To Landa, [[genetic mutation]] is not a random process, but a divinely guided one that only appears random to humanity. "Evolution was designed and guided, just as the putting together of words and sentences into book forms is accomplished only by design and guidance. A book is designed by its author, evolution was (and continues to be) designed by the laws of nature (which in turn, were designed, we believe, by God).&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Where Landa differs from Darwin is in his rejection of the Darwinian notion that evolution has no purpose. Landa does not claim that there is proof of a final purpose for life; he merely asserts that science cannot rule one out. He writes, "God may very well have designed the laws of the universe and the earliest forms of matter and energy with particular life-forms as end-products in mind. Evolution and natural selection may be the vehicles he chose and designed to achieve His purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Aviezar and Schroeder, Landa reconciles science with the biblical account of Genesis, taken literally, but he does so through literary interpretation.

[[Shai Cherry]], Professor of Jewish Thought at [[Vanderbilt University]], remarks that these Modern Orthodox scientists have rejected the approach taken by Jewish theologians. Theologians have tended to use later writings, such as [[Midrash]] and [[Kabbalah]], to reconcile modern science with Genesis. The Orthodox scientists, by comparison, have largely ignored Jewish theology, in favor of a fundamentalist and literalist interpretation of Genesis. Yet in their writings, each of them seeks to reconcile science with Genesis. Cherry speculates, "They were targeting an American Jewish community that privileges science over Torah as a source of scientific knowledge. If Genesis could be shown to have anticipated Darwin or Einstein, then the Bible would regain an aura of truth that it had been losing since the advent of biblical criticism and modern science."&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cherry, the books of Aviezar, Schroeder, and Landa have each sought to strengthen Orthodox Jewry in a time of mounting secularization. Aviezar and Schroeder sought to prove that Genesis anticipates the findings of modern science, and thus increase its status. By contrast, Landa sought to remove a barrier to Orthodox commitment, by proving to secular Jews that Orthodox Judaism and modern science are compatible. At the same time, he sought to persuade students in his own Orthodox community that the study of science is not incompatible with commitment to Orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;Cherry(2006). 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nathan Robertson a researcher in Biophysics has also released a book titled "The First Six Days" which claims to reconcile the scientific theory of the beginnings of the universe and life with the biblical account of creation. Rabbinical sources are cited from Nachmanides (Ramban) and Rashi along with kabbalistic interpretations of Genesis. Nathan reconciles Darwinian evolution with the biblical account and states that at deeper levels of understanding of the biblical text and of scientific theory, the two worlds overlap. "As one studies science to deeper levels and also tries to study Bereshis [Genesis] to deeper levels, both principles begin to converge on each other."

==Jewish reactions to intelligent design==
{{Main|Jewish reactions to intelligent design}}

The movement for [[intelligent design]] claims that an intelligent creator is responsible for the [[origin of life]] and of humankind, and rejects evolution. Jewish theologians, organizations, and activists have maintained that intelligent design is not valid science but that it is a religious concept. Although some have expressed support for a theistic interpretation of evolution, they have generally rejected the tenets of the intelligent design movement. To Rabbi [[Brad Hirschfield]], President of the [[National Jewish Center for Learning and Leadership]], intelligent design is "their attempt to confirm what they already believe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hirschfield |first=Brad |title=The Origins of Life: A Jewish Perspective |publisher=National Public Radio |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4761360 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish organizations in the [[United States]] have been steadfast in their opposition to the teaching of intelligent design in public schools, charging that to do so would violate the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2202">'''Laboratoire Agit'Art''' was an art collective founded in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]] in 1973 by writer and performer [[Youssouf John]] with goal of revitalising artistic production and critique institutional frameworks and the philosophy of [[Negritude]] in particular. John soon left for Martinique and the group/workshop was handed on to [[Issa Samb]].&lt;ref&gt;p.106, In Senghor′s Shadow: Art, Politics, and the Avant-Garde in Senegal, 1960–1995. Author(s): Elizabeth Harney: Published: 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Other key members included {{Interlanguage link multi|El Hadj Sy|fr}} (El Sy), {{Interlanguage link multi|Bouna Medoune Seye|fr}}, [[Djibril Diop Mambéty]], and Youssoupha Dione.&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary |title=Glossary of art terms |publisher= [[Tate]] |location=UK |accessdate=15 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MMA-afu11&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/?period=11&amp;region=afu#/Key-Events |title= Western and Central Sudan, 1900 A.D.–present: Key Events |work= Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=[[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] |location=New York |accessdate=15 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group consisting of artists, writers, film-makers, performance artists and musicians. The group was based at Dakar's squatted [[Village des Arts]] until the squatted village was evicted by the army ion 23 September 1983&lt;ref&gt;p. 143, In Senghor′s Shadow: Art, Politics, and the Avant-Garde in Senegal, 1960–1995. Author(s): Elizabeth Harney: Published: 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The collective made work in a variety of medium, including paint, found objects, sculpture, performance art and street art. Their exhibitions were organised around satyrical theatrical productions of [[Leopold Senghor]] and [[Aime Cesaire]]'s works. The collective marked a move away from [[Negritude]] philosophy of Senghor and Cesaire and towards a more avant-garde critique of both modernism and traditional ideas while still drawing from both.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2507">'''Margareta Birgersdotter Grip''' (1538–1586), was a Swedish baroness, writer and landowner. She is known for her writing: she copied letters and documents from the Middle Ages, the originals of which have since been lost, and for her genealogical research. Genealogical works became common among the nobility after her day, and her work is considered the first of the genre in Sweden.

==Life==
She was born to ''[[riksråd]]'' baron Birger Nilsson Grip and Brita Joachimsdotter Brahe. In 1562, she married the noble Erik Månsson [[Natt och Dag]], son of Måns Johansson and [[Barbro Eriksdotter]]. She was thereby the sister-in-law of the lady-in-waiting [[Karin Gyllenstierna]], who were also her neighbor on the estate [[Säby]]. After being widowed shortly after, she managed the estate [[Brokind Castle]] on behalf of her minor son Erik Eriksson Natt och Dag (d. 1566). After the death of her son, she inherited the Bro estate personally. In 1571, she married riksråd [[Sten Axelsson Banér]]. However, she remained the sole manager of the Bro estate.

Traditionally, Margareta Birgersdotter Grip has been named [[Mistress of the Robes]] of Queen [[Karin Månsdotter]] in 1567-1568. However, [[Elin Andersdotter]] is confirmed to have had that position.&lt;ref&gt;Sture Arnell (1951). Karin Månsdotter. Stockholm: Wahlström &amp; Widstrand. ISBN&lt;/ref&gt;

Margareta Grip copied a large amount of documents and letters from the Middle Ages, whose originals have since been lost, and who are therefore important historical documents. She produced a genealogical work, with the intent of vindicating her ancestor, [[Bo Jonsson Grip]], a work she started in 1574. Genealogical research became common among the nobility in the late 16th century, but Grip are regarded as the pioneer of this genre in Sweden. Her work is kept at the [[Trolleholm Castle]] archive.

'''Microforms''' are scaled-down reproductions of documents, typically either [[photographic film|films]] or paper, made for the purposes of transmission, storage, reading, and printing. Microform images are commonly reduced to about one twenty-fifth of the original document size. For special purposes, greater optical reductions may be used.

All microform images may be provided as positives or negatives, more often the latter.

Three formats are common: '''microfilm''' (reels), '''microfiche''' (flat sheets), and [[aperture card]]s. '''Microcards''', a format no longer produced, were similar to microfiche, but printed on cardboard rather than photographic film.

==History==
{{Expert needed|Libraries|section|talk=Microform from the 1940s onward|date=April 2015}}
Using the [[daguerreotype]] process, [[John Benjamin Dancer]] was one of the first to produce [[microphotograph]]s, in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He achieved a reduction ratio of 160:1. Dancer perfected his reduction procedures with [[Frederick Scott Archer]]'s wet [[collodion process]], developed in 1850–51, but he dismissed his decades-long work on microphotographs as a personal hobby, and did not document his procedures. The idea that microphotography could be no more than a novelty was an opinion shared by the 1858 ''Dictionary of Photography,'' which called the process "somewhat trifling and childish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Sutton, Thomas |chapter=Microphotography |editor=Veaner, Allen B. |title=Studies in micropublishing, 1853–1976: documentary sources |publisher=Microform Review Inc |location=Westport, Conn |year=1976 |page=88 |isbn=0-913672-07-6 }} Originally published in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DXQCAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA295 Dictionary of Photography]'' (1858).&lt;/ref&gt;

Microphotography was first suggested as a document preservation method in 1851 by [[James Glaisher]], an astronomer, and in 1853 by [[John Herschel]]. Both men attended the 1851 [[The Great Exhibition|Great Exhibition]] in London, where the exhibit on photography greatly influenced Glaisher. He called it "the most remarkable discovery of modern times", and argued in his official report for using microphotography to preserve documents.&lt;ref&gt;''Exhibition of the Works of Industry of All Nations 1851.  Reports by the Juries on the Subject in the Thirty Classes into which the Exhibition was Divided.'' (London: John Weale, 1852).&lt;/ref&gt;

The developments in microphotography continued through the next decades, but it was not until the turn of the century that its potential for practical usage was seized by a wider audience. In 1896, Canadian engineer [[Reginald A. Fessenden]] suggested microforms were a compact solution to engineers' unwieldy but frequently consulted materials.  He proposed that up to 150,000,000 words could be made to fit in a square inch, and that a one-foot cube could contain 1.5 million volumes.&lt;ref name=Meckler82/&gt;

In 1906, [[Paul Otlet]] and [[Robert Goldschmidt]] proposed the ''livre microphotographique'' as a way to alleviate the cost and space limitations imposed by the [[codex]] format.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Goldschmidt and Paul Otlet, ''Sur une forme nouvelle du livre— le livre microphotographique,'' L'Institut international de bibliographie, Bulletin, 1907.&lt;/ref&gt;  Otlet’s overarching goal was to create a World Center Library of Juridical, Social and Cultural Documentation, and he saw microfiche as a way to offer a stable and durable format that was inexpensive, easy to use, easy to reproduce, and extremely compact.  In 1925, the team spoke of a massive library where each volume existed as master negatives and positives, and where items were printed on demand for interested patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Goldschmidt and Paul Otlet, "La Conseration et la Diffusion Internationale de la Pensée."  Publication no. 144 of the Institut International de Bibliographie (Brussels).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s microfilm began to be used in a commercial setting. New York City banker George McCarthy was issued a patent in 1925 for his "Checkograph" machine, designed to make micrographic copies of cancelled checks for permanent storage by financial institutions. In 1928, the [[Eastman Kodak Company]] bought McCarthy's invention and began marketing check microfilming devices under its "Recordak" division.&lt;ref name="Heritage"&gt;[http://www.heritagearchives.org/history.html "Brief History of Microfilm,"] Heritage Microfilm, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1927 and 1935, the [[Library of Congress]] microfilmed more than three million pages of books and manuscripts in the [[British Library]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saffady|2000|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1929 the [[Social Science Research Council]] and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] joined to create a Joint Committee on Materials for Research, chaired for most of its existence by [[Robert C. Binkley]], which looked closely at microform’s potential to serve small print runs of academic or technical materials. In 1933, Charles C. Peters developed a method to microformat dissertations, and in 1934 the United States [[National Agriculture Library]] implemented the first microform print-on-demand service, which was quickly followed by a similar commercial concern, Science Service.&lt;ref name=Meckler82&gt;{{cite book |author=Meckler, Alan M. |title=Micropublishing: a history of scholarly micropublishing in America, 1938–1980 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, CT |year=1982 |isbn=0-313-23096-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Kodak's Recordak division began filming and publishing ''[[The New York Times]]'' on reels of 35 millimeter microfilm, ushering in the era of newspaper preservation on film.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; This method of information storage received the sanction of the [[American Library Association]] at its annual meeting in 1936, when it officially endorsed microforms.

[[Harvard University Library]] was the first major institution to realize the potential of microfilm to preserve [[broadsheet]]s printed on high-acid newsprint and it launched its "Foreign Newspaper Project" to preserve such ephemeral publications in 1938.&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; Roll microfilm proved far more satisfactory as a storage medium than earlier methods of film information storage, such as the Photoscope, the Film-O-Graph, the Fiske-O-Scope, and filmslides.

The year 1938 also saw another major event in the history of microfilm when [[University Microfilms International]] (UMI) was established by [[Eugene Power]].&lt;ref name="Heritage" /&gt; For the next half century, UMI would dominate the field, filming and distributing microfilm editions of current and past publications and academic dissertations. After another short-lived name change, UMI was made a part of [[ProQuest|ProQuest Information and Learning]] in 2001.

Systems that mount microfilm images in [[punched card]]s have been widely used for archival storage of engineering information.

For example, when [[airline]]s demand archival engineering drawings to support purchased equipment (in case the vendor goes out of business, for example), they normally specify punch-card-mounted microfilm with an industry-standard indexing system punched into the card. This permits automated reproduction, as well as permitting mechanical card-sorting equipment to sort and select microfilm drawings.

Aperture card mounted microfilm is roughly 3% of the size and space of conventional paper or vellum engineering drawings. Some military contracts around 1980 began to specify digital storage of engineering and maintenance data because the expenses were even lower than microfilm, but these programs are now finding it difficult to purchase new readers for the old formats.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

Microfilm first saw military use during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71. During the [[Siege de Paris (1870-1871)|Siege of Paris]], the only way for the provincial government in [[Tours]] to communicate with Paris was by [[pigeon post]]. As the pigeons could not carry paper dispatches, the Tours government turned to microfilm. Using a microphotography unit evacuated from [[Paris]] before the siege, clerks in Tours photographed paper dispatches and compressed them to microfilm, which were carried by homing pigeons into Paris and projected by [[magic lantern]] while clerks copied the dispatches onto paper.&lt;ref name=ucla&gt;{{cite web|work=The History of Microfilm: 1839 To The Present|title=The Pigeon Post into Paris 1870–1871 |url=http://www.srlf.ucla.edu/exhibit/text/hist_page4.htm |publisher=University of California, Southern Regional Library Facility}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the US [[V-mail|Victory Mail]], and the British "Airgraph" system it was based on, were used for delivering mail between those at home and troops serving overseas during [[World War II]]. The systems worked by photographing large amounts of [[Postal censorship|censored mail]] reduced to thumb-nail size onto reels of microfilm, which weighed much less than the originals would have. The film reels were shipped by priority air freight to and from the home fronts, sent to their prescribed destinations for enlarging at receiving stations near the recipients, and printed out on lightweight photo paper. These facsimiles of the [[Letter sheet|letter-sheets]] were reproduced about one-quarter the original size and the miniature mails were then delivered to the addressee. Use of these microfilm systems saved significant volumes of cargo capacity needed for vital war supplies. An additional benefit was that the small, lightweight reels of microfilm were almost always transported by air, and as such were delivered much more quickly than any surface [[mail]] service could have managed.

[[Libraries]] began using microfilm in the mid-20th century as a preservation strategy for deteriorating newspaper collections. Books and newspapers that were deemed in danger of decay could be preserved on film and thus access and use could be increased. Microfilming was also a space-saving measure. In his 1945 book, ''The Scholar and the Future of the Research Library'', [[Fremont Rider]] calculated that research libraries were doubling in space every sixteen years.  His suggested solution was microfilming, specifically with his invention, the microcard. Once items were put onto film, they could be removed from circulation and additional shelf space would be made available for rapidly expanding collections. The microcard was superseded by microfiche. By the 1960s, microfilming had become standard policy.

Around the same time, Licensed Betting Offices in the UK began using microphotography as a means of keeping compact records of bets taken.  Betting shop customers would sometimes attempt to amend their betting slip receipt to attempt fraud, and so the microphotography camera (which also generally contained its own independent time-piece) found use as a definitive means of recording the exact details of each and every bet taken.  The use of microphotography has now largely been replaced by digital 'bet capture' systems, which also allow a computer to settle the returns for each bet once the details of the wager have been 'translated' into the system by an employee.  The added efficiency of this digital system has ensured that there are now very few, if indeed any, betting offices continuing to use microfilm cameras in the UK.

[[Visa Inc.|Visa]] and [[National City Corp.|National City]] use microfilm (roll microfilm and fiche) to store financial, personal, and legal records.

[[Source code]] for computer programs was printed to microfiche during the 1970s and distributed to customers in this form.

Additionally, microfiche was used to write out long casework for some proofs such as the [[four color theorem]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

==Advantages==
The medium has numerous advantages:
* It enables libraries to greatly expand access to collections without putting rare, fragile, or valuable items at risk of theft or damage.
* It is compact, with far smaller storage costs than paper documents. Normally 98 document size pages fit on one fiche, reducing to about 0.25% original material.  When compared to filing paper, microforms can reduce space storage requirements by up to 95%.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saffady|2000|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* It is cheaper to distribute than paper copy. Most microfiche services get a bulk discount on reproduction rights, and have lower reproduction and carriage costs than a comparable amount of printed paper.
* It is a stable archival form when properly processed and stored. Preservation standard microfilms use the [[silver halide]] process, creating [[silver]] images in hard [[gelatin]] emulsion on a [[polyester]] base. With appropriate storage conditions, this film has a life expectancy of 500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saffady|2000|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in tropical climates with high humidity, [[fungus]] eats the gelatin used to bind the silver halide. Thus, [[diazo]]-based systems with lower archival lives (20 years) which have polyester or [[epoxy]] surfaces are used.
* Since it is analog (an actual image of the original data), it is easy to view. Unlike [[Digital data|digital]] media, the format requires no software to decode the data stored thereon. It is instantly comprehensible to persons literate in the written language; the only equipment that is needed is a simple magnifying glass. This eliminates the problem of software obsolescence.
* It is virtually impossible to mutilate.  Users cannot tear pages from or deface microforms.
* It has low intrinsic value and does not attract thieves.  Few heavily used microform collections suffer major losses due to theft.
* Prints from microfilm are accepted in legal proceedings as substitutes for original documents.

==Disadvantages==
* The principal disadvantage of microforms is that the image is (usually) too small to read with the naked eye and requires analog or digital magnification to be read.
* Reader machines used to view microform are often difficult to use; microfiche is very time consuming and microfilm requires users to carefully wind and rewind until they have arrived at the point where the data they are looking for is stored.
* Photographic illustrations reproduce poorly in microform format, with loss of clarity and halftones. The latest electronic digital viewer/scanners can scan in gray shade, which greatly increases the quality of photographs; but the inherent bi-tonal nature of microfilm limits its ability to convey much subtlety of tone.
* Reader-printers are not always available, limiting the user's ability to make copies for their own purposes.  Conventional photocopy machines cannot be used.&lt;ref name="Sanders-Martin"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sanders, Mark |author2=Martin, Mark |title=Extra!  Extra!  Read all about it!  Newspaper access in the academic library |journal=Louisiana Libraries |volume=67 |issue=1 |pages=18–24 |date=Summer 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Color microform is extremely expensive, thus discouraging most libraries supplying color films.  Color photographic dyes also tend to degrade over the long term.  This results in the loss of information, as color materials are usually photographed using black and white film.&lt;ref name="Sanders-Martin" /&gt; The lack of quality and color images in microfilm, when libraries were discarding paper originals, was a major impetus to [[Bill Blackbeard]] and other comic historians' work to rescue and maintain original paper archives of color pages from the history of newspaper comics.  Many non-comics color images were not targeted by these efforts and were lost.
* When stored in the highest-density drawers, it is easy to misfile a fiche, which is thereafter unavailable. As a result, some libraries store microfiche in a restricted area and retrieve it on demand.  Some fiche services use lower-density drawers with labeled pockets for each card.
* Like all analog media formats, microfiche is lacking in features enjoyed by users of digital media.  Analog copies degrade with each generation, while some digital copies have much higher copying fidelity. Digital data can also be indexed and searched easily.
* Reading microfilms on a machine for some time may cause headache and/or eyestrain.

==Readers and printers==
[[File:Library microfiche reader.jpg|thumb|A microfiche reader in a library]]
Desktop readers are boxes with a translucent screen at the front on to which is projected an image from a microform.  They have suitable fittings for whatever microform is in use. They may offer a choice of magnifications. They usually have motors to advance and rewind film.  When coding blips are recorded on the film a reader is used that can read the blips to find any required image.

Portable readers are plastic devices that fold for carrying; when open they project an image from microfiche on to a reflective screen. For example, with [[M. de Saint Rat]], [[Atherton Seidell]] developed a simple, inexpensive ($2.00 in 1950), monocular microfilm viewing device, known as the "Seidell viewer", that was sold during the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Seidell Microfilm Viewer in Production |journal=American Documentation |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=118 |date=April 1950 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A microfilm printer contains a xerographic copying process, like a [[photocopier]]. The image to be printed is projected with synchronised movement on to the drum. These devices offer either small image preview for the operator or full size image preview, when it is called a reader printer.  Microform printers can accept positive or negative films and positive or negative images on paper.  New machines allow the user to scan a microform image and save it as a digital file: see the section below on digital conversion.

=== Flat film ===

105 x 148&amp;nbsp;mm flat film is used for micro images of very large engineering drawings. These may carry a title photographed or written along one edge. Typical reduction is about 20, representing a drawing that is 2.00 x 2.80 metres, that is 79 x 110 in. These films are stored as microfiche.

=== Microfilm ===

[[16 mm film|16 mm]] or [[35 mm film]] to [[motion picture]] standard is used, usually unperforated. Roll microfilm is stored on open reels or put into cassettes.  The standard lengths for using roll film is 30.48&amp;nbsp;m (100&amp;nbsp;ft) for 35mm rolls, and 100&amp;nbsp;ft, 130&amp;nbsp;ft and 215 feet for 16mm rolls. One roll of 35&amp;nbsp;mm film may carry 600 images of large engineering drawings or 800 images of broadsheet newspaper pages. 16&amp;nbsp;mm film may carry 2,400 images of letter sized images as a single stream of micro images along the film set so that lines of text are parallel to the sides of the film or 10,000 small documents, perhaps cheques or betting slips, with both sides of the originals set side by side on the film.

=== Aperture cards ===

[[Aperture card]]s are [[Punched card#Card formats|Hollerith cards]] into which a hole has been cut. A 35&amp;nbsp;mm microfilm chip is mounted in the hole inside of a clear plastic sleeve, or secured over the aperture by an adhesive tape.  They are used for engineering drawings, for all engineering disciplines. There are libraries of these containing over 3 million cards. Aperture cards may be stored in drawers or in freestanding rotary units.

=== Microfiche ===

[[File:Microfiche_holder.jpg|thumb|alt=Microfiche|A Microfiche holder with microfiches]]
A microfiche is a sheet of flat film, 105 x 148&amp;nbsp;mm in size, the same size as the international standard for paper size [[paper size|ISO A6]]. It carries a matrix of micro images. All microfiche are read with their text parallel to the long side of the [[wikt:fiche|fiche]]. Frames may be [[Page orientation|landscape or portrait in orientation]]. Along the top of the fiche a title may be recorded for visual identification. 

The most commonly used format is a portrait image of about 10 x 14&amp;nbsp;mm. Office-size papers or magazine pages require a reduction of 24 or 25 in size. Microfiche are stored in open-top envelopes which are put in drawers or boxes as [[index cards|file cards]], or fitted into pockets in purpose-made books.

=== Ultrafiche ===

(also 'ultramicrofiche') is an exceptionally compact version of a microfiche or microfilm, storing analog data at much higher densities. Ultrafiche can be created directly from computers using appropriate peripherals. They are typically used for storing data gathered from extremely data-intensive operations such as remote sensing.

==Image creation==
To create microform media, a planetary [[camera]] is mounted with the vertical axis above a copy that is stationary during exposure. High volume output is possible with a rotary camera which moves the copy smoothly through the camera to expose film which moves with the reduced image. Alternatively, it may be produced by computers, i.e. COM (computer output microfilm).

===Film===
Normally microfilming uses high resolution [[panchromatic]] monochrome stock. Positive color film giving good reproduction and high resolution can also be used. Roll film is provided 16, 35 and 105&amp;nbsp;mm wide in lengths of 30 metres (100&amp;nbsp;ft) and longer, and is usually unperforated. Roll film is developed, fixed and washed by continuous processors.

Sheet film is supplied in ISO A6 size. This is either processed by hand or using a dental X-ray processor. Camera film is supplied ready mounted in aperture cards. Aperture cards are developed, fixed and washed immediately after exposure by equipment fitted to the camera.

Early cut sheet microforms and microfilms (to the 1930s) were printed on [[nitrate film]], which poses high risks to their holding institutions, as nitrate film is explosive and flammable. From the late 1930s to the 1980s, microfilms were usually printed on a [[cellulose acetate]] base, which is prone to tears, [[vinegar syndrome]], and redox blemishes.  Vinegar syndrome is the result of chemical decay and produces "buckling and shrinking, embrittlement, and bubbling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1515/mfir.1994.23.1.15 |author=Bourke, Thomas A. |title=The Curse of Acetate; or a Base conundrum Confronted |journal=Microform Review |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=15–17 |year=1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Redox blemishes are yellow, orange or red spots 15–150 micrometres in diameter created by oxidative attacks on the film, and are largely due to poor storage conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Saffady|2000|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cameras===
;Flat film
The simplest microfilm camera that is still in use is a rail mounted structure at the top of which is a bellows camera for 105 x 148&amp;nbsp;mm film. A frame or copy board holds the original drawing vertical. The camera has a horizontal axis which passes through the center of the copy. The structure may be moved horizontally on rails.

In a [[darkroom]] a single film may be inserted into a dark slide or the camera may be fitted with a roll film holder which after an exposure advances the film into a box and cuts the frame off the roll for processing as a single film.

;Roll film
For engineering drawings a freestanding open steel structure is often provided. A camera may be moved vertically on a track. Drawings are placed on a large table for filming, with centres under the lens. Fixed lights illuminate the copy. These cameras are often over '''4''' metres (10&amp;nbsp;feet) high. These cameras accept roll film stock of 35 or 16&amp;nbsp;mm.

For office documents a similar design may be used but bench standing. This is a smaller version of the camera described above. These are provided either with the choice of 16 or 35&amp;nbsp;mm film or accepting 16&amp;nbsp;mm film only. Non adjustable versions of the office camera are provided. These have a rigid frame or an enveloping box that holds a camera at a fixed position over a copy board. If this is to work at more than one reduction ratio there are a choice of lenses.

Some cameras expose a pattern of light, referred to as blips, to digitally identify each adjacent frame. This pattern is copied whenever the film is copied for searching.

;Flow roll film cameras
A camera is built into a box. In some versions this is for bench top use, other versions are portable. The operator maintains a stack of material to be filmed in a tray, the camera automatically takes one document after another for advancement through the machine. The camera lens sees the documents as they pass a slot. Film behind the lens advances exactly with the image.

Special purpose flow cameras film both sides of documents, putting both images side by side on 16&amp;nbsp;mm film. These cameras are used to record cheques and betting slips.

;Microfiche camera
All microfiche cameras are planetary with a step and repeat mechanism to advance the film after each exposure. The simpler versions use a dark slide loaded by the operator in a dark room; after exposure the film is individually processed, which may be by hand or using a dental X-ray processor. Cameras for high output are loaded with a roll of 105&amp;nbsp;mm film. The exposed film is developed as a roll; this is sometimes cut to individual fiche after processing or kept in roll form for duplication.

;Computer Output Microfilm
[[File:COM card.JPG|left|thumb|Computer Output Microfilm card]]
Equipment is available that accepts a data stream from a mainframe computer. This exposes film to produce images as if the stream had been sent to a line printer and the listing had been microfilmed. Because of the source one run may represent many thousands of pages.

Within the equipment character images are made by a light source; this is the negative of text on paper. COM is sometimes processed normally. Other applications require that image appears as a conventional negative; the film is then reversal processed. This outputs either 16&amp;nbsp;mm film or fiche pages on a 105&amp;nbsp;mm roll.

Because listing characters are a simple design, a reduction ratio of 50 gives good quality and puts about 300 pages on a microfiche. A microfilm plotter, sometimes called an aperture card plotter, accepts a stream that might be sent to a computer pen plotter. It produces corresponding frames of microfilm. These produce microfilm as 35 or 16&amp;nbsp;mm film or aperture cards.

==Duplication==
All regular microfilm copying involves contact exposure under pressure. Then the film is [[Photographic processing|processed]] to provide a permanent image. Hand copying of a single fiche or aperture card involves [[Contact print|exposure]] over a light box and then individually processing the film. Roll films are contact exposed via motor, either round a glass cylinder or through a vacuum, under a controlled light source.  Processing may be in the same machine or separately.

[[Silver halide]] film is a slow version of camera film with a robust top coat. It is suitable for prints or for use as an intermediate from which further prints may be produced. The result is a negative copy.  Preservation standards require a master negative, a duplicate negative, and a service copy (positive).  Master negatives are kept in deep storage, and duplicate negatives are used to create service copies, which are the copies available to researchers.  This multi-generational structure ensures the preservation of the master negative.

[[Diazo dye|Diazo]]-sensitised film for dye coupling in [[ammonia]] gives blue or black dye positive copies. The black image film can be used for further copying.

Vesicular film is sensitised with a diazo dye, which after exposure is developed by heat. Where light has come to the film remains clear, in the areas under the dark image the diazo compound is destroyed quickly, releasing millions of minute bubbles of nitrogen into the film. This produces an image that diffuses light. It produces a good black appearance in a reader, but it cannot be used for further copying.

Modern microfilming standards require that a master set of films be produced and set aside for safe storage, used only to make service copies.  When service copies get lost or damaged, another set can be produced from the masters, thus reducing the image degradation that results from making copies of copies.

==Format conversion==
These conversions may be applied to camera output or to release copies. Single microfiche are cut from rolls of 105&amp;nbsp;mm film. A bench top device is available that enables an operator to cut exposed frames of roll film and fit these into ready made aperture cards.

Transparent jackets are made A5 size each with 6 pockets into which strips of 16&amp;nbsp;mm film may be inserted (or fewer pockets for 35&amp;nbsp;mm strips), so creating microfiche jackets or jacketed microfiche. Equipment allows an operator to insert strips from a roll of film. This is particularly useful as frames may be added to a fiche at any time. The pockets are made using a thin film so that duplicates may be made from the assembled fiche.

==Digital conversion==
Another type of conversion is microform to digital. This is done using an [[Image scanner|optical scanner]] that projects the film onto a [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] array and captures it in a raw digital format. Until recently{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}}, since the different types of microform are dissimilar in shape and size, the scanners were usually able to handle only one type of microform at a time. Some scanners offer swappable modules for the different microform types, and the latest viewer/scanner can accept any microform (roll, fiche, opaque cards, fiche, or aperture cards). [[Software]] (normally on the scanner itself, but more recently in an attached PC) is then used to convert the raw capture into a standard image format for archival.

The physical condition of microfilm greatly impacts the quality of the digitized copy.  Microfilm with a cellulose acetate base (popular through the 1970s) is frequently subject to [[vinegar syndrome]], redox blemishes, and tears, and even preservation standard [[silver halide]] film on a [[polyester]] base can be subject to silvering and degradation of the emulsion—all issues which affect the quality of the scanned image.

Digitizing microfilm can be inexpensive when automated scanners are employed.  The Utah Digital Newspapers Program has found that, with automated equipment, scanning can be performed at $0.15 per page.&lt;ref name="Arlitsch-Herbert"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Arlitsch, Kenning |author2=Herbert, John |title=Microfilm, Paper, and OCR: Issues in Newspaper Digitization |journal=Microform &amp; Imaging Review |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=59–67 |date=Spring 2004 |doi=10.1515/mfir.2004.59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent additions to the digital scanner field have brought the cost of scanning down substantially so that when large projects are scanned (millions of pages) the price per scan can be pennies.

Modern microform scanners utilize 8 bit gray shade scanning arrays and are thus able to provide quite high quality scans in a wealth of different digital formats: CCITT Group IV which is compressed black &amp; white -bitonal, JPG or JPEG which is gray or color compression, bitmaps which are not compressed, or a number of other formats such as PDF, LZW, GIF, etc.  These modern scanners are also able to scan at "Archival" resolution up to 600 dpi.

For the resulting files to be useful, they must be organized in some way. This can be accomplished in a variety of different ways, dependent on the source media and the desired usage. In this regard, [[Punched card#Card formats|aperture cards]] with Hollerith information are probably the easiest since image data can be extracted from the card itself if the scanner supports it. Often, the digital image produced is better than the visual quality available prescan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bryant|first1=Joe|title=Aperture Card Scanning|url=http://www.microcomseattle.com/solutions/document-scanning/aperture-card/|website=Micro Com Seattle|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of microfilm will contain a counter next to the images; these can be referenced to an already existing [[database]]. Other microfilm reels will have a 'blip' system: small marks next to the images of varying lengths used to indicate document hierarchy (longest: root, long: branch, short: leaf). If the scanner is able to capture and process these then the image files can be arranged in the same manner. [[Optical character recognition]] (OCR) is also frequently employed to provide automated full-text searchable files. Common issues that affect the accuracy of OCR applied to scanned images of microfilm include unusual fonts, faded printing, shaded backgrounds, fragmented letters, skewed text, curved lines and bleed through on the originals.&lt;ref name="Arlitsch-Herbert" /&gt; For film types with no distinguishing marks, or when OCR is impossible (handwriting, layout issues, degraded text), the data must be entered in manually, a very time-consuming process.

{{no footnotes|date=June 2014}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Monogatari'''''|物語||}} is a [[Genre|literary form]] in traditional [[Japanese literature]], an extended prose [[narrative]] tale comparable to the [[epic poetry|epic]]. Monogatari is closely tied to aspects of the [[oral tradition]], and almost always relates a [[fiction]]al or fictionalized story, even when retelling a historical event. Many of the great works of Japanese fiction, such as the ''[[Genji monogatari]]'' and the ''[[Heike monogatari]]'', are in this ''monogatari'' form.

The form was prominent around the 9th to 15th centuries, reaching a peak between the 10th and 11th centuries. According to the ''[[Fūyō Wakashū]]'' (1271), at least 198 ''monogatari'' existed by the 13th century. Of these, around forty still exist.

==Influence==
When European and other foreign literature later became known to Japan, the word "monogatari" began to be used in Japanese titles of foreign works of a similar nature. For example, ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'' is known as ''Nito Monogatari'' ({{lang|ja|二都物語}}), ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' as ''Sen'ichiya Monogatari'' ({{lang|ja|千一夜物語}}) and more recently ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as ''Yubiwa Monogatari'' ({{lang|ja|指輪物語}}) and ''[[To Kill a Mockingbird]]'' as ''Arabama Monogatari'' ({{lang|ja|アラバマ物語}}).

'''Nut art''' was an artistic consciousness movement centered in northern California that flourished primarily in the late 60s and early 70s.

The term "Nut art" was coined by artist [[Roy De Forest]] (in conversation with writer David Zack) to describe an approach to art making which embraced humor along with the phantasmagorical. According to De Forest, Nut artists sought to create fantasy worlds reflective of their own quirks and eccentricities. As such, Nut art placed a high degree of emphasis on evolving visions, of which specific artworks were produced as part of the ongoing process of self-definition, or in service to creating new personas and personal mythologies.&lt;ref name=Daniels&gt;{{cite book|last=Linhares|first=Diana L. Daniels ; with essays by Philip E.|title=Clayton Bailey's world of wonders|year=2011|publisher=Crocker Art Museum|location=Sacramento, CA|isbn=978-1-8840-3822-8|pages=8, 24|author2=Frank, Patrick }}&lt;/ref&gt;(Among these personas was that of Ralph "Doggy" Dinsmore, which was used by De Forest.)

As with [[Conceptual art]], the idea or underlying concept with Nut art was paramount. As a result, the creation of the Nut artist was not restricted by style or medium, allowing the movement to embrace emerging formats such as performance, text pieces, and appropriation, in addition to more traditional two and three dimensional mediums such as drawing, photography, and sculpture. Because of the emphasis on concept and satire, Nut art welcomed contributions from participants without formal artistic backgrounds as well as those with advanced technical skill and training. Nut art also reflected the importance of process over product, which had been a central tenet of the Action painters a generation previous.

Besides De Forest, other key practitioners of Nut art included [[Robert Arneson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fineberg|first=Jonathan|title=A troublesome subject : the art of Robert Arneson|year=2013|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-27383-2|page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clayton Bailey]] (as well as Bailey's alter-ego Dr. Gladstone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albright|first=Thomas|title=Art in the San Francisco Bay area, 1945-1980 : an illustrated history|year=1985|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0-520-05193-9|pages=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Victor Cicansky (alter-ego Victor Ceramski), Robert Cumming, [[Lowell Darling]], Jack Ford, [[David Gilhooly]], Jerry Gooch, Linda Renner, [[Peter Saul]], Harold Schlotzhauer, Richard Shaw, Irv Tepper, Chris Unterseher, Peter VandenBerge, Franklin Williams, Maija Zack (alter-ego Maija Woof), and David Zack.&lt;ref name=DePaoli /&gt;

David Zack, who was also a poet and art critic, reviewed many of the group's exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Daniels /&gt; Zack also participated in the movement as an exhibiting artist.

The first major exhibition of Nut art took place in 1972 at the University Art Gallery of [[California State University, Hayward]]. The show was co-curated by Clayton Bailey  (then art faculty) and Gallery Director Irene Keil.&lt;ref name=DePaoli&gt;{{cite book|last=DePaoli |first=G.

'''Osman Kavala''' (born 1957 in [[Paris]]) is a Turkish businessman and philanthropist.

== Life ==
Kavala attended [[Robert College]] in Istanbul and studied [[Economics]] at the [[University of Manchester]]. In 1982, after his father's death, he took over the family-owned enterprise ''Kavala Companies''.&lt;ref&gt;International Peace and Reconciliation Initiative (IPRI): [http://ipr-initiative.com/staff/osman-kavala/ „Osman Kavala, Founder/Partner“].&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2002, he has spent much time working for the charitable foundation ''Anadolu Kültür,'' of which he is the chair. ''Anadolu Kültür'' runs cultural centers in underdeveloped regions of Turkey and fosters cultural cooperation with countries of the [[European Union]].

Kavala is also known to be a sponsor of [[Amnesty International]]. On October 18, 2017 he was arrested without charge when he returned from [[Gaziantep]] (where he had met staff of the [[Goethe-Institut]]) to [[Istanbul Atatürk Airport]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/11/turkey-mysterious-one-year-imprisonment-of-osman-kavala.html|title=Still no charges for Turkey's top philanthropist after year behind bars|last=Gursel|first=Kadri|date=2018-11-05|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some days after that, the newspaper ''[[Daily Sabah]]'', close to the Erdogan government, accused him of being a "business tycoon with a shady background" and having contacts to the "Gülenist Terror Group" ([[FETÖ]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dailysabah.com/investigations/2017/10/25/detained-tycoon-osman-kavala-linked-to-feto-coup-attempts „Detained tycoon Osman Kavala linked to FETÖ coup attempts“], ''[[Daily Sabah]]'' 25 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; President Recep Tayyip Erdogan singled Kavala out for criticism, saying “The connections of the person they call the ‘red Soros of Turkey’ are coming to light”, and accused Kavala of being responsible for the Gezi Park protests, and of the "transfer of significant funds to certain places".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

German politician [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit]], in a public letter to Osman Kavala on 29 March 2018, wrote "I try to understand the reason behind your arrest, but I cannot apprehend it. (...) It is difficult to conceive the reason behind it. (...) I am convinced that democracy will triumph, and we will soon be able to toast to our common future by the Bosporus. I am waiting for you in Frankfurt".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osmankavala.org/en/from-the-media/361-a-letter-from-daniel-cohn-bendit-to-osman-kavala-i-am-waiting-for-you-in-frankfurt ''A letter from Daniel Cohn-Bendit to Osman Kavala: I am waiting for you in Frankfurt''], [[Cumhuriyet]], 29 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kavala's wife is professor of economics.&lt;ref&gt;sueddeutsche.de 12. November 2017 / Christiane Schlötzer: [http://www.sueddeutsche.de/1.3745968 ''Osman Kavala, der "Soros der Türkei" '']&lt;/ref&gt;

As of November 2018, the prosecution has yet to file a criminal indictment against Kavala after more than a year of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/10/lawyers-demand-release-osman-kavala.html|title=Lawyers demand freedom for Turkey's Osman Kavala after year in prison|date=2018-10-31|work=Al-Monitor|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/oct/21/turkey-human-rights-abuses-journalist-shocking-jamal-khashoggi-osman-kavala|title=Turkey should look to its own brutal treatment of journalists {{!}} Kenan Malik|last=Malik|first=Kenan|date=2018-10-21|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ahvalnews.com/echr/jailed-activist-kavala-priority-case-echr|title=Jailed activist Kavala a priority case for ECHR {{!}} Ahval|work=Ahval|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Queens Park Arts Centre is based in a former [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] [[primary school]] and receives no funding from [[local government]]. It is the largest independent arts centre in the United Kingdom.{{cn|date=June 2015}} It was established in 1980 and was first directed by Malcolm Thackwray through funding by Buckinghamshire County Council. In 1998, the Centre became an independent company when its government funding was withdrawn. £325,000 was raised to purchase the freehold to the site, which was secured in 2009. Since then in excess of £200,000 has been raised to refurbish and restore the building.&lt;ref name=History/&gt;

'''''Rejtan, or the Fall of Poland''''' ({{lang-pl|Rejtan. Upadek Polski}}) is an [[oil painting]] by the [[Poles|Polish]] artist [[Jan Matejko]], finished in 1866, depicting the protest of [[Tadeusz Rejtan]] (''lower right'') against the [[First Partition of Poland]] during the [[Partition Sejm]] of 1773.  Both a depiction of a historical moment, and an [[allegory]] for the surrounding period of [[Polish history]], the painting is one of Matejko's most famous works, and an iconic picture of an emotional protest.&lt;ref name="FoundationJaworska1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt;

==Historical context==
[[Tadeusz Rejtan]] was a deputy in the [[Sejm]] (parliament) of the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1773, infamously known as the [[Partition Sejm]].&lt;ref name="Cummins1993"/&gt; The Sejm convened to review the demands of the Commonwealth's three neighbours (the [[Russian Empire]], [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]]) in order to legalize their territorial demands, known as the [[First Partition of Poland]].&lt;ref name="Corwin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smoleński1919"/&gt; The Sejm operated under duress, with the immediate threat of foreign forces present in the Commonwealth, and with a significant number of deputies either bribed or threatened by foreign diplomats.&lt;ref name="Corwin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smoleński1919"/&gt; The three powers officially justified their actions as a compensation for dealing with a troublesome neighbor and restoring order through military intervention in the civil war (the [[War of Bar Confederation]]); in fact all three were interested in territorial gains.&lt;ref name="conquest"/&gt;

On 21 April that year, Rejtan, in a dramatic gesture at the Sejm, is said to have bared his chest and laid himself down in a doorway, blocking the way with his own body in a dramatic attempt to stop the other members from leaving the chamber where the debate was being held. Leaving of the chamber would have signified an end to the discussion, and the acceptance of the motion, meaning the acceptance of foreign territorial demands.&lt;ref name="Cummins1993"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jm"/&gt;

==Scene description==
The painting portrays this scene, although as usual with Matejko's work, it sacrifices some historical reality for more dramatic presentation.&lt;ref name="odk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; It serves as an [[allegory]] for all three [[Partitions of Poland]] (1772, 1793, 1795) and portrays a number of major historical figures of this era.&lt;ref name=odk/&gt;&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Rejtan is the most visible, occupying the entire right side of the painting, in the midst of his dramatic pose which has been compared to ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]''.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; His position on this painting exemplifies the [[golden ratio]].&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;

To his left, in the center, are the "traitors", many of them on the Russian payroll, and future members of the [[Targowica Confederation]]. [[Adam Poniński (1732-1798)|Adam Poniński]], [[marshal of the Sejm]], pointing in red court dress, either demands that Rejtan leaves or points to the armed Russian guards outside the door; he holds a simple wooden walking stick instead of a  more elaborate marshall's staff, which Rejtan stole a day earlier.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Behind him are bishop [[Ignacy Massalski]] and Prince [[Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; To his right, Hetman [[Franciszek Ksawery Branicki]] hides his face in his hands; which likely was Matejko's solution for a prosaic problem — he probably did not have access to a likeness of Branicki. [[Szczęsny Potocki]], with the blue sash, looks to the ground, embarrassed. Behind the overturned chair, his father, [[Franciszek Salezy Potocki]], also embarrassed, drops a quill pen and looks away.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Between the two Potockis [[Jacek Małachowski]] is engaged in discussion with [[Samuel Korsak]],&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1962"/&gt; while [[Karol Stanisław "Panie Kochanku" Radziwiłł|Karol Radziwiłł]] simply observes the situation, amused.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; On the ground, turned over, lies an amchair, with Branicki's hat and a coin purse, from which the coins spill towards Poniński, alluding to the real reason he is intent on concluding the debate.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jędruch1982"/&gt;

To the left of the elder Potocki, the seated [[primate of Poland]], [[Michał Jerzy Poniatowski]], is engaged in a conversation with the chancellor [[Michał Fryderyk Czartoryski]], both ignoring the disruption.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Behind them in the blue waistcoat, King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], annoyed, stands up from the throne, wanting to leave, and looking at his pocket watch.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;

From the gallery, the scene is observed by one of the main architects of the partitions, [[Ambassadors and envoys from Russia to Poland (1763–1794)|Russian ambassador]] [[Nicholas Repnin]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; He is seated between two ladies, likely [[Izabela Lubomirska]] and either [[Elżbieta Grabowska]] or [[Izabela Czartoryska]].&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; To his right, another important symbol is shown in the painting of Russian Tsarina [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine of Russia]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Finally, in the open doors, behind Rejtan, stands a Russian soldier (although in reality the Sejm was "guarded" not by Russian, but by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] troops).&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;

The only person clearly sympathetic to Rejtan is a young man in the middle of the room, holding in his hands a saber and a [[rogatywka]], symbolizing the supporters of the anti-Russian [[Bar Confederation]], and future insurgents from the [[Polish Uprisings]] in the [[Russian partition]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;

==History, reception and significance==
Matejko began work on this painting in August 1864 and finished it in November 1866.&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt; It was one of many paintings portraying key historical moments in the [[history of Poland]] that he would create over his life.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Matejko however did not simply illustrate the history, he intended his paintings to have powerful educational and emotional values.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morawińska1984"/&gt;

The work caused a scandal in contemporary, still-partitioned Poland; it was discussed even before its unveiling.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; It offended a number of society figures, many tracing direct lineage to the major [[magnates of Poland and Lithuania|magnate]] families whose members are portrayed in the painting as traitors to the Polish cause.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; There were a number of critical reviews of the work in the contemporary press, Matejko received anonymous threats, and some aristocrats are said to have considered buying the painting only to destroy it.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Some accused him of defeatism, pessimism, exploiting public sentiment over a historical scandal for contemporary publicity; it was thus criticized by notable artists such as [[Józef Ignacy Kraszewski]] and [[Cyprian Norwid]].&lt;ref name="am"/&gt;&lt;ref name=dekada/&gt; In Paris, a French-Polish aristocrat, [[Count Alexandre Joseph Colonna-Walewski]], campaigned against including it in an exhibition.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; The painting, however, quickly garnered supporters, who in turn reproduced modified copies of it, replacing historical figures with major contemporary critics.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Responding to the public outcry, Matejko painted a response — a painting titled ''[[Judgement on Matejko]]'' (''Wyrok na Matejkę'', 1867), in which he portrayed his execution by some of his most vocal critics.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dekada"/&gt;

Serious art critics had less emotional, but also mixed, opinions of the work.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; It was received less favourably by [[Józef Szujski]] and [[Stanisław Tarnowski]], but praised by painters [[Henryk Siemiradzki]] and [[Artur Grottger]].&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Comments of [[Wojciech Korneli Stattler]] are interpreted by different authors as either praise,&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; or critique.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; In Paris, displayed at ''[[International Exposition (1867)|Exposition Universelle]]'', 1867 the painting received a gold medal.&lt;ref name=dekada/&gt; While in Poland the painting's context and message was clearly understood, the work, displayed in Paris, proved to be too obscure for the audience there, with few understanding the complex, historical context; some French critics interpreted it as a painting of a gambling hall.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; It is said, however, to have been well understood by the Russian visitors to the French gallery, some of whom are said to have been interested in acquiring the painting, which was commended by Poles as "they bought the real ones, might as well buy the painted ones, too".&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt; Eventually, however, the painting was acquired by Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] for 50,000 franks.&lt;ref name="stanedu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt; It was shown at a gallery in Vienna, and eventually ended up at the [[Imperial Natural History Museum|Hofmuseum]].&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt; Thanks to the efforts of minister [[Juliusz Twardowski]] it was purchased by the government of the [[Second Polish Republic]] in 1920.&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bartelik2005"/&gt; As part of the [[Wawel Royal Castle National Art Collection]] it has been on a public display in the [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]] since 1931, with the exception of the period of [[World War II]], when it was briefly [[Nazi looting|looted by the Nazis]].&lt;ref name="Matejko1993-1963"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ks"/&gt;

The painting is usually interpreted as criticism of the Russian interference in Polish political affairs, and the collaboration of treasonous Polish aristocrats.&lt;ref name="Mendelsohn2002"/&gt; By the end of [[World War I]] it was already seen as a priceless artifact of Polish culture.&lt;ref name="Bartelik2005"/&gt; The painting was positively interpreted in [[communist Poland]] as a symbol of critique of the Polish nobility, blamed for their selfishness leading to the partitions.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; More recently, the painting has been interpreted as the symbol of solitary protest, and a moral justification of dissent, even when such a protest is known to be futile, ignored by most.&lt;ref name="am"/&gt; It has also been described as an iconic picture of an emotional protest&lt;ref name="LukowskiZawadzki2006"/&gt; and a symbol of desperate, patriotic protest.&lt;ref name="Uhlig1989"/&gt; In the 1980s the painting inspired a [[protest song]] by [[Jacek Kaczmarski]].&lt;ref name="kaczmarski"/&gt; Over time, the painting has become famous in Poland; Walter M. Cummins notes that the scene from this work was "made familiar to every Polish child by [this] frequently reproduced painting".&lt;ref name="Cummins1993"/&gt;

'''Saint Martin's School of Art''' was an [[art school|art college]] in London, England. It offered foundation and degree level courses. It was established in 1854, initially under the aegis of the church of [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]]. Saint Martin's became part of the [[London Institute]] in 1986,&lt;ref name=hist/&gt; and in 1989 merged with the [[Central School of Art and Design]] to form [[Central Saint Martins College of Arts and Design]].&lt;ref name=frieze/&gt;

==History==
Saint Martin's School of Art was established in 1854 by [[Henry Mackenzie (bishop)|Henry Mackenzie]], [[vicar]] of the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. It became independent from the church in 1859.&lt;ref name=oxford/&gt; 

The school was at first housed on the top floor of [[St Martin's Northern School]] in Shelton Street (then called Castle Street), to the north of [[Long Acre, London|Long Acre]].&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt;

The Gilbert-Garret Competition for Sketching Clubs was founded at Saint Martin's in 1870, when John Parker was headmaster. It was named after [[John Gilbert (painter)|Sir John Gilbert]], the first president of the school.&lt;ref name=gilbert&gt;[s.n.] (1904-1905). [http://chestofbooks.com/crafts/general/Arts-And-Crafts-Magazine/Art-School-Exhibitions-2.html#.UfzxAOBEBID Art School Exhibitions]. ''Arts and Crafts: a monthly practical magazine for the studio, the workshop &amp; the home''. '''1–2'''. UIN: BLL01002839292. (unpaginated online text). Accessed August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1952 to 1979 [[Frank Martin (sculptor)|Frank Martin]] was head of the [[sculpture]] department of Saint Martin's. He brought in young sculptors such as [[Anthony Caro]], [[Robert Clatworthy (sculptor)|Robert Clatworthy]], [[Elizabeth Frink]] and [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] to teach, and also employed as part-time teachers recent graduates of the department, including David Annesley, Michael Bolus, [[Phillip King (artist)|Phillip King]], [[Tim Scott (artist)|Tim Scott]], Bill Tucker and [[Isaac Witkin]].&lt;ref name=frieze/&gt;&lt;ref name=poussin/&gt;&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt; Caro's influence was particularly strong, and the group around him came to be known as the New Generation of British sculptors. The sculpture department became, in the words of Tim Scott: "the most famous in the art world".&lt;ref name=mclean/&gt;

The first public performance of the [[Sex Pistols]] took place at the school on 6 November 1975; they were the support band for a group called [[Bazooka Joe (band)|Bazooka Joe]].&lt;ref name=sharp/&gt;

'''Scholastic Corporation''' is an American multinational publishing, education and media company known for publishing, selling, and distributing books and educational materials for schools, teachers, parents, and children.  Products are distributed to schools and districts, to consumers through the schools via [[Book discussion club|reading clubs]] and fairs, and through retail stores and online sales. The business has three segments: Children Book Publishing &amp; Distribution (Trade, Book Clubs and Book Fairs), Education, and International. Scholastic holds the perpetual US publishing rights to the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' and ''[[The Hunger Games|Hunger Games]]'' book series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/19/us-scholastic-results-idUSBRE86I0PE20120719?type=companyNews |title=Scholastic profit rises on Hunger Games sales &amp;#124; Reuters|work=reuters.com|accessdate=18 October 2012|date=2012-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/07/31/books-harrypotter-bookclub-idUSL2E8IV8FI20120731?type=companyNews |title=J.K. Rowling launches Harry Potter book club online &amp;#124; Reuters|work=reuters.com|accessdate=18 October 2012|first=Patricia|last=Reaney|date=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholastic is the world's largest publisher and distributor of children's books and a leader in print and digital educational materials for pre-K to grade 12.

In addition to ''Harry Potter'' and ''The Hunger Games'', the company is known for its school book clubs and book fairs, classroom magazines such as ''Scholastic News'', and popular book series: ''[[Clifford the Big Red Dog]]'', ''[[Goosebumps]]'', ''[[The Magic School Bus]]'', ''[[Captain Underpants]]'', ''[[Animorphs]]'', and ''[[I Spy (Scholastic)|I Spy]]''. Scholastic also publishes instructional reading and writing programs, and offers professional learning and consultancy services for school improvement. Clifford the Big Red Dog serves as the mascot for Scholastic.

==History==
In 1920, Maurice R. "Robbie" Robinson founded the business he named Scholastic Publishing Company in his hometown of [[Wilkinsburg]], right outside [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. As a publisher of youth magazines, the first publication was ''The Western Pennsylvania Scholastic.'' It covered high school sports and social activities and debuted on October 22, 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/aboutscholastic/peoplehistory.htm |title=About Scholastic People And History |publisher=Scholastic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Scholastic published its first book, ''Saplings'', a collection of selected student writings by winners of the Scholastic Writing Awards.

For many years the company continued its focus on serving the youth market, publishing low-cost magazines and later paperback books. The company continued under the name Scholastic Magazines throughout the 1970s.

After World War II, cheap paperback books became available. In 1948, Scholastic entered the school book club business with its division T.A.B., or Teen Age Book Club, offering classic titles priced at 25 [[US$|cents]].

In 1957, Scholastic established its first international subsidiary in Toronto [[Scholastic Canada]], later moving to [[Markham, Ontario]].

By the 1960s, international publishing locations were added in England (1964), New Zealand (1964) and Sydney (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.shareholder.com/sec/viewerContent.aspx?companyid=ABEA-28S6DN&amp;docid=1973771 |website= |title=United States Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K Annual Report pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities exchange Act of 1934 For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2002 Commission File No. 0-19860: Scholastic Corporation |pages=6, 7 |date=2002 |publisher= |accessdate=12 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, Richard "Dick" Robinson, the son of founder M. R. Robinson, became president of Scholastic Inc. Named chief executive officer in 1975 and chairman in 1982, he remains in these positions.

During the 1970s, Scholastic was well known for Scholastic Book Clubs, a book purchasing service delivered through schools, and magazine publications aimed at youths: ''Wow'' (preschoolers and elementary schoolers), ''[[Dynamite (magazine)|Dynamite]]'' (pre-teens), and ''Bananas'' (teens). Scholastic now publishes 33 classroom magazines including ''Scholastic News'', ''Action'', ''Scope'', ''[[Storyworks]]'', ''SuperScience'', ''Science World'', ''Math'' and more, that reach 14 million readers.

The Scholastic Education business sells instructional reading and writing programs such as Guided and leveled reading and print and digital classroom magazines, along with professional learning programs and consulting/training on Family &amp; Community Engagement and Learning Supports. Classroom Magazines have 15 million subscribers.

During the mid-1990s, Scholastic entered the educational technology market, working with Dr. Ted Hasselbring of Vanderbilt University to create READ 180, a blended-learning, reading intervention program for students in grades 4 through 12 who are two or more grades below grade level.  Since then, READ 180 has been listed in the What Works Clearinghouse and has a record of positive results in a wide range of efficacy studies with various student populations, including special education students and English language learners.  Scholastic Education has since created SYSTEM 44, a technology-based phonics program for students in grades 3 through 12, iREAD, a supplemental educational technology program for grades K-2, MATH 180, mathematics intervention for middle school, and FasttMath, a technology based program to teach basic math facts.  The EdTech and Services business was sold to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2015 for $575 million.

To appeal to American children, in 1997, Scholastic (through [[Arthur A. Levine Books]]) purchased the US publication rights to the first ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', which was renamed ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone''. It continues to publish ''Harry Potter'' books, each title a best seller.

Scholastic's growth has continued by acquiring other media companies. In February 2012, it bought [[Weekly Reader Publishing]] from [[Reader's Digest Association]], and announced in July that year that it planned to discontinue separate issues of ''[[Weekly Reader]]'' magazines after more than a century of publication, and co-branded the magazines as "Scholastic News/Weekly Reader".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-07-23/scholastic-to-end-independent-publication-of-weekly-reader.html |title=Scholastic to End Independent Publication of Weekly Reader – Bloomberg |work=bloomberg.com|accessdate=16 November 2012 |date=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other acquisitions include [[Klutz Press|Klutz]] in 2002,   and the reference publisher [[Grolier]], which publishes the ''[[Grolier Multimedia Encyclopedia]]'' and ''[[The New Book of Knowledge]]'' in 2000 and [[Weston Woods Studios]] in 1996. In 2015, Scholastic acquired Troubadour, Ltd. in the U.K.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], Scholastic organized the [[Scholastic News Kids Press Corps]], which today includes more than 30 national and International kid reporters ages 10–14.

==The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards==
Founded in 1923 by Maurice R. Robinson, [[The Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards]], administered by the [[Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers]], have motivated more than 13 million students, recognized more than 9 million young artists and writers, and provided more than $25 million in awards and scholarships. These Awards have been the largest source of scholarship funding for teenage artists and writers, and the nation's longest-running, most prestigious art and writing awards.

In the U.S.A, the process begins as young artists and writers submit creative works to the Alliance's regional affiliates. The most outstanding works of art and writing (Gold Key and Silver Key winners) from each region are forwarded to the Alliance for Young Artists &amp; Writers in New York City to be reviewed on a national level. Panels of professional jurors select the national award recipients. Regional awards are administered by a network of nearly 100 affiliates that include school systems and school boards, nonprofit organizations, government agencies, foundations, arts agencies, businesses, libraries, museums, teacher councils and institutions of higher education, which share a commitment to identifying emerging local artists and writers.

The Awards recognize written and artistic works in 30 categories, including Architecture, Comic Art, Ceramics &amp; Glass, Digital Art, Design, Drawing, Fashion, Film &amp; Animation, Jewelry, Mixed Media, Painting, Photography, Printmaking, Sculpture, Video Games, Art Portfolio, Photography Portfolio, Dramatic Script, Humor, Journalism, Personal Essay/Memoir, Persuasive Writing, Poetry, Novel Writing, Science Fiction/Fantasy, Short Story, Short, Short Story, General Writing Portfolio, Nonfiction Portfolio, and Creativity &amp; Citizenship.

Recipients of The Scholastic Art and Writing Awards include [[Richard Anuszkiewicz]], [[Richard Avedon]], [[Harry Bertoia]], [[Mel Bochner]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Paul Brooks Davis|Paul Davis]], [[Frances Farmer]], [[Red Grooms]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Bernard Malamud]], [[Joyce Maynard]], [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Philip Pearlstein]], [[Peter S. Beagle]], [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Robert Redford]], [[Jean Stafford]], Mozelle Thompson, [[Ned Vizzini]], [[Kay WalkingStick]], [[Andy Warhol]], and [[Charlie White (artist)|Charles White,]] all of whom won when they were in high school.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

== James Patterson Pledge ==
In March 2018, author [[James Patterson]] announced an increase in his annual donations for classroom libraries from $1.75 million to $2 million, in a program run in conjunction with the Scholastic Book Clubs. Patterson is also distributing 4,000 gifts of $500 each to teachers around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/mar/19/james-patterson-donating-2-million-to-classroom-li/|title=James Patterson donating $2 million to classroom libraries|work=Spokesman.com|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Book clubs==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2014}}
Scholastic [[Book sales club|book clubs]] are offered at schools in many countries. Typically, teachers administer the program to the students in their own classes, but in some cases, the program is administered by a central contact for the entire school. Within Scholastic, Reading Clubs is a separate unit (compared to, e.g., Education). Reading clubs are arranged by age/grade.

Scholastic also offers a host of specialty book club fliers including '''Club Leo''' (Spanish language for grades K–8), and '''Click''' (Computer games and media for all ages).

Scholastic typically offers participating schools and classrooms 1 "point" for every dollar (or local unit of currency) of products ordered. Additional points may be earned during special promotion times, such as the beginning of the school year. Points may then be redeemed for books and school supplies at a rate of approximately 20 points to the dollar. At minimum, schools earn 5% of book orders in free products. With special promotions, return rate can be higher (15–100%).

==Scholastic Parents Media==
Scholastic Parents Media publishes the [[Scholastic Parent &amp; Children Magazine]]. The group also specializes in online advertising sales and custom programs designed for parents and children ages 0–6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/parentchild.jsp |title=Parent &amp; Child Magazine |publisher=Scholastic.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Scholastic has been criticized for inappropriately marketing to children. Also, Scholastic now requires parents to submit children's names with birth dates to place online orders, creating controversy. A significant number of titles carried have strong media tie-ins and are considered relatively short in literary and artistic merit by some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2006/11/20/taking_consumerism_out_of_school_book_fairs/ |title='&amp;#39;Boston Globe'&amp;#39; |publisher=Boston.com |date=2006-11-20 |accessdate=2014-03-12 |first=Barbara F. |last=Meltz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumer groups have also attacked Scholastic for selling too many toys and video games to children, rather than focusing on just books. &lt;!--Critics have noted that "lesson plan" books published by Scholastic are too frequently written by authors lacking classroom experience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.topix.com/content/prweb/2010/03/a-new-math-art-activity-book-thats-actually-written-by-a-teacher-4&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; 
In July, 2005, Scholastic determined that certain leases previously accounted for as operating leases should have been accounted for as capital leases. The cumulative effect, if recorded in the current year, would be material. As a result, it decided to restate its financial statements.

The taking of the idea for such a mechanism is the origin of the concept.]]
'''Stealing thunder''' is to take someone else's idea, using it for one's own advantage or to pre-empt the other party.

==Origin==
The idiom comes from the peevish dramatist [[John Dennis (dramatist)|John Dennis]] early in the 18th century, after he had conceived a novel idea for a [[thunder machine]].&lt;ref name=Dent/&gt;  There is an account of it in ''The lives of the poets of Great Britain and Ireland'' by [[Robert Shiels]] and [[Theophilus Cibber]]:&lt;ref name=lives/&gt;{{quote|Mr. Dennis happened once to go to the play, when a tragedy was acted, in which the machinery of thunder was introduced, a new artificial method of producing which he had formerly communicated to the managers. Incensed by this circumstance, he cried out in a transport of resentment, 'That is my thunder by G—d; the villains will play my thunder, but not my plays.'}}

==Rhetorical use==
In a contentious situation, such as a court case, political debate or public relations crisis, it is a tactic used to weaken the force of an adverse point.&lt;ref name=LHB/&gt;  By introducing the point first and being open about it or rebutting it, the force of the opposition's argument is diminished – their thunder is stolen.&lt;ref name=Coombs/&gt;

'''''Sunlight''''' is an [[oil painting]] by [[Frank Weston Benson]] currently in the permanent collection at the [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]].

==Description==
Sunlight is created in the [[American impressionist]] style. It is a portrait of a woman, who has been identified as Benson's daughter, Eleanor, standing on a hill, looking out towards the [[Atlantic Ocean]] off [[Penobscot Bay]] in [[Maine]]. She is in a white dress that is getting ruffled by the wind blowing off the ocean. Her left hand is up, shielding her face from the sun, while her right hand is planted on her hip, a pose Benson used multiple times. Because of the woman shielding her eyes form the sun, it is likely that the [[sunlight]] is the actual subject of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Catalog Entry on Sunlight|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/sunlight-benson-frank-weston|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical information==
Frank W Benson started working with the Impressionist style at the turn of the 20th century,&lt;ref name="Bedford"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bedford|first=Faith Andrews|title=Benson Biography|year=1999|url=http://www.frankwbenson.com/bensonbio.html|accessdate=2 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704183753/http://www.frankwbenson.com/bensonbio.html|archivedate=4 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started exclusively using the style by 1909. Benson was one of the forerunners of American Impressionism, especially within the [[Ten American Painters]]. Benson was known for painting the idealized world, especially that of the leisure of [[New England]].

Benson was, like most Impressionists, very interested in [[light]]. Benson himself stated that, "I follow the light, where it comes from, where it goes."&lt;ref name="Bedford"/&gt;

===Acquisition===
Painted in 1909, the painting was included in the Sixth Annual Exhibition of Works by American Artists, December 4, 1910 - January 1, 1911. It was later purchased from the artist by the John Herron Art Institute, now Indianapolis Museum of Art, in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provenance of Sunlight|publisher=[[Indianapolis Museum of Art]]|url=http://www.imamuseum.org/art/collections/artwork/sunlight-benson-frank-weston#provenance-text|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}
A '''talking animal''' or '''speaking animal''' is any non-human animal that can produce sounds or gestures resembling those of a [[human language]]. Several species or groups of animals have developed [[animal communication|forms of communication]] which superficially resemble verbal language, however, these are not defined as language because they lack one or more of the defining characteristics, i.e. [[grammar]], [[syntax]], [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursion]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]. Researchers have been successful in teaching some animals to make gestures similar to [[sign language]]. However, these animals fail to reach one or more of the criteria accepted as defining language.

== Possibility of animal language ==
[[Image:CleverHans.jpg|thumb|[[Clever Hans]] performing]]

The term refers to animals which can imitate (though not necessarily understand) human speech. [[Parrot]]s, for example, repeat things nonsensically through exposure.{{citation needed|reason=This is not necessarily true|date=July 2015}} It is a form of [[anthropomorphism]] to call this human speech, as it has no [[Semantics|semantic grounding]].

Researchers have attempted to teach [[Great ape language|great apes]] (gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos) spoken language with poor results as they can only be taught how to say one or a few basic or limited words or phrases or less, and sign language with significantly better results as they can be very creative with various [[sign language|hand signals]] like those of [[deaf|deaf people]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  However, even the best communicating great ape has shown an inability to grasp the idea of syntax and grammar, instead communicating at best at the same level as a [[pidgin]] language in humans.  They are expressive and communicative, but lack the formality that remains unique to human speech.

Modern{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} research shows that the key difference is the animal's lack of asking questions and that formal syntax is merely a superficial detail, however Alex the parrot has been recorded as having asked an existential question.&lt;ref name = "jordania"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Asked the First Question? The Origins of Human Choral Singing, Intelligence, Language and Speech | last1 = Jordania | first1=Joseph | isbn = 978-99940-31-81-8 |year = 2006 | publisher = Logos | location = Tbilisi| title-link = Who Asked the First Question? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other differences as well, including poor precision, as shown by Kanzi the bonobo used the lexigram for ''chase'' interchangeably with that for ''get'', though this behavior may not be the same for all animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kluger, J.|title=Inside the minds of animals|year=2010|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2008867,00.html | work=Time | first=Jeffrey | last=Kluger | title=Inside the Minds of Animals | date=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research supports the idea that the linguistic limitations in animals are due to limited general brainpower (as opposed to lack of a specific module),{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and that words are created by breaking down sentences into pieces, making grammar more basic than semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Lacerda: A ecological theory of language acquisition&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reported cases by species ==

=== Birds ===
{{main|Bird vocalisation}} {{main|Talking bird}}

* Research done by Dr. [[Irene Pepperberg]] indicates that parrots are capable of speaking in context and with intentional meaning. One of Pepperberg's parrots, [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], a [[grey parrot]], demonstrated the ability to assemble words out of letters.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Dogs ===
{{main|Dog communication}} {{See also|Hundesprechschule Asra}}

An owner hears a dog making a sound that resembles a phrase says the phrase back to the dog, who then repeats the sound and is rewarded with a treat. Eventually the dog learns a modified version of the  original sound. Dogs have limited vocal imitation skills, so these sounds usually need to be shaped by selective attention and social reward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-dogs-can-talk/| title=Fact or Fiction: Dogs Can Talk |first=Tina | last=Adler | publisher = Scientific American | date = June 10, 2009 | accessdate = February 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A dog on [[America's Funniest Home Videos]] named Fluffy, made noises that to some viewers resembled "I want my momma" after being asked "Do you want your momma?".{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Other videos showed other dogs making noises which to some viewers resembling "Run around", "I want it", "I love momma" and "Hello". 
* Odie, a [[pug]] who produced noises resembling "I love you" on demand, made appearances on several television shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetalkingpug.com/|title=the talking pug|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Paranormal]] researcher [[Charles Fort]] wrote in his book ''[[Wild Talents]]'' (1932) of several alleged cases of dogs that could speak English. Fort took the stories from contemporary newspaper accounts.
*A husky which produces vocalisations that to some viewers sound like 'no' has appeared in the Daily Mail, the Mirror and the Huffington Post, amongst others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2539781/Defiant-husky-Blaze-hates-kennel-learnt-say-no-owner-tries-bed.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Emma | last=Thomas | title=Defiant husky Blaze hates his kennel so much he learnt how to say no | date=January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1715 [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] published an account of his encounter with a talking dog that could pronounce about 30 words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UoaoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=Don+Talking+Dog#v=onepage&amp;q=Leibniz&amp;f=false|title=Amazing Dogs: A Cabinet of Canine Curiosities|first=Jan|last=Bondeson|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|via=Google Books|isbn=9781445609645}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Don, a German pointer born around the beginning of the 20th century, was a dog that was reputed to be able to pronounce a couple of words in German and became a vaudeville sensation as a result. Although most scientists at the time dismissed Don's capabilities, the author [[Jan Bondeson]] puts forward an argument that Don was genuinely capable of limited human speech and criticises the tests that were performed on Don at the time as having serious methodological flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UoaoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=Don+Talking+Dog#v=onepage&amp;q=Don+Talking+Dog&amp;f=false|title=Amazing Dogs: A Cabinet of Canine Curiosities|first=Jan|last=Bondeson|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|via=Google Books|isbn=9781445609645}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1959 a German sheepdog by the name of Corinna living in [[Prague]] spontaneously developed a capability for limited human speech. According to the zoologist Hermann Hartwigg, published under the pseudonym 'Hermann Dembeck', Corinna 'holds the record in modern times for its talking prowess'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=WmUTAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Corinna+Dog+Tuma&amp;dq=Corinna+Dog+Tuma|title=Willingly to school: How animals are taught|publisher=Taplinger Publishing Company |date=2017-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cats === &lt;!-- [[Tiggy (disambiguation)]] links here --&gt;
{{main|Cat communication}}

* The case of a cat that was videotaped speaking purported human words and phrases such as "Oh my dog", "Oh Long John", "[[Oh Long Johnson]]", "Oh Don piano", "Why I eyes ya", and "All the live long day"&lt;ref name="youtube_201203"&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBKVXyrHcw | title=Oh Long Johnson... - talking cat | date=June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; became an [[Internet phenomenon]] in 2006. Footage of this cat, nicknamed Oh Long Johnson from one of the phrases spoken, was featured on ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' in 1998, and a longer version of the clip (which revealed the animal was reacting to the presence of another cat) was aired in the UK. Clips from this video are prevalent on [[YouTube]]. The cat appeared as a character in "[[Faith Hilling]]", the 226th episode of ''[[South Park]]'', which aired on March 28, 2012.
* [[Miles v. City Council of Augusta, Georgia]], in which the court found that the exhibition of a talking cat was considered an occupation for the purposes of municipal licensing law.

{{Neoplatonism}}
'''''The Enneads''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Ἐννεάδες}}), fully '''''The Six Enneads''''', is the collection of writings of [[Plotinus]], edited and compiled by his student [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] ({{c.|{{sc|ad}}}}{{nbsp}}270). Plotinus was a student of [[Ammonius Saccas]] and they were founders of [[Neoplatonism]]. His work, through [[Augustine of Hippo]], the [[Cappadocian Fathers]], [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] and several subsequent Christian and Muslim thinkers, has greatly influenced Western and Near-Eastern thought.

==Contents==
Porphyry edited the writings of Plotinus in fifty-four [[treatise]]s, which vary greatly in length and number of chapters, mostly because he split original texts and joined others together to match this very number. Then, he proceeded to set the fifty-four treatises in groups of nine (Greek. ''ennea'') or ''Enneads''. He also collected ''The Enneads'' into three volumes. The first volume contained the first three ''Enneads'' (I, II, III), the second volume has the ''Fourth'' (IV) and the ''Fifth'' (V) ''Enneads'', and the last volume was devoted to the remaining ''Enneads''. After correcting and naming each treatise, Porphyry wrote a biography of his master, ''Life of Plotinus'', intended to be an Introduction to the ''Enneads''.

Porphyry's edition does not follow the chronological order in which ''Enneads'' were written (see ''Chronological Listing'' below), but responds to a plan of study which leads the learner from subjects related to his own affairs to subjects concerning the uttermost principles of the [[universe]].

Although not exclusively, Porphyry tells us (Cf. ''Life of Plotinus'', chapters.24-26) that the ''First Ennead'' deals with Human or ethical topics, the ''Second and Third Enneads '' are mostly devoted to cosmological subjects or physical reality, the ''Fourth'' concerns the Soul, the ''Fifth'' knowledge and intelligible reality, and finally the ''Sixth'' covers Being and what is above it, the One or first principle of all.

==Citing the ''Enneads''==
Since the publishing of a modern critical edition of the Greek text by P. Henry and H.-R. Schwyzer (''Plotini Opera''. 3 volumes. Paris-Bruxelles, 1951-1973) and the revised one (''Plotini Opera''. 3 volumes. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1964-1984) there is an academic convention of citing the ''Enneads'' by first mentioning the number of ''Ennead'' (usually in Romans from I to VI), the number of treatise within each ''Ennead'' (in arabics from 1 to 9), the number of chapter (in arabics also), and the line(s) in one of the mentioned editions. These numbers are divided by periods, commas, or blank spaces.

E.g. For ''Fourth Ennead'' (IV), treatise number seven (7), chapter two (2), lines one to five (1-5), we write:

* IV.7.2.1-5

E.g. The following three mean ''Third Ennead'' (III), treatise number five (5), chapter nine (9), line eight (8):

* III, 5, 9, 8  
* 3,5,9,8
* III 5 9 8

It is important to remark that some translations or editions do not include the line numbers according to P. Henry and H.-R. Schwyzer's edition. In addition to this, the chronological order of the treatises is numbered between brackets or parentheses, and given below.

E.g.  For the previously given:

* IV.7 (2).2.1-5   since treatise IV.7 was the second written by Plotinus.
* III, 5 [50], 9, 8  since III.5 was the fiftieth written by Plotinus.

==Table of contents==

== Note on the ''Plotiniana Arabica'' or ''Arabic Plotinus''==
After the fall of [[Western Roman Empire]] and during the period of the [[Byzantine]] Empire, the authorship of some Plotinus' texts became clouded.
Many passages of ''Enneads'' IV-VI, now known as ''Plotiniana Arabica'', circulated among [[Islam]]ic scholars (as [[Al-Kindi]], [[Al-Farabi]] and [[Avicenna]]) under the name ''[[The Theology of Aristotle]]'' or quoted as "''Sayings of an old [wise] man''".
The writings had a significant effect on [[Islamic philosophy]], due to Islamic interest in [[Aristotle]]. A Latin version of the so-called ''Theology'' appeared in Europe in 1519. (Cf. O'Meara, ''An Introduction the Enneads''. Oxford: 1995, 111ff.)

They work in collaboration with biologists, ecologists, historians, activists, architects, urban planners and fellow artists to initiate dialogues and create works exploring biodiversity and community development. Helen and Newton Harrison are both Professors Emeriti at University of California, Santa Cruz, and University of California, San Diego. They have had numerous international solo exhibitions, and their work is in the collections of many public institutions, including the [[Pompidou Center]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Nevada Museum of Art]], and the [[Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art]]. In 2013, the Harrisons became the first recipients of the Corlis Benefideo Award for Imaginative Cartography.

== Early life and education ==
Helen Mayer was a gifted student born on July 1, 1927, in New York City in the city's easternmost borough of [[Queens]].  There, her parents worked as schoolteachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Genzlinger|first1=Neil|authorlink1=Neil Genzlinger|title=Helen Mayer Harrison, Leader in Eco-Art Movement, Dies at 90|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/obituaries/helen-mayer-harrison-leader-in-eco-art-movement-dies-at-90.html|accessdate=16 April 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduating from [[Forest Hills High School (New York)|Forest Hills High School]] in 1943 at sixteen years old, she earned a full tuition scholarship to attend [[Cornell University]]. She enrolled at Cornell and majored in Psychology for two years, but ultimately returned home to earn her bachelor's degree in English from [[Queens College, City University of New York|Queens College]] in 1948. She also earned a master's degree in the philosophy of education from [[New York University]] (NYU) in 1952.

Newton Abner Harrison was born on October 20, 1932 in New York City in the borough of [[Brooklyn]] and then raised in the nearby suburb of [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]]. Newton's grandfather Simon W. Farber was an enterprising tinsmith from Russia who immigrated to America in the late 19th century and established a small business for manufacturing kitchen utensils in downtown Manhattan. His initial idea in 1897 was to set up a shop on the Lower East Side to make brassware and ornamental objects for nearby families because it had been customary to import such items up to that time. Business grew slowly and steadily in the first decade until he transitioned from hand hammering to metal spinning with an automated machine lathe, which reduced the cost of labor and dramatically increased both production and sales. In 1907, Farber acquired a manufacturing plant in Brooklyn to further expand his line of cookware and branded the company [[Farberware]]. Newton attended Peddie Prep High School, a college preparatory school in New Jersey, and first expressed interest in becoming an artist at age fifteen. His parents abided, and arranged an apprenticeship for their son with a local sculptor in New Rochelle named [[Michael Lantz]]. Newton continued to assist Lantz in his studio in the off intervals of his schooling during the years 1948 through 1953 with plaster casting, building wood armatures, modeling, woodwork and building architectural scale models, as well as drafting and reading architectural blueprints. He then completed several years of schooling at [[Antioch College]] in Yellow Springs, Ohio before reaffirming to his parents his intention to become a professional artist. In 1952 he transferred to the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] to continue his study of sculpture. Local art collectors praised and encouraged the young artist to develop his Rodin-like approach to the human figure, his ability to convey the poetic motions of the body and soul.&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Catherine Biddle Cadwalader Scull, whom along with her husband Mr. Richard Barclay Scull commissioned Newton to create a rooftop sculpture for their home in the Radnor Township of Villanova, likened Newton's ''Love Groups'' (1957) to the work of Auguste Rodin, citing ''The Kiss'' (1889) as a comparable example of two nudes embracing. See Mrs. Scull quoted in "Nude Statues on Roof Cause Traffic Jam on Main Line" and Thomas Hovenden, "Plastic Nudes in Quaker Land: Ups and Downs of Works Raise Stock of Plymouth Mtg. Sculptor," ''The Times Herald'' (undated) in Scrapbook 1 (1957-1958). Series 7, Early Work by Newton Harrison, Flat Box 290. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Helen and Newton married in 1953. There is a notable collection of letters in the [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8qj7ntt/ Harrison Papers at Stanford] written and received by the Harrisons as a young married couple on their first trip abroad to [[Florence|Florence, Italy]] where they lived for three years, from 1957 to 1960, with partial funding from the Scheidt Memorial Scholarship awarded to Newton by the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the rest financed by Newton's parents Estelle and Harvey Harrison. The Florence letters express the couple's experience coming of age as young Americans living abroad and honing their career ambitions in the postwar era. "Many thanks," begins one letter to Estelle and Harvey, for you both "enable us to find ourselves. The way of the artist is not an easy one, but the rewards for us are many, and the promise of being able to use ourselves significantly according to our capacities is the only promise that holds meaning for us."&lt;ref&gt;"Dearest Mother and Dad, Much Love, Us" (undated). Series 4. Correspondence, Box 121, Folders 2-4. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrisons returned from Florence to the bustling New York City art scene in 1960. Newton initially found work teaching experimental painting to children at housing settlement projects and neighborhood centers. He then enrolled at the [[Yale University]] School of Art and Architecture to complete his bachelor's degree, which he had left unfinished when he and Helen moved to Florence. [https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/08/arts/sewell-sillman-67-artist-and-publisher-is-dead.html Sewell Sillman] and [[Al Held]] were two key mentors for Newton during his time at Yale. He graduated in 1965 at age thirty-two with both a bachelor's and master's degree in fine art, and secured his first faculty position as Assistant Professor in Charge of Visual Fundamentals at the [[University of New Mexico]] (UNM). Now with four school-aged children and her own set of credentials and qualifications, Helen also went back to work at UNM teaching literature and acclimating to the world of higher education. However, she oriented her work in the field of education more broadly, endeavoring to raise the issue of equality and access to good education at every level of society. In 1965, she and Newton collaborated on writing an essay exploring new directions in education for high school dropouts, entitled "Dropouts and a 'Design for Living'," published in the book ''New Perspectives on Poverty''.&lt;ref&gt;Shostak, Arthur B. and William Gomberg, eds. (1965). ''New Perspectives on Poverty''. Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrisons moved to [[La Jolla, California]] in 1967 when the founding chair of the Visual Arts Department at [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]], abstract expressionist painter [[Paul Brach]], offered Newton a faculty position. And for the past fifty years, California has been their home. Helen began collaborating with Newton on the occasion of the "Furs and Feathers" exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts in New York City, experimenting with new approaches to the production as well as display of knowledge in a work called ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' (1970-1971). 1972 is the year that Helen resigned from her director position with UC Extension Division's Education Programs to pursue art full-time. In her resignation letter, she wrote with affection, "I have had too much fun here! However, I am becoming an artist in my old age and I am doing what we have offered a number of Extension courses about - 'switching careers midstream'."&lt;ref&gt;Resignation letter from Helen to Dr. Martin N. Chamberlain, University Extension (August 25, 1972). Series 10, University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Box 178, Folder 1. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; A decade or two later, the Harrisons both became tenured faculty in the Visual Arts Department at UC San Diego and subsequently emeriti faculty in the Art Department at [[UC Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;The "Early Life and Education" segment of this page is adapted from Eliasieh, Laura (née Rogers).

==  Switching Careers Midstream ==
Helen and Newton proceeded along different paths and at different speeds to solidify their career as artists after arriving at UC San Diego in 1967. The relatively unsettled period of critical self-reflection and career development in the 1950s and 1960s is key to appreciating their decision to collaborate with one another beginning in 1970. For even within the UC system, the Harrisons have maintained a reputation as self-critical and inquiry-based learners. They have tirelessly posed questions that challenge institutional norms and advanced a new model of [[artistic research]] that engages with both social and environmental issues.

In 1968, growing concern for equality and social justice initially motivated Helen to matriculate at United States International University (known today as [[Alliant International University]]) to begin an interdisciplinary doctoral program in the Graduate School of Leadership and Human Behavior. Her aim with this second graduate degree was to refresh and synthesize three domains of expertise—language, learning, and social psychology—so that she could contribute research towards ensuring that all students have equal prospects for living well. However, Helen joined UC Extension Division as an education program coordinator in 1969 and after promoting to a director position in 1970 she withdrew from the doctoral program to work directly with young educators seeking guidance in career development. During her tenure as director of UC Extension Division's education programs, enrollment and course offerings rose from an average of forty-two classes to fifty-five classes per quarter. Helen's goal was to provide teachers of [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] with courses to enhance their level of expertise in subject areas, while also providing them with a deeper understanding of psychology and childhood intellectual development. She expanded the reach of UC Extension Division's education programs to more than ten school districts in the county, and she introduced one-day and two-week conferences that drew participants from across the country.

While studying at United States International University, Helen collected writings by the vanguard of the [[Women's Liberation Movement]] including: [[Alice S. Rossi]]'s "Status of Women in Graduate Departments of Sociology: 1968-1969," accepted for publication in ''The American Sociologist'' (Fall 1969) and made available through the Women's Caucus of the American Sociological Association at their San Francisco convention; Beverly Jones and Judith Brown's "Toward a Female Liberation Movement," published by New England Free Press; and [[Naomi Weisstein]]'s "Kinde, Kuche, Kirche as Scientific Law: Psychology Constructs the Female," published by New England Free Press.&lt;ref&gt;"On Women" paper notes (1968-1969). Series 1, Personal/Biographical, Subseries 5, Harrison Family, Box 218, Folder 9. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of second wave feminism, Helen's concern for equality and social justice had grown to include, in a more direct way, her own rights as a woman to use herself significantly according to her own capacities and to be recognized for her contributions. It is this alchemy of ambition and social consciousness that led Helen to begin collaborating with Newton in the conceptualization and making of ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' (1970-1971) at the [[Museum of Contemporary Crafts]] in New York City, and subsequently to resign from UC Extension Division to pursue art full-time. Yet it would take many more years for Helen to be recognized by her peers as fully equal with her collaborator and husband.

Helen actually took the lead in producing ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' for the "Furs and Feathers" exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Crafts. She assembled students from the Visual Arts Department at UC San Diego into a small research team to expand on information that she had requested from the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]] regarding the destruction of natural habitats and resident species that suffer from that destruction; their fleshy bodies subject to the insatiable demands of the world market economy. Her influence is especially apparent in the team's approach to presenting the information in the context of a museum. Artists experimenting with art and technology in the late 1960s, including Newton, had been working with information. They had been using new computer technologies to program sculptures as self-regulating [[Cybernetics|cybernetic]] systems built on the concept of feedback to explore the relationship of machines (perhaps as proxies for humans) to their surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;''Plasma Chambers'' (1969–1971), designed in collaboration with engineers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) as part of the Art and Technology Program at Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), is the most distinguished of Newton’s art and technology projects. Newton began working with a student in the Physics Department at UC San Diego to experiment with glow discharge demonstrations, which show how an electric force introduced to a medium of noble gas plasma will produce colored light—orange in the case of neon gas—in a process called ionization. A neon light is a miniature glow discharge environment. JPL engineers helped Newton design an even larger glow discharge chamber to increase the visibility of ionization, which can form diffuse shapes and patterns. ''Plasma Chambers'' traveled to the 1970 World Exposition in Osaka along with seven other esteemed works from LACMA’s Art and Technology Program before the opening of the official “Art and Technology” exhibition in Los Angeles on May 16, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; Helen's approach was different. She worked with students to produce a [[Rolodex]] (appreciating the simplicity of the rotating desktop card index invented in 1956 by the Danish engineer Hildaur Neilsen) as a sculptural object containing didactic yet poetic descriptions of species extinct, endangered, formerly endangered, and in over supply, and constructed in a way that would permit change as new data became available. She and the students then created a 4'x14' chart visualization of the data contained in the Rolodex to be hung on the wall of the museum gallery, as if a painting, alongside a 14'x14' world map produced by Newton interpreting the Rolodex data as a spatial narrative. It is important to recognize the work that Helen and the students produced for ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' as politically entangled, unspectacular, and strong because of it. The Rolodex invited people to participate in the tactile process of retrieving and making sense of information, rather than stand in awe before an eye-catching digital media display. The chart asserted that people are already equipped to process the gravity of species extinction and take decisive action. "The numbers always change" explained Newton in the exhibition catalog "and research shows that an endangered form can regenerate itself when protection is enforced, and again assume its role in the life cycle."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, Newton (1971). "An Ecological Proposal" in ''Furs and Feathers'', ed. Paul J. Smith. New York: Museum of Contemporary Crafts of the American Crafts Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the "Furs and Feathers" exhibition, [[Richard Elman]] described gazing at "a large white map of the world in the main entranceway that was annotated densely with print, especially the U.S. portion, in tones of red and gray to distinguish 'endangered' from 'exterminated' species of wildlife." Even more impressionable was an accompanying audio recording that Elman recalls as "a litany, a casualty list, intoned in a flat dispirited voice. On and on it went for quite some fifteen minutes about the hunting pursuits of the sheiks of the Arabian peninsula, entire populations of sea birds, monkeys, lions, vincuñas, and the great auk."&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Richard. "Furs and Feathers." ''Craft Horizons'' 31, 2 (April 1971): 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

So why, after many months of working with students to prepare ''An Ecological Nerve Center'' for exhibition, is Helen's name conspicuously absent from the exhibition catalog, Elman's review, and other promotional materials? Neither the curator nor critic acknowledged her contributions. It would take yet more time and dedication, in the wake of second wave feminism, for Helen to come forth as an artist equal to Newton.

Pivotal to the story of Helen solidifying her career as an artist are two solo works through which she arrived at her own avant-garde understanding of participation in growth form and growth activism. ''Strawberry Jam'' (1973), the first solo work, began when Dextra Frankel, Director of the Art Gallery of [[California State University, Fullerton|California State University at Fullerton]], contacted Helen in February 1973 to inquire if she would like to participate as a solo artist in a large group exhibition entitled "In a Bottle." As Helen recalls in a typewritten statement reflecting back on the exhibition: “I had just finished assisting Newton Harrison with a work called ''Strawberry Wall'' and he suggested that I do a performance of making jam, since I did the feasts for his growth works, and I thought—what goes in a bottle but Jam.” On a separate piece of paper, torn from an old notepad of the English Language and Literature Department at the University of New Mexico (where Helen taught from 1965 to 1967), she recorded a [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]] that further elaborates on her creative process: “One of the things to do with a bottle is fill it. One of the basic things to fill a bottle with is food. One makes the food and preserves it in the bottle. Collecting bottles and filling them with food…imagine there is no food for us this year and we have to make next year’s food—Food Wall—give up its yield to other people in a series of feasts—abundance ritual—record it.”&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Materials from ''Strawberry Jam'' at the Woman's Building, Los Angeles, CA (March 23, 1974). Series 5, Performances and Exhibitions, Box 136, Folder 8-9. M1797, Helen and Newton Harrison Papers, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Stanford University.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Strawberry Jam'' thus became an endurance performance in which Helen made fifteen jars of strawberry jam per day for six consecutive days using only natural ingredients like lemon juice and wine to thicken the mixture, and as little sugar as possible to acquaint herself with the sweet flavor of the fruit itself. The recipes varied each day based on the sweetness of the berries plucked from the plants, and the jam became increasingly tart as Helen came to appreciate the way lemon and wine enhanced the acidic undertone of the berries. The initial five days of the performance took place in private. On the sixth day, Helen staged the making of ''Strawberry Jam'' for an audience at the Art Gallery of California State College at Fullerton. And on the seventh day, she rested.

Six months later Helen resumed making strawberry jam as an artistic research project. She had continued ruminating on the conceptual imagery of the bottle and its attendant ideology of preservation. She wondered how the medium of photography would serve as a tool of preservation or perhaps continuity, not of the fruit itself, but of the knowledge and skill required to plant, grow, and harvest strawberries in cycles of regeneration with moments of abundance and scarcity. As a studio experiment, Helen used square wall-mounted shelves to arrange a canvas-like grid composition of jars filled with jam left over from the Fullerton exhibition. She then entreated Philip Steinmetz, a conceptual artist and photographer who in 1971 had joined the Visual Arts Department faculty at UC San Diego, to make two color images: one of abundance with all the jars in place so as to fill the shelves, and one of scarcity with only a few jars in place. She also produced a third and compelling image in which she placed just three jars on top of a short stack of books, including [[Jack Burnham]]’s ''The Structure of Art'', and printed several copies such that she could modify the composition using collage techniques. With collage, Helen could adjust the quantity of jars and stack them in different cumulative formations as a way of reflecting on the merits of growth form and growth activism by women in relation to the so-called structure of art.

''Off Strawberry Wall'' (1974), Helen's second solo work, began when feminist art historian [[Arlene Raven]] invited Helen to participate in the exhibition program at the [[The Women's Building|Women's Building]] of Los Angeles. Helen paired up with Joyce Shaw for a three-week exhibition at Grandview One Gallery inside the Women's Building. The artist statement that she produced for this show further demonstrates the fluidness of her thinking about time, labor, culture, art, preservation, and continuity of life. In this statement, she explained that both strawberry works are “spin-offs and amusements from feasts and performances that I have done in other contexts. I am interested in the relationship between the morphologies and transformations that happen in living and growing and cooking and the transformations that we call art. I am especially interested in those intentional transformations that make objects stand for process. The play of time, nature and artifice is an important element in my work and I am intrigued by the juxtaposition of real growth strawberries, shelf-life for the jam and the instantaneous transformations of the camera and collage.”&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; On the largest wall of Grandview One Gallery, Helen hung the Steinmetz photographs alongside her exploratory collage that questioned the merits of work by women in relation to the structure of art. On an adjacent wall, she installed a low-lying horizontal pasture of strawberry plants in modular container-like forms that Newton had designed for ''Survival Pieces''. But the closing of the exhibition on March 23, 1974 would coincide with a special celebration explicitly called "A Woman Made Day" to include an array of events such as a gynecological self-help slideshow by the Feminist Women's Health Center, a karate and self-defense demonstration by Karen Iwafuchi, an open forum on survival and power by the Commission Against Rape, a presentation about the creation of the Feminist Studio Workshop (the entity that founded the Women's Building), and a jamming performance by Helen.

With ''Strawberry Jam'' (1973) and ''Off Strawberry Wall'' (1974), Helen reaffirmed the work of art as an opening for participants to learn, sense, and even bond with their food sources as precious—and in turn to see themselves as capable of making growth and form choices that benefit society without degrading the earth. These two strawberry works also signaled a turning point in a new politics of knowledge—an affirmative politics—by which Helen and Newton Harrison began combining scientific research on environmental issues like pollution and global warming with self-critical introspection, mixed media technologies, and the live action of performance art to energize the epistemologies and ontologies of academia and civic life.&lt;ref&gt;The "Switching Careers Midstream" segment of this page is adapted from Eliasieh, Laura (née Rogers).

== Collaborative Studio Practice ==
Helen and Newton recruited their youngest son Gabriel Harrison and Vera Westergaard to join them in establishing the Harrison Studio in 1993. The Studio relocated from La Jolla to Santa Cruz in 2004. The Harrison Studio's subject matter ranges across a large number of disciplines, yet always has at its core the eco-social well-being of place and community. Whether dealing with the reclamation of watersheds, reforestation, or modest projects in cities and their surrounds, whole systems thinking guides the conceptual processes of their research. They have exhibited broadly and internationally with large-scale installations using diverse media that have critical and propositional thinking in them. They use the exhibition format in several ways, often in the sense of a town meeting, always with the intention of seeing their proposals moving off the walls, landing in planning processes, and ultimately resulting in interventions towards social and environmental justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Helen and Newton Harrison - InterSciWiki|url = http://128.200.18.105/wiki/index.php/Helen_and_Newton_Harrison|website = 128.200.18.105|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harrison Studio locates their work within the domains of both art and science. By operating in the domain of art, the Harrisons teach the ecological dimensions of the human condition better than they could were they working in the domain of science. By doing art with ecological content, the Studio implies that the human species should treat the planet as a sculpture. The first major collaborative work Helen and Newton produced in the early 1970s is known collectively as ''Survival Pieces'', so named because they intended each installation in the series to contribute to the design of a productive and sustainable food system (e.g. hog pasture, a catfish farm, and a citrus and avocado orchard). The ''Survival Pieces'' were exhibited in reputable galleries, commissioned by major museums, praised by influential critics, and studied by historians as well as philosophers. The work heralded future histories of [[BioArt]] and debates over the ethics, ontologies, and affects of non-human or posthuman life. The Harrisons worked with living entities as art mediums, and adopted biofunctions like waste, procreating, growing, evolving, dying, and decaying as art processes. Helen and Newton began working with global warming in the late 1970s as a result of a career-defining work called “The Lagoon Cycle”. All the work the Harrison Studio does involving this issue assumes that the world's oceans are indeed rising and reshaping the planet; they too are sculptors. This poetic idea is especially prominent in the Harrison Studio’s ongoing series “The Force Majeure” (2007–Present).

The [http://www.centerforforcemajeure.org/ Center for the Study of the Force Majeure], founded by Helen and Newton Harrison at UC Santa Cruz, operates on the principle that "We as a species must adapt ourselves to a very different world...proceed[ing] on our assertion that ecologically based, large-scale systems of adaptation to the extreme changes in the ever-warming environment are necessary for collective survival and so must be invented. Seen metaphorically, two frontiers are emergent and evolving exponentially: One is a wave front of water, advancing on the edges of all continents that touch the oceans; the other is a heat wave that is increasingly (apparently slowly, but in fact exponentially) and covering, touching, and affecting the whole planet and the lives on it. These are different from all other frontiers that have been part of human experience, frontiers that we have advanced toward, most often by conquering or exploiting to our own advantage. These new frontiers move toward us, and our habitual responses of exploiting resources for production, consumption, and profit are no longer meaningful behaviors. Rather, we must adapt ourselves to meet these two frontiers on the scale on which they operate."

One of the Harrison Studio projects from 1993, entitled ''Serpentine Lattice'', was quite successful. It was an installation that measured 10’x36′, and consisted of a dissolving slide mural of the disappearing North American Pacific Coast Temperate Rain Forest. The installation also included a 12’x36′ hand drawn map, text and forest image photo panels. At the time, 95% of the old forest growth had been harvested, and the cutting of the trees had left around 75 thousand miles of disturbed river and stream. The Studio created a design that would require controlling the high ground from the San Francisco Bay to Yakutat Bay in Alaska. This would create a scaffolding for the sustainable reclaiming of the Pacific Northwest Temperate Coastal Rain Forest. The main idea was to generate an eco-friendly security system, not too different from the social security system, and to use 1% of the Gross National Product to try and fight against the seemingly endless destruction of the environment. Included in this installation was a piece of writing to better explain their ideas and reasoning. This project took place at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Susan Fillin-Yeh supported the Harrisons in this endeavor. Douglas F. Cooley, from the Memorial Art Gallery of the college, commissioned the project. ''Serpentine Lattice'' is now in the permanent collection of the [[San Jose Museum of Art]].

Harrison Studio works are mainly done by invitation and commission. They often come when they are asked to begin research, propose ideas, and discuss with leaders in the area to try to make a change. They leave when they feel their work is done, or they have done all they are able to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = To Life!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6276">"'''The Light-House'''" is the unofficial title of the last work written by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. He [[unfinished work|did not live to finish it]], and had barely begun it by the time of [[death of Edgar Allan Poe|his death]] in 1849.

==Plot summary==
The story is told as a series of [[diary]] entries, the first being [[New Year's Day]], 1796.  The setting is an island off the coast of Norway.

On January 1, the narrator records that it is his first day in the [[lighthouse]], and records his annoyance at the fact that he had a difficult time getting the appointment to man it, even though he is of noble birth.  He records that a storm is in progress, and that the ship that brought him "had a narrow pass".  He also dwells on the concept of being alone, and how much he looks forward to spending time alone, just him and his dog Neptune, so he can write his book.  He briefly comments that he hears some echo in the walls, thinking they may not be sturdy, but catches himself and claims that his worries are "all nonsense", alluding to a prophecy made by his friend DeGrat, who got him the appointment to the lighthouse.

On January 2 he describes the sea as being calm and uneventful, the wind having "lulled about day-break", and expounds on his passion for being alone.

On January 3 he describes the day as being calm and placid, and resolves to explore the lighthouse. He again begins to worry about the safety of the structure, but tries to reassure himself.  The last line reads, "The basis on which the structure rests seems to me to be chalk..."

A heading for January 4 follows, but there is no text.

==Composition==
Biographer [[Kenneth Silverman]] believes Poe began writing "The Light-House" between May and August 1849.&lt;ref name=Silverman412&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 412. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was never officially titled.&lt;ref name=Silverman412/&gt;

It is uncertain how the story would have ended and there is some debate if "The Light-House" was intended as a short story or a novel. Silverman speculates that the work might have been complete in its two-page form and the final blank entry implied the narrator's death.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 412–413. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is likely the last fiction work Poe wrote.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 414. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
{{Original research|date=December 2007}}
Themes of foreboding,&lt;ref name=Silverman412/&gt; isolation and [[paranoia]] are apparent in "The Light-House".

Its style is very straightforward and plainspoken, in contrast to the more elaborate and decorated prose of Poe's earlier stories, implying a shift in Poe's writing style which the author did not live to realize.

Like many of Poe's works, "The Light-House" has been studied autobiographically. The lighthouse keeper, then, stands in for Poe himself, who is expressing his own feelings of being alone and isolated and questioning if he can survive.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, Kenneth. ''Edgar A. Poe: Mournful and Never-ending Remembrance''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1991: 413. {{ISBN|0-06-092331-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very similar in theme to the later and also unfinished short story "[[The Burrow (story)|The Burrow]]" by [[Franz Kafka]]. Both involve a reclusive narrator who obsesses over the safety of his enclosure, though Kafka's work was much closer to completion and, consequentially, much more elaborate.  Given the obscurity of Poe's story, it is very unlikely that Kafka had read it.
[[File:Fantastic 195301-02 v1 n2.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Fantastic (magazine)|Fantastic]]'' published Robert Bloch's story based on the Poe fragment as "A '''New''' Edgar Allan Poe Masterpiece".]]

==Inspiration==
Author and surgeon Dr. [[Richard Selzer]] included his short story 'Poe's Light-house', inspired by [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s 'The Light-House', in 'The Doctor Stories', published by Picador. [[Joyce Carol Oates]] also used Poe's "The Light-House" as an inspiration for the story 'Poe Posthumous, or The Light-House' in her collection ''Wild Nights!'' (2008). Leigh M. Lane's ''Finding Poe'' (2012) speculates the role Poe's own works, including "The Lighthouse", may have played in his mysterious death.

==Adaptations==
Author [[Robert Bloch]] finished Poe's tale and published it in the February 1969 issue (#53) of ''Famous Monsters of Filmland'' as "Horror in the Lighthouse". An earlier version appeared in the January/February 1953 Ziff-Davis publication ''Fantastic'' entitled "The Lighthouse".

In addition to Bloch's adaption of "The Light-House", in the TV show ''[[The Following]]'', fictional psychopath and serial killer Joe Carroll (played by [[James Purefoy]]) writes a novel inspired by Poe's tale, titling it ''The Gothic Sea''.

In 1997 Ediciones Áltera commissioned a number of Spanish and Latin American writers to complete the story, each in their own manner. They included [[Cristina Fernández Cubas]], whose version is included in her anthology “Todos los cuentos” (Tusquets editores, 2008).

A 2016 film, ''Edgar Allan Poe‘s Lighthouse Keeper'',&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, B. (2016). Edgar Allan Poe’s Lighthouse Keeper. USA. Retrieved from https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3181898/&lt;/ref&gt; was loosely based on the story. While themes of isolation and unease in the building were preserved, the film took inspiration from Roger Corman's Poe adaptations from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, B. (2016).

'''''The Lost Letter''''' ({{lang-uk|Пропала Грамота|Propala Hramota}}, {{lang-ru|Пропавшая грамота|Propavshaya gramota}}) is a 1972 Soviet musical-[[tragicomedy]] film by [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]] in [[Kiev]]. The movie is considered a pearl of Ukrainian cinema. The film is based on the novella ''[[The Lost Letter: A Tale Told by the Sexton of the N...Church]]'' by [[Nikolai Gogol]] from cycle ''[[Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka]]''.

== Synopsis ==
Cossack Vasyl ([[Ivan Mykolaichuk]]) prepares himself for a mounted voyage to [[Saint Petersburg|Peterburg]], the capital of the [[Russian Empire]]. Vasyl carries a hramota (sealed official document) given to him by the [[hetman]] through his secretary, Pereverny-Kruchenko, that is rumored to cost ten [[Pood]]s of gold. Vasyl's wife sews the hramota into his hat and his father ([[Vasyl Symchych]]) gives him magic tobacco to repel evil and an advice to find a good co-journeyman. 

The film depicts the adventures of Vasyl in sequences that are filled with [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian culture]], and shows [[Ukrainian cuisine]], costumes, traditions, mystical and comedy-filled situations, anecdotes, and a plethora of obstacles which Vasyl must overcome. On his way together with an evil servant ([[chort]]) he comes to a river crossing where a ferry carries people from one side to another. There he finds his partner in arms, Andriy, a [[Zaporozhian Cossacks|zaporozhian cossack]]. Further along the way, something happens to the papers when they stop at an inn to rest. When Vasyl and Andriy arrive in St. Petersburg, they hand over the hramota to the baroness ''von Likhtenberg'' who passes them to the empress. The documents do not carry any information and Vasyl has to leave without results. 

On the way home, both of them decide to shoot each other. As they are saying in [[unison]] the [[Nicene Creed]] (Apostles' Creed) they hear a voice that identifies itself as Kudz coming from a nearby rock, saying he was the same chort and the witch turned him into a rock after he helped Vasyl. Kudz asks them to throw him in a nearby marsh so as not to cause any further harm to random travelers on the road. As Vasyl arrives with his friend near their village, [[Dykanka]], they meet a little boy who asks them to let him go to see the cossack, Vasyl who had supposedly returned from having seen the empress. Then they arrive and are met by the rest of the village population. Moments later, everybody awaits Vasyl again by his house to tell the story of his rendezvous with the empress. In the last scene, he wishes the little boy to have a loyal horse, an open field, and always be at people's service. The scene is accompanied by the triumphant ''Cossack march'' of the Ukrainian folkloric song about [[Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny|Sahaidachny]].

==Administrative issues==
The film was supposed to be directed by Viktor Hres, featuring [[Anatoly Papanov]] in the lead role. However, when Hres became suddenly ill, he offered it to Borys Ivchenko. The latter agreed on the condition that the main role would be given to [[Ivan Mykolaychuk]]. The script was remade and the movie was filmed in 1972 at the [[Dovzhenko Film Studios]]. However, Soviet censors banned it from being screened. Nevertheless, in 1973 the Bureau of Soviet Cinematography Propaganda in Moscow published 50 thousand pamphlets with images of Ivan Mykolaychuk in role of Cossack Vasyl. 

The movie was finally released after the fall of the Soviet Union. It received the [[Golden Pagoda Award]] during the movie festival in [[Bangkok]] (see [[Cinema of Thailand]]). All the songs in the movie were contributed by Ivan Mykolaychuk, who also helped [[Ivan Drach]] write the movie's script.

'''''The Siege''''' is a Palestinian play developed and devised by [[The Freedom Theatre]]. It recounts the story of the 2002 [[Siege of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen |first=Ariel |url=http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-cohen042402.asp |title=The Nativity Sin |publisher=National Review Online |date=April 24, 2002 |accessdate=2012-07-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817045355/http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-cohen042402.asp |archivedate=August 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK Tour==
In May 2015, The Freedom Theatre embarked on its first ever tour of the UK. The Siege was the biggest touring production ever performed in Britain by a Palestinian theatre company.

The UK tour was organized by The Freedom Theatre UK Friends, a network of over 300 people in Britain who are engaged in the theatre’s activities. The Siege and its UK tour are supported by the EU, the British Council, Steps Beyond – European Cultural Foundation, Arts Council England and The Roddick Foundation. Other supporters include the playwright, [[Howard Brenton]] and film-maker, [[Ken Loach]].

Funding by [[Arts Council England]] angered local Jewish community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.K. funding of Palestinian play angers local Jewish community|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/1.654750|agency=Haaretz|date=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish actress [[Maureen Lipman]] joined pro-Israel groups including [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland|Zionist Federation]] in a protest outside the London premiere of ''The Siege'' at [[Battersea Arts Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firsht|first1=Naomi|title=Maureen Lipman joins protest outside theatre staging The Siege|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/136602/maureen-lipman-joins-protest-outside-theatre-staging-the-siege|agency=Jewish Chronicle|date=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Voyage of Life''''' is a series of paintings created by [[Thomas Cole]] in 1842, representing an [[allegory]] of the four stages of human life: childhood, youth, manhood, and old age. The paintings depict a voyager who travels in a boat on a river through the mid-19th-century American wilderness.  In each painting the voyager rides the boat on the River of Life accompanied by a [[Guardian angel (spirit)|guardian angel]]. The landscape, each reflecting one of the four [[season|seasons of the year]], plays a major role in conveying the story. With each installment the boat's direction of travel is reversed from the previous picture. In childhood, the infant glides from a dark cave into a rich, green landscape. As a youth, the boy takes control of the boat and aims for a shining castle in the sky. In manhood, the adult relies on prayer and religious faith to sustain him through rough waters and a threatening landscape. Finally, the man becomes old and the angel guides him to heaven across the waters of [[eternity]].

==Background==
Thomas Cole is regarded as the founder of the [[Hudson River School]], an [[Visual arts of the United States|American art]] movement that flourished in the mid-19th century and was concerned with the realistic and detailed portrayal of nature but with a strong influence from [[Romanticism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/125174/Thomas-Cole Encyclopædia Britannica] Retrieved December 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This group of American landscape painters worked between about 1825 and 1870 and shared a sense of national pride as well as an interest in celebrating the unique natural beauty found in the [[United States]]. The wild, untamed nature found in America was viewed as its special character; Europe had ancient ruins, but America had the uncharted wilderness. As Cole's friend [[William Cullen Bryant]] sermonized in verse, so Cole sermonized in paint. Both men saw nature as God's work and as a refuge from the ugly materialism of cities. Cole clearly intended ''The Voyage of Life'' to be a didactic, moralizing series of paintings using the landscape as an allegory for religious faith.

Unlike Cole's first major series, ''[[The Course of Empire (paintings)|The Course of Empire]]'', which focused on the stages of civilization as a whole, ''The Voyage of Life'' series is a more personal, [[Christian]] allegory that interprets visually the journey of man through four stages of life: infancy, youth, manhood and old age. Done on [[Contract|commission]], the finished works generated a disagreement with the owner about a public exhibition. In 1842, when Cole was in Rome, he did a second set of the series which on his return to America was shown to acclaim.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The first set is at the [[Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute]] in [[Utica, New York]], and the second set is at the [[National Gallery of Art]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]

In the first painting, ''Childhood'', all the important story elements of the series are introduced: the voyager, the angel, the river, and the expressive landscape. An infant is safely ensconced in a boat guided by an angel. The landscape is lush; everything is calm and basking in warm sunshine, reflecting the innocence and joy of childhood. The boat glides out of a dark, craggy cave which Cole himself described as "emblematic of our earthly origin, and the mysterious Past."&lt;ref name="p1990"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; The river is smooth and narrow, symbolizing the sheltered experience of childhood. The figurehead on the prow holds an hourglass representing [[time]].

The second painting, ''Youth'', shows the same rich, green landscape, but here the view widens as does the voyager's experience. Now the youth grabs the [[tiller]] firmly as the angel watches and waves from the shore, allowing him to take control. The boy's enthusiasm and energy is evident in his forward-thrusting pose and billowing clothes. In the distance, a ghostly castle hovers in the sky, a white and shimmering beacon that represents the ambitions and dreams of man.

[[File:Detail, Voyage of Life, Youth. Thomas Cole..JPG|thumb|left|Detail of Thomas Cole's ''The Voyage of Life: Youth'': shows the boy departing in the boat; the angel bids him farewell from the shore.]]
To the youth, the calm river seems to lead straight to the castle, but at the far right of the painting one can just glimpse the river as it becomes rough, choppy, and full of rocks. Cole comments on the landscape and the youth's ambitions: "The scenery of the picture—its clear stream, its lofty trees, its towering mountains, its unbounded distance, and transparent atmosphere—figure forth the romantic beauty of youthful imaginings, when the mind elevates the Mean and Common into the Magnificent, before experience teaches what is the Real."

===''Manhood''===

}}
Cole's renowned four-part series traces the journey of an archetypal hero along the "River of Life." Confidently assuming control of his destiny and oblivious to the dangers that await him, the voyager boldly strives to reach an aerial castle, emblematic of the daydreams of "Youth" and its aspirations for glory and fame. As the traveler approaches his goal, the ever more turbulent stream deviates from its course and relentlessly carries him toward the next picture in the series, where nature's fury, evil demons, and self-doubt will threaten his very existence. Only prayer, Cole suggests, can save the voyager from a dark and tragic fate.

From the innocence of childhood, to the flush of youthful overconfidence, through the trials and tribulations of middle age, to the hero's triumphant salvation, ''The Voyage of Life'' seems intrinsically linked to the Christian doctrine of death and resurrection. Cole's intrepid voyager also may be read as a personification of America, itself at an adolescent stage of development. The artist may have been issuing a dire warning to those caught up in the feverish quest for Manifest Destiny: that unbridled westward expansion and industrialization would have tragic consequences for both man and the land itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Cole|first=Thomas|title=The Voyage of Life: Manhood|date=1842|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.52452.html|accessdate=2017-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Old Age'' ===

The final painting, ''Old Age'', is an image of [[death]]. The man has grown old; he has survived the trials of life. The waters have calmed; the river flows into the waters of eternity. The figurehead and hourglass are missing from the battered boat; the withered old voyager has reached the end of earthly time. In the distance, angels are descending from heaven, while the guardian angel hovers close, gesturing toward the others. The man is once again joyous with the knowledge that faith has sustained him through life. The landscape is practically gone, just a few rough rocks represent the edge of the earthly world, and dark water stretches onward. Cole describes the scene: "The chains of corporeal existence are falling away; and already the mind has glimpses of Immortal Life."

==Cultural significance==
''The Voyage of Life'' was well received by critics and the public; the United States was experiencing the [[Christian revival|religious revival]] sometimes known as the [[Second Great Awakening]]. The four paintings were converted to engravings by [[James Smillie (engraver)|James Smillie]] (1807–85) after Cole's death and the engravings widely distributed in time for the [[Third Great Awakening]], giving the series the prestige and popular acclaim it retains today.&lt;ref name="p1997"&gt;{{harvnb|Powell|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Way of the Sufi''''' was the best-selling follow-up introduction to [[Sufism]] by the writer [[Idries Shah]] after the publication of his first book on the subject, ''[[The Sufis]]''. Whereas ''The Sufis'' eschewed academic norms such as footnotes and an index, ''The Way of the Sufi'' provided a full section of notes and a bibliography at the end of its first chapter, entitled "The Study of Sufism in the West".

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''The Way of the Sufi'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Summary==
As in ''[[The Sufis]]'', Shah gave potted biographies of some of the best known Sufis of the ages, while adding brief descriptions of four of the major Sufi orders, or Tariqas: the [[Chishti Order|Chisti]] Order, [[Qadiriyyah|Qadiri]] Order, [[Suhrawardiyya|Suhrawardi]] Order and [[Naqshbandi]] Order. In addition there were a number of Sufi [[teaching stories]] as well as question-and-answer sessions with Sufi teachers. Continuing a theme from the previous book, Shah argued that Sufism had greatly influenced Western civilisation over the centuries, but that this had largely gone unrecognised, citing examples such as [[Chaucer]], [[Shakespeare]], the [[William Tell]] legend, the former [[United Nations]] secretary-general [[Dag Hammarskjoeld]] and the works of [[Sir Richard Burton]] amongst others. In the East, he also said that Sufism had influenced certain aspects of [[Hinduism]] as well as [[Zen Buddhism]].

==Reception==
The book was well received on publication, with the [[BBC]]'s ''The Critics'' programme declaring it an "outstanding book of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''waistline''' is the line of demarcation between the upper and lower portions of a garment, which notionally corresponds to the natural waist but may vary with fashion from just below the bust to below the hips.  The waistline of a [[clothing|garment]] is often used to accentuate different features.  The waistline is also important as a boundary at which shaping [[dart (sewing)|dart]]s (such as those over the bust and in the back) can be ended.

==Types of waistlines==
Similar to [[neckline]]s, waistlines may be grouped by their shape, depth, and location of the body.

* '''None''': The [[princess seams]] style of dress needs no waistline at all, since it does its shaping without darts, by joining edges of different curvature. The resulting "princess seams" typically run vertically from the shoulder (or under the arm) over the bust point and down to the lower hem. This creates a long, slimming look, often seen in dresses with an "[[A-line (clothing)|A-line]]" silhouette.
* '''Diagonal''': An asymmetrical waistline that runs across the body diagonally. Usually the highest point is below the natural waistline.
* '''Drop waist''': A low, horizontal waistline that usually falls near the level of the upper hips. Balances the upper and lower bodies, and adds to the visual impression of height by lengthening the torso. Common in [[1920s in fashion|1920s silhouettes]].
* '''Empire''': A high waistline that cuts horizontally across the body, just below the bust. This waistline gives a long, slender look and excellent fabric drape in the skirt and allows for short, inconspicuous shaping darts. This waistline was popular in [[Jane Austen]]'s [[1795–1820 in fashion|time]]; see [[Empire silhouette]].
* '''Raised''': A horizontal waistline that falls significantly above (&gt;1 in.) the natural waist.
* '''Natural''': A horizontal waistline that falls at the natural waist and tends to make the wearer seem shorter by visually dividing the figure in half.
* '''V-shaped''': A generally flattering waistline, especially for figures with notable curvature. Also known as the '''Basque waistline''' or the '''[[Antebellum era|Antebellum]] waistline'''.   
* '''U-shaped''': A softer, less pronounced version of the Basque waistline.
* '''Inverted V-shaped''': Starts high in the center and drops at the sides and can fall as high as the bustline (e.g., paired with a low V neckline to give a "bowtie" look), but usually found near the hips (e.g., extending Bolero curves in the bodice).
* '''Inverted U-shaped''': A softer, less pronounced version of the inverted-V waistline, usually a gentle downwards curve.

==Secure mechanisms==
Waistlines can be secured with a variety of methods:

* [[Button (clothing)|Button]]
* [[Fastener#Types|Clasp]]
* [[Drawstring]]
* [[Elastomer|Elastic]]
* [[Knot]]
* [[Zipper]]
