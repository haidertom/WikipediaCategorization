'''Artmedia''' was one of the first scientific projects concerning the relationship between art, technology, philosophy and [[aesthetics]]. It was founded in 1985 at the [[University of Salerno]]. For over two decades, until 2009, dozens of projects, studies, exhibitions and conferences on new technologies&lt;ref&gt;In addition to the ten international "Artmedia" conferences, which took place in Salerno and Paris from 1985 to 2008, the Laboratory has led to numerous other initiatives and events, such as "L'immaginario tecnologico", 1984 (conference and exhibition); "Technettronica", 1989 (Exhibition about the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e antropologia", 1983 (International Symposium); "Tecnologie e forme nell'arte e nella scienza", 2003 (International Symposium); "New Technologies: Roy Ascott, Maurizio Bolognini, Fred Forest, Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos", Museo del Sannio, 2003 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Estetica e tecnologia", 1987 (Symposium); "L'immateriale in piazza" (Aitiani, Forest, Mitropoulos, Grossi, Prado), Naples, 1992 (Exhibition on the Aesthetics of Communication); "Un'estetica per i media" 1989 (RAI, Dipartimento Scuola Educazione, TV program); "Cartacarbone", 1990 (radio program); "Coincidences", 1995 (Aesthetics journal, in French); "Epiphaneia", 1995-1996 (Aesthetics journal, in Italian). See ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; made Artmedia a reference point for many internationally renowned scholars and artists,&lt;ref&gt;A. R., ''Des hauts et débats. Colloque Artmedia VIII'', "Liberation", November 29, 2002, p. 13; ''Dossier: De l’esthétique de la communication au Net Art'', "Art Press", 285, November 2002, pp. 37-43.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the growing cultural interest in the aesthetics of [[New media|media]], the aesthetics of [[Computer network|networks]], and their [[ethical]] and [[Anthropology|anthropological]] implications.

==Beginnings and international events==
Since the late 1970s, a permanent ''Seminar of the Aesthetics of Media and Communication'' has been directed by its founder [[Mario Costa (philosopher)|Mario Costa]] at the University of Salerno. The basic principles of the aesthetics of technological communication were identified and conceptualized in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the "aesthetics of communication", especially upon its debut in the 1980s, is recorded in the book by Mario Costa,''The Aesthetics of Communication. Aesthetic use of simultaneity at a distance'', Rome, Castelvecchi, 1999; its basic principles, formulated by Costa, were expressed for the first time in ''News and Notes'', published by the International Center of Aesthetic Communication, Salerno, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; A conference on "Technological Imaginary", held in 1984 at the Museo del Sannio in [[Benevento]], discussed the issue of the new relationship between art and technology and the consequent need to re-evaluate aesthetics, warning that "all our future existence will be played at the crossroads between technology and imaginary".&lt;ref&gt;"Aa. Vv., ''L’immaginario tecnologico'', Museo del Sannio, Benevento, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The comprehensive relationship between art and [[technoscience]], technology, and philosophy has also been the theoretical subject of the ten international "Artmedia" conferences which were held in Salerno and Paris between 1985 and 2008. Particularly relevant were conferences held in Paris between 2002 and 2008, which took place at the [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]], the [[Bibliotheque Nationale de France]] (BNF) and the Institut National d'Histoire de l 'Art (INHA), with the partnership of the Société Française d'Esthétique, the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], the [[University of Toronto]], the [[Universidade de São Paulo]], the [[Sorbonne University|Université de Paris 1 Sorbonne]], and the U.S. magazine [[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]].&lt;ref&gt;See Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan, and ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuous debate between artists and theorists==

Artmedia wanted to gather theorists and artists from all over the world and encourage both joint and complementary work, beginning with the need to give attention to theoretical and artistic practices and developing both together. These also contributed towards spreading the spirit of the project, both in a number of festivals and shows, and through their own artworks and research.&lt;ref&gt;Antonella Fimiani, ''Arte &amp; tecnologia, la frontiera-Salerno'', in "Il Mattino", November 24, 1999, p. 23; Sylvie Lisiecki e Marie Saladin, ''Fenetrês sur les arts numériques'', in "Croniques de la Bibliothèque Nationale de France", 46, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Theorists who worked with Artmedia and participated in its activities included [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[René Berger]], [[Abraham Moles]], [[Derrick De Kerckhove]], [[Pierre Levy]], Gillo Dorfles, [[Paul Virilio]], [[Frank Popper]], [[Roger Malina]], Daniel Charles, José Jiménez, Anne Cauquelin, [[Edgar Morin]], [[Thierry de Duve]], [[Catherine Millet]], Filiberto Menna, Andreas Broeckmann, Rudolf zur Lippe, [[Edmond Couchot]], Dominique Chateau, Yannick Geffroy, Philippe Queau, Arlindo Machado, Tetsuo Kogawa, and Bernard Teyssedre.

Artists included [[Fred Forest]], [[Roy Ascott]], [[Takahiko Iimura]], [[Maurizio Bolognini]], [[Tom Klinkowstein]], Tom Sherman, [[Eduardo Kac]], Enzo Minarelli, [[James Dashow]], [[Peter D'Agostino]], Mit Mitropoulos, [[Shawn Brixey]], Bruno Di Bello, [[Antoni Muntadas]], [[Orlan]], Kit Galloway, [[David Rokeby]], [[Miguel Chevalier]], [[Norman White]], Richard Kriesche, Olivier Auber, [[Caterina Davinio]] and [[Casey Reas]].&lt;ref&gt;On the participation of artists and theorists, see in particular: Mario Costa, Fred Forest (eds) (2011), ''Ethique, esthétique, communication technologique dans l'art contemporain ou le destin du sens'', Paris: Institut National Audiovisuel, Editions L'Harmattan; Mario Costa (ed.) (2004), ''New Technologies: [[Roy Ascott]], Maurizio Bolognini, [[Fred Forest]], Richard Kriesche, Mit Mitropoulos'', Salerno: Artmedia, Museo del Sannio; ''Dossier Artmedia VIII'', in "Ligeia", Paris, 2002, pp. 21-245; ''Edition spéciale Artmedia'', "Art Press", Paris, 2002; see also the OLATS/Leonardo websites: http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2002/mono_index.php and http://www.olats.org/projetpart/artmedia/2008/mono_index.php .&lt;/ref&gt;

The questions raised in various projects promoted by Artmedia, in a continuous dialogue between artists and theorists, led to discussions on topics including ''Aesthetics of Communication and the anthropology of the future'' (1985), ''Global aesthetic communication'' (1986), ''Electronic performativity and the art system'' (1990), ''Neo-technological arts between aesthetics and communication'' (1992), ''Aesthetic research and technology'' (1995), ''Developments in aesthetics: change or mutation?'' (1999), ''From the Aesthetics of Communication to Net art'' (2002), and ''Ethics, aesthetics and techno-communication. The future of meaning'' (2008).

All Artmedia symposiums have been followed by many publications. For the two held in Paris, a complete video recording is also available, and can be viewed at the [[Institut National de l'Audiovisuel]].

An assessment of 25 years of Artmedia activity was made into a seminar on ''The aesthetic object of the future'', held at the [[University of Salerno]] in 2009. The Artmedia project produced a large number of publications and documents that are being catalogued, with a view to their proper placement and use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2543">{{Nihongo|'''Atomic bomb literature'''|原爆文学|Genbaku bungaku}} is a [[literary genre]] in [[Japanese literature]] used to describe writing about the atomic [[bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. This can include diaries, testimonial or documentary accounts, poetry, drama or fictional works about the bombings and their aftermath.

There are several generations of atomic bomb writers. The first, made up of actual survivors of the bombings, who wrote of their own experiences, includes [[Yōko Ōta]], [[Tamiki Hara]], [[Shinoe Shoda]], and [[Sadako Kurihara]]. The second, who wrote about the bomb in order to invoke the wider social and political issues it raises, includes [[Yoshie Hotta]], [[Momo Iida]], [[Kenzaburō Ōe]], [[Masuji Ibuse]], [[Ineko Sata]]. The third, whose writing looks to the future in a post-nuclear world, includes [[Kōbō Abe]], [[Makoto Oda (novelist)|Makoto Oda]], and [[Mitsuharu Inoue]].&lt;ref&gt;Treat, John Whittier. Writing Ground Zero: Japanese Literature and the Atomic Bomb. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known work of atomic bomb literature is ''[[Black Rain (novel)|Black Rain]]'' by Masuji Ibuse. 

Works by non-Japanese authors that could also be deemed{{By whom|date=August 2010}} as atomic bomb literature include John Hersey's ''Hiroshima''.

Art dealers Ernst Beyeler (16 July 1921 – 25 February 2010) and Hilda Kunz (1922 - 18 July 2008), known as Hildy, created the Beyeler Foundation in 1982 and commissioned [[Renzo Piano]] to design a museum to house their private collection.&lt;ref&gt;William Grimes (26 February 2010), [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/27/arts/design/27beyeler.html Ernst Beyeler, Top Dealer of Modern Art, Dies at 88] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection was first publicly exhibited in its entirety at the [[Centro de Arte Reina Sofía]] in Madrid in 1989, and was subsequently shown at [[Neue Nationalgalerie]] in Berlin in 1993 and the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]] in Sydney in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8964623 Swiss art museum founder Ernst Beyeler dies at 88] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By building Renzo Piano's museum structure in 1997, the Beyeler Foundation made its collection permanently accessible to the public. The museum is properly funded, and it receives annual grants from the cantons of [[Baselstadt|Basel City]] and [[Baselland|Basel County]] and the commune of Riehen.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bailey (14 June 2013), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/An+art-lovers%E2%80%99+paradise/29923 An art-lovers’ paradise]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810075417/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/An%2Bart-lovers%E2%80%99%2Bparadise/29923 |date=10 August 2013  }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Major partners of the Foundation are Bayer AG, Novartis and Swiss bank [[UBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation Beyerler. Partners and Sponsors|url=https://www.fondationbeyeler.ch/en/join-support/partners-and-sponsors|publisher=Fondation Beyerle|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2006, approximately 340,000 persons visited the museum. The number of visitors in 2016 was 332,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/f7891ebc-49d5-11e7-a3f4-c742b9791d43|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection and exhibitions ==

The Beyeler Foundation opened its doors on 18 October 1997, presenting 140 works of modern classics, including 23 Picassos. The overall collection of 200 works of [[Modern art|classic modernism]] reflect the views of Hildy and Ernst Beyeler on 20th-century art and highlight features typical of the period from [[Claude Monet]], [[Paul Cézanne]] and [[Vincent van Gogh]] to [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Andy Warhol]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)]]. The paintings appear alongside some 25 objects of [[tribal art]] from [[African art|Africa]], [[Art of Oceania|Oceania]] and [[Alaska]]. A third of the exhibition space is reserved for special exhibitions staged to complement the permanent collection. 

The culmination of Beyeler's career came in 2007 when all the works that passed through his hands were reunited at the museum for a grand exhibition that included van Gogh's 1889 ''Portrait of Postman Roulin'', Lichtenstein's ''Plus and Minus III'' and a huge expressive drip painting by [[Jackson Pollock]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8964623 Swiss art museum founder Ernst Beyeler dies at 88] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection is expanding, particularly in terms of works made after 1950 (recent acquisitions include pieces by [[Louise Bourgeois]] and [[Wolfgang Tillmans]]).&lt;ref&gt;Martin Bailey (14 June 2013), [http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/An+art-lovers%E2%80%99+paradise/29923 An art-lovers’ paradise]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810075417/http://theartnewspaper.com/articles/An%2Bart-lovers%E2%80%99%2Bparadise/29923 |date=10 August 2013  }} ''[[The Art Newspaper]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The garden surrounding the museum also periodically serves as a venue for special exhibitions. In a work called "Wrapped Trees", [[Christo and Jeanne-Claude]] veiled 178 trees in the park around the Beyeler Foundation and in the adjacent Berower Park between 13 November and 14 December 1998.

== Architecture ==
[[File:Fond.Beyeler Garten2.JPG|thumb|''White Curves'' (2002), made of white aluminium, by [[Ellsworth Kelly]]]]
Embedded in the Berowerpark in the Basel suburb of Riehen, the building features a glazed façade largely looking out onto the corn fields and vines covering the Tüllinger Hills. The two perimeter walls of the original garden site inspired the idea of the museum’s layout. Four 115-metre-long supporting [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] walls running from north to south and standing 7m apart define the plan of the building. Resting on top of the solid foundation walls, the lightweight glass roof, white enamelled on the reverse, admits northern light but screens off light from the east and the west. Along the northern and the southern sides the roof projects far beyond the walls, shading the glass façades from the sun. Less than two years after the museum's inauguration in autumn 1997, the building was lengthened by 12 metres. This increased the exhibition area by 458 m² to its current 3,764 m².

Situated vis-à-vis the museum building, the late-Baroque Villa Berower houses the museum's administration department and a restaurant.

The '''Book of Fermoy''' ({{Lang-ga|Leabhar Fhear Maí}}, aka '''RIA MS 23''' or the '''Book of Roche''', ''leabhar de Róiste'') is a medieval Irish text dated to the 14th to 16th century AD.{{sfn|RIA}}

==History==
The book was written in the [[Irish language]] in the 15th C. by several scribes. The 238 pages contain numerous tales, histories, and biographies.{{sfn|RIA}} [[James Henthorn Todd]] acquired the work in 1858 - he suggested the title "Book of Roche" would be equally applicable to the work due to the large quantity of content relating to the history of the Roche Family of Fermoy; one "David [Mór] son of Maurice son of John Roche" is mentioned in the text as a patron of one set of scribes.{{sfn|RIA}}

[[File:Casting Cats.jpg|thumb|Casting call for [[black cat]]s, Los Angeles, 1961. The studio was seeking cats for the [[Roger Corman]] movie ''[[Tales of Terror]].'']]

In the [[performing arts]] industry such as [[theatre]], [[film]], or [[television]], a '''casting''' (or '''casting call''') is a [[pre-production]] process for selecting a certain type of [[actor]], [[dancer]], [[singer]], or [[extra (acting)|extra]] for a particular role or part in a script, [[screenplay]], or [[teleplay]]. This process is typically utilized for a motion picture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Motion Pictures|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|date=December 14, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006161746/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/motion-pictures/|archivedate=October 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[television program]], [[documentary]], [[music video]], [[play (theatre)|play]], or [[television advertisement]], etc. This involvement in a dramatic production, [[advertisement]], and or [[industrial video]] is intended for an [[audience]], or [[studio audience]].

==Casting process==
The casting process involves a series of [[audition (performing arts)|audition]]s before a casting panel, composed of individuals within a [[theatrical production]] such as [[theatrical producer]], and [[theater director]]. However, within a given [[Television program#Production|television production]] a casting panel can consist of a [[television producer]], or within [[filmmaking|film production]] a casting panel could contain a [[film producer]], [[film director]], and/or [[choreographer]]. Usually, in nearly all areas of [[show business]], a casting director&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Does a Casting Director Do?|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|date=Apr 29, 2017|publisher=''[[Huffington Post]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526020009/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-mcclanaghan/what-does-a-casting-direc_b_9799558.html|archivedate=May 26, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is on this panel as well. In the early stages of this process [[performers]] often may present, or are presented with prepared ''audition pieces'' such as [[monologue]]s, [[song]]s, choreography, scripts and or sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sides|url=http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|date=Feb 25, 2015|publisher=''[[Theatre Development Fund ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517122705/http://dictionary.tdf.org/sides/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These audition pieces are usually video taped, typically in the form of [[screen test]]s and then attached with resumes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How do I add my resume and more information about myself?|url=https://www.imdb.com/help/show_leaf?proaddresume|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[head shot]]s and or viewed online via websites such as [[IMDb]], then shared with film producers, film directors and or [[studio executive]]s. Later stages may involve groups of [[actors]] both union, ([[SAG-AFTRA]]) and non union depending on the size and scope of the production, attempting to read material from the work under consideration, paired off in various combinations of two, three or more. With each of the actor's overall [[motivational]] choices evaluated, the casting panel considers both the individual actor, and the ''chemistry'' created from either one of the combinations set forth within the [[read-through]], such as boy meets girl, etc.

Within the production of a prestigious work under consideration for film or television, and depending on the difficulty in finding a lead or supporting actor for the role, such as with the casting of the [[biopics|biopic]] films Notorious,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Notorious|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512175935/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0472198/|archivedate=May 12, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Straight Outta Compton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Straight Outta Compton - Number One Movie of the Summer|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|date=August 20, 2015|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307235934/https://socialbilitty.com/2015/08/straight-outta-compton-number-one-movie-of-the-summer/|archivedate=March 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and All Eyez on Me,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All Eyez on Me|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|date=June 16, 2017|publisher=''[[IMDb ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519114240/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1666185/|archivedate=May 19, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; casting calls may go out into the general public at large, this is referred to as a Cattle Call&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cattle Call|url=https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|date=December 15, 2016|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180213081649/https://socialbilitty.com/glossary/cattle-call/|archivedate=February 13, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (typical for [[community theater]]), to professional and semi-professional local actors where a similar process is followed (for supporting roles in [[theater]] and [[film]]) or for specifically selected actors (for leading roles, especially in films).

Casting character breakdowns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Write a Casting Notice|url=https://www.lightsfilmschool.com/blog/how-to-write-a-casting-call/481|date=April 2, 2013|publisher=''[[Lights Film School]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160321022431/http://www.lightsfilmschool.com/blog/how-to-write-a-casting-call/481/|archivedate=March 21, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to be confused with [[script breakdown]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Script Breakdown 101|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMep2s_T89c|date=Feb 18, 2016|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161225024006/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMep2s_T89c|archivedate=December 25, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; are often provided by production agents who submit their clients to casting, which provides a brief summary of character (age, gender, race or ethnicity, situations they may be involved in). A more robust version of this painstaking task can be made through the Breakdown Services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Services|url=https://www.breakdownservices.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517203341/http://www.breakdownservices.com/|archivedate=May 17, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was founded by former actor Gary Marsh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headshot Cafe interview with Gary Marsh (founder of Breakdown Services)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|date=Jul 8, 2013|publisher=''[[YouTube]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510155907/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwqFMEPVTpk|archivedate=May 10, 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Breakdown Services|url=https://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Services]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522044320/http://breakdownservices.com/index.cfm/main/about|archivedate=May 22, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; over 40 years ago. This was due to the difficult logistics issues for agents to get their actors submitted for acting roles from [[major film studio]]s and casting directors.

This casting breakdown service provides a complete character breakdown of various scripts and projects from production companies for film, television, [[print modeling|modeling]], commercials etc., to only agencies and managers who meet certain criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How can we contact casting directors or film directors in Hollywood as an aspiring actor?|url=https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-contact-casting-directors-or-film-directors-in-Hollywood-as-an-aspiring-actor/answer/Shaunti-Griffin?srid=hDjAD|date=May 12, 2017|publisher=''[[Quora]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These agents and managers are positioned all over the world, and subscribe to this service that literally has an entire suite of services for just about every aspect of the breakdown, for a monthly service subscription fee. This suite includes services such as Breakdown Express,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Breakdown Express|url=https://www.breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Breakdown Express ]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515155826/http://breakdownexpress.com/index.cfm|archivedate=May 15, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which offer representatives, casting and those who subscribe, a quicker way to post projects themselves. Another more limited version of the breakdown service, also for a monthly subscription fee is called Actors Access&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actors Access|url=http://www.actorsaccess.com/|date=May 18, 2017|publisher=''[[Actors Access]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520075705/http://www.actorsaccess.com/|archivedate=May 20, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where acting can subscribe to what is only made available to them, more like an entry level acting position, like [[under-five]], or a [[bit part]], a great tool for the actor whom is without an agent or manager.

An actor may go through several casting calls before receiving a part, and even though well known actors or actresses oftentimes still go through this very necessary process, some are privileged enough to have well known [[writer]]s, [[screenwriter]]s and or directors /producers [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] a project for their intent to be cast in a role. The well known actor or actress oftentimes negotiates producer [[Credit (creative arts)|credit]] as well as very lucrative monetary compensation.

Independent casting studios like Film Independent who hosts the annual [[Independent Spirit Awards]] and the [[Los Angeles Film Festival]] are often utilized for casting calls so that auditions can take place in one location, as well as possible affiliated various locations saving valuable time, energy and money. 

===What Casting Directors Actually Do===

For some major productions, the process of selecting actors for sometimes hundreds of speaking parts and roles, may often require a specialized staff. While the last word remains with the people in charge such as the director, producer, artistic departments and overall production team, a '''casting director'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twinkie Byrd - Casting in the 21st Century|url=https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|date=March 24, 2017|publisher=''[[Socialbilitty]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171214074029/https://socialbilitty.com/2017/03/twinkie-byrd-casting-in-the-21st-century/|archivedate=December 14, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "CD" (and sometimes the casting associate) is in charge of most of the daily work involved in this process during [[pre-production]]. A casting director is sometimes assisted by a casting associate; productions with large numbers of extras may have their own extras casting director as well, however in all aspects of a film or television production's budget, they are all a part of the [[Above-the-line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]], answering to the director as part of his or her staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Job Descriptions for Film, Video &amp; Cgi|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Job_Descriptions_for_Film_Video_Cgi.html?id=gv8MAAAACAAJ&amp;hl=en|date=May 21, 2017|publisher=''[[Google Books]]''|access-date=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "CD" remains as a liaison between director, actors and their agents/managers and the studio/network to get the [[character (arts)|character]]s in the script cast. Some casting directors build an impressive career working on numerous [[Hollywood]] productions such as [[Marion Dougherty]], [[Mary Jo Slater]], [[Mary Selway]], [[Lynn Stalmaster]], [[April Webster]], [[Tammara Billik]], [[Marci Liroff]], [[Avy Kaufman]], [[Mindy Marin]], and [[Robi Reed]].

At least in the early stages of casting and or extras casting such as with casting agency [[Central Casting]], the process may be decentralized geographically, often in conjunction with actual shooting planned in different locations. Another reason may be tapping into each home market in the case of an [[international co-production]]. However, for the top parts, the choice of one or more beautiful people, whose presence is of enormous commercial importance, may rather follow strictly personal channels, e.g. direct contact with the director. During this time known as the "attachment phase" of a film, the casting director's job is to send out copies of the current script to agents for what is known as coverage. Coverage is when a script yet to be cast is read, summarized into a one-pager, and a brief set of character descriptions established. At this time, if an agency agrees to give coverage to a film, they will submit a list of ideas to the casting directors of actors available, capable, and in the price range of the film. Also, casting directors create their own&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/182731144|title=Self-management for actors : getting down to (show) business|last=Bonnie.|first=Gillespie,|date=2009|publisher=Cricket Feet Pub|isbn=9780972301992|edition=3rd |location=Los Angeles, CA|oclc=182731144}}&lt;/ref&gt; idea lists and can "check avails" or call the actor representation to see if they are available and interested in taking on potential projects. If an idea that is generated from a casting director and a subsequent avail check or from an agent's recommendation is "approved" by the director, producers, and financiers (or studio), the casting director sends out what is called an "Offer." The offer, usually contains a letter to the actor's representative explaining the role in question, a copy of the script, why the actor has been selected, the length of time commitment, the approximate start date of filming, the filming location, and the proposed salary offering. If the actor does not respond to the material or for whatever reason cannot accept the job, they respond to casting with what is called a "pass." If they accept the offer, the agent engages the casting director and a deal memo is sent from casting to the representative. It is at this time when negotiations between agency and production happen to finalize any deal points before the entertainment lawyers step in and draw up the attachment contracts. If this process happens very early on in the development of a movie but the official shoot dates and details are not yet known, a Letter of Intent or "LOI" is drafted, to indicate, if and when the project is "green lit" or begins active production, the actor is already hired to portray that particular role. 

After the attachment phase is complete (which depends on many factors -- including but not limited to: financial backers, studio heads, availability of other above the line personnel), the physical auditions begin for all of the remaining roles. During this time, depending on the budget of the film, they could have what is called "pre-screens" where you audition only for a casting director (or associate) to see if the actor is right for the material. After pre-screens would be a "director session", during this time the actor comes in and auditions (usually with the same material) and now performs for the casting director and the film director. If there is a next step, it is usually a "callback" or producer session, where anyone who has decision making power is in the room for your audition. In television, this phase is referred to as a "screen test" and Network Executives would also be in attendance.  Once actors are selected from the pool of available actors, the same booking process that happens in the attachment phase takes place for any actor except extras.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

The resulting list of actors who were selected to play a [[Character (arts)|character]] for a production, is called a [[cast list]], which is incorporated into a [[production company]]'s [[daily call sheet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the Call Sheet on a film production?|url=https://www.pinterest.com/pin/AdHVgcm6ShVa0O6QBzSKUyej3F9s9hbwxymib5y-vI4CPDpfvYfevQI/|date=September 8, 2016|publisher=''[[Pinterest]]''|access-date=May 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reflected in the projects [[title sequence]] especially with film and television.

=== Casting Office Personnel ===
'''Readers:''' This person reads all other character's lines opposite the actor who is currently auditioning. A good reader is someone who has acting skills, but who has no interest in booking a role through that casting director's office at that time. A reader will know how to give and take and play with other actors without ever outshining the auditioning actors.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; 

'''Interns:''' Interns are more common to commercial casting offices which host as many as a dozen different casting directors holding different auditions per day. While some commercial casting offices hold permanent casting space, many rent out studios on a project to project basis. A key intern will work with many busy casting directors sorting mail, copying sides and transcribing them onto "cue cards" or large boards to be read off of as prompts in the casting room, help actors sign in, and keep the flow of actors going in and out of the casting room as smooth as possible.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

'''Casting Assistants:''' This is the entry level position in the field of casting. These people go above and beyond the call of duty of your typical office assistant. They do everything from covering phones, to making copies, setting up audition (aka "session") equipment like lights, the camera, sound equipment, etc. They sometimes can be found in the office relaying audition appointments, checking actors avails, or in the casting room making sure the recording software is running smoothly so the Casting Director can focus on each actor's performance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

'''Casting Associates:''' Associates is the second [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] in a casting office. Once a casting associate has worked for two years in the field of casting, they can apply for membership in [[Casting Society of America]]. Typically, the work under a Casting Director running pre-read sessions, prepping deal memos, and doing any calls to agents. Many associates begin to take on smaller scale projects so they can amass enough credits to move up in rank in CSA to a full-fledged Casting Director.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Casting Director:''' Their job is to know a lot about a lot of actors, so that they can advise and present to the director the best of the existing possibilities. Casting directors are highly influential and is usually on the project because the director trusts their judgements. They are also the ones who decides who the director does see. Good casting directors "discover" actor by carefully setting it up so that the director and producer will feel as if they've made the discovery of the new young actor. On the occasion when the director or producer does not respond to the actor presented, they must keep in mind that they aren't directing the production, the director is the one who's going to have to work with that actor-- therefore, it is casting's responsibility to delicately balance between showcasing the actor available to them and the director and producer's sensibilities, tastes, and expectations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/47813908|title=Audition : everything an actor needs to know to get the part|last=Michael.|first=Shurtleff,|date=1980|orig-year=1978|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=0553272950|edition=Bantam |location=New York|oclc=47813908}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Artios Awards]] ===
The highest honor a casting director can receive is awarded by their peers in the [[Casting Society of America]]. ''Artios'', comes from the Greek word meaning, "perfectly fitted." The Artios award excellence in casting for all genres of casting except commercials. The Artios are currently held mid-January annually with ceremonies in New York, Los Angeles, and (beginning in 2018) London. Since their incarnation in 1985, they were held in November but were moved in 2013-2014 season to align with the rest of the film and television industry's awards season.

[[Image:Paper-cut.jpg|thumb|A Paper cut "window flower" during [[Chinese New Year]]]]

The art of paper cutting (''jiǎnzhǐ'' 剪纸) in China may date back to the second century a.c., since [[paper]] was invented by [[Cai Lun]] in the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] in [[China]]. As paper became more affordable, paper-cutting became one of the most important types of Chinese folk art. Later, this art form spread to other parts of the world, with different regions adopting their own cultural styles.  Because the cut-outs are often used to decorate doors and windows, they are sometimes referred to as '''chuāng huā''' (窗花), '''window flowers''' or '''window paper-cuts'''. People glued the papercuts to the exterior of windows, so the light from the inside would shine through the negative space of the cutout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=CROSS-CULTURAL EXPERIENCES THROUGH AN EXHIBITION IN CHINA AND SWITZERLAND: "THE ART OF PAPER-CUTTING: EAST MEETS WEST"|jstor=23208592|journal=Source: Notes in the History of Art|date=2012-04-01|pages=29–35|volume=31|issue=3|first=Crystal Hui-Shu|last=Yang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the artworks are made of red paper, as red is associated with festivities and happiness in Chinese culture, but other colours were also used. Normally paper-cutting artwork is used on festivals like [[Chinese New Year|Spring Festival]], weddings and childbirth. Papercuts always symbolize luck and happiness.

==Origin==
Chinese paper-cutting originated from ancient activities of worshipping ancestors and gods, and is a traditional part of Chinese culture. According to archaeological records, it originates from the 6th century, although some believe that its history could be traced as far back as the [[Warring States period]] (around 3 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/subview/25552/7526411.htm?fr=aladdin|title=中国剪纸|accessdate=2017-06-09|language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt; long before the paper was invented. At that time, people used other thin materials, like leaves, [[silver foil]], [[silk]] and even [[leather]], to carve hollowed patterns. Later, when paper was invented, people realized that this material was easy to cut, store and discard, and paper became the major material for this type of artwork. During the [[Ming]] and [[Qing]] dynasties (1368–1912), this artistry witnessed its most prosperous period. For over a thousand years, people (mainly women) have been making paper-cuts as part a leisure activity. They created different type of paper-cutting and shared and passed this traditional craftsmanship to their children, so that this traditional art style became more and more popular and is still practiced to this day.

Paper is a kind of material which [[mildew]]s and rots easily. In the southeast of China, it usually rains in May and June, which makes paper mildew and rot quickly. As a result, people in southeast did not keep them, and it is hard to find paper-cutting from that time. On the contrast, the weather in the northwest of China is usually dry, which makes it possible to find paper-cutting made in the [[Northern dynasties]] in [[Turpan]], [[Sinkiang]] province.

When paper-cutting passed down to the [[Tang dynasty]], the skills of handcraft became mature. Paper-cutting was not only a kind of handcraft, but also a piece of artwork, as it could express the idea through the pattern. In Ming and Qing dynasty, paper-cutting experienced its peak development. Folk paper-cutting spread to a wider range and had abundant means of artistic expression. Paper-cutting was used to decorate doors, windows and walls to show happiness and festival.

==Classification==
Paper-cutting is one of the oldest and the most popular [[folk art]]s in China. It can be geographically divided into a southern and a northern style. The southern style, represented by works from [[Yangzhou]] in [[Jiangsu Province]] and [[Leqing]] in [[Zhejiang Province]], features ingenious and beautiful designs, exquisite carving and interesting shapes. The northern style, mainly from [[Yu County, Hebei|Yuxian]] and [[Fengning]] in [[Hebei Province]] and best represented by works from northern [[Shaanxi]], features exaggerated shapes, vigorousness, vivid depictions and diverse patterns.

The style of window paper-cuts is usually free, except the flower pattern on the corner. The theme of window paper-cuts has a wide range, the most popular of which is based on the stories of traditional [[Chinese opera]]. As most buyers are farmers, the content of window paper-cut usually describe farming, spinning, fishing and poultry farming.

==Symmetry==
[[Image:TibetanDance.png|thumb|right|200px|A Symmetrical cut]]
There are basic cut-outs, consisting of a single image, and symmetrical designs, that are usually created by some folding over a proportioned crease, and then cutting a shape, so that when unfolded, it forms a symmetrical design. Chinese paper cuttings are usually symmetrical. The paper cut outs are usually in an even number series of 2, 4, 24 etc.

==Uses==
Today, paper cuttings are chiefly decorative. They liven up walls, windows, doors, columns, mirrors, lamps and lanterns in homes and are also used on presents or are given as gifts themselves. Paper cut-outs pasted on or near entrances are supposed to bring good luck. Paper cuttings used to be used as patterns, especially for [[embroidery]]  and [[lacquer]] work. Papercuts are used by younger generation as a decoration for their kits and books.

Paper-cutting was and is mostly used as a decoration, or an aesthetic way to express people's hopes, gratitude and other emotions. With a pair of scissors cutting through a piece of red paper, the paper-cuttings are endowed with a simple but exaggerated beauty. The vividly depicted paper-cuttings have different meanings. Some express the wish for a harvest or a wealthy life, such as paper-cuttings of a golden harvest, thriving domestic animals, good fortunes, a surplus year or a carp jumping over a dragon gate (a traditional Chinese story, indicating a leap towards a better life); some depict animals and plants, such as paper-cuttings of polecats, lions, kylins (Chinese mythical creature), jade rabbits (animal from a Chinese legend), pomegranates and peonies; some illustrate legendary figures or scenes from traditional myths or stories, such as paper-cuttings of the Yellow Emperor, the meeting of Niulang and Zhinv and 24 stories of filial piety; and others show people's gratitude towards life, such as paper-cuttings of a doll with two twisted hair on each side of the head, fish swimming through lotus and dishes. (a strong passion for life can be easily seen from the paper-cuttings of the women)

The most famous paper-cutting characters in Chinese are “福” (''fú'', meaning 'lucky') and “囍” (xǐ, meaning 'double happiness'). Even to this day, Chinese people love to hang paper-cutting of these two characters at their doors. “福” is usually used during the Chinese New Year's Festival, indicating people's wishes for a lucky year. “囍” can often be seen at the windows or door of newly-weds.

Window paper-cuts have a close relationship with Spring begins, as it has been a way to welcome spring since ancient times in China. In many areas in China, especially in North, when spring comes, people like to paste window paper-cuts on the window to express their happiness. Since Song and [[Yuan Dynasty]], people change the time to the Spring Festival in order to welcome Chinese New Year. Through pasting window paper-cuts, people decorate their home to show their joy, happiness and good intentions.

==Process==
There are two methods of manufacture: one uses scissors, the other uses knives. In the scissor method, several pieces of paper&amp;nbsp;— up to eight&amp;nbsp;— are fastened together. The motif is then cut with sharp, pointed scissors.

Knife cuttings are fashioned by putting several layers of paper on a relatively soft foundation consisting of a mixture of [[tallow]] and ashes. Following a pattern, the artist cuts the motif into the paper with a sharp knife which is usually held vertically. Skilled crafters can even cut out different drawings freely without stopping.

The '''Cider Mill Playhouse''' in [[Endicott, New York]], was a professional theater producing comedies, dramas and musicals.  It was a member of the [[Theatre Communications Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcg.org/about/membership/member_list.cfm|title=TCG Member Theatres|last=|first=|date=|publisher=[[Theatre Communications Group]]|accessdate=2010-02-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813033643/http://www.tcg.org/about/membership/member_list.cfm|archivedate=2012-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and operated as a Small Professional Theatre, Level 5, by annual contract with Actors' Equity Association.

== History ==
In the early 1970s, [[Binghamton University]] (then known as "SUNY B") professor and soon to be theater department chairman, Dr. John Bielenberg sought to expand the theater department venue to an off-campus site, first, to enhance "town-gown" presence, and second, and most important, to give the department's students more opportunities to practice and hone their craft.

In 1991, after funding from the university was withdrawn, Cider Mill Playhouse incorporates as a 501c3 charitable organization which it remains today. 

After operating as a semi-professional theater for many years, Cider Mill Playhouse became an "Equity house" professional theater as of December 21, 2015 under the artistic leadership of Gail King Belokur.

== Facility ==
Dr. Bielenberg and his colleagues found The Cider Mill, an apple warehouse on South Nanticoke in the Village of Endicott. After some discussions, Mill owner Orlando Ciotoli agreed and, on a handshake, the Playhouse was launched.

== Productions ==

===Early Productions===
Early productions included  ''[[Company (musical)|Company]]'', ''[[Sleuth (play)|Sleuth]]'', ''Night Must Fall'', ''[[A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum]]'', ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', ''[[Whose Life Is It Anyway? (play)|Whose Life Is It Anyway]]'', ''[[Da (play)|Da]]'', ''[[Agnes of God]]'', ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'', ''The Last meeting of the Knights of the White Magnolia'', and others.
"The professional nature of the theater was all important to us," recalled Dr. John Bielenberg, now-retired BU Theater Department Chairman. "The students were able to work with the professionals, whom we hired as actors and directors, in an atmosphere that they would find in their theater careers." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= |title=Cider Mill Re-Opens |author=Grey, Gene |date=October 1, 1992 |work= |publisher=Press and Sun Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== A Christmas Carol ===
Cider Mill mounts an annual production of Charles Dickens' [[A Christmas Carol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcg.org/about/membership/member_list.cfm|title=Cider Mill Playhouse presents 'A Christmas Carol'|last=Post|first=Wendy|date=2009-12-13|publisher=[[Owego (town), New York|Owego]] Penny Saver|accessdate=2010-02-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813033643/http://www.tcg.org/about/membership/member_list.cfm|archivedate=2012-08-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting in 1982, Cider Mill Playhouse produced its own musical version of the story which was copyrighted by founder John Bielenberg. After many years and revisions, the final version of this production was produced in 2015. Beginning in 2016, a new adaptation was produced to address copyright issues that had developed. This version expanded the cast to include a combination of paid professionals and a volunteer community ensemble, which embodies the commitment Cider Mill Playhouse to continue work by professionals while providing opportunities for community theatre involvement.

'''Disgust''' is an [[emotion]]al response of rejection or revulsion to something potentially contagious&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Badour|first=Christal|last2=Feldner|first2=Matthew|date=February 2016|title=The Role of Disgust in Posttraumatic Stress: A Critical Review of the Empirical Literature|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5127/pr.032813|journal=Psychopathology Review|volume=|pages=2|doi=10.5127/pr.032813|issn=2051-8315|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; or something considered offensive, distasteful, or unpleasant. In ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]]'', [[Charles Darwin]] wrote that disgust is a sensation that refers to something revolting. Disgust is experienced primarily in relation to the [[sense]] of [[taste]] (either perceived or imagined), and secondarily to anything which causes a similar feeling by sense of [[Olfaction|smell]], [[Somatosensory system|touch]], or [[Visual perception|vision]]. Musically sensitive people may even be disgusted by the [[cacophony]] of inharmonious sounds. Research continually has proven a relationship between disgust and [[anxiety disorder]]s such as [[arachnophobia]], [[blood-injection-injury type phobia]]s, and contamination fear related [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (also known as OCD).&lt;ref name="Cisler2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cisler|first=J.M.|author2=Olatunji, B.O. |author3=Lohr, J.M. |author4=Williams, N.L. |title=Attentional bias differences between fear and disgust: Implications for the role of disgust in disgust-related anxiety disorders|journal=Cognition and Emotion|year=2009|volume=23|pages=675–687|doi=10.1080/02699930802051599|pmid=20589224|issue=4|pmc=2892866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disgust is one of the basic emotions of [[Robert Plutchik]]'s theory of emotions and has been studied extensively by [[Paul Rozin]]. It invokes a characteristic facial expression, one of [[Paul Ekman]]'s six universal facial expressions of emotion. Unlike the emotions of [[fear]], [[anger]], and [[sadness]], disgust is associated with a decrease in heart rate.&lt;ref&gt;Rozin P, Haidt J, &amp; McCauley C.R. (2000) Disgust In M. Lewis &amp; J.M. Haviland-Jones (Eds) Handbook of Emotions, 2nd Edition (pp637- 653). New York: [[Guilford Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Emotion}}

== Evolutionary significance ==
It is believed that the emotion of disgust has evolved as a response to offensive foods that may cause harm to the organism.&lt;ref name="Wicker"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wicker | first1 = B. | last2 = Keysers | first2 = C. | last3 = Plailly | first3 = J. | last4 = Royet | first4 = J. P. | last5 = Gallese | first5 = V. | last6 = Rizzolatti | first6 = G. | year = 2003 | title = Both of us disgusted in my insula: the common neural basis of seeing and feeling disgust | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 40 | issue = 3| pages = 655–64 | doi = 10.1016/S0896-6273(03)00679-2 | pmid = 14642287 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A common example of this is found in human beings who show disgust reactions to mouldy [[milk]] or contaminated meat.  Disgust appears to be triggered by objects or people who possess attributes that signify disease.&lt;ref name = "Oaten"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Oaten | first1 = M. | last2 = Stevenson | first2 = R. J. | last3 = Case | first3 = T. I. | year = 2009 | title = Disgust as a Disease-Avoidance Mechanism | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 135 | issue = 2| pages = 303–321 | doi=10.1037/a0014823 | pmid=19254082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Self-report and behavioural studies found that disgust elicitors include:
* body products ([[feces]], urine, [[vomiting|vomit]], sexual fluids, [[saliva]], and [[mucus]]);
* foods (spoiled foods);
* animals (fleas, ticks, lice, cockroaches, worms, flies, rats, and mice);
* hygiene (visible dirt and "inappropriate" acts [e.g., using an unsterilized surgical instrument]);
* body envelope violations (blood, gore, and mutilation);
* death (dead bodies and organic decay);
* visible signs of infection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curtis | first1 = V. | last2 = Biran | first2 = A. | year = 2001 | title = Dirt, disgust, and disease: Is hygiene in our genes? | url = | journal = Perspectives in Biology and Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 17–31 | doi = 10.1353/pbm.2001.0001 | pmid = 11253302 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above-mentioned main disgust stimuli are similar to one another in the sense that they can all potentially transmit infections, and are the most common referenced elicitors of disgust cross-culturally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Curtis | first1 = V. | year = 2007 | title = Dirt, disease, and disgust: A natural history of hygiene | url = | journal = Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health | volume = 61 | issue = 8| pages = 660–664 | doi = 10.1136/jech.2007.062380 | pmid = 17630362 | pmc = 2652987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, disgust is believed to have evolved as a component of a behavioral immune system in which the body attempts to avoid disease-carrying [[pathogens]] in preference to fighting them after they have entered the body. This [[behavioral immune system]] has been found to make sweeping generalizations because "it is more costly to perceive a sick person as healthy than to perceive a healthy person as sickly".&lt;ref&gt;Schaller, M., &amp; Duncan, L. A. (2007). The behavioral immune system: Its evolution and social psychological implications. In J. P. Forgas, M. G. Haselton, &amp; W. von Hippel (Eds.), Evolution and the social mind: Evolutionary psychology and social cognition (pp. 293–307). New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have found that sensitivity to disgust is negatively correlated to aggression because feelings of disgust typically bring about a need to withdraw{{clarify|date=October 2016}} while aggression results in a need to approach.&lt;ref name="Pond2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pond | first1 = R. S. | last2 = DeWall | first2 = C. N. | last3 = Lambert | first3 = N. M. | last4 = Deckman | first4 = T. | last5 = Bonser | first5 = I. M. | last6 = Fincham | first6 = F. D. | year = 2012 | title = Repulsed by violence: Disgust sensitivity buffers trait, behavioral, and daily aggression | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 102 | issue = 1| pages = 175–188 | doi = 10.1037/a0024296 | pmid = 21707194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be explained in terms of each of the types of disgust. For those especially sensitive to moral disgust, they would want to be less aggressive because they want to avoid hurting others. Those especially sensitive to pathogen disgust might be motivated by a desire to avoid the possibility of an open wound on the victim of the aggression; however, for those sensitive to sexual disgust, some sexual object must be present for them to be especially avoidant of aggression.&lt;ref name="Pond2012" /&gt; Based on these findings, disgust may be used as an emotional tool to decrease aggression in individuals. Disgust may produce specific [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]] responses, such as reduced blood pressure, lowered heart-rate and decreased skin conductance along with changes in respiratory behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ritz | first1 = T. | last2 = Thons | first2 = M. | last3 = Fahrenkrug | first3 = S. | last4 = Dahme | first4 = B. | year = 2005 | title = Airways, respiration, and [[respiratory sinus arrhythmia]] during picture viewing | url = | journal = Psychophysiology | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 568–578 | pmid = 16176379 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-8986.2005.00312.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research has also found that people who are more sensitive to disgust tend to find their own in-group more attractive and tend to have more negative attitudes toward other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.12.001 | pmid = | title = Disease avoidance and ethnocentrism: The effects of disease vulnerability and disgust sensitivity on intergroup attitudes | year = 2006 | last1 = Navarrete | first1 = Carlos David | last2 = Fessler | first2 = Daniel M.T. | journal = Evolution and Human Behavior | volume = 27 | issue = 4 | pages = 270–282  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be explained by assuming that people begin to associate outsiders and foreigners with disease and danger while simultaneously associating health, freedom from disease, and safety with people similar to themselves.

Taking a further look into hygiene, disgust was the strongest predictor of negative attitudes toward obese individuals. A disgust reaction to obese individuals was also connected with views of moral values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ijo.2010.45 | pmid =20195287 | title = Disgust and perceived control in attitudes toward obese people | year = 2010 | last1 = Vartanian | first1 = L R | journal = International Journal of Obesity | volume = 34 | issue = 8 | pages = 1302–7  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domains of disgust===
{{See also|Evolution of morality}}
Tybur, et al., outlines three domains of disgust: ''pathogen disgust'', which "motivates the avoidance of infectious microorganisms"; ''sexual disgust'', "which motivates the avoidance of [dangerous] sexual partners and behaviors"; and ''moral disgust'', which motivates people to avoid breaking [[social norms]]. Disgust may have an important role in certain forms of morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyber|first=J. M.|author2=Lieberman, D. |author3=Griskevicius, V. |title=Microbes, mating, and morality: Individual differences in three functional domains of disgust|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=97|pages=103–22|doi=10.1037/a0015474|pmid=19586243|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pathogen disgust]] arises from a desire to survive and, ultimately, a fear of death. He compares it to a "behavioral immune system" that is the 'first line of defense' against potentially deadly agents such as dead bodies, rotting food, and vomit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyber|first=J. M.|author2=Lieberman, D. |author3=Griskevicius, V. |title=Microbes, mating, and morality: Individual differences in three functional domains of disgust|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=97|page=105|doi=10.1037/a0015474|pmid=19586243|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual disgust arises from a desire to avoid "biologically costly mates" and a consideration of the consequences of certain reproductive choices. The two primary considerations are intrinsic quality (e.g., body symmetry, facial attractiveness, etc.) and genetic compatibility (e.g., avoidance of [[inbreeding]] such as the [[incest taboo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyber|first=J. M.|author2=Lieberman, D. |author3=Griskevicius, V. |title=Microbes, mating, and morality: Individual differences in three functional domains of disgust|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=97|page=106|doi=10.1037/a0015474|pmid=19586243|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moral disgust "pertains to social transgressions" and may include behaviors such as lying, theft, murder, and rape. Unlike the other two domains, moral disgust "motivates avoidance of social relationships with norm-violating individuals" because those relationships threaten group cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyber|first=J. M.|author2=Lieberman, D. |author3=Griskevicius, V. |title=Microbes, mating, and morality: Individual differences in three functional domains of disgust|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=97|page=107|doi=10.1037/a0015474|pmid=19586243|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender differences ===
Women generally report greater disgust than men, especially regarding sexual disgust or general repulsiveness which have been argued to be consistent with women being more selective regarding sex for evolutionary reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0191-8869(98)00196-2 | last1 = Druschel | first1 = B. A. | last2 = Sherman | first2 = M. F. | year = 1999 | title = Disgust sensitivity as a function of the Big Five and gender | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 739–748 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sensitivity to disgust rises during pregnancy, along with levels of the hormone [[progesterone]]. Scientists have conjectured that pregnancy requires the mother to "dial down" her immune system so that the developing embryo won't be attacked. To protect the mother, this lowered immune system is then compensated by a heightened sense of disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Survival’s Ick Factor|date=23 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/24/science/disgusts-evolutionary-role-is-irresistible-to-researchers.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because disgust is an emotion with physical responses to undesirable or dirty situations, studies have proven there are cardiovascular and respiratory changes while experiencing the emotion of disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2010.09.014 | pmid =20888886 | title = Bradygastric activity of the stomach predicts disgust sensitivity and perceived disgust intensity | year = 2011 | last1 = Meissner | first1 = Karin | last2 = Muth | first2 = Eric R. | last3 = Herbert | first3 = Beate M. | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 86 | pages = 9–16 | issue = 1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As mentioned earlier, women experience disgust more prominently than men. This is reflected in a study about dental phobia. A dental phobia comes from experiencing disgust when thinking about the dentist and all that entails. 4.6 percent of women compared to 2.7 percent of men find the dentist disgusting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2011.08.010 | pmid =21889569 | title = Frontal late positivity in dental phobia: A study on gender differences | year = 2011 | last1 = Schienle | first1 = Anne | last2 = Köchel | first2 = Angelika | last3 = Leutgeb | first3 = Verena | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 88 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 263–9  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Body language ==
In a series of significant studies by [[Paul Ekman]] in the 1970s, it was discovered that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal across human cultures and thus likely to be biological in origin.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Jamie. (2006).'' The Student’s Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience''. New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The facial expression of disgust was found to be one of these facial expressions. This characteristic facial expression includes slightly narrowed brows, a curled upper lip, wrinkling of the nose and visible protrusions of the tongue, although different elicitors may produce different forms of this expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rozin | first1 = P. | last2 = Lowery | first2 = L. | last3 = Ebert | first3 = R. | year = 1994 | title = Varieties of disgust faces and the structure of disgust | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 5| pages = 870–881 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.66.5.870 | pmid = 8014832 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was found that the facial expression of disgust is readily recognizable across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Eckman, P., Friesen, W. V., &amp; Ellsworth, P. (1972). ''Emotion in the human face: Guidelines for research and an integration of findings''. New York: Pergamon&lt;/ref&gt; This facial expression is also produced in blind individuals and is correctly interpreted by individuals born deaf.&lt;ref name = "Oaten" /&gt; This evidence indicates an innate biological basis for the expression and recognition of disgust. The recognition of disgust is also important among species as it has been found that when an individual sees a conspecific looking disgusted after tasting a particular food, he or she automatically infers that the food is bad and should not be eaten.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt; This evidence suggests that disgust is experienced and recognized almost universally and strongly implicates its evolutionary significance.

[[Facial feedback hypothesis|Facial feedback]] has also been implicated in the expression of disgust. That is, the making of the facial expression of disgust leads to an increased feeling of disgust. This can occur if the person just wrinkles one's nose without awareness that they are making a disgust expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Exploring the positive and negative implications of facial feedback.|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/emo/12/4/852/|website = APA PsycNET|accessdate = 2015-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mirror-neuron matching system found in monkeys and humans is a proposed explanation for such recognition, and shows that our internal representation of actions is triggered during the observation of another’s actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kohler  | year = 2002 | title = Hearing sounds, understanding actions: action representation in mirror neurons | url = | journal = Science | volume = 297 | issue = 5582| pages = 846–848 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1126/science.1070311 | pmid = 12161656 | first1 = E | last2 = Keysers | first2 = C | last3 = Umiltà | first3 = MA | last4 = Fogassi | first4 = L | last5 = Gallese | first5 = V | last6 = Rizzolatti | first6 = G }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been demonstrated that a similar mechanism may apply to emotions. Seeing someone else's facial emotional expressions triggers the neural activity that would relate to our own experience of the same emotion.&lt;ref name = "Sprengelmeyer"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprengelmeyer | first1 = R | last2 = Rausch | first2 = M | last3 = Eysel | first3 = U. T. | last4 = Przuntek | first4 = H.  | year = 1998 | title = Neural structures associated with recognition of facial expressions of basic emotions | url = | journal = Biological Sciences | volume = 265 | issue = 1409| pages = 1927–1931 | pmid = 9821359 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.1998.0522 | pmc = 1689486 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This points to the universality, as well as survival value of the emotion of disgust.

===Children's reactions to a face showing disgust===
At a very young age, children are able to identify different, basic facial emotions. If a parent makes a negative face and a positive emotional face toward two different toys, a child as young as five months would avoid the toy associated with a negative face. Young children tend to associate a face showing disgust with anger instead of being able to identify the difference. Adults, however, are able to make the distinction. The age of understanding seems to be around ten years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/02699930801949090 | pmid = | title = ''Production of'' spontaneous and posed facial expressions in patients with Huntington's disease: Impaired communication of disgust | year = 2009 | last1 = Hayes | first1 = Catherine J. | last2 = Stevenson | first2 = Richard J. | last3 = Coltheart | first3 = Max | journal = Cognition &amp; Emotion | volume = 23 | pages = 118–134  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural differences==
Because disgust is partially a result of social conditioning, there are differences among different cultures in the objects of disgust. Americans "are more likely to link feelings of disgust to actions that limit a person's rights or degrade a person's dignity" while Japanese people "are more likely to link feelings of disgust to actions that frustrate their integration into the social world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/097133369700900105 | pmid = | title = Body, Psyche, and Culture: The Relationship between Disgust and Morality | year = 1997 | last1 = Haidt | first1 = J. | last2 = Rozin | first2 = P. | last3 = McCauley | first3 = C. | last4 = Imada | first4 = S. | journal = Psychology &amp; Developing Societies | volume = 9 | pages = 107–131  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Practices construed as socially acceptable, may also be met with reactions of aversion by other cultures. For example, instead of kissing, mothers from the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] minority ethnic group, as only researched in the 1900s in [[Aigun]] of [[Outer Manchuria|Northern Manchuria]] where the researcher [[S. M. Shirokogoroff]] personally believed the Manchu element were "purer" than those of Southern Manchuria and Peking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Laufer|first = B.|date = 1924|title = Book Reviews|jstor = 661399|journal = American Anthropologist|volume = 26| issue  = |pages = 540| quote = The author's researches were made at Aigun in northern Manchuria where the Manchu element is preserved in a purer form and less influenced by Chinese than in southern Manchuria and Peking.| doi  = }}&lt;/ref&gt; used to show affection for their children by performing [[fellatio]] on their male babies, placing the penis in their mouths and stimulating it, while the Manchu regarded public kissing with revulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Clarke | first=John R. | title=Looking at Lovemaking | year=2001 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bwNdgd8cQcgC | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley | isbn=978-0-520-22904-4 | pages=15–16 | edition=1st paperback print | quote=In the Manchu tribe, a mother will routinely suck her small son's penis in public but would never kiss his cheeks.

Disgust is one of the basic emotions recognizable across multiple cultures and is a response to something revolting typically involving taste or sight. Though different cultures find different things disgusting, the reaction to the grotesque things remains the same throughout each culture; people and their emotional reactions in the realm of disgust remain the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jrp.2008.03.009 | pmid = | title = Core, animal reminder, and contamination disgust: Three kinds of disgust with distinct personality, behavioral, physiological, and clinical correlates | year = 2008 | last1 = Olatunji | first1 = Bunmi O. | last2 = Haidt | first2 = Jonathan | last3 = McKay | first3 = Dean | last4 = David | first4 = Bieke | journal = Journal of Research in Personality | volume = 42 | issue = 5 | pages = 1243–1259  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural basis==
The scientific attempts to map specific emotions onto underlying neural substrates dates back to the first half of the 20th century. 
[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|Functional MRI]] experiments have revealed that the [[insular cortex|anterior insula]] in the brain is particularly active when experiencing disgust, when being exposed to offensive tastes, and when viewing facial expressions of disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips | first1 = ML | last2 = Young | first2 = AW | last3 = Senior | first3 = C | last4 = Brammer | first4 = M | last5 = Andrew | first5 = C | last6 = Calder | first6 = AJ | last7 = Bullmore | first7 = ET | last8 = Perrett | first8 = DI | last9 = Rowland | first9 = D | last10 = Williams | first10 = S.

===Insula===
[[File:Gray731.png|thumb|The insula of the left side, exposed by removing the opercula. From [[Henry Vandyke Carter]] - [[Henry Gray]] (1918) Anatomy of the Human Body Bartleby.com: Gray's Anatomy, Plate 731]]The '''insula''' (or [[insular cortex]]), is the main neural structure involved in the emotion of disgust.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sprengelmeyer" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Calder"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calder  | year = 2000 | title = Impaired recognition and experience of disgust following brain injury | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 11| pages = 1077–1088 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1038/80586 | first1 = Andrew J. | last2 = Keane | first2 = Jill | last3 = Manes | first3 = Facundo | last4 = Antoun | first4 = Nagui | last5 = Young | first5 = Andrew W. | pmid=11036262}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insula has been shown by several studies to be the main neural correlate of the feeling of disgust both in humans and in macaque monkeys. The insula is activated by unpleasant tastes, smells, and the visual recognition of disgust in [[conspecific]] organisms.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt;

The '''anterior insula''' is an [[olfactory]] and [[gustatory]] center that controls [[visceral]] sensations and the related autonomic responses.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt; It also receives visual information from the anterior portion of the ventral superior temporal cortex, where cells have been found to respond to the sight of faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keysers | first1 = C. | last2 = Xiao | first2 = D. K. | last3 = Foldiak | first3 = P. | last4 = Perrett | first4 = D. I. | year = 2001 | title = The speed of sight | url = | journal = Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 90–101 | doi = 10.1162/089892901564199 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''posterior insula''' is characterized by connections with [[Auditory system|auditory]], [[somatosensory]], and [[premotor]] areas, and is not related to the olfactory or gustatory modalities.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt;

The fact that the insula is necessary for our ability to feel and  recognize the emotion of disgust is further supported by neuropsychological studies. Both  Calder (2000) and Adolphs (2003) showed that lesions on the anterior insula lead to deficits in the experience of disgust and recognizing facial expressions of disgust in others.&lt;ref name = "Calder" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adolphs  | year = 2003 | title = Dissociable neural systems for recognizing emotions | url = | journal = Brain Cognition | volume = 52 | issue = 1| pages = 61–69 | display-authors = 1 | doi = 10.1016/S0278-2626(03)00009-5 | pmid = 12812805 | first1 = Ralph | last2 = Tranel | first2 = Daniel | last3 = Damasio | first3 = Antonio R. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The patients also reported having reduced sensations of disgust themselves. Furthermore, electrical stimulation of the anterior insula conducted during neurosurgery triggered nausea, the feeling of wanting to throw up and uneasiness in the stomach. Finally, electrically stimulating the anterior insula through implanted electrodes produced sensations in the throat and mouth that were "difficult to stand".&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt; These findings demonstrate the role of the insula in transforming unpleasant sensory input into physiological reactions, and the associated feeling of disgust.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt;

Studies have demonstrated that the insula is activated by disgusting stimuli, and that observing someone else's facial expression of disgust seems to automatically retrieve a neural representation of disgust.&lt;ref name="Wicker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stark | first1 = R. | last2 = Zimmermann | first2 = M. | last3 = Kagerer | first3 = S. | last4 = Schienle | first4 = A. | last5 = Walter | first5 = B. | year = 2007 | title = Hemodynamic brain correlates of disgust and fear ratings | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 37 | issue = 2| pages = 663–673 | doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2007.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, these findings emphasize the role of the insula in feelings of disgust.

One particular neuropsychological study focused on patient NK who was diagnosed with a left hemisphere infarction involving the insula, internal
capsule, putamen and globus pallidus. NK’s neural damage included the insula and [[putamen]] and it was found that NK’s overall response to disgust-inducing stimuli was significantly lower than that of controls.&lt;ref name = "Calder" /&gt; The patient showed a reduction in disgust-response on eight categories including food, animals, body  products, envelope violation and death.&lt;ref name = "Calder" /&gt; Moreover, NK incorrectly categorized disgust facial expressions as anger. The results of this study support the idea that NK suffered damage to a system involved in recognizing social signals of disgust, due to a damaged insula caused by neurodegeneration.&lt;ref name = "Calder" /&gt;

==Disorders==

===Huntington's disease===
Many patients suffering from [[Huntington's disease]], a genetically transmitted progressive neurodegenerative disease, are unable to recognize expressions of disgust in others and also don't show reactions of disgust to foul odors or tastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.17.1.119 | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = IJ | last2 = Heims | first2 = H | last3 = Neville | first3 = EA | last4 = Rickards | first4 = H | title = Huntington's disease patients show impaired perception of disgust in the gustatory and olfactory modalities | url = http://neuro.psychiatryonline.org/doi/abs/10.1176/jnp.17.1.119 | journal = The Journal of neuropsychiatry and clinical neurosciences | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 119–21 | year = 2005 | pmid=15746492}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inability to recognize expressions of disgust appears in carriers of the Huntington gene before other symptoms appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprengelmeyer | first1 = R | last2 = Schroeder | first2 = U | last3 = Young | first3 = AW | last4 = Epplen | first4 = JT | title = Disgust in pre-clinical Huntington's disease: a longitudinal study | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 518–33 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16098998 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2005.07.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People with Huntington's disease are impaired at recognition of anger and fear, and experience a notably severe problem with disgust recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprengelmeyer | first1 = R. | last2 = Young | first2 = A.W. | last3 = Calder | first3 = A.J. | last4 = Karnat | first4 = A. | last5 = Lange | first5 = H. | last6 = Homberg | first6 = V. | year = 1996 | title = Loss of disgust: Perception of faces and emotions in Huntington's disease | url = | journal = Brain | volume = 119 | issue = | pages = 1647–1665 | display-authors = 6 | pmid = 8931587 | last7 = Perrett | first7 = DI | last8 = Rowland | first8 = D | doi=10.1093/brain/119.5.1647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major depressive disorder===
Patients suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|major depression]] have been found to display greater brain activation to facial expressions of disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.02.010 | title=Depression is associated with increased sensitivity to signals of disgust: a functional magnetic resonance imaging study | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022395610000518 | journal = J Psychiatr Res | volume = 44 | issue = 1 | pages =894–902 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20307892 |vauthors=Surguladze SA, El-Hage W, Dalgleish T, Radua J, Gohier B, Phillips ML | pmc=4282743 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Obsessive-compulsive disorder ===
The emotion of disgust may have an important role in understanding the neurobiology of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD), particularly in those with contamination preoccupations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stein | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Liu | first2 = Y. | last3 = Shapira | first3 = N.A. | last4 = Goodman | first4 = W.K. | year = 2001 | title = The psychobiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder: How important is disgust? | url = | journal = Current Psychiatry | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 281–287 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-001-0020-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study by Shapira &amp; colleagues (2003), eight OCD subjects with contamination preoccupations and eight healthy volunteers viewed pictures from the International Affective Picture System during f-MRI scans. OCD subjects showed significantly greater neural responses to disgust-invoking images, specifically in the right insula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shapira | year = 2003 | title = Brain activation by disgust-inducing pictures in obsessive-compulsive disorder | url = | journal = Biological Psychiatry | volume = 54 | issue = 7| pages = 751–756 | pmid = 14512216 | last2 = Liu | first2 = Y | last3 = He | first3 = A.

OCD subjects and healthy volunteers showed activation patterns in response to disgust pictures that differed significantly at the right insula. In contrast, the two groups were similar in their response to threat-inducing pictures, with no significant group differences at any site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sprengelmeyer | first1 = R. | last2 = Young | first2 = A.

== Animal research ==
With respect to studies using [[rat]]s, prior research of signs of a conditioned disgust response have been experimentally verified by Grill and Norgren (1978) who developed a systematic test to assess [[palatability]]. The Taste Reactivity (TR) test has thus become a standard tool in measuring disgust response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grill | first1 = H.C. | last2 = Norgren | first2 = R. | year = 1978a | title = The taste Reactivity Test.

"Gaping" in rats is the most dominant conditioned disgust reaction and the muscles used in this response mimic those used in species capable of vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Travers | first1 = J. B. | last2 = Norgren | first2 = R. | year = 1986 | title = Electromyographic analysis of the ingestion and rejection of sapid stimuli in the rat | url = | journal = Behavioral Neuroscience | volume = 100 | issue = 4| pages = 544–555 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7044.100.4.544 | pmid = 3741605 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that treatments that reduced [[serotonin]] availability or that activate the [[endocannabinoid system]] can interfere with the expression of a conditioned disgust reaction in rats. These researchers showed that as nausea produced conditioned disgust reactions, by administering the rats with an antinausea treatment they could prevent toxin-induced conditioned disgust reactions. Furthermore, in looking at the different disgust and vomiting reactions between rats and shrews the authors showed that these reactions (particularly vomiting) play a crucial role in the associative processes that govern food selection across species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = Linda A. | last2 = Limebeer | first2 = Cheryl L. | last3 = Rana | first3 = Shadna A. | year = 2008 | title = Conditioned nausea in rats: assessment by conditioned disgust reactions, rather than [[conditioned taste avoidance]] | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 198–209 | doi = 10.1037/a0012531 | pmid = 18778149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In discussing specific neural locations of disgust, research has shown that forebrain mechanisms are necessary for rats to acquire conditioned disgust for a specific emetic (vomit-inducing) substance (such as [[lithium chloride]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grill | first1 = H.C. | last2 = Norgren | first2 = R. | year = 1978b | title = Chronically decerebrate rats demonstrate satiation but not bait shyness | url = | journal = Science | volume = 201 | issue = 4352| pages = 267–269 | doi = 10.1126/science.663655 | pmid = 663655 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have shown that lesions to the area postrema&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eckel | first1 = L.

W 1991"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Flynn | first1 = F. W | last2 = Grill | first2 = H.

W 1991"/&gt; prevented conditioned disgust. Moreover, lesions of the [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] and [[Anatomical terms of location#Left and right (lateral), and medial|medial]] [[raphe nuclei]] (depleting forebrain [[serotonin]]) prevented the establishment of lithium chloride-induced conditioned disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Parker | first1 = Linda A. | last2 = Limebeer | first2 = Cheryl L. | last3 = Rana | first3 = Shadna A. | year = 2008 | title = Conditioned nausea in rats: assessment by conditioned disgust reactions, rather than conditioned taste avoidance | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 62 | issue = 3| pages = 198–209 | doi = 10.1037/a0012531 | pmid = 18778149 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morality==
Although disgust was first thought to be a motivation for humans to only physical contaminants, it has since been applied to moral and social moral contaminants as well. The similarities between these types of disgust can especially be seen in the way people react to the contaminants. For example, if someone stumbles upon a pool of vomit, he/she will do whatever possible to place as much distance between himself/herself and the vomit as possible, which can include pinching the nose, closing the eyes, or running away. Likewise, when a group experiences someone who cheats, rapes, or murders another member of the group, its reaction is to shun or expel that person from the group.&lt;ref name="DOIa"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0013435 | pmid =18837611 | title = Moral hypervigilance: The influence of disgust sensitivity in the moral domain | year = 2008 | last1 = Jones | first1 = Andrew | last2 = Fitness | first2 = Julie | journal = Emotion | volume = 8 | issue = 5 | pages = 613–27  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones &amp; Fitness (2008)&lt;ref name="DOIa" /&gt; coined the term "moral [[hypervigilance]]" to describe the phenomenon that individuals who are prone to physical disgust are also prone to moral disgust. The link between physical disgust and moral disgust can be seen in the United States where criminals are often referred to as "slime" or "scum" and criminal activity as "stinking" or being "fishy". Furthermore, people often try to block out the stimuli of morally repulsive images in much the same way that they would block out the stimuli of a physically repulsive image. When people see an image of abuse, rape, or murder, they often avert their gazes to inhibit the incoming visual stimuli from the photograph just like they would if they saw a decomposing body.

Moral judgments can be traditionally defined or thought of as directed by standards such as impartiality and respect towards others for their well-being. From more recent theoretical and empirical information, it can be suggested that [[morality]] may be guided by basic affective processes. [[Jonathan Haidt]] proposed that one’s instant judgments about morality are experienced as a "flash of intuition" and that these affective perceptions operate rapidly, associatively, and outside of [[consciousness]].&lt;ref name="David2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=David|first=B.|author2=Olatunji, B.O.|title=The effect of disgust conditioning and disgust sensitivity on appraisals of moral transgressions|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2011|volume=50|pages=1142–1146|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.02.004|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this, moral intuitions are believed to be stimulated prior to conscious moral cognitions which correlates with having a greater influence on moral judgments.&lt;ref name="David2011" /&gt;

Research suggests that the experience of disgust can alter moral judgments. Many studies have focused on the average change in behavior across participants, with some studies indicating disgust stimuli intensifies the severity of moral judgments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schnall|first1=Simone|title=Disgust as Embodied Moral Judgment|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date=July 1, 2008|volume=34|pages=1096–1109|doi=10.1177/0146167208317771}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, additional studies have found the reverse effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cummins|first1=DD|title=Emotion and deliberative reasoning in moral judgment|journal=Front Psychol|date=2012|volume=3|issue=328|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00328}}&lt;/ref&gt; and recent studies have suggested that the average effect of disgust on moral judgments is small or absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = May | first1 = J. | year = 2014 | title = Does Disgust Influence Moral Judgment? | journal = Australasian Journal of Philosophy | volume = 92 | issue = 1 | pages = 125–141 | doi = 10.1080/00048402.2013.797476 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landy |first1=J |title=Does incidental disgust amplify moral judgment? A meta-analytic review of experimental evidence. |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |date= |url=http://justinflandy.com/Meta-Analysis%20FINAL%20ACCEPTED.pdf |doi=10.1177/1745691615583128 |volume=10 |pages=518–536 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319220946/http://justinflandy.com/Meta-Analysis%20FINAL%20ACCEPTED.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Potentially reconciling these effects, a study recently indicated that the direction and size of the effect of disgust stimuli on moral judgment depends upon an individual's sensitivity to disgust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ong|first1=HH|title=Moral judgment modulation by disgust is bi-directionally moderated by individual sensitivity|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|date=2014|volume=5|pmc=3944793|pmid=24639665|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00194|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect also seems to be limited to a certain aspect of morality. Horberg et al. found that disgust plays a role in the development and intensification of moral judgments of purity in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horberg|first=E. J.|author2=Oveis, C. |author3=Keltner, D. |author4=Cohen, A. B. |title=Disgust and the moralization of purity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=97|issue=6|pages=963–976|doi=10.1037/a0017423|pmid=19968413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other words, the feeling of disgust is often associated with a feeling that some image of what is pure has been violated. For example, a vegetarian might feel disgust after seeing another person eating meat because he/she has a view of vegetarianism as the pure state-of-being. When this state-of-being is violated, the vegetarian feels disgust. Furthermore, disgust appears to be uniquely associated with purity judgments, not with what is just/unjust or what is harmful/caregiving, while other emotions such as fear, anger, and sadness are "unrelated to moral judgments of purity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Horberg|first=E. J.|author2=Oveis, C. |author3=Keltner, D. |author4=Cohen, A. B. |title=Disgust and the moralization of purity|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=97|issue=6|pages=972–973|doi=10.1037/a0017423|pmid=19968413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other research suggests that an individual’s level of disgust sensitivity is due to their particular experience of disgust.&lt;ref name="David2011" /&gt; One’s disgust sensitivity can be either high or low. The higher one’s disgust sensitivity is, the greater the tendency to make stricter moral judgments.&lt;ref name="David2011" /&gt; Disgust sensitivity can also relate to various aspects of moral values, which can have a negative or positive impact. For example, Disgust sensitivity is associated with moral hypervigilance, which means people who have higher disgust sensitivity are more likely to think that other people who are suspects of a crime are more guilty. They also associate them as being morally evil and criminal, thus endorsing them to harsher punishment in the setting of a court.

Disgust is also theorized as an evaluative [[emotion]] that can control moral [[behavior]].&lt;ref name="David2011" /&gt; When one experiences disgust, this emotion might signal that certain behaviors, objects, or people are to be avoided in order to preserve their [[wikt:pure|purity]]. Research has established that when the idea or concept of cleanliness is made salient then people make less severe moral judgments of others.&lt;ref name="David2011" /&gt; From this particular finding, it can be suggested that this reduces the experience of disgust and the ensuing threat of psychological impurity diminishes the apparent severity of moral transgressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=David|first=B.|author2=Olatunji, B.O.|title=The effect of disgust conditioning and disgust sensitivity on appraisals of moral [[transgression (disambiguation)|transgressions]]|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2011|volume=50|pages=1142–1146|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2011.02.004|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political orientation===
In one study, people of differing political persuasions were shown disgusting images in a [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|brain scanner]]. In [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]], the basal ganglia and amygdala and several other regions showed increased activity, while in [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] other regions of the brain increased in activity. Both groups reported similar conscious reactions to the images. The difference in activity patterns was large: the reaction to a single image could predict a person's political leanings with 95% accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Left or right-wing?

===Self-disgust===
Although limited research has been done on self-disgust, one study found that self-disgust and severity of moral judgments were negatively correlated.&lt;ref name="DOIa_a"&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1037/a0024074 | pmid =21707158 | title = Who am I to judge? Self-disgust predicts less punishment of severe transgressions | year = 2012 | last1 = Olatunji | first1 = Bunmi O. | last2 = David | first2 = Bieke | last3 = Ciesielski | first3 = Bethany G. | journal = Emotion | volume = 12 | pages = 169–73 | issue = 1  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to findings related to disgust, which typically results in harsher judgments of transgressions. This implies that disgust directed towards the self functions very differently from disgust directed towards other people or objects.&lt;ref name="DOIa_a" /&gt; Self-disgust "may reflect a pervasive condition of self-loathing that makes it difficult to assign deserving punishment to others".&lt;ref name="DOIa_a" /&gt; In other words, those who feel self-disgust cannot easily condemn others to punishment because they feel that they may also be deserving of punishment.

The emotion of disgust can be described to serve as an affective mechanism following occurrences of negative social value, provoking repulsion, and desire for social distance.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherman|first=Gary D.|author2=Johnathon Haidt|title=Cuteness and Disgust: The Humanizing and Dehumanizing Effects of Emotion|journal=Emotion Review|year=2011|volume=3|issue=3|pages=245–251|doi=10.1177/1754073911402396}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of disgust can be defined by motivating the avoidance of offensive things, and in the context of a [[social environment]], it can become an instrument of social avoidance.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; An example of disgust in action can be found from the [[Bible]] in the book of Leviticus. Leviticus includes direct commandments from [[God]] to avoid disgust causing individuals, which included people who were sexually immoral and those who had [[leprosy]].&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; Disgust is also known to have originally evolved as a response to unpleasant food that may have been carriers of [[disease]].&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt;

As an effective instrument for reducing motivations for [[social interaction]], disgust can be anticipated to interfere with [[dehumanization]] or the maltreatment of persons as less than human.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; Research was performed which conducted several functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) in which participants viewed images of individuals from stigmatized groups that were associated with disgust, which were drug addicts and homeless people.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; What the study found was that people were not inclined in making inferences about the mental conditions of these particular disgust inducing groups.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; Therefore, examining images of homeless people and drug addicts caused disgust in the response of the people who participated with this study.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; This study coincides with disgust following the [[law of contagion]], which explains that contact with disgusting material renders one disgusting.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; Disgust can be applied towards people and can function as maltreatment towards another human being. Disgust can exclude people from being a part of a [[clique]] by leading to the view that they are merely less than human. An example of this is if groups were to avoid people from outside of their own particular group. Some researchers have distinguished between two different forms of dehumanization. The first form is the denial of uniquely human traits, examples include: products of culture and modification.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; The second form is the denial of [[human nature]], examples include: [[emotionality]] and [[personality]].&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt;

Failure to attribute distinctively human traits to a group leads to [[animalistic dehumanization]], which defines the object group or individual as savage, [[:wikt:crude|crude]], and similar to [[animals]].&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; These forms of dehumanization have clear connections to disgust.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; Researchers have proposed that many disgust elicitors are disgusting because they are reminders that humans are not diverse from other creatures.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; With the aid of disgust, animalistic dehumanization directly reduces one’s moral concerns towards excluding members from the outer group.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; Disgust can be a cause and consequence of dehumanization.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; Animalistic dehumanization may generate feelings of disgust and revulsion.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; Feelings of disgust, through rousing [[social distance]], may lead to dehumanization. Therefore, a person or group that is generally connected with disgusting effects and seen as physically unclean may induce moral avoidance.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt; Being deemed disgusting produces a variety of cognitive effects that result in [[:wikt:exclusion|exclusion]] from the perceived inner group.&lt;ref name="Sherman2011" /&gt;

==Political and legal aspects of disgust==
The emotion disgust has been noted to feature strongly in the public sphere in relation to issues and debates, among other things, regarding [[anatomy]], [[sex]] and [[bioethics]]. There is a range of views by different commentators on the role, purpose and effects of disgust on public discourse.

[[Leon Kass]], a [[bioethicist]], has advocated that "in crucial cases...repugnance is the emotional expression of deep wisdom, beyond reason's power fully to articulate it." in relation to bio-ethical issues (See: [[Wisdom of repugnance]]).

[[Martha Nussbaum]], a [[jurist]] and [[ethicist]], explicitly rejects disgust as an appropriate guide for legislating, arguing the "politics of disgust" is an unreliable emotional reaction with no inherent wisdom. Furthermore, she argues this "politics of disgust" has in the past and present had the effects of supporting bigotry in the forms of sexism, racism and antisemitism and links the emotion of disgust to support for laws against [[Miscegenation]] and the oppressive caste system in India.  In place of this "politics of disgust", Nussbaum argues for the [[Harm principle]] from [[John Stuart Mill]] as the proper basis for legislating. Nussbaum argues the harm principle supports the legal ideas of [[consent]], the [[Age of majority]] and [[privacy]] and protects citizens. She contrasts this with the "politics of disgust" which she argues denies citizens humanity and equality before the law on no rational grounds and cause palpable social harm. (See Martha Nussbaum, ''From Disgust to Humanity: Sexual Orientation and Constitutional Law''). Nussbaum published ''Hiding From Humanity: Disgust, Shame, and the Law'' in 2004; the book examines the relationship of disgust and [[shame]] to a society's laws.  Nussbaum identifies disgust as a marker that bigoted, and often merely majoritarian, discourse employs to "place", by diminishment and denigration, a despised minority.  Removing "disgust" from public discourse constitutes an important step in achieving humane and tolerant democracies.

[[Leigh Turner]] (2004) has argued that "reactions of disgust are often built upon prejudices that should be challenged and rebutted."  On the other hand, writers, such as Kass, find wisdom in adhering to one's initial feelings of disgust.  A number of writers on the theory of disgust find it to be the proto-legal foundation of human law.

Disgust has also figured prominently in the work of several other philosophers.  [[Nietzsche]] became disgusted with the music and orientation of [[Richard Wagner]], as well as other aspects of 19th century culture and morality. [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] wrote widely about experiences involving various negative emotions related to disgust.&lt;ref&gt;Sartre, Jean Paul. (1943) "Being and Nothingness''. Trans. Hazel Barnes. P. 604-607.&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''The Hydra's Tale: Imagining Disgust'' ==
According to the book ''The Hydra's Tale: Imagining Disgust'' by [[Robert Rawdon Wilson]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wilson RR |volume=34 |number=2 |year=2007 |title=Wilson On Disgust: A Menippean Interview. Interview with Robert Wilson |url=https://ejournals.library.ualberta.ca/index.php/crcl/article/view/10712}}&lt;/ref&gt; disgust may be further subdivided into physical disgust, associated with physical or metaphorical uncleanliness, and moral disgust, a similar feeling related to courses of action. For example; "I am disgusted by the hurtful things that you are saying."  Moral disgust should be understood as [[culturally determined]]; physical disgust as more universally grounded. The book also discusses moral disgust as an aspect of the representation of disgust.  Wilson does this in two ways. First, he discusses representations of disgust in literature, film and fine art.  Since there are characteristic facial expressions (the clenched nostrils, the pursed lips)—as [[Charles Darwin]], [[Paul Ekman]], and others have shown—they may be represented with more or less skill in any set of circumstances imaginable. There may even be "disgust worlds" in which disgust motifs so dominate that it may seem that entire represented world is, in itself, disgusting. Second, since people know what disgust is as a primary, or visceral, emotion (with characteristic gestures and expressions), they may imitate it. Thus, Wilson argues that, for example, contempt is acted out on the basis of the visceral emotion, disgust, but is not identical with disgust. It is a "compound affect" that entails intellectual preparation, or formatting, and theatrical techniques. Wilson argues that there are many such "intellectual" compound affects—such as nostalgia and outrage—but that disgust is a fundamental and unmistakable example. Moral disgust, then, is different from visceral disgust; it is more conscious and more layered in performance.

Wilson links [[shame]] and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] to disgust (now transformed, wholly or partially, into self-disgust) primarily as a consequence rooted in [[self-consciousness]]. Referring to a passage in [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''The Golden Notebook'', Wilson writes that "the dance between disgust and shame takes place. A slow choreography unfolds before the mind's-eye."&lt;ref name="wilson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Wilson, Robert Rawdon |year=2002 |title=The Hydra’s Tale: Imagining Disgust |publisher=U Alberta Press |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson examines the claims of several jurists and legal scholars—such as William Ian Miller—that disgust must underlie positive law. "In the absence of disgust", he observes, stating their claim, ". . . there would be either total barbarism or a society ruled solely by force, violence and terror." The moral-legal argument, he remarks, "leaves much out of account."&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt; His own argument turns largely upon the human capacity to learn how to control, even to suppress, strong and problematic affects and, over time, for entire populations to abandon specific disgust responses.

'''Emaux de Briare'''  is a French company specializing today in mosaics. Whilst the manufactory in [[Briare]] originally started with earthenware pottery, the factory founded in Paris by Jean-Félix Bapterosses (1813–1885) initially began manufacturing porcelain buttons in 1845. They merged in 1851, at which date its international development started:  1851 in [[The Great Exhibition]], UK and as early as  1853 in the United States. It's current American subsidiary is located in [[Copiague]] NY.

[[File:M. Bapterosse.JPG|thumb|the founder, Jean-Félix Bapterosses]]

==History==

===Early years===

The company began as  '''Bapterosses &amp; Cie''' of [[Paris, France]], which was established to manufacture and sell porcelain buttons made according to a method quite similar to the one patented by Richard Prosser in 1840, but following the invention of a device that could mold 500 buttons at a time vs. only one at the competing English factory,&lt;ref&gt;Ornament 1995 p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mintons]] (which had acquired the rights to the original patent) thanks to a new formulation of the paste in which milk was added to the slip to improve plasticity.&lt;ref&gt;Nourisson p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;
Jean-Félix Bapterosses was hence named Officer of the French [[Legion of Honor]] in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;Nourisson p.33&lt;/ref&gt; His bust, sculpted by [[Henri Chapu]] and founded by [[Ferdinand Barbedienne]] is now exhibited in the ''museum of enamel &amp; mosaics'' in Briare.

===Today===
[[File:Cruz-Diez Marlin Ballpark Miami.jpg|thumb|226x226px|left | ''Chromatic Induction in a Double Frequency''  Marlins Ballpark,  Miami, with Briare mosaics.]]
Today émaux de Briare sells its mosaics across the world for small and large projects alike, one of the latest ones being the walkways for the new [[Miami Marlins]] stadium, designed by Venezuelan artist [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]]. It currently operates from its US headquarters in [[Bay Shore, New York|Bayshore]] NY for the North American market.

==Products==

===Buttons===

Bapterosses &amp; Cie was bent on efficiency and multiplied inventions to boost productivity.&lt;ref&gt;China buttons p.9-14&lt;/ref&gt; For instance in 1858 (US letters of patent N°19,120), they invented buttons with shanks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buttoncountry.com/%60PatentsbyPage/Patent%20Pages/1858_Enamel%20and%20Porcelain.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American, 30th January 1858&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Bapterosses was also a precocious marketing man in the sense that he immediately advertised his products under the ''FB'' brand &lt;ref&gt;Buttons p.74-76&lt;/ref&gt; and associated it with the numerous medals &amp; awards he had received the world over.

===Beads===

With the growing colonial thrust a new market appeared notably in Africa for fancy beads.&lt;ref&gt;Nourisson&lt;/ref&gt; The models made included faceted beads, mother-of-pearl beads and [[chevron bead]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Chevron beads p.11&lt;/ref&gt; They were also used for trading with Native Americans in the second half of the 19th century, as well as for the fashion conscious ladies of the time.

[[File:Perles vrac anciennes.jpg|thumb|"mother of pearl" type beads in Émaux de Briare]]

===Mosaics===

With the [[Art nouveau]] movement, there was a revival of interest in mosaics. Émaux de Briare introduced a new concept of pre-cut mosaics &lt;ref&gt;Nourisson p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; that would make it much cheaper to adorn buildings, than with the traditional method. When the [[Art deco]] movement came, Emaux de Briare adapted and worked with then trendy architects such as [[Robert Mallet-Stevens]], (bathroom in [[Villa Cavrois]] for instance. Later emaux de Briare mosaics were also much used in the [[Op art]] movement, notably by [[Victor Vasarely]] or [[Yaacov Agam]]. Today, Briare mosaics are used by street artists, such as the French [[Invader (artist)|Invader]].

==Markets==

===The American market===

In 1853, the buttons were exhibited in the [[Exhibition of the Industry of All Nations]] in [[New York City]]. In 1876, beads appeared in the [[Centennial Exposition]] in [[Philadelphia]] at which time the company was awarded a prize medal. Then in Chicago, in 1893, the mosaics appeared in the [[World's Columbian Exposition]].

The main customers in the latter part of the 19th century were:
* Howard, Sanger Co's dry goods store at 105-107 Chambers Street, New York.
* Louis B. Binsse &amp; Co's fancy goods store at 83 William Street in New York.
* Dieckerhoff, Raffloer at 560 Broadway, New York.
* Ostheimer Bros. in Philadelphia, PA.&lt;ref&gt;Nourisson p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Certificat Philadelphie 1876.jpg|thumb|Award, Philadelphia, PA - 1876 for Bapterosses &amp; Cie]]

===Other markets===

Emaux de Briare exhibited in numerous world exhibitions:
Paris in 1855, honor medal ; London in 1862 « prize medal »  ; [[Porto]] in 1865,  "gloria victoribus" medal ; Paris in 1867, gold medal and in 1878 Grand Prize ; [[Vienna]] in 1873, medal; [[Sydney]] in 1879 ; [[Melbourne]] in 1880; [[Amsterdam]] in 1883, medal; [[Antwerp]] in 1885, gold medal ;  Paris in 1889 « Grand Prize ».

Emaux de Briare beads were especially successful in Africa in the latter part of the 19th century, because of their regular appearance imitating ancient beads.&lt;ref&gt;''a handbook on beads'' p.87&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1886 Sigfus founded Eymundsson [[publishing]] and in coming years he would publish many of Iceland's poets, including [[Hannes Hafstein]] and [[Bólu-Hjálmar]]. Sigfus was the first to import [[typewriter]]s and [[Safe|money safes]]. He was also the first Icelander to publish and sell [[postcard]]s, using his own photos as material.

In 1920 Eymundsson bought the house on Austurstræti 18.

'''Folkestone &amp; Hythe Operatic &amp; Dramatic Society''', '''FHODS''', is a [[charitable organization]] that holds performances and events at its theatre in [[Shorncliffe, Kent|Shorncliffe]], [[The Tower Theatre (Folkestone, Kent)|the Tower Theatre]]. A theatre which has been developed by '''FHODS''' from what used to be a church, for all types of performances.
The society includes a very active Youth Section who perform three shows a year and meet  at [[The Tower Theatre (Folkestone, Kent)|the Tower Theatre]].

==History==
The Folkestone Dramatic &amp; Music Club was formed in 1902, performing at the Woodward Institute. This was later changed to the Folkestone Operatic Society in 1913 performing at the Pleasure Gardens Theatre.

The society closed for the duration of [[World War I]] (1914–1918), then continued to present plays up until [[World War II]] (1939–1945) when it closed once more. In 1947 [[Hythe, Kent|Hythe]] was added to the name and the society held productions at the Leas Pavilion Theatre, [[Folkestone]] Town Hall, and Chichester Hall in [[Sandgate, Kent|Sandgate]].

==Youth Section==
FHODS Youth Section caters for young people aged between 12 and 21 who are interested any aspects of theatre. They meet every Sunday at the Tower Theatre. They put on 3 shows a year:
*The Brigadier Thomas Competition - held in spring, "the Brig" consists of a collection of one act plays (usually four) written, directed and performed by Youth Section members based around a common theme. On the second and final night they are judged by three adult section adjudicators for prizes for "Best Play", "Best Stagecraft", "Best Actor", "Best Actress", "Most Promising Newcomer Actor" and "Most Promising Newcomer Actress".
*The Summer Show - held in late summer or early autumn, the Summer Show is the principle Youth Section production where they put on a full-length play acted and directed by Youth Section members. Past titles include "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory", "The Insect Play", "Carpe Jugulum", "Little Women" and "James and the Giant Peach".
*The Christmas Revue - a relaxed format including songs, sketches and monologues. The emphasis is on showcasting the talent of the Youth Section.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14181">The '''Forbidden City''' was a Chinese nightclub and cabaret in business from the late 1930s to the late 1950s, on the second floor of 363 Sutter  Street (the former space is now renumbered 369 Sutter Street and is now a franchise of Barbizon Modeling and Acting) in San Francisco between [[Chinatown, San Francisco, California|Chinatown]] and [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]].&lt;ref name="museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist10/forbidcity.html|accessdate=2007-10-12|publisher=the virtual museum of the City of San Francisco|title=Ronald Reagan at Charlie Low's Forbidden City}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forbidden City featured Asian American singers, dancers, chorus lines, magicians, strippers, and musicians.&lt;ref name="theatre"/&gt;  It was popular with military personnel who were transiting through San Francisco during World War II. The novel, and in turn the [[Flower Drum Song|musical]] and [[Flower Drum Song (film)|film]] ''Flower Drum Song'' were inspired by the Forbidden City, as was the 1989 [[documentary film|documentary]], ''Forbidden City U.S.A''.

==History==
[[File:Forbid.jpg|thumb|Promotional playbill from the Forbidden City nightclub]]
Charlie Low, the son of small store owners from Nevada,&lt;ref name="usher"&gt;{{cite news|work=San Francisco Chronicle|title=Forbidden City ushered in golden age of Chinatown nightclubs|author=Gary Kamiya|date=January 9, 2015|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Forbidden-City-ushered-in-golden-age-of-Chinatown-6005033.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened the Forbidden City in 1938, after the success of Chinese Village, which he opened two years earlier.&lt;ref name="usher"/&gt; Named after the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], the new club became the most famous among approximately 12 Chinese-themed cabaret clubs in Chinatown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfpalm.org/chinesetheater/15_overview.html|accessdate=2007-10-12|publisher=San Francisco Performing Arts Library|title=The Jazz Age in Chinatown|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623073933/http://www.sfpalm.org/chinesetheater/15_overview.html|archivedate=2007-06-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was located on the outskirts of San Francisco's Chinatown, and intended to cater to the curiosity of a largely white audience.&lt;ref name="usher"/&gt; Initially, Low found it difficult to recruit performers from the local Chinese community, which looked down on entertainers, particularly women in sexually provocative performances. Business was slow until Low hired Noel Toy, a nude model who had been performing at the [[Golden Gate International Exposition]].&lt;ref name="usher"/&gt; [[Life Magazine]] published a 3-page profile of the club, praising the dancing abilities of Chinese women as a "fragile charm distinctive to their race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QUoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA124#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Life goes to the 'Forbidden City' |author= |date=9 December 1940 |volume=9 |number=24 |publisher=Time, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois |magazine=Life |pages=124–127 |accessdate=8 December 2017}} Photographs credited to Horace Bristol.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club thrived during World War II, and throughout the 1940s and 1950s. In 1957 author [[C. Y. Lee (author)|C. Y. Yee]] wrote a best-selling novel, ''Flower Drum Song'', set at the Forbidden City.  [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] created a popular musical from the book in 1958, which has had several revivals, the most recent by [[David Henry Hwang]] in 2001-2002.  In 1961 a Hollywood film was made from the musical.  These portrayals did little to help the club, however.  By the late 1950s it was facing increasing competition from more explicit shows, such as the [[Condor Club]] in [[North Beach, San Francisco, California|North Beach]].  Owner Charlie Low retired in 1962 selling the club to exotic dancer Cobi Yee. Yee managed the club until it closed in 1970. The space was destroyed by a fire in the 1980s, but the building survived and was used as a computer instruction center as of 2000.&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

An hour-long documentary, ''Forbidden City, U.S.A'', was filmed in the mid-1980s and released in 1989, featuring most of the original cast.  The documentary led indirectly to a second singing career for [[Larry Ching]], the club's "Chinese Frank Sinatra."

==Description==
The Forbidden City has been compared to an Asian-American version of the [[Cotton Club]], in that it featured an all-ethnic cast of performers for a mostly white audience, performing to the popular tastes of the time rather than in stereotyped or authentic ethnic roles.&lt;ref name="theatre"&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Asian American Theatre|author=Esther Kim Lee|accessdate=2007-10-12|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rj2W7MrqgRUC | isbn=978-0-521-85051-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some acts played up the supposed [[exoticism]] of ethnic Chinese, as well as sensuality of Chinese women.&lt;ref name="theatre"/&gt;  The owner, Charlie Low, generated publicity by nicknaming the performers after famous mainstream celebrities (the "Chinese Frank Sinatra", the "Chinese Fred Astaire", and so on).  Part of the club's appeal to both audiences and performers was the "racial cross-dressing" of placing Asian Americans into traditionally white entertainer roles, and the racial dialog that came out of the varying level of success of the various performers had in fitting into these roles.&lt;ref name="chinatown"/&gt;

For many visitors from middle-America, Forbidden City was their first encounter with people of Asian ethnicity.&lt;ref name="theatre"/&gt;  San Francisco's Asian population was approximately 4.2% of the population in 1940, versus 0.2% for all of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Census Statistics on Population Data by Race|author=Campbell Gibson and Kay Jung|publisher=US Census Bureau|year=2005|accessdate=2007-10-12|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0081/twps0081.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the cast included Filipino Americans, Japanese Americans (except during World War II, when the club's Japanese American performers were removed as part of the [[Japanese American internment]]), Korean Americans and other Asian Americans, they were presented to audiences as Chinese.

The club itself seated 300, and also contained elaborate stage area and dressing rooms (accessed through the kitchen!&lt;ref name="KUCI: filmschool"&gt;[http://www.kuci.org/podcastfiles/683/long.mp3 Long Story Short / Jodi Long Interview] [http://www.kuci.org/filmschool/spring2008.html KUCI: filmschool]&lt;/ref&gt;).  Typical of the clubs of the time, in front, it displayed pictures of famous guests (greeted by Low).&lt;ref name="chinatown"/&gt;

An evening's entertainment at Forbidden City included a full Chinese or American dinner followed by dancing, then a floor show.&lt;ref name="chinatown"/&gt;  Acts were a combination of [[vaudeville]] and [[burlesque]]-style performances, including singing, tap dancing, ballroom dancing, skits, slapstick, tumbling, and parodies of American [[cowboy]] scenes.&lt;ref name="theatre"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chinatown"&gt;{{cite book|title=Picturing Chinatown: Art and Orientalism in San Francisco|author=Anthony W. Lee|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xkVA7JgdhPcC|publisher=University of California Press|year=2001 | isbn=978-0-520-22592-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Charlie Low photo holder (From August of 1947).jpg|thumb|Image of the front and inside of a photo folder. Guests could get a 5x7 image of their evening at the Forbidden City signed by their host Charlie Low.]]

The club also formed a touring company that played across the United States and Canada, as well as [[USO]] shows worldwide.&lt;ref name="chinatown"/&gt;

==Notable performers==
A number of Asian American musicians, actors, and other celebrities either started their professions at the Forbidden City, or are famous for performing there.  During the early years of the club the performers' salaries, modest as they were, provided rare employment opportunities for Asian-Americans suffering under the discriminatory laws of the time.&lt;ref name="chinatown"/&gt;

* [[Jack Soo]] got his break in ''[[Flower Drum Song]]'' when he was discovered working there as MC, and was eventually cast as the MC and night club owner in the Broadway musical and film, and later became one of the most prominent Asian American actors.

* [[Noel Toy]], the "Chinese [[Sally Rand]]", performed a burlesque [[fan dance]] and [[bubble dance]] (Rand had also been a nude performer at the Treasure Island exhibition).
* [[Katy de la Cruz]], the "Queen of Filipino Jazz", was a top-billed performer during the late 1940s to early 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ricky Lo |url=http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/sb/sb003517.htm |title=Katy de la Cruz: Remembering Mommy Kate |publisher=Philippine Star/Philippine Headline News Online |date=2004-12-20 |accessdate=2008-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816123249/http://www.newsflash.org/2004/02/sb/sb003517.htm |archivedate=2007-08-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Jackie Mei Ling, a very famous and successful dancer and female impersonator, publicly identified himself as a gay man. He is famous for his innovative Oriental dance in various performances.

Both Jimmy and Larry are Hawaiian-born artists. Jimmy's ancestry was Portuguese, Hawaiian and Chinese.  Jimmy's style of singing was jazzy, sounding like a cross between Mel Tormé and Frank Sinatra but uniquely his own. Jimmy continues to perform in symphony POPS concerts around the world (Florida, New Zealand, Honolulu, San Diego, etc.) to this day.

'''Graphical projection''' is a protocol, used in [[technical drawing]], by which an image of a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] object is projected onto a planar surface without the aid of numerical calculation.

==Overview==
[[File:Graphical projection comparison.png|thumb|right|Several types of graphical projection compared]]
[[File:Various projections of cube above plane.svg|thumb|Various projections and how they are produced]]
The projection is achieved by the use of imaginary "projectors". The projected, mental image becomes the technician’s vision of the desired, finished picture. By following the protocol the technician may produce the envisioned picture on a planar surface such as drawing paper. The protocols provide a uniform imaging procedure among people trained in technical graphics (mechanical drawing, computer aided design, etc.).&lt;!--This is poorly written--&gt;

There are two graphical projection categories each with its own protocol:
*[[parallel projection]]
*[[perspective (graphical)|perspective projection]]

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Parallel projection==
{{Main|Parallel projection}}
[[File:Camera focal length distance house animation.gif|thumb|Parallel projection corresponds to a perspective projection with a hypothetical viewpoint; i.e. one where the camera lies an infinite distance away from the object and has an infinite focal length, or "zoom".]]
In parallel projection, the lines of sight from the object to the [[projection plane]] are parallel to each other. Thus, lines that are parallel in three-dimensional space remain parallel in the two-dimensional projected image. Parallel projection also corresponds to a [[perspective projection]] with an infinite [[focal length]] (the distance from a camera's [[camera lens|lens]] and [[focus (optics)|focal point]]), or "[[zoom lens|zoom]]".

Images drawn in parallel projection rely upon the technique of [[axonometry]] ("to measure along axes"), as described in [[Pohlke's theorem]]. In general, the resulting image is ''oblique'' (the rays are not perpendicular to the image plane); but in special cases the result is ''orthographic'' (the rays are perpendicular to the image plane). ''Axonometry'' should not be confused with ''axonometric projection'', as in English literature the latter usually refers only to a specific class of pictorials (see below).

===Orthographic projection===
{{Main|Orthographic projection}}
The orthographic projection is derived from the principles of [[descriptive geometry]] and is a two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional object. It is a parallel projection (the lines of projection are parallel both in reality and in the projection plane). It is the projection type of choice for [[plans (drawings)|working drawings]].

====Multiview projection====
{{Main|Multiview projection}}
[[File:Convention placement vues dessin technique.svg|thumb|right|Symbols used to define whether a multiview projection is either Third Angle (right) or First Angle (left).]]
With ''multiview projections'', up to six pictures (called ''primary views'') of an object are produced, with each projection plane parallel to one of the coordinate axes of the object. The views are positioned relative to each other according to either of two schemes: ''first-angle'' or ''third-angle'' projection. In each, the appearances of views may be thought of as being ''projected'' onto planes that form a 6-sided box around the object. Although six different sides can be drawn, ''usually'' three views of a drawing give enough information to make a 3D object. These views are known as ''front view'', ''top view'' and ''end view''. The terms ''elevation'', ''plan'' and ''section'' are also used.

====Axonometric projection====
{{Main|Axonometric projection}}
[[File:Axonometric projections.png|thumb|The three [[axonometric projection|axonometric views]]]]
Within orthographic projection there is an ancillary category known as ''orthographic pictorial'' or ''axonometric projection''. Axonometric projections show an image of an object as viewed from a skew direction in order to reveal all three directions (axes) of space in one picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mitchell |first= William |author2=Malcolm McCullough |title= Digital design media |publisher= John Wiley and Sons |date= 1994 |pages= 169 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JrZoGgQEhKkC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false |isbn= 0-471-28666-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axonometric instrument drawings are often used to approximate graphical perspective projections, but there is attendant distortion in the approximation. Because pictorial projections innately contain this distortion, in instrument drawings of pictorials great liberties may then be taken for economy of effort and best effect.{{clarify|date=May 2017}}

''Axonometric projection'' is further subdivided into three categories: ''isometric projection'', ''dimetric projection'' and ''trimetric projection'', depending on the exact angle at which the view deviates from the orthogonal.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Y_YqOlXoxMC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wqg9m-MaKI&amp;sig=xZ9MEJ8JjFcg28YefGxBW4zcZ2Y&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Tjj2SvO_CM-n8AaI8bTzCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CBoQ6AEwBQ#v=twopage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Drawing distinctions: the varieties of graphic expression|last=Maynard|first=Patric|last2=|first2=|date=2005|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=|isbn=0-8014-7280-6|location=|pages=22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mcreynolds"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H4eYq7-2YhYC&amp;pg=PA502&amp;dq=axonometric+orthographic#v=onepage&amp;q=axonometric%20orthographic&amp;f=false|title=Advanced graphics programming using openGL|last=McReynolds|first=Tom|date=2005|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=1-55860-659-9|pages=502|author2=David Blythe}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical characteristic of orthographic pictorials is that one axis of space is usually displayed as vertical.

''Axonometric projections'' are also sometimes known as ''auxiliary views'', as opposed to the ''primary views'' of ''multiview projections''.

=====Isometric projection=====
In '''isometric pictorials''' (for protocols see [[isometric projection]]), the direction of viewing is such that the three axes of space appear equally foreshortened, and there is a common angle of 120° between them. As the distortion caused by [[foreshortening]] is uniform the proportionality of all sides and lengths are preserved, and the axes share a common scale. This enables measurements to be read or taken directly from the drawing.

=====Dimetric projection=====
In '''dimetric pictorials''' (for protocols see [[dimetric projection]]), the direction of viewing is such that two of the three axes of space appear equally foreshortened, of which the attendant scale and angles of presentation are determined according to the angle of viewing; the scale of the third direction (vertical) is determined separately. Approximations are common in dimetric drawings.

=====Trimetric projection=====
In '''trimetric pictorials''' (for protocols see [[trimetric projection]]), the direction of viewing is such that all of the three axes of space appear unequally foreshortened. The scale along each of the three axes and the angles among them are determined separately as dictated by the angle of viewing. Approximations in Trimetric drawings are common.

===Oblique projection===
{{Main|Oblique projection}}
{{multiple image

}}
In ''oblique projections'' the parallel projection rays are not perpendicular to the viewing plane as with orthographic projection, but strike the projection plane at an angle other than ninety degrees. In both orthographic and oblique projection, parallel lines in space appear parallel on the projected image. Because of its simplicity, '''oblique projection''' is used exclusively for pictorial purposes rather than for formal, working drawings. In an oblique pictorial ''drawing'', the displayed angles among the axes as well as the foreshortening factors (scale) are arbitrary. The distortion created thereby is usually attenuated by aligning one plane of the imaged object to be parallel with the plane of projection thereby creating a true shape, full-size image of the chosen plane. Special types of oblique projections are:

====Cavalier projection====
In '''cavalier projection''' (sometimes '''cavalier perspective''' or '''high view point''') a point of the object is represented by three coordinates, ''x'', ''y'' and ''z''. On the drawing, it is represented by only two coordinates, ''x″'' and ''y″''. On the flat drawing, two axes, ''x'' and ''z'' on the figure, are [[perpendicular]] and the length on these axes are drawn with a 1:1 scale; it is thus similar to the [[dimetric projection]]s, although it is not an [[axonometric projection]], as the third axis, here ''y'', is drawn in diagonal, making an arbitrary angle with the ''x″'' axis, usually 30 or 45°. The length of the third axis is not scaled.

====Cabinet projection====
The term '''cabinet projection''' (sometimes '''cabinet perspective''') stems from its use in illustrations by the furniture industry.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} Like cavalier perspective, one face of the projected object is parallel to the viewing plane, and the third axis is projected as going off in an angle (typically 30° or 45° or arctan(2)= 63.4°). Unlike cavalier projection, where the third axis keeps its length, with cabinet projection the length of the receding lines is cut in half.

====Military projection====
A variant of [[oblique projection]] is called ''military projection''. In this case the horizontal sections are isometrically drawn so that the floor plans are not distorted and the verticals are drawn at an angle. The military projection is given by rotation in the ''xy''-plane and a vertical translation an amount ''z''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Perspect/Perspect.htm |title=Axonometric projections - a technical overview| accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations of parallel projection===
{{See also|Impossible object}}
{{Multiple image

}}

Objects drawn with parallel projection do not appear larger or smaller as they extend closer to or away from the viewer. While advantageous for [[architectural drawing]]s, where measurements must be taken directly from the image, the result is a perceived distortion, since unlike [[perspective projection]], this is not how our eyes or photography normally work. It also can easily result in situations where depth and altitude are difficult to gauge, as is shown in the illustration to the right.

In this isometric drawing, the blue sphere is two units higher than the red one. However, this difference in elevation is not apparent if one covers the right half of the picture, as the boxes (which serve as clues suggesting height) are then obscured.

This visual ambiguity has been exploited in [[op art]], As well as "impossible object" drawings. [[M. C. Escher]]'s ''[[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]]'' (1961), while not strictly using parallel projection, is a well-known example, in which a channel of water seems to travel unaided along a downward path, only to then paradoxically fall once again as it returns to its source. The water thus appears to disobey the [[conservation of energy|law of conservation of energy]]. An extreme example is depicted in the film ''[[Inception]]'', where by a [[forced perspective]] trick an immobile stairway changes its connectivity.

==Perspective projection==
{{Main|Perspective (graphical)}}
[[File:Distance point.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Perspective of a geometric solid using two vanishing points. In this case, the map of the solid (orthogonal projection) is drawn below the perspective, as if bending the ground plane.]]
[[File:Axonometric scheme.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Axonometric projection of a scheme displaying the relevant elements of a vertical [[picture plane]] perspective. The standing point (P.S.) is located on the ground plane ''π'', and the point of view (P.V.) is right above it. P.P. is its projection on the picture plane ''α''. L.O. and L.T. are the horizon and the ground lines (''linea d'orizzonte'' and ''linea di terra''). The bold lines '''s''' and '''q''' lie on ''π'', and intercept ''α'' at ''Ts'' and ''Tq'' respectively. The parallel lines through P.V. (in red) intercept L.O. in the vanishing points ''Fs'' and ''Fq'': thus one can draw the projections '''s′''' and '''q′''', and hence also their intersection '''R′''' on '''R'''.]]

Perspective projection is a linear projection where three dimensional objects are projected on a ''picture plane''. This has the effect that distant objects appear smaller than nearer objects. 

It also means that lines which are parallel in nature (that is, meet at the [[point at infinity]]) appear to intersect in the projected image, for example if railways are pictured with perspective projection, they appear to converge towards a single point, called [[vanishing point]]. Photographic lenses and the human eye work in the same way, therefore perspective projection looks most realistic.&lt;ref&gt;D. Hearn, &amp; M. Baker (1997). ''Computer Graphics, C Version''. Englewood Cliffs: Prentice Hall], chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; Perspective projection is usually categorized into ''one-point'', ''two-point'' and ''three-point perspective'', depending on the orientation of the projection plane towards the axes of the depicted object.&lt;ref&gt;James Foley (1997). ''Computer Graphics''. Boston: Addison-Wesley. {{ISBN|0-201-84840-6}}], chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphical projection methods rely on the duality between lines and points, whereby two straight lines determine a point while two points determine a straight line. The orthogonal projection of the eye point onto the picture plane is called the ''principal vanishing point'' (P.P. in the scheme on the left, from the Italian term ''punto principale'', coined during the renaissance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=Kirsti Andersen |authorlink= Kirsti Andersen |title=The geometry of an art |isbn=9780387259611 |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |url=https://books.google.com/books?printsec=frontcover&amp;id=8B_JeMxNUIkC&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two relevant points of a line are:
*its intersection with the picture plane, and
*its vanishing point, found at the intersection between the parallel line from the eye point and the picture plane.

The principal vanishing point is the vanishing point of all horizontal lines perpendicular to the picture plane. The vanishing points of all horizontal lines lie on the [[horizon]] line. If, as is often the case, the picture plane is vertical, all vertical lines are drawn vertically, and have no finite vanishing point on the picture plane. Various graphical methods can be easily envisaged for projecting geometrical scenes. For example, lines traced from the eye point at 45° to the picture plane intersect the latter along a circle whose radius is the distance of the eye point from the plane, thus tracing that circle aids the construction of all the vanishing points of 45° lines; in particular, the intersection of that circle with the horizon line consists of two ''distance points''. They are useful for drawing chessboard floors which, in turn, serve for locating the base of objects on the scene. In the perspective of a geometric solid on the right, after choosing the principal vanishing point —which determines the horizon line— the 45° vanishing point on the left side of the drawing completes the characterization of the (equally distant) point of view. Two lines are drawn from the orthogonal projection of each vertex, one at 45° and one at 90° to the picture plane. After intersecting the ground line, those lines go toward the distance point (for 45°) or the principal point (for 90°). Their new intersection locates the projection of the map. Natural heights are measured above the ground line and then projected in the same way until they meet the vertical from the map.

The '''''Hamburg Dramaturgy''''' ({{lang-de|Hamburgische Dramaturgie}}) is a highly influential work on [[drama]] by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]], written between 1767 and 1769.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arons|first=Wendy|last2=Baldyga|first2=Natalya|last3=Chemers|first3=Michael M.|last4=Figal|first4=Sara|date=2014-06-30|title=The "Open-Sourced" Hamburg Dramaturgy: A Twenty-first-Century Invitation to Interact with an Eighteenth-Century Work in Progress|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/548667|journal=Theatre Topics|volume=24|issue=2|pages=145–148|doi=10.1353/tt.2014.0026|issn=1086-3346}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not originally conceived as a unified and systematical book, but rather as series of essays on the theater, which Lessing wrote as commentary on the short-lived [[Hamburg National Theatre|Hamburg National Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/833404656|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing : his life, works, and thought|last=Barr)|first=Nisbet, H. B. (Hugh|date=2013|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199679478|edition= 1st|location=Oxford|oclc=833404656}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collection of 101 short essays represents one of the first sustained critical engagements with the potential of theater as a vehicle for the advancement of humanistic discourse. In many ways, the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy'' defined the new field of [[dramaturgy]], and also introduced the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-due.de/einladung/Vorlesungen/dramatik/lessingdra.htm|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing: Hamburgische Dramaturgie (1767)|publisher=[[University of Duisburg]]|language=German|accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time Lessing wrote the ''Hamburg Dramaturgy,'' there was a new movement of German theatre, based on self-reflection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Luckhurst|first1=Mary|title=Dramaturgy: A Revolution in Theatre|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actors were beginning to perform the inner and outer lives of their characters at the same time. One of Lessing's most famous and renowned quotes from the compilation considers the responsibilities of the actor and the playwright: “The great discernment of the drama critic lies in his ability to distinguish, whenever he feels pleasure or displeasure, to what extent that feeling should be credited to the writer or to the actor”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/notice/|title=Lessing’s Preface to the "Hamburg Dramaturgy" {{!}} Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a journal with Lessing as a dramatic critic to reflect on the Hamburg National Theater's efforts was conceived by the theatre's founder [[Johann Friedrich Löwen]], and [[Abel Seyler]], "the power behind the throne," who at first reluctantly agreed, but was eventually won over by the journal's success.&lt;ref&gt;George Freedley, John A. Reeves, ''A history of the theatre'', Crown Publishers, 1968, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/833404656|title=Gotthold Ephraim Lessing : his life, works, and thought|last=Nisbet|first=H.

Topics covered by Lessing in the series of essays include Aristotle's theory of tragedy, acting theory, the role of theater in society, the means by which theater achieves its emotional effects, criticism of the actor and the play, issues of translation, and a nascent theory of the psychology of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldyga|first=Natalya|date=May 2017|title=Corporeal Eloquence and Sensate Cognition: G.

== Analysis of actors ==

The analysis of the actor, according to Lessing, is grey area for a dramaturge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mcpress.media-commons.org/hamburg/essay-101-102-103-104/|title=Essay 101, 102, 103, &amp; 104 {{!}} Hamburg Dramaturgy {{!}} MediaCommons Press|last=|first=|date=|website=mcpress.media-commons.org|at=§17|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to know that with an actor's performance, the circumstances are a large factor to the performance, whereas, for example, the text itself is easier to judge because it simply involves literary analysis. When analyzing an actor's performance, current events, environment, and mentality of the actor must all be taken into account. When Lessing published his essays, numerous actors from Hamburg plays were upset with Lessing's carelessness and disregard of their talents in his essay.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Stegemann, “On German dramaturgy.” In The Routledge Companion to Dramturgy, ed. Magda Romanska (New York: Routledge, 2015), 45.

'''Hardi''' (born May 26, 1951, [[Blitar]], ([[East Jawa]]) is an Indonesian  artist, a member of the [[Indonesian new art movement|New Art Movement]] ({{lang-id | Gerakan Seni Rupa Baru}}).&lt;ref&gt;Miklouho-Maklai, Brita. Society's Wounds. Some Aspects of Contemporary Indonesian Art Since 1966. Kuala Lumpur: Vin Zin Press Sdn. Bhd, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brief biography ==
In 1971-1974 he studied at the Academy of Fine Arts of Indonesia in [[Yogyakarta]], in 1975-1977 - at the Academy of Jan van Eyck in [[Maastricht]]  (Netherlands). The first solo exhibition (1976) was also held there. One of the founders of the Cultural Forum of Jakarta ({{lang-id | Formja}}, Sept. 2015). His first three paintings were sold in 1970 to a small shop owned by a certain Neka, who later turned into one of the largest art dealers in Indonesia.

== Creativity ==
His first pictures reflected social protest in accordance with the ideas of the New Art Movement  of which he was a member. In 1978, he was arrested for a photo collage depicting the artist in a general form with the title "President of 2001. Suhardi". But soon he was released with the help of the Vice-President [[Malik, Adam]], art lover.&lt;ref&gt;Pogadaev, V. Malay World (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore). Lingvostranovedchesky dictionary. M.: "The Eastern Book", 2012, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;

Later he became an adherent of expressionism. There are numerous portrait works made by the artist (for example, the portrait of [[Raden Saleh]] or the president [[Joko Widodo]]) and paintings on mythological subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah M. Marzuki. Maestro Hardi, Seni, dan Politik. - "Media Indonesia", 21.8.2016&lt;/ref&gt;

He is also a master of making [[kris]]es.

He held 16 personal exhibitions in different countries. Since 2009, he is an active member of the working committee of the Congress of Culture of Indonesia. The artist's paintings are kept in the museums of [[Jakarta]] and [[Bali]], in private collections. June 17–26, 2011 in Jakarta there was held his personal retrospective exhibition "Art and Politics" in connection with the 60th anniversary of the artist.

The artist's works are of acute social character.&lt;ref&gt;Abdullah M. Marzuki. "Maestro Hardi, Seni, dan Politik". - "Media Indonesia", August 21, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of his works served as the basis for the cover designs of several books published in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;"A Balinese dancer" in Тауфик Исмаил. ''Верните мне Индонезию. Избранные стихи''.

[[File:DalserfHogback.jpg|thumb|300px|A hogback in [[Dalserf]] Churchyard, Scotland. The stone was found on the site in 1897.]]
'''Hogbacks''' are [[rock (geology)|stone]] carved [[Anglo-Scandinavian]] [[sculpture]]s from 10th- to 12th-century [[England]] and [[Scotland]]. Singular hogbacks were found in [[Ireland]] and [[Wales]]. Hogbacks fell out of fashion by the beginning of the 11th century. Their function is generally accepted as [[Grave (burial)|grave]] markers.

==Geography and description==
Hogbacks take the form of recumbent monuments, generally with a curved ('hogbacked') ridge, often also with outwardly curved sides. This shape, and the fact that they are frequently decorated with 'shingles' on either side of the central ridge, show that they are stylised 'houses' for the dead. The 'house' is of a Scandinavian type. One theory is that hogbacks originated among the [[Danish people|Danish]] settlers who occupied [[northern England]] in the 870s after the fall of the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]]. However, there is not sufficient research to prove or disprove this.

It has been suggested that the monument-type was invented about 920. There are particular concentrations of hogbacks in [[Yorkshire]], [[Cumbria]], and Govan on the Clyde- the former being their likely area of origin. Individual examples are found over a much wider area, however, from [[Derbyshire]] to Central [[Scotland]].  The presence of hogbacks in Scotland is likely due to the Forth-Clyde route, which connected York, England to Dublin. Most hogback sites in Scotland are along maritime routes.

English hogback sites do not follow this same trajectory. There are stray examples as far afield as the [[Northern Isles]], [[Orkney]] and [[Cornwall]].&lt;ref&gt;In the churchyard of [[Lanivet]] is a rare example of a hogback grave dating from Viking times.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ireland]] has a single example at [[Castledermot]], [[County Kildare]], which is similar to two hogbacks in [[Ingleby Arncliffe]], North Yorkshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lang |first=J. T. |title=The Castledermot Hogback |journal=The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland |volume=101 |issue=2 |date=1971 |pages=154–158 |JSTOR=25549768}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wales also has a single example at Llanddewi Aberarth Church.

The most numerous collections are the ones preserved in St Thomas's church of [[Brompton, Hambleton|Brompton]], [[Yorkshire]]. Discovered in 1867 following the restoration of the church, six were taken to [[Durham Cathedral]] Library leaving four whole ones and fragments of others at Brompton. They are characterized by carvings of bears hugging the slabs with strapwork in their mouths. Elsewhere five are in the [[Govan Old Parish Church|parish kirk]] of [[Govan]], once a rural parish, but now part of [[Glasgow]]. There is a fine example in the visitor centre on [[Inchcolm]] island in the [[Firth of Forth]].

==Typology==
There are two main types of Hogbacks. One is the Brompton type, which is characterized by massive end beasts. The other type is the warrior's tomb, which looks more like a house. It does not have massive end beasts.&lt;ref name=Bailey &gt;Bailey, R. N. (1980). ''Viking Age Sculpture in Northern England'', London: Collins Archaeology {{ISBN|0-00-216228-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the two main groups of hogback styles are smaller subsets. The scroll type hogback is a subset of the warrior's tomb type. It is characterized by scroll motifs on the horizontal band below the tegulation.&lt;ref name=Lang &gt;Lang, James T. "Hogback monuments in Scotland." In Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 105, 1972, pp. 206-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hogbacks at Govan==
Govan sits on the south bank of the Clyde River. It has the four largest known hogbacks. There are five hogbacks at Govan Parish Church. The earliest has been dated to the mid-tenth century. It has two rows of tegulation with concave, contoured lines. It has a band of interlace beneath the rows of shingles. The interlace pattern is not the same on either side. It is not continuous on either side. This is the only hogback at Govan with stopped-plait interlacing. The stopped plait on this hogback is characterized by a series of small, separated elements with pellet fillers. It also has a running ring-knot interlace with frets. On the other side, the sections of four-cord plait are stylistically reduced to a contoured diagonal bar crossed with a bar and four small pellets flanking it.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;

The later four hogbacks at Govan are dated to the end of the 10th century. The longest hogback at Govan does not have the decorative motifs that its earlier brother has. It is covered in rows of shingles, but they are not contoured. It is wider with a shallower roof pitch. The third hogback is massive. It has a full-bodied, 3-dimensional end-beast with legs. This single animal straddles the monument from one end to the other. The fourth hogback is also characterized by a single end-beast. Its head faces outward, an uncommon feature in hogbacks. The animal's four bent legs point toward its head. The roof ridges resemble a spine and the rows of tegulation are like scales. The fifth hogback has two end-beasts, one at either end. The beasts' faces and bodies are shown in profile with jaws gaping open, their legs intersecting along the base. This is the only known hogback with end-beasts in this position.&lt;ref name=Lang /&gt;

The '''Hunterston Brooch''' is a highly important [[Celtic brooch]] of "pseudo-penannular" type found near [[Hunterston]], [[North Ayrshire]], Scotland, in either, according to one account, 1826 by two men from [[West Kilbride]], who were digging drains at the foot of Goldenberry Hill,&lt;ref name="lamb92"&gt;Lamb, page 92&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1830.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 92&lt;/ref&gt; It is now in the [[National Museum of Scotland]], [[Edinburgh]].  Made within a few decades of 700 AD,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;NMS&lt;/ref&gt; the Hunterston Brooch is cast in silver, [[gilding|gilt]], and set with pieces of [[amber]] (most now missing), and decorated with [[interlace (art)|interlaced]] animal bodies in gold [[filigree]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The diameter of the ring is 12.2&amp;nbsp;cm, and in its centre there is a cross and a golden [[Halo (religious iconography)|Glory]] representing the Risen [[Christ]], surrounded by tiny bird heads.  The pin, which is broken, can travel freely around the ring as far as the terminals, which was necessary for fastening; it is now 13.1&amp;nbsp;cm long, but was probably originally 15&amp;nbsp;cm or more.&lt;ref name="Youngs, 91"&gt;Youngs, 91&lt;/ref&gt;  

The brooch may have been made at a royal site, such as [[Dunadd]] in [[Argyll]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; though is more likely to have been made in Ireland, especially as its [[pseudo-penannular]] form is typical of Irish brooches, whereas the truly penannular form remained usual in Pictish brooches.&lt;ref name="Youngs, 91"/&gt;  On the other hand, its style is closely comparable to a terminal fragment of a penannular brooch found in [[Dunbeath]] in 1860 which probably was made in Scotland; craftsmen may have travelled across the area using the locally popular forms.&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 57&lt;/ref&gt; Lloyd and Jennifer Laing feel it was probably made in [[Dalriada]], and the Museum of Scotland say "The style of the brooch has Irish parallels, while the filigree resembles metalwork from England. The brooch was probably made in western Scotland where the two traditions were joined, or perhaps in Ireland by a craftsman trained in foreign techniques."&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 148; [http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/record.php?usi=000-100-036-198-C&amp;scache=1cnl3113a1&amp;searchdb=scran NMS database]&lt;/ref&gt;

The brooch has a complex construction typical of the most elaborate Irish brooches.  Panels of filigree work were created separately on gold trays, which were then fitted into the main silver-gilt body. On the reverse four panels of silver-gilt were also inserted; as in other examples like the [[Tara Brooch]] the decoration on the reverse uses older curvilinear "Celtic" motifs looking back to [[La Tène style]] Insular Celtic decoration, though on the Hunterston Brooch such motifs also appear on the front.&lt;ref name="Youngs, 91"/&gt; 

The back of the brooch has a scratched inscription in [[rune]]s in the [[Old Norse]] language, probably 10th century, "Melbrigda owns this brooch"; Maél Brigda, "devotee of [[Saint Bridgit|Bridgit]]" is a common Gaelic female name, though seen as male by other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Whitfield, Tara Brooch, 215; Youngs, 91-92, "an Irishman Melbrigda".&lt;/ref&gt;  Much later ownership inscriptions are not uncommon on elaborate Celtic brooches, often from [[Norse-Gael]] contexts.  The Hunterston Brooch is clearly an object of very high status, indicating the power and great prestige of its owner.  With the [[Tara Brooch]] in [[Dublin]], and the [[Londesborough Brooch]] in the [[British Museum]], it is considered one of the finest of over 50 highly elaborate Irish Celtic brooches to survive,&lt;ref&gt;Youngs, 90&lt;/ref&gt; and is "arguably the earliest of the ornate penannular brooches from Britain and Ireland".&lt;ref&gt;Laings, 148&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julia Emilie Neilson''' (12 June 1868 – 27 May 1957)&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; was an English actress best known for her numerous performances as Lady Blakeney in ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'', for her roles in many tragedies and historical romances, and for her portrayal of Rosalind in a long-running production of ''[[As You Like It]]''.

After establishing her reputation in a series of plays by [[W. S. Gilbert]] in 1888, Neilson joined the company of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], where she remained for five years, meeting her future husband, [[Fred Terry]] (brother to actresses [[Kate Terry|Kate]], [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]], [[Marion Terry|Marion]] and Florence Terry and great uncle of [[John Gielgud]]).  With Terry, she played in London and on tour for nearly three decades.  She was the mother of the actress [[Phyllis Neilson-Terry]] and actor [[Dennis Neilson-Terry]].

==Life and career==
Neilson was born in London, the only child of Alexander Ritchie Neilson, a jeweller, and his wife, Emilie Davis, a member of a family of five Jewish sisters, many of whose offspring became actresses.  Neilson's parents divorced shortly after her birth, and her father soon died, leaving her mother to struggle to support her child.  Her mother much later married a solicitor, William Morris, the widower of the actress Florence Terry, elder sister of the actor [[Fred Terry]], who had, by that time, married Neilson.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Roy, Donald. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35196 "Neilson, Julia Emilie (1868–1957)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Neilson was an indifferent student.  At the age of twelve, she was sent to a boarding school in [[Wiesbaden]], Germany, where she learned to speak French and German and began to study music, discovering that she excelled at this.  She returned to England to enter the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1884, at the age of fifteen, to study piano.  She soon discovered that she had a talent as a singer, winning the Llewellyn Thomas Gold Medal (1885), the Westmoreland Scholarship (1886) and the Sainton Dolby Prize (1886).  While at the Academy, in 1887, she sang at the [[St James's Hall]] and also played roles in amateur theatre.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Early stage career===
[[File:Miss Julia Neilson 1894.jpg|left|thumb|upright|''The Era Almanack'', 1894]]
Neilson met the dramatist [[W. S. Gilbert]], who cast her in her first professional stage appearance in March 1888.  She played Cynisca in a charity matinée of his play, ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], and later that year, in the same play, she was the lead character, Galatea, in a similar matinée at the [[Savoy Theatre]].  Gilbert suggested that the statuesque young woman concentrate her career on acting rather than singing, and he coached her on acting.  Her next role was Lady Hilda in a revival of Gilbert's ''[[Broken Hearts]]''.  Gilbert wrote the lyrics to a short song for her to sing during Act I, and she proposed that a fellow student of hers at the Royal Academy, [[Edward German]], should set it to music.  She then played Selene in a revival of Gilbert's ''[[The Wicked World]]''.  In November 1888, she created the role of Ruth Redmayne in [[Rutland Barrington]]'s production of Gilbert's ''[[Brantinghame Hall]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

These roles led to an invitation for Neilson to join [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]]'s company, in which she toured in ''Captain Swift'', ''The Red Lamp'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]''.  She remained with Tree's company for five years at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] as a tragedienne, beginning with the role of Julie de Noirville in ''A Man's Shadow'', which opened in September 1889.  In 1891, Neilson married another actor in the company, [[Fred Terry]], the brother of Gilbert's former protégée, [[Marion Terry]] (and the actresses [[Kate Terry|Kate]], [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]] and Florence Terry).  Neilson and her husband appeared together in [[Sydney Grundy]]'s translation of the French play ''A Village Priest'' and numerous other productions together with Tree's company, including ''Beau Austin'', ''[[Hamlet]]'', ''Peril'' and Gilbert's ''Comedy and Tragedy'' (1890).  She also played Drusilla Ives in ''The Dancing Girl'' (1891) by [[Henry Arthur Jones]], and Terry and Neilson's daughter [[Phyllis Neilson-Terry|Phyllis]] was born in 1892.  Neilson was soon back on stage as Lady Isobel in Jones's ''The Tempter'' (1893),&lt;ref&gt;Beerbohm Tree's New Play; ''The Tempter'', ''The New York Times'', 21 September 1893, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and created the role of Hester Worsley in [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[A Woman of No Importance]]'' (1893).&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; A review of Neilson's performance in the play ''Ballad Monger'' in 1890 declared: 
[[File:Julia Neilson w book.jpg|thumb|Postcard photo, 1890s]]
:Miss Neilson's really wonderful singing took the curtain up on the very keynote of the beautiful and pathetic play.  And to her singing no higher tribute can be paid.  One of these days, we do not doubt, it will be possible to write in the same strain about her acting.  In that there is splendid promise.  And the promise will come the more near to performance when she is a trifle less conscious of her remarkable physical beauty, and of the fact that she has been to some extent rushed into her present position.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Alec (pseudonym of Edward Aveling). [http://www.marxists.org/archive/eleanor-marx/1890/theatre.htm "Eleanor Marx and Edward Aveling 1890"], www.marxists.org, Eleanor Marx Archive, accessed 7 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1894, Neilson and Terry appeared together in ''Shall We Forgive Her?'' by Frank Harvey at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], with Neilson as Grace.  The next year, she played Lady Chiltern in Wilde's comedy ''[[An Ideal Husband]]'' at the Haymarket under the management of [[Lewis Waller]].  She gave birth to her second child, Dennis, in October 1895.  Two months later, the family travelled to America to perform with [[John Hare (actor)|John Hare]]'s company.  There they played together in New York in ''The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith'' by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]], with Neilson as Agnes.  In 1896, they returned to England where, at the [[St James's Theatre]], Neilson played Princess Flavia in ''[[The Prisoner of Zenda]]'' by [[Anthony Hope]], remaining at that theatre for two years.  There she played Rosalind in the extremely successful run of ''[[As You Like It]]'' (in which role she toured North America in 1895 and 1910).  She played the title role in Pinero's ''[[The Princess and the Butterfly]]'' in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;Fyfe, Hamilton. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GPMOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA247 ''Arthur Wing Pinero, Playwright: a Study''], 1902, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt; Her husband appeared with her in ''The Tree of Knowledge'' and other plays from October 1897 until the summer of 1898; her roles included Beatrice in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]''. Next, they appeared in ''The Gipsy Earl''.  Again with Tree's company, now at [[Her Majesty's Theatre]], Neilson was Constance in ''King John'' (1899) (and appeared in an early short silent movie recreating King John's death scene at the end of the play)&lt;ref&gt;"London Theatre Gossip", ''The New York Times'', 1 July 1899, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; and Oberon in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' (1900).  They then toured in ''As You Like It''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Later years===
The couple entered into management together in 1900, producing and starring in ''[[Sweet Nell of Old Drury]]'' by [[Paul Kester]].&lt;ref&gt;"Theatre Royal This Day&amp;nbsp;– Miss Julia Neilson and Mr. Fred Terry", ''Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advisor'', 28 November 1900, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; They would continue to produce plays together for the next 30 years, most notably, ''[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]'' (1905 at the [[Noël Coward Theatre|New Theatre]]), which they also starred in and, with J. M. Barstow, adapted for the stage from [[Baroness Orczy]]'s manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;"Miss Julia Neilson at the Theatre Royal Tonight", ''Manchester Courier and Lancashire General Advisor'', 5 September 1905, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Despite scathing reviews from the critics, the play was a record-breaking hit and played for more than 2,000 performances, then enjoying numerous revivals.

[[File:Julia Neilson, circa 1920.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Neilson, c. 1920, by [[Reginald Grenville Eves|R. G. Eves]]]]
Neilson's roles also included the title role in Kester's adaptation of ''[[Dorothy Vernon of Haddon Hall]]'' (1907). Neilson's and Terry's productions continued to favour historical romances or comedy melodramas, including ''Henry of Navarre'' by William Devereux (1909 at the New Theatre). ''Henry'' and ''Sweet Nell'' became their signature pieces during many tours of the British provinces and during their US tour in 1910. They also produced and starred with much success in ''For Sword or Song'' by Robert Legge and [[Louis Calvert]] (1903),&lt;ref&gt;"For Sword or Song", ''The New York Times'', 22 January 1903, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dorothy o' the Hall'' by Paul Kester and [[Charles Major (writer)|Charles Major]] (1906), ''The Popinjay'' by Boyle Lawrence and Frederick Mouillot (1911), ''Mistress Wilful'' by Ernest Hendrie (1915), ''The Borderer'' (1921), ''The Marlboroughs'' (1924),&lt;ref&gt;"Amusements and Exhibitions", ''Western Daily Press'', 21 November 1924, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Wooing of Katherine Parr'' by William Devereux (1926). They also starred in ''A Wreath of a Hundred Roses'' (1922), which was a [[masque]] by [[Louis N. Parker]] at the Duke's Hall to celebrate the Royal Academy's centenary.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1926, Neilson starred alongside [[Lawrence Grossmith]] in a revival of ''Henry of Navarre'', which toured the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;"Amusements at the Theatre Royal", ''Nottingham Evening Post'', 13 September 1926, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; She later starred in ''This Thing Called Love'' in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;"Amusements and Exhibitions", ''Western Daily Press'', 21 November 1929, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Her son Dennis died of pneumonia in 1932,&lt;ref&gt;"Dennis Neilson-Terry Dead in South Africa", ''The New York Times'', 15 July 1932, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and her husband, Fred Terry, died in 1933.  Neilson retired from the stage after a run as Josephine Popinot in the revival of the farce ''Vintage Wine'' by [[Seymour Hicks]] and [[Ashley Dukes]] at [[Daly's Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;"By Cable and Courier", ''The New York Times'', 20 May 1934, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, she was given a testimonial luncheon to mark her fiftieth anniversary as a performer. Neilson made a brief return to the stage in 1944 to play Lady Rutven in ''The Widow of 40'' by [[Heron Carvic]]. She wrote a memoir entitled, ''This For Remembrance'', which gives an account of her life in the theatre business. Her children with Terry, [[Phyllis Neilson-Terry|Phyllis]] and [[Dennis Neilson-Terry|Dennis]], were both actors.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

Neilson died in a hospital in Hampstead, London, after a fall at her home, in 1957 at the age of 88. She was cremated at [[Golders Green]], and she and her husband are both buried at [[Hampstead Cemetery]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;"Julia Neilson-Terry, 88; Well-Known Actress on Stage in Britain, 1888–1944, Dies", ''The New York Times'', 28 May 1957, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kopel Gurwin''' ({{lang-he|קופל גורבין}}) (1923–1990) was an [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[wall hanging]] artist, painter and graphic artist.

==Family and youth==
Kopel (Kopke') Gurwin (Gurwitz) was born and raised in [[Vilna]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; His father Mordechai worked as a shoemaker and his mother Malka as a housekeeper. Kopel and his siblings, Moshe (Meshke') who was two and a half years his elder, and Chava (Chavale’) who was four years younger, spoke [[Yiddish]] at home, but simultaneously studied Hebrew at their school which was part of the [[Tarbut]] educational network. 
&lt;ref&gt;Art Exhibition at Aaron", American Jewish World, Minneapolis Minn, May 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kopel was active in the [[Hashomer Hatzair]] youth movement. In the 1930s, as a teenager, Kopel helped his parents with the home finances by working in a suit workshop, there he first encountered the art of sewing.
&lt;ref&gt;"Foundation Sponsors Works by Kopel Gurwin", [[Jewish Standard]], N.J., June 11, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of the [[Second World War]] and the German invasion of Vilna, the Jews were imprisoned in camps and [[ghetto]]s. Kopel and his brother Moshe were separated from their parents and were put to work in [[Coal mining|coal mines]] and [[peat]]. Kopel's parents were taken to the [[Stutthof concentration camp]] where they died of [[typhus]] within a month of each other. Kopel's 12-year-old sister Chava was turned over to the Germans by a Polish family and murdered.

The brothers were arrested by the Germans, but were saved thanks to the connections of Nina Gerstein, Kopel's drama teacher. They hid in an attic until they were discovered, fled and moved to [[Riga]], where they were caught and sent to the Stutthof concentration camp where they were imprisoned until the end of the war. They were put to work maintaining and cleaning trains and took part in one of the [[death marches]]. 
&lt;ref&gt;Art Exhibition at Aaron", American Jewish World, Minneapolis Minn, May 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An interview with Kopel Gurwin, "Kopel captures the spirit of life", Outlook Women's League, vol. 59. No. 2, winter 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;
In July 1946, Kopel and Moshe sailed to [[Helsingborg]], Sweden, as part of operation "[[Folke Bernadotte]]", in which Sweden took in ill survivors for rehabilitation. Once he recovered, Kopel worked in a publishing house and later was appointed director of the local branch of the [[HeHalutz|Halutz]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", [[Haaretz]], 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An interview with Kopel Gurwin, "Kopel captures the spirit of life", Outlook Women's League, vol. 59. No. 2, winter 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Kopel and Moshe made [[aliyah]] to Israel. Kopel worked as a survey for the Survey of Israel Company. In 1951, he enlisted to the Communication Corps and served as a military [[Technical drawing|draftsman]]. There he won first prize for the design of the front cover of the Communication Corps bulletin.&lt;ref&gt;Kopel Gurwin: The artist and his creation 1990-1923, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginning of artistic career==
With his discharge from the army at 29 he started studying drawing and graphics at the [[Bezalel]] Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. Among his teachers were [[Isidor Ascheim]], Shlomo Vitkin, Yossi Stern and [[Jacob Steinhardt]].&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, [[Yedioth Ahronoth]] Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of his first year of study, Kopel won the Reuben and Sarah Lif Excellence Award in written studies. During his studies he also won additional prizes: In 1956 he won first prize from the Lethem Foundation in California for poster design. Later the same year, Kopel won the Herman Shtruk prize for his drawing on the theme of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee Colored", [[Ma'ariv]], 27 January 1960, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957 he won an additional first prize from the Lethem Foundation and second place from the printing company Ortzel for a drawing for a [[Rosh Hashanah|Jewish New Year]] [[greeting card]]. In 1958 he won first prize in a competition to design a poster for Tel Aviv's jubilee.&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee Colored", Ma'ariv, 27 January 1960, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later he won three other awards: First and third prize for designing a poster for Israel Independence Day, celebrating 12 years of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;"Two won the Independence Day poster competition", [[Davar]], 26 January 1960, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Three graphic artists won prizes totaling 2100 Israeli Pounds for Independence Day posters", [[Herut (newspaper)|Herut]], 1 February 1960, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Individuals and Institutions", Ma'ariv, 26 January 1960, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Coffee Colored", Ma'ariv, 27 January 1960, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also that year Kopel won first prize for a poster to mark the 25th [[World Zionist Congress|Zionist Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 he entered the [[Independence Day (Israel)|Independence Day]] poster competition on the theme of [[aliyah]] and won first and second prize. 
&lt;ref&gt;"A menorah under a ship and rising figures – an Independence Day poster", Davar, 30 January 1964, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"An Independence Day poster was chosen", Ma'ariv, 30 January 1964, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davar, 31 January 1964, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Independence Day poster prize", Haaretz, 30 January 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
Four years later he again entered the competition on the theme of 20 years of Israel's independence and won first prize. The poster was styled like a Holy Ark curtain with two lions and a menorah at its centre. This poster appeared on the cover of Jewish Art and Civilization, edited by Geoffrey Wigoder,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Vigoder (ed.), Jewish art and civilization, Walker and company, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Frankenstein, Jewish art… and a freak show", S.F.

In April 1971 he won first prize in the Independence Day poster competition for the fourth time.&lt;ref&gt;"Prizes for excellence in the Ministry of Communications", Ma'ariv, 12 February 1971, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adam Baruch]], "A Poster for Every Occasion", Haaretz, 9 April 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wall hangings==
[[File:Kopel_Tapestry_of_Jerusalem_1968.jpg|right|160px|thumb|Kopel's tapestry that won the Israeli Independence Day Poster Contest in 1968]]
With the completion of his studies at [[Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design|Bezalel]] Kopel moved to Tel Aviv and was hired by Shmuel Grundman's graphics and design studio. Grundman took him to Europe with him to design and supervise the construction of Israeli exhibition pavilions.&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time at Grundman's he discovered the fibrous felt from which he produced most of his wall hangings.&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1964 [[Levant Fair]] exhibition he used felt stuck onto wooden panels for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first felt wall hanging that Kopel produced was intended for the American Cultural Centre in Jerusalem and its theme was the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. The wall hanging, which measured 2.85 X 1.85 meters, was stuck on a wooden panel. Kopel ordered rolls of felt from France and began work on wall hangings based on bible stories. He used a needle, hand sewing small even stitches with black embroidery thread which framed and highlighted every detail in the work, as well as using [[appliqué]]. Each wall hanging was constructed of three elements: the main motif/ story, the decoration (ornamentation) and the Hebrew text which usually framed the work. The lettering was designed in a square font contrary to the accepted biblical [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;Pnina Silberstein, "Color, Marble and Felt Cuttings", Our Country, Issue 2, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An interview with Kopel Gurwin, "Kopel captures the spirit of life", Outlook Women's League, vol. 59. No. 2, winter 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The interior designer, Alufa Koljer-Elem, introduced him to [[Ruth Dayan]] who managed the shop Maskit and initiated the establishment of the Maskit 6 gallery. On the 10th September 1967 he opened his first solo exhibition at the Maskit 6 gallery, in which 12 wall hangings were displayed.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ohad, "The Eyes of Saul, David's Pedigree and Jacob's Ladder", Haaretz, 22 September 1967, p. 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art Exhibition at Aaron", American Jewish World, Minneapolis Minn, May 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;An interview with Kopel Gurwin, "Kopel captures the spirit of life", Outlook Women's League, vol. 59.

In light of the exhibition at Maskit 6, Meira Gera, the director of artistic activity at the [[America-Israel Cultural Foundation]], organized an additional exhibition of his works at the foundation's exhibition hall in [[New York City]]. The exhibition sparked immense press interest,&lt;ref&gt;"Gurwin works to be shown", American examiner, June 10, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art Exhibition at Aaron", American Jewish World, Minneapolis Minn, May 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Kopel Gurwin art will be displayed soon", Jewish transcript, June 17, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American examiner, June 24, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Survivor's art on display", Jews New, June 11, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Foundation shows works by artist Kopel Gurwin", Jews Chronicle, June 11, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vernon N.Y., June 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the exhibition at the Delson-Richter gallery in Old Jaffa,&lt;ref&gt;Moshe Ben-Shaul, "Carpets of Beauty", Ma'ariv, 21 August 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Decorative Wall Hangings", Davar, 29 August 1975, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Delson-Richter Gallery, Evening Evening, 10 August 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; which was later also exhibited at the Jerusalem Theatre,&lt;ref&gt;"Kopel Gurwin at the Jerusalem Theatre", Yedioth Ahronoth, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miriam Tal, "Kopel Gurwin at the Jerusalem Theatre, Yedioth Ahronoth, 17 October 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Art Exhibition at Aaron", American Jewish World, Minneapolis Minn, May 28, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt; the journalist Nissim Mevorah wrote:
:"The black color connecting the felt to the upholstery fabric (through hand stitching) highlights the contours. The aforementioned process repeats itself several times since every [[tapestry]] is composed of at least three layers. Color attracts color, until the completion of the work. Thanks to this technique, his work goes beyond purely technical art and borders on artistic action. The colorfulness inherent in the felt is luscious and rich. This is the reason Gurwin selected this material for his works. He has a highly developed sense of color and thanks to this his works look as though they are being engulfed by red and blue flames. The [[biblical]] characters filling Gurwin's wall hangings are inspired by the [[Jewish art]]istic [[folklore]] of Eastern Europe. Around the biblical verse which adorns the characters like a crown, appear oriental decorative motifs based on the rhythm of repetitive forms. By contrast, even contemporary graphic styles, among them the works of great artists such as [[Paul Klee]], are among the influences on these wall hangings. At times of heavenly mercy Gurwin prepared works based on psalms of thanksgiving. His romantic moods resulted in tapestries dedicated to the Song of Songs."&lt;ref&gt;Nissim Mevorah, "Carpets in Flames", Haaretz, 15 August 1975, p. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974 Kopel was approached by the women of the Beth Shalom Congregation (Sisterhood) in [[Kansas City]], USA, with a request to design a wall hanging 5.40 X 2.70 meters in size. The intention was for a tapestry that the community women could be involved in its production. Kopel designed the work in all its detail and sent precise execution instructions for the wall hanging which was designed as a tapestry around the theme of the [[Garden of Eden]]. Following approval of the sketch, Kopel received 50 pieces of special canvas for tapestry embroidery, as well as a catalogue of wool thread with 200 shades. He connected the pieces into a large tapestry, enlarged his sketch and prepared precise instructions for each embroiderer. He then dismantled the tapestry into pieces and sent the pieces of fabric to the women congregants. 70 women took part in sewing the tapestry and completed together 2 million stitches over two years. 
&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Fredman, Israeli artist Kopel Gurwin is known for creative tapestry", St. Louis Jewish Light, May 6, 1981, p, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jaekel Miller, The Kansas City star, "Needlepoint Tapestry a Co-operative Project", Section c, People, January 30, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article about the project, Barbara Jaekel Miller, previously editor at [[The Times]], wrote:
:"Kopel's genius is in his colors. To think that the huge tapestry was designed from a catalogue of wool threads without the artist being able to see the stages of construction. The final product is perfect, almost unimaginable." &lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jaekel Miller, The Kansas City star, "Needlepoint Tapestry a Co-operative Project", Section c, People, January 30, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

An additional appliqué, 4.0 X 2.0 meters in size, hangs in the Church of the Good Samaritan in Miami. The subject of the tapestry was the seven days of creation. All the days of creation were written in English apart from the seventh day which Kopel ended with the word "Halleluiah" in Hebrew.

Kopel's tapestry "The Time for Singing has Arrived" was printed on a [[UNICEF]] greeting card in 1978 and again in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Fredman, Israeli artist Kopel Gurwin is known for creative tapestry", St. Louis Jewish Light, May 6, 1981, p, 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 the company Kol Ha’Tor LTD, whose main goal was to deal with manufacture, marketing and sale of "artistic works from fabric", was established. 
 
The Israeli [[Philatelic]] Service issued three stamps based on three of Kopel's holy arc curtains and one stamp based on an [[Independence Day (Israel)|Independence Day]] poster he designed.

Kopel's creations decorate a large number of synagogues, public buildings, hotels and private collections which were purchased in Israel and around the world. They have decorated, among others, the walls of the [[King David Hotel]] in Jerusalem, the [[VIP]] room at [[Ben Gurion Airport]], the Kfar Saba theatre and the Plaza Hotel in Tel Aviv.&lt;ref&gt;Shosh Moran, Yedioth Ahronoth Weekly "Netanya Hadera", Issue No. 400, June 1988, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
At the end of the 1960s Kopel met Hannah Brooks, who worked in [[textile]] design for industry and wove artistic cloths for [[fashion designers]]. The two participated in artistic projects for hotels and public buildings. In September 1974 they wed. in 1980 they moved to [[Beit Yanai]].

Kopel Gurwin passed away at the age of 67 as a result of [[heart disease]]. He was survived by his wife, Hannah and their two children, Boaz and Shira.&lt;ref&gt;Kopel Gurwin: The artist and his creation 1990-1923, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1404">'''Lament of the Holy Cross''' (Polish: '''Lament swietokrzyski''') is a medieval Polish [[planctus]], written by unknown author probably in late 15th century. It now is regarded as one of lyrical masterpieces of the era. Literary historians emphasize the fact that the Lament presents [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] almost as a human being, with feelings and emotions. Most likely, the text used to be part of the [[Good Friday]] mysterium. 

Lament of the Holy Cross is the monologue of Mary, who is painful and mourns her son [[Jesus Christ]], standing under his cross. At first, she calls on people standing around her, urging them to show compassion and understanding. She then turns to her son, hoping to ease his sufferings and get closer to him. Later Mary gets angry and rebellious, and the text is completed with an appeal to all mothers to pray to God for their sons. 

The Lament comes from the Benedictine Monastery at [[Lysa Gora]] in the [[Holy Cross Mountains]], and was probably written in ca. 1470.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16731">[[File:Laurent Gervereau selfportrait.jpg|thumb|Laurent Gervereau]]
'''Laurent Gervereau''' (born 1956, in [[Paris]]) is a [[France|French]] artist, novelist, [[philosophy|philosopher]] and filmmaker.  The founder of the discipline of [[Visual History]] (or ''Histiconologia''),&lt;ref&gt;Gervereau, Laurent.  ''Images, une histoire mondiale''.  Paris: Nouveau monde, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; he has devoted his professional life to the world of images, as well as to the direction of cultural and international institutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agroparistech.fr/+Musee-du-Vivant-all-around-the+.html]. Accessed 10 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic career==

Gervereau has been actively engaged in the art world since the 1970s, having participated in exhibitions with several notable [[Surrealism (art)|surrealists]] ([[Philippe Soupault]], [[Belgium|Belgian]] or [[Czechoslovakia|Czech]] surrealists, Mirabelle Dors, Alfred Courmes, Maurice Rapin, [[Clovis Trouille]], etc.). His artistic and cultural interests include the [[Dada]] movement, [[Proudhon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Guy Debord]] and [[situationism|the situationist movement]]. He is a member of the [[Collège de 'Pataphysique]].

In 1977, he founded the [[pataphysics|pataphysico]]-situationnist review ''Aux poubelles de la Gloire'' with Guy Bodson.&lt;ref&gt;Bibl. : [ISSN 0399-9440&lt;/ref&gt; There were 13 issues and it finished in 1979. This was the beginning of his philosophy of relativity (''Pour une philosophie de la relativité'', 2010) against relativism. He then built his theories about cultural ecology, evolutionism, necessity of diversity and movement (''plurofuturo''), of choice between past and future (''retrofuturo'') and his struggle against those who have only one way to look at the world, inheritated from the past, and want to uniformise the entire planet (''monoretros'').

He began then his long novel called ''L'homme planétaire'' (end of the 1970s). The middle part of this triptych was published by Sens &amp; Tonka in 2001 with the title ''Ce livre n'est pas à lire'' (''This Book is Not to be Read''). It was chosen by the ''[[Les Inrockuptibles]]'' magazine and the radio channel [[France Culture]] as one of the seven best novels of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Les Inrockuptibles n°301, 21 août 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This book is an experiment in mixed media and local-global description in literature: the "crossmedialism". He will make the adaptation for manga of the third part of the tryptique with a Chinese artist Xin Ye ("Mixplanet", 2011).

In 1989, he built with Louis Rollinde a new artistic group with a new review in English and French: Painters of History (''Les Peintres d'histoire''). Exhibitions were held in Naples, Paris and Hanover. To struggle against the new maelstrom of images, he defended rarity in art and the difficulty to see with hidden images (''La Disparition des images'', 2003). So, he combines art actions or art productions and the creation of unique pieces ("Unik" movement which defends rarity and magic).

After he began to make short movies during the 1970s, he released eight movies. They are experimental documentaries belonging to the "cinema espresso" and were shown from 2009 to 2012 (and after). Official projections were made in January 2011 in the Reflet Médicis in Paris.

He agreed to become president of the See-socioecolo Network, founded in 2010 in Brazil and Canada ([http://see-socioecolo.com/ official website of the socioecolo evolutionnists]). In the end of  2012 he published ''LE LOCAL-GLOBAL. Changer soi pour changer la planète'' (''The Local-Global. Change yourself to change the Planet'') and was nicknamed for years "Mister Local-Global". Last but not least, in 2012, he made an artistic action in Hong Kong with the words: "economy is a belief". In France, he chose: "nostalgia = cancer".&lt;ref&gt;Interview in English on Radio Hong Kong 3, World Vibes 2012/11/10 (podcast http://programme.rthk.hk/channel/radio)&lt;/ref&gt; Other members act in Brazil and Canada, and in some other countries &lt;ref&gt;look at [http://see-socioecolo.com/official website of the socioecolo evolutionnists]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; for the World Campaign "Knowledge is beautiful".

He creates the local-global annual meeting in Argentat sur Dordogne (France): Les Rencontres-Promenades "Histoires de Passages...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://histoiresdepassages.com/official website of the Rencontres-Promenades]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cabu gave the drawing for the 1st edition (July 2015), which is his last poster, in December 2014.

==The scientific and professional aspects==

He first worked in bookshops and in a bank (Crédit Agricole) to get money to live. He made the choice on October 1, 1978, to work in a museum. It had two consequences: first, to act for the transformation of the patrimonial institutions all over the world (look at the networks part in networks section); second, made the choice to base his researches on all kind of images because he discovered that 98% of the pieces in the collections interested nobody. Then, became the specialist of the World History of Images or ''Histiconologia'' ([http://decryptimages.net.com/general website for cultural education]).

He became the curator of the Museum of Contemporary History (''Musée d'Histoire contemporaine de la Bibliothèque de documentation internationale contemporaine'') in 1991 where he did a lot of exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bdic.fr&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, he founded the International Association of Museums of History ([http://iamh-aimh.org/official website of the International Association of Museums of History]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}) and was the president for 14 years. In 1992, he founded the ''Group L'Image'' with [[Fabrice d'Almeida]], Antoine de Baecque, Philippe Buton, Christian Delporte, Laurence Bertrand Dorléac, and David El Kenz.  The review is distributed by [[Gallimard]] in France and [[Harvard University]] in the United States. There are many contributions such as his interview of [[Ernst Gombrich]] in London or [[Arturo Schwarz]] in Milan about [[Marcel Duchamp]]. International colloquiums were held ("Où va l'histoire de l'art contemporain?" / "Where does the History of Contemporary Art go?", "Peut-on apprendre à voir?" / "How to learn to see?", "Quelle est la place des images en histoire?" / "What is the Place of Images in History?" ) and websites were invented with the help of the French government or the European Commission (imagesmag.net, imageduc.net, primages.net) as CD-roms (collection [décrypter les images] |deciphere the images]). Now all these activities belong to the Institute of Images and [http://decryptimages.net/general website of cultural education]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

In the Museum of Contemporary History, he works with a lot of different researchers and artists. He built comparative exhibitions (Germany and France during the 1920s, Great Britain and France during the 1960s), exhibitions about foreign countries as Yugoslav space or Russia and USSR and also exhibitions about difficult subjects concerning French history: propaganda under the Vichy Government (1991), War in Algeria (1992), history of immigration, Dreyfus Affair, Deportation, Images and colonies etc. In 2001, he became director of the Museum of Cinema-Henri Langlois in the [[Cinémathèque française]] in Paris.

Every two years, he organized world congresses with different subjects ("How to organize a Multipolar World?", April 2004 in Brazil). He led the EUROCLIO Network about history of Europe and heritage, helped by the [[European Commission]] from 1999 to 2003 with numerous institutions from all countries of the European Union and more. He built the Museums of Europe Network, founding the review of comparatist history "Comparare" with [[Jacques Le Goff]], [[Eric Hobsbawm]], [[Carlo Ginzburg]], Rudolf von Thadden, [[Bronislaw Geremek]]. He wrote the book ''Vous avez dit musées? Tout savoir sur la crise culturelle'' / ''You said museums? To know everything about the cultural crisis'' ([[CNRS Editions]]).

Concerning the question of images, he published a lot of books during 30 years. The general bibliography (except articles and conferences) is on: [http://gervereau.com/ official website of Laurent Gervereau], look at "traces". Here are some main examples: about the method to analyse images, ''Voir, comprendre, analyser les images'' ([[La Découverte]]); with Cabu, educative comics for children, "Le monde des images. Comprendre les images pour ne pas se faire manipuler" ([[Robert Laffont]]); le ''Dictionnaire mondial des images''/ ''World Dictionary of Images'' (Nouveau monde); the general history of images, ''Images, une histoire mondiale'' (Nouveau monde/CNDP); ''Un siècle de manipulations par l'image'' (Somogy Editions d'art), ''Inventer l'actualité'' (La Découverte), ''La Guerre mondiale médiatique'' (Nouveau monde), the exhibition and the book ''Les images mentent? Manipuler les images ou manipuler le public'': [http://decryptimages.net/ general website for cultural education]. Some translations are done (in Portuguese and in Arabic), but there is still a lack for some important languages as English, Spanish or Chinese.

Gervereau is now the president of the Institut des Images and director of: [http://decryptimages.net/ general website for cultural education]. In July 2013, he created on this website a monthly cultural video magazine: [decryptcult].

In 2004, he became also the director of the International Museum of Ecology: ''Musée du Vivant'' ([http://agroparistech.fr/Musée du Vivant]). He created a world network in UNESCO during the Congress of December 2005 in Te Papa Museum (New Zealand): Ecology and Sustainable Development Network. He wrote in 2011 "Une histoire générale de l'écologie en images" ("A General History of Ecology in Images", about the relations between humanity and environment from prehistory). In 2012, he organized with Christian Delporte the international colloquium "Patrimoine de l'écologie et écologie du patrimoine" / "Heritage of Ecology, Ecology of Heritage".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.histecologia.net {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105154645/http://histecologia.net/ |date=2014-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Jacques Le Goff]], who directed Annales review [[Annales School]], wrote in the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' (December 15, 2006) about the ''World Dictionary of Images'': "President of the Institute of Images, Laurent Gervereau published a book that will be essential. He built a team to work on the question of all types of images, a team of exceptional specialists, artists or celebrated intellectuals or brilliant young researchers. We know that, after the last years of the 20th century, humanity has entered into the time of images. The sum realised by Gervereau is in the continuity of his book of method ''See, Understand, Analyse Images'' (La Découverte, first edition in 1994) and of the reflections about the new and fundamental object of the human contemporary reality, the visual, visual that he has studied through his book ''History of the Visual in the XXth Century'' (« Points histoire », Le Seuil, 2000). (...) Today, we entered with the Internet into the "Time of accumulation" and this book seems to be the first attempt to decode this new world of mass images in a global World."

=== Movies ===
Eight movies have been directed by Laurent Gervereau (1h45). They are distributed by [http://adav-assoc.com/distribution in France and abroad for Gervereau's movies]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:
* ''A travers les utopies'', road movie between France and Switzerland to see old places of utopias and to think how to change everyday life today
* ''La fabrique des images hybrides'', how all images were censored about the atomic effects in Hiroshima and Nagasaki and how United States and Europe inspired after that the Japonese culture to make through movies, manga, video games a visual mainstream culture
* ''L'info est-elle comestible?'', how we can understand the great crisis of medias through newspapers, TVs, websites, magazines, radios... Many interviews in France, Germany and Switzerland
* ''La pauvreté, c'est quoi?'' Only people from Mali speak about their everyday life, celebrated or not. So, it is a way to ask the questions of what poverty is, of what is the best way to live when we see that money makes moral disasters in United States or Europe. This film is a great lesson of relativity in order to respect every way to look at the world and to behave.
* ''Où sont les déchets?'' An experimental movie (almost nobody speaks) as a dream or a nightmare through India. A reflection about pollution, people rejected from the society (as Adivasis, Aborigens, considered as non human) and destruction, death, rebirth
* ''En attendant l'hiver... Climat et vie quotidienne chez les Inuit'' This film was done with the Inuit (extreme North of [[Nunavik]]). It shows the changes of life, the question of climate and its consequences, but also as Inuit do with collective property (of their houses or the supermarket), how they continue to hunt in this society where money was a complete nonsense, how they negotiate with the new mines and the big companies
* ''Politically InKorect! Noël Arnaud et Dada, Jarry, Picasso, Jorn, Duchamp, Debord, Vian, l'Oulipo...'' Interview, rare documents of this incredible author (Noël Arnaud) who was Dadaist in the 1930s (against Surrealism), was the leader of the Surrealist Group clandestine during the Second World War, promoted the "surréalisme révolutionnaire" before COBRA after the War, pronounced a conference in 1957 with Guy Debord and the situationists, was close to Fluxus or Boris Vian and the Pataphysicians... Debord speaks in the film as Constant (with a special interview). (2013)
* ''Spectateur'' − An experimental film: three days long looking at TV. A reflection about this dying media. The cemetery for a dead Infante. Goyesque movie. (2013)

The '''Museum of Russian Icons''' is a non-profit art museum located in [[Clinton, Massachusetts]], in the United States. The collection includes more than 1,000 [[Russian icons]] and related artifacts, making it one of the largest private collections of Russian icons outside of Russia and the largest in North America. The icons in the collection range in date from the 15th century through to the present and covers almost the entire range of Russian icon images, symbols, and forms. 

== History ==
[[Image:CVanderwarkerGT7X7942.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Interior of the Museum]]

The Museum opened in October 2006. It began as the private collection of Gordon B. Lankton, a plastics engineer and former chairman and CEO of Nypro, Inc., a precision injection molding company now owned by [[Jabil Circuit]]. Lankton has been an avid traveler since he was stationed in Germany when he was in the Army. As outlined in his book ''The Long Way Home'', Lankton took a motorcycle trip around the world in 1956 and 1957, visiting (in chronological order), Germany, Austria, Italy, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Nepal, Burma, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Philippines, Hong Kong, and Japan. According to Lankton, he had wanted to visit Russia but was not allowed to do so during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Russian Icons audio tour narration, accessed 1/2014&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Lankton first traveled to Russia to open a Nypro factory there. On that visit, he learned about iconographer Alyona Knyazeva and her icon school. After meeting Knyazeva and learning more about icons, Lankton began his collection, starting with a small, poor quality icon he found at a flea market in the [[Izmaylovo District]] of Moscow.

Over the following 30 years, Lankton amassed several hundred icons. He displayed them at his home, at Nypro in a small gallery, and occasionally on loan to other museums, including the [[Higgins Armory Museum]]. As the collection grew and response to the informal sharing of his collection proved positive, Lankton decided to open his own museum directly across the street from Nypro. The Museum was incorporated in 2004, and Lankton purchased the building in early 2006. It opened to the public on October 15, 2006. Since then, two major expansion projects have taken place: in 2008, a research library and the South Gallery were added. In 2010, Lankton purchased the building immediately next door to the Museum and undertook a construction project to seamlessly join the two structures. The first phase of this project included the West Gallery and an expanded Museum Shop; the second phase included an expanded lower level with the Tea Room and auditorium.

== Building ==
Both buildings that now make up the single museum property were originally associated with the [[Bigelow Carpet Mill]]. The second building, previously 195 Union Street, also served at one time as both the Clinton District Court and the Police Station. Both buildings were completely renovated on the interiors by David Durrant of Durrant Designs. Some historical details were retained and renovated, including the jail cells that were once part of the police station; and the period window frames in the West Gallery. The building now has more than 16,000 square feet of gallery space on three floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museumofrussianicons.org/about-us.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606215524/http://www.museumofrussianicons.org/about-us.html |archivedate=2009-06-06 |df= }} Museum of Russian Icons: About Us.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collection ===

The Museum collection includes more than 1,000 Russian icons and related artifacts. The icons range in date from 1450 to the present day and are installed in thematic groupings rather than chronological order. The Museum is particularly proud to display extremely rare Royal Doors that once led to the High Altar of an Orthodox Church in Russia and can be traced back to the 17th century. The Royal Doors have recently been added to the Museum's collection and are considered to be the "finest pair in the United States."&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://museumofrussianicons.org/en/special-exhibits/on-view/royal-doors/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808045749/http://museumofrussianicons.org/en/special-exhibits/on-view/royal-doors/ |archivedate=2014-08-08 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhibitions ===

The Museum organizes its own exhibitions from the permanent collection and also hosts visiting exhibitions from other museums and collections. In 2008 and 2010, respectively the Museum co-organized exhibitions of icons from the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and the Andrei Rublev Museum of Early Russian Art and Culture. Because of an embargo of art loans from Russia to the U.S., ongoing since 2011, the Museum has relied on exhibitions originating in the United States. 

== Center for Icon Studies ==

The Museum houses the  [http://museumofrussianicons.org/research/index.php/publications/publication-guidelines/about-the-journal-of-icon-studies/] Center for Icon Studies, the research arm of the institution that publishes the online ''Journal of Icon Studies''. The journal is the only peer-reviewed publication exclusively devoted to Russian icons and related scholarship. Submissions to the journal are reviewed by members of the editorial board, which consists of eleven leading scholars in the field from the U.S., Europe, and Russia. The editorial board is composed of some of the leading researchers in the field of icon studies:
*Professor David Birnbaum, chairman of the Department of Slavic Languages and Literatures at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]
*Professor [[Robin Cormack]], professor emeritus of art history at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]]

'''''My Joy''''' ({{lang-ru|Счастье моё}}) is a 2010 internationally co-produced Russian-language  [[road movie|road]] film directed by [[Sergei Loznitsa]]. It is set in the western regions of Russia, somewhere near [[Smolensk]]. ''My Joy'' was the first Ukrainian film ever to compete for the [[Palme d'Or]].

==Plot==
It is summer, and young driver Georgy takes his light truck on a trip to another town with a cargo of flour. He is stopped at a road police post by a pair of rude and corrupt policemen. While they are flirting with the woman they stopped earlier, Georgy manages to grab his papers and leave unnoticed. There he picks up a hitchhiker, an old man who recounts him a disturbing story: soon after [[World War II]], while returning home from the front, a corrupt military officer brazenly robbed him by threatening him with arrest if he did not comply. He later shot the officer in retaliation. Later when Georgy parks his truck and steps out and shortly returns, the old man has disappeared.

Later Georgy meets an underage prostitute. He takes pity on the girl and gives her some money and food, but she is offended by his charity, insults him and leaves.

Later still, Georgy is lost in the night and decides to camp in the field until dawn. Three locals approach and try to steal from the truck, only to be stopped by Georgy. They distract his attention with some neutral conversation, telling him how one of their friends is a [[Elective mutism|mute]] because someone killed his father in front of him when he was a child. Suddenly one hits Georgy on the head with a log and he loses consciousness.

The scene shifts to the times of World War II. Early in the war, two Soviet soldiers from a defeated unit cautiously feel their way through the occupied land in the deep German rear. They enter a lone house where a widowed teacher lives with his infant son. The teacher is kind to the soldiers and provides them with much-needed food and shelter. However, the soldiers regard his pacifism and indifference towards the German invaders as treasonous, so they kill him, rob the house, and continue on their way, leaving the child to his own devices.

The scene shifts back to the present. Some time has passed. It is winter, and Georgy lives in the same house that once was the teacher's. The blow has left him feeble-minded and mute. He walks around bearded, dilapidated, with a blank stare. The woman living in the house keeps him as a sex slave while she trades his flour on the local market. A policeman approaches and tells her that Georgy and his truck are being searched for, so she had better get rid of both. Georgy is beaten by the locals and detained by the police, only to be released the next night when another inmate challenges the lone guard to a fight, beats him unconscious, and unlocks the cells.

The woman sells Georgy's truck and leaves the place, abandoning him in the snowcapped village. Homeless, he wanders about being driven off by the locals, until he collapses from exhaustion. He is found and picked up by the old man whom he earlier gave a ride.

A military van comes to the village, carrying two servicemen tasked with delivering the body of a deceased soldier to his native place. Their daunting task is not made easier by the fact that one of them, an officer, suffers from [[delirium tremens]]. Unable to locate the relatives of the dead soldier, they decide to bribe some random people into signing the papers and leave the body to them. They approach the old man, who at first is suspicious but eventually agrees. However, shortly afterwards Georgy walks out of the house to find the old man dead. It is hinted that he may have been axed by the officer, who in his alcoholic delusion mistook him for someone else.

Georgy numbly grabs the old man's pistol and walks out to the road, where he is picked up by a very talkative truck driver, who rambles about the importance of not meddling in other people's affairs. Meanwhile, on the road the same two police officers from the beginning of the movie stop a police major and his wife. When they begin to write him up for a burnt-out headlight, the major attempts to bribe and intimidate them. When this fails and he turns to leave, a fistfight ensues, with the major handcuffed and brutally beaten. To produce two fake witnesses of his arrest, they stop another car, which is the truck with Georgy. They easily threaten the driver into signing the papers, but when they turn to Georgy, he stands silently. A fight breaks out, and one of the policemen pulls out an assault rifle. Georgy instantly shoots him dead, then everyone else. Still clutching the pistol, he staggers out into the dark.

==Production==
The film was a co-production between Germany's Ma.ja.de, Ukraine's Sota Cinema Group and the Netherlands' Lemming Film.&lt;ref name=cannes /&gt; The film was shot in Ukraine as a condition for receiving money from the Ukrainian Ministry of Culture, but most of the 1.5 million [[Euro]] budget came from Germany. According to the director there are about 140 cuts in the whole film. Vlad Ivanov's Russian was dubbed as he is a Romanian actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Galetski |first=Kirill |date=17 May 2010 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film-festival/cannes/news/e3i7278144fcfbad6f7550bbcdea938181e |title=Q&amp;A: Sergei Loznitsa |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |accessdate=17 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521093037/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film-festival/cannes/news/e3i7278144fcfbad6f7550bbcdea938181e |archivedate=21 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reviews ==
There was a considerable outcry in Russian media over the film's purported [[Russophobic]] slant.

[[Image:NAEA logo sq.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Logo]] of the National Art Education Association.]]
The '''National Art Education Association''' (NAEA) is a [[professional association]] founded in 1947 in the United States. It is the world's largest professional [[art education]] association.

The NAEA's annual convention attracts thousands of art educators and offers art educators a chance to network, establish mentor relationships, and attend professional development events.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/index.asp?layout=talkbackCommentsFull&amp;talk_back_header_id=6649576&amp;articleid=CA6726768 Melissa Techman, "Art Teachers Bring 21st-Century Vision to 2010 Conference", ''School Library Journal'', Apr. 20, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  The NAEA also gives awards for Art Educator of the Year at this convention.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/life/stories/2010/04/19/1a-showtell19-art-gj686cra-1.html?sid=101 "OSU educator honored", ''The Columbus Dispatch'', Apr. 19, 2010], [http://kohd.com/page/170770 "Oregon's Best Art Teacher Selected from Bend", KOHD.com, Apr. 20, 2010], [http://www.dentonrc.com/sharedcontent/dws/drc/entertainment/stories/DRC_artbriefs_0418.25ac6816d.html "UNT art professor wins national award", ''Denton Record-Chronicle'', Apr. 18, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the [[Art &amp; Creative Materials Institute]], in 1969, the NAEA began sponsoring March as [[Youth Art Month]].  Since 1984, Youth Art Month has been run by the [[Council for Art Education, Inc.]], which consists of representatives of the NAEA and other art associations.

As an advocacy organization, the NAEA speaks out in favor of increased funding for art education, and opposing cuts to art funding.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://peoplesworld.org/emergency-funding-urged-to-prevent-worst-school-cuts-in-50-years/ Susan Webb, "Emergency funding urged to prevent worst school cuts in 50 years", ''People's World'', Apr. 21, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The NAEA publishes two journals, ''Art Education'' and ''Studies in Art Education''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/publisher/naea Publisher Information from Jstor]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|RKD|the airport with [[IATA code]] RKD|Knox County Regional Airport}}

[[File:KoninklijkeBibliotheek2.jpg|thumb|As the logos on the window show, the RKD shares the same building (located near [[Den Haag Centraal]]) with the {{Interlanguage link multi|Nederlands Letterkundig Museum|nl}} (LM), the [[Huygens Institute for Dutch History|Huygens ING]], the [[Netherlands Music Institute]] (NMI) and the [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]].]]

The '''Netherlands Institute for Art History''' or '''RKD''' (Dutch: '''RKD-Nederlands Instituut voor Kunstgeschiedenis''') is located in [[The Hague]] and is home to the largest [[art history]] center in the world. The center specializes in documentation, archives, and books on [[Western art]] from the late Middle Ages until modern times. All of this is open to the public, and much of it has been digitized and is available on their website. The main goal of the bureau is to collect, categorize, and make art research available, most notably in the field of [[Dutch Masters]].

Via the available databases, the visitor can gain insight into archival evidence on the lives of many artists of past centuries. The library owns approximately 450,000 titles, of which ca. 150,000 are auction catalogs. There are ca. 3,000 magazines, of which 600 are currently running subscriptions. Though most of the text is in Dutch, the standard record format includes a link to library entries and images of known works, which include English as well as Dutch titles.

The RKD also manages the Dutch version of the [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]], a [[thesaurus]] of terms for management of information on art and architecture. The original version is an initiative of the [[Getty Research Institute]] in [[Los Angeles, California]].

==History==
The collection was started through bequests by [[Frits Lugt]], art historian and owner of a massive collection of drawings and prints, and [[Cornelis Hofstede de Groot]] (1863–1930), a collector, art historian and museum curator. Their bequest formed the basis for both the art collection and the library, which is now mostly housed in the [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]] (National Library).
==Open access website==
Though not all of the library's holdings have been digitised, much of its [[metadata]] is accessible online. The website itself is available in both a Dutch and an English user interface.
===Online artist pages===
In the artist database ''RKDartists'', each artist is assigned a record number. To reference an artist page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/ followed by the artist's record number. For example, the artist record number for [[Salvador Dalí]] is 19752, so his RKD artist page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/19752 |title=Salvador Dalí |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property|P650}}
===Online artworks pages===
In the images database ''RKDimages'', each artwork is assigned a record number. To reference an artwork page directly, use the code listed at the bottom of the record, usually of the form: https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/ followed by the artwork's record number. For example, the artwork record number for [[The Night Watch]] is 3063, so its RKD artwork page can be referenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images/3063 |title=Civic guardsmen of Amsterdam under command of Banninck Cocq |publisher=Netherlands Institute for Art History |date= |accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Wikidata property |P350 }}
{{commons category|RKDimages}}

===Online thesaurus of art terms===
The Art and Architecture Thesaurus also assigns a record for each term, but these can not be referenced online by record number. Rather, they are used in the databases and the databases can be searched for terms. For example, the painting called "The Night Watch" is a militia painting, and all records fitting this keyword (Dutch: ''algemene trefwoord'') can be seen by selecting this from the image screen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5BRKD_algemene_trefwoorden%5D=militia%20painting All available records for "militia painting"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

The thesaurus is a set of general terms, but the RKD also contains a database for an alternate form of describing artworks, that today is mostly filled with biblical references. This is the [[iconclass]] database. To see all images that depict Miriam's dance, the associated iconclass code 71E1232 can be used as a special search term.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/images#filters%5Biconclass_code%5D=71E1232  All available records for iconclass code "71E1232"] in RKDimages&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society''', also known as '''PPTS''', was a [[text publication society]], which specialised in publishing editions and translations of medieval texts relevant to the history of pilgrimage to the [[Holy Land]]. The society was established in London to provide translations of accounts by pilgrims and other travelers between the 4th and 15th centuries. Particular attention was given to accounts containing geographical or topographical information, as well as those which discussed the manners and customs of the Holy Land. The original narratives were written in a variety of languages, including Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, Old French, Russian, and German.

The Society first started publishing its work in 1884, and continued for eleven years, publishing a total of twelve volumes. In 1896, these works were transferred to the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]], for distribution to the members of the PPTS.&lt;ref&gt;''The New International Encyclopedia'', edited by Daniel Coit Gilman, Harry Thurston Peck, Frank Moore Colby, 1903&lt;/ref&gt;

The editions remain valuable and are frequently cited in scholarly works. A version is also available as ''The library of the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Library of the Palestine Pilgrims' Text Society|isbn= 978-0-404-04890-7|year=1971|publisher=AMS Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain well-known pilgrimages included are those of:

* [[Itinerarium Burdigalense|Unknown Pilgrim of Bordeaux]]
* [[Saint Jerome]]'s ''Pilgrimage of the Holy Paula''
* [[Mukaddasi]]'s description of Syria
* [[Jacques de Vitry]]
* Bohaedden's ''Life of [[Saladin]]''
* John Poloner's description of the Holy Land

In fiction, a '''plot hole''', '''plothole''' or '''plot error''' is a gap or inconsistency in a storyline that goes against the flow of logic established by the story's plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/plot_hole|title=plot hole {{!}} Definition of plot hole in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such inconsistencies include such things as illogical or impossible events,&lt;ref&gt;https://screenrant.com/movies-plot-holes-wrong/&lt;/ref&gt; and statements or events that contradict earlier events in the storyline. The term is more loosely also applied to "loose ends" in a plot – side-lined story elements that remain unresolved by the end of the plot.

[[Image:Hurt Report cover page.png|220px|thumb|Example of a front page of a report]]
A '''report''' or '''account''' is an [[Information technology|informational]] work, such as writing, speech, television or film, made with the intention of relaying information or recounting events in a presentable form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/report|title=Report - definition of report by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report is made with the specific intention of relaying information or recounting certain events in a way that is concise, factual and relevant to the audience at hand. Reports may be conveyed through a written medium, speech, television, or film. In professional spheres, reports are a common and  vital communication tool. Additionally, reports may be official or unofficial, and can be listed publicly or only available privately depending on the specific scenario. The audience for a report can vary dramatically, from an elementary school classroom to a boardroom on [[Wall Street]].

== Usage ==
Reports fill a vast array of informational needs for a spectrum of audiences. They may be used to keep track of information, evaluate a strategy, or make decisions. Written reports are documents which present focused and salient content, generally to a specific audience. A type of an official report would be a police report, which could have legally binding consequences. Other types of reports, such as ''[[Consumer Reports]]'', inform the public about the quality of products available on the market. Reports are used in government, business, education, science, and other fields, often to display the results of an experiment, investigation or inquiry.

== Attributes ==
One of the most common formats for presenting reports is [[IMRAD]]—introduction, methods, results, and discussion. This structure, standard for the genre, mirrors traditional publication of scientific research and summons the ethos and credibility of that discipline. Reports are not required to follow this pattern and may use alternative methods such as the problem-solution format, wherein the author first lists an issue and then details what must be done to fix the problem. Transparency and a focus on quality are keys to writing a useful report. Accuracy is also important. Faulty numbers in a financial report could lead to disastrous consequences.

== Standard Elements ==
Reports use features such as tables, graphics, images, voice, or specialized vocabulary in order to persuade a specific audience to undertake an action or inform the reader of the subject at hand. Some common elements of written reports include headings to indicate topics and help the reader locate relevant information quickly, and visual elements such as charts, tables and figures, which are useful for breaking up large sections of text and making complex issues more accessible. Lengthy written reports will almost always contain a table of contents, appendices, footnotes, and references. A bibliography or list of references will appear at the end of any credible report and citations are often included within the text itself. Complex terms are explained within the body of the report or listed as footnotes in order to make the report easier to follow. A short summary of the report's contents, called an [[Abstract (summary)|abstract]], may appear in the beginning so that the audience knows what the report will cover. Online reports often contain hyperlinks to internal or external sources as well.

Verbal reports differ from written reports in the minutiae of their format, but they still educate or advocate for a course of action. Quality reports will be well researched and the speaker will list their sources if at all possible.

== Types ==
Some examples of reports are:

[[File:'Ordination' by Nicolas Poussin, 1630s.jpg|thumb|''[[Ordination]]'' from the first series]]

'''''The Seven Sacraments''''' refers to two series of paintings of the [[seven sacraments]] by the French painter [[Nicholas Poussin]].

==First series==
{{Commons category|Seven Sacraments by Nicolas Poussin (first series)}}
[[File:Seven Sacraments - Ordination II (1647) Nicolas Poussin.jpg|thumb|''[[Ordination]]'' from the second series]]

Painted between 1637 and 1640, the first series was commissioned by [[Cassiano del Pozzo]] in the second half of the 1630s and was sold to the [[Dukes of Rutland]] in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.christies.com/about/press-center/releases/pressrelease.aspx?pressreleaseid=4238&lt;/ref&gt; One of the seven, ''Penance'', was destroyed in a fire at the Rutlands' [[Belvoir Castle]] in 1816, and ''Baptism'' was acquired by the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington DC in 1939, where it still resides. The remaining five were still at Belvoir Castle at the time when Anthony Blunt wrote his catalogue in 1966 and then were on show at the [[National Gallery]] in London until recently. All five of these paintings in the National Gallery were taken off show in November 2010 prior to the attempted sale of ''Ordination'' on 8 December that year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-11946061&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Ordination'' was ultimately purchased by the [[Kimbell Art Museum]] for US$24.3 million and was displayed for the first time there on September 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kimbellart.org/News/News-Article.aspx?nid=142 Poussin masterpiece from the celebrated 'Sacraments' series acquired by the Kimbell Art Museum]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fitzwilliam Museum]] in Cambridge in 2013 bought ''Extreme Unction'' from the Duke of Rutland, who retains ownership of the remaining three works in the series.

The images listed below are the remaining six paintings of the first series:

==Second series==
{{Commons category|Seven Sacraments by Nicolas Poussin (second series)}}
The second series was painted for [[Paul Fréart de Chantelou]] from 1644 to 1648 and was acquired by [[Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater]] in 1798. The paintings passed by descent to the Earls of Ellesmere, the last of whom became the [[Duke of Sutherland]] in 1964. All of the second series, which was commissioned by Chantelou, is currently [[Sutherland Loan|on loan]] at the [[National Gallery of Scotland]], Edinburgh as part of the [[Bridgewater Loan]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Blunt|Blunt, Anthony]] (1966).

'''Situationist prank''' is a term used in the [[mass media]] to label a distinctive tactic by the [[Situationist International]], consisting of setting up a subversive&lt;ref name="KnabbSanguinetti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt; political prank, hoax or stunt;&lt;ref name="Marrone05"/&gt; In the terminology of the Situationist International, stunts and media pranks are very similar to ''situations''.&lt;ref&gt;Sandlin, Jennifer A. (2009) [https://books.google.com/books?id=32vZVme29CcC&amp;pg=PA240 ''Critical pedagogies of consumption''] p.240 quote: {{quotation|Through artistic interventions, hoaxes, tactical media pranks, or what  the SI called "situations," culture jammers direct public attention ...}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franks, Benjamin (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=HqvaAAAAMAAJ ''Rebel alliances: the means and ends of contemporary British anarchisms''] p.315 {{quotation|Stunts are very similar to situations but have an additional characteristic, namely that the imaginative interaction is aimed at the mainstream media, the intention being that they broadcast the prank to a wider public}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[détournement]]'' technique, that is "turning expressions of the capitalist system against itself,"&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt; was the essential element of a situationist prank.&lt;ref name="Marrone05"/&gt; The Situationist tactic of using ''détournement'' for subversive pranks is such a distinctive and influential aspect of the Situationist International, that they are sometimes labeled as a group of political ''pranksters''.&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt;

This tactic was used by the [[Sex Pistols]] to mock [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]'s [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] celebrations.&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marrone05"/&gt;  It also inspired the [[culture jamming]] movement in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"/&gt; The expression '''situationist prankster''' has been later established as a typical label used on those who perform [[media prank]]s or [[publicity stunt]]s.&lt;ref name="Vincentelli04"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fortnight335-345"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsaesser"/&gt;

==By Situationists==

===Notre-Dame Affair on National TV===
{{main|Notre-Dame Affair}}
One of the earliest Situationist pranks,&lt;ref name="Holt2010p252"&gt;Holt (2010) p.252&lt;/ref&gt; '''The Notre-Dame Affair''' was an intervention performed by members of the radical wing of the [[Lettrist]] movement ([[Michel Mourre]], [[Serge Berna]], Ghislain Desnoyers de Marbaix and Jean Rullier), on Easter Sunday, April 9, 1950, at [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] in Paris, while the mass was aired live on National TV. Michel Mourre, dressed in the habit of a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[monk]] and backed by his co-conspirators, chose a quiet moment in the Easter High Mass to climb to the rostrum and declaim before the whole congregation a blasphemous anti-sermon on the death of God, penned by Serge Berna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ snarkout: to have done with the judgment of god&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031113002215/http://www.snarkout.org/archives/2002/11/24/ |date=2003-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirorenzaglia.com/index.php?itemid=8 miro renzaglia - COSTRUIRE L'UNITA' D'AREA/2&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirorenzaglia.com/index.php?itemid=311 miro renzaglia - SITUAZIONISMO&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strasbourg scandal===

{{main|On the Poverty of Student Life}}
Taking advantage of the apathy of their colleagues, five "Pro-situs", Situationist-influenced students had infiltrated the University of Strasbourg's [[Student activity center|student union]] in November 1966 and began scandalising the authorities.&lt;ref name=tmrg&gt;{{cite book | last = Plant | first = Sadie | title = The Most Radical Gesture | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1992 | isbn = 0-415-06222-5 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=vague&gt;{{cite book | last = Vague | first = Tom  | title = Anarchy in the Uk: the Angry Brigade | publisher = AK Press | location = Stirling | year = 1997 | isbn = 1-873176-98-8 |pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first action was to form an "anarchist appreciation society" called The Society for the Rehabilitation for Karl Marx and Ravachol; next they appropriated union funds to [[Flyposting|flypost]] "Return of the Durruti Column", [[Andre Bertrand]]'s ''[[detournement|détourned]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt; They then invited the Situationists to contribute a critique of the University of Strasbourg, and ''On the Poverty of Student Life'', written by Tunisian Situationist [[Mustapha/Omar Khayati]] was the result.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt;

The students promptly proceeded to print 10,000 copies of the pamphlet using university funds and distributed them during a ceremony marking the beginning of the [[academic year]]. This provoked an immediate outcry in the local, national and international media.&lt;ref name=vague/&gt;

===Sanguinetti's ''Report'' to save capitalism===
By 1972, [[Gianfranco Sanguinetti]] and [[Guy Debord]] were the only two remaining members of Situationist International. Working with Debord, in August 1975, Sanguinetti wrote a pamphlet titled ''Rapporto veridico sulle ultime opportunità di salvare il capitalismo in Italia'' ([[English language|Eng]]: ''Veritable Report on the Last Chances to Save Capitalism in Italy''), which (inspired by [[Bruno Bauer]]) purported to be the cynical writing of "Censor", a powerful [[industrialist]]. The pamphlet argues that the ruling class of Italy supported the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]] and other mass slaughter, for the higher goal of defending the capitalist status quo from communist claims. The pamphlet was mailed to 520 of Italy's most powerful individuals. It was received as genuine, and powerful politicians, industrialists and journalists praised its contents and guessed the identity of its high-profile author. After reprinting the tract into a small book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sanguineti|first= Gianfranco|last2=Censor (pseud.) |date= 1975 |title= Rapporto veridico sulle ultime opportunità di salvare il capitalismo in Italia|trans-title= ''Veritable Report on the Last Chances to Save Capitalism in Italy''|url= https://books.google.it/books/about/Rapporto_veridico_sulle_ultime_opportuni.html?id=84chYAAACAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y|language= italian|location= |publisher= [[Mursia]] |pages= 139|isbn= |access-date= 2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanguinetti revealed himself to be the true author. Under pressure from Italian authorities, Sanguinetti left Italy in February 1976, and was denied re-entry to France, from which he had previously been deported in 1971.&lt;ref name="KnabbSanguinetti"&gt;[[Ken Knabb]] [http://www.notbored.org/report.html ''Gianfranco Sanguinetti'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Sanguinetti |first= Gianfranco|others=Translated by Bill Brown|date= 2014 |title= Truthful Report on the Last Chances to Save Capitalism in Italy|url= https://books.google.it/books?id=YpdKBgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PR6&amp;ots=utUO7uVzwA&amp;dq=Gianfranco%20Sanguinetti%20Rapporto%20veridico%20sulle%20ultima%20opportunita%20di%20salvare%20il%20capitalismo%20in%20Italia&amp;hl=it&amp;pg=PR6#v=onepage&amp;q=Gianfranco%20Sanguinetti%20Rapporto%20veridico%20sulle%20ultima%20opportunita%20di%20salvare%20il%20capitalismo%20in%20Italia&amp;f=false|location= Brooklyn|publisher= Colossal Books|page= |isbn= 9780615948270|access-date= 2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Munzi|last2=Macciocchi|first1= Ulderico|first2=Maria Antonietta|date= 1994-03-12|title=Debord, la rivoluzione è finita|trans-title= ''Debord, the revolution is over''|url= http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1994/dicembre/03/Debord_rivoluzione_finita_co_0_9412039257.shtml|language= italian|newspaper= [[Corriere della Sera]]|location= Milan|access-date= 2015-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===
Film ''[[Hurlements en faveur de Sade]]'' (Howls for de Sade) (1952) by [[Guy Debord]], had 24 minutes of black screen. Book ''[[Mémoires]]'' (1959) by [[Guy Debord]] and [[Asger Jorn]] had the cover made of [[sandpaper]].

==Legacy==
The situationist tactic of a détournement-based hoax was notoriously used in February 1977 by the Sex Pistols, who played [[God Save the Queen (Sex Pistols song)|their version of "God Save the Queen"]] while sailing down the [[River Thames]] past the [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] to mock the [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver Jubilee]] river procession in honor of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name="Marrone05"&gt;Marrone, Gianfranco (2005) [https://books.google.com/books?id=0jluoyGktKsC ''Sensi alterati: droghe, musica, immagini''], p.45, quote: 
{{quotation|[...] gioco al complotto, alla manipolazione dei media, alla beffa, alla "grande truffa," o al ''detournement'' -- inventato dai situazionisti e ripreso dai punk -- che appunto del situazionismo sono talvolta concreti continuatori. Pensiamo in questo senso al fin troppo noto caso, esagerato dai media, ma paradigmatico, del manager dei Sex Pistols, Malcom McClaren, a partire dal quale, nell'estate del 1977, si scatenò, con grande scandalo, il lancio del gruppo dei Pistols in pieno Giubileo della regina, e l'interesse della stampa per la nascente scena punk. Tuttavia, anche in questo caso non si tratta, come invece e' stato spesso sostenuto, di freddo "gioco a tavolino", di cinismo, di furbo lancio di un prodotto da parte di chi aveva studiato i media e lavorava sulla guerriglia semiologica (cfr. Fabbri P. 2002, p.40), di una tattica che sarebbe poi stata facilmente sfruttata e fatta propria da quel momento in avanti dall'industria culturale ''mainstream''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expression '''situationist prankster''' has been later established as a typical label used on those who perform [[media prank]]s or [[publicity stunt]]s, as in the cases of ''[[The KLF]]'',&lt;ref name="Vincentelli04"&gt;Vincentelli, Elisabeth (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=yoCV0eaetb0C ''ABBA gold'']&lt;/ref&gt; the ''[[K Foundation]]'',&lt;ref name="Fortnight335-345"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=edhnAAAAMAAJ Fortnight, Issues 335-345] p.349&lt;/ref&gt; [[Genesis P-Orridge]],&lt;ref name="Buckley"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C The rough guide to rock edited by Peter Buckley]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harun Farocki]],&lt;ref name="Elsaesser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OHBrp2_W2ccC Harun Farocki: working on the sightlines By Thomas Elsaesser] p.106&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref name="Gimarc94p47"&gt;[[George Gimarc]] (1994) [http://www.gimarc.com/PUNK_DIARY.html ''Punk Diary 1970-1979''], p.47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sabin99p182"&gt;Sabin, Roger (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Pnb1g3oIzTIC ''Punk rock: so what? : the cultural legacy of punk''], p.182&lt;/ref&gt;

A growth of campaigns using tactics such as the [[Flash Mob]] or [[Subvertising]] in recent years can be traced to situationist pranks. These tactics, notable in stunts by [[The Yes Men]], campaigns by [[Green Peace]], and guerilla art by [[Banksy]], have been characterised by their appropriation of establishment symbols, shifting the intended purpose of public (now private) space, or creating bizarre reality hacks that merely remix the cultural context, as opposed to providing something entirely surreal.&lt;ref name="New Statesman"&gt;New Statesman (2013) [http://newstatesman.com/culture/2013/05/spectacle-disintegration ''The Spectacle of Disintegration'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some surreal pranks continue to exist in more subversive movements, such as the Alley concept,&lt;ref name="Alley concept"&gt;Alley Concept (2013) [http://alleyconcept.tumblr.com "Alley Concept"]&lt;/ref&gt; and are traceable to situationist pranks in their deliberate constructions of surreal situations that juxtapose the [[Spectacle (critical theory)|Spectacle]] thereby aiming to reawaken authentic desires and liberate everyday life.

The concept forms the primary genre on popular Australian television series "The Chaser's War on Everything." Worldwide media attention followed their successful entry into the G20 Summit held in Sydney, Australia - September 2007. The group formed a motorcade with a Bin Laden-esque character inside a limousine flying flags of a non-existent country.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvH3YQGQwLM The Chaser's war on Everything - APEC Motorcade]  Sep 12, 2007 - Chas dressed as Osama bin Laden the Chasers drive a disguised Canadian motorcade ...&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:NYC Grand Central Terminal ceiling.jpg|thumb|The [[constellation]] mural at [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]] is an example of skyscape art.]]
'''Skyscape art''' depicts representations of the [[sky]], especially in a [[painting]] or [[photograph]]. Skyscapes differ from [[cloudscape (art)|cloudscape]]s because they do not necessarily include [[cloud]]s. Like cloudscape art, skyscape art can also omit any view of land or anything else which might help to suggest scale or orientation. Images called "skyscapes" often do include clouds or land, but these things can also be excluded or kept to a minimum.

The view may be from earth or from a level far above. There is often nothing to suggest scale in the art, unless a bit of [[landscape]] is included or some phenomena such as the depiction of clouds, precipitation, [[rainbow]]s and [[aurorae]]. Some [[artist]]s also depict [[bird]]s, [[insect]]s and other flying objects, as well as manmade [[aircraft]], [[kite]]s and objects such as [[leaves]], and [[balloon]]s.

There are many examples of cloudless skies in painting, [[printmaking]], [[serigraphy]] and photography. 

[[Weather]] is often an important element in the composition of skyscapes.

The sky is really nothing more than the denser gaseous zone of the earth’s [[atmosphere]]. Sky can be depicted as many different [[color]]s, such as a pale [[blue]] or the lack of any color at all, such as the [[night]] sky, which has the appearance of blackness, albeit with a scattering of [[star]]s on a clear night. During the day, the sky is seen as a deep blue due to the [[sunlight]] reflected on the [[air]].

Astronomically speaking, the sky is a celestial sphere–an imaginary dome divided into constellations–where the [[moon]], [[planet]]s, stars and [[sun]] seem to visually move across the sky.

Although artists have long painted the sky it was [[Edward Hopper]] who first showed us the beauty of the skyscape, sans clouds.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In the 1950s, [[Eric Sloane]] painted many cloudless skyscapes during his stay in [[Taos, New Mexico]].

Another example of a cloudless skyscape artwork is the celestial ceiling [[mural]] at [[Grand Central Terminal]] in [[New York City]].

The '''Solovetsky Stone''' is a monument located in [[Lubyanka Square]] in [[Moscow]], across from [[Lubyanka (KGB)|KGB headquarters]]. The monument consists of a large stone brought from the [[Solovetsky Islands]], the location of [[Solovki prison camp]], part of the Soviet [[Gulag]] system. The monument was erected in 1990 to honor victims of political suppression in the Soviet Union.

==History==

[[File:RIAN archive 749019 Opening of monument to victims of political repressions.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gleb Yakunin]] performing a service for the victims of the Stalinist political repressions during the unveiling of the Solovetsky Stone in Lubyanka Square, Moscow, on October 30, 1990]]

According to the Russian [[NGO]] ''[[Memorial (society)|Memorial]]'', the monument was erected on 30 October 1990 to commemorate a 1974 initiative by political prisoners to establish a "Day of Political Prisoners in the [[USSR]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsru.com/russia/23feb2008/memorial.html news.ru article], 23 February 2008 (in Russian), [https://web.archive.org/web/20091121011648/http://www.robertamsterdam.com/2008/02/pardon_our_appearance_were_bui.htm English translation]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] officially established 30 October as the [[Day of Remembrance of the Victims of Political Repressions]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/30/world/europe/30iht-putin.4.8118386.html?_r=1 Putin visits memorial to victims of Stalinist Great Terror], ''The New York Times'', October 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Another Solovetsky Stone was erected in the public garden on Troitskaya Square in [[Saint Petersburg]] in 2002. It was designed by [[Yevgeny Ukhnalyov]] and is officially known as the ''Memorial to the Victim of Political Repressions in Petrograd - Leningrad''. The monument is a 10-tonne [[granite]] [[boulder]] taken 50 meters from the place of mass executions of the prisoners of the [[Solovki prison camp]]. The rock is set on a polished granite base with inscriptions "To prisoners of [[GULAG]]", "To victims of Communist Terror", "To Freedom Fighters" and a line from the "Requiem" poem of [[Anna Akhmatova]]: "I wish to call all of them by name, but ..." (Хотелось бы всех поименно назвать...) The monument was unveiled on 4 September 2002 in preparation for celebrations of 300 years of Saint Petersburg. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encspb.ru/en/article.php?kod=2804022240 Solovetsky Stone, monument], Saint Petersburg Encyclopedia. Accessed 17 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Solvki Encyclopedia'' Ukhnalyov and the architect of the memorial, [[State Duma]] deputy [[Yuly Rybakov]], paid all the expenses personally including the transportation of the 10,400&amp;nbsp;kg boulder from the [[Solovetsky Islands]] in the [[White Sea]]. The Saint Petersburg city administration would not help finance the memorial despite significant budget allocated to celebrate the tercentenary of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solovki.ca/people_18/e_uhnalev.php Он установил в Питере Соловецкий камень] Solovki Encyclopedia {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Stavanger Renaissance''' (''Stavangerrenessansen'') is the name for the cultural period which peaked in the middle of the 17th century in the vicinity of [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]]. It was characterized principally by church art, largely decorated altarpieces, pulpits, baptismal fonts and wall surfaces.

The Stavanger Renaissance is an important period for Norwegian church art and décor. Art work  from this period are found around the southwestern coast and throughout western Norway. Examples of churches representing by the art of the Stavanger Renaissance would include parish churches in  [[Oddernes Church|Oddernes]] (1620), [[Årdal Church (Rogaland)|Årdal]] (ca.1620),  [[Røldal Stave Church|Røldal]] (1627-1629),   [[Vestre Moland]] (1630) as well as  [[Utstein Abbey]] (1625-1650).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://snl.no/%C3%85rdal_kirke|title = Årdal kirke|publisher =   Store norske leksikon|author=   Nina Aldin Thune|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://snl.no/Utstein_Kloster|title = Utstein Kloster|publisher =   Store norske leksikon|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The [[Protestant Reformation]] from 1537 had not yet changed the art in the local churches.  Much of the old [[Roman Catholic]] art was still present in the churches. Church authorities wanted to change this, so they ordered new art and reconstruction of old churches. At the start of the 17th century, the time was right. The city of Stavanger became more and more popular for immigrants who worked as artists.

The first of these artists  was the German born painter [[Peter Reimers]] (active 1607-25) whose art work first appeared in  [[Kinsarvik]] during 1607. Reimers left more than 40 large and small church work dating from 1607 to 1626.   He performed a variety of decorative works and altarpieces as well as portraits.
He was followed by [[Gottfried Hendtzschel]], who was initially hired by the widow of Peter Reimers to complete her husband's assignments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://nbl.snl.no/Peter_Reimers|title = Peter Reimers|publisher =  Norsk biografisk leksikon|author=   Kåre Hosar|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://nkl.snl.no/Gottfried_Andersen_Hendtzschel|title = Gottfried Anderssøn Hendtzschel|publisher =  Norsk kunstnerleksikon|author=   Henning Alsvik|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;Other significant artists from the period include [[Andrew Lawrenceson Smith]] (''Anders Smith'') and  craftsmen   Thomas  and  Laurits Snekker. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=   https://nbl.snl.no/Anders_Smith|title =    Anders Smith |publisher =    Norsk biografisk leksikon|author= Kjartan Fløgstad|accessdate= December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://nkl.snl.no/Gottfried_Andersen_Hendtzschel|title = Laurits Snekker|publisher =    Norsk kunstnerleksikon|author= Sigrid Christie|accessdate= December 1,  2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1281">'''Strié''' is a popular form of [[faux painting]] using [[glaze (painting technique)|glaze]] and paint brushes to create a soft natural striped texture.  [[File:sch ewf 10.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Example of the strie faux painting technique over raised stencil]]

Strié is a negative glaze technique. The glaze is generally rolled over the entire surface, and then removed with a tool such as a brush.&lt;ref&gt;Phil Schmidt, ''Building &amp; Finishing Walls &amp; Ceilings'', Creative Publishing International, 2002, p86. {{ISBN|1-58923-042-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''strié'' can be used to describe this process of painting, or to describe the actual finish created.

Strié is a simple technique that can be altered and elaborated in many ways.  It can be done on its own, with the streaks directed either vertically or horizontally.  It can be brushed over a raised [[plaster]] stencil.  It is also very popular to overlap a horizontal and vertical strié, creating the look of fabrics such as linen or denim.  This is often referred to as a linen weave or burlap strié.

'''''The Cave of the Storm Nymphs''''' is a painting by British artist [[Edward Poynter]], depicting three nude [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]] or [[nymphs]] from [[Greek mythology]] that lure sailors to their deaths. Poynter painted two versions, one in 1902 and the other in 1903, with minor differences. The former is housed in the [[Norfolk]]'s Hermitage Museum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/norfolks-hermitage-museum-home-to-an-impressive-art-collection/2014/01/09/17a35a7a-74a3-11e3-8def-a33011492df2_story.html |title=Norfolk’s Hermitage Museum, home to an impressive art collection|work=[[The Washington Post]]|author=James F.

In 1901, Poynter drew a preparatory study for the painting, housed in the [[National Gallery of Canada]].&lt;ref name="gallery"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=189485|title=Study of a Nymph for "The Cave of the Storm Nymphs", 1901|publisher=[[National Gallery of Canada]]| accessdate =13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study was donated to the National Gallery of Canada by Dennis T.

'''The Gersh Agency''' (also known as '''TGA''', or simply '''Gersh''') is a talent and literary agency established in 1949 by Phil Gersh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/thr-guide-7-major-hollywood-799743|title=The THR Guide to the 7 Major Hollywood Agencies|website=hollywoodreporter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Beverly Hills, California]] and [[New York City]]. The Gersh Agency is the sixth largest talent agency in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://actingplan.com/top-talent-agencies-los-angeles/ Top Talent Agencies in Los Angeles (2017)] 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gersh was founded in Beverly Hills in 1949 by [[Phil Gersh]]. He was considered one of the last links between Hollywood's Golden Age and today's corporate-owned movie business,&lt;ref name="mclellan"/&gt; and his clients included [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[David Niven]], [[William Holden]], [[June Allyson]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Fredric March]], [[Gloria Grahame]], [[James Mason]], [[Karl Malden]], and [[Robert Wise]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/us/phil-gersh-a-leading-agent-in-hollywood-is-dead-at-92.html|title=Phil Gersh, a Leading Agent In Hollywood, Is Dead at 92|first=Bernard|last=Weinraub|date=May 12, 2004|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, [[Richard Arlook]] joined the agency, which subsequently grew from a handful of agents to over 60 agents.  Arlook left the agency in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.charitybuzz.com/catalog_items/meet-with-producer-manager-richard-arlook-in-beverly-1423600&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref name="mclellan"/&gt; 
Phil Gersh gradually handed over responsibility to his two sons but continued to play a role in the company's management until 10 weeks before his death in 2004.&lt;ref name="mclellan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/11/local/me-gersh11|title=Phil Gersh, 92; Agent With Old Hollywood Instincts, Art Patron|first=Dennis|last=McLellan|date=11 May 2004|work=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency is currently run by Phil Gersh's sons, Bob and David. They have since represented clients including [[Melanie Lynskey]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.backstage.com/magazine/article/away-goes-61631/ Backstage: "Away She Goes" by Jenelle Riley] September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Tom McCarthy]], [[Jeffrey Tambor]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadline.com/2016/03/bill-gersh-agent-the-gersh-agency-third-generation-1201719953/ Deadline: "Bill Gersh Becomes Agent, Marking Another In Third Generation In Talent Rep Business" by Anita Busch] March 14, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Driver]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadline.com/2017/10/adam-driver-spike-lee-black-klansman-1202194537/ Deadline: "Adam Driver Joins Spike Lee’s ‘Black Klansman’" by Anthony D'Alessandro] October 25, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pamela Gray]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadline.com/2017/06/pamela-gray-signs-gersh-agency-megan-leavey-co-writer-1202116005/ Deadline: "‘Megan Leavey’ Co-Writer Pamela Gray Signs With Gersh" by Anita Busch] June 19, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Gibson]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/criminal-minds-actor-thomas-gibson-suffers-defeat-fight-managers-commissions-988483 Hollywood Reporter: "'Criminal Minds' Actor Thomas Gibson Suffers Defeat in Fight Over Ex-Manager's Commissions" by Eriq Gardner] March 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drew Lynch]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tubefilter.com/2017/08/24/youtube-millionaires-drew-lynch/ TubeFilter: "YouTube Millionaires: Drew Lynch Uses His Dog Vlog To “Make Fun Of Myself And Our Experiences” By Sam Gutelle] August 24, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Terry Gilliam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/855061-terry-gilliams-the-man-who-killed-don-quixote-filming-wraps ComingSoon.net: "Terry Gilliam’s The Man Who Killed Don Quixote Filming Wraps"] June 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wynona Ryder]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/film/news/keanu-reeves-winona-ryder-reunite-destination-wedding-1202542984/ Variety Magazine: "Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder Reunite for ‘Destination Wedding’" By Robert Mitchell] August 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pat Healy (actor)|Pat Healy]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/film/news/amy-madigan-ken-marino-sky-ferreira-scott-free-pic-burning-woman-exclusive-1202401324/ Variety Magazine: "Amy Madigan, Ken Marino and Sky Ferreira Join Scott Free’s ‘Burning Woman’" By Justin Kroll] April 27, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sasheer Zamata]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/whoopi-goldberg-hill-harper-join-ghetto-plainsman-1025777 Hollywood Reporter:  "Whoopi Goldberg, Hill Harper Join 'Ghetto Plainsman'" by rebecca Ford] August 1, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joel David Moore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadline.com/2016/06/joel-david-moore-avatar-youth-in-oregon-gersh-1201781489/ Deadline: "Gersh Signs ‘Avatar’ Actor &amp; ‘Youth In Oregon’ Director Joel David Moore" by Ross A.

'''''The Happy Hooker: My Own Story''''' is a best-selling [[memoir]] by [[Xaviera Hollander]], a [[call girl]], published in 1971. It sold over 20 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philly.com/inquirer/magazine/20080626_Philmadelphia.html The Philadelphia Inquirer] on ''The Happy Hooker'': "He said he found it fascinating that her book, which has sold 20 million copies to date, is still being picked up today." (26 June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; copies.
[[Robin Moore]], who took Hollander's dictations of the book's contents, came up with the title, while Yvonne Dunleavy either transcribed the book&lt;ref name=Hollander1971&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Happy Hooker: My Own Story |publisher=Sphere Books |year=1971 |isbn=0-06-001416-4 |last=Hollander |first=Xaviera }}&lt;/ref&gt; or ghostwrote it.&lt;ref&gt;John Cassidy, "The hell-raiser", ''Sydney Morning Herald'', 9 December 2000, Good Weekend, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adaptations ==
Hollander's book inspired a series of movies, starting with 1975's ''[[The Happy Hooker (film)|The Happy Hooker]],'' which starred [[Lynn Redgrave]].&lt;ref name=IMDbHH1975&gt;{{cite web|title=The Happy Hooker (1975)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073091/|via=IMDb|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was followed by two sequels: 1977's ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]''&lt;ref name=IMDbHH1977&gt;{{cite web|title=The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington (1977)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076125/|via=IMDb|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1980's ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood]].''&lt;ref name=IMDbHH1980&gt;{{cite web|title=The Happy Hooker Goes Hollywood (1980)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080839/|via=IMDb|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the sequels the role of Hollander was played by [[Joey Heatherton]] and [[Martine Beswick]] respectively.

'''''The Jack Benny Program''''', starring [[Jack Benny]], is a radio-TV comedy series that ran for more than three decades and is generally regarded as a high-water mark in 20th-century American comedy.&lt;ref name=dun&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=EwtRbXNca0oC&amp;pg=PA357 Dunning, John. ''On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. Oxford University Press, 1998.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
[[Image:Jack Benny group photo.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Group photograph of Eddie Anderson, Dennis Day, Phil Harris, Mary Livingstone, Jack Benny, Don Wilson, and Mel Blanc]]
*[[Jack Benny]]&amp;nbsp;– played himself. Protagonist of the show, Benny is a comic, vain, penny-pinching miser, insisting on remaining 39 years old on stage despite his actual age, and often playing the violin badly.
*[[Eddie Anderson (comedian)|Eddie Anderson]]&amp;nbsp;– Rochester Van Jones, Jack's valet and chauffeur. Early in the show's run, he often talked of gambling or going out with women. Later on, he generally complained about his salary.
*[[Don Wilson (announcer)|Don Wilson]]&amp;nbsp;– Himself. Don generally opened the show and also did the commercials. He was the target of Jack's jokes, mostly about his weight.
*Gene McNulty&amp;nbsp;– [[Dennis Day]], a vocalist who was always in his early 20s no matter how old he actually was (by the time of the last television series, McNulty was 49 years old). He was sweet but not very bright. When called upon, he could use a wide variety of accents, which was especially useful in plays. He usually sang a song about 10 minutes into the program. If the episode was a flashback to a previous time, a ruse would be used such as Dennis singing his song for Jack so he could hear it before the show. McNulty adopted the name "Dennis Day" as his stage name for the rest of his career.
*Sadie Marks&amp;nbsp;– [[Mary Livingstone]], a sarcastic comic foil whose varying roles all served as, to use the description of [[Fred Allen]], "a girl to insult (Jack)." Marks, who in real life was Benny's wife, later legally changed her name to "Mary Livingstone" in response to the character's popularity. Her role on the program was reduced in the 1950s due to increasing stage fright, and Livingstone finally retired from acting in 1958&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.
*[[Phil Harris]]&amp;nbsp;– Himself.  A skirt-chasing, arrogant, hip-talking bandleader who constantly put Jack down (in a mostly friendly way, of course). He referred to Mary as "Livvy" or "Liv", and Jack as "Jackson".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/13/obituaries/phil-harris-91-radio-sidekick-to-jack-benny.html|title=Phil Harris, 91, Radio Sidekick to Jack Benny|last=Thomas Jr.|first=Robert MCG.|date=1995|work=New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Harris explained this once by saying it's "as close as I can get to jackass and still be polite"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Jack's Screen Guild Theater Performance|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4OdT94fZiM&amp;t=927s|series=The Jack Benny Program|network=NBC|date=|season=|airdate=15 January 1939|episode=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spun off into ''The Phil Harris–Alice Faye Show'' (1946–1954) with his wife, actress [[Alice Faye]]&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;. Harris left the radio show in 1952 and his character did not make the transition to television.
*[[Mel Blanc]]&amp;nbsp;– Carmichael the Polar Bear, Professor Pierre LeBlanc, Sy the Mexican, Polly (Jack's parrot), The Maxwell and many other assorted voices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tv.avclub.com/mel-blanc-stole-the-show-from-jack-benny-at-christmas-1798275294|title=Mel Blanc stole the show from Jack Benny at Christmas|last=Ihnat|first=Gwen|date=23 December 2014|work=AV/TV Club|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  An occasional running gag went along the lines of how the various characters Mel portrayed all looked alike.  He was also the sound effects of Jack's barely functional [[Maxwell automobile]]—a role he played again in the Warner Brothers cartoon ''[[The Mouse that Jack Built]]''. Another participating voice actor was [[Bert Gordon (comedian)|Bert Gordon]].  Mel also played a train station announcer, whose catchphrase was, "Train leaving on Track Five for Anaheim, Azusa and Cuc-amonga."&lt;ref&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azusa_Civic_Center#Celebration_of_a_running_gag:_%22Anaheim,_Azusa_and_Cucamonga%22&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Frank Nelson (actor)|Frank Nelson]]&amp;nbsp;– The "Yeeee-essss?" man. He was always the person who waited on Jack wherever he was, from the railroad station agent, to the store clerk, to the doorman, to the waiter. Frank always delighted in aggravating Jack, as he was apparently constantly aggravated by Jack's presence.
*[[Sheldon Leonard]]&amp;nbsp;– A racetrack [[tout]] (originated by [[Benny Rubin]]) who frequently offered unsolicited advice to Benny on a variety of non-racing-related subjects. Ironically, he never gave out information on horse racing, unless Jack demanded it. One excuse the tout gave was "Who knows about horses?"  His [[catchphrase]] was "Hey, bud... c'mere a minute"&lt;ref name="dun" /&gt;.
*[[Joseph Kearns]]&amp;nbsp;– Ed, the superannuated security guard in Jack's money vault. Ed had allegedly been guarding Jack's vault since (variously) the founding of Los Angeles (1781), the [[American Civil War]], the [[American Revolutionary War]], or when Jack had just turned 38 years old. [[Burt Mustin]] took over the role on television following Kearns' death in 1962. (In the 1959 cartoon ''[[The Mouse that Jack Built]]'', Mel Blanc played the part of Ed, who asks if the U.S. had won the war, then asks what would be done with the [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]]).  Kearns also played other roles, that of Dennis Day's father, that of a beleaguered IRS agent, and often of a clerk when it wasn't necessary to have Frank Nelson antagonize Jack. 
*[[Artie Auerbach]]&amp;nbsp;– Mr. Kitzel [who originally appeared on [[Al Pearce]]'s radio show in the late 1930s, where his famous catch phrase was, "Hmmmm... eh, could be!", and several years later as a regular on ''The [[Abbott &amp; Costello]] Show'', who originally started out as a Yiddish hot dog vendor selling hot dogs during the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]].  In later episodes, he would go on to lose his hot dog stand, and move on to various other jobs. A big part of his schtick involved garbling names with his accent, such as referring to [[Nat King Cole]] as "Nat King Cohen", or mentioning his favorite baseball player, "[[Rabbit Maranville|Rabbi Maranville]]". He often complained about his wife, an [[unseen character]] who was described as a large, domineering woman who, on one occasion, Kitzel visualized as "...from the front, she looks like Don Wilson from the side!" He often sang various permutations of his jingle, "Pickle in the middle and the mustard on top!"  Kitzel was often heard to say, "Hoo-hoo-HOO!" in response to questions asked of him.
*[[Bob Crosby]]&amp;nbsp;– In 1952, Crosby replaced Phil Harris as the bandleader, remaining until Benny retired the radio show in 1955. In joining the show, he became the leader of the same group of musicians who had played under Harris. Many of his running jokes focused on his apparent inability to pronounce "[[Manischewitz]]"&lt;ref&gt;In this episode Crosby is unable to pronounce Manischewitz, hence starting a running joke: {{cite episode|title=Happy Time|url=http://otrrlibrary.org/OTRRLib/Library%20Files/J%20Series/Jack%20Benny/Jack%20Benny%20Program%2052-12-07%20(824)%20Happy%20Time.mp3|series=The Jack Benny Program|network=CBS|date=|season=|airdate=7 December 1952|episode=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, his own family, and the wealth and lifestyle of his older brother, [[Bing Crosby]].
*[[Benny Rubin]]&amp;nbsp;– Played a variety of characters on both the radio and television versions. His most memorable bit was as an information desk attendant.  Jack would ask a series of questions that Rubin would answer with an ever-increasing irritated, "I don't know!" followed by the punchline {among them: "Well, if you ''don't'' know, why are you standing behind that counter?"/"I gotta stand behind something; somebody stole my pants; I missed a payment and they nailed my shoes to the floor!"}.
*Dale White&amp;nbsp;– Harlow Wilson, the son of Don and Lois Wilson, on TV.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1862073/ Dale White]&lt;/ref&gt;  His catchphrase, "You never did like me!", is usually uttered when he and Jack end up embroiled in an argument, though he once said it to his own mother.
*[[Verna Felton]]&amp;nbsp;– "Mrs. Day", Dennis' frighteningly domineering mother.  She often came to near blows with Jack in her efforts to prevent him from taking advantage of Dennis, and she was often portrayed as working various masculine jobs like a plumber, trucker or karate instructor.  Although she cares deeply for her son, Dennis' zany behavior aggravates her to no end, and the show has alluded to her hilariously myriad attempts at [[Filicide|killing]] and [[child abandonment|abandoning]] him.
*[[Bea Benaderet]] and [[Sara Berner]]&amp;nbsp;– "Gertrude Gearshift" and "Mabel Flapsaddle", a pair of [[telephone switchboard]] operators who always traded barbs with Jack (and sometimes each other) when he tried to put through a call.  Whenever the scene shifted to them, they would subtly plug a current picture in an insult such as "Mr. Benny's line is flashing!" "Oh, I wonder what [[Dial M For Murder|Dial M for Money]] wants now?" or "I wonder what [[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Schmoe Vadis]] wants now?"
*[[Jane Morgan (actress)|Jane Morgan]] and Gloria Gordon&amp;nbsp;– Martha and Emily, a pair of elderly ladies who were irresistibly attracted to Jack.
*[[James Stewart]] and his wife, Gloria&amp;nbsp;– Themselves. Recurring guest stars on the television series playing Benny's often-imposed-upon neighbors, in roles similar to those performed on radio by Ronald and Benita Colman (see below), although re-tailored for Stewart's on-screen persona.&lt;ref name=dun/&gt;
*[[Butterfly McQueen]] played Butterfly, the niece of Rochester. She worked as Mary Livingstone's maid.

Other cast members include:
*[[Ronald Colman]] and his wife, [[Benita Hume | Benita]]&amp;nbsp;– Themselves. Not actually members of the cast, they were among Benny's most popular guest stars on the radio series, portraying his long-suffering next-door neighbors. On the show, the Colmans were often revolted by Jack's eccentricities and by the fact that he always borrowed odds and ends from them (at one point, leading Ronald to exclaim, "Butter? Butter, butter!!!  Where does he think this is, [[Shangri-La]]???"). Dennis Day often impersonated Ronald Colman. In real life, the Colmans lived a few blocks away from Benny's home.
*[[Kenny Baker (singer/actor)|Kenny Baker]]&amp;nbsp;– The show's tenor singer who originally played the young, dopey character replaced by Dennis Day
*[[Andy Devine]]&amp;nbsp;– Jack's raspy-voiced friend who lived on a farm with his ma and pa. He usually told a story about his folks and life around the farm. His [[catchphrase]] was "Hiya, Buck!"
[[File:Sam Hearn 1935.jpg|thumb|150px|Sam Hearn as Schlepperman in 1935.]]
*Schlepperman (played by Sam Hearn)&amp;nbsp;– A Jewish character who spoke with a Yiddish accent (his catch phrase: "Hullo, Stranger!")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/880579526|title=From radio to the big screen: Hollywood films featuring broadcast personalities and programs|last=Hal|first=Erickson|publisher=McFarland|year=2014|isbn=0786477571|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|pages=40|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He would return again as the "Hiya, Rube!" guy, a hick farmer from the town of [[Calabasas]] who always insisted on referring to Jack as "rube".{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}
* Mr. Billingsly&amp;nbsp;– Played by writer and bit player Ed Beloin, Mr. Billingsly was a boarder who rented a room in Jack's home. Mr. Billingsly was a polite but very eccentric man.

* Larry Stevens&amp;nbsp;– Tenor singer who substituted for Dennis Day from November 1944 to March 1946, when Dennis served in the Navy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.
* Mary Kelly&amp;nbsp;– The Blue Fairy, a clumsy, overweight fairy who appeared in several storytelling episodes.  Kelly had been an old flame of Jack's, who had fallen on hard times. Benny was unsure of whether to give Kelly a regular role and instead appealed to friend George Burns who put her on his show in 1939 as Mary "Bubbles" Kelly, best friend to Gracie&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/714086527|title=George Burns : An American life|last=Epstein|first=Lawrence J.|date=2011|publisher=McFarland|year=|isbn=9780786458493|location=Jefferson, N.C.|pages=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Gisele Mackenzie]]&amp;nbsp;– Singer and violin player, she guest starred seven times on the program. Benny was co-[[executive producer]] of her NBC series ''[[The Gisele MacKenzie Show]]'' (1957–1958).
* Blanche Stewart&amp;nbsp;– A variety of characters and animal sounds&lt;ref name=dun/&gt;
* [[Barry Gordon]]&amp;nbsp;– Played Jack Benny as a child in a skit where Jack played his own father.
* [[Johnny Green]]&amp;nbsp;– The band leader until 1936 when Phil Harris joined the show.

Jack Benny first appeared on radio as a guest of [[Ed Sullivan]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopedia of Radio |author=C. Sterling |pages=250–254 |isbn=978-1-57958-249-4 |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  He was then given his own show later that year, with [[Canada Dry Ginger Ale]] as a sponsor &amp;mdash;'''''The Canada Dry Ginger Ale Program''''', beginning May 2, 1932, on the NBC [[Blue Network]] and continuing there for six months until October 26, moving the show to [[CBS]] on October 30&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/528397631|title=The biographical encyclopedia of American radio|last=Sterling|first=Christopher H.|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|others=|year=|isbn=0415995493|edition=|location=New York|pages=|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. With Ted Weems leading the band, Benny stayed on CBS until January 26, 1933.&lt;ref name=dun/&gt;

Arriving at [[NBC]] on March 17, Benny did '''''The Chevrolet Program''''' until April 1, 1934 with Frank Black leading the band. He continued with '''''The General Tire Revue''''' for the rest of that season, and in the fall of 1934, for [[General Foods]] as '''''The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny''''' (1934–42) and, when sales of [[Jell-O]] were affected by sugar rationing during [[World War II]],  '''''The Grape Nuts Flakes Program Starring Jack Benny''''' (later the Grape Nuts and Grape Nuts Flakes Program) (1942–44)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. On October 1, 1944, the show became '''''The Lucky Strike Program Starring Jack Benny''''', when [[American Tobacco]]'s [[Lucky Strike]] cigarettes took over as his radio sponsor, through the mid-1950s. By that time, the practice of using the sponsor's name as the title began to fade.

The show returned to CBS on January 2, 1949, as part of CBS president [[William S. Paley]]'s notorious "raid" of NBC talent in 1948-49. There it stayed for the remainder of its radio run, which ended on May 22, 1955&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. CBS aired repeats of previous 1953-55 radio episodes from 1956 to 1958 as '''''The Best of Benny'''''&lt;ref name=dun/&gt; for [[State Farm Insurance]], who later sponsored his television program from 1960 through 1965.

Jack Benny made his TV debut in 1949 with a local appearance on Los Angeles station [[KTTV]], then a [[CBS]] affiliate.&lt;ref&gt;April 4, 1949 Life Magazine article "Benny Tries TV", with photo and review&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 28,  1950, he made his full network debut over [[CBS]] Television&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-1950-jack-benny-hits-tv-gripes-a-lot-1.5320281|title=This Day in Jewish History // 1950: Jack Benny Takes Act to TV, Grumbling All the Way|last=Green|first=David B.|date=2014-10-28|work=Haaretz|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Benny's television shows were occasional broadcasts in his early seasons on TV, as he was still firmly dedicated to radio. The regular and continuing ''Jack Benny Program'' was telecast on [[CBS]] from October 28, 1950 to September 15, 1964 (finally becoming a weekly show in the 1960-1961 season), and on [[NBC]] from September 25, 1964 to September 10, 1965. 343 episodes were produced. His TV sponsors included [[American Tobacco]]'s [[Lucky Strike]] (1950–59), [[Lever Brothers]]' [[Lux]] (1959–60), [[State Farm Insurance]] (1960–65), [[Lipton]] Tea (1960–62), [[General Foods]]' [[Jell-O]] (1962–64), and [[Miles Laboratories]] (1964–65).

The television show was a seamless continuation of Benny's radio program, employing many of the same players, the same approach to situation comedy and some of the same scripts. The suffix "Program" instead of "Show" was also a carryover from radio, where "program" rather than "show" was used frequently for presentations in the non-visual medium. Occasionally, in several live episodes, the title card read ''The Jack Benny Show''.

''The Jack Benny Program'' appeared infrequently during its first two years on CBS-TV. Benny moved into television slowly: in his first season (1950–1951), he only performed on four shows, but by the 1951-1952 season, he was ready to do one show approximately every six weeks. In the third season (1952–1953), the show was broadcast every four weeks. During the 1953-1954 season, ''The Jack Benny Program'' aired every three weeks. From 1954 to 1960, the program aired every other week, rotating with such shows as ''[[Private Secretary (TV series)|Private Secretary]]'' and ''[[Bachelor Father (US TV series)|Bachelor Father]]''. Beginning in the 1960–1961 season, ''The Jack Benny Program'' began airing every week. The show moved from CBS to NBC prior to the 1964-65 season.  During the 1953-54 season, a handful of episodes were filmed during the summer and the others were live, a schedule which allowed Benny to continue doing his radio show. In the 1953–1954 season, Dennis Day had his own short-lived comedy and variety show on NBC, ''[[The Dennis Day Show]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/430850832|title=The complete directory to prime time network and cable TV shows, 1946-present|last=Brooks|first=Tim|last2=Marsh|first2=Earle|date=|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|others=|year=2009|isbn=0307483207|edition=Ninth|location=New York|pages=1127|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Live episodes (and later live on tape episodes) of ''The Jack Benny Program'' were broadcast from CBS Television City with live audiences.  Early filmed episodes were shot by [[Burns_and_Allen#McCadden_Productions|McCadden Productions]] at [[General Service Studios|Hollywood Center Studios]] and later by [[Desilu Productions]] at [[Desilu Cahuenga Studio|Red Studios Hollywood]] with an audience brought in to watch the finished film for live responses. Benny's opening and closing monologues were filmed in front of a live audience. However, from the late 1950s until the last season on NBC, a [[laugh track]] was utilized to augment audience responses.  By this time, all shows were filmed at [[Universal Television]].

In [[Jim Bishop]]'s book ''A Day in the Life of President Kennedy'', [[John F. Kennedy]] said that he was too busy to watch most television but that he made the time to watch ''The Jack Benny Program'' each week.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Jim. ''A Day in the Life of President Kennedy''&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of North America (being also one of the most popular shows on the CBC), one episode reportedly aired first in the United Kingdom (where one episode was filmed). Benny had also been a familiar figure on Australia since the mid-to-late 1930s with his radio show, and he made a special program for ATN-7 ''Jack Benny In Australia'' in March 1964, after a successful tour of Sydney and Melbourne.

[[James T. Aubrey]], the President of CBS Television and a man known for his abrasive and judgmental decision-making style, infamously told Benny in 1963, "you're through."&lt;ref name=NYTmag72&gt;Martin Kasindorf. "How now, Dick Daring?" ''[[The New York Times]] Magazine''. September 10, 1972. 54+.&lt;/ref&gt; Benny was further incensed when CBS placed an untested new sitcom, the ''[[Beverly Hillbillies]]'' spinoff ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', as his lead in. Benny had had a strong ratings surge the previous year when his series was moved to Tuesday nights with the popular [[Red Skelton]] Hour in the time slot prior to his. He feared a separation of their two programs might prove fatal. Early that fall he announced his show was moving back to NBC, where he was able to get the network to pick up another season.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1964/01/17/97160135.html?pageNumber=87 Adams, Val. "Benny Amenable on Time of Show / Comedian Is Willing to Abide by What N.B.C. Decides" (''The New York Times'', January 17, 1964, p.87)]&lt;/ref&gt; Benny's fears would prove to be unfounded; his ratings for the 1963–64 season remained strong while ''Petticoat Junction'' emerged as the most popular new series that fall. 

In his unpublished autobiography, ''I Always Had Shoes'' (portions of which were later incorporated by Benny's daughter, Joan, into her memoir of her parents, ''Sunday Nights at Seven'')&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children of Hollywood: Accounts of Growing Up as the Sons and Daughters of Stars|last=Vogel|first=Michelle|publisher=McFarland|year=2005|isbn=0786420464|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Benny said that he made the decision to end his TV series in 1965. He said that while the ratings were still good (he cited a figure of some 18 million viewers per week, although he qualified that figure by saying he never believed the ratings services were doing anything more than guessing), advertisers complained that commercial time on his show was costing nearly twice as much as what they paid for most other shows, and he had grown tired of what was called the "rat race."

The radio series was one of the most extensively preserved programs of its era, with the archive almost complete from 1936 onward and several episodes existing from before that (including the 1932 premiere). As with the radio shows, most of the television series has lapsed into the [[public domain]], although several episodes (particularly those made from 1961 onward, including the entire NBC-TV run) remain under copyright. During his lone NBC season, CBS aired repeats on weekdays and Sunday afternoons. 104 episodes personally selected by Benny and [[Irving Fein]], Benny's associate since 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-irving-fein-20120815-story.html|title=Irving Fein dies at 101; manager for Jack Benny, George Burns|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=15 August 2012|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, were placed into syndication in 1968 by [[NBCUniversal Television Distribution|MCA TV]]. Telecasts of the shows in the late evening were running as late as 1966.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Four early 1960s episodes were rerun on CBS during the summer of 1977. Edited 16mm prints ran on the [[CBN Cable Network]] in the mid 1980s. Restored versions first appeared on the short lived [[Ha! (TV channel)|HA!]] network in 1990.  As of 2011, the series has run on [[Antenna TV]], part of a long term official syndication distribution deal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antennatv.tv/shows/ Antenna TV - Shows]&lt;/ref&gt; The public domain television episodes have appeared on numerous stations, including PBS, while the radio series episodes have appeared in radio drama anthology series such as ''[[When Radio Was]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Home media==
Public domain episodes have been available on budget VHS/Beta tapes (and later DVDs) since the late seventies. [[MCA Inc.|MCA]] home video issued a 1960 version of the classic "Christmas Shopping" show in 1982 and a VHS set of ten filmed episodes in 1990. In 2008, 25 public domain episodes of the show, long thought lost, were located in a CBS vault.  The Jack Benny Fan Club, with the blessing of the Benny estate, offered to fund the [[digital preservation]] and release of these sealed episodes. CBS issued a press statement that any release was unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jackbenny.org/biography/other/cbs_permanently_seals_jack_benny.htm CBS permanently seals Jack Benny Television Masters]&lt;/ref&gt; June 2013 saw the first official release of 18 rare live Benny programs from 1956 to 1964 by [[Shout!

Whether on television or radio, the format of the ''Jack Benny Program'' never wavered. The program utilized a loose [[show-within-a-show]] format&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/843187620|title=Dreams in American Television Narratives: From Dallas to Buffy|last=Cynthia|first=Burkhead|date=|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9781441125231|location=London|pages=|oclc=|quote=The Jack Benny program, which self-referentially presented the story of producing a variety show, a show within a show...}}&lt;/ref&gt;, wherein the main characters were playing versions of themselves&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/844216841|title=Only Connect : a Cultural History of Broadcasting in the United States|last=Hilmes|first=Michele|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2013|isbn=1133307302|edition=Fourth|location=|pages=107|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The show often broke the [[fourth wall]], with the characters interacting with the audience and commenting on the program and its advertisements&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. The show would usually open with a song by the orchestra or banter between Benny and Don Wilson. There would then be banter between Benny and the regulars about the news of the day or about one of the [[running joke]]s on the program, such as Benny's age, Day's stupidity or Mary's letters from her mother. There would then be a song by the tenor followed by situation comedy involving an event of the week, a mini-play, or a satire of a current movie. Some shows were entire domestic sitcoms revolving around some aspect of Benny's life (e.g. spring cleaning or a violin lesson).&lt;ref name=dun/&gt;

==Racial attitudes==
Eddie Anderson was the first black man to have a recurring role in a national radio show, which was significant because at the time it was not uncommon for black characters to be played by white actors in [[blackface]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/kate-kelly/eddie-anderson-created-ro_b_4691017.html|title=Eddie Anderson Broke Racial Barriers With Role of 'Rochester' on The Jack Benny Program|last=Kelly|first=Kate|date=2014-01-29|website=Huffington Post|language=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Eddie Anderson's Rochester may be considered a [[stereotype]] by some, his attitudes were unusually sardonic for such a role. As was typical at the time in depicting class distinctions, Rochester always used a formal mode of address to the other (White) characters ("Mr. Benny", "Miss Livingston") and they always used a familiar mode in speaking to him ("Rochester") but the formal mode when speaking to him about another White character ("Mr. Benny" when speaking to Rochester but "Jack" when speaking to Jack).  In many routines, Rochester gets the better of Benny, often pricking his boss' ego, or simply outwitting him. The show's portrayal of black characters could be seen as advanced for its time; in a 1956 episode, African-American actor [[Roy Glenn]] plays a friend of Rochester, and he is portrayed as a well-educated, articulate man&lt;ref&gt;In this episode, he knows how to tell a fine violin: {{cite episode | network = CBS | series = The Jack Benny Program
| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cX5uLZ7zESY&amp;t=04m31s
| title = How Jack Found Mary| airdate =  31 October 1954 | season = 5 | episode=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; not as the typical "darkie stereotype" seen in many films of the time. Glenn's role was a recurring one on the series, where he was often portrayed as having to support two people on one unemployment check (i.e., himself and Rochester). Black talent was also showcased, with several guest appearances by [[The Ink Spots]] and others.

==Morocco refused to portray the program==
After the success of the first season, the team decided to add other countries to the list of countries in which the program is being filmed. The country was chosen from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]], Jordan and Europe from Germany, then from North Africa, Morocco, but the latter replaced Tunisia until the last words.

A '''tie-in''' work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a [[film]], [[video game]], [[television series]], [[board game]], [[web site]], [[role-playing game]] or [[literary property]].  Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of [[cross-promotion]] used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility.

== Types ==
[[File:Sacoche South Park.jpg|thumb|This pannier bag is a tie-in product from the [[Television program#Seasons/series|TV series]] ''[[South Park]]''.]]
Common tie-in products include literary works, which may be [[novelization]]s of a media property, original [[novel]]s or story collections inspired by the property, or republished previously existing books, such as the novels on which a media property was based, with artwork or photographs from the property. According to publishing industry estimates, about one or two percent of the audience of a film will buy its novelization, making these relatively inexpensively produced works a commercially attractive proposition in the case of [[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] film franchises. Although increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing has the disadvantages, from the writers' point of view, of modest pay, tight deadlines and no ownership in the intellectual property created.&lt;ref name="NYT 4 January 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alter|first1=Alexandra|title=Popular TV Series and Movies Maintain Relevance as Novels|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/05/business/media/popular-tv-series-and-movies-maintain-relevance-as-novels.html|accessdate=18 January 2015|work=The New York Times|date=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tie-in products may also have a documentary or supplemental character, such  or "making-of" books documenting the creation of a media property. Tie-in products also include other types of works based on the media property, such as [[soundtrack]] recordings, video games or merchandise including toys and clothing.

===Novelizations===
{{main|Novelization}}
A novelization is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.

===Other tie-in novels===
Tie-in novels are often newly published editions of a novel on which a film was based, sometimes renamed to match the film's title and using promotional art created for the film. For example, when [[Roderick Thorp]]'s 1979 novel ''[[Nothing Lasts Forever (1979 novel)|Nothing Lasts Forever]]'' was adapted into the 1988 film ''[[Die Hard]]'', the novel was republished as a paperback tie-in under the ''Die Hard'' title with the film's poster on the cover.

If a film is based on a story shorter than a novel — such as a [[short story]], [[Novella|novelette]], or [[novella]] — a tie-in book may be published featuring the adapted story as well as other stories from the same author. For example, when [[Stephen King]]'s novella ''[[Apt Pupil]]'' was adapted to [[Apt Pupil (film)|film]], the book originally featuring the story —  ''[[Different Seasons]]'' — was republished as ''Apt Pupil: A Novella in Different Seasons''. Similarly, tie-in novels were published to promote the films ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' and ''[[Paycheck (film)|Paycheck]]'', featuring the original "[[The Minority Report|Minority Report]]" and "[[Paycheck (short story)|Paycheck]]" short stories, both written by [[Philip K. Dick]].

Tie-in novels may also continue the story told in the original property, such as the many novels published as part of the [[Star Wars expanded universe|''Star Wars'' expanded universe]] set before or after the events of the original ''[[Star Wars]]'' film trilogy. In 2015, the ''[[New York Times]]'' noted the flourishing market for TV series tie-in novels, coinciding with the increasing cultural significance of quality television series. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has also been credited with these works gaining a "patina of respectability" after having previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.&lt;ref name="NYT 4 January 2015" /&gt;

===Video games===
Some [[video game]]s are tie-in licences for films, television shows or books.

Video game movie tie-ins are expensive for a [[video game developer|game developer]] to license, and the [[game designer]]s have to work within constraints imposed by the [[film studio]], under pressure to finish the game in time for the film's release.&lt;ref name="fox"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,277135,00.html|title=Review: Movie Tie-In Games Mostly Disappointing|work=foxnews.com | date=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim for the publishers is to increase hype and revenue as the two industries effectively market one another's releases.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/games/story.html?id=2285e0f0-a77a-4536-bec8-6aca99027d7c&amp;k=10775|title=Hollywood and video game industry profit from movie tie-ins|work=Canada.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106053417/http://www.canada.com/topics/technology/games/story.html?id=2285e0f0-a77a-4536-bec8-6aca99027d7c&amp;k=10775|archivedate=2012-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie license video games have a reputation for being poor quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Amiga Power |date=May 1995 |author= Stuart Campbell |url= http://worldofstuart.excellentcontent.com/world/ap/movies.htm | title = Ready For Your Close-Up }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''[[Amiga Power]]'' awarding [[Psygnosis]]'s three movie licenses (''Dracula'', ''Cliffhanger'' and ''Last Action Hero'', all reviewed in June 1994) 36% ''in total''; that magazine being cynical towards licensed games in general, with ''[[The Blues Brothers (video game)|The Blues Brothers]]'' being one of few exceptions. One of the first movie tie-in games, Atari's ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (video game)|E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' (1982) was deemed so bad, it was cited as one cause of the video game industry crash.&lt;ref name="washington"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/19/AR2006071901865.html |title=Movie and Game Studios Getting the Total Picture |accessdate=2007-11-01 |last=Musgrove |first=Mike |date=10 July 2006 |work= |publisher=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such poor quality is often due to game developers forced to rush the product in order to meet the movie's release date,&lt;ref name="washington" /&gt; or due to issues with adapting the original work's plot into an interactive form, such as in the case of the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1 (video game)|games]] based on the last two films of the ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'' film series, where one reviewer criticised some of the game's missions and side-quests as being unrelated to the film's storyline.&lt;ref name="hp7review"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ps3.ign.com/articles/113/1134912p1.html |title= Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 Video Game Review - PlayStation 3 Review at IGN |work= [[IGN]]|accessdate=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video tie-in licences for novels tend to be [[adventure games]]. ''[[The Hobbit (1982 video game)|The Hobbit]] (1982)'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (video game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' are [[text adventure]]s, whilst ''[[I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream (video game)|I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream]]'' (1995) is a [[point-and-click adventure]] and ''[[Neuromancer (video game)|Neuromancer]]'' (1988) is a [[graphic adventure]]. Action games based on novels are less common (''[[William Shatner's TekWar]]'' (1995), a [[first-person shooter]]). Novel tie-ins were published less frequently after the 1990s, with developers only taking risks with stories that had already been licensed for movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Why-Are-Books-Never-Made-Into-Games-6706.html|title=Why Are Books Never Made Into Games?|author=Rich Knight|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2009-03-01|work=Blend Games}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revenue and structure ==

Tie-ins are considered an important part of the revenue-stream for any major media release, and planning, and licensing for such works often begins at the very earliest stages of creating such a property. Tie-ins provide both an important way of generating additional income from a property, and a way of satisfying the desires of fans who enthusiastically support a popular media property.

The lineage of tie-in works can be quite convoluted.  For example, a novelization might be done of a video game, which was based on a television show, based on a movie, based on a comic book which was the original media property.  In several cases, a novelization has been released based on a movie which was in turn adapted from an original novel.  In such cases, it is not uncommon to see the novelization and a movie release of the original novel side-by-side on the same shelf.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

These tie-ins can be considered as forms of "free advertising", as they create more exposure for the media property. Tie-ins need not have a direct association with the property. For example, a particular pizza company can offer coupons that are associated with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle movies, but that specific pizza company itself does not necessarily have to appear in the movies. By this association, however, the pizza company is exposed to a bigger audience. If a media property does well, the tie-ins gain that positive exposure as well.&lt;ref&gt; Wasko, Janet, Mark Phillips, and Chris Purdie. 1993. "Hollywood Meets Madison Avenue: The Commercialization of US Films". Media, Culture &amp; Society 15(2): 271-293. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Early examples ==

Some early examples of TV tie-in books are ''[[Leave It to Beaver]]'' (1960), ''Here's Beaver!'' (1961), and ''Beaver and Wally'' (1961) by [[Beverly Cleary]] and ''[[Star Trek]]'' (1967) by [[James Blish]].

'''''Timthal Baghdad (Baghdad's Statue)''''' is a public monument in Baghdad, created by the sculptor, [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]] (1929-2011) and inaugurated in 2013. It is a tall column with a woman dressed in [[Abassid]] costume sitting on the top. The column is inscribed with Arabic letters, taken from a famous Arabic poem by eminent poet, Mustafa Jamal al-Din. The statue is intended to glorify both the city and its ancient heritage.

==Background==

In 2010, the Mayor of Baghdad commissioned the sculptor, Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, to complete a series of four monuments as part of a Baghdad Culture program. The artist began work on four new sculptures to be erected in various locations around Baghdad. However, this would be his final project, for the sculptor died before it was completed. Ghani's son oversaw the completion of the project.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes], Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; All four works blended Iraqi tradition with modern techniques and materials. 

The first to be completed was ''Al Fanous El Sehri'' (Magic Lantern) inaugurated in 2011. The remaining three works, ''Ashaar Baghdad'' (Baghdad's Poetry), a fountain featuring Arabic script; ''Timthal Baghdad,'' (Baghdad's Statue) a column featuring the city as a beautiful girl, wearing traditional [[Abassid]] costume.&lt;ref name=Arraf&gt;Arraf, J., "Renowned Iraqi sculptor has vision for Baghdad to 'flower again'," ''CS Monitor,'' 16 February, 2011; [https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0216/Renowned-Iraqi-sculptor-has-vision-for-Baghdad-to-flower-again Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; and  ''Enkath El Iraq'' (Saving Iraq's Culture), a Sumerian cylindrical seal in the hands of an Iraqi citizen;&lt;ref name=Arraf/&gt; were all inaugurated in 2013.&lt;ref name=Dawood&gt;Dawood, M., "Mohamed Ghani Hikmat brings life back to the squares of Baghdad Months after the Departure of the "Sheikh of the Sculptors," ''Alrai Media'', January, 2012, [http://www.alraimedia.com/Home/Details?Id=0c161045-cd85-4208-a9e6-31d4e3ee4c27 Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mohammed Ghani Hikmat was known for his public works, now on display throughout Baghdad's urban spaces, and also for smaller statues carved in wood, depicting the everyday life of Baghdad's people.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes], Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx Online:] &lt;/ref&gt; His most well-known works include a pair of statues of ''[[Scheherazade|Queen Scheherazade]] and [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|King Shahryar]]'', located on the banks of the Tigris River, near Abu Nuwas Street&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, M.S., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Iraqi Sculptor, Dies at 82", ''New York Times'', 21 September, 2011 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/arts/design/mohammed-ghani-hikmat-iraqi-sculptor-dies-at-82.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Fountain of Kahramana'' in Baghdad's central business district.&lt;ref&gt;Antoon, S., "Living With Death in Baghdad", ''New York Times'', 20  July, 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/opinion/living-with-death-in-baghdad.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of location for his works, was important to Ghani, who wanted the sculptures to be accessible to all. He avoided public squares and gardens, but instead wanted his works to be situated in the streets and on the side of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Jairath. S., "Baghdad will Remain Baghdad" Mohammed Ghani and his Tales of One Thousand and One Nights", ''Meanjin'' Vol 74, Issue 3, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
Timthal Baghdad (or Baghdad's Statue) (pictured) is a 13.5 metre column which features Arabic calligraphy along its length.

==Description==

The first of the three sculptures inaugurated in 2013 was Timthal Baghdad (Baghdad’s Statue, pictured).&lt;ref name=official&gt;"Official Inauguration of Three Sculptures in Iraq Baghdad," ''Alsamuria News,'' 13 February, 2013 [https://www.alsumaria.tv/news/71811/official-inauguration-of-three-sculptures-in-iraq/en# Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a column featuring a lady sitting on a chair wearing Abbassid traditional clothes and is located in Andalusia square (Al Andalus). The overall height of the column is 13.5 metres (10.5 metre base and 3 metres for the figure), making it one of the tallest monuments in the city centre..&lt;ref name=official/&gt;                       

The column features poetry by the great poet, Mustafa Jamal al-Din, which glorify the city of Baghdad.&lt;ref name=Dawood/&gt;  The verse reads in part:
{{Blockquote|Baghdad, what did you do?

Only let your green window shine

You passed the world and your morning is sunny

And I will judge you, and your night will be moonlit}}

The figure of the Abassid woman is reclining, with her back to the sun, so that she is looking towards the horizon in front of her. The woman is intended to signify that the country's ancestors were from the East. This reference is another reference objectively tied to the base of the monument.&lt;ref&gt;"Statue of Baghdad by sculptor Mohamed Ghani Hikmat" ''Ministry of Culture'' [Government of Iraq], 2013, [http://mocul.gov.iq/index.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;op=PrintPage&amp;sid=1071 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ultra-Lettrist''' movement was an art form developed by Jean-Louis Brau, [[Gil J Wolman]], and [[François Dufrêne]], in the 1950s, when they split from [[Isidore Isou]]'s [[Lettrism]]. 

They issued a periodical called ''grammeS: Review of the Ultra-Lettriste Group'', which ran for seven issues between 1957 and 1961. They used their journal to publish [[hypergraphics]]  which included exchanges and discussions with the Lettrists' ''Poésie Nouvelle'' and the [[Situationist International]].

Some Ultra-Lettrists went on to form the [[Nouveau réalisme]] school while others joined the Situationist International.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sa_hymCZQQIC&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=Ultra%20Lettrist%20group&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q=Ultra%20Lettrist%20group&amp;f=false Craig J.

'''Walter W. Horn''' (18 January 1908 – 26 December 1995) was a [[medieval studies|medievalist scholar]] noted for his work on the [[Timber framing|timber]] [[vernacular architecture|vernacular]] [[medieval architecture|architecture of the Middle Ages]]. He was born in [[Germany]], but fled [[Nazism]] and spent most of his [[academia|academic career]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he became the university system's first [[art historian]] and co-founded the History of Art department. A [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]], Horn served in the [[U.S. Army]] during [[World War II]] and then in the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|special intelligence unit]] that tracked down [[Nazi plunder|art works plundered by the Nazis]]. His most celebrated exploit was the recovery of the [[crown jewels]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], also known as [[Charlemagne]]'s [[Imperial Regalia]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Eugene Kleinbauer, James Marrow and Ruth Mellinkoff, "Memoirs of [[Fellow#Academia|Fellows]] and Corresponding Fellows of the [[Medieval Academy of America]]: Walter W. Horn," ''Speculum'' 71 (1996), p. 800 ("his most important piece of detective work led to the recovery of the coronation regalia of the Holy Roman Empire"); "Walter Horn," ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 30 December 1995, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/12/30/MN38089.DTL&amp;type=printable obituary]; University of California (System) Academic Senate, "1996, University of California: In Memoriam,"
[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text "Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley"] ("his most spectacular feat was the recovery of Charlemagne's ceremonial regalia").&lt;/ref&gt; As a scholar, Horn is most noted for his work on the medieval [[architectural drawing]] known as the [[Plan of Saint Gall]].

==Early life==
Horn was born in the town of [[Waldangelloch]] in rural [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]]. His mother was Matilde Peters; she married Karl Horn, a [[Lutheran]] minister. Walter [[Education in Germany|attended a ''Gymnasium'']] in nearby [[Heidelberg]] and went on to study [[art history]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]] and the [[University of Berlin]]. He earned his [[doctorate]] in 1934 at the [[University of Hamburg]], studying under [[Erwin Panofsky]]. His [[dissertation]], ''Die Fassade von Saint-Gilles'', on the [[façade]] of [[Saint-Gilles, Gard]], was published in 1937.

==World War II era==
[[File:Weltliche Schatzkammer Wien (169)pano2.jpg|thumb|150px|As a [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program|special intelligence officer]], Horn recovered the "crown of Charlemagne", part of the [[Imperial Regalia]] hidden by the Nazis]]
Horn fled Germany in opposition to the Nazi regime. He continued his studies from 1934 to 1937 as a research associate at the German Institute for the History of Art in [[Florence, Italy]]. In 1938, Horn moved to the [[United States]] and began his long association with the University of California, Berkeley, as a [[lecturer]]. A year later, he was given a permanent position as the first art historian in the University of California system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text UC In Memoriam], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he married Ann Binkley Rand.

Horn became a [[naturalized citizen]] in 1943. That same year, he volunteered for [[military duty]] in the [[U.S. Army]]. By 1945, he was a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Third United States Army|Third Army]] under General [[George S. Patton]]. Horn's skills as a native speaker of [[German language|German]] were put to use in [[interrogation|interrogating]] [[prisoners of war]]. After the war, he continued as a special investigator in the [[Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program]], using his expertise as an art historian to track down [[Nazi plunder|art that had been stolen or concealed by the Nazis]]. Horn served until 1946, attaining the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]].

In 1946, Horn succeeded in recovering the [[Imperial Regalia]] of [[Charlemagne]], the [[Imperial Crown of the Holy Roman Empire|crown]], [[sceptre]], and [[Imperial Regalia#Components|jewels]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. These had been kept hidden by Germans who hoped to return to power even after their defeat by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]].
&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text UC In Memoriam.]&lt;/ref&gt; The incident has been elaborated, sometimes with inaccuracies, by writers who take particular interest in the [[Holy Lance]], the spear supposed to have pierced the side of [[Jesus]] during [[Crucifixion of Jesus|his crucifixion]]. This artifact is sometimes called the Spear of Destiny and identified with the [[Holy Lance#Vienna Lance (Hofburg spear)|Vienna Lance]], one of the components of the regalia. In speculative works of [[non-fiction]] that endow the lance with [[National Socialism and Occultism|occult powers or mystical significance in Nazism]],&lt;ref&gt;See Trevor Ravenscroft, ''The Spear of Destiny: The Occult Power behind the Spear Which Pierced the Side of Christ'' (Red Wheel, 1982). Ravenscroft reproduces a portion of Horn's report on the recovery of the regalia (called there "insignia"), [https://books.google.com/books?id=BKt_4HbED6AC&amp;pg=PA348&amp;lpg=PA348&amp;dq=spear+%22Walter+W.+Horn%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F3xrA_ZVM1&amp;sig=Pku4BJhvr_4T9V8nLeZdLbCtIXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pWtvSpmaOIbiNe7kqdoI&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 p. 348.] For issues raised by Ravenscroft's methodology, see [[Holy Lance#Trevor Ravenscroft|Holy Lance: Trevor Ravenscroft]].&lt;/ref&gt; Horn appears in narratives about its retrieval from the possession of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;A detailed version by Jerry E. Smith and George Piccard, ''Secrets of the Holy Lance: The Spear of Destiny in History and Legend'' (Adventures Unlimited Press, 2005), pp. 267–270 [https://books.google.com/books?id=qGX3ZtD_UikC&amp;pg=PA267&amp;dq=%22The+Hunt+for+the+Spear+In+1945%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3  online]; see also E. Randall Floyd, ''100 of the World's Greatest Mysteries'' (Harbor House, 2000), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uM1Fx9og0B4C&amp;pg=PA262&amp;dq=%22Finally,+on+April+30,+1945,+U.S.+troops%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3 pp. 262–263]; Lionel Fanthorpe and Patricia Fanthorpe, ''Mysteries and Secrets of the Templars: The Story behind the Da Vinci Code'' (Dundurn Press Ltd., 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=rcErzxJsJlIC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=%22It+was+also+part+of+the+lance%27s+legend%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3 p. 57.]&lt;/ref&gt; Usually identified as "Lt. Walter William Horn," he is said to have retrieved the lance at the behest of Patton on the very day of Hitler's death, that is, 30 April 1945.

==The McCarthy era==
Returning from the war, Horn married Alberta West Parker, a [[physician]], who became a Clinical Professor of Public Health at UC Berkeley.&lt;ref&gt;San Francisco Chronicle, March 31, 2012, [http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=alberta-horn&amp;pid=156776720#fbLoggedOut  Alberta Horn, obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Horn and his family became embroiled in the controversy at his university over a [[loyalty oath]] requirement. During the era of the [[Cold War]], the [[Red Scare]], and [[McCarthyism]], the [[Board of Regents]] at the University of California began to require that all university employees sign an oath affirming their loyalty to the [[California constitution|state constitution]] and denying their membership or belief in organizations advocating the overthrow of the [[U.S. government]]. The requirement met with resistance, and in the summer of 1950 thirty-one [[Professors in the United States|professors]]&lt;ref&gt;Along with a number of other employees.&lt;/ref&gt; who refused to sign were fired, despite their stature as "internationally distinguished scholars."&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/symposium/index.html The University Loyalty Oath.]&lt;/ref&gt; Horn's fellow [[medieval studies|medievalist]] [[Ernst Kantorowicz]] resigned rather than sign the oath, stating his reasons in two letters to the [[university president]] that were only published in English decades after the episode. Kantorowicz also presented a letter from Horn, who had signed the oath under protest. In the letter dated 23 August 1950, Horn, then acting [[chairman]] of the art department, pointed to his former military service and to his voluntary [[reactivation]] that same month as a [[reservist]] in the [[United States armed forces|Armed Services]].

{{quote|Being thus confronted a second time with a disruption of my academic career, and feeling unable to expose my wife and my son to the consequences of being denied continuance of my civilian occupation upon return from military duty, it is with profound regret that I find myself compelled to yield to the pressure which the Regents saw fit to exercise in order to extort from me a declaration concerning my political beliefs. I am enclosing the requested statement, signed. I should like to make known that, in doing so, I am acting against the better precepts of my [[conscience]] and for no other reason than that of protecting my family against the contingencies of economic distress. … It was in avoidance of pressures of this type that I left Germany in 1938 and came to this country. And it was in the desire of contributing to the eradication of such methods that I volunteered during the last war to take up arms against the country of my birth. I am expecting my recall to active duty [[Korean War#Escalation|in the present conflict]] with the bitter feeling that, this time, I shall be fighting abroad for the defense and propagation of [[Freedoms]] which I have been denied in my professional life at home.}}

Kantorowicz noted that Horn's letter "illustrates the grave conflict of conscience and savage [[economic coercion]] to which, after fifteen months of pressure and struggle, he had finally to yield."&lt;ref&gt;Horn's letter appears following two letters by Kantorowicz at The University Loyalty Oath: A 50th Anniversary Retrospective, [http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/uchistory/archives_exhibits/loyaltyoath/symposium/kantorowicz.html "The Fundamental Issue."]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career and scholarship==
[[File:Firenze.Baptistry06.JPG|thumb|200px|Horn established methods for dating with his work on the [[Florence Baptistry]]]]
[[File:Great Coxwell Tithe Barn c.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Great Coxwell Barn]] was one of two Cistercian structures studied by Horn and [[Ernest Born]] for their first book]]
Horn's early position as research associate in Florence gave him firsthand knowledge of the city's [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|medieval church architecture]] and produced two important studies, ''Das Florentiner Baptisterium'' (1938), an analysis of the fabric and ornamentation of the [[Florence Baptistry]] that established new criteria for its dating, and ''[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] Churches in Florence: A Study of Their [[Chronology]] and Stylistic Development'' (1943), which included an examination of the [[masonry]] construction of [[San Miniato al Monte]]. Throughout his career, he continued to explore the conceptual connections between [[Classical architecture|classical]] and northern architecture.&lt;ref name="content.cdlib.org"&gt;[http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text "Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley"]&lt;/ref&gt; His specialty was [[Aisle#Cathedral architecture|three-aisled]] timber structures in medieval churches, [[Market house|market halls]] and [[manor house|manor halls]]. He was known for arriving at a precise dating of medieval buildings through studying [[Architectural engineering|their technologies]] and observing the physical evidence, drawing on scientific disciplines; he dated timber structures with reference to [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon analysis]] and [[Dendrochronology|dendrochronological tables]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 801. See, for example, Walter Horn, "The Potential and Limitations of Radiocarbon Dating in the Middle Ages," in ''Scientific Methods in Medieval Archaeology'', edited by [[Rainer Berger]] (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1970), pp. 23-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Horn published what is considered his most important article,&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir,"  p. 800.&lt;/ref&gt; "On the Origins of the Medieval Bay System" in the ''Journal of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]]''. He argued that [[Bay (architecture)|bay]]-divided [[Cathedral architecture of Western Europe|medieval churches]] derived from [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] timber buildings and represented a continuous tradition of [[vernacular architecture]] in [[transalpine]] Europe. Horn was the first to assemble the known timber examples, which dated from as early as 1200 BC and extended into the medieval period. Because traces of early wooden structures were often scanty or oblique, Horn used scientific methods to uncover their architectural principles, and demonstrated that these were developed and applied to stone [[cathedral]]s in the Romanesque and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] periods.&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 800; [http://content.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;brand=calisphere&amp;doc.view=entire_text "Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley"]; [http://www.dictionaryofarthistorians.org/hornw.htm Dictionary of Art Historians.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1958 article was significant also in that it marked Horn's first collaboration with [[Ernest Born]], the [[San Francisco|San Franciscan]] architect and [[draftsman]] with whom he was to author a series of books and articles over the next twenty years. Their first book was ''The Barns of the [[Beaulieu Abbey|Abbey of Beaulieu]] at Its [[wikt:grange|Granges]] of [[Great Coxwell Barn|Great Coxwell]] and Beaulieu St. Leonard'' (1965), a study of the only two [[Cistercian]] [[tithe barn]]s, dating from the 13th century, that survive in England.&lt;ref name="content.cdlib.org" /&gt; But their major project was the three-volume work ''The Plan of St. Gall: A Study of the Architecture and Economy of, and Life in a Paradigmatic [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] Monastery'', which has been called "one of the greatest [[monograph]]s on medieval architecture that has ever appeared."&lt;ref name="Kleinhauer p. 801"&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 801.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plan of St. Gall===
[[File:Pianta dell'abbazia di san gallo, 816-830, san gallo, stiftbibliothek.jpg|left|thumb|250px|The [[Plan of Saint Gall]]]]
The [[plan of Saint Gall]] had engaged Horn's imagination and curiosity since he was introduced to it by his mentor [[Erwin Panofsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 800.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1957, Horn had participated in an international [[academic conference|congress]] on the plan, and his interest in its guest and service buildings led to his survey of medieval structures in France and England. In 1965, Horn and Born contributed to the creation of a [[scale model]] of the 40 buildings rendered on the plan. The model was displayed at the international exhibit ''[[Charlemagne|Karl der Grosse]]'' held at [[Aachen]]. Their two decades of collaboration culminated in a work of 1,056 pages with an estimated 1,200 illustrations.

''The Plan of St. Gall'' was praised by French historian [[Emmanuel LeRoy Ladurie]] for its "prodigious scholarship," and for its wide-ranging elucidation of [[Carolingian Renaissance|Carolingian]] daily life.&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;William Grimes, "Walter Horn, 87, a Historian Of Medieval Cloisters and Barns," ''[[New York Times]]'' 29 December 1995,  [https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/nyregion/walter-horn-87-a-historian-of-medieval-cloisters-and-barns.html?pagewanted=print obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; The first volume offers a reconstruction of the church and the living quarters for a [[Christian monasticism|community of monks]] numbering about a hundred. The second volume covered the guest and service buildings and the [[Medieval gardening|horticultural]] spaces for growing vegetables, medicinal herbs, and fruit and nut trees. The third volume contains supplemental material such as Horn's 88-page catalogue of the plan's explanatory ''tituli'', or captions, and [[Charles W. Jones (medievalist)|Charles W. Jones]]' English translation of the ''Consuetudines Corbienses'' by [[Adalard of Corbie|Adalhard]] of the [[abbey of Corbie]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Charles W. Jones (medievalist)|Charles W. Jones]] for more on this collaboration.&lt;/ref&gt; Through meticulous reimagining of the activities that the architecture was meant to facilitate, Horn presents a rich picture of Carolingian life and thought.

The most controversial aspect of the work was Horn's major thesis: that the plan was a copy of a lost [[blueprint|master plan]] dating to 816 or 817 that would have been part of documents pertaining to the official monastic reform movement under [[Louis the Pious]] at Aachen. The dominant strand of criticism to the contrary holds that the plan was intended to represent an ideal and was never meant to be carried out at a particular site. Horn's last article on the plan, "The Medieval Monastery as a Setting for the Production of Manuscripts,"&lt;ref&gt;Co-authored with Born in the ''Journal of the Walters Art Gallery'' 44 (1986) 16–47.&lt;/ref&gt; was a response to this criticism.&lt;ref name="Kleinhauer p. 801" /&gt;

''The Plan of St. Gall'' earned twelve major awards for its scholarship, [[bookbinding|bookmaking]], and [[typography]], including a prize from France's [[Académie d'architecture]] and a 1982 medal from the [[American Institute of Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," p. 801; Grimes, ''NYT'' obituary.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later work===
In 1974, Horn retired to [[emeritus]] status after 36 years at the University of California. His last publication, ''The Forgotten [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|Hermitage]] of [[Skellig Michael]]'' (1990), co-authored with Jenny White Marshall and Grellan D. Rourke, resulted from [[fieldwork]] begun in 1978 on [[List of islands of Ireland|Ireland's Atlantic offshore islands]]. His interest in the Celtic [[Roundhouse (dwelling)|roundhouse]] had been indicated earlier in "On the Origins of the Medieval Cloister" (1973).

===Honors and administrative achievements===
Horn worked with [[classical archaeologist]] [[Darrell A. Amyx]] to establish History of Art as a separate department at the University of California in 1971. He was a [[Fellow#Academia|fellow]] of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1970) and of the [[Medieval Academy of America]] (1980). Horn was an active supporter of arts institutions outside academia, serving as [[trustee]] of the [[Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco]] and chairman of the museum's acquisitions committee.&lt;ref&gt;''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', 30 December 1995, [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/12/30/MN38089.DTL&amp;type=printable obituary "Walter Horn."]&lt;/ref&gt; He was on the board of the [[College Art Association]] 1950–54 and 1964–68 and on the board of the [[Society of Architectural Historians]] 1964–68.

==Death==
Horn died at home of [[pneumonia]] on Tuesday, 26 December 1995, at [[Point Richmond, Richmond, California|Point Richmond]], California. He was 87. He was survived by his wife, Alberta; his son, Michael; two daughters, Rebecca and Robin; and a grandson, Matthew. His [[obituary]] in the ''[[New York Times]]'' labeled him "historian of medieval [[cloister]]s and [[barn]]s."&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; Horn was remembered by colleagues as one of the university's "best-loved and most influential teachers and … most effective leaders."&lt;ref&gt;"Walter Horn, History of Art: Berkeley," [http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb0z09n6nn&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00030&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id= Calisphere.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was eulogized for "his oratorical skills and uncanny ability to bring the medieval building or pile of [[ruins]] vividly to life. His eloquence and grace matched his endless curiosity about prehistoric and medieval buildings in northern Europe and how people utilized them."&lt;ref&gt;Kleinhauer ''et al.'', "Memoir," pp. 801–802.&lt;/ref&gt;
