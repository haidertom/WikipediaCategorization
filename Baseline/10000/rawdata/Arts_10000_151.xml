'''Abramtsevo''' ({{lang-ru|Абра́мцево}}) is an estate located north of [[Moscow]], in the proximity of [[Khotkovo]], that became a center for the [[Slavophile]] movement and artistic activity in the 19th century. The estate is located in the [[Abramtsevo, Sergiyevo-Posadsky District, Moscow Oblast|selo of the same name]], in [[Sergiyevo-Posadsky District]] of [[Moscow Oblast]].

==History==
Originally owned by author [[Sergei Aksakov]], other writers and artists — such as [[Nikolai Gogol]] — at first came there as his guests. Under Aksakov, visitors to the estate discussed ways of ridding Russian art of Western influences to revive a purely national style. In 1870, eleven years after Aksakov's death, it was purchased by [[Savva Mamontov]], a wealthy industrialist and patron of the arts.

Under Mamontov, Russian themes and folk art flourished there. During the 1870s and 1880s, Abramtsevo hosted a colony of artists who sought to recapture the quality and spirit of medieval Russian art in the manner parallel to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] in [[Great Britain]]. Several workshops were set up there to produce handmade furniture, ceramic tiles, and silks imbued with traditional Russian imagery and themes.

Working together in a cooperative spirit, the artists [[Vasily Polenov]] and [[Viktor Vasnetsov]] designed a plain but picturesque church, with murals painted by Polenov, Vasnetsov and his brother, a gilded [[iconostasis]] by [[Ilya Repin]] and [[Mikhail Nesterov]], and folklore-inspired sculptures by [[Viktor Hartmann]] and [[Mark Antokolsky]]. Towards the turn of the 20th century, drama and opera on Russian folklore themes (e.g., [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''[[The Snow Maiden]]'') were produced in Abramtsevo by the likes of [[Konstantin Stanislavsky]], with sets contributed by Vasnetsov, [[Mikhail Vrubel]], and other distinguished artists.

==Museum==
Abramtsevo is now open to the public and tourists can wander along the many paths through the surrounding forest and cross the wooden bridges that served as an inspiration for the artists at the Abramtsevo Colony. They can also visit many of the buildings to see works produced by the artists at the colony, e.g., a wooden bathhouse in the shape of a traditional dwelling of [[Ancient Rus]], designed by [[Ivan Ropet]],  and the House on Chicken Legs, a fairy-tale abode of an evil witch, [[Baba Yaga]], designed by Vasnetsov. One building, the main "manor," is said to have been the model for the estate in which [[Anton Chekhov]] set ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]''.

'''''Barge Haulers on the Volga''''' or '''''[[Burlak]]i''''' (Russian: '''''Burlaki na Volge''''', '''''Бурлаки на Волге''''') is an 1870–73 oil-on-canvas painting by the [[Social realism|realist]] artist [[Ilya Repin]]. It depicts 11 men physically dragging a [[barge]] on the banks of the [[Volga River]]. They are at the point of collapse from exhaustion, oppressed by heavy, hot weather.&lt;ref name="Frank111"&gt;Frank, Joseph. "Dostoevsky: The Mantle of the Prophet, 1871–1881". Princeton University Press, 2003. 111. {{ISBN|0-691-11569-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not long after Repin's painting, burlakis were replaced by steam powered tug-boats&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is a condemnation of profit from inhumane labor.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosalind Polly Gray|Gray, Rosalind Polly]]. ''Russian genre painting in the nineteenth century''. Alderley: Clarendon Press, 2000. ix. {{ISBN|0-19-820875-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are presented as stoical and accepting, the men are defeated; only one stands out: in the center of both the row and canvas, a brightly colored youth fights against his leather binds and takes on a heroic pose.

Repin conceived the painting during his travels through Russia as a young man and depicts actual characters he encountered. It drew international praise for its realistic portrayal of the hardships of working men, and launched his career.&lt;ref name="AH"&gt;Hilton, Alison. "The Exhibition of Experiments in St. Petersburg and the Independent Sketch". ''The Art Bulletin'', Volume 70, No. 4, December, 1988. 677–698&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after its completion, the painting was purchased by  [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich]] and exhibited widely throughout Europe as a landmark of Russian realist painting. ''Barge Haulers on the Volga'' has been described as "perhaps the most famous painting of the [[Peredvizhniki]] movement [for]....its unflinching portrayal of  backbreaking labor".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tmora.org/educationData/JaneFriedman.html Ilya Repin, Barge-Haulers on the Volga (1870–73)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201085918/http://www.tmora.org/educationData/JaneFriedman.html |date=1 February 2010 }}". [[The Museum of Russian Art]]. Retrieved 18 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:burlaks walking.jpg|thumb|1900s photograph of [[burlaks]] on the Volga River]]
Repin was accepted into the Imperial Academy of Art in St. Petersburg in 1863. The academy at the time was known for its deep conservatism and leaning towards academic art, a fact that bred a sense of revolt and desire for change in many of its students.&lt;ref name="AK" /&gt;

''Barge Haulers'' was inspired by scenes witnessed by Repin while holidaying on the Volga in 1870. He made a number of preparatory studies, mostly in oil, while staying in Shiriaev Buerak, near [[Tolyatti|Stavropol]] (Stavropol-na-Volge).&lt;ref name="AK"&gt;King, Averil. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PAL/is_547_166/ai_n27411815/ Russia's soul in paint: Averil King welcomes a well-illustrated account of Ilya Repin's powerful, virtuoso art]". ''Apollo'', October 2007. Retrieved on 27 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CA"&gt;"[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=300029 Study of a Barge Hauler for the painting 'The Barge Haulers on the Volga' 1870–1873]". [[Christie's]], November 1997. Retrieved on 27 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The sketches include landscapes, and views of the Volga and barge haulers.
[[File:burlakwomen.jpg|thumb|left|Burlak women, 1900s]]
The characters are based on actual people Repin came to know while preparing for the work. He had had difficulty finding subjects to pose for him, even for a fee, because of a folklorish belief that a subject's [[soul]] would leave his possession once his image was put down on paper.&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, Caryl. ''The life of Musorgsky''. In: "Musical lives". ''Cambridge University Press'', 1999. 127. {{ISBN|0-521-48507-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects include a former soldier, a former priest, and a painter.&lt;ref name="AM134"&gt;Amery, Colin. "St Petersburg". Frances Lincoln, 2006. 134. {{ISBN|0-7112-2492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he depicted eleven men, women also performed the work and there were normally many more people in a barge-hauling gang; Repin selected these figures as representative of a broad swathe of the working classes of Russian society. That some had once held relatively high social positions dismayed the young artist, who had initially planned to produce a far more superficial work contrasting exuberant day-trippers (which he himself had been) with the careworn burlaks. Repin found a particular empathy with Kanin, the defrocked priest, who is portrayed as the lead hauler and looks outwards towards the viewer.&lt;ref name="P&amp;P"&gt;Parker &amp; Parker, 23&lt;/ref&gt; The artist wrote,
:"There was something eastern about it, the face of a [[Scythia|Scyth]]...and what eyes! What depth of vision!...And his brow, so large and wise...He seemed to me a colossal mystery, and for that reason I loved him. Kanin, with a rag around his head, his head in patches made by himself and then worn out, appeared none the less as a man of dignity; he was like a saint."&lt;ref name="AM"&gt;Amery, Colin &amp; Curran, Brian. "St Petersburg". Frances Lincoln, 2006. 134. {{ISBN|0-7112-2492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Ilja Jefimowitsch Repin 010.jpg|thumb|''Barge Haulers Crossing a Ford'', Ilya Repin, oil on canvas, 1872. 62 × 97 cm. The State Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow.]]
''Barge Haulers on the Volga'' shows a row of eleven male [[burlak]]s dragging a barge on the [[Volga River]] that must be pulled upstream against the current.&lt;ref name="B138"&gt;Bolton (1999), 138&lt;/ref&gt; The men are dressed in rags and bound with leather harnesses. They are rendered as mostly stoical, although in obvious physical discomfort, with their bodies bowed in toil.&lt;ref name="AM134"&gt;Amery, Colin. "St Petersburg". Frances Lincoln, 2006. 134. {{ISBN|0-7112-2492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scene is rendered in a white, silvery light which has been described as "almost Venetian".&lt;ref name="P&amp;P"&gt;Parker &amp; Parker, 23&lt;/ref&gt; In earlier studies, it was dominated by blue tones.

The men appear to be unsupervised and form the focus of the picture, with the barge relegated to a minor role at the rear of the frame. Further in the distance is a tiny steam-powered boat,&lt;ref name="VV"&gt;Stasov , Vladimir Vasilyevich. "Letter to the Editor of 'St. Petersburg Gazette' (1873)". ''Saint Petersburg Gazette'', no. 176, 18 March 1873&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps a suggestion that the back-breaking labor of the barge haulers is no longer necessary in the industrial age.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Aaron J. "Imagining the unimaginable: World War, modern art, &amp; the politics of public culture in Russia, 1914–1917". ''Studies in war, society, and the military''. University of Nebraska Press, 2008. 25. {{ISBN|0-8032-1547-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also worthy of note is the inverted Russian flag flying from the main mast of the barge, adding to the sense of hostile unease. Repin echoes the stop-go rhythm of the labor in the undulating line of the workers' heads.  In the preparatory studies, many of the figures were positioned differently; for example the second man was shown wearing a cap with his head bowed into his chest.&lt;ref name="P&amp;P" /&gt;

[[File:Gustave Courbet 018.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Stone Breakers]]'', [[Gustave Courbet]], 1850. Destroyed]]
There is a general sense of mounting exhaustion and despair moving from left to right among the group; the last hauler seems oblivious to his surroundings and drifts from the line out towards the viewer. The exception is a fair-haired boy in the center of the group. Set brightly against the uniform muted tones of his companions, he stands straighter; his head is raised looking into the distance, while he pulls against his straps as if determined to free himself from his task.

&lt;!-- [[File:Burial at Ornans.jpg|260px|thumb|''[[A Burial at Ornans]]'', Gustave Courbet, 1850. [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]] --&gt;
Repin grew up in [[Chuhuiv|Chuguev]], in the [[Kharkov Governorate]] (now [[Ukraine]]) and was aware of the poverty and hardship of most rural life at that time. He spent two years traveling, during which time he observed both the [[dacha]]s of the rich and the toil of the common peasant. As such the painting can be considered a [[Genre works|genre work]],&lt;ref name="Frank111" /&gt; but treated on the heroic scale of [[history painting]], as was often the case in 19th-century works, especially after ''[[A Burial At Ornans]]'' by [[Gustave Courbet]] (1850).  ''Barge Haulers'' drew direct comparisons from critics with [[Jean-François Millet|Millet]]'s works and Courbet's ''[[The Stone Breakers]]'' (also 1850), which showed laborers at the side of a road.&lt;ref name="V208"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alpatov, 251&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is a relentlessly physical description of the men; Repin was attracted by their strength and superhuman effort. According to critic [[Vladimir Stassov]], "They are like a group of forest Hercules with their disheveled heads, their sun-tanned chests, and their motionlessly hanging, strong-veined hands. What glances from untamed eyes, what distended nostrils, what iron muscles!"&lt;ref name="A252"&gt;Alpatov, 252&lt;/ref&gt; In his description of their heavy brows and the lined foreheads, Repin does not neglect their spiritual torment; although he does not concentrate too much on any single man's personal intimate emotions. Any sense of personal hardship is of secondary importance to the portrayal of effort and human dignity.&lt;ref name="A252" /&gt;

==Critical opinion, propaganda, and legacy==
Repin considered ''Barge Haulers'' to be his first professional painting and it is the work that defined him as a master documentarian of [[social inequality]].&lt;ref name="B114"&gt;Bolton, 114&lt;/ref&gt; When first exhibited, it received enthusiastic reviews for its unsentimental depiction of lower-class laborers, which stood in stark contrast to the romanticised, classical or propagandist nature of most contemporary Russian art.&lt;ref name="AM134" /&gt; The painting paved the way for Repin to join the [[Peredvizhniki]] (the ''Wanderers'' or ''Itinerants''), an anti-[[Academic art|academic]] realist movement formed in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~russ15/russia_PI/Russian_art.html Nineteenth-Century Russian Art: [[Ideological realism]]]". dartmouth.edu. Retrieved on 18 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Peredvizhniki sought not only to break away from the academic school, but also to subvert the manner in which art was viewed. By depicting scenes from ordinary life and holding exhibitions in the provinces they aimed to enlighten and make art more accessible to the masses.&lt;ref name="B114" /&gt;

The painting was widely discussed for its break with the traditions of the Academy. It earned Repin the respect of [[Vladimir Stasov]]&lt;ref name="AK" /&gt; who believed that art shaped people's outlook and the way in which they viewed their own political situation. Stasov encouraged Repin to focus on Russian subject matter and after the release of ''Barge Haulers,'' he became a close friend of the artist and enthusiastically praised each of Repin's paintings thereafter. Stasov wrote of the painting, "with a daring that is unprecedented amongst us [Repin] has abandoned all former conceptions of the ideal in art, and has plunged head first into the very heart of the people's life, the people's interests, and the people's oppressive reality... no one in Russia has ever dared take on such a subject".&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, 156&lt;/ref&gt;  In return, Repin said that Stasov's "cry all over Russia was the first and the mightiest and it was heard in Russia by everyone capable of hearing. It was thanks to him that my glory spread."&lt;ref&gt;Chandler, Josh. "[http://germslav.byu.edu/perspectives/2006/Chandler_Josh.pdf Vladimir Vasilievich Stasov and Soviet Socialist Realism]". germslav.byu.edu. Retrieved on 27 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:1875 bridgman scene de halage sur le nil 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frederick Arthur Bridgman]], ''Towing on the Nile'', 1875.]]
[[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] read about Repin's painting in the newspapers and assumed it was another Russian work whose artistry was secondary to its social message. He wrote, "Even the subject itself is terrible... I came expecting to see these barge-haulers all lined up in uniforms with the usual labels stuck to their foreheads... To my delight, all my fears turned out to be in vain... Not a single one of them shouts from the painting to the viewer, 'Look how unfortunate I am and how indebted you are to the people!'"&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Robin Feuer. ''Dostoevsky's unfinished journey.'' Yale University Press, 2007. 11. {{ISBN|0-300-12015-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; To Dostoyevsky, Repin had avoided a common fault of contemporary Russian art, and in doing so had heightened the work's impact. He concluded, "[I saw] barge haulers, real barge haulers, and nothing more... you can't help but think you are indebted, truly indebted, to the people."&lt;ref name="Frank111" /&gt; Such a feeling of an "unpaid debt" owed by the higher society to the peasantry was a common idea of the ''[[Narodniks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Parker Fran. "Russia on canvas: Ilya Repin". Pennsylvania State University Press, 1980. 26. {{ISBN|0-271-00252-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the painting is regarded as seminal in the formation of Russian realism.&lt;ref name="V208"&gt;Valkenier (1993), 208&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting has been criticised both for still bearing hallmarks of academic drawing and for having an overall yellowish tone.&lt;ref name="A252" /&gt; Although it won a prize at the Society for the Advancement of the Arts in 1872, Repin continued to rework the canvas until 1873 when it was exhibited at the Academy of Arts in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name="CA" /&gt;

The painting has been widely parodied, and it is often used as the basis for satirical political cartoons in Russia. A 1958 Finnish political cartoon based on the painting created an international hubbub in 1958 for showing [[Nikita Khrushchev]] on a barge pulled by [[Eastern bloc]] countries shouting "Imperialists!" to the US and UK on the shore.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kulttuuri/36729-tasta-suomalaiskuvasta-nousi-jattikohu-1958&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the art critic Elia Kabanov, Repin's painting influenced American orientalist painter [[Frederick Arthur Bridgman]] to produce his ''Towing on the Nile'' in 1875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://metkere.com/2011/03/bridgman.html | title=Бурлаки на Ниле | accessdate=9 March 2011 | author=Kabanov, Elia | year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provenance==
Despite its social realism, ''Barge Haulers'' was bought by the [[Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia|Tsar's second son]]. It was lent for exhibition at the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|1873 International Exhibition]] in Vienna, where it won a bronze medal. It was exhibited outside Russia again in 1878, when it was again widely praised by critics for marking a watershed in Russian art.&lt;ref name="V208" /&gt; After the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] the grand duke's art collection was [[nationalization|nationalize]]d and transferred from [[Vladimir Palace]] to the [[Russian Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://art.1september.ru/2003/22/no22_1.htm Государственный Русский музей]". art.1september.ru.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3478">'''Cognitive poetics''' is a school of [[literary]] criticism that applies the principles of [[cognitive science]], particularly [[cognitive psychology]], to the interpretation of literary [[Writing|texts]].  It has ties to [[reader-response criticism]], and is also closely related to [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]], whose application to literary study has been most popular in continental [[Europe]]. Like the [[New Critics]], cognitive poetics engages in close analysis of the text, but it recognizes that context has an important role to play in the creation of meaning.

Due to its focus on how readers process the language of texts, cognitive poetics represents simultaneously a turn back in time, to the [[ancient]] study of [[rhetoric]];&lt;ref name=Stockwell2002p8&gt;
"Cognitive poetics is still relatively new as a discipline, though it makes clear reconnections back to much older forms of analysis such as classical rhetoric."
Stockwell (2002): p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
but it also has a grounding in modern principles of [[cognitive linguistics]].

Topics addressed by cognitive poetics include [[deixis]]; text world theory (the feeling of immersion within texts); [[schema (psychology)|schema]], script, and their role in reading; attention; foregrounding; and [[genre]].

One of the main focal points of cognitive literary analysis is [[conceptual metaphor]], an idea pioneered and popularized by the works of [[George Lakoff|Lakoff]], as a tool for examining texts. Rather than regarding metaphors as ornamental [[figures of speech]], cognitive poetics examines how the conceptual bases of such metaphors interact with the text as a whole.

Prominent figures in the field include [[Reuven Tsur]], who is credited for originating the term,&lt;ref&gt;
"Reuven Tsur ... has run a cognitive poetics project since the early 1970s, long before the first publications in cognitive linguistics."
Gerard Steen and Joanna Gavins, "Contextualising cognitive poetics", in Gavins and Steen (2003): p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ronald Langacker]], [[Mark Turner (cognitive scientist)|Mark Turner]], Gerard Steen, Joanna Gavins and Peter Stockwell. Although Tsur's original, "precise and particular" sense of the term ''poetics'' was related to his theory of "[[poetry]] and [[perception]]", it has come to be "more broadly applied" to any "theory" or "system" of the workings (Greek ''poiesis'') of literature of any genre.&lt;ref name=Stockwell2002p8 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3500">The '''Community Arts Partnership''' (usually known as CAP) was established in 1990, and is the first program of its kind in the U.S. The program links the [[California Institute of the Arts]] (CalArts) to community art centers and public schools throughout Los Angeles County as part of an expanding joint endeavor to provide college-level arts education to middle and high school students. Glenna Avila currently serves as CAP's director.

It began in 1990 as a partnership between CalArts and three community arts centers: [[Plaza de la Raza]], the [[Watts Towers]] Arts Center and the [[Social and Public Art Resource Center]]. (SPARC)

CAP courses are taught by  CalArts faculty and students and are designed to mirror the [[pedagogical]] approaches used in teaching at CalArts. The different artistic disciplines being taught include [[art]], [[animation]], [[digital media]], [[dance]], [[drawing]], [[chamber music]], [[graphic design]], [[jazz]], [[printmaking]], [[photography]], [[public art]], [[puppetry]], [[theater]], [[video]], [[world music]] and [[writing]]. All CAP classes and workshops are offered free-of-charge and culminate in performances, exhibitions, concerts and screenings. To date, these public events have been held at more than 250 community venues throughout Los Angeles County, including the Roy and Edna Disney/CalArts Theater [[REDCAT]].

CAP forms a bridge between the talents and resources of CalArts and those of its community partners in order to train and encourage promising young artists. At the same time, CAP affords CalArts students the opportunity to share their knowledge and abilities with teenagers, work directly with faculty artists to create innovative educational approaches and test and refine ideas about interdisciplinary art practice. More than that, CalArts students involved in CAP gain valuable life, teaching and art making experience, and benefit from real-world engagement across a wide range of Los Angeles' unique communities.

CAP students who are admitted to CalArts after completing high school qualify for CAP scholarships.

Additionally, CAP creates model arts education curricula for middle and high schools. Designed to be responsive to the culturally diverse communities of Southern California, these curricula are based on the low student-teacher ratio of 4:1 and feature individualized arts training and mentoring.

Classes and workshops are taught at the following locations in Los Angeles County:
**Armory Center for the Arts
**Banning's Landing Community Center 
**Center for the Arts Eagle Rock 
**Inner-City Arts 
**KAOS Network 
**Los Angeles Center for Photographic Studies, 
**My Friend's Place 
**[[Plaza de la Raza]]
**[[San Fernando Gardens]] Community Service Center
**Santa Clarita Valley Boys &amp; Girls Club
**Santa Clarita Valley Youth Orchestra and 
**Art-in-the-Park  
**[[Self-Help Graphics &amp; Art]] 
**Side Street Projects 
**Taking the Reins
**Visual Communications
**William Reagh Los Angeles Photography Center
**Watts Towers Arts Center  
**Los Angeles Unified School District through CAP's ArtsCOOL program.

[[File:Commutativity of binary operations (without question mark).svg|thumb|An operation &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt; is commutative [[If and only if|iff]] &lt;math&gt;x\circ y = y \circ x&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;. This image illustrates this property with the concept of an operation as a "calculation machine". It doesn't matter for the output &lt;math&gt;x\circ y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;y \circ x&lt;/math&gt; respectively which order the arguments &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; have – the final outcome is the same.]]
In [[mathematics]], a [[binary operation]] is '''commutative''' if changing the order of the [[operand]]s does not change the result. It is a fundamental property of many [[binary operations]], and many [[mathematical proof]]s depend on it. Most familiar as the name of the property that says {{nowrap|1="3 + 4 = 4 + 3"}} or {{nowrap|1="2 × 5 = 5 × 2"}}, the property can also be used in more advanced settings. The name is needed because there are operations, such as  [[division (mathematics)|division]] and [[subtraction]], that do not have it (for example, {{nowrap|"3 − 5 ≠ 5 − 3"}}); such operations are ''not'' commutative, and so are referred to as ''noncommutative operations''. The idea that simple operations such as the [[multiplication (mathematics)|multiplication]] and [[addition]] of numbers are commutative, was for many years implicitly assumed. Thus, this property was not named until the 19th century, when mathematics started to become formalized.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A corresponding property exists for [[binary relation]]s; a binary relation is said to be [[symmetric relation|symmetric]] if the relation applies regardless of the order of its operands; for example, [[Equality (mathematics)|equality]] is symmetric as two equal mathematical objects are equal regardless of their order.&lt;ref&gt;{{MathWorld|id=SymmetricRelation|title=Symmetric Relation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common uses==
The ''commutative property'' (or ''commutative law'') is a property generally associated with binary operations and [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].  If the commutative property holds for a pair of elements under a certain binary operation then the two elements are said to ''commute'' under that operation.

==Mathematical definitions==
{{Further|Symmetric function}}
The term "commutative" is used in several related senses.&lt;ref name="Krowne, p.1"&gt;Krowne, p.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weisstein, ''Commute'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{ordered list|1=
A binary operation &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''S'' is called ''commutative'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;x * y = y * x\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y\in S&lt;/math&gt;

An operation that does not satisfy the above property is called ''non-commutative''.
|2=
One says that ''x commutes'' with ''y'' under &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; if:
:&lt;math&gt; x * y = y * x &lt;/math&gt;
|3=
A [[binary function]] &lt;math&gt;f \colon A \times A \to B&lt;/math&gt; is called ''commutative'' if:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = f(y, x)\qquad\mbox{for all }x,y\in A&lt;/math&gt;
}}

== Examples ==

===Commutative operations in everyday life===
[[File:Commutative Addition.svg|thumb|The cumulation of apples, which can be seen as an addition of natural numbers, is commutative.]]
*Putting on socks resembles a commutative operation since which sock is put on first is unimportant. Either way, the result (having both socks on), is the same. In contrast, putting on underwear and trousers is not commutative.
*The commutativity of addition is observed when paying for an item with cash.  Regardless of the order the bills are handed over in, they always give the same total.

===Commutative operations in mathematics===
[[File:Vector Addition.svg|thumb|The addition of vectors is commutative, because &lt;math&gt;\vec a+\vec b=\vec b+ \vec a&lt;/math&gt;.]]
Two well-known examples of commutative binary operations:&lt;ref name="Krowne, p.1"/&gt;
* The [[addition]] of [[real number]]s is commutative, since
::&lt;math&gt;y + z = z + y \qquad\mbox{for all }y,z\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:For example 4 + 5 = 5 + 4, since both [[Expression (mathematics)|expression]]s equal 9.
* The [[multiplication]] of [[real number]]s is commutative, since
::&lt;math&gt;y z = z y \qquad\mbox{for all }y,z\in \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:For example, 3 × 5 = 5 × 3, since both expressions equal 15.
* Some binary [[truth function]]s are also commutative, since the [[truth table]]s for the functions are the same when one changes the order of the operands. 
:For example, the [[logical biconditional]] function p ↔ q is equivalent to q ↔ p. This function is also written as p [[If and only if|IFF]] q, or as p ≡ q, or as E''pq''. 
:The last form is an example of the most concise notation in the article on truth functions, which lists the sixteen possible binary truth functions of which eight are commutative: V''pq'' = V''qp''; A''pq'' (OR) = A''qp''; D''pq'' (NAND) = D''qp''; E''pq'' (IFF) = E''qp''; J''pq'' = J''qp''; K''pq'' (AND) = K''qp''; X''pq'' (NOR) = X''qp''; O''pq'' = O''qp''.
* Further examples of commutative binary operations include addition and multiplication of [[complex number]]s, addition and [[scalar product|scalar multiplication]] of [[vector space|vectors]], and [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[Set (mathematics)|sets]].

===Noncommutative operations in daily life===

*[[Concatenation]], the act of joining character strings together, is a noncommutative operation. For example,
:{{nowrap|1=EA + T = EAT &amp;ne; TEA = T + EA}}
*Washing and drying clothes resembles a noncommutative operation; washing and then drying produces a markedly different result to drying and then washing.
*Rotating a book 90° around a vertical axis then 90° around a horizontal axis produces a different orientation than when the rotations are performed in the opposite order.
*The twists of the [[Rubik's Cube]] are noncommutative. This can be studied using [[group theory]].
*Thought processes are noncommutative: A person asked a question (A) and then a question (B) may give different answers to each question than a person asked first (B) and then (A), because asking a question may change the person's state of mind.
*The act of dressing is either commutative or non-commutative, depending on the items. Putting on underwear and normal clothing is noncommutative. Putting on left and right socks is commutative.

===Noncommutative operations in mathematics===
Some noncommutative binary operations:&lt;ref&gt;Yark, p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtraction and division====

[[Subtraction]] is noncommutative, since &lt;math&gt;0 - 1 \neq 1 - 0&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Division (mathematics)|Division]] is noncommutative, since &lt;math&gt;1 \div 2 \neq 2 \div 1&lt;/math&gt;.

====Truth functions====

Some [[truth function]]s are noncommutative, since the [[truth table]]s for the functions are different when one changes the order of the operands. For example, the truth tables for ''f'' (A, B) {{=}} A Λ ¬B (A AND NOT B) and ''f'' (B, A) {{=}} B Λ ¬A are
:{{aligned table
 | class=wikitable
 | style=text-align:center; width:20%;
 | cols=4
 | col3style=width:30%;
 | col4style=width:30%;
 | row1header=yes
 | A | B | ''f''&amp;nbsp;(A, B) | ''f''&amp;nbsp;(B, A)
 | F | F | F | F
 | F | T | F | T
 | T | F | T | F
 | T | T | F | F
 }}

For the eight noncommutative functions, B''qp'' = C''pq''; M''qp'' = L''pq''; C''qp'' = B''pq''; L''qp'' = M''pq''; F''qp'' = G''pq''; I''qp'' = H''pq''; G''qp'' = F''pq''; H''qp'' = I''pq''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jozef Maria Bochenski]] (1959), ''Precis of [[Mathematical Logic]]'', rev., Albert Menne, ed. and trans., Otto Bird, New York:  Gordon and Breach, Part II, Sec. 3.32, "16 dyadic truth functors", ([[truth tables]]), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Matrix multiplication====

[[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix]] multiplication is almost always noncommutative, for example:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 2 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} \neq
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} \cdot
  \begin{bmatrix}
    1 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix} =
  \begin{bmatrix}
    0 &amp; 1 \\
    0 &amp; 1
  \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Vector product====

The vector product (or [[cross product]]) of two vectors in three dimensions is [[anticommutativity|anti-commutative]]; i.e., ''b'' × ''a'' =  −(''a'' × ''b'').

==History and etymology==
[[File:Commutative Word Origin.PNG|right|thumb|250px|The first known use of the term was in a French Journal published in 1814]]

Records of the implicit use of the commutative property go back to ancient times.  The [[Egypt]]ians used the commutative property of [[multiplication]] to simplify computing [[Product (mathematics)|products]].&lt;ref&gt;Lumpkin, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay and Shute, p.?&lt;/ref&gt; [[Euclid]] is known to have assumed the commutative property of multiplication in his book [[Euclid's Elements|''Elements'']].&lt;ref&gt;O'Conner and Robertson, ''Real Numbers''&lt;/ref&gt;  Formal uses of the commutative property arose in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, when mathematicians began to work on a theory of functions.  Today the commutative property is a well-known and basic property used in most branches of mathematics.

The first recorded use of the term ''commutative'' was in a memoir by [[François-Joseph Servois|François Servois]] in 1814,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Cabillón and Miller, ''Commutative and Distributive''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O'Conner and Robertson, ''Servois''&lt;/ref&gt; which used the word ''commutatives'' when describing functions that have what is now called the commutative property.  The word is a combination of the French word ''commuter'' meaning "to substitute or switch" and the suffix ''-ative'' meaning "tending to" so the word literally means "tending to substitute or switch."  The term then appeared in English in 1838&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mathematics in Victorian Britain|editor1-first=Raymond|editor1-last=Flood|editor2-first=Adrian|editor2-last=Rice|editor3-first=Robin|editor3-last=Wilson|editor3-link=Robin Wilson (mathematician)|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YruifIx88AQC&amp;pg=PA4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Duncan Farquharson Gregory]]'s article entitled "On the real nature of symbolical algebra" published in 1840 in the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=D. F. Gregory|title=On the real nature of symbolical algebra|periodical=Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|volume=14|pages=208–216|year=1840|url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsofro14royal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Propositional logic ==
{{Transformation rules}}

=== Rule of replacement ===
In truth-functional propositional logic, ''commutation'',&lt;ref&gt;Moore and Parker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Copi |first=Irving M. |last2=Cohen |first2=Carl |title=Introduction to Logic |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''commutativity''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Concise Introduction to Logic 4th edition |last=Hurley |first=Patrick  |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Wadsworth Publishing }}&lt;/ref&gt; refer to two [[Validity (logic)|valid]] [[rule of replacement|rules of replacement]]. The rules allow one to transpose [[propositional variable]]s within [[well-formed formula|logical expressions]] in [[formal proof|logical proofs]]. The rules are:

:&lt;math&gt;(P \lor Q) \Leftrightarrow (Q \lor P)&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \Leftrightarrow (Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;

where "&lt;math&gt;\Leftrightarrow&lt;/math&gt;" is a [[metalogic]]al [[Symbol (formal)|symbol]] representing "can be replaced in a [[Formal proof|proof]] with."

=== Truth functional connectives ===

''Commutativity'' is a property of some [[logical connective]]s of truth functional [[propositional logic]]. The following [[logical equivalence]]s demonstrate that commutativity is a property of particular connectives. The following are truth-functional [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

;Commutativity of conjunction:&lt;math&gt;(P \land Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \land P)&lt;/math&gt;
;Commutativity of disjunction:&lt;math&gt;(P \lor Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \lor P)&lt;/math&gt;
;Commutativity of implication (also called the law of permutation):&lt;math&gt;(P \to (Q \to R)) \leftrightarrow (Q \to (P \to R))&lt;/math&gt;
;Commutativity of equivalence (also called the complete commutative law of equivalence):&lt;math&gt;(P \leftrightarrow Q) \leftrightarrow (Q \leftrightarrow P)&lt;/math&gt;

== Set theory ==
In [[group theory|group]] and [[set theory]], many algebraic structures are called commutative when certain operands satisfy the commutative property.  In higher branches of mathematics, such as [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]] and [[linear algebra]] the commutativity of well-known operations (such as [[addition]] and [[multiplication]] on real and complex numbers) is often used (or implicitly assumed) in proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Axler, p.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallian, p.34"&gt;Gallian, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;p. 26,87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical structures and commutativity==
* A [[commutative semigroup]] is a set endowed with a total, [[associativity|associative]] and commutative operation.
* If the operation additionally has an [[identity element]], we have a [[commutative monoid]]
* An [[abelian group]], or ''commutative group'' is a [[group (mathematics)|group]] whose group operation is commutative.&lt;ref name="Gallian, p.34"/&gt;
* A [[commutative ring]] is a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] whose [[multiplication]] is commutative. (Addition in a ring is always commutative.)&lt;ref&gt;Gallian p.236&lt;/ref&gt;
* In a [[field (mathematics)|field]] both addition and multiplication are commutative.&lt;ref&gt;Gallian p.250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related properties==

===Associativity===
{{Main|Associative property}}

The associative property is closely related to the commutative property.  The associative property of an expression containing two or more occurrences of the same operator states that the order operations are performed in does not affect the final result, as long as the order of terms doesn't change. In contrast, the commutative property states that the order of the terms does not affect the final result.

Most commutative operations encountered in practice are also associative. However, commutativity does not imply associativity. A counterexample is the function

:&lt;math&gt;f(x, y) = \frac{x + y}{2},&lt;/math&gt;

which is clearly commutative (interchanging ''x'' and ''y'' does not affect the result), but it is not associative (since, for example, &lt;math&gt;f(-4, f(0, +4)) = -1&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;f(f(-4, 0), +4) = +1&lt;/math&gt;).
More such examples may be found in [[commutative non-associative magmas]].

===Distributive===
{{Main|Distributive property}}

===Symmetry===
[[File:Symmetry Of Addition.svg|right|thumb|200px|Graph showing the symmetry of the addition function]]
{{Main|Symmetry in mathematics}}

Some forms of symmetry can be directly linked to commutativity.  When a commutative operator is written as a binary function then the resulting function is symmetric across the line ''y = x''.  As an example, if we let a function ''f'' represent addition (a commutative operation) so that ''f''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' + ''y'' then ''f'' is a symmetric function, which can be seen in the adjacent image.

For relations, a [[symmetric relation]] is analogous to a commutative operation, in that if a relation ''R'' is symmetric, then &lt;math&gt;a R b \Leftrightarrow b R a&lt;/math&gt;.

==Non-commuting operators in quantum mechanics==
{{Main|Canonical commutation relation}}

In [[Introduction to quantum mechanics|quantum mechanics]] as formulated by [[Erwin Schrödinger|Schrödinger]], physical variables are represented by [[linear operators]] such as ''x'' (meaning multiply by ''x''), and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;. These two operators do not commute as may be seen by considering the effect of their [[Function composition|compositions]] &lt;math&gt;x \frac{d}{dx}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} x&lt;/math&gt; (also called products of operators) on a one-dimensional [[wave function]] &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt; x\cdot {\mathrm{d}\over \mathrm{d}x}\psi = x\cdot \psi' \ \neq \ \psi + x\cdot \psi' = {\mathrm{d}\over \mathrm{d}x}\left( x\cdot \psi \right) &lt;/math&gt;

According to the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]], if the two operators representing a pair of variables do not commute, then that pair of variables are mutually [[complementarity (physics)|complementary]], which means they cannot be simultaneously measured or known precisely. For example, the position and the linear [[momentum]] in the ''x''-direction of a particle are represented by the operators &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial x}&lt;/math&gt;, respectively (where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]). This is the same example except for the constant &lt;math&gt;-i \hbar&lt;/math&gt;, so again the operators do not commute and the physical meaning is that the position and linear momentum in a given direction are complementary.

'''''Contre Sainte-Beuve''''' ({{IPA-fr|kɔ̃tʁ sɛ̃t bœv|lang}}, "Against [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]]") is an unfinished book of essays written by [[Marcel Proust]] between 1895 and 1900 and first published posthumously in 1954. The book was discovered, with its pages in order, amongst Proust's papers after his death. It consists of several essays, three of which refute the body of work written by [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve]], a French literary critic active in the early to mid-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://modernism.research.yale.edu/wiki/index.php/Contre_Saint-Beuve|title=Contre Saint-Beuve|last=Shapiro|first=Michael|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''creative industry in Brazil''' refers to various economic sectors of [[Brazil]] that depend on the talents and creativity to develop.&lt;ref name="UOL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.uol.com.br/noticias/redacao/2013/02/07/conheca-a-economia-criativa-e-veja-5-dicas-para-empreender-na-area.htm|title=Conheça a economia criativa e veja 5 dicas para empreender na área|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Coldibeli, Larissa - UOL Economia (07/02/2013)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is about generating [[wealth]] for the region through [[knowledge]], [[culture]] and [[creativity]], in order to contribute to [[sustainable development]] (environmental, economic and social).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redeglobo.globo.com/globocidadania/videos/t/globo-ecologia/v/economia-criativa-cultura-e-sustentabilidade-integra/2473289/|title=Brasil possui imenso potencial no mercado da economia criativa (in ''Globo Ecologia'')|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Rede Globo de Televisão (14/07/2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '[[creative industries]]' was coined by the [[United Kingdom]] in 1990 and in 2001 won two updates: one by researcher [[John Howkins]], which gave it an entrepreneurial vision when focusing on the transformation of creativity in product;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;To do so, he based on "the [[marketing]] concepts of [[intellectual property]]" applied to [[trademarks]], [[patents]] and [[copyrights]].&lt;/ref&gt; and another one by professor [[Richard Florida]], which focused on professionals involved in the creative processes of production, addressing the social aspects and the "potential contribution to the development" of the "[[creative class]]". The first study of international coverage only emerged in 2008 - conducted by the [[United Nations Conference on Trade and Development]] (UNCTAD) - the same year it was published another study on the subject, only fully about Brazil.&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt;

== Creative professions ==

Based on the ''Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações - CBO'' (read "Brazilian Classification of Occupations"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtecbo.gov.br/cbosite/pages/pesquisas/BuscaPorTitulo.jsf|title=Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações|accessdate=16 December 2013|website=Ministério do Trabalho e Emprego}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Ministry of Labour and Employment's list of all professions in the country,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It was last updated on 2002 due to the new classification methodology, as explained on page [http://www.mtecbo.gov.br/cbosite/pages/saibaMais.jsf "CBO - Classificação Brasileira de Ocupações"].&lt;/ref&gt; the creative work market was mapped. The result of the study listed fourteen creative professions,&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt; in which [[knowledge]] is a transforming input of production:
# [[Architecture]] and [[Engineering]]; 
# [[Art]]; 
# [[Performing arts|Performing Arts]]; 
# [[Biotechnology]]; 
# [[Design]]; 
# Cultural expressions; 
# [[Professional audiovisual industry|Film &amp; Video]]; 
# [[Publishing|Editorial Market]]; 
# [[Fashion]]; 
# [[Music]]; 
# [[Research and development]]; 
# [[Advertising]]; 
# [[Software]], [[Computer]] &amp; [[Telecommunications|Telecom]]; 
# [[Television]] &amp; [[Radio]].

== History ==

The first initiative to map the [[creative industries]] from any country was from the United Kingdom&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The document´s name is “Creative Industries Mapping Documents”, released in 1998 by the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]] in the UK.&lt;/ref&gt; at the end of 1990. The goal was to prove that these sectors have an important role to the [[culture]] and the potential to generate jobs and wealth to the country. Then, these creative industries were mapped, and all others who maintained relations with them as well. Thus, it was built a view of the weight of the creative chains in the production process.

Three years after this pioneering work, specifically in 2001, two others arose:

* One from researcher [[John Howkins]], who built his study according to a corporate vision (based on marketing concepts of [[intellectual property]]); 
* And another one from teacher [[Richard Florida]], which showed off the so-called "creative class" (professionals who work with creative processes).

It did not take long for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD, 2008) to launch another study on the subject, only this time with an international scope. According to the survey, the [[exports]] of the creative industries in the world exceeded 500 billion dollars.&lt;ref name="Unctad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unctad.org/en/Docs/ditc20082cer_en.pdf|title=Creative Economy Report 2008: the challenge of assessing the creative economy (PDF - 2,54 MB)|accessdate=26 March 2014|date=2008|website=Unctad}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Given the importance of the issue to the world and specifically to Brazil, the study ''A Cadeia da Indústria Criativa no Brasil'' (read "The Chain of Creative Industry in Brazil"), was undertaken. It was updated in 2011 and published in 2012.&lt;ref name="MIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firjan.org.br/economiacriativa/download/Analise_completa.pdf|title=Indústria Criativa - Mapeamento da Indústria Criativa no Brasil (PDF - 1,85 MB)|accessdate=16 December 2013|website=FIRJAN, Sistema (2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This tool to map the creative industry in the country is able to list information about each of these professions, such as the amount of [[job]]s, [[wages]] and the education level required. Thus, it unites information from both the ''Classificação Nacional de Atividades Econômicas'' (i.e. "National Classification of Economic Activities") and the "Brazilian Classification of Occupations".

In general, the creative industries encompass "[[economic activity]] directly related to the art world - especially the visual arts, performing arts, literature and publishing, photography, crafts, libraries, museums, galleries, archives, spots designated by the [[National Historic Landmark]] and festivals of arts (...) electronic media and other recent media (...) design-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economiacriativa.com/ec/pt/ec/evolucao.asp|title=A evolução do conceito de "Indústrias Criativas" no tempo|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme is sometimes confused with the term "[[culture industry]]". However, "the scope of the creative economy is determined by the extent of the creative industries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cultura.gov.br/economiacriativa/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/relatorioUNCTAD2010Port.pdf|title=Relatório de Economia Criativa 2010 (PDF)|accessdate=14 April 2014|website=Nações Unidas}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, cultural products and services would be part of a larger category of creative products and services.

== Chain ==

For the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the chain of creative industry comprises the "cycles of creation, production and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] of [[goods and services]] that use creativity and [[intellectual capital]] as primary inputs."&lt;ref name="Unctad"/&gt; Thus, it can be divided into three major areas: creative core (the creative economic activities) related activities (provide goods and services directly to the core) and support (provide goods and services indirectly to the core).

The United Kingdom's [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] considers as creative industries activities "that have their origin in creativity, skill and individual talent and which have a potential for creating wealth and jobs through the generation and exploitation of intellectual property." Based on this concept, it can be said that Brazil is very important when it comes to creative industry. After all, he is one of the largest producers in the world of creativity. Analyzing the remuneration of the Brazilian people, it was found that the wages of those working in the creative industry in Brazil are almost three times higher than the national average wage (comparison value: R$4,693 and R$1,733, respectively). And among creative professionals, those from Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo and the Federal District receive the best salaries. These are data from the "Creative Industries Mapping",&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt; which was based on information from 2011. The study addresses issues such as jobs, wages, average wage per state, number of employees by segment and even from the [[GDP]] creative country.

== Acknowledgement ==

The sector has gained so much importance that, in May 2012, the Brazilian president [[Dilma Rousseff]] decreed the creation of the ''Secretaria da Economia Criativa'' ("Creative Economy Secretariat").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2011-2014/2012/Decreto/D7743.htm|title=Decreto Nº 7.743, de 31 de maio de 2012|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Presidência da República do Brasil (31/05/2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of SEC is to create, implement and monitor [[public policy]] that have the culture as a strategic axis, "prioritizing support and encouragement to professionals and to the micro and small Brazilian creative endeavors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cultura.gov.br/site/categoria/politicas/economia-criativa-2/|title=Economia Criativa|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Ministério da Cultura do Brasil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report from the [[United Nations]], Brazil is not among the top twenty producers in the industry yet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasileconomico.epaper.grupodia.com.br/contents/BE_2011-12-05.pdf|title=Brasil avança em criatividade|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Brasil Econômico (05/12/2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the initiative of creating the SEC indicated the government's desire to reposition the "culture as development axis of the Brazilian state."&lt;ref name="SEC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://brasileconomico.epaper.grupodia.com.br/contents/BE_2011-12-05.pdf|title=Planejando um Brasil criativo|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Brasil Econômico (05/12/2011)}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the President of the [[National Bank for Economic and Social Development]] (BNDES), [[Luciano Coutinho]], this is a recognition that creative activities are important for the country "in a long-term perspective, having as a goal a more inclusive and sustainable development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cultura.gov.br/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Plano-da-Secretaria-da-Economia-Criativa.pdf|title=Economia criativa para o desenvolvimento (in ''Plano da Secretaria da Economia Criativa'')|website=Ministério da Cultura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally, the countries that have excelled in the industry are [[China]], in the first place, followed by the [[United States]] and [[Germany]]. But Brazil has contributed greatly in the fields of architecture, fashion and design, revealing its creative potential worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globotv.globo.com/rede-globo/globo-ecologia/v/brasil-possui-imenso-potencial-no-mercado-da-economia-criativa/2473267/|title=Economia criativa:cultura e sustentabilidade (in ''Globo Ecologia'')|accessdate=15 April 2014|website=Rede Globo de Televisão (14/07/2012)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brazilian x-ray ==

The creative industry in Brazil gathers, generally, "young, educated and well-paid professionals" that earn 42% above the average wage in the country.&lt;ref name="UOL"/&gt; It is difficult to know how much an idea or innovation costs, once they are [[intangible assets]]. One way of finding that out would be to create metrics and to use qualitative and quantitative researches. What is possible to identify are general economic data related to the Creative Industry in Brazil, such as:&lt;ref name="MIC"/&gt;

* '''''Share of GDP''''': R$110 billion
* '''''Enterprises''''': 243 thousand
* '''''Professionals''''': 810 thousand, of which the most numerous are:
# [[Architects]] and [[engineer]]s: 229 877 [[employee]]s formal; 
# [[Programmer]]s information systems: 50,440; 
# [[Business analyst]]s: 45,324; 
# Research and market analyst: 25,141; 
# [[Marketing manager]]: 20,382; 
# [[Advertising agents]]: 14,032; 
# [[Graphic Designer]]: 17,806; 
# [[Biologist]]: 15,182; 
# Manager of research and development: 13,414; 
# Designer of bespoke shoes: 13,068. 
*'''''Wages''''': the best paid creative activities are: 
# [[Geologists]] and [[geophysical]]s: R$11,385; 
# Directors of [[TV shows]]: R$10,753; 
# [[Actor]]s: R$10,348; 
# [[Biotechnologist]]s: R$8,701; 
# News room directors: R$7,774; 
# [[Magazine]] editors: R$7,594; 
# [[Architect]]s and [[engineer]]s: R$7,524; 
# [[Electrical Engineer]]s, [[electronics engineer]]s and [[Computer engineer]]s: R$7,431; 
# [[Screenwriter]]s: R$7,347; 
# [[Researcher]]s in general: R$7,102.
According to the Creative Economy Secretary of the [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Ministry of Culture]], Cláudia Leitão, the country is learning to grow in this area, transforming the "Brazilian creativity into innovation and innovation into wealth."&lt;ref name="SEC"/&gt;

[[File:CriticalEssaysOrwell.jpg|thumb|First edition (publ. [[Secker &amp; Warburg]])]]
'''''Critical Essays''''' (1946) is a collection of wartime pieces by [[George Orwell]].  It covers a variety of topics in English literature, and also includes some pioneering studies of [[popular culture]].  It was acclaimed by critics, and Orwell himself thought it one of his most important books.

== Publication ==

In late 1944 Orwell, worrying about the ephemerality of magazine publication, began to collect a volume of his best essays.{{sfn|Rodden|Rossi|2012|p=70}}  The resulting collection appeared under the imprint of [[Harvill Secker|Secker &amp; Warburg]] on 14 February 1946, with a print-run of 3028 copies.  The following May a second impression of 5632 copies was issued, with some small corrections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Peter |editor1-last=Davison |editor1-link=Peter Davison (professor) |title=Smothered Under Journalism: 1946 |accessdate=4 October 2013 |series=The Complete Works of George Orwell.

== Themes ==

The [[blurb]] to the first edition described some of the essays as being "among the very few attempts that have been made in England to study popular art seriously".  Orwell thought seemingly frivolous popular culture, such as crime fiction, [[Postcard#British seaside postcards|comic postcards]], and the [[Billy Bunter]] stories, to be worth studying for the light it throws on contemporary attitudes.{{sfn|Crick|1994}}  Applying this approach to the subjects considered in ''Critical Essays'' he tended to find that they showed the innovations of his own time to be harsh and unfeeling compared to the old-fashioned humanity of traditional popular forms.{{sfn|Meyers|1997|p=22}}
Another theme is that of literary style, which Orwell thought to be the inevitable result of its writer's world-view and the message he wanted to get across.  He considered the English language of the 1940s to be in a degenerate state, and held that political discourse was inevitably corrupted as a result.{{sfn|Crick|1994}}{{sfn|Rodden|Rossi|2012|p=70}}

== Critical reception ==

Orwell himself, writing before he had completed ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', said that he thought ''Critical Essays'' one of his three most important books, along with ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]''.{{sfn|Rodden|Rossi|2012|p=70}}  His contemporaries in the world of criticism also largely saw the book's merits.  The journalist [[T. R. Fyvel|Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'', acclaimed Orwell as "a national figure as a critic, satirist and political journalist", while disagreeing with Orwell's view that the [[Attlee ministry|Attlee government]] was uncommitted to the introduction a fully socialist society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rodden |first1=John |title=George Orwell: The Politics of Literary Reputation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-7ihMZgiRgC&amp;pg=PA307 |accessdate=6 October 2012 |year=2009 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Transaction |location=New Brunswick, N.J. |isbn=076580896X |page=307 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Catholic paper ''[[The Tablet]]'' [[Evelyn Waugh]] predictably deplored Orwell's lack of religious feeling, but also wrote that the essays "represent at its best the new humanism of the common man", and that Orwell was "outstandingly the wisest" of the new critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Giraldi |first1=William |date=11 August 2013 |title=Orwell: Sage of the Century |journal=New Republic |url=https://newrepublic.com/article/114254/george-orwell-life-letters-reviewed-william-giraldi |accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greene |first1=Donald |author1-link=Donald Greene |chapter=Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh – "Catholic novelists" |editor1-last=Meyers |editor1-first=Jeffrey |title=Graham Greene: A Revaluation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MbdaAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22orwell+is+outstandingly+the+wisest%22&amp;dq=%22orwell+is+outstandingly+the+wisest%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hWJ2UpHwHo2AhQe6kICwBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |publication-date=1990 |page=23 |isbn=0333458958 |accessdate=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Middleton Murry|Middleton Murry]], who likewise criticised Orwell's secularism, nevertheless called Orwell and [[Cyril Connolly]] the two most gifted critics of their generation.  [[V. S. Pritchett]] considered the essays "brilliant examples of political anthropology applied to literature by a non-conforming mind".  [[Eric Bentley]] saw the book as "a dirge for nineteenth-century liberalism", and, like [[Irving Howe]], thought it represented Orwell at his best.{{sfn|Meyers|1997|pp=23, 220}}  [[Edmund Wilson]], a critic to whom most others compared Orwell, called him "the only contemporary master" of sociological criticism, praising him for his courage in rejecting the reigning orthodoxies, and for "a prose style that is both downright and disciplined".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Meyers |first1=Jeffrey |title=Edmund Wilson: A Biography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6bhdAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA272 |location=London |publisher=Constable |publication-date=1995 |pages=272–273 |isbn=0395689937 |accessdate=3 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent survey of Orwell's work endorses his own high opinion of its importance, calling it "Orwell at his best", a book which "showed Orwell's talent for finding deep meaning in otherwise trivial matters",{{sfn|Rodden|Rossi|2012|p=70}} while [[Bernard Crick]] said that Orwell's essays "may well constitute his lasting claim to greatness as a writer".{{sfn|Crick|1994}}

'''''Denzel Washington Is The Greatest Actor Of All Time Period''''', sometimes abbreviated to '''''DWITGAOATP''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://denzelisthegreatest.tumblr.com/|title=DWITGAOATP!|website=denzelisthegreatest.tumblr.com|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://store.earwolf.com/store/apparel/7575/denzel-washington-is-the-greatest-actor-of-all-time-period-t-shirt|title=Denzel Washington is The Greatest Actor of All Time Period T-Shirt - Earwolf|website=Earwolf|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a weekly [[podcast]] co-hosted by [[W. Kamau Bell]] and [[Kevin Avery (comedian)|Kevin Avery]]. Designed to highlight and [[Canonization|canonize]] the career and cultural significance of actor [[Denzel Washington]], the show reviews each of his films, discusses "Denzel news," and interviews filmmakers associated with and inspired by his work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earwolf.com/show/denzel-washington|title=Denzel Washington Is The Greatest Actor Of All Time Period podcast on Earwolf|website=www.earwolf.com|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/but-is-denzel-washington-the-greatest-actor-of-all-time-period-6617837|title=But IS Denzel Washington the Greatest Actor of All Time, Period?|last=Cowell|first=Tom|date=2015-05-06|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the show has evolved, it has also expanded to include discussions on the state of black film and diversity in media. The show is produced by [[Earwolf]].

== Background ==
Co-hosts Avery and Bell first met as stand-up comics in the San Francisco Bay Area, and Avery would later serve as the head writer for ''[[Totally Biased with W. Kamau Bell]]''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fastcocreate.com/3047220/w-kamau-bell-on-podcasting-betting-on-yourself-and-comedy-as-a-life-processor|title=W. Kamau Bell On Podcasting, Denzel, And The Wisdom Of Betting On Yourself|date=2015-06-30|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kevinaverycomedy.com/biography/|title=About Kevin Avery «  Kevin Avery|website=www.kevinaverycomedy.com|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had frequently connected over their shared fandom of Denzel Washington films, which led to the concept of the podcast being created when both comedians were searching for new projects after the cancelation of ''Totally Biased''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/entertainment/interviews/a34700/w-kamau-bell-interview/|title=W. Kamau Bell on Why Denzel Washington Is the Greatest|date=2015-04-30|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bell explained the motivation for creating the podcast as follows:
{{Pull quote|text=I think the great thing about this podcast is, even if people don't think he's the greatest actor of all time—first of all, they'd be wrong—you'd totally get why somebody would be excited about Denzel Washington. He's like black Santa Claus, like he'd walk into the room and everybody gets excited. He's just one of those dudes. There are other actors like that, but I think as a black actor, it says something more about him and his place in history. And, also, he's very aware of his place in history. So, I think that's the other thing, too. He's an actor who's aware that he's a part of the history of black Hollywood, and he has to take care of his place, because who knows who's coming after him?|source="W. Kamau Bell on Baltimore, Ferguson, and Why Denzel Washington Is the Greatest", ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', April 30, 2015&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;}}The first episode of the show was released on November 2, 2014, and new episodes are generally released on Thursdays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://howl.fm/audio/playlists/4345/denzel-washington-is-the-greatest-actor-of-all-time-period|title=Denzel Washington is The Greatest Actor of All Time Period - Howl|website=Howl|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial goal was to review Washington's films in mostly alphabetical order, although in practice guest hosts and topical conversations have resulted in that order being changed many times.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wkamaubell.com/denzel-washington/|title=Denzel Washington...|website=W. Kamau Bell|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond focusing on Washington's career alone, the podcast has also expanded to include discussions on the role of black actors and filmmakers in Hollywood and in media in general. Bell explained in an interview how the premise of the show connects with this added focus: "There's stuff about how hard it is to be a working black actress in Hollywood, because you see [Denzel] and where are all these black actresses that you see in one movie? Why aren't they working more? So we end up bleeding into other issues."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Format ==

=== Reviews and ratings ===
Bell, Avery, and guest hosts all provide a rating on a 1 to 5 [[Star (classification)|star-rating scale]] for each film reviewed. The ratings system is based on a speech from the movie ''Malcolm X'', as follows: "Been Took" (1), "Led Astray" (2), "Hoodwinked" (3), "Run Amok" (4), and "Bamboozled" (5).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://denzealots.com/rating-system|title=Denzealots - Rating System|website=denzealots.com|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, a 6-star rating of "This is what he does!", created based on a fan suggestion, is also given.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/wkamaubell/status/571392860441874435|title=W.

=== Interviews and guests ===
The show has featured several comedians, actors, and filmmakers as guest hosts. It also features interviews with actors and filmmakers who have collaborated with Washington as well as other notable figures in black film and media. Guests are generally asked to list their top 5 favorite Denzel Washington films, in order. A guest choosing more than five films for their list known as "Cooglering", as guest [[Ryan Coogler]] did so by including multiple films tied for one spot.

== Recurring themes and lore ==

=== Denzelishness ===
Some of the common characteristics and features of Denzel Washington characters are described in the podcast as components of "Denzelishness." These include: the Denzel walk ("sideways stroll with the confidence of a man who just had a shot of tequila"), Denzel humor, the Denzel lip, unaffected badassery, and the [[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]] tear (referring to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD5DVxqmjRo an iconic scene] where Washington's character cries a single tear in that film).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-hershon/podcast-review-denzel-was_b_6160882.html|title=Podcast Review: Denzel Washington is the Greatest Actor of All Time PERIOD|last=Hershon|first=Marc|date=2014-11-14|website=The Huffington Post|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Periodization of Washington's career ===
In the show, Avery and Bell periodize Washington's films into four distinct phases: the ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' Era, the ''[[He Got Game]]'' Era, the ''[[Man on Fire (2004 film)|Man on Fire]]'' Era, and the Old Man Action Era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.workofwrestling.com/artsetc/denzel-washington-is-the-greatest-actor-of-all-time-period|title=THE MUSEUM OF DENZELISHNESS: EXAMINING #DWITGAOATP|access-date=2016-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter is the current era of his filmography, and includes such films as ''[[The Taking of Pelham 123 (2009 film)|The Taking of Pelham 123]]'' (2009), ''[[The Book of Life (2014 film)|The Book of Eli]]'' (2010), ''[[Safe House (2012 film)|Safe House]]'' (2012), and ''[[The Equalizer (film)|The Equalizer]]'' (2014).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2326">'''Dialogue''', in fiction, is a verbal exchange between two or more characters. If there is only ''one'' character talking aloud, it is a [[monologue]].

==Identifiers==
''"This breakfast is making me sick," George said.''

The ''George said'' is the identifier. ''Said'' is the [[verb]] most writers use because reader familiarity with ''said'' prevents it from drawing attention to itself. Although other verbs such as ''ask'', ''shout'', or ''reply'' are acceptable, some identifiers get in the reader's way. For example:

''"Hello," he croaked nervously, "my name's Horace."''&lt;br&gt;
''"What's yours?" he asked with as much aplomb as he could muster.''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Turco|1989|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
another example is:
"My name is Peg, what's yours?" I asked.
"My name is William, but my friends call me Will," said Will.

[[Stephen King]], in his book ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'', expresses his belief that ''said'' is the best identifier to use. King recommends reading a novel by [[Larry McMurtry]], who he claims has mastered the art of well-written dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|King|2000|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Substitutes are known as ''said-bookisms''. For example, in the sentence ''"What do you mean?" he smiled.'', the word ''smiled'' is a said-bookism.

'''''Déficit''''' is a 2007 [[Mexico|Mexican]] feature film, the debut of [[Gael García Bernal]] as a [[film director|director]]. It was written by Kyzza Terrazas and debuted at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] on May 21, 2007.

In the film the lives of the rich Cristobal and his sister are contrasted with those of the servants on the estate. However, the riches are from illegal sources it would seem, and his father is on the run in Europe. In particular it is made clear that his childhood friend Adan, is now firmly kept in his place as the family gardener, and is no longer treated as a friend.

==Plot==
It tells the story of a rich young man, Cristobal, and his friends throwing a [[house party]] over the course of a weekend at his parents' home in [[Tepoztlán]]. It is implied through murmurings that his father is in [[Europe]] trying to settle finances and avoid corruption charges. At the beginning of the film, he is driven to the house by one of his [[Indigenous peoples in Mexico|Indian]] servants. They drive through a group of protesters without ever really wondering what they are protesting about. His hippie sister, Elisa, has already invaded the place with her drug-addled friends hailing from places such as [[Brazil]] and [[Japan]]. The two groups seem disparate but it's nothing that can't be resolved through sharing alcohol and [[marijuana]]. Already at the house is a family who work as the groundskeepers and Adan, also a twenty-something who has grown up with them but works for them, creating an uncomfortable atmosphere as Cristobal barks out orders.

Cristobal and Adan vie for the attention of Dolores, an [[Argentina|Argentine]] girl at the party whose family has also escaped Argentina due to financial problems. Cris also struggles with his girlfriend, Mafer, constantly phoning him and finding out that he didn't get into [[Harvard University]], where his father wanted him to go. When he finds out that Adan did get into a university in the [[United States]], their rivalry grows even greater. During a [[Football (soccer)|football]] match in the garden, Cris purposely fouls Adan, showing his bitterness.

Cris and Dolores grow close and begin kissing, only to be interrupted by one of Mafer's phone calls. That night, a [[rave]] is held. Elisa, on an [[MDMA|ecstasy]] trip, wanders into the garden and finds Adan sitting in a tree on the perimeter, as he had returned to observe their antics after he had already left. She kisses him, but then begins to [[Drug overdose|overdose]]. She calls for Cristobal and he takes her into the house and blames Adan for what has happened. Cristobel starts a fight with Adan but is overpowered, and in frustration calls Adan an Indio, as a derogatory, deeply hurting Adan and reinforcing their differences. Elisa insists that he should not take her to a hospital. He finds she has been given three pills by one of the boys and the guests are asked to leave. Mafer then turns up, furious that he has been flirting with other women while she was trying to get to the party (Cris having ignored her phone call asking to come and pick her up). Cris receives a mobile phone call, which he can see is from his father, but he doesn't answer it and bursts into tears. The day saw him rejected from Harvard, lose his girlfriend (and Dolores) and his sister overdose on ecstasy, with the rift from his parents firmly entrenched and the differences between Adan perceived

'''''Encyclopedia of Aesthetics''''', published in 1998 by [[Oxford University Press]], is an [[encyclopedia]] that covers philosophical, historical, sociological, and biographical aspects of Art and [[Aesthetics]] worldwide.

==Information==
Many prominent aesthetics scholars contributed.&lt;ref name="Silvers"&gt;Silvers (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The encyclopedia aimed to provide "a genealogy of aesthetics sufficient to integrate its philosophical and cultural roles, and that it contributes to a discursive public sphere in which multiple perspectives are articulated, dialogue fostered, and common ground constructed."&lt;ref name="Silvers"/&gt;

The Encyclopedia of Aesthetics is considered to be the first reference work to survey artistic theory and art history from classical philosophy to contemporary critical theory, featuring over 600 articles that focus on many topics of art history including painting, sculpture, and the artistic and cultural aesthetics of world nations.&lt;ref&gt;"Oxford-Reference"&lt;/ref&gt;

The only comparable work is 25 years older: ''The Dictionary of the History of Ideas: Studies of Selected Pivotal Ideas'' (New York, NY: Scribner, 1973–74), which had articles on aesthetics and other key topics, written from an interdisciplinary approach.&lt;ref name="Riedel"&gt;Review by Tom Riedel&lt;/ref&gt; There are other contemporary works that deal with the aesthetics universe, but "from within their respective disciplinary frameworks";&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt; they are: ''The Dictionary of Art'' (New York, NY: Grove’s Dictionaries, 1996) and ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (London, England: Routledge, 1998).

The Encyclopedia was written from a comparative perspective, with the traditions of non western societies in view, and re-thought the critical assumptions of western aesthetics.&lt;ref name="Patella"&gt;Review by Giuseppe Patella&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of such perspective are the entries: [[grotesque]]; [[Black Aesthetic]], [[African Aesthetics]], [[Caribbean Aesthetics]], [[Chinese Aesthetics]], [[Indian Aesthetics]], [[Japanese Aesthetics]], [[Islamic Aesthetics]], [[Latin American Aesthetics]]; [[Tribal art]];&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]] ''[http://www.denisdutton.com/tribal_art.htm Tribal Art]'' in ''Encyclopedia of Aesthetics'', edited by Michael Kelly (New York: Oxford University Press, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jokes]], Camp,  [[play (theatre)|Play]]; [[Anti-art]], [[Situationist Aesthetics]]; [[Gay Aesthetics]], [[Lesbian Aesthetics]]; [[Law and Art]], [[Moral Rights of Arts]], [[Cultural Property]], [[Obscenity]], [[Politics and Aesthetics]], [[Morality and Aesthetics]].&lt;ref name="Patella"/&gt; The longest entry, 35 pages, was for [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt;

'''''Gallery of Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in Brussels''''' is a 17th-century painting of [[Archduke Leopold Wilhelm]]'s Italian art collection by the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] painter [[David Teniers the Younger]], now held in the [[Schleissheim Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/57564 Interieur van het schilderijenkabinet van aartshertog Leopold te Brussel met de Italiaanse schilderijen, na 1656] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting shows the Archduke as a collector pointing with his cane towards a few paintings propped against each other on the floor. Behind him is the artist wearing a gold chain and sword, the attributes of honor for his role as gallery director for the archduke. Above the door is a portrait of another patron of the artist, [[King Philip IV of Spain]], and behind the large paintings on the right is a bust on a pedestal of [[Queen Christina of Sweden]]. On the left behind the table is an assistant holding a print. The table foot has been documented as a creation of the sculptor [[Adriaen de Vries]] depicting [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]]. The paintings are arranged in rows on the walls, and is one of the paintings that [[David Teniers the Younger]] prepared to document the Archduke's collection before he employed 12 engravers to publish his ''[[Theatrum Pictorium]]'', considered the "first illustrated art catalog". He published this book of engravings after the Archduke had moved to Austria and taken his collection with him. It was published in Antwerp in 1659 and again in 1673.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125009347911 Online version] of the [[Theatrum Pictorium]], 1673&lt;/ref&gt;

In her catalog raisonné of Teniers' works, Margret Klinge dates this painting after 1654 because in the similar gallery painting dated 1653 his portrait does not show the keys, chain, and sword that he is shown wearing in the portrait by [[Philips Fruytiers]] dated 1655. Furthermore, the painting of ''[[The Three Philosophers]]'' and several other Italian paintings are painted in mirror image, which may indicate that he was working from his miniature copy rather than the original, which would have been a necessity after the Archduke left Brussels with his collection to return to Vienna in 1656.

==List of paintings depicted==
The following is a list of the recognizable paintings of the collection, not all of which were included in the Italian catalog prepared by Teniers, which was a selection of 243 of the most prized paintings out of a collection of 1300-1400 pieces. Many are still in the Viennese collection. Here is a list of the paintings depicted, which starts with the paintings at the top left, running from left to right and from top to bottom and continuing in the same way with the rear wall on the right.

[[File:Geguti.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the royal palace of Geguti]] 

'''Geguti''' ({{lang-ka|გეგუთი}}) is a [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] medieval royal palace, now in ruins, at the homonymous village, 7 km south of the city of [[Kutaisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. 

The ruins of the Geguti palace complex occupy the area of over 2,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; along the [[Rioni River]]. An extensive fieldwork between 1953 and 1956 allowed the specialists to stratify the principal archaeological layers and reconstruct the architectural form and decoration of the medieval edifices bulk of which dates to the 12th century, the period when the first written mention of Geguti appears in the Georgian Chronicle. The earliest structure – a plain, one-room building with a large fireplace – dates back to the 8th/9th century. A principal part of the royal complex, commissioned by King [[George III of Georgia]] (r. 1156-1184), is a four-tier brick edifice built onto a three-metre high stone plinth, with its spacious, cruciform central hall surmounted by a dome 14 m in diameter resting on squinches. The entire building is walled and fortified with massive pillars. Westerly located additional structures and a palace church are of a later period, dating to the 13th/14th century. 

The importance of the ruins of the Geguti palace is emphasized by its largely secular nature as most of the surviving monuments of medieval Georgian architecture are churches and monasteries. Records of medieval secular patronage (basically palaces with extensive decorative cycles) exist in the Georgian written sources, although only the shells of castles and the ruins of Geguti survive to testify the extent of the work produced.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Turner (ed., 1996). ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art|The Dictionary of Art]]'', p. 331. Grove, {{ISBN|1-884446-00-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main complex of the Geguti royal palace was constructed during what is considered to be medieval Georgia's "[[golden age]]". Although the Georgian court was quite mobile, the establishment of a royal palace of this scale near the kingdom’s second capital and a major cultural center can be understood as the desire to establish a more settled, regal court, and royal bureaucracy which, indeed, reached its climax under the [[queen regnant]] [[Tamar of Georgia|Tamar]] (r. 1184-1213).&lt;ref name="Eastmond"&gt;Antony Eastmond (1998), ''Royal Imagery in Medieval Georgia'', pp. 152, 188-190. Penn State Press, {{ISBN|0-271-01628-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Geguti palace frequently features in the Georgian annals as a beloved place of rest of the Georgian royalty. In the reign of Tamar, it was the place where her former husband, Prince [[Yuri Bogolyubsky]], was crowned by the rebellious nobles during an abortive coup against the queen in 1191.&lt;ref name="Eastmond"/&gt;

In 2016, a glass panel installation was erected, surrounding the ruins, to show visitors the complete original shape of the monument.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Technology shows historic Geguti Palace 800 years ago|url=http://agenda.ge/news/53983/eng|accessdate=6 November 2016|work=Agenda.ge|date=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerolamo Induno''' (13 December 1825 – 18 December 1890) was an Italian painter and soldier, best known for his military scenes. His older brother, [[Domenico Induno|Domenico]], was also a well-known artist and they often worked together.

==Biography==
He was born in Milan, where his father was a chef and butler at the Milanese court. He took his first formal art lessons at the [[Brera Academy]], where he studied with [[Luigi Sabatelli]] from 1839 to 1846.&lt;ref name="U"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/gerolamo-induno_(L'Unificazione)/ Biographical notes] from L'Unificazione (2011) @ [[Treccani]].&lt;/ref&gt; His first exhibit was in 1845; composed of portraits and a scene from ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' by [[Alessandro Manzoni]] (now lost).&lt;ref name="D"&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/gerolamo-induno_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ Biography and appreciation] form Dizionario Biorafico, (2004) @ Treccani.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1848, he and Domenico were participants in the [[Five Days of Milan]] and had to flee to avoid reprisals by the Austrian government. They spent two years in [[Ticino]], then returned and settled in Florence.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; His brother went back to painting, but he enlisted in a volunteer regiment led by General [[Giacomo Medici (general)|Giacomo Medici]] and fought against the French during their [[Roman Republic (19th century)#French siege|siege of Rome]].&lt;ref name="U" /&gt; He also managed to produce numerous sketches of the war.
[[File:Artgate Fondazione Cariplo - Induno Gerolamo, La partenza del garibaldino.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Departure of the Garibaldino, 1860 ([[Fondazione Cariplo]])]]
While engaged in the defense of the {{ill|Villa del Vascello|it}}, near [[Porta San Pancrazio]], he was stabbed with several bayonets and seriously wounded while leading a charge. After a long  recovery, he was able to return to Milan under the protection of Count [[Giulio Litta]], a composer and avid art collector. Because of his injuries, he was exempt from being inducted into the Austrian army and went to work in his brother's studio.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; In the following years, he created many works based on the events of the [[Risorgimento]], as well as [[Genre art|genre]] works, influenced by his brother.

From 1854 to 1855, during the [[Crimean War]], he was back in uniform; this time with the [[Bersaglieri]] of [[Alessandro Ferrero La Marmora|Alessandro La Marmora]]. Once again, he made numerous sketches that were turned into paintings and lithographs. These included a depiction of the [[Battle of the Chernaya]] that was purchased by King [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]].&lt;ref name="U" /&gt; Some of his works were exhibited at the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris. In 1859, despite lingering health issues, he enlisted in the [[Hunters of the Alps]] and came to be recognized by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi|Garibaldi]] as the official painter of the Risorgimento, especially on matters of an official character.&lt;ref name="D" /&gt; His genre scenes became almost entirely devoted to military themes.

During the 1860s, in addition to his patriotic canvases, he created some large decorative works; including an allegory on Rome and Florence for the new [[Milano Centrale railway station]] (now demolished), and a curtain depicting the "{{ill|Plebisciti risorgimentali|it|lt=Plebiscite}} of Naples" for the theater in [[Gallarate]]. In 1861, he received a gold medal at an exhibition in Florence for his painting of the [[Battle of Magenta]], but gave it up in solidarity with the painters who had been overlooked.&lt;ref name="U" /&gt;

After unification had been achieved, his genre works tended to focus on scenes from the seventeenth century and he began to exhibit paintings on a wider variety of topics outside Italy, including Vienna (1873), Paris (1878), Antwerp (1885) and London (1888). His best-known work from this period is "A Game of Chess", a scene from a play of the same name by [[Giuseppe Giacosa]]. He died in Milan in 1890, after a long illness.

'''''Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan on 16 November 1581''''' is a painting by Russian [[realism (arts)|realist]] artist [[Ilya Repin]] made between 1883 and 1885.  The picture portrays a grief-stricken [[Ivan the Terrible]] cradling his mortally wounded son, the [[Tsarevich]] [[Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich of Russia|Ivan  Ivanovich]].  The elder Ivan himself is believed to have dealt the fatal blow to his son.&lt;ref name="Perry and Pavlov" /&gt;

The work is variously referred to as ''Ivan the Terrible and His Son Ivan'', with or without the date, or ''Ivan the Terrible Killing His Son''.&lt;ref name="G18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AllArt" /&gt;  Repin's painting has been called one of Russia's most famous paintings, and is also one of its most controversial.&lt;ref name="G18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TAN18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ArtGuide"/&gt; It has been vandalised twice, in 1913 and again in 2018.

The artist used [[Grigoriy Myasoyedov]], his friend and fellow artist, as the model for Ivan the Terrible, with writer [[Vsevolod Garshin]] modelling for the Tsarevich.&lt;ref name="AllArt" /&gt; In 1885, upon completion of the oil on canvas work, Repin sold it to [[Pavel Tretyakov]], for display in his gallery.&lt;ref name="G18" /&gt; It remains on display in the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] in [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="NYT18" /&gt;

==Background and content ==
In his memoirs, Repin said he was inspired to create the painting by the 1881 assassination of [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]], the music of [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], and the [[bullfighting]] he had witnessed in 1883.&lt;ref name="G18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AllArt" /&gt; 

The work is a large canvas, {{convert|199.5|x|254|cm}}.&lt;ref name="Valkenier"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Tretyakov Gallery, Moscow: Russian and Soviet Painting |date=1986 |publisher=Aurora Art Publishers |url=https://books.google.com/?id=R7ZBAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=199.5+by+254++%22Ivan+the+Terrible+and+His+Son+Ivan%22&amp;dq=199.5+by+254++%22Ivan+the+Terrible+and+His+Son+Ivan%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures of Ivan and his son are depicted in a darkened room, with a blood red carpet.&lt;ref name="Fetzer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fetzer |first1=Leland |title=Art and Assassination: Garshin's 'Nadezhda Nikolaevna' |journal=The Russian Review |date=1975 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=55–65 |jstor=127759 |doi=10.2307/127759 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ivan wears an austere black coat, contrasting with the more extravagant pink satin dressing gown and teal green boots worn by his son. The room is furnished with 17th century furniture and objects, which themselves reflect the violence that has been done: a chair is overturned; the rug is bunched up by the Tsarevich's feet.&lt;ref name="Haas"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haas |first1=Barbara |title=Wrestling with Russia |journal=Still Point Arts Quarterly |date=2017 |url=https://www.engl.iastate.edu/wp-content/uploads/russia_does_something_russian.pdf |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although one version of the title of the painting is ''Ivan the Terrible Killing His Son'', the work does not depict Ivan the Terrible delivering a fatal blow, but rather the Tsar holding the Tsarevich in his arms, his face a mask of horror and despair, attempting to staunch the flow of blood from his son's temple. It probably dawns on the mentally unstable monarch that, by killing his son, he planted the seed for the [[Time of Troubles]] and the demise of his dynasty (as his only remaining heir is a [[Feodor I of Russia|dim-witted younger son]] who would be easily manipulated by powerful [[boyar]]s).&lt;ref&gt;Н. А. Яковлева. Реализм в русской живописи: история жанровой системы. М.: Белый город, 2007. {{ISBN|9785779312080}}. P. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences between Repin's sketches and his final work indicate a distancing of the Tsar from the attack on the Tsarevich: in early versions, Ivan the Terrible is holding the sceptre used to deliver the blow, but the instrument is left out of the completed work.&lt;ref name="Valkenier"/&gt;  The work is disturbing in the power of the emotions shown and in its "gory representation of violence".&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt; Repin later said of the time when he painted it, that "A trail of blood ran through that year... Terrible scenes were in everybody's mind."&lt;ref name="Sternin"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sternin |first1=Grigori |last2=Kirillina |first2=Jelena |title=Ilya Repin |date=2013 |publisher=Parkstone Press International |location=New York |isbn=9781844849161 |page=108 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2Gwmo3Uaa4C&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The composition reflects two paintings by [[Rembrandt]] which Repin had studied and admired at the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], ''[[The Return of the Prodigal Son (Rembrandt)|The Return of the Prodigal Son]]'' and ''[[David and Jonathan (Rembrandt)|David and Jonathan]]''.&lt;ref name="Valkenier"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Repin experimented with several different models for his subjects – for Ivan, an old man found by the painter [[Pavel Chistyakov]], then a craftsman, the composer {{ill|Pavel Blaramberg|fr|Pavel  Blagamberg|ru|Бларамберг, Павел Иванович}}, and finally the painter [[Grigoriy Myasoyedov]]; for the Tsarevich, the landscape painter {{ill|Vladimir Menk|fr|Vladimir Menk|ru|Менк, Владимир Карлович}} and finally the writer [[Vsevolod  Garshin]].&lt;ref name="Valkenier"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Valkenier |first1=Elizabeth Kridl |title=The Writer as Artist's Model: Repin's Portrait of Garshin |journal=Metropolitan Museum Journal |date=January 1993 |volume=28 |pages=207–216 |doi=10.2307/1512927 |jstor=1512927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repin showed the completed painting to friends in 1885, to a mixed reaction, some praising its accomplishment, and others challenging its historical accuracy.  Repin sold it to his patron [[Pavel Tretyakov]].&lt;ref name="G18"/&gt;  He painted a second version of the painting in 1909 for {{ill|Stepan Ryabushinsky|fr|Stepan Riabouchinski|de|Stepan Pawlowitsch Rjabuschinski|ru|Рябушинский, Степан Павлович}}, which was given the title ''Infanticide'' (Сыноубийца); it is held by the {{ill|Voronezh Art Museum|ru|Воронежский_областной_художественный_музей_имени_И._Н._Крамского}}.&lt;ref name="Voronezh"&gt;{{cite web |title="A Day in the Museum for the Russian Cadets" |url=http://mkram.ru/en/2017/09/13/a-day-in-the-museum-for-the-russian-cadets/ |website=Voronezh Regional Art Museum.

==Critical assessment==
Repin's work has been compared to the [[Tenebrism|Spanish school]], and specifically to that of [[Jusepe de Ribera]], for its "masterly regard for the dramatic effect" and its "primitive force and ferocity".&lt;ref name="Brinton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brinton |first1=Christian |title=The Ilya Repin Exhibition: Introduction and Catalogue of the Paintings. Held at the Kingore Galleries, New York City, 1921 |date=31 January 2003 |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |isbn=9780543889850 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=IBoEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Ivan+the+Terrible+and+His+Son+Ivan%22++Ilya+Repin#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ivan%20the%20Terrible%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The events leading to the death of Tsarevich Ivan Ivanovich in November 1581 remain a controversial topic in Russia, with some Russian nationalists disputing the historical accuracy of the usual account of the event.&lt;ref name="ArtGuide"&gt;{{cite web |title=Repin’s “Ivan the Terrible:” Patterns in the theme of modernity |website=ArtGuide |date=2013 |url=http://artguide.com/en/posts/446-ivan-groznyi-riepina-uzory-na-tiemu-sovriemiennosti |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts vary on the causes of the death, the subject of any argument (if there was one) and the precise dates of the events.  According to the usual account, relations between Ivan and his son were strained.  The Tsar had his son's first two wives, [[Eudoxia Saburova]] and [[Feodosiya Solovaya]], sent away to convents. While they were at the [[Alexandrov Kremlin]] in November 1581, Ivan is said to have assaulted his son's third wife, [[Yelena Sheremeteva]], for being inappropriately dressed.  She was pregnant, and the beating caused a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="Walthall"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Walthall |first1=Anne |title=Servants of the dynasty : palace women in world history |date=2008 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=9780520254442 |edition=[Online-Ausg.]. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MM8lDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA169 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Tsarevich reprimanded his father, and the Tsar responded by accusing his son of inciting rebellion by challenging his father and advocating attempts to relieve the on-going [[Siege of Pskov]].  Ivan struck his son with his sceptre, and also struck [[Boris Godunov]] when he tried to intervene.  The Tsarevich fell to the floor bleeding heavily.  Ivan was quickly remorseful, but his son died a few days later.&lt;ref name="Madariaga"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Madariaga |first1=Isabel de |title=Ivan the Terrible: first Tsar of Russia |date=2006 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven, Conn. |isbn=9780300119732 |pages=340–342, 444 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tM8hWv2SYdQC&amp;pg=PA340}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Repin's piece was temporarily removed from public display at the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] when word spread that [[Alexander III of Russia|Tsar Alexander III]] found it offensive to represent the first Russian tsar (that is, the founder of the [[Tsardom of Russia]]) as a murderer.&lt;ref name="G18" /&gt; The emperor himself forbade the exhibition of the painting until [[Alexey Bogolyubov]] petitioned him to change his mind.&lt;ref name="Aru" /&gt; 

In 2013 an open letter was sent to the Russian culture ministry by Orthodox Christian activists. The letter alleged that the painting was offensive to Russians as it presented an untrue, distorted view of history.&lt;ref name="G18" /&gt;  The letter asked the Russian Minister of Culture [[Vladimir  Medinsky]] to remove it from public display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Russia's Dangerous Struggle With Obscurantism |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-repin-art-orthodoxy/25125740.html |website=Radio Free Europe |accessdate=30 July 2018|date= 3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The director of the Tretyakov Gallery, [[Irina Lebedeva]], objected.&lt;ref name="G18"/&gt;

==Vandalism==
=== 16 January 1913===
The painting has been attacked twice.   On 16 January 1913 (old style), {{ill|Abram  Balachov|ru|Балашов, Абрам  Абрамович}} attacked the painting three times with a knife, making three parallel slashes over the faces of Ivan and his son.  The director of the Tretyakov Gallery, [[Ilya Ostroukhov]], resigned.&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt; The curator of the Tretyakov Gallery, the landscape painter {{ill|Georgy Khruslov|fr|Gueorgui Khrouslov|ru|Хруслов, Георгий Моисеевич}} was so distressed by the vandalism that he threw himself under a train.  Repin returned to Moscow from Finland to restore the work.&lt;ref name="NYT18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Platt"/&gt;   

Repin viewed the attack as an expression of hatred towards his chosen artistic style and the older canons of taste with which he identified.  He suspected that the attack was "the result of that monstrous conspiracy against the classic and academic monuments of art which is daily gathering momentum", i.e. [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="Brinton"/&gt;

Balachov's attack on the painting was applauded by [[Russian symbolism|Symbolist]] poet [[Maximilian Voloshin]]. Voloshin published an essay "On the significance of the catastrophe that befell Repin's painting" and publicly repeated his views in a lecture sponsored by [[Russian Futurism|futurists]] at the Moscow [[Polytechnic Museum]].  Repin himself was in the audience and came to the podium to respond.&lt;ref name="Platt"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Levitt |editor1-first=Marcus C. |editor2-last=Novikov |editor2-first=Tatyana |last=Platt|first1=Kevin M. F. |chapter=On blood, scandal, renunciation and Russian history, Il'ia Repin's Ivan the terrible and his son Ivan  |title=Times of trouble : violence in Russian literature and culture |date=2007 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison, Wis. |isbn=9780299224301 |pages=112–122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0oThfxDIEBYC&amp;pg=PA112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 25 May 2018 ===
The painting was attacked again on 25 May 2018 when an inebriated visitor to the gallery smashed the security glass around the painting because he believed it to be historically inaccurate. He used one of the metal security poles used to hold the rope to keep visitors at a distance.&lt;ref name="NYT18" /&gt; The canvas was torn in three places though fortuitously not near the faces and hands of those portrayed.&lt;ref name="TAN18" /&gt; Because the artist used a heavy canvas, the painting was better able to withstand the attack.&lt;ref name="Lytvyn"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lytvyn |first1=Liliia |title=Repin's masterpiece seriously damaged by vandal in Tretyakov Gallery |url=https://arthive.com/news/3424~Repins_masterpiece_seriously_damaged_by_vandal_in_Tretyakov_Gallery |website=Art Hive |accessdate=31 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage was still reported as being "serious" with a special commission of art experts planning restoration which is expected to take several years.&lt;ref name="G18" /&gt; Olga Temerina, the deputy head of the Grabar Art Conservation Centre, says that they have Repin's notes from the first attack which may help with restoration work.&lt;ref name="G18" /&gt;

'''Julian Bicknell''' &lt;sub&gt;(MA Dip Arch RIBA FRSA AWG)&lt;/sub&gt; is a British architect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intbau.org/julian-bicknell.html |title=Julian Bicknell |first= |last= |work=intbau.org |year=2013 |accessdate=1 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415025451/http://www.intbau.org/julian-bicknell.html |archivedate=15 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.artworkersguild.org/member/julianbicknell/ |title=Julian Bicknell |first= |last= |work=Art Workers Guild |year=2013 |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Julian Bicknell was born in [[Cambridge]] on 23 February 1945, while his father Wing Commander Nigel Bicknell DSO DFC was in hospital at [[RAF Wroughton]] after a serious crash. Julian was educated at [[Mowden Hall School]], Stocksfield, Northumberland, and [[Winchester College]] before studying architecture at [[King's College Cambridge]] (MA, 1967).

==Career==
He started off working with [[Edward Cullinan]] in London (1966–72).  He joined the teaching staff at the [[Royal College of Art]] under Sir [[Hugh Casson]] in 1972, becoming director of the Royal College of Art Project Office (1973–79).  In 1979 he joined [[Arup Associates]] (reconstruction of [[Bedford School]]&lt;ref name="debretts"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/b/9583/Julian+BICKNELL.aspx |title=Julian Bicknell, Esq |first= |last= |work=[[Debrett's People of Today]] |year=2013 |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under Sir [[Philip Dowson]].  He set up Julian Bicknell &amp; Associates in 1983.

Bicknell's background is in modification, alteration and restoration of existing buildings, but his practice been most involved in the design and construction of new buildings in which the lessons of history are combined with contemporary architectural thinking and technology.  His work in the UK includes The Old Gaol, [[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] (RIBA Award 1976), new interiors at [[Castle Howard]] (Carpenters' Award 1984), projects for Oxford and Cambridge Colleges, the reconstruction of the [[Hunterian Museum]] for the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] and other projects involving sensitivity to complex historical contexts.   Private houses make up the bulk of Bicknell's work, including [[Henbury Hall, Cheshire]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/PalladianBritain/VillasInBritain/VillaRotondasInfluence/HenburyHall.aspx |title=Henbury Hall |first= |last= |work=architecture.com |year=2013 |accessdate=1 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322072550/http://www.architecture.com/LibraryDrawingsAndPhotographs/Palladio/PalladianBritain/VillasInBritain/VillaRotondasInfluence/HenburyHall.aspx |archivedate=22 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upton Parva, Warwickshire, [[Carden Hall]], Cheshire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2003/03/13/eight-bedrooms-a-great-hall-and-stables-92534-12730638/2/ |title=Eight bedrooms, a great hall and stables |first=Ron |last=Quenby |work=[[Liverpool Daily Post]] |date=13 March 2003 |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forbes House,Surrey, Forest of Bere, Hampshire, Hunterian Museum, RCS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bdonline.co.uk/buildings/technical/skeletons-out-of-the-closet/3047406.article |title=Skeletons out of the closet |first=Amanda |last=Birch |work=[[Building Design]] |date=25 February 2005 |accessdate=1 June 2013}} (registration required)&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Crest House, [[Takasaki]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.classicaladdiction.com/2011/02/new-classicism/nc-bicknell-royal-crest-house-takasaki/ |title=Royal Crest House, Takasaki |first= |last= |work=Classical Addiction |year=2013 |accessdate=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Princess Square, Esher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.princesssquare.com/architecture |title=Princess Square – Exceptional luxury new homes in Esher, Surrey |first= |last= |work=princesssquare.com |year=2013 |accessdate=1 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028225938/http://princesssquare.com/architecture/ |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the unusual oval house at Arragon Mooar, Isle of Man.

In 1983 his firm won the competition for a new residence for HM Ambassador in Moscow, although the contract was never awarded.  In the 1990s he designed and built a number of English style buildings for the leisure sector in Japan: restaurants, a golf club, banqueting facilities and a complete—and historically authentic—Shakespearean village.

Despite a growing number of building projects, he continues to teach in Britain, and abroad.  He was much involved in the development of the [[Prince of Wales Institute of Architecture]] between 1990 and 2000, on the Academic Board and as a teacher at the Institute itself and also at the ground-breaking international summer schools in Italy, Germany, France and the UK.  He has also taught and lectured in the USA, Russia and Japan.

==Associations==
He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a member of the College of Practitioners of [[INTBAU]] and of the Traditional Architecture Group.  He is a member of the [[Art Workers Guild]] and was its Master in 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32189">The '''knowledge argument''' (also known as  '''Mary's room'''  or '''Mary the super-scientist''') is a philosophical [[thought experiment]] proposed by [[Frank Cameron Jackson|Frank Jackson]] in his article "Epiphenomenal [[Qualia]]" (1982) and extended in "What Mary Didn't Know" (1986). The experiment is intended to argue against [[physicalism]]—the view that the universe, including all that is mental, is entirely physical. The debate that emerged following its publication became the subject of an edited volume—''There's Something About Mary'' (2004)—which includes replies from such philosophers as [[Daniel Dennett]], [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], and [[Paul Churchland]].

==Background==
Mary's Room is a thought experiment that attempts to establish that there are non-physical properties and attainable knowledge that can be discovered only through conscious experience. It attempts to refute the theory that all knowledge is physical knowledge. [[C. D. Broad]], [[Herbert Feigl]], and [[Thomas Nagel]], over a fifty-year span, presented insight to the subject, which led to Jackson's proposed thought experiment. Broad makes the following remarks, describing a thought experiment where an archangel has unlimited mathematical competences:

{{quote|He would know exactly what the microscopic structure of ammonia must be; but he would be totally unable to predict that a substance with this structure must smell as ammonia does when it gets into the human nose. The utmost that he could predict on this subject would be that certain changes would take place in the mucous membrane, the olfactory nerves and so on. But he could not possibly know that these changes would be accompanied by the appearance of a smell in general or of the peculiar smell of ammonia in particular, unless someone told him so or he had smelled it for himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Broad|1925|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Roughly thirty years later, Feigl expresses a similar notion. He concerns himself with a Martian, studying human behavior, but lacking human sentiments. Feigl says:

{{quote|...the Martian would be lacking completely in the sort of imagery and empathy which depends on familiarity (direct acquaintance) with the kinds of qualia to be imaged or empathized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Feigl|1958|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nagel takes a slightly different approach. In an effort to make his argument more adaptable and relatable, he takes the stand of humans attempting to understand the sonar capabilities of bats.

The thought experiment was originally proposed by Frank Jackson as follows:
{{Quotation|Mary is a brilliant scientist who is, for whatever reason, forced to investigate the world from a black and white room via a black and white television monitor. She specializes in the [[neurophysiology]] of vision and acquires, let us suppose, all the physical information there is to obtain about what goes on when we see ripe tomatoes, or the sky, and use terms like "red", "blue", and so on. She discovers, for example, just which wavelength combinations from the sky stimulate the retina, and exactly how this produces via the [[central nervous system]] the contraction of the vocal cords and expulsion of air from the lungs that results in the uttering of the sentence "The sky is blue". [...] What will happen when Mary is released from her black and white room or is given a [[color television]] monitor? Will she learn anything or not?&lt;ref name="p130"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jackson|1982|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, Jackson's Mary is a scientist who knows everything there is to know about the science of color, but has never ''experienced'' color. The question that Jackson raises is: once she experiences color, does she learn anything new? Jackson claims that she does.

There is disagreement about how to summarize the premises and conclusion of the argument Jackson makes in this thought experiment. Paul Churchland did so as follows:
# Mary knows everything there is to know about brain states and their properties.
# It is not the case that Mary knows everything there is to know about sensations and their properties.
# Therefore, sensations and their properties are not the same (≠) as the brain states and their properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Churchland|first=Paul M.|date=1985-01-01|title=Reduction, Qualia, and the Direct Introspection of Brain States|jstor=2026509|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=82|issue=1|pages=8–28|doi=10.2307/2026509}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Jackson objects that Churchland's formulation is not his intended argument. He especially objects to the first premise of Churchland's formulation: "The whole thrust of the knowledge argument is that Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to know about brain states and their properties, because she does not know about certain qualia associated with them. What is complete, according to the argument, is her knowledge of matters physical." He suggests his preferred interpretation:
# Mary (before her release) knows everything physical there is to know about other people.
# Mary (before her release) does not know everything there is to know about other people (because she learns something about them on her release).
# Therefore, there are truths about other people (and herself) which escape the physicalist story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Frank|date=1986-01-01|title=What Mary Didn't Know|jstor=2026143|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=83|issue=5|pages=291–295|doi=10.2307/2026143}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most authors who discuss the knowledge argument cite the case of Mary, but Frank Jackson used a further example in his seminal article: the case of a person, Fred, who sees a color unknown to normal human perceivers.

==Implications==
Whether Mary learns something new upon experiencing color has two major implications: the existence of [[qualia]] and the knowledge argument against physicalism.

===Qualia===
First, if Mary does learn something new, it shows that [[qualia]] (the subjective, qualitative properties of experiences, conceived as wholly independent of behavior and disposition) exist. If Mary gains something after she leaves the room — if she acquires knowledge of a particular thing that she did not possess before — then that knowledge, Jackson argues, is knowledge of the qualia of seeing red. Therefore, it must be conceded that qualia are real properties, since there is a difference between a person who has access to a particular quale and one who does not.

===Refutation of physicalism===
Jackson argues that if Mary does learn something new upon experiencing color, then [[physicalism]] is false. Specifically, the knowledge argument is an attack on the physicalist claim about the completeness of physical explanations of mental states. Mary may know everything about the science of color perception, but can she know what the experience of red is like if she has never seen red? Jackson contends that, yes, she has learned something new, via experience, and hence, [[physicalism]] is false. Jackson states:

{{quote|It seems just obvious that she will learn something about the world and our visual experience of it. But then it is inescapable that her previous knowledge was incomplete. But she had all the physical information. Ergo there is more to have than that, and Physicalism is false.&lt;ref name="p130"/&gt;}}

=== Epiphenomenalism ===
Jackson believed in the explanatory completeness of [[physiology]], that all behaviour is caused by physical forces of some kind. And the thought experiment seems to prove the existence of qualia, a non-physical part of the mind. Jackson argued that if both of these theses are true, then [[epiphenomenalism]] is true — the view that mental states are caused by physical states, but have no causal effects on the physical world.

Thus, at the conception of the thought experiment, Jackson was an epiphenomenalist.

==Responses==
Objections have been raised that have required the argument to be refined. Doubters cite various holes in the thought experiment that have arisen through critical examination.

Nemirow and Lewis present the "ability hypothesis", and Conee argues for the "acquaintance hypothesis".  Both approaches attempt to demonstrate that Mary ''gains no new knowledge, but instead gains something else''. If she in fact gains no new propositional knowledge, they contend, then what she does gain may be accounted for within the physicalist framework. These are the two most notable{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} objections to Jackson's thought experiment, and the claim it sets out to make.

=== Design of the thought experiment ===
Some have objected to Jackson's argument on the grounds that the scenario described in the thought experiment itself is not possible. For example, Evan Thompson questioned the premise that Mary, simply by being confined to a monochromatic environment, would not have any color experiences, since she may be able to see color when dreaming, after rubbing her eyes, or in afterimages from light perception.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, E. ''Colour Vision'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; However, Graham and Horgan suggest that the thought experiment can be refined to account for this: rather than situating Mary in a black and white room, one might stipulate that she was unable to experience color from birth, but was given this ability via medical procedure later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=George|last2=Horgan|first2=Terence|date=2000-05-01|title=Mary Mary, Quite Contrary|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1018779425306|journal=Philosophical Studies|language=en|volume=99|issue=1|pages=59–87|doi=10.1023/A:1018779425306|issn=0031-8116}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nida-Rümelin recognizes that one might question whether this scenario would be possible given the science of color vision (although Graham and Horgan suggest it is), but argues it is not clear that this matters to the efficacy of the thought experiment, provided we can at least conceive of the scenario taking place.&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;

Objections have also been raised that, even if Mary's environment were constructed as described in the thought experiment, she would not, in fact, learn something new if she stepped out of her black and white room to see the color red.  Daniel Dennett asserts that if she already truly knew "everything about color", that knowledge would necessarily include a deep understanding of why and how human neurology causes us to sense the "qualia" of color. Moreover, that knowledge would include the ability to functionally differentiate between red and other colors. Mary would therefore already know exactly what to expect of seeing red, before ever leaving the room. Dennett argues that functional knowledge is identical to the experience, with no ineffable 'qualia' left over.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Harvnb|Dennett|1991|p=398}} &amp; {{Harvnb|Dennett|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; J. Christopher Maloney argues similarly:  &lt;blockquote&gt;If, as the argument allows, Mary does understand all that there is to know regarding the physical nature of colour vision, she would be in a position to imagine what colour vision would be like. It would be like being in physical state S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, and Mary knows all about such physical states. Of course, she herself has not been in S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, but that is no bar to her knowing what it would be like to be in S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. For she, unlike us, can describe the nomic relations between S&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and other states of chromatic vision...Give her a precise description in the notation of neurophysiology of a colour vision state, and she will very likely be able to imagine what such a state would be like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maloney|first=J. Christopher|date=1985-03-01|title=About being a bat|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00048408512341671|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=63|issue=1|pages=26–49|doi=10.1080/00048408512341671|issn=0004-8402}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;Surveying the literature on Jackson's argument, Nida-Rümelin identifies, however, that many simply doubt the claim that Mary would not gain new knowledge upon leaving the room, including physicalists who do not agree with Jackson's conclusions. Most cannot help but admit that "new information or knowledge comes her way after confinement," enough that this view "deserves to be described as the received physicalist view of the Knowledge Argument."&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;

Some philosophers have also objected to Jackson's first premise by arguing that Mary could not know all the physical facts about color vision prior to leaving the room. Owen Flanagan argues that Jackson's thought experiment "is easy to defeat". He grants that "Mary knows everything about color vision that can be expressed in the vocabularies of a complete physics, chemistry, and neuroscience," and then distinguishes between "metaphysical physicalism" and "linguistic physicalism":  &lt;blockquote&gt;Metaphysical physicalism simply asserts that what there is, and all there is, is physical stuff and its relations. Linguistic physicalism is the thesis that everything physical can be expressed or captured in the languages of the basic sciences…Linguistic physicalism is stronger than metaphysical physicalism and less plausible.  &lt;/blockquote&gt;Flanagan argues that, while Mary has all the facts that are expressible in "explicitly physical language," she can only be said to have all the facts if one accepts linguistic physicalism. A metaphysical physicalist can simply deny linguistic physicalism and hold that Mary's learning what seeing red is like, though it cannot be expressed in language, is nevertheless a fact about the physical world, since the physical is all that exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=881540|title=Consciousness reconsidered|last=Flanagan|first=Owen J.|date=1992-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262061481|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Flanagan, Torin Alter contends that Jackson conflates physical facts with "discursively learnable" facts, without justification:  &lt;blockquote&gt;…some facts about conscious experiences of various kinds cannot be learned through purely discursive means. This, however, does not yet license any further conclusions about the nature of the experiences that these discursively unlearnable facts are about. In particular, it does not entitle us to infer that these experiences are not physical events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alter|first=Torin|date=1998|title=A Limited Defense of the Knowledge Argument|jstor=4320837|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=90|issue=1|pages=35–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;Nida-Rümelin argues in response to such views that it is "hard to understand what it is for a property or a fact to be physical once we drop the assumption that physical properties and physical facts are just those properties and facts that can be expressed in physical terminology."&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;

===Ability hypothesis===
Several objections to Jackson have been raised on the grounds that Mary does not gain new factual knowledge when she leaves the room, but rather a new ability. Nemirow claims that "knowing what an experience is like is the same as knowing how to imagine having the experience". He argues that Mary only obtained the ability to do something, not the knowledge of something new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1057122|title=Mind and cognition: a reader|date=1990-01-01|publisher=Basil Blackwell|isbn=0631160760|editor-last=Lycan|editor-first=William G.|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis put forth a similar argument, claiming that Mary gained an ability to "remember, imagine and recognize."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195032047.001.0001/acprof-9780195032048|title=Philosophical Papers Volume I - Oxford Scholarship|last=Lewis|first=David|doi=10.1093/0195032047.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the response to Jackson's knowledge argument, they both agree that someone makes a genuine discovery when she sees red for the first time, but deny her discovery involves coming to know some facts of which she was not already cognizant before her release. Therefore, what she obtained is a discovery of new abilities rather than new facts; her discovery of what it is like to experience color consists merely in her gaining new ability of how to do certain things, but not gaining new factual knowledge. In light of such considerations, Churchland distinguishes between two senses of knowing, "knowing how" and "knowing that", where knowing how refers to abilities and knowing that refers to knowledge of facts. He aims to reinforce this line of objection by appealing to the different locations in which each type of knowledge is represented in the brain, arguing that there is a true, demonstratively physical distinction between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=700224|title=A neurocomputational perspective: the nature of mind and the structure of science|last=Churchland|first=Paul M.|date=1989-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262031515|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Levin argues that a novel color experience does in fact yield new factual knowledge, such as "information about the color's similarities and compatibilities with other colors, and its effect on other of our mental states."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levin|first=Janet|date=1986-01-01|title=Could Love Be like a Heatwave?: Physicalism and the Subjective Character of Experience|jstor=4319824|journal=Philosophical Studies|volume=49|issue=2|pages=245–261}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tye counters that Mary could have (and would have, given the stipulations of the thought experiment) learned all such facts prior to leaving the room, without needing to experience the color firsthand. For example, Mary could know the fact "red is more like orange than green" without ever experiencing the colors in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=2405834|title=Consciousness, color, and content|last=Tye|first=Michael|date=2000-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0262201291|series=Representation and mind|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Earl Conee objects that having an ability to imagine seeing a color is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to see that color, meaning the ability hypothesis does not capture the nature of the new knowledge Mary acquires upon leaving the room. To show that ability is not necessary, Conee cites the example of someone who is able to see colors when she is looking at them, but who lacks the capacity to imagine colors when she is not. He argues that while staring at something that looks red to her, she would have knowledge of what it is like to see red, even though she lacks the ability to imagine what it is like. In order to show precisely that imaginative abilities are not sufficient for knowing what it is like, Conee introduces the following example: Martha, "who is highly skilled at visualizing an intermediate shade that she has not experienced between pairs of shades that she has experienced...happens not to have any familiarity with the shade known as cherry red". Martha has been told that cherry red is exactly midway between burgundy red and fire red (she has experienced these two shades of red, but not cherry). With this, Martha has the ability to imagine cherry red if she so chooses, but as long as she does not exercise this ability, to imagine cherry red, she does not know what it is like to see cherry red.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conee|first=Earl|date=1994-06-01|title=Phenomenal knowledge|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00048409412345971|journal=Australasian Journal of Philosophy|volume=72|issue=2|pages=136–150|doi=10.1080/00048409412345971|issn=0004-8402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might accept Conee's arguments that imaginative ability is neither necessary nor sufficient for knowing what it is like to see a color, but preserve a version of the ability hypothesis that employs an ability other than imagination. For example, Gertler discusses the option that what Mary gains is not an ability to imagine colors, but an ability to recognize colors by their phenomenal quality.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gertler|first=Brie|date=1999-03-01|title=A Defense of the Knowledge Argument|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1004216101557|journal=Philosophical Studies|language=en|volume=93|issue=3|pages=317–336|doi=10.1023/A:1004216101557|issn=0031-8116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acquaintance hypothesis ===
Due to his dissatisfaction with the ability hypothesis, Earl Conee presents another variant. Conee's acquaintance hypothesis identifies a third category of knowledge, "knowledge by acquaintance of an experience," that is not reducible to factual knowledge nor to knowing-how. He argues that the knowledge Mary actually acquires post-release is acquaintance knowledge. Knowing an experience by acquaintance "requires the person to be familiar with the known entity in the most direct way that it is possible for a person to be aware of that thing". Since "experiencing a quality is the most direct way to apprehend a quality," Mary gains acquaintance with color qualia after release.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Conee thus defends himself against the knowledge argument like this:
# Qualia are physical properties of experiences (and experiences are physical processes). Let Q be such a property. 
# Mary can know all about Q and she can know that a given experience has Q before release, although — before release — she is not acquainted with Q. 
# After release Mary gets acquainted with Q, but she does not acquire any new item of propositional knowledge by getting acquainted with Q (in particular she already knew under what conditions normal perceivers have experiences with the property Q).&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;
Tye also defends a version of the acquaintance hypothesis that he compares to Conee's, though he clarifies that acquaintance with a color should not be equated to applying a concept to one's color experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=3955331|title=Consciousness revisited: materialism without phenomenal concepts|last=Tye|first=Michael|date=2009-01-01|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262012737|series=Representation and mind|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Conee's account, one can come to know (be acquainted with) a phenomenal quality only by experiencing it, but not by knowing facts about it as Mary did. This is different from other physical objects of knowledge: one comes to know a city, for example, simply by knowing facts about it. Gertler uses this disparity to oppose Conee's account: a dualist who posits the existence of qualia has a way of explaining it, with reference to qualia as different entities than physical objects; while Conee describes the disparity, Gertler argues that his physicalist account does nothing to explain it.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== The neural basis of qualia ===
[[V.S. Ramachandran]] and Edward Hubbard of the Center for Brain and Cognition at [[UCSD]] argue that Mary might do one of three things upon seeing a red apple for the first time:
# Mary says she sees nothing but gray.
# She has the "Wow!" response from subjectively experiencing the color for the first time.
# She experiences a form of ''[[blindsight]]'' for color, in which she reports seeing no difference between a red apple and an apple painted gray, but when asked to point to the red apple, she correctly does.

They explain further: "Which of these three possible outcomes will actually occur? We believe we've learned the answer from a [[colorblind]] [[Grapheme-color synesthesia|synesthete]] subject. Much like the theoretical Mary, our colorblind synesthete volunteer cannot see certain hues, because of deficient color receptors. However, when he looks at numbers, his [[synesthesia]] enables him to experience colors in his mind that he has never seen in the real world. He calls these "Martian colors." The fact that color cells (and corresponding colors) can activate in his brain helps us answer the philosophical question: we suggest that the same thing will happen to Mary."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramachandran|first=V. S. |author2=Edward M. Hubbard.  |url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=more-common-questions-abo-2003-04-14 |title=More Common Questions about Synesthesia |journal=Scientific American |date=April 14, 2003 |accessdate=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramachandran and Hubbard's contribution is in terms of exploring "the neural basis of qualia" by "using pre-existing, stable differences in the conscious experiences of people who experience synaesthesia compared with those who do not" but, they note that "this still doesn't explain why these particular events are qualia laden and others are not (Chalmers' 'hard problem') but at least it narrows the scope of the problem" (p.&amp;nbsp;25).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ramachandran|first=V. S. |author2=Edward M. Hubbard.  |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/imp/jcs/2001/00000008/00000012/1244 |title=Synaesthesia – A window into perception, thought and language |journal=Journal of Consciousness Studies |date=January 1, 2001 |accessdate=2011-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dualist responses ===
Jackson's argument is meant to support dualism, the view that at least some aspects of the mind are non-physical. Nida-Rümelin contends that, because dualism is relatively unpopular among contemporary philosophers, there are not many examples of dualist responses to the knowledge argument; nevertheless, she points out that there are some prominent examples of dualists responding to the Knowledge Argument worth noting.&lt;ref name="plato" /&gt;

Jackson himself went on to reject epiphenomenalism, and dualism altogether. He argues that, because when Mary first sees red, she says "wow", it must be Mary's qualia that causes her to say "wow". This contradicts epiphenomenalism because it involves a conscious state causing an overt speech behavior. Since the Mary's room thought experiment seems to create this contradiction, there must be something wrong with it. Jackson now believes that the physicalist approach (from a perspective of [[Direct and indirect realism|indirect realism]]) provides the better explanation. In contrast to epiphenominalism, Jackson says that the experience of red is entirely contained in the brain, and the experience immediately causes further changes in the brain (e.g. creating memories). This is more [[Consilience|consilient]] with neuroscience's understanding of [[color vision]]. Jackson suggests that Mary is simply discovering a new way for her brain to represent qualities that exist in the world. In a similar argument, philosopher [[Philip Pettit]] likens the case of Mary to patients suffering from [[akinetopsia]], the inability to perceive the motion of objects. If someone were raised in a stroboscopic room and subsequently 'cured' of the akinetopsia, they would not be surprised to discover any new facts about the world (they do, in fact, know that objects move). Instead, their surprise would come from their brain now allowing them to ''see'' this motion.

Despite a lack of dualist responses overall and Jackson's own change of view, there are more recent instances of prominent dualists defending the Knowledge Argument. [[David Chalmers]], one of the most prominent contemporary dualists, considers Jackson's thought experiment to successfully show that materialism is false. Chalmers considers responses along the lines of the "ability hypothesis" objection (described above) to be the most promising objections, but unsuccessful: even if Mary does gain a new ability to imagine or recognize colors, she would also necessarily gain factual knowledge about the colors she now sees, such as the fact of how the experience of seeing red relates to the physical brain states underlying it. He also considers arguments that knowledge of what it is like to see red and of the underlying physical mechanisms are actually knowledge of the same fact, just under a different "mode of presentation," meaning Mary did not truly gain new factual knowledge. Chalmers rejects these, arguing that Mary still necessarily gains new factual knowledge about how the experience and the physical processes relate to one another, i.e. a fact about exactly what kind of experience is caused by those processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://webcat1.library.ubc.ca:80/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=1152375|title=The conscious mind: in search of a fundamental theory|last=Chalmers|first=David John|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195105532|series=Philosophy of mind series|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martine Nida-Rümelin|Nida-Rümelin]] defends a complex, though similar, view, involving properties of experience she calls "phenomenal properties."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195171655.003.0013|title=Grasping Phenomenal Properties|last=Nida‐Rümelin|first=Martine|pages=307–338|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195171655.003.0013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
[[File:The Artwork of Larry D. Alexander 005.jpg|thumb|"Send in the Clown", a "Pen &amp; Ink" "Crosshatching drawing" by Alexander]]
Born in the small rural town of [[Dermott, Arkansas]] to Robert and Janie Alexander, Larry is the fourth of ten children and the second of the union of his parents.  His father was a truck driver, and his mother was a beautician. Alexander began drawing at about the age of four. He never received any formal art training during any level of his schooling while growing up, as none was available in his small rural hometown. After graduating from [[Dermott High School]] in May 1971, Alexander moved to [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]], where he studied Architectural Residential Design at Pines Vocational Technical School, now [[Southeast Arkansas College]]. In later years he also attended [[Richland College]] in [[Dallas, Texas]] where he studied [[AutoCAD]].

Today, six pieces of his work from his popular "Dermott Series", a series of paintings he painted about his childhood home of Dermott, are now a part of the permanent collection at [[the Arts and Science Center for Southeast Arkansas]] in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]]. Alexander's work is mostly influenced by his experiences in life, such as growing up in the rural south during the 1950s and 1960s, as well as his life in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] during the 1970s and 1980s.

Alexander moved to [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] after two years of school in [[Pine Bluff]] to seek employment in his chosen field. However, he was unsuccessful in the short run, and instead, he ended up finding work in a [[Chrysler]] auto assembly plant and became fascinated with the innerworkings of cars. This led him to become a certified mechanic, a craft he worked at for the next seventeen years. He ultimately met and married his wife, Patricia while living in Detroit, and they moved their family to [[Irving, Texas]] where he opened his own auto repair shop and operated it until 1991.

Encouraged by Patricia, he began using his art talent for the first time in fifteen years. His career as a professional artist can be traced back to this point as he developed his "[[pen and ink]]" style that he calls "[[crosshatching]]", and used it to create several lines of greeting cards under his, now defunct, "Alexander Greeting Cards Company" name. He coined the phrase "The Expressions Line" for his first line of greeting cards in 1991, but did not trademark the name. As a result, [[Hallmark Cards]] now has used the name on a line of their cards since 1997. His line should not be confused or associated with their product line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Alexander%2C+Larry+D.&amp;Search_Code=NALL&amp;PID=7hgPTsH43_NGlNt8hd8twcRb17De&amp;SEQ=20100318205238&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1 - Library of Congress - Alexander, Larry Dell - 1953]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faqs.org/copyright/alexander-greeting-card-company-presents-the-save-the/ - Alexander Greeting Cards - Larry Dell Alexander]&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1991 and 1994 he created over 80 pieces of "pen and ink" [[fine art]],&lt;ref name="cocatalog.loc.gov"&gt;[http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=Alexander%2C+Larry+D.&amp;Search_Code=NALL&amp;PID=7hgPTsH43_NGlNt8hd8twcRb17De&amp;SEQ=20100318205238&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1 - Library of Congress - Alexander, Larry D. - 1953]&lt;/ref&gt; including "Renetta", "Girlfriends", "Cowboy Fiddler", "Young Kennedys", and "Roundup". He also used many of his drawings on his "Fine-arTshirt" T-shirt line of the mid-nineties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20025.jpg - "Artist donates design to help homeless" - Artime Magazine/Irving News section - Oct. 1994 - page 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexander is also a "[[realist painter]]" who works in a variety of other mediums including [[oil paint|oils]], [[acrylic paint|acrylics]], and [[watercolors]]. He is a self-taught artist who chooses mostly to do exhibits in venues that provide mainstream exposure to a large variety of people such as festivals, schools, malls, libraries, banks, art institutions, and even [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] branches on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news-2/"Texas artist to show new prints at festival" - Pine Bluff Commercial - Friday May 20, 2005 - page 1D]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news/larry-d-alexander-news-003/ - "Works by Dermott native accepted by Arts Center" - Thur.

===The Dermott Series===
In early 1996 Alexander finished and released his popular "Dermott Series", a 20 piece collection of oil and acrylic paintings that offered a nostalgic look back at his childhood of growing up in rural southeast [[Arkansas]]. The paintings feature images of people, buildings, and sites of [[Dermott, Arkansas]], such as a cotton gin, his childhood house, where he went to school, and other images. Alexander said at the time that, "I did the Dermott Series for many personal reasons, and I'm overwhelmed by the response this collection is creating here in Texas". The series includes, "Birthplace", "Where I grew up", "Picking Cotton", "Cotton Gin", "Hot Grits", "In the kitchen with mama", and the old [[Chicot County]] High School, among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20006.jpg - "Alexander paints series of Dermott" - Chicot County Spectator - May 1, 1996 - pg.7]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Detroit Series===
In 1999 Alexander unveiled his "Detroit Series", a series of [[oil]] and [[acrylic paint|acrylic]] paintings of various sites in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] at the American Black Artist Institute on [[West Grand Boulevard]] in [[Detroit]]. The nine piece series includes paintings on [[Belle Isle Park]], the [[Detroit skyline]], the [[Detroit River]], [[Hitsville USA]] (the original home for [[Motown Records]]), [[Greektown Historic District]], the old [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)]], the old [[J.L. Hudson]] building, former mayor [[Coleman A. Young]], and many more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20012.jpg - "Alexander unveils his "Detroit Series"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.metrotimes.com/news-blawg/happy-birthday-larry-d-alexander/ - Detroit Metro Times - "Happy Birthday Larry D. Alexander" - May 30, 2014 - Michael Jackman]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Delta Series===
[[File:The Artwork of Larry D. Alexander 004.jpg|thumb|"Aunt Eira Mae", an Acrylic painting by Larry D. Alexander - [[The African American Museum (Dallas, Texas)]] - 2004]]

In May 1998 Alexander unveiled his "Delta Series, which was painted entirely with acrylics, during "[[the Arkansas Schools Tours]]". The tour was expanded that year to include stops in [[Greenville, Mississippi]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. This series included paintings of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain]] region from [[Monroe, Louisiana]] to Memphis. It includes a painting of [[Graceland]], [[Elvis Presley]]'s former home, the landmark Greenville Courthouse in Greenville, a perspective of [[Beale Street]] in Memphis, and his classic rendition of a "Cotton Farm" among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20014.jpg - Pine Bluff Commercial - "Artist announces plan for "Arkansas Tour" - May, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; Another piece from the Delta Series, "Aunt Eira Mae" was donated to the permanent collection of [[The African American Museum (Dallas, Texas)]] in 2004.

===The Series of P.A.T.R.I.C.E===
Alexander has also donated work to art departments of schools and colleges. In October 1996 at halftime at the inaugural football game, billed as the "[[Mobil]] Gridiron Classic", at [[Texas Stadium]] in [[Irving, Texas]], Alexander presented a piece from one of his series, "The series of P.A.T.R.I.C.E", to the president, and the chancellor, of the participating colleges, respectively, [[Texas Southern University]] and the [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20019.jpg - Pine Bluff Commercial - "Around and about" - Sun. October 27, 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Sixties Series===
Alexander's most popular [[Pen and Ink]] art series, "The Sixties Series" has been exhibited in schools, libraries, and art institutions in several places since it was completed in 1993. It consists of elaborate drawings of well known figures and events of the 1960s, such as the civil rights [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] of 1965, and portraits of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Lyndon Johnson]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Medgar Evers]], and [[Rosa Parks]]. This series also covers the [[Vietnam War]].

The theme pieces in the collection are a piece called "Composite Sixties", and one called "Composite Protests", which make up a composite of people, places and events that were prominent in the 1960s. For example, they show images of [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Lyndon Johnson]], and [[Richard M. Nixon]], the [[United States]] presidents who served during the sixties, also [[J. Edgar Hoover]], [[Jackie Kennedy]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], an image of U.S. astronauts landing on the moon in 1969, and many of the [[Americans|American]] protests that took place during this turbulent decade, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelarrydalexander.com/LARRYDALEXANDER/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news/larry-d-alexander-in-the-news-001/ - Pine Bluff Commercial - "Crawfish Festival brings Dermott native back home" - Fri. May 18, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

==African-American history book==
In 2001, Alexander finished his first book called ''African-American History at a Glance'', which also included several [[pen and ink]] drawings of [[African-Americans]] who have contributed substantially to the [[Americans|American]] success story. "There is a lack of input regarding [[African-Americans]] in the [[American history]] curriculum of schools all over [[United States|America]]" Mr. Alexander says. "There are a lot of schools that offer it as a choice to students, but I think it should be a part of regular [[American history]]".

Alexander's book was used to help create a supplemental text, that was later put together by the [[Irving Independent School District]] to help improve the [[American history]] curriculum in the high schools of [[Irving, Texas]] in 2002. His book deliberately ignores the contributions of [[African-Americans]] in the areas of sports and entertainment, as he feels they are already too well known and over-emphasized in society. Alexander says in his book that, "By no means is this an attempt to downplay the prowess of these particular individuals, or to discourage other individuals who aspire to excel in those areas. This publication is intent on bringing to the forefront, some of the [[African-American]] contributions that have historically been largely ignored".&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20020.jpg Dallas Morning News - "Broadening Minds" - Thur.

==The Arkansas School Tours==
Alexander and his cousin Lawrence "Larry" Crockett, both natives of [[Dermott, Arkansas]] put together the first "Arkansas schools tour" in 1996, and in May of that year, visited ten schools in seven cities in four days. Crockett and his son, B.J., both traveled with Alexander on the initial tour, while they were on a one-week break from the tour of the [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'', which B.J. had a role in at the time. After the first year however, the tour was continued on by Alexander alone through 2007. Alexander says he wanted to give back to his home state of Arkansas and be a blessing to the children who live there, and, because of the success of the first tour in 1996, Alexander decided to continue doing it once annually for the next ten years. Its major objective was to instill hope and encouragement in the children of Arkansas, and to aid them in making good choices during the developing stages of life. These annual visits to [[high schools]], [[middle schools]], and [[elementary schools]], were also conducted to instruct and encourage children in pursuing their goals and careers in the [[visual arts]], as well as other areas, and to stay away from [[illegal drugs]]. It was during the second tour in 1997 that Alexander incorporated his anti-drug slogan "Eradicate Drug Use Common Among Teens Everywhere" (EDUCATE). Alexander usually ended his tour with a two-day art exhibit and print signing at the [[Dermott, Arkansas]] [[Crawfish]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://larrydalexander.netfirms.com/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges///home/users/web/b1499/nf.larrydalexander/public_html/LarryD.Alexander-ArtfortheAges//wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Larry%20D.%20Alexander%20News%20028.jpg The McGehee Times/Dermott News - "Alexander to present artwork at Crawfish Festival" - Wed.

==Religion==
{{quote box |quote = It seems as if God has placed a hunger and thirst inside of each of us, innately from birth, and the only way to satisfy that hunger or thirst is by seeking and ultimately finding Him. It is for the purpose of God that man was ever created in the first place. And just as no man has ever created anything that weren't for his own purpose or benefit, so it is with God. Man was created to serve God.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">'''Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology, and Religious Belief''' ({{lang-de|Vorlesungen und Gespräche über Ästhetik, Psychoanalyse und religiösen Glauben}}) is a series of notes transcribed by [[Yorick Smythies]], [[Rush Rhees]], and James Taylor from assorted lectures by [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and published in 1967.&lt;ref name="springerlink"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n254782t5l634186/|title=Lectures and conversations on aesthetics, psychology and religious belief - Springer|accessdate=2014-10-14 | doi=10.1007/BF00137674|volume=3|journal=The Journal of Value Inquiry|pages=63–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lectures, at which [[Casimir Lewy]] was present, contain Wittgenstein's thoughts about [[aesthetics]] and [[religion]], alongside a critique of [[psychoanalysis]]. [[Wittgensteinian fideism]] originates from the remarks in the ''Lectures''. It is noteworthy that Eberhard Bubser in the introduction of the German edition states that: ″Wittgenstein would surely have not approved this release [...]″ (″Wittgenstein hätte diese Ausgabe bestimmt nicht gebilligt [...]″).&lt;ref name = "LWGer"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vorlesungen und Gespräche über Ästhetik, Psychologie und Religion.|author1=Wittgenstein, L.| date=1966|publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht|location=Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lectures on Aesthetics ==
One question Wittgenstein raises in his ''Lectures on Aesthetics'' is how we learn to use and recognize the words used to make an aesthetic judgment, such as ″beautiful″ (″schön″) or ″nice″ or (″fein″).&lt;ref name="LWGer" /&gt; He suggests that these words are firstly and often used like [[interjection]]s or gestures. Wittgenstein also notes that we seldom use these words in everyday language to make aesthetic judgments, but rather use words like ″right″ (″richtig″) or ″correct″ (″korrekt″).&lt;ref name="LWGer" /&gt; With regard to aesthetic pleasures, he also names a question that is recently under debate in aesthetics: How are distinctly aesthetic pleasures different from more ordinary pleasures? He makes a point in stating that ″One uses the same term in both cases [...]″ (″ Man gebraucht in beiden Fällen [...] dasselbe Wort″).&lt;ref name="LWGer" /&gt;

A recurring theme in these lectures is also Wittgenstein's firm rejection of the possibility that [[psychology]] may explain aesthetic experiences or judgments. This opinion is based on Wittgenstein's view that psychological ([[behaviorism|behaviorist]]) experiments would generate results based on mere descriptions of behavior and generalizations across large numbers of observers.

== Lectures on Religious Belief ==
In his Lectures on Religious Belief (''Vorlesungen über den religiösen Glauben''), Wittgenstein argues, among other things, that superficial grammatical similarities in the ''forms'' of both religious and factual statements mislead us into believing that they are fundamentally identical states of "belief."  This grammatical similarity, Wittgenstein argues, is merely a parallel ''expression'' of drastically different processes. "The '''expression''' of belief", Wittgenstein notes, "may play an absolutely minor role."&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lectures and Conversations on Aesthetics, Psychology, and Religious Belief|author1=Wittgenstein, L.|author2=Barrett, C.|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520251816|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njMBZkDSjk0C|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Limelight''''' is an [[Australia]]n monthly classical music and arts magazine based in [[Sydney]]. Founded in January 1976, the magazine was originally published under the name '''''ABC Radio 24&amp;nbsp;Hours''''', or simply ''24 Hours'', and relaunched as ''Limelight'' in June 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/iabc/stories/s823298.htm About the ABC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radio/celebrate100/history.htm Celebrating 100 Years of Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development and achievements ==
The magazine was originally a subsidiary of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s classical music radio station, [[ABC Classic FM]], and existed primarily to provide program details for the station's listeners.  The title ''24 Hours'' came to the inaugural Director of ABC FM, Christopher Symons, "literally in the middle of the night. It also occurred to me ... that if we got the magazine and its title established, it would be difficult for management to cut the station back to 18 hours a day".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Symons, "From 24 hours to ''24 Hours''", ''24 Hours'' magazine, January 1996, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2006 to January 2014 it was published by [[Haymarket Media Group]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Anni Heino|title=Limelight magazine faces closure|url=http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/article/limelight-magazine-faces-closure|accessdate=31 October 2015|work=Resonate Magazine|date=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; under licence from the ABC. From February 2014 ownership was transferred to Arts Illuminated Pty Ltd, and there is no longer any formal connection with the ABC.

In January 2012, it ceased listing detailed ABC Classic FM radio programs for the forthcoming month. This reflected a decision by ABC management to end forward programming, to allow greater flexibility.

The magazine focuses on the performing arts in general, but on the Australian classical music scene in particular. As of the November 2017 issue the magazine's editor was Jo Litson, a highly regarded Australian arts journalist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/node/17741]&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Litson, respected music journalist Clive Paget waas editor from 2013-2017. Francis Merson was the editor for four years prior to this. Under Merson, ''Limelight'' was awarded the Relaunch of the Year prize at the 2012 Publishers Australia Excellence Awards. This was in recognition of the magazine’s successful relaunch in June 2012, with a new design and greater editorial focus on contemporary music and reviews. Francis Merson also earned runner-up in Editor of the Year category.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.abccommercial.com/post/36042036437/abc-limelight-magazine-wins-relaunch-of-the-year-at]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limelight Awards ==
Between 2007 and 2012, ''Limelight'' held the [[Limelight Awards]] – the only classical music awards in Australia where the public were invited to vote and help recognise well-loved musicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haymarketmedia.asia/brands/limelight/ll-awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acoustics survey ==
The September 2011 issue of ''Limelight'' featured an in-depth survey of musicians to reveal the best (and worst) concert hall acoustics in Australia's 20 major concert halls, for orchestral, chamber and vocal music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Magazine/Archive.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The survey, which gathered opinions from 200 performers, critics and audience members, ranked the [[Perth Concert Hall (Western Australia)|Perth Concert Hall]] as the best overall venue and the [[Melbourne Recital Centre]] as the top venue for chamber music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/opera-beauty--if-only-she sounded-as-good-as-she-looks-20110811-1iotn.html#ixzz2OFEQkcw4]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sydney Opera House]]'s Joan Sutherland Theatre (previously known as the Opera Theatre) was found to have the worst acoustics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/theatre/opera-beauty--if-only-she-sounded-as-good-as-she-looks-20110811-1iotn.html#ixzz2OFEQkcw4]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Australian orchestra ranking ==
Featured in the April 2013 issue of ''Limelight'', a panel of 15 expert critics and professional musicians from around the country were blind-tested to determine Australia's top symphony orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Magazine/Archive.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever possible, repertoire was matched to ensure comparable adjudication and a fair result. In the test, each of the 15 judges was sent recordings of each orchestra on separate CDs labelled simply A to F. Ranking the orchestras from 1 to 6, the expert panel voted the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Adelaide Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Queensland Symphony Orchestra]] in the three top spots. The [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] was ranked in fourth place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.avhub.com.au/index.php/News/Hi-Fi/australian-orchestra-ranking.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of ownership March 2018==
In March 2018 Limelight magazine was purchased by a newly founded company, Limelight Arts Media Pty Ltd. The owners of the company are Sydney-based businessmen and music lovers Robert Veel and Bruce Watson. The sale of the magazine came about after the previous owners, Arts Illuminated Pty Ltd, experienced financial difficulties and announced that it did not have the funds to proceed with the March 2018 edition.

'''Lineography''' is the [[art]] of drawing without lifting the pen, pencil, or paintbrush that is being used.&lt;ref name="Maloney"&gt;{{ citation | last = Davis | first = Ken | authorlink =  | title = Thinking Inside the Box | journal = Unitrin Specialty Update | volume =  | issue =  | date = 2007-01-02 | page = 10 | url = http://leannmaloney.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/unitrinspecialtyupdatev2_jan07.pdf }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice originated in [[France]] in the seventeenth century. It fell into disuse by the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Hanton2"&gt;{{ cite book | last = Hanton | first = George | title = French Lineography | publisher = Gregory Kline Books | location = New York | year = 1927 | isbn = | oclc = | doi = | page = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lineography experienced a resurgence in 1960 with the release of the [[Etch A Sketch]].&lt;ref name="Maloney" /&gt;

In some instances, entire landscapes and still lifes have been drawn or painted using this lineographic technique.&lt;ref name="Hanton27"&gt;{{ cite book | last = Hanton | first = George | title = French Lineography | publisher = Gregory Kline Books | location = New York | year = 1927 | isbn = | oclc = | doi = | page = 27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Famous works of art, such as the [[Mona Lisa]], have been reproduced using the Etch A Sketch.&lt;ref name="Speeple"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://news.speeple.com/neatorama.com/2007/09/14/mona-lisa-in-etch-a-sketch.htm | title = Mona Lisa in Etch A Sketch | accessdate = 2008-02-01 | last = | first = | date = 2007-09-14 | publisher = Speeple News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The television show ''[[How It's Made]]'' used Lineography in the short segments at the beginnings of many episodes giving a summary of the history of the episode's subject.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

One way to distinguish an installation from a sculpture (this may not apply to every installation) is to try to imagine it in a different space. If the objects present difficulties in a different space than the original, it is probably an installation.

Artists in a number of genres have performed live painting, including famously [[LeRoy Neiman]] creating a painting during the [[1976 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=CMJ/&gt;  In the 1990s and 2000s, live painting became a hallmark of [[street art]] and [[graffiti artist]]s.
Live painting has evolved beyond painting in situ by the impressionists, to incorporating the general public and arenas' of Modern Times.

[[File:Correggio, cappella funeraria del mantegna, evangelista matteo.jpg|thumb|Correggio, ''Saint Matthew and the angel'']]
[[File:Mantegna, battesimo di cristo, 1506.jpg|thumb|Mantegna and studio, ''[[Baptism of Christ (Mantegna)|Baptism of Christ]]'']]
The '''Mantegna funerary chapel''' (Italian - ''cappella funeraria di Andrea Mantegna'') is one of the chapels of the [[Basilica of Sant'Andrea, Mantua]]. It houses the tomb of the painter [[Mantegna]] and his last two paintings - ''[[Baptism of Christ (Mantegna)|Baptism of Christ]]'' (1506, on the high altar and probably completed by his son Francesco) and ''[[Holy Family with St John the Baptist, St Elizabeth and St Zacharias]]'' (1504-1506). Its frescoes from 1507 were painted by his sons [[Ludovico Mantegna|Ludovico]] and [[Francesco Mantegna|Francesco]] and by a young [[Correggio]]. The tomb bears a bronze figure of Mantegna by Gianmarco Cavalli. 

==History==
Court painter to the [[House of Gonzaga|Gonzaga]]s for over 40 years, Mantegna's prestige meant he was granted a funerary chapel in the basilica which served their [[Marquisate of Mantua]] - this was the first side-chapel on the left beside [[Leon Battista Alberti]]'s nave. Correggio was probably in Mantua at the time of Mantegna's death and probably came up with the overall scheme as well as doing much of the actual painting. In general the chapel was inspired by the plan for the chapel of [[pope Innocent VIII]] in the [[Belvedere (Vatican)|Belvedere]] in the Vatican, painted between 1488 and 1490 and destroyed in the 18th century. Historic descriptions record (among other things) its ''Stories of St John the Baptist'' and its trompe l'oeil marble fittings, vaulting, festoons, domes, putti and cherubs.

==Description==
&lt;!---
La cappella ha forma quadrangolare, con una cupoletta poggiante su tre lunettoni tra [[pennacchio (architettura)|pennacchi]] triangolari. Al centro si trova lo stemma concesso al Mantegna in un tondo tra un finto pergolato su cui si aprono affacci con vasi di fiori: un evidente tributo ai giochi illusionistici della volta della [[Camera degli Sposi]]. Alla base della cupola corre un fregio antichizzante, con girali vegetali e forme a [[pelta]], un tipo di scudo greco. 

Nei pennacchi si trovano i quattro evangelisti affacciati su balconcini illusionisticamente proiettati verso lo spettatore, ciascuno col suo simbolo totemico del [[tetramorfo]]. Negli angoli si trovano finti bassorilievi con elementi vegetali all'antica, che richiamano la passione antiquaria del Mantegna, uniti da una finta decorazione marmorea che simula lo spessore della cornice della cupola. Ovunque, nella cupola come nei pennacchi, ricorre il tema dell'agrumeto, che fa da sfondo anche alla tela della ''[[Sacra Famiglia e famiglia del Battista]]'' e del ''Battesimo'', presenti in cappella, e che fu spesso usato dal Mantegna nella sua tarda attività. Se la cupola è talvolta attribuita ai figli di Mantegna, gli evangelisti dovrebbero essere di mano del Correggio. 

I lunettoni presentano nicchie a forma di conchiglia con medaglioni ovali che mostrano scene della vita del Battista, titolare della cappella. Si tratta di scene a monocromo, con un risalto prospettico adattato, nel caso delle scene laterali, per una visione di sbieco, altro omaggio ai monocromi dell'ultima produzione di Mantegna e alla sua passione per la [[prospettiva]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4894">'''Merovingian illumination''' is the term for the continental [[Franks|Frankish]] style of [[illuminated manuscript|illumination]] in the late seventh and eight centuries, named for the [[Merovingian dynasty]]. Ornamental in form, the style consists of [[initial]]s constructed from lines and circles based on [[Late Antique illumination]], title pages with [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s and crucifixes. Figural images were almost totally absent. From the eight century, [[zoomorphic]] decoration began to appear and become so dominant that in some manuscripts from [[Chelles Abbey|Chelles]] whole pages are made up of letters formed from animals. Unlike the contemporary [[Insular illumination]] with its rampant decoration, the Merovingian style aims for a clean page.

One of the oldest and most productive scriptoria was [[Luxeuil Abbey]], founded by the Irish monk [[Columbanus]] in 590 and destroyed in 732. [[Corbie Abbey]], founded in 662, developed its own version of the style, while Chelles and [[Laon]] were further centres. From the middle of the eighth century, Merovingian illumination was strongly influenced by insular illumination. An [[evangeliary]] from [[Abbey of Echternach|Echternach]] (Trier, Dombibliothek, Cod. 61 olim 134.) indicates that it came into the abbey as the collaborative work of Irish and Merovingian scribes. The foundation of [[Willibrord]] strongly influenced continental illumination and led to the brought Irish culture into the Merovingian realm.

A '''Nomoli''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|oʊ|m|oʊ|l|iː}}) is a carved stone figurine native to [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://africa.si.edu/collections/view/objects/asitem/People$00401633/2/title-asc?t:state:flow=3d318f72-8617-4bde-ba1f-b19ed158e54b |title=National Museum of African Art |website=africa.si.edu |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually made of [[soapstone]], [[limestone]] or [[granite]].&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Museum"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=628044&amp;partId=1 |title=nomoli figure |website=British Museum |language=en-GB |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Nomoli figurines are among the earliest works of art from [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref name="Emory"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carlos.emory.edu/exhibits/show/home/item/8011 |title=Figure, Pomdo or Nomoli · Michael C. Carlos Museum Collections Online |website=carlos.emory.edu |language=en-US |access-date=2018-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nomoli figurines and similar stone sculptures are the only known remains of an empire that existed hundreds of years ago in what is [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]] today.

Nomoli figurines are often associated with the [[Mende people|Mende]] people as they are often buried on [[Mende people|Mende]] land. They are used as oracles and for protection.&lt;ref name="Emory" /&gt;

Portuguese explorers recorded the presence of the figurines already in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian" /&gt; 

The Mende and [[Kissi people]] of Sierra Leone put these small statues near their homes and in fields of crops for protection and increased vegetation, as they believe the Nomoli figurines will give them good health, good harvest, and meals to eat.&lt;ref name="Emory" /&gt; 

During the 20th century, Sierra Leonean immigrants brought their [[ancestor]]’s Nomoli figurines with them to the United States as a way to preserve the spiritual powers of the past.

== Characteristics and description ==
Along the coastal region, Nomoli figurines are often carved into a crouching stance with a small object in its hands. Most Nomoli figurines are made out of [[soapstone]], [[limestone]], steatite, and in some cases, [[granite]]. 

Their heads are oblong shaped. Nomoli figurines buried deeper underground tend to be more well preserved than the ones discovered just beneath the surface of the earth.

'''Orroroo'''  is a town in the [[Yorke and Mid North]] region of [[South Australia]].  At the [[Census in Australia#2016|2016 census]], the locality of Orroroo had a population of 610 while its urban centre had a  population of 537.&lt;ref name= Census2016ssc/&gt; &lt;ref name= Census2016ucl/&gt;  The [[Wilmington-Ucolta Road]] passes through here, intersecting with the [[RM Williams Way]] which leads to the [[Birdsville Track|Birdsville]] and [[Oodnadatta Track]]s. The [[Peterborough–Quorn railway line]] extended from [[Peterborough railway station, South Australia|Peterborough]] to Orroroo also in 1881 and [[Quorn, South Australia|Quorn]] in 1882, connecting with the new [[Central Australia Railway]] from [[Port Augusta railway station|Port Augusta]]. These railways have now been abandoned. Orroroo is situated near [[Goyder's Line]], a line drawn up in 1865 by Surveyor General Goyder which he believed indicated the edge of the area suitable for agriculture.

==History==
Prior to European settlement, Orroroo was the home of the [[Ngadjuri]] [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] people whose domain was the area to the east of the Flinders Rangers. The name Orroroo  was thought to be an form of [[onomatopoeia]] in imitation of wind blowing through acacia trees. According to J. Gray, it actually meant 'early start', referring to the fact that the Ngadjuri, who usually camped at Pekina Creek, would move to camp at the Orroroo river the night before hunting for kangaroos, which would come up to the river at that point and thus allow them to make an early start at dawn for the hunt. &lt;ref&gt;*{{Cite journal | title = Notes on native tribe formerly resident at Orroroo, South Australia| last = Gray |first = J.|journal = The South Australian Naturalist| year = 1930 | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 4–6|url = https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132605#page/7/mode/1up| ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;Aboriginal origins, but the true meaning of the word is uncertain. The name was first used by an early pioneer who conducted a nearby coaching house which served travellers on the Burra-Blinman track.

In 1844, the first Europeans to settle, John and James Chambers, took up the [[Pekina, South Australia|Pekina]] Run which covered 320 square miles. They did not receive a millimetre of rain during the 17 months that they lived there. As a result of this [[drought]], they sold the Pekina Run for £30.

Charlie Easther settled in Orroroo during 1864 and opened up an eating house that became a popular stopping point for the [[Droving|drover]]s and [[bullocky]]s who travelled through the area. The town was surveyed in 1875, when Solly's Hut, a clay-pugged log structure, was constructed as the town's first house and is now used as a museum.  In September 1875, the town was officially named by [[George Goyder]] following  the suggestion made by Charlie Easther {{see below|Origin of the name "Orroroo"}}. The first land sales were made in May 1876. The town was granted its own local council, the [[District Council of Orroroo]], in 1887 (taking effect in 1888(, and the town's council offices were constructed in 1888.&lt;ref name="Australian Places"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reader's Digest Illustrated Guide to Australian Places|year=1993|publisher=Reader's Digest|location=Sydney, NSW|isbn=0-86438-399-1|pages=535}}&lt;/ref&gt; The District Council of Orroroo would survive until 1997, when it was merged to create the [[District Council of Orroroo Carrieton]].

On 24 August 1923, 230-volt electricity was connected to the town by Cr Martin Redden, Chairman of the District Council, in the presence of a large crowd. On 4 July 1962, the power house engines were shut down to change to AC power which gave the houses standard 240-volt power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.orroroo.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=295|publisher=District Council of Orroroo|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early irrigation scheme was formed after damming the Pekina Creek and creating the Pekina reservoir. Water from here was supplied to over 50 dairy farms. Orroroo had its own flour mill, several bakeries, carriage manufacturer and a butter factory, which still stands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Orroroo|url=http://www.orroroo.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=266|publisher=District Council of Orroroo|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orroroo is the service centre for a predominantly farming community with the main products being wheat, sheep, cattle, pigs and a kangaroo processor.

A local curiosity is nearby, called "Magnetic Hill", which is a [[gravity hill]] [[optical illusion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eureka4you.com/magnetichillworldwide/Peterborough-SA.htm Magnetic Hill - Peterborough - South Australia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Railways==
The town was connected by the [[Peterborough–Quorn railway line]] to [[Peterborough railway station, South Australia|Peterborough]] and [[Quorn railway station|Quorn]] in September 1881, and was served by a Class 1 station and a large Goods Shed. During 1962, concrete grain silos were built in the Yard. these provided the bulk of traffic until the railway was closed in 1987&lt;ref name=jev&gt;Evans, J 2009; ''Proceed to Quorn'' Railmac Publications {{Listed Invalid ISBN|978-1-86477-066-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Orroroo was the last attended station on the railway; staff were withdrawn and the station operated as "unattended" from August 1981.

Passenger services were discontinued during 1969, when the [[South Australian Railways]] withdrew the railcar service.

Grain continued to be hauled by rail from Orroroo until 1987, when all rail services were withdrawn by [[Australian National Railways Commission|Australian National]].&lt;ref name=jev/&gt; [[Steamtown Peterborough Railway Preservation Society|Steamtown]], a railway preservation group based at Peterborough, operated passenger trains for tourists to Orroroo and [[Eurelia]] until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kelly, B (as Editor) |date=2003 |title=Public Liability Halts Trains |journal=The PartyLine |issue=Number 78, Summer 2003 |publisher=[[Steamtown, Peterborough Railway Preservation Society]] |issn=1322-2473}}&lt;/ref&gt; The railway line was eventually removed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mannion, J |title=Ripping up the tracks - Eurelia to Peterborough |journal=Catchpoint Magazine |date=March 2009 |pages=14-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mills S "''Harvest time for the Eurelia rail line''"     [http://flindersranges.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/harvest-time-for-eurelia-rail-line/1276346.aspx Flinders News - 19 September 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120709151326/http://flindersranges.yourguide.com.au/news/local/news/general/harvest-time-for-eurelia-rail-line/1276346.aspx |date=9 July 2012 }} 10 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Road transport==
Orroroo is on the south-north [[RM Williams Way]] (route B80) connecting [[Clare, South Australia|Clare]] to [[Hawker, South Australia|Hawker]] and the west-east route B56 connecting the [[Port Augusta]] to [[Broken Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{google maps |url=https://www.google.com.au/maps/place/Orroroo+SA+5431/@-32.7302311,138.6143556,13z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x6abdd630112a2505:0x4033654628ed920?hl=en |title=Orroroo |accessdate=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the name "Orroroo"==
&lt;!-- This section heading is cross-referenced from § History --&gt;
"Orroroo" was officially named by a C.J. Easther, an early settler in the region. The ''Register'' of 16 November 1926 gives two still further alternatives, stating that Orroroo was the name of an Aboriginal girl who lived on nearby Pekina station, and that the town was for some reason named in honour of this girl, but also noting that others have suggested the name derivates from an Aboriginal word meaning 'dust', 'drift', or 'a windy locality'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |author=Manning, G|date=1990 |title=Mannings Place Names of South Australia |ISBN=}} {{Listed Invalid ISBN|05437687505}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is true that in the ''Advertiser'' of 9 January 1903, it is said that ''orroroo'' means ''wind'' in "the native language".&lt;ref&gt;''Advertiser'', 9 January 1903&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Advertiser'' of 15 August 1908, a still further derivation is suggested by a Gustav Degenhardt, who claims the name comes from the Aboriginal name for a nearby creek, ''Oorooroo''.&lt;ref&gt;Advertiser, 15 August 1908&lt;/ref&gt; Degenhardt resided in Orroroo from at least as early as 1880 (five years after Easther named the town), so it may be that he had first-hand knowledge of Easther's reasons for so naming the town.&lt;ref&gt;South Australian Government Gazette, 12 February 1880&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orroroo Fire Service==
The Orroroo [[Country Fire Service]] (CFS) is the volunteer fire service of Orroroo.  They are part of the Black Rock CFS Group.

'''''Road with Cypress and Star''''' ({{lang-nl|Cypres bij sterrennacht}}), also known as '''''Country Road in Provence by Night''''', is an 1890 oil-on-canvas painting by Dutch [[post-Impressionist]] painter [[Vincent van Gogh]]. It is the last painting he made in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]], France.{{sfn|Maurer|1998|p=106}}
The painting is part of the large van Gogh collection of the [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], located in the [[Hoge Veluwe National Park]] at [[Otterlo]] in the [[Netherlands]].

==Production and influences==
''Road with Cypress and Star'' was painted in May 1890.{{sfn|Erickson|1998|p=176}} In an earlier letter to his brother [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], van Gogh wrote that cypresses were "always occupying [his] thoughts" and that he found them "beautiful of line" and proportioned like an Egyptian obelisk.  He had also intended on painting a nighttime view of the trees since his stay in [[Arles]] in 1888.{{sfn|Welsh-Ovcharov|1987|p=55}}

Erickson suggests that the painting is influenced by the Christian allegory ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'', visible in the prominent road and [[cypress]] tree.{{sfn|Erickson|1998|p=160}} The painting is one of several in which van Gogh uses cypresses prominently, and — as in ''Road with Cypress and Star'' — many of the paintings depict trees that extend beyond the top of the canvas.{{sfn|Erickson|1998|p=172}} After finishing the work, in June 1890 while at [[Auvers-sur-Oise]], van Gogh wrote to his friend and fellow artist [[Paul Gauguin]] that the painting's themes are similar to those of Gauguin's work ''Christ in the Garden of Olives''.{{sfn|Maurer|1998|p=106}}

The orientation of the night sky objects may have been influenced by a conjunction of heavenly bodies on 20 April 1890, when Mercury and Venus were at 3 degrees of separation and together had luminescence comparable to [[Sirius]]. {{sfn|Boime|2008|p=2}}

==Analysis==
According to Kathleen Powers Erickson, ''Road with Cypress and Star'' more strongly reflects van Gogh's belief that he would soon die than the earlier painting ''[[The Starry Night]]''.{{sfn|Erickson|1998|p=176}} She supports this by comparing the evening star on the left of the painting, which is barely visible, to the emerging crescent moon on the right side; the cypress tree in the middle, which divides these symbols of the old and the new, is described as an "obelisk of death".{{sfn|Erickson|1998|p=176}} She finds the pair of travellers an indication of van Gogh's need for companionship.{{sfn|Erickson|1998|p=176}}

Naomi Maurer also writes that ''Road with Cypress and Star'' reflects the painter's feeling that he would soon die.{{sfn|Maurer|1998|p=106}}  She views the painting as depicting human life as being "in the context of infinity and eternity", with the two travellers and their journey dominated by the cypress in the centre.{{sfn|Maurer|1998|p=106}} The evening star and crescent moon on either side of the tree she describes as adding "cosmic perspective to the earthly scene" and suggesting a "sentient universe filled with love".{{sfn|Maurer|1998|p=106}}

'''Robert K. Heuberger''' (12 January 1922&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.winterthur-glossar.ch/app/default/pub/fw.action/wine.article?ce_id=345&amp;ce_name=person |title=Robert K. Heuberger, Immobilen-Unternehmer, *1922 |publisher=Winterthur Glossar |access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Olten]]) is a Swiss real estate entrepreneur, patron and author under the pseudonym '''Victor Vermont'''.

== Life and career ==
Heuberger grew up in poor circumstances. He completed his training at the [[Credit Suisse|Swiss Volksbank]] in [[Aarburg]] in the 1930s. As a bank and insurance buyer, he later worked for the Volksbank as an accountant, credit manager and securities specialist, then as an agency manager for the [[Bâloise]] insurance company.

Together with his wife Ruth, born Mötteli (* 1924, † 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.todesanzeigenportal.ch/todesanzeige/Ruth/Lina/Heuberger/M%C3%B6tteli/ |title=Trauerfall Heuberger Ruth Lina |date=9 October 2016 |publisher=Todesanzeigenportal Schweiz |access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heuberger founded Siska Heuberger Holding AG in 1954, with which he implemented a series of major building projects, especially in eastern Switzerland, with the construction of about 1000 apartments in [[Winterthur]]. According to the economic magazine's [[BILANZ]], he had assets of approximately CHF300 to 500 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nzz.ch/zuerich/aus-dem-leben-eines-tycoons-1.18223917 |title=Aus dem Leben eines Tycoons |author=Marc Tribelhorn |date=18 January 2014 |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the father of the media entrepreneur, Günther Heuberger, and father of Rainer Heuberger, old [[Cantonal Council of Zürich]] ([[Swiss People's Party|SVP]]) and owner of Siska Verwaltungs AG&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jungunternehmer-preis.ch/2013/dokumente/Berichterstattung_NZZaS_130623.pdf |title=Überschätze dich selbst! |author=Marco Metzler |date=23 June 2013 |publisher=Neue Zürcher Zeitung |access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Engagement ==
Heuberger's public commitment includes funding for the establishment of the [[Club of Rome]] in Winterthur, setting up the non-profit «Robert and Ruth Heuberger Foundation», as well as founding an innovation prize for young entrepreneurs. In 2007, the City of Winterthur awarded him the prize of the "Winterthur Lion". In 2013, Heuberger drew attention to the initiative to abolish conscription by means of double-page advertisements. The referendum was clearly rejected.

== Honors ==
The asteroid [[82232&amp;nbsp;Heuberger]], discovered by [[Markus Griesser (astronomer)|Markus Griesser]] at the Swiss [[Eschenberg Observatory]] in 2001, has been named in honor of Robert and Ruth Heuberger's commitment to social and cultural institutions.&lt;ref name="MPC-object" /&gt;  The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 13 July 2004 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 52327}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

[[File:The Hunt of the Unicorn Tapestry 1.jpg|thumb|270px|Tapestry 1, ''The Unicorn is Found'']]

'''''The Hunt of the Unicorn''''', or the '''''Unicorn Tapestries''''', is one of the most famous and spectacular but enigmatic survivors of the late Middle Ages. This series of seven [[tapestry|tapestries]] now in [[The Cloisters]] in New York was possibly made – or at least designed – in Paris at the turn of the sixteenth century. They are one of the canonical works of late medieval/early Renaissance art and show a group of noblemen and hunters in pursuit of a [[unicorn]] through an idealised French landscape. The tapestries were woven in wool, metallic threads, and silk. The vibrant colours, still evident today, were produced from dye plants: [[Reseda luteola|weld]] (yellow), [[Rose madder|madder]] (red), and [[woad]] (blue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicorn Tapestries|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Unicorn/unicorn_howcame.htm|website=www.MetMuseum.org|accessdate=2017-10-31|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507053309/https://www.metmuseum.org/explore/Unicorn/unicorn_howcame.htm|archivedate=2006-05-07|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

First recorded in 1680 in the Paris home of the [[Duc de la Rochefoucauld|de la Rochefoucauld]] family, the tapestries were looted at the French Revolution. Rediscovered in a barn in the 1850s, they were hung at the family's [[Château de Verteuil (Charente)|Château de Verteuil]]. Since then they have been the subject of intense scholarly debate about the meaning of their iconography, the identity of the artists who designed them, and the sequence in which they were meant to be hung. Although various theories have been put forward, as yet nothing is known of their early history or provenance, and their dramatic but conflicting narratives have inspired multiple readings, from chivalric to Christological. Variations in size, style, and composition suggest they come from more than one set, linked by their subject matter, provenance, and the mysterious AE monogram which appears in each. One of the panels, ''The Mystic Capture of the Unicorn'', only survives in two fragments.

[[James Rorimer|James J. Rorimer]] speculated in 1942 that the tapestries were commissioned by [[Anne of Brittany]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Unicorn Tapestries were made for Anne of Brittany |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257087.pdf.bannered.pdf|website=www.MetMuseum.org|accessdate=2017-12-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325125128/https://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3257087.pdf.bannered.pdf|archivedate=2017-03-25|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; to celebrate her marriage to [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]], King of France on 6 December 1491.&lt;ref name="mag"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/metpublications/tapestry_in_the_renaissance_art_and_magnificence|title=Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rorimer interpreted the A and E monogram that appears in each tapestry as the first and the last letters of Anne's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1983 |isbn=0-87099-147-7 |location=New York |pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret B. Freeman, however, rejected this interpretation in her 1976 monograph,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |first=Margaret B. |last=Freeman |date=1976 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art/Dutton |isbn= 0-525-22643-5 |pages=156 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a conclusion repeated by Adolph S. Cavallo in his 1998 work.&lt;ref name="ASC 21"&gt;{{cite book |page=21 |title=The Unicorn Tapestries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art |author=Adolph S. Cavallo |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |date=1998 |isbn=978-0-87099-868-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Campbell, former Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, recently acknowledged that experts "still do not know for whom or where [the tapestries] were made."  So far, scholarly efforts to explain the AE and other inscriptions, to identify the few heraldic symbols, and to coherently account for the puzzling narratives have met with limited success.

==Themes==
[[File:The Unicorn in Captivity - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|280px|''The Unicorn is in Captivity and No Longer Dead'']]
One theory is that the tapestries show [[paganism|pagan]] and Christian symbolism. The pagan themes emphasise the medieval lore of beguiled lovers, whereas Christian writings interpret the [[unicorn]] and its death as the [[Passion of Christ]]. The unicorn has long been identified by Christian writers as a symbol of Christ, conscripting the traditionally pagan symbolism of the unicorn. The original pagan myths about ''The Hunt of the Unicorn'' refer to an animal with a single horn that can only be tamed by a virgin; Christian scholars translated this into an allegory for Christ's relationship with the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]].

In the Gothic tapestry, the makers considered biblical events as "historical," and linked the biblical and secular narratives in the tapestry weaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=19}},&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval art illustrated moral principles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tapestries used narrative allegories to illustrate these morals. The secular unicorn hunt was not simply Christian art, but also an allegorical representation of the [[Annunciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Iconography of Christian Art |last=Schiller |first=Gertrud |publisher=Lund Humphries Publishers Limited |year=1971 |isbn=0-85331-270-2 |location=London |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Acknowledging Rorimer's speculation that the tapestries were commissioned to celebrate a marriage, Freeman noted that medieval poets connected the taming of the unicorn to the devotion and subjugation of love. The taming of the unicorn symbolises the secular lover or mate who was enchained by a virgin and entrapped in the fence (in the tapestry ''The Unicorn in Captivity''). In addition, the author pointed out that the concept of an overlapping God of Heaven and God of love was accepted in the late middle ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1983 |isbn=0-87099-147-7 |location=New York |pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The making of the tapestries ==
[[File:The hunt of the unicorn6.jpg|thumb|280px|Tapestry 6: ''The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle'']]
Questions about the original workmanship of the tapestries remain unanswered. The design of the tapestries is rich in figurative elements similar to those found in oil painting. Apparently influenced by the French style,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2|location=London|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; the elements in the tapestries reflect the woodcuts and metalcuts made in Paris in the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |date=1973–1973 |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |url= |journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |doi= |pmid= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The garden backgrounds of the tapestries are rich in floral imagery, featuring the "[[millefleur]]s" background style of a variety of small botanic elements. Invented by the weavers of the Gothic age, it became popular during the late medieval era and declined after the early Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than a hundred plants represented in the tapestries, scattered across the green backgrounds of the panels, eighty-five of which have been identified by botanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1983 |isbn=0-87099-147-7 |location=New York |pages=111}}&lt;/ref&gt; The particular flowers featured in the tapestries reflect the tapestries' major themes. In the unicorn series, the hunt takes place within a ''[[Hortus conclusus]]'', literally meaning "enclosed garden," which was not only a representation of a secular, physical garden, but a connection with the [[Annunciation]].
[[File:WLA metmuseum The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle.jpg|thumb|300px|''The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle'', detail]]

The tapestries were very probably woven in Brussels, which was an important center of the tapestry industry in medieval Europe. An example of the remarkable work of the Brussels looms, the tapestries' mixture of silk and metallic thread with wool gave them a fine quality and brilliant color. The wool was widely produced in the rural areas around Brussels, and a common primary material in tapestry weaving. The silk, however, was costly and hard to obtain, indicating the wealth and social status of the tapestry owner.

==Subjects==
The seven tapestries are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Flora of the unicorn tapestries |date=1947 |first1=E. J. |last1=Alexander |first2=Carol H. |last2=Woodward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# ''The Start of the Hunt''
# ''The Unicorn at the Fountain''
# ''The Unicorn Attacked''
# ''The Unicorn Defending Himself''
# ''The Unicorn Is Captured by the Virgin'' (two fragments)
# ''The Unicorn Killed and Brought to the Castle''
# ''The Unicorn in Captivity''
From the collection of Morgan and Rochefoucauld, the tapestries comprise five large pieces, one small piece, and two fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mobility associated with the size formed an essential consideration of the function of the tapestry in the medieval age and different sizes of Gothic tapestries served as the decoration to fit chosen walls in the middle age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The book of tapestry: history and technique |last=Pierre |first=Verlet |publisher=Octopus Books |year=1978 |isbn=0-7064-0961-2 |location=London |pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern research, based on the possibility that the unicorn tapestries were designed for use as a bedroom ensemble, the five large pieces fit the back area of wall, while the other two pieces serve as the coverlet, or overhead canopy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |date=2010 |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |url=|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources give slightly different titles and different sequences.  The factors that affect this are primarily threefold.  Firstly the nature of the tapestries themselves, which exhibit differences of manufacture and size, suggesting that the first and last may be independent works or form a different series. Secondly the nature of the classic stag hunt, usually cited to ''Livre de la Chasse'' by [[Gaston III, Count of Foix]].&lt;ref&gt;Bibliotheque National, Paris, Ms. fr. 616&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdly the established story of the unicorn hunt, where the unicorn is made docile by a virgin, and then captured, wounded or killed. In addition the symbolism of the story needs to be taken into account.

==Provenance==
The tapestries were owned by the [[Duc de La Rochefoucauld|La Rochefoucauld]] family of France for several centuries, with first mention of them showing up in the family's 1728 inventory.  At that time five of the tapestries were hanging in a bedroom in the family's [[Château de Verteuil, Charente]] and two were stored in a hall adjacent to the chapel.  The tapestries were highly believed woven for François, the son of Jean II de La Rochefoucauld and Marguerite de Barbezieux. And there was a possible connection between the letters A and E and the La Rochefoucauld, which are interpreted as the first and last of Antoine's name, who was the son of François, and his wife, Antoinette of Amboise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Freeman |first=Margaret B. |date=1973–1974 |title=The Unicorn Tapestries |url= |journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin |doi= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the French Revolution the tapestries were looted from the château and reportedly were used to cover potatoes – a period during which they apparently sustained damage.  By the end of the 1880s they were again in the possession of the family.  A visitor to the château described them as quaint 15th century wall hangings, yet showing "incomparable freshness and grace".  The same visitor records the set as consisting of seven pieces, though one was by that time in fragments and being used as bed curtains.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman (1973), 241&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]] bought them in 1922 for about one million US dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Preston|first=Richard|date=11 April 2005|title=Capturing the Unicorn|journal=[[The New Yorker]]|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/04/11/050411fa_fact|accessdate=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six of the tapestries hung in Rockefeller's house until [[The Cloisters]] was built when he donated them to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in 1938 and at the same time secured for the collection the two fragments the La Rochefauld family had retained. The set now hangs in [[The Cloisters]] which houses the museum's medieval collection.&lt;ref&gt;Cavallo, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
In 1998 the tapestries were cleaned and restored. In the process, the [[linen]] backing was removed, the tapestries were bathed in water, and it was discovered that the colours on the back were in even better condition than those on the front (which are also quite vivid). A series of high resolution [[digital photograph]]s were taken of both sides using a customised scanning device suspending a linear array scan camera and lighting over the delicate textile. The front and back of the tapestries were photographed in approximately three-foot square segments. The largest tapestry required up to 24 individual 5000 × 5000 pixel images. Merging the massive data stored in these photos required the efforts of two mathematicians, the [[Chudnovsky brothers]].

==Recreation==
[[Historic Scotland]] commissioned a set of seven hand-made tapestries for [[Stirling Castle]], a recreation of ''The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries'', as part of a project to furnish the castle as it was in the 16th century.  It was part-funded by the Quinque Foundation of the United States.[[File:Replica of 'The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle' tapestry, hanging in Mary of Guise's Inner Hall in the Royal Palace at Stirling Castle..JPG|thumb|''The Unicorn is Killed and Brought to the Castle'' tapestry, hanging in [[Mary of Guise]]'s Inner Hall in the Royal Palace at [[Stirling Castle]].]]

All seven currently hang in the Queen's Inner Hall in the Royal Palace.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stirlingcastle.gov.uk/tapestrystory|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111204235521/http://www.stirlingcastle.gov.uk/tapestrystory|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-12-04|title=The Stirling Tapestries|date=|accessdate=|website=Stirling Castle|publisher=|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tapestry project was managed by [[West Dean College]] in West Sussex and work began in January 2002. The weavers worked in two teams, one based at the college, the other in a purpose-built studio in the Nether Bailey of Stirling Castle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://singingweaver.blogspot.co.uk/2013_05_12_archive.html |title=Day Fourteen... |date=April 2013 |accessdate= |website=Singing Weaver |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first three tapestries were completed in Chichester, the remainder at Stirling Castle.

Historians studying the reign of [[James IV of Scotland|James IV]] believe that a similar series of "Unicorn" tapestries were part of the [[Scottish Royal tapestry collection]]. The team at West Dean Tapestry visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art to inspect the originals and researched the medieval techniques, the colour palette and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.westdean.org.uk/Tapestry/Showcase/HistoricScotland.aspx |accessdate=22 April 2009 |title=Historic Scotland |publisher=The Edward James Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional techniques and materials were used with [[mercerised cotton]] taking the place of silk to preserve its colour better.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The wool was specially dyed at West Dean College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/news/mediaresources/factsheets.htm#.UyrTdvl_vnh |title=Stirling Tapestries Factsheets |date= |accessdate= |website=Historic Scotland |publisher= |last= |first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4920">'''The Image Expedition''' is an American not-for-profit organization that produces multi-platform projects, which serve to photograph and document [[indigenous peoples|indigenous ways of life]] that are at risk of disappearing.&lt;ref&gt;John Ferri, [http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2000-11-23/calendar/good-grind/ Good Grind: The authors of The Birth of Coffee appear in West Palm Beach], ''[[New Times Broward-Palm Beach]]'', November 23, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Their projects use fine art photography, museum-quality exhibitions, digital video, websites, and explanatory text.

==Background==
The Image Expedition was founded in 1990 by [[Daniel Lorenzetti]], funded in part by a grant which Lorenzetti had recently been awarded by the South Florida Cultural Consortium's Visual Artist Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.trustedpartner.com/docs/library/000174/SFCC.pdf South Florida Cultural Consortium's list of past award recipients].&lt;/ref&gt; The editorial director of the Image Expedition is Daniel's wife, Linda Rice Lorenzetti, whose writing has been published in ''The Adventure of Food: True Stories of Eating Everything'' (Travelers' Tales, 1999),  and ''[[The Birth of Coffee]]'' (Random House, 2001).

The Image Expedition states that they are committed to respecting and not imposing upon the cultures that they visit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://imageexpedition.com/html/projects.htm Projects page on the Image Expedition website].&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Lorenzetti has said, "As Americans, we can't pretend to understand many of these people's lives.  We can only observe them."&lt;ref name="The Palm Beach Post 1998"&gt;"The Vanishing Cultures", Arts and Entertainment section of ''[[The Palm Beach Post]]'', May 31, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The main goal of the organization is to create 'visual artifacts' — "''words and images that document ancient sites, unusual occupations and traditional ways of life, many disappearing in the digital age.''"&lt;ref name="The Palm Beach Post 1998"/&gt; Examples of visual artifacts preserved by the Image Expedition range from cricket sellers in Beijing's public markets, to the Mingangkabau in Indonesia — one of the last existing matrilineal cultures, to duckherders in Burma, to public human cremation in Bali, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;''Collecting Visual Artifacts'', [[IX/Lighthouse Press]], 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
The Image Expedition's pilot project was a one-month trip to Ecuador in 1990, during which they documented diverse communities within the country, from the Andes mountains to the Amazon basin.  In 1995 the team traveled to document rural areas of China, Yemen, Cambodia, and Burma.  In 1996 the team spent two months photographing and gathering stories from Indonesia, specifically the islands of Bali, Java, Sumatra, Kalimatan and Sulawesi. All of the above research culminated in the publication of ''Collecting Visual Artifacts'', published by IX/Lighthouse Press in 1998.&lt;ref name="The Palm Beach Post 1998"/&gt;

Research for their second project, [[The Birth of Coffee]], began in 1996.&lt;ref name="The Palm Beach Post 1998"/&gt; The aim of this project is to help the average coffee-drinker to be aware of the difficult process that laborers must endure in order to grow and produce coffee.  A book of their findings from this expedition, ''[[The Birth of Coffee]]'', was published by [[Random House]] in 2001.

==Sponsors==
The Image Expedition's work has been made possible by donations from the following sponsors:
[[Continental Airlines]] (provides tickets), [[Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide|Starwood]]/[[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]] hotels (provides accommodations), Magellan (supplied GPS device), [[Olympus Corporation|Olympus]] America (supplies cameras), [[Ilford Photo|Ilford]] (supplies film and paper), [[Print File]] (donates photographic and archival supplies), [[Royal Robbins]] (supplies travel clothing), [[Imacon]] (supplies scanners), [[Winsor and Newton]] (supplies easels), [[Eagle Creek (company)|Eagle Creek]] (supplies luggage), [[Lonely Planet]] (supplies travel guides), and [[Dell]] (supplies laptops).&lt;ref&gt;[http://imageexpedition.com/html/sponsors.htm Sponsors page from the Image Expedition website].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
The Image Expedition's photographs are in the permanent collections of the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (London, England), the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] (Washington, D.C.), and the [[Santa Barbara Museum of Art]] (Santa Barbara, CA).

'''The Questors Theatre''' is a theatre venue located in the [[London Borough of Ealing]], west [[London]]. It is home of The Questors, a large theatre company which hosts a season of around twenty productions a year and is a member of the ''[[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]]'' and the ''[[International Amateur Theatre Association]]''.

==Activities==
The Questors theatre club was founded in 1929 by a group of 17 amateur performers and friends,&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; and – pursuing an adventurous artistic policy led by one of the founders, Alfred Emmet – has grown into a vibrant theatre company which in the 2013-14 season staged productions of 17 plays (drawing all actors and backstage teams from its membership), and 2 student productions.&lt;ref&gt;The Questors Annual Review 20013/14.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014 the company had 1,344 members (of whom about 300 were actors and about 200 worked backstage and front-of-house, with the remainder supporting the theatre as audience members).&lt;ref&gt;The Questors Annual Review 20013/14.&lt;/ref&gt; The company also runs Questors Academy which provides actor training and a youth theatre.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.questors.org.uk/academy (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site==
In 1964 The Questors completed the construction of a new theatre building, which was opened by [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother]] in April 1964, replacing the previous theatre building which had been converted from an old church. This new theatre's adaptable configuration was one of the first in a new wave of [[thrust stage]] theatres in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the opening, it was renamed the Judi Dench Playhouse.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2014/questors-theatre-building-renamed-judi-dench-playhouse/ (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The site also contains a studio theatre (the [[Constantin Stanislavski|Constantin Stanislavsky]] Room, built as a rehearsal room in 1960 and converted into a studio theatre in 1968), three rehearsal rooms (the [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] Room built in 1958; the [[Michael Redgrave]] Room, opened in 1968, converted from part of the original Mattock Lodge; and the Alfred Emmet Room built in 1998), a scenery workshop, and a members' bar (The Grapevine, opened in 1959, converted from part of Mattock Lodge).&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original building on the site, Mattock Lodge, is a house dating from the early 1850s, owned from around 1895 by Father O'Halloran who built a small church on the land behind the house, and on his death willed all the property to Miss Ann Webb as life tenant, who then lived in the house with her sister.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 The Questors theatre club, looking for a permanent venue, were invited to share the old church premises by the Ealing [[Boy Scout]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 The Questors took over as the sole users of the old church building and, following the death of Miss Webb, bought the freehold of the complete site on 25 April 1952 for £8,500.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

==New plays==
Throughout their history The Questors have regularly produced new plays, including an annual New Plays Festival from 1960 to 1977. They have staged three new plays by [[Rodney Ackland]] (''The Dark River'', 1943; ''The Diary of a Scoundrel'', adapted from Ostrovsky, 1946; and ''The Other Palace'', 1952), as well five new plays by [[James Saunders (playwright)|James Saunders]], four new plays by [[Dannie Abse]], four new plays by David Mowat, and new plays by [[David Storey]] (''Phoenix'', 1984) and [[Ruth Prawer Jhabvala]] (''Abode of Peace'', 1984).&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1964, The Questors presented six one-act plays at the Forum-Theatre, Berlin. One of these was ''Guildenstern &amp; Rosencrantz'' written and directed by [[Tom Stoppard]]. The cast included [[Peter Whelan]] as Guildenstern. The production was staged the following month at The Questors Theatre, and Stoppard subsequently expanded his one-act play into ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.questors.org.uk/prods/1964/berlinplays/page.html (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training==
The Questors established a Student Group in 1946 to train actors. Initially it was a one-year part-time course, but since 1949 has offered two years of part-time training, based on the acting techniques of [[Constantin Stanislavski]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; The Questors also run a large youth theatre (which in 2013-14 had about 460 members) and evening classes for beginner actors, and since 2012 have worked in partnership with the [[University of West London]] to provide a BA Hons course in Technical Theatre Production.&lt;ref&gt;The Questors Annual Review 20013/14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coarse acting==

Writer [[Michael Green (humorist)|Michael Green]] drew upon his experiences as an acting member of The Questors (from 1953) when he wrote his book ''[[The Art of Coarse Acting]]'' (published 1964) which he dedicated to The Questors.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972 The Questors hosted the ''World Coarse Acting Championship'', and then took ''The Coarse Acting Show'' to the 1977 [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] and ''The Coarse Acting Show 2'' to the 1979 Festival Fringe.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al. &amp; http://archive.questors.org.uk/index.html (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Coarse Acting Show 2'' subsequently transferred to the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]], [[London]], where it was visited by [[Charles, Prince of Wales|HRH The Prince of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 The Questors presented the ''Third Great Coarse Acting Show'' at The Questors Theatre (which was again visited by HRH The Prince of Wales), and in 1988 took ''Coarse Acting Strikes Back'' to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe.&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al. &amp; http://archive.questors.org.uk/index.html (retrieved 6 October 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidents==
Among those who accepted an invitation between 1930 and 1944 to serve as The Questors' Presidents were [[Robert Atkins (actor)|Robert Atkins]], Ion Swinley, [[Ben Webster (actor)|Ben Webster]], [[Gwen Ffrangcon-Davies]] and [[Margaret Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent presidents have been:&lt;ref&gt;Evans et al.&lt;/ref&gt;
*John Burrell (1944–52)
*[[Tyrone Guthrie]] (1952–58)
*[[Michael Redgrave]] (1958–85)
*[[Judi Dench]] (1985–present)

'''''The Raven''''' is a 2012 American [[psychological]] [[crime film|crime]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[James McTeigue]], produced by Marc D. Evans, Trevor Macy and Aaron Ryder and written by Ben Livingston and Hannah Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodtrailers.net/2010/10/luke-evans-and-alice-eve-in-james-mcteigue%E2%80%99s-the-raven "Luke Evans and Alice Eve in James McTeigue’s The Raven"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031155402/http://www.hollywoodtrailers.net/2010/10/luke-evans-and-alice-eve-in-james-mcteigue%E2%80%99s-the-raven/ |date=2010-10-31 }}. ''HollywoodTrailers.net''. Retrieved 2011-07-22.&lt;/ref&gt; It stars [[John Cusack]], [[Alice Eve]], [[Brendan Gleeson]] and [[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]].

Set in 1849,&lt;ref name="TheRaven2012film-r2" /&gt; it is a fictionalized account of the last days of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s life, in which the poet and author pursues a [[serial killer]] whose murders mirror those in Poe's stories. While the plot of the film is fictional, the writers based it on some accounts of real situations surrounding Edgar Allan Poe's mysterious death. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name "Reynolds" on the night before his death, though it is unclear to whom he was referring. The title derives from Poe's poem "[[The Raven]]", in the similar manner of the earlier unrelated [[The Raven (1935 film)|1935]] and [[The Raven (1963 film)|1963]] films.

It was released in [[Canada]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], and the [[United Kingdom]] on March 9, 2012 and in the [[United States]] on April 27, 2012. The film garnered mostly negative reviews, with the [[visual effects]] and [[Film score|score]] by [[Lucas Vidal]] praised, but the performances and [[Plot twist|plot twists]] criticized.

==Plot==
In 19th-century [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], several policemen discover a murdered woman sprawled on the floor of her apartment, which was locked from the inside. While police search for the killer's means of escape, they discover a second corpse in the chimney, later identified as the 12-year-old daughter of the first victim. A celebrated detective, Emmett Fields ([[Luke Evans (actor)|Luke Evans]]), is called to assist in the investigation and discovers that the crime resembles a fictional murder in a short story, "[[The Murders in the Rue Morgue]]", that he once read.

The writer Edgar Allan Poe ([[John Cusack]]) is brought to Fields for questioning. After finding the body of Griswold ([[John Warnaby]]), a rival of Poe, cut in half by a pendulum (as in Poe's story "[[The Pit and the Pendulum]]"), the pair deduce that someone is staging murders based on Poe's stories. Edgar's love, Emily Hamilton ([[Alice Eve]]), is kidnapped at her father's ([[Brendan Gleeson]]) masquerade ball, like the one described in Poe's "[[The Masque of the Red Death]]". The killer taunts Poe in a note, demanding that Edgar write and publish a new story. Poe's lodgings are burned down by people who believe he is exploiting the murders for his own journalistic ends, and he is forced to move in with Fields.

A clue from the killer referring to "[[The Cask of Amontillado]]" leads Poe and Fields to search the tunnels under the city with several policemen, discovering the walled-up corpse of a man dressed as Emily. The man is determined to be a sailor, and the clues on his body bring the pursuers to [[Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Holy Cross Church]], where an empty grave with Emily's name on it has been prepared. As the police attempt to break down the church doors, the killer attacks and kills one of the policemen, then shoots and wounds Fields. Poe gives chase on horseback, but the killer escapes.

Poe writes one last newspaper column, offering his life for Emily's, suggesting that he could take poison. In the morning, the maid gives Poe a letter from the killer, accepting his terms, but the note was delivered long before the paper was distributed. Realizing that the killer must work at the paper, Poe races to confront his editor, Henry ([[Kevin McNally]]), but Henry is already dead, another note lying next to him.

The real killer is the paper's typesetter, Ivan Reynolds ([[Sam Hazeldine]]), who congratulates Poe and offers him a drink. Ivan attempts to converse with Edgar, but Poe demands Emily's location. Ivan pours a vial of poison, promising to end the story as Poe had written it. Poe agrees and drinks the liquid. Ivan quotes "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]", cluing Edgar that Emily is concealed beneath the printing floor. As the killer leaves, Poe uses the last of his strength to tear up a false section of floor and open a trapdoor leading to Emily's prison.

Poe rescues Emily, and they share a poignant moment before she is taken away by ambulance. Delirious from the poison, Edgar wanders off to a park bench to die. A man walking in the park recognizes him as the famous writer, and asks if he is all right. Poe can summon only enough strength to say, "Tell Fields his last name is Reynolds." Later, when Fields comes to view Poe's corpse at the hospital, the attending physician is unable to tell him the exact cause of death, but mentions that the writer was incoherent, insisting that "his last name is Reynolds." Fields ponders the meaning of the phrase, slowly connecting the dots.

Ivan disembarks from a train in Paris. As a porter carries his luggage, Ivan climbs into a carriage and is confronted by Fields. He lunges for the detective, and Fields shoots him at point blank range.

[[James Berardinelli]] gave the film two and a half stars out of four, writing: "''The Raven'' looks great and is well-paced, but a lack of a compelling resolution makes it an anemic effort."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reelviews.net/php_review_template.php?identifier=2456 Raven, The] – Reelviews Movie Reviews&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote, "The story has its moments, and yet there is something about this tale ... that doesn't completely satisfy."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2012/04/26/DDTI1O9I9K.DTL {{"'}}The Raven' review: "Cusack inspired, movie isn't"] – ''San Francisco Chronicle''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Richard Roeper]], however, was more positive towards the film, awarding it a B+.

''The Raven'' brought back its budget(not accounting for marketing costs/budget) at the box office(although American cinema chains keep 46-50% of the final gross,whilst studios only receive 33-38%,depending on the film,from the final gross of the international gross) by grossing $29.65 million worldwide on a production budget of $26 million.

[[File:La Valse.jpg|thumb|''The Waltz'', a 1905 cast of the second version]]
'''''The Waltz''''' (French: ''La valse'') or '''''The Waltzers'''''  (French: ''Les valseurs'') is a sculpture by French artist [[Camille Claudel]].  It depicts two figures, a man and a woman, locked in an amorous embrace as they dance a [[waltz]]. The work was inspired by Claudel's burgeoning love affair with her mentor and employer [[Auguste Rodin]].  Various versions were made from 1889 to 1905, initially in modelled in plaster, and later cast in bronze.  Examples are held by the [[Musée Rodin]] and the [[Musée Camille Claudel]].

==Background==
Claudel was studying with [[Alfred Boucher]] in Paris when she was first introduced to Rodin in 1883, when she was aged 19.   She joined his studio around 1884, where she assisted him with ongoing works such as his ''[[Gates of Hell]]'' and ''[[Burghers of Calais]]''.  She also worked on her own sculptures under Rodin's guidance.  They quickly fell into a passionate romantic relationship. Claudel became increasingly frustrated with Rodin's unwillingness to break away from his long-term mistress, [[Rose Beuret]], and their love affair ended in 1892.  

Claudel and Rodin continued to work together until 1898, but their relationship deteriorated irretrievably after Rodin saw her transparently autobiographical sculpture ''[[The Mature Age]]'', which depicts a young woman pleading with her older lover to leave his female companion.

==Description==
Claudel began working on ''The Waltz'' in about 1889, while her relationship with Rodin was still passionate.  As originally conceived, the work depicts two naked dancers, a man and a woman, in a [[hold (dance)|dance hold]], frozen at a moment in time in their amorous embrace.  The woman's head rests tenderly on the man's right shoulder, with their bodies fluidly merging into a single shape as the man turns his head towards the woman's face as if to kiss her.  

Claudel continued to work on the subject for several years, eventually seeking a public commission to create a half-life-size marble version.  Her plaster model of the sculpture was reviewed in 1892 by the art critic [[Armand Dayot]], who was working as an inspector for the French [[Ministry of Beaux-Arts]].  In his report to the ministry, he praised the sensuality and expression of the work, and the modelling of the figures, but concluded that it was not acceptable for public display due to the indecency of the naked dancers.  

In response to Dayot's comments, Claudel reworked the sculpture, draping the lower half of the female figure with a flowing skirt which billows out with the twisting movement of the waltzing dancers, and curled around the dancer's heads.  Dayot reviewed the amended plaster model in 1893: he was impressed with the sense of movement added by the drapery, and supported the new work, known as ''La valse avec voiles'' ("The waltz with veils").  He described it as "un gracieux enlacement de  formes superbes balancées dans un rythme  harmonieux au milieu de l'enveloppement  tournoyant des draperies" ("a gracious intertwining of superb shapes balanced in an harmonious rhythm among swirling drapes"), concluding that Claudel was an artist with great talent.

Claudel exhibited this revised plaster model in 1893 at the [[Paris Salon]] of the [[Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts]], but the minister [[Henry Roujon]] deemed it unacceptable for a woman to be given a public commission which included a naked man.  Despite support from Rodin, the ministry declined to commission a marble version.

Emulating Rodin's reuse of figures from earlier sculptures in his later works, Claudel adapted the female figure from ''The Waltz'' as the figure of ''Fortune'' in her 1904 bronze cast.

==Casts==
The original plaster version was bought by the founder {{ill|Siot-Decauville|fr}} and in 1893 produced in a single bronze cast of this first version of ''The Waltz'', sometimes known as ''La  valse avec voiles''. 

Claudel worked on modified versions of ''The Waltz'' from 1895 to 1898, removing the drapery around the dancers' heads to make their faces visible.   Claudel made several versions of this modified sculpture, with slightly differing poses, and presented sculptures to several of her friends and acquaintances, including [[Claude Debussy]], [[Robert Godet]] and [[Frits Thaulow]].

The founder and art dealer {{ill|Eugène Blot|fr}} bought the rights to reproduce the sculpture from Siot-Decauville around 1902, and also bought the unique bronze cast of the first version.  Blot sold the this case, and it was held in a private collection in Sweden until the 1950, and then another collection until sold at [[Sotheby's]] in June 2013, for £5,122,500.  Blot also made bronze casts of the second version in 1905; he envisioned an edition of 50, but only 25 were made.

In addition to the bronzes, other examples exist, including a green-glazed [[stoneware]] version, one of four versions exhibited together at the [[Musée Camille Claudel]] at [[Nogent-sur-Seine]] near Paris

==Sales==
Several examples have been sold at auction in recent years, with prices increasing considerably.
* There were two sales of bronze casts of the second version at [[Christie's]] in New York in 2000, with one sale at $204,000 and the other at $281,000
* A cast of the second version sold at Christie's in London in 2011 for £724,450, one at Sotheby's in New York in May 2013 for $1.865 million, and one in Paris in 2014 for €829,500
* The only known cast of the first version was sold at Sotheby's in London in June 2013, for £5,122,500
* A small cast, described as a ''petit modèle'' of the second version, was sold at Sotheby's in New York in November 2013 for $869,000
* A cast, described as a ''grand modèle'' of the second version, was sold in London on 20 June 2018, with a pre-sale estimate of £700,000 to £900,000

The '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' ({{lang-ar|ضريح الجندي المجهول}}) is a [[war memorial]], dedicated to the [[Syrian]] soldiers killed during battle. It is visited every year by the [[President of Syria]] on [[Martyrs' Day (Syria)|Martyrs' Day]] (May 6).

The monument was designed by Prof. Dr. (Architecture) Abdo Kass-Hout and Prof. [[:ar:محمود حماد|Mahmoud Hammad]] who won a competition organized by the Syrian [[Ministry of Defense (Syria)|Ministry of Defense]]. Erected in 1985, the monument features a [[dome]], symbolizing the [[universe]], and an [[arch]], symbolizing victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=1245 Martyrs' Monument&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620021906/http://archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=1245 |date=2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a hall under the [[dome]], featuring five large paintings depicting battles from Arab and Syrian history: [[Battle of Yarmouk]] (636), [[Battle of Hattin]] (1187), [[Battle of Maysaloun]] (1920), [[First Battle of Mount Hermon|Battle of Mount Hermon]] (1973) and [[Battle of Sultan Yacoub]] (1982).&lt;ref name=mahmoud&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mahmoudhammad.com/graphics-2/|title=Monuments – Mahmoud Hammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two verses from the [[Quran]] are engraved into the structure:&lt;ref name=mahmoud/&gt;
{{quote|Think not of those who are slain in [[Allah|God]]'s Way as dead. Nay, they live, finding their sustenance in the Presence of their Lord; They rejoice in the Bounty provided by God: and with regard to those left behind, who have not yet joined them (in their bliss), the (Martyrs) glory in the fact that on them is no fear, nor have they (cause to) grieve.}}

'''''Two Sisters''''' or '''''On the Terrace''''' is an 1881 [[oil-on-canvas]] painting by French artist [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]]. The dimensions of the painting are 100.5&amp;nbsp;cm × 81&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="chicago1"&gt;{{cite web

Renoir worked on the painting on the terrace of the ''[[Maison Fournaise]]'', a restaurant located on an island in the [[Seine]] in [[Chatou]], the western suburb of [[Paris]]. The painting depicts a young woman and her younger sister seated outdoors with a small basket containing balls of wool. Over the railings of the terrace one can see shrubbery and foliage with the River Seine behind it.

In 1880 to 1881, shortly before working on ''Two Sisters'', Renoir worked in this particular location on another well-known painting, ''[[Luncheon of the Boating Party]]''.&lt;ref name="chicago1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hermitagemuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chicago2"&gt;{{cite web

Jeanne Darlot (1863—1914), a future actress who was 18 years old at the time, was posing as "the elder sister." It is unknown who posed as the "younger sister," but it is stated that the models were not actually related.&lt;ref name="hermitagemuseum" /&gt;

Renoir began work on the painting in April 1881 and on July 7, 1881, it was bought by the art dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel]], for 1,500 [[French franc|francs]].&lt;ref name="chicago1" /&gt; The painting was presented for the first time to the public at the 7th Impressionist exhibition in the spring of 1882.  In 1883 it was known to be in the collection of [[Charles Ephrussi]], an art collector and a publisher, but in 1892 the painting was returned again to the collection of the Durand-Ruel family.&lt;ref name="chicago1" /&gt;

In 1925, the painting was sold to [[Annie Swan Coburn]] from Chicago for $100,000. After her death in 1932 the painting was bequeathed to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], where it has remained since 1933.&lt;ref name="chicago1" /&gt;

The '''Venus effect''' is a phenomenon in the [[perception|psychology of perception]], named after various paintings of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] gazing into a [[mirror]], such as [[Diego Velázquez|Diego Velázquez's]] ''[[Rokeby Venus]]'', [[Titian]]'s ''[[Venus with a Mirror]]'', and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]'s ''Venus with a Mirror''. Viewers of such paintings assume that Venus is admiring her own reflection in the mirror; however, since the viewer sees her eyes in the mirror, Venus is actually looking at the reflection of the painter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This psychological effect is often used in the [[Cinematography|cinema]], where an [[actor]] will be shown apparently looking at himself or herself in the mirror. What viewers see is different from what the actor sees, because the camera is not right behind the actor, but the position of the actor is often chosen so that his or her image is nicely framed in the mirror for the camera.

Although the name of the effect refers to a woman, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], the effect is more general. The effect is seen with an animal apparently looking at itself in a mirror in [[La Dame à la Licorne|''The Lady and the Unicorn'' (French: ''La Dame à la licorne'')]] tapestries, where the unicorn appears to be gazing at its own reflection as it kneels on the ground.

Bertamini et al. (2010) conducted additional studies and confirmed that the Venus effect also occurs with photographs, and in real life when the person and the mirror are seen in a room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

'''Zainul Abedin''' (29 December 1914&amp;nbsp;– 28 May 1976) was a Bengali painter. He became well known in 1944 through his Famine Series paintings of 1943. After the partition of India and Pakistan he moved to Pakistan, and when Bangladesh was created in 1971, he was rightly considered by [[Syed Manzoorul Islam]] as the founding father of Bangladeshi [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Zainul Abedin |url=http://artist.christies.com/Zainul-Abedin-8989-bio.aspx |website=artist.christies.com |publisher=Christie's |accessdate=5 January 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017081445/http://artist.christies.com/Zainul-Abedin-8989-bio.aspx#loadProfileContent |archivedate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 he helped establish the Institute of Arts and Crafts (now [[Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Dhaka|Faculty of Fine Arts]]) at [[Dhaka University]].&lt;ref name="Alom193873"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Alom |first1=Zahangir |title=Homage to Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/event/homage-shilpacharya-zainul-abedin-193873 |accessdate=5 January 2016 |work=The Daily Star |date=29 December 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105153748/http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/event/homage-shilpacharya-zainul-abedin-193873 |archivedate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Indian Express]] described him as a Legendary Bangladeshi painter.&lt;ref name="indianexpress"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Sinha |first1=Nidhi |title=Celebrating the work of Bangladeshi painter and activist Zainul Abedin |url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/for-the-people-7/ |accessdate=5 January 2016 |work=The Indian Express|date=27 August 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140927084103/http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/life-style/for-the-people-7/ |archivedate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many of his contemporaries, his paintings on the [[Bengal famine of 1943]] is probably his most characteristic work.

==Early life and education==
Abedin was born in [[Kishoreganj]], [[East Bengal]] on 29 December 1914.&lt;ref name="star56215"&gt;{{cite news |title=Zainul Abedin's birth centenary event starts |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/zainul-abedins-birth-centenary-event-starts-56215 |accessdate=5 January 2016 |work=The Daily Star |date=20 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105161823/http://www.thedailystar.net/zainul-abedins-birth-centenary-event-starts-56215 |archivedate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his childhood was spent near the scenic banks of the [[Brahmaputra river]]. The Brahmaputra would later appear in many of his paintings and be a source of inspiration all throughout his career. Many of his works framed ''Brahmaputra'' and a series of watercolors that Abedin did as his tribute to the river earned him the Governor's Gold Medal in an all-India exhibition in 1938. This was the first time when he came under spotlight and this award gave Abedin the confidence to create his own visual style.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Manzoorul Islam |first=Syed |authorlink=Syed Manzoorul Islam |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A.|encyclopedia=Banglapedia |title=Abedin, Zainul |url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Abedin,_Zainul |date=16 June 2014 |edition=2nd |publisher=Asiatic Society of Bangladesh |location=Dhaka |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, Abedin was admitted to Calcutta Government Art School in [[Calcutta]]. Here for five years he learned British/ European academic style and later he joined the faculty of the same school after his graduation. He was the first Muslim student to obtain first class distinction from the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Islam |first1=Monwarul |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's birth centenary today |url=http://newagebd.net/81098/shilpacharya-zainul-abedins-birth-centenary-today/ |accessdate=5 January 2016 |work=New Age |date=29 December 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629091748/http://newagebd.net/81098/shilpacharya-zainul-abedins-birth-centenary-today/ |archivedate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was dissatisfied with the oriental style and the limitations of European academic style and this led him towards realism. He was the pioneer of the modern art movement that took place in Bangladesh. In 1948 he, with the help of few of his colleagues, founded an art institute in [[Dhaka]]. Back then, there were no art institutes present in Dhaka. It was considered the best art institute in [[Pakistan]] during its early years. He worked in the Pakistani government for a while.&lt;ref name="dawn776951"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/776951/portrait-of-an-artist-in-divided-south-asia |title=Portrait of an artist in divided South Asia |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|DAWN]] |location=Karachi |date=6 January 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105164034/http://www.dawn.com/news/776951/portrait-of-an-artist-in-divided-south-asia |archivedate=5 January 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He taught at the institute and among his students was Pakistani artist Mansur Rahi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Chatterjee |first=Partha |url=http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl2624/stories/20091204262408800.htm |title=Gentle rainbow |work=Frontline |date=4 December 2009 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also taught Bangladeshi artist [[Mohammad Kibria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Haq |first=Fayza |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2011/07/01/feature.htm |title="To sir, with love"– Kibria: Immortal in our hearts |location=Dhaka |work=The Daily Star |date=1 July 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131027092104/http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2011/07/01/feature.htm |archivedate=27 October 2013 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his two years of training from an art school in London, he began a new style, the "Bengali style", where the main features were: folk forms with their geometric shapes, sometimes semi-abstract representation, and the use of primary colors. But he lacked the sense of perspective. Later he realized the limitations of folk art, so he went back to the nature, rural life and the daily struggles of man to make art that would be realistic but modern in appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/shilpacharya-zainul-abedins-39th-death-anniversary/ |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's 39th death anniversary |work=Dhaka Courier |location=Dhaka |date=4 June 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110030628/http://www.dhakacourier.com.bd/shilpacharya-zainul-abedins-39th-death-anniversary/ |archivedate=10 January 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newagebd.net/80948/museum-displays-100-artworks-of-shilpacharya/ |title=Museum displays 100 artworks of Shilpacharya |work=[[New Age (Bangladesh)|New Age]] |location=Dhaka |date=29 December 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110171127/http://newagebd.net/80948/museum-displays-100-artworks-of-shilpacharya/ |archivedate=10 January 2016 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paintings==
[[Image:Jainul Abedin Museum.jpg|right|thumb|Jainul Abedin Gallary]]

Among all the contemporary works of Abedin, his famine sketches of the 1940s are his most remarkable works. He created his famine painting set, which, when exhibited in 1944, brought him even more critical acclaim. The miserable situation of the starving people during the Great Famine of Bengal in 1943 touched his heart. He made his own ink by burning charcoal and used it on cheap, ordinary packing paper. He depicted those starving people who were dying by the road-side.&lt;ref name="Alom193873"/&gt; Abedin not only documented the famine, he also revealed the famine's sinister face through the skeletal figures of people fated to die of starvation.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Alom |first=Zahangir |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/fine-art-and-artists-through-the-eyes-of-fayza-haq-50833 |title=Fine art and artists through the eyes of Fayza Haq |work=The Daily Star |location=Dhaka |date=18 November 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208130702/http://www.thedailystar.net/fine-art-and-artists-through-the-eyes-of-fayza-haq-50833 |archivedate=8 February 2015 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abedin depicted this inhuman story with very human emotions. These drawings became iconic images of human suffering. These sketches helped him find his way in a realistic approach that focused on the human suffering, struggle and protest. He was more socially aware focusing on the working class and their struggles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wepk/hd_wepk.htm |title=Modern Art in West and East Pakistan |last=Ali |first=Atteqa |work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151231082924/http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/wepk/hd_wepk.htm |archivedate=31 December 2015 |accessdate=10 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Rebel Cow marks a high point of that style. This particular brand of realism combines social inquiry and the protest with higher aesthetics. He was an influential member of the [[Calcutta Group]] of progressive artists and was friends with [[Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy|Shahid Suhrawardy]] and [[Ahmed Ali (writer)|Ahmed Ali]] of the [[Progressive Writers' Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=236059 |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's 36th death anniversary observed |work=he Daily Star |location=Dhaka |date=29 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105174730/http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=236059 |archivedate=5 January 2016 |accessdate=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He made modernist paintings of [[Santhal people]]. Notable among them is "Two Santhal Women".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bhasin |first=Tanushree |url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/artbeat/south-asias-organic-brand-of-modernism |title=South Asia's organic brand of Modernism |work=Sunday Guardian |date=7 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105231610/http://www.sunday-guardian.com/artbeat/south-asias-organic-brand-of-modernism |archivedate=5 November 2013 |accessdate=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He visited Palestinian camps in Syria and Jordan in 1970 and made 60–70 paintings of the refugees there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Zaman |first=Mustafa |url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/12/04/cover.htm |title=The Artist of People's Struggle |work=Star Weekend Magazine |location=Dhaka |date=24 December 2004 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105174419/http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/12/04/cover.htm |archivedate=5 January 2016 |accessdate=5 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also painted the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]] that devastated the then East Pakistan.&lt;ref name="dawn776951"/&gt;

==Liberation movement==
[[Image:Joynul Tomb.A.M.R.jpg|thumb|Abedin's tomb]]
He was involved in the [[Bengali Language Movement]] of East Pakistan.&lt;ref name="indianexpress"/&gt; Abedin was involved in the [[Bangladesh liberation war]] movement. He was at the forefront of the cultural movement to re-establish the [[Bengal]]i identity, marginalized by the [[Pakistan]] government. In 1969, Abedin painted a scroll using [[Chinese ink]], watercolor and wax named [[Nabanna (painting)|Nabanna]]. This was to celebrate the ongoing non-cooperation movement.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Post-independence era==
In 1974 he received Honorary [[Doctor of Letters]] degree from the [[University of Delhi]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/mad-genius/zainul-abedin-157657 |title=Zainul Abedin |work=[[The Daily Star (Bangladesh)|The Daily Star]] |location=Dhaka |date=16 October 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160118081856/http://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/mad-genius/zainul-abedin-157657 |archivedate=18 January 2016 |accessdate=18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, he founded the Folk Art Museum at [[Sonargaon]] in [[Narayanganj]], and Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala, a gallery of his own works in [[Mymensingh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/entertainment/2013/dec/28/shilpacharya-zainul-abedin%E2%80%99s-100th-birthday-today |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's 100th birthday today |work=[[Dhaka Tribune]] |location=Dhaka |date=28 December 2013 |accessdate=18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, 17 of the 70 pictures housed in Zainul Abedin Sangrahashala were stolen. Only 10 were later recovered. His famous painting "Study of a Crow" (Ink Wash) in the collection of Professor Ahmed Ali is listed in the book 'Arts in Pakistan" by Jalaluddin Ahmed, 1952, including an exclusive monologue on him published by FOMMA, [[Karachi]], along with his many Famine Series paintings of 1943.

==Personal life and death==

Abedin was married to Jahanara Abedin.&lt;ref name="star56215"/&gt; He developed lung cancer and died on 28 May 1976 in Dhaka. ''Two faces'' was his last painting, completed shortly before his death.&lt;ref name="Alom193873"/&gt; He was buried beside the Dhaka University Central Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/28382 |title=Shilpacharya Zainul Abedin's birth centenary today|work=[[The Independent (Bangladesh)|The Independent]] |location=Dhaka |date=29 December 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105180040/http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/28382 |archivedate=5 January 2016 |accessdate=18 January 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3787">'''Isabelle Anna "Ziggy" Lorenc''' (pronounced "LAWR-ence") (born December 28, 1958 in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]) is a [[Canada|Canadian]] television and radio personality as well as occasional actress in film and television, best known for hosting programming on [[Citytv]], [[MuchMusic]] and [[Bravo! (Canada)|Bravo!]] after working for CHUMCity as a receptionist.

==Career==
Having done modelling work since the age of thirteen, Lorenc began pursuing acting jobs during her late teens. Hanging around aspiring performers in Toronto in the late 1970s, a group that included [[Michael Wincott]], [[Kim Cattrall]], [[Jim Carrey]], [[Tonya Lee Williams]], etc., Lorenc too went to the U.S., getting accepted at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre]] in [[New York City]] following an audition of sorts that consisted of the school's director [[Sanford Meisner]] just speaking to the applicants.&lt;ref name="torontomike-jun2017"&gt;{{cite news|last=Boon|first=Mike|url=http://www.torontomike.com/2017/06/toronto_miked_podcast_episode_248.html|title=Toronto Mike'd Podcast Episode 248: Ziggy Lorenc|agency=TorontoMike.com|date=30 June 2017|accessdate=11 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her stay in New York turned out to be short, however, as she returned home to Toronto due to being unable to support herself financially in New York. 

Continuing to look for work as character actress in Toronto without much success, she worked various jobs including disco bunny at Toronto night clubs that got her an appearance on ''Boogie'', [[CITY-DT|Citytv]]'s disco local counterpart to [[Dick Clark]]'s ''[[American Bandstand]]''. She soon met Citytv producer and creative director [[Moses Znaimer]], eventually getting a job at the station as a switchboard operator.&lt;ref name="torontomike-jun2017"/&gt;

===Citytv===
In parallel with working the switchboard at Citytv's 99 [[Queen Street East]] headquarters, Lorenc became part of the Switchettes — a group of young female office staffers the station sent around the city of Toronto for promotional activities and even human interest reporting.

She continued going to acting auditions and soon got a part on the Canadian sketch comedy series ''[[Bizarre (TV series)|Bizarre]]'' being shot in Toronto. Asking for time off from her Citytv duties in order to do ''Bizarre'', she got rejected eventually and left Citytv. Her time on ''Bizarre'' was short, however, as she got fired after a couple of episodes.&lt;ref name="torontomike-jun2017"/&gt;

Without both jobs, Lorenc began waitressing at night at Bemelmans, a popular Toronto eatery, while going to acting auditions during the day. She soon got cast as one of the romantic leads in ''[[Copper Mountain (film)|Copper Mountain]]'', a 1983 comedy that was never completed though still got a limited video release, starring young comedian [[Jim Carrey]] and [[Alan Thicke]].&lt;ref name="torontomike-jun2017"/&gt;

By 1984 she was back in the Citytv fold and was on hand during the launch of [[Much Music]].

Lorenc was also the star/host of the series ''[[Life on Venus Ave.]]'' She is currently heard on [[CFZM]], hosting a late night program devoted to romantic music.

She also had roles in movies ''[[White Room (film)|White Room]]'' and ''[[Love, Sex and Eating the Bones]]''.
