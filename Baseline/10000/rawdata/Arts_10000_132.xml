The year '''1965 in film''' involved some significant events, with ''[[The Sound of Music]]'' topping the U.S. box office.

==Events==
* February 15 - [[George Stevens]]' production of ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'', a retelling of the account of [[Jesus Christ]], premieres in [[New York City, New York]]. It was such a flop with critics and audiences that its failure discouraged production of religious epics for many years. It is considered notable in the 21st century for its astonishing landscapes, powerful and provocative cinematography, [[Max von Sydow]]'s debut acting performance in an American film, and the final film performance of [[Claude Rains]].
* March 2 - The [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] film adaptation of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', directed by [[Robert Wise]] and starring [[Julie Andrews]] and [[Christopher Plummer]], premieres. It quickly became a worldwide phenomenon and an instant classic. It successfully displaced ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' to become, at the time, [[List of highest-grossing films in Canada and the United States#Adjusted for ticket-price inflation|the highest-grossing film of all-time]]. ''The Sound of Music'' is credited as the film that saved and restored [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] from bankruptcy after it suffered from extremely high production costs and low revenue of ''[[Cleopatra (1963 film)|Cleopatra]]'' two years prior.
* July 1 - [[Blake Edwards]]'s epic comedy ''[[The Great Race]],'' starring [[Tony Curtis]], [[Jack Lemmon]], [[Natalie Wood]], [[Peter Falk]], and [[Keenan Wynn]], premieres. Initially a flop with critics and audiences, some do admire Edwards' direction, the acting by its ensemble cast, [[Henry Mancini]]'s music and its climactic pie fight.
* December 22 - [[David Lean]]'s film adaptation of [[Boris Pasternak]]'s ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'', starring [[Omar Sharif]], [[Julie Christie]], [[Rod Steiger]], and [[Alec Guinness]], premieres and, like ''The Sound of Music'', quickly became a worldwide phenomenon. Its moral story and message of a love and human spirit that defied the communist Soviet Union have made the film a true classic with critics and audiences. It was included among top films by the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|American Film Institute]]. In a decade of very difficult times for its studio, ''Zhivago'' became the most successful and acclaimed [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] film since ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]];'' it was the greatest MGM film since ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]''.

'''Amate''' ({{lang-es|amate}} {{IPA-es|aˈmate|}} from {{lang-nah|āmatl}} {{IPA-nah|ˈaːmat͡ɬ|}}) is a type of bark [[paper]] that has been manufactured in [[Mexico]] since the [[Mesoamerican chronology|precontact times]]. It was used primarily to [[Maya codices|create codices]].

Amate paper was extensively produced and used for both communication, records, and ritual during the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]]; however, after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]], its production was mostly banned and replaced by European paper. Amate paper production never completely died, nor did the rituals associated with it. It remained strongest in the rugged, remote mountainous areas of northern [[Puebla]] and northern [[Veracruz]] states. Spiritual leaders in the small village of [[San Pablito, Puebla]] were described as producing paper with "magical" properties. Foreign academics began studying this ritual use of amate in the mid-20th century, and the [[Otomi people]] of the area began producing the paper commercially. Otomi craftspeople began selling it in cities such as [[Mexico City]], where the paper was revived by [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] painters in [[Guerrero]] to create "new" indigenous craft, which was then promoted by the Mexican government.

Through this and other innovations, amate paper is one of the most widely available [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexican indigenous handicrafts]], sold both nationally and abroad. Nahua paintings of the paper, which is also called "amate," receive the most attention, but Otomi paper makers have also received attention not only for the paper itself but for crafts made with it such as elaborate [[Papercutting|cut-outs]].

==History==
Amate [[paper]] has a long history. This history is not only because the raw materials for its manufacture have persisted but also that the manufacture, distribution and uses have adapted to the needs and restrictions of various epochs. This history can be roughly divided into three periods: the pre-Hispanic period, the Spanish colonial period to the 20th century, and from the latter 20th century to the present, marked by the paper's use as a commodity.&lt;ref name="lopez808"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 8, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Hispanic period===

The development of paper in [[Mesoamerica]] parallels that of China and Egypt, which used rice and [[papyrus]] respectively.&lt;ref name="curativo"&gt;{{cite news |title= Papel amate, arte curativo |author= Lizeth Gómez De Anda  |url= http://www.razon.com.mx/spip.php?article29277 |newspaper= La Razón |location=Mexico City |date=September 30, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Amate paper, curative art }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not known exactly where or when [[papermaking]] began in Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="lopez0207"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 2-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="chicontepec"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=661 |title=El Papel Amate Entre los Nahuas de Chicontepec |publisher=Universidad Veracruzana |location=Veracruz, Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Amate paper among the Nahuas of Chicontepec |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309150849/http://www.uv.mx/popularte/esp/scriptphp.php?sid=661 |archivedate=March 9, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known amate paper dates back to 75 CE. It was discovered at the site of [[Huitzilapa]], Jalisco. Huitzilapa is a [[shaft tomb culture]] site located northwest of [[Tequila Volcano]] near the town of [[Magdalena Municipality, Jalisco|Magdalena]]. The crumpled piece of paper was found in the southern chamber of the site's shaft tomb, possibly associated with a male scribe. Rather than being produced from ''[[Trema micrantha]]'', from which modern amate is made, the amate found at Huitzilapa is made from ''[[Ficus tecolutensis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Benz et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Iconography (in stone) dating from the period contains depictions of items thought to be paper. For example, Monument 52 from the [[Olmec]] site of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán]] illustrates an individual adorned with ear pennants of folded paper.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;Miller and Taube (1993, p. 131)&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known surviving book made from amate paper may be the [[Grolier Codex]], which [[Michael D. Coe]] and other researchers have asserted is authentic and dated to the 12th-13th century CE.&lt;ref name="newitz ars technica"&gt;Annalee Newitz (12 September 2016). "[https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/confirmed-mysterious-ancient-maya-book-grolier-codex-is-genuine/ Confirmed: Mysterious ancient Maya book, Grolier Codex, is genuine: 900 year-old astronomy guide is oldest known book written in the Americas]." ''[http://arstechnica.co.uk/ Ars Technica]''. Accessed 12 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguments from the 1940s to the 1970s have centered on a time of 300 CE of the use of bark clothing by the Maya people. Ethnolinguistic studies lead to the names of two villages in Maya territory that relate the use of bark paper, Excachaché ("place where white bark trusses are smoothed") and Yokzachuún ("over the white paper"). Anthropologist Marion mentions that in [[Lacandones Region|Lacandones]], in [[Chiapas]], the Maya were still manufacturing and using bark clothing in the 1980s. For these reason, it was probably the Maya who first propagated knowledge about bark-paper-making and spread it throughout southern Mexico, [[Guatemala]], [[Belize]], [[Honduras]], and [[El Salvador]], when it was at its height in the pre-classic period.&lt;ref name="lopez81"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 81&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="papiro"&gt;{{cite journal |date=May 2008 |title= Amate y Papiro… un diálogo histórico |trans-title=Amate and Papyrus… a historic dialogue |journal= National Geographic en español |language=Spanish |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |url= http://ngenespanol.com/2008/05/amate-y-papiro%E2%80%A6-un-dialogo-historico-2/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according researcher [[Hans Lenz]], this Maya paper was likely not the amate paper known in later Mesoamerica.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; The [[Mayan language]] word for book is ''hun'' {{IPA-myn|hun|}}.&lt;ref name="boot" &gt;Boot, E. (2002). ''[http://www.mesoweb.com/resources/vocabulary/vocabulary.pdf A Preliminary Classic Maya-English / English-Classic Maya Vocabulary of Hieroglyphic Readings]''. Leiden University, the Netherlands. Retrieved September 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Amate paper was used most extensively during the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Triple Alliance]] Empire.&lt;ref name="lopez80"&gt;López Binnqüist, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was manufactured in over 40 villages in territory controlled by the [[Aztecs]] and then handed over as tribute by the conquered peoples. This amounted to about 480,000 sheets annually. Most of the production was concentrated in the modern state of [[Morelos]], where [[Ficus]] trees are abundant because of the climate.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez90"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 90&lt;/ref&gt; This paper was assigned to the royal sector, to be used as gifts on special occasions or as rewards for warriors. It was also sent to the religious elites for ritual purposes. The last share was allotted to royal scribes for the writing of codices and other records.&lt;ref name="lopez89"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known about the paper's manufacture in the pre-Hispanic period. Stone beaters dating from the 6th century CE have been found, and these tools are most often found where amate trees grow. Most are made of volcanic stone with some made of marble and granite. They are usually rectangular or circular with grooves on one or both sides to macerate the fibers. These beaters are still used by [[Otomi people|Otomi]] artisans, and almost all are volcanic, with an additional groove added on the side to help hold the stone. According to some early Spanish accounts, the bark was left overnight in water to soak, after which the finer inner fibers were separated from coarser outer fibers and pounded into flat sheets. But it is not known who did the work, or how the labor was divided.&lt;ref name="lopez121122"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 121–122&lt;/ref&gt;

As a tribute item, amate was assigned to the royal sector because it was not considered to be a commodity. This paper was related to power and religion, the way through which the [[Aztec]]s imposed and justified their dominance in Mesoamerica. As tribute, it represented a transaction between the dominant groups and the dominated villages. In the second phase, the paper used by the royal authorities and priests for sacred and political purposes was a way to empower and frequently register all the other sumptuary exclusive things.&lt;ref name="lopez115"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Amate paper was created as part of a line of technologies to satisfy the human need to express and communicate. It was preceded by stone, clay and leather to transmit knowledge first in the form of pictures, and later with the [[Olmec]]s and Maya through a form of [[Maya script|hieroglyphic writing]].&lt;ref name="lopez81"/&gt; Bark paper had important advantages as it is easier to obtain than animal skins and was easier to work than other fibers. It could be bent, shirred, glued and melded for specific finishing touches and for decoration. Two more advantages stimulated the extensive use of bark paper: its light weight and its ease of transport, which translated into great savings in time, space and labor when compared with other raw materials.&lt;ref name="lopez83"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 83&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aztec era, paper retained its importance as a writing surface, especially in the production of chronicles and the keeping of records such as inventories and accounting. Codices were converted into "books" by folding into an accordion pattern. Of the approximately 500 surviving codices, about 16 date to before the conquest and are made of bark paper. These include the [[Dresden Codex]] from the Yucatán, the [[Codex Fejérváry-Mayer|Fejérváry-Mayer Codex]] from the [[Mixteca]] region and the [[Borgia Codex]] from [[Oaxaca]].&lt;ref name="lopez84"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

However, paper also had a sacred aspect and was used in rituals along with other items such as incense, [[copal]], [[Agave americana|maguey]] thorns and rubber.&lt;ref name="lopez84"/&gt; For ceremonial and religious events, bark paper was used in various ways: as decorations used in fertility rituals, yiataztli, a kind of bag, and as an amatetéuitl, a badge used to symbolize a prisoner's soul after sacrifice. It was also used to dress idols, priests and sacrifice victims in forms of crowns, stoles, plumes, wigs, trusses and bracelets. Paper items such as flags, skeletons and very long papers, up to the length of a man, were used as offerings, often by burning them.&lt;ref name="lopez86"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 86&lt;/ref&gt; Another important paper item for rituals was paper cut in the form of long flags or trapezoids and painted with black rubber spots to depict the characteristic of the god being honored. At a certain time of year, these were also used to ask for rain. At this time, the papers were colored blue with plumage at the spearhead.&lt;ref name="lopez87"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 87&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period to 20th century===
When the Spanish arrived, they noted the production of codices and paper, which was also made from maguey and palm fibers as well as bark. It was specifically noted by Pedro Mártir de Anglería.&lt;ref name="lopez82"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 82&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]], indigenous paper, especially bark paper lost its value as a tribute item not only because the Spanish preferred European paper but also because bark paper's connection to indigenous religion caused it to be banned.&lt;ref name="lopez90"/&gt; The justification for the banning of amate was that it was used for magic and witchcraft.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; This was part of the Spaniard's efforts to mass convert the indigenous to Catholicism, which included the mass burning of codices, which contained most of the native history as well as cultural and natural knowledge.&lt;ref name=lopez80/&gt;

Only 16 of 500 surviving codices were written before the Conquest. The other, post-conquest books were written on bark paper although a few were written on European paper, cotton, or animal hides. They were largely the work of missionaries, such as [[Bernardino de Sahagún]], who were interested in recording the history and knowledge of the indigenous people. Some of the important codices of this type include [[Codex Sierra]], [[Libellus de Medicinalibus Indorum Herbis|Codex La Cruz Badiano]] and [[Codex Florentino]]. The [[Codex Mendoza|Codex Mendocino]] was commissioned by viceroy [[Antonio de Mendoza]] in 1525 to learn about the tribute system and other indigenous practices to be adapted to Spanish rule. However, it is on European paper.&lt;ref name="lopez9192"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 91-92&lt;/ref&gt;

Although bark paper was banned, it did not completely disappear. In the early colonial period, there was a shortage of European paper, which made it necessary to use the indigenous version on occasion.&lt;ref name="lopez9192"/&gt; During the evangelization process, amate, along with a paste made from corn canes was appropriated by missionaries to create Christian images, mostly in the 16th and 17th century.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tierra"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/el-papel-de-la-tierra-en-el-tiempo.html |author=Beatriz M. Oliver Vega |title= El papel de la tierra en el tiempo |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title="Earth" paper over time |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, among the indigenous, paper continued to be made clandestinely for ritual purposes. In 1569, friar Diego de Mendoza observed several indigenous carrying offerings of paper, copal and woven mats to the lakes inside the [[Nevado de Toluca]] volcano as offerings.&lt;ref name="tierra"/&gt; The most successful at keeping paper making traditions alive were certain indigenous groups living in the [[La Huasteca]], [[Ixhuatlán del Café, Veracruz|Ixhuatlán]] and [[Chicontepec de Tejada|Chicontepec]] in the north of Veracruz and some villages in Hidalgo. The only records of bark paper making after the early 1800s refer to these areas.&lt;ref name="lopez80"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez9394"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 93-94&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these areas are dominated by the Otomi and the area's ruggedness and isolation from central Spanish authority allowed small villages to keep small quantities of paper in production. In fact, this clandestine nature helped it to survive as a way to defy Spanish culture and reaffirm identity.&lt;ref name="lopez115"/&gt;

===Latter 20th century to the present===
[[File:Aztec calendar on Amate.jpg|thumb|The [[Aztec calendar stone]] painted on amate]]
[[File:CitlalliArreguinGarros02.jpg|thumb|Painting on amate by Citlalli Arreguín in an exhibit at [[Garros Galería]], Mexico City]]
By the mid-20th century, the knowledge of making amate paper was kept alive only in a few small towns in the rugged mountains of Puebla and Veracruz states, such as San Pablito, an Otomi village and Chicontepec, a Nahua village.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez94"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; It was particularly strong in San Pablito in Puebla as many of the villages around it believed this paper has special power when used in rituals.&lt;ref name="lopez9497"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 94-97&lt;/ref&gt; The making of paper here until the 1960s was strictly the purview of the [[shaman]]s, who kept the process secret, making paper primarily to be used for cutting gods and other figures for ritual. However, these shamans came into contact with anthropologists, learning of the interest that people on the outside had for their paper and their culture.&lt;ref name="lopez104"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 104&lt;/ref&gt; But although the ritual cutting of paper remained important for the Otomi people of northern Puebla, the use of amate paper was declining, with industrial paper or tissue paper replacing amate paper in rituals.&lt;ref name="lopez103115105"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 103, 115, 105&lt;/ref&gt; One stimulus for amate's commercialization was the shamans' growing realization of the commercial value of the paper; they began to sell cutouts of bark paper figures on a small scale in Mexico City along with other Otomi handcrafts.&lt;ref name="lopez104"/&gt;

What the sale of these figures did was to make the bark paper a commodity. The paper was not sacred until and unless a shaman cut it as part of a ritual. The making of the paper and non ritualistic cutting did not interfere with the ritual aspects of paper in general. This allowed a product formerly reserved only for ritual to become something with market value as well. It also allowed the making of paper to become open to the population of San Pablito and not only to shamans.&lt;ref name="lopez10311580"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 103, 115, 80&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most amate paper is sold as the backing for paintings made by [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] artists from [[Guerrero]] state. There are various stories as to how painting on bark paper came about but they are divided between whether it was a Nahua or an Otomi idea. However, it is known that both Nahua and Otomi sold crafts at the Bazar del Sábado in [[San Ángel]] in [[Mexico City]] in the 1960s. The Otomi were selling paper and other crafts and the Nahua were selling their traditionally painted pottery.&lt;ref name="lopez106"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="extinguirse"&gt;{{cite news |title= A punto de extinguirse, el árbol del amate en San Pablito Pahuatlán: Libertad Mora |author= Tania Damián Jiménez |url= http://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/2010/10/13/puebla/eco304.ph|newspaper= La Jornada del Orienta |location=Puebla |date=October 13, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=A the point of extinction:the amate árbol in San Pablio Pahuatlán:Libertad Mora }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nahua transferred many of their pottery painting designs onto amate paper, which is easier to transport and sell.&lt;ref name="lopez105"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 105&lt;/ref&gt; The Nahua called the paintings by their word for bark paper, which is "amatl." Today, the word is applied to all crafts which use the paper. The new painting form found great demand from the start, and at first, the Nahua would buy almost all of the Otomi's paper production. Painting on bark paper quickly spread to various villages in Guerrero and by the end of the 1960s, became the most important economic activity in eight Nahua villages [[Ameyaltepec]], [[Oapan]], [[Ahuahuapan]], [[Ahuelican]], [[Analco]], [[San Juan Tetelcingo]], [[Xalitla]] and [[Maxela]]. (page 106)  Each Nahua village has its own painting styles developed from the tradition of painting ceramics, and this allowed works to be classified.&lt;ref name="lopez105" /&gt;

The rise of amate paper occurred during a time when government policies towards rural indigenous people and their crafts were changing, with the latter being encourage especially to help develop the tourism industry.&lt;ref name="lopez106"/&gt; [[FONART]] became part of the consolidation of distribution efforts for amate paper.  Much of this involved buying all of the Otomi production of bark paper to ensure that the Nahua would have sufficient supplies. Although this intervention lasted for only about two years, it was crucial for developing sales of amate crafts in national and international markets.&lt;ref name="lopez107"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 107&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, while the Nahua are still the principle buyers of Otomi amate paper, the Otomi have since branched out into different types of paper and have developed some of their own products to sell. Today, amate paper is one of the most widely distributed Mexican handcrafts nationally and internationally.&lt;ref name="lopez105"/&gt; It has received artistic and academic attention at both levels as well. In 2006, an annual event called the Encuentro de Arte in Papel Amate was begun in the village, which includes events such as processions, [[Danza de los Voladores de Papantla|Dance of the Voladors]], [[Huapango]] music and more. The main event is the exhibition of works by various artists such as [[Francisco Toledo]], Sergio Hernández, Gabriel Macotela, Gustavo MOnrroy, Cecilio Sánchez, Nicolás de Jesús, David Correa, Héctor Montiel, José Montiel, Laura Montiel, Santiago Regalado Juan Manuel de la Rosa, Ester González, Alejandra Palma Padilla, Nicéforo Hurbieta Moreles, Jorge Lozano and Alfonso García Tellez.&lt;ref name="pahuatlan"&gt;{{cite news |title= Pahuatlán: Una historia en papel amate  |author= Ernesto Romero   |url=http://www.periodicodigital.com.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=14283&amp;Itemid=67  |newspaper= Periodico Digital |location=Puebla |date=April 13, 2007 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pahuatlán:history in amate paper }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City|Museo de Arte Popular]] and the Egyptian embassy in Mexico held an exhibition in 2008 on amate and [[papyrus]] with over sixty objects on display comparing the two ancient traditions.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt; One of the most noted artists in the medium is shaman Alfonso Margarito García Téllez, who has exhibited his work in museums such as the [[San Pedro Museo de Arte]] in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].&lt;ref name="exhiben"&gt;{{cite news |title= Exhiben el uso curativo del papel amate en el pueblo de San Pablito Pahuatlán |author= Paula Carrizosa |url= http://www.lajornadadeoriente.com.mx/2010/12/06/puebla/cul212.php |newspaper= El Sur de Acapulco |location=Acapulco |date=December 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==San Pablito==
While amate is made in a few small villages in northern Puebla, northern Veracruz and southern [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo state]], only [[San Pablito, Puebla|San Pablito in Puebla]] manufactures the paper commercially.&lt;ref name="lopez0207"/&gt; San Pablito is a village in the municipality of [[Pahuatlán]] located in the [[Sierra Norte de Puebla]]. [[Tulancingo]], Hidalgo is the closest urban center. The area is very mountainous and the village itself is on the side of a mountain called the Cerro del Brujo.&lt;ref name="tierra"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt; The making of the paper is the primary economic activity of the community and has alleviated poverty in the village. Before the villagers only had very small houses made of wood, but now they have much larger houses made of block.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt; The paper makers here guard the process greatly and will sever contact with anyone seeking to replicate their work.&lt;ref name="lopez148"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 148&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing income to the paper makers themselves the craft has been employing an increasing number of people to harvest bark, over an area which now extends over 1,500km2 in the Sierra Norte de Puebla region.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt; The village manufactures large quantities of paper, still using mostly pre-Hispanic technology and various tree species for raw material. About half of this paper production is still sold to Nahua painters in Guerrero.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez10"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Paper making has not only brought money into the Otomi population of the community but political clout as well. It is now the most important community economically in the municipality of Pahuatlán, and the last three municipal governments have been headed by an Otomi, which had not happened before.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez9"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the paper making is done by women. One reason for this is that many men still migrate out of the community to work, mostly to the United States. These two sources of income are combined in many households in San Pablito.&lt;ref name="lopez105" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez146"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 146&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic problems of the late 2000s cut sales by about half forcing more to migrate out for work. Before the crisis, the inhabitants of the village were making two thousand sheets per day.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;

==Ritual use==
While the paper has been commercialized in San Pablito, it has not lost its ritual character here or in other areas such as [[Texcatepec]] and [[Chicontepec de Tejada|Chicontepec]], where it is still made for ritual purposes.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; In these communities, the making and ritual use of paper is similar. Figures are cut from light or dark paper, which each figure and each color having significance. There are two types of paper. Light or white paper is used for images of gods or humans. Dark paper is connected with evil characters or sorcery.&lt;ref name="lopez99101"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 99–101&lt;/ref&gt; In Chicontepec, the light paper is made from [[mulberry]] trees, and the dark paper is made from classic amate or fig trees. The older the tree the darker the paper.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;

Ritual paper acquires a sacred value only when [[shaman]]s cut it ritually.&lt;ref name="lopez116"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 116&lt;/ref&gt; The cutting technique is most important, not necessarily artistic although many have aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt; In San Pablito, the cut outs are of gods or supernatural beings related to the indigenous worldview, but never of Catholic figures. Most of the time, the cut out ceremonies relate to petitions such as good crops and health, although as agriculture declines in importance economically, petitions for health and protection have become more important. One particularly popular ceremony is related to young men who have returned from working abroad.&lt;ref name="lopez99101"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez116"/&gt; In Chicontepec, there are cut outs related to gods or spirits linked to natural phenomena such as lightning, rain, mountains, mangos seeds and more, with those cut from dark paper called "devils" or represent evil spirits. However, figures can also represent people living or dead.  Those made of light paper represent good spirits and people who make promises. Female figures are distinguished by locks of hair. Some figures have four arms and two heads in profile, and other have the head and tail of an animal. Those with shoes represent mestizos or bad people who have died in fights, accidents or by drowning, also women who have died in childbirth or children who disrespect their parents. Those without shoes represent indigenous people or good people who have died in sickness or old age. Bad spirits represented in dark paper are burned ceremoniously in order to end their bad influence. Those in light paper are kept as [[amulet]]s.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;

The origin of the use of these cut outs is not known. It may extend back to the pre Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Conquest]] invention, after the Spanish destroyed all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the cut outs do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of cut outs.&lt;ref name="lopez101102"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 101–102&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some cut out figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. Cut outs made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual. These cut outs are also not exactly the same as those made for ritual, with changes made in order to keep the ritual aspect separate.&lt;ref name="lopez116"/&gt;

In San Pablito, the making and cutting of paper is not restricted to shamans, as the rest of the villagers may engage in this. However, only shamans may do paper cutting rituals and the exact techniques of paper making is guarded by the residents of the village from outsiders.&lt;ref name="lopez105"/&gt; The best known shaman related to cut out ritual is Alfonso García Téllez of San Pablito.&lt;ref name="curativo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tributo"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=166 |title= Tributo a las deidades |first= Luis Alberto |last= Martínez Álvarez |date=April 24, 2009 |publisher=State of Puebla |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Tribute to the gods |accessdate=April 15, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110521160510/http://puebla.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=166| archivedate= 21 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He strongly states that the cutting rituals are not witchcraft, but rather a way to honor the spirits of the natural world and a way to help those who have died, along with their families.&lt;ref name="exhiben"/&gt;  García Téllez also creates cut out books about the various Otomi deities, which he has not only sold but also exhibited at museums such as the [[San Pedro Museo de Arte]] in [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].&lt;ref name="exhiben"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tributo"/&gt;

==Amate products==
[[File:AmatePaperCutOutMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Otomi amate paper cut out on display at the Museo de Arte Popular, Mexico City]]
While amate paper is one of a number of paper crafts of Mexico, along with [[papel picado]], [[papier-mâché]]  (such as Judas figures, [[alebrije]]s or decorative items such as strands of [[chili pepper]]s called [[ristra]]s). However, amate paper has been made as a commodity only since the 1960s. Prior to that time, it was made for mostly ritual purposes.&lt;ref name="lopez808"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bercovitch"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/2621-the-mexican-art-forms-of-ristras-papel-amate-and-papel-picado |title= The Mexican art forms of ristras, papel amate and papel picado |author=Helen Bercovitch |date=June 2001 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of amate paper has been as the base for the creation of other products based both in traditional [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexican handcraft]] designs and more modern uses. Because of the product's versatility, both [[Otomi people|Otomi]] artisans and others have developed a number of variations to satisfy the tastes a various handcraft consumers.&lt;ref name="lopez827111"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 80, 2-7, 111&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper is sold plain, dyed in a variety of colors and decorated with items such as dried leaves and flowers.  Although the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] people of [[Guerrero]] remain the principal buyers of Otomi paper,&lt;ref name="lopez135"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; other wholesale buyers  have used it to create products such as lampshades, notebooks,  furniture covers, wallpaper, fancy stationery and  more.&lt;ref name="lopez1710111114"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 2-7,10,111, 114&lt;/ref&gt;  The Otomi themselves have innovated by creating paper products such as envelopes, book separators, invitation cards as well as cut out figures mostly based on traditional ritual designs. The Otomi have also established two categories of paper, standard quality and that produced for the high-end market, geared to well known Nahua artists and other artists that prize the paper's qualities. This is leading to a number of paper makers to be individually recognized like master craftsmen in other fields.&lt;ref name="lopez111142"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 111, 142&lt;/ref&gt;

The Otomi paper makers generally sell their production to a limited number of wholesalers, because of limited Spanish skills and contact with the outside. This means about ten wholesalers controlling the distribution of about half of all Otomi production.&lt;ref name="lopez135"/&gt; These wholesalers, as well as artisans such as the Nahua who use the paper as the basis of their own work, have many more contacts and as a result, retail sales of the product are wide-ranging and varied both within Mexico and abroad.&lt;ref name="lopez10"/&gt; Amate paper products are still sold on the streets and markets in Mexico, much as commercialization of the produce began in the 20th century, often in venues that cater to tourists.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt; However, through wholesalers, the paper also ends up in handicraft stores, open bazaars, specialty shops and the Internet. Much of it is used to create paintings, and the finest of these have been exhibited in both national and international museums and galleries.&lt;ref name="lopez0207" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez10"/&gt; The paper is sold retail in the town to tourists as well as in shops in cities such as [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]], [[Tijuana]], Mexico City, [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]], [[Monterrey]] and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]]. It is also exported to the United States, especially to [[Miami]].&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;

However, about fifty percent of all Otomi paper production is still done in standard 40&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm size and sold to Nahua painters from Guerrero, the market segment which made the mass commercialization of the product possible.&lt;ref name="lopez111135142"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 111, 135, 142 105&lt;/ref&gt; Seventy percent of all the craft production of these Otomi and Nahuas is sold on the national market with about thirty percent reaching the international market.&lt;ref name="lopez142"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 142&lt;/ref&gt; As most amate paper is sold as the backing for these paintings, so many consumers assume the Nahua produce the paper as well.&lt;ref name="lopez112"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 112&lt;/ref&gt;

The amate paper paintings are a combination of Nahua and Otomi traditions. The Otomi produce the paper, and the Nahua have transferred and adapted painting traditions associated with ceramics  to the paper. The [[Nahuatl]] word "amate" is applied to both the paper and the paintings done on the paper. Each Nahua village has its own painting style  which was developed for ceramics, originally commercialized in [[Acapulco]] and other tourist areas as early as the 1940s. The adaption of this painting to amate paper came in the 1960s and quickly spread to various villages until it became the primary economic activity in eight Nahua villages in Guerrero, Ameyaltepec, Oapan, Ahuahuapan, Ahuelican, Analco, San Juan Tetelcingo, Xalitla and Maxela.&lt;ref name="lopez105106"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; The paper is that it evokes Mexico's pre-Columbian past in addition to the customary designs painted on it.&lt;ref name="lopez109"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 109&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of these paintings led to the Nahuas buying just about all of the Otomis' paper production in that decade. It also attracted the attention of the government, which was taking an interest in indigenous crafts and promoting them to tourists. The FONART agency became involved for two years, buying Otomi paper to make sure that the Nahua had sufficient supplies for painting. This was crucial for the development of national and international markets for the paintings and the paper.&lt;ref name="lopez105106"/&gt; It also worked to validate the "new" craft as legitimate, using symbols of past and present minority peoples as part of Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="lopez109"/&gt;

The paintings started with and still mostly based on traditional designs from pottery although there has been innovation since then. Painted designs began focusing on birds and flowers on the paper. Experimentation led to landscape painting, especially scenes related to rural life such as farming, fishing, weddings, funerals and religious festivals. It even has included the painting of picture frames.&lt;ref name="lopez110"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 110&lt;/ref&gt; Some painters have become famous in their own right for their work. Painter [[Nicolás de Jesús]], from Ameyaltepec has gained international recognition for his paintings, exhibiting abroad in countries such as France, Germany, England and Italy. His works generally touch on themes such as death, oppression of indigenous peoples and various references to popular culture in his local community.&lt;ref name="rosado"&gt;{{cite news |title= El arte en amate, tradición olmeca que continúan indígenas de Guerrero y Puebla |author= Xavier Rosado |url= http://www.suracapulco.com.mx/anterior/2002/diciembre/03/pag2.htm |newspaper= El Sur de Acapulco |location=Acapulco |date=December 3, 2002 |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Art in amate, Olmec tradition that the indigenous of Guerrero and Puebla continue }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have innovated ways to speed up the work, such as using [[silk-screen]] techniques to make multiple copies.&lt;ref name="lopez125"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 125&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Nahua paintings remain the most important craft form related to amate paper, the Otomi have adopted their elaborate cut out figures to the commercial market as well. This began with shamans creating booklets with miniature cut outs of gods with handwritten explanations. Eventually, these began to sell and this success led to their commercialization in markets in Mexico City, were the Otomi connected with the Nahua in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="lopez105"/&gt; The Otomi still sell cut outs in traditional designs, but have also experimented with newer designs, paper sizes, colors and types of paper.&lt;ref name="lopez112" /&gt; These cut outs include depictions of various gods, especially those related to beans, coffee, corn, pineapples, tomatoes and rain. However, these cut outs are not 100% authentic, with exact replicas still reserved to shamans for ritual purposes. Innovation has included the development of books, and cut outs of suns, flowers, birds, abstract designs from traditional beadwork and even [[Valentine's Day|Valentine]] hearts with painted flowers. Most cut outs are made of one type of paper, then glued onto a contrasting background. Their sizes range from miniatures in booklets to sizes large enough to frame and hang like a painting.&lt;ref name="lopez113"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 113&lt;/ref&gt;  The production and sale of these paper products have brought tourism to San Pablito, mostly from Hidalgo, Puebla and Mexico City, but some come from the far north and south of Mexico and even from abroad.&lt;ref name="lopez138"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 138&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A paper partially flattened..JPG|thumb|A partially flattened mass of fibers being smoothed with orange peel for demonstration.San Pablito, Puebla, Mexico]]
While there have been some minor innovations, amate paper is still made using the same basic process that was used in the pre Hispanic period.&lt;ref name="lopez123124"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; The process begins with obtaining the bark for its fiber. Traditionally, these are from trees of the fig ([[Ficus]]) family as this bark is the easiest to process. Some large Ficus trees are considered sacred and can be found surrounded with candles and offering of cut amate paper.&lt;ref name="lopez9"/&gt;&lt;ref name="floema"&gt;{{Cite report |title=El uso del floema secundario en la elaboración de papel amate |url=http://www.izt.uam.mx/contactos/n69ne/papel.pdf |author=Alejandro Quintanar-Isáis |author2=Citlalli López Binnqüist |author3=Marie Vander Meeren |year=2008 |publisher=1Depto. de Biolog´ıa, UAM-I, Centro de Investigaciones Tropicales, Universidad Veracruzana, Instituto Nacional de Antropolog´ıa e Historia |accessdate=April 15, 2011 |docket= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522171508/http://www.izt.uam.mx/contactos/n69ne/papel.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-22 |deadurl=yes |date= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary species used include ''[[Ficus cotinifolia|F. cotinifolia]],'' ''[[Ficus padifolia|F. padifolia]]'' and ''[[Ficus petiolaris|F. petiolaris]]'', the classic amate tree, along with several non-ficus species such as [[Morus celtidifolia]], Citrus [[anurantifolia]] and [[Heliocarpos Donnell-Smithii Rose]].&lt;ref name="Miller" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tierra"/&gt; However, the taxonomical identification of trees used for amate paper production is not exact, leading estimates of wild supplies inaccurate.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lopez17"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 17&lt;/ref&gt; The softer inner bark is preferred but other parts are used as well.&lt;ref name="floema"/&gt; Outer bark and bark from ficus trees tend to make darker paper and inner bark and mulberry bark tends to make lighter paper. Bark is best cut in the spring when it is new, which does less damage. It also is less damaging to take bark from older ficus trees as this bark tends to peel off more easily.&lt;ref name="chicontepec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rosado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="floema"/&gt; The commercialization of the product has meant that a wider range of area needs to be searched for appropriate trees. This has specialized the harvesting of bark to mostly people from outside San Pablito, with only a few paper makers harvesting their own bark.&lt;ref name="lopez123"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 123&lt;/ref&gt; These bark collectors generally come to the village at the end of the week, but numbers of harvesters and amount of bark can vary greatly, depending on the time of year and other factors.&lt;ref name="lopez8"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; The paper makers generally buy the bark fresh then dry it for storage. After drying, the bark can be conserved for about a year.&lt;ref name="lopez125"/&gt;

From the beginning of commercialization, the making of a paper brought in most of the village's population into the process in one way or another. However, in the 1980s, many men in the area began to leave as migrant workers, mostly to the United States, sending remittances home. This then became the main source of income to San Pablito, and made paper making not only secondary, but mostly done by women.&lt;ref name="lopez123125"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 123,125&lt;/ref&gt; The basic equipment used are stones to beat the fibers, wooden boards and pans to boil the bark. All of these come from sources outside San Pablito. The stones come from [[Tlaxcala]]. The boards come from two nearby villages of Zoyotla and Honey and the boiling pans are obtained by local hardware stores from [[Tulancingo]].&lt;ref name="lopez130"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 130&lt;/ref&gt;

In the pre Hispanic period, the bark was first soaked for a day or more to soften it before it was worked. An innovation documented from at least the 20th century is to boil the bark instead, which is faster. To shorten the boiling time, ashes or [[lime (material)|lime]] were introduced into the water, later replaced by industrial [[caustic soda]]. With the last ingredient, the actual boiling time is between three and six hours, although with set up the process takes anywhere from half to a full day. It can only be done during certain weather conditions (dry days) and it requires constant attention. The amount boiled at one time ranges from 60 to 90&amp;nbsp;kg with 3.5&amp;nbsp;kg of caustic soda. The bark needs to be stirred constantly. After boiling, the bark is then rinsed in clean water.&lt;ref name="lopez124125"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 124-125&lt;/ref&gt;

The softened fibers are kept in water until they are processed. This needs to be done as quickly as possible so that they do not rot.&lt;ref name="lopez124127"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 124, 127&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, [[chlorine]] bleach may be added to either lighten the paper entirely or to create a mix of shades to create a marbled effect. This step has become necessary due to the lack of naturally light bark fibers.&lt;ref name="lopez126"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 126&lt;/ref&gt; If the paper is to be colored, strong industrial dyes are used. These can vary from purple, red, green or pink, whatever the demand is.&lt;ref name="lopez127"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Wooden boards are sized to the paper being made. They are rubbed with soap so that the fibers do not stick. The fibers are arranged on wooden boards and beaten together into a thin flat mass. The best paper is made with long fibers arranged in a grid pattern to fit the board. Lesser quality paper is made from short masses arranged more haphazardly, but still beaten to the same effect.&lt;ref name="lopez8124127"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 8, 124, 127&lt;/ref&gt; This maceration process liberates soluble carbohydrates that are in the cavities of the cell fibers and act as a kind of glue. The Ficus tree bark contains a high quantity of this substance allowing to make for firm  but flexible paper.&lt;ref name="floema"/&gt; During the process, the stones are kept moist to keep the paper from sticking to it. The finished flat mass is then usually smoothed over with rounded orange peels. If there are any gaps after the maceration process, these are usually filled in by gluing small pieces of paper.&lt;ref name="lopez12129"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 12, 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Remaining on their boards, the pounded sheets are taken outside to dry. Drying times vary due to weather conditions. On dry and sunny days, this can take an hour or two, but in humid conditions it can take days.&lt;ref name="lopez124128"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 124, 128&lt;/ref&gt; If the dried sheets are to be sold wholesale, they are then simply bundled. If to be sold retail, the edges are then trimmed with a blade.&lt;ref name="lopez129"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 129&lt;/ref&gt;

The production process in San Pablito  has mostly evolved to make paper as quickly as possible, with labor being divided and specialized and new tools and ingredients added towards this end.&lt;ref name="lopez117"&gt;López Binnqüist, page 117&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all production facilities are family based, but the level of organization varies. Most paper making is done inside the home by those who are dedicated to it either full or part-time.  If the paper is made only part-time, then the work is done sporadically and usually only by women and children. A more recent phenomenon is the development of large workshops which hire artisans to do the work, supervised by the family which owns the enterprise. These are often established by families who have invested money sent home by migrant worker into materials and equipment.&lt;ref name="lopez131132"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 131-132&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the production of all these facilities is plain sheet of 40&amp;nbsp;cm by 60&amp;nbsp;cm, but the larger workshops make the greatest variety of products including giant sheets of 1.2 by 2.4 meters in size.&lt;ref name="lopez129132"&gt;López Binnqüist, pages 129,132&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological concerns ==
The commercialization of amate paper has had negative environmental effects. In pre-Hispanic times, bark was taken only from the branches of adult trees, allowing for regeneration.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt; [[Ficus]] trees should be optimally no younger than 25 years old before cutting. At that age the bark almost peels off by itself and does less damage to the tree. Other trees such as mulberry do not have to mature as much.&lt;ref name="rosado"/&gt;  The pressure to provide large quantities of bark means that it is taken from younger trees as well.&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt; This is negatively affecting the ecosystem of northern Puebla and forcing harvesters to take bark from other species as well as from a wider range, moving into areas such as [[Tlaxco Municipality, Puebla|Tlaxco]].&lt;ref name="papiro"/&gt;&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nuevatec"&gt;{{cite press release |title= Nueva tecnología, garantiza producción sustentable de Papel Amate en la Sierra Norte de Puebla |publisher=[[FONART]] |date=April 6, 2011 |url= http://www.fonart.gob.mx/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=126&amp;Itemid=142 |language=Spanish |trans-title=New technology guarantees sustainable production of Amate paper in the Sierra Norte de Puebla |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another problem is the introduction of caustic soda and other industrial chemicals into the process, which not only gets into the environment and water supply, can also directly poison artisans who do not handle it properly.&lt;ref name="nuevatec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonart"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.fonart.gob.mx/web/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=113:produccion-sustentable-de-papel-amate&amp;catid=37:noticias-de-portada&amp;Itemid=113 |title= Investigación interinstitucional garantiza producción sustentable de papel amate |year=2010 |publisher=[[FONART]] |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=Inter-institutional research guarantees sustainable production of amate paper |accessdate=April 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesanías]] (FONART), the [[Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana]]-Iztapalapa, the [[Universidad Veracruzana]] and the [[Instituto de Artesanías e Industrias Populares]] de Puebla have been working on ways to make amate paper making more sustainable. One aspect is to manage the collection of bark. Another is to find a substitute for caustic soda to soften and prepare the fibers without losing quality. Not only is the soda polluting, it has had negative effects on artisans' health. As of 2010, the group has reported advances in its investigations such as ways of including new types of bark from other species.&lt;ref name="nuevatec"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fonart"/&gt;&lt;ref name="avanza"&gt;{{cite news |title= Avanza producción sustentable de papel amate en San Pablito |author= Ángel A.

In addition, the [[Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropología Social]] (CIESAS) is urging a reforestation plan in order to implement a more sustainable supply of bark.&lt;ref name="extinguirse"/&gt;

'''An Ecosystem of Excess''' is an art project by artist and researcher [[Pinar Yoldas]]. The project addresses a series of ecological problems such as man-made [[extreme environments]], [[consumer capitalism]], [[plastic pollution]] and [[threatened species]] in the age of the [[Anthropocene]]. Yoldas was awarded the Ernst Schering Foundation Arts &amp; Culture Grant for her project, and An Ecosystem of Excess was premiered in Ernst Schering Project Space in Berlin in 2014.&lt;ref name="Ernst Schering"&gt;[http://www.scheringstiftung.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2761%3Apinar-yoldas-an-ecosystem-of-excess&amp;catid=65%3Arueckschau&amp;Itemid=151&amp;lang=en "Pinar Yoldas: An Ecosystem of Excess"], ''Ernst Schering Foundation'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is an artistic imagination of a post-anthropocene [[ecosystem]] where non-human living creatures are evolved to digest plastic while human species goes extinct. It portrays the future story of alien life forms that emerge from the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]], in the form of a [[dystopian]] re-staging of [[Abiogenesis]]. For the project, Yoldas worked with [[marine biologist]] [[Sylvia Earle]] .&lt;ref name="Style Park"&gt;[https://www.stylepark.com/en/news/welcome-to-the-plastivorizene "Welcome to the Plastivorizene"], ''Stylepark'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
An Ecosystem of Excess is a work informed by scientific research which confirms the emergence of new bacteria which adapt to plastic environments or what is scientifically called the [[plastisphere]], yet, it is a product of speculative fiction that takes inspiration but departs from science.&lt;ref name="Aksioma"&gt;[http://aksioma.org/ecosystem.of.excess "Pinar Yoldas: An Ecosystem of Excess"], ''Aksioma'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Environmental Science and Technology Journal"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zettler|first1=Erik R.|last2=Mincer|first2=Tracy J.|last3=Amaral-Zettler|first3=Linda A.|title=Life in the "Plastisphere": Microbial Communities on Plastic Marine Debris|journal=Environmental Science and Technology|date=June 7, 2013|volume=47|issue=13|pages=7137–7146|doi=10.1021/es401288x|url=http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es401288x/|accessdate=27 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Miriam C.|last2=Rosenberg|first2=Marci|last3=Cheng|first3=Lanna|title=Increased oceanic microplastic debris enhances oviposition in an endemic pelagic insect|journal=Biology Letters|date=May 9, 2012|volume=8|issue=5|pages=817–820.|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.0298|pmc=3440973|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It points to evolution and how this process is indirectly altered by human intervention in the age of [[Anthropocene]].&lt;ref name="Digicult"&gt;[http://www.digicult.it/news/shaping-alternative-futures-interview-pinar-yoldas/ "Shaping Alternative Futures: Interview with Pinar Yoldas], ''Digicult'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The work involves a creative exaggeration of scientific facts, and more generally, a research about "the collaborative potential between art and biological sciences."&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;[http://cdh.ucla.edu/event/dma-lecture-pinar-yoldas/ "Digital Humanities Lecture: Pinar Yoldas"], ''UCLA Center for Digital Humanities'', Retrieved 27 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist-theorists [[Zach Blas]] and Christopher O'Leary describe the work as a design of "synthetic biological systems as a living critique of our society." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Blas|first1=Zach|last2=O'Leary|first2=Christopher|title=Speculative (exhibition catalogue)|date=2011|page=114|pages=|url=https://books.google.com/?id=igQ9AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9781257799800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arezzo posizione.svg|thumb|237x237px|The Arezzo 1465 vase was found in Arezzo, in the Etruria region of Italy.]]
The '''Arezzo 1465 vase''' is an [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic]] [[Krater|volute krater]] attributed to [[Euphronios]], that dates to the [[Archaic Greece|Late Archaic period]] (550-510 BCE). It is a [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure style]] vase, which became popular during the time of its making, and it was found in [[Arezzo|Arezzo, Italy]] in the Etruria region in 1465 due to the vast trade network stemming from Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arezzobedandwine.com/en/routes/arezzo-history.html|title=Arezzo History|website=www.arezzobedandwine.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vase is currently housed in Arezzo, in the ''Museo Archeologico Nazionale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archeotoscana.wordpress.com/about/arezzo-museo-archeologico-nazionale/|title=Arezzo, Museo Archeologico Nazionale e anfiteatro romano|date=2013-05-31|work=ARCHEOTOSCANA|access-date=2017-12-03|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Attica, cratere di euphronios, 500-470 ac. ca. 02.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Attica,%20cratere%20di%20euphronios,%20500-470%20ac.%20ca.%2002.JPG|thumb|left|The depictions on one side of the Arezzo 1465 vase include Herakles and Telamon fighting the Amazons.|277x277px]]

The entire body of the vase primarily focuses on an [[amazonomachy]], which is a battle between the [[Greeks]] and the [[Amazons]], a nation of all-female warriors from mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/amazon/|title=Amazon|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One side leads into the other, showing three Greek [[hoplite]]s and an [[Amazons|Amazon]] seemingly running into battle, shown by their equipment of shields, spears, and helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1993.01.0363|title=Perseus:image:1993.01.0363|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other side shows [[Heracles|Herakles]] and [[Telamon]] battling the [[Amazons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1993.01.0355|title=Perseus:image:1993.01.0355|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frieze on the neck shows a [[komos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1993.01.0358|title=Perseus:image:1993.01.0358|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a drunken ritual that was performed during Ancient Greek celebrations.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.definitions.net/definition/komos|title=What does komos mean?|website=www.definitions.net|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euphronios]] chose to include multiple inscriptions on this krater: CHORITHON, KAIKEOS, (kalos/kale) PHILLIADESKALOS, (kalos/kale) XENON KALOS, LYSIS, PHILLIADES, TEISIS, XENON, and XINIS &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.beazley.ox.ac.uk/XDB/ASP/recordDetails.asp?id=FB884EA4-9B56-49C9-A98D-5605FA829560&amp;noResults=&amp;recordCount=&amp;databaseID=&amp;search=|title=Provenance - The Classical Art Research Centre|website=www.beazley.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Euphronios]] was a part of the [[Pioneer Group]], and was known to be a major component in the transition from [[Black-figure pottery|black-figure]] to [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] pottery in Ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Euphronios|title=Euphronios {{!}} Greek artist|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; His use of [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure]] on this [[krater]] allowed him to add an increasing amount of detail to the figures and scenes he depicted, like the textures of Herakles' club and lion skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/Red-Figure_Pottery/|title=Red-Figure Pottery|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1993.01.0357|title=Perseus:image:1993.01.0357|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depictions ==
All depictions on this vase point towards warfare in [[Ancient Greece]]. The body shows an [[amazonomachy]] with clear indications of Greek [[Hoplite]]s, which all carry spears and wear the style of helmet and shield that were historically attributed to [[Hoplite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hellenic-art.com/greek-hoplite-armor.html|title=Greek Hoplite Armor &amp; Weapons|website=www.hellenic-art.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as hints towards the other warriors being the [[Amazons]], due to their use of a bow rather than spear, the long thin bodies indicative of a more feminine body type, and their different style of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Amazon-Greek-mythology|title=Amazon {{!}} Greek mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heracles|Herakles]] is known to be a great warrior and hero, so the placement of him among everything else is also indicative of some sort of battle, or of something that he is contributing his efforts in order to reign victorious. [[Telamon]], a friend of the demigod [[Heracles|Herakles]], is commonly thought of in reference to the myth where [[Telamon]] assists [[Heracles|Herakles]] in killing the sea monster that [[Poseidon]] sends to destroy the city of [[Troy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Telamon/telamon.html|title=Telamon|website=www.greekmythology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than an [[amazonomachy]] like this [[krater]] depicts, however his presence then further solidifies the warfare theme as he is directly tied to another mythical battle.

Even the [[komos]] scene along the neck of the vase is a celebration. Though the direct purpose of a [[komos]] is still unclear, they were performed at post-game celebrations for victorious athletes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In [[Ancient Greece]], people regarded warriors as the greatest athletes, with [[Heracles|Herakles]] as the epitome of  heroic athletes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunt|first=David|date=Fall 2009|title=The Heroic Athlete in Ancient Greece|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2009/JSH3603/jsh3603i.pdf|journal=Journal of Sport History|volume=36|pages=375–392|via=Sports Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; so even this contributes to the warfare theme. The [[komos]] scene could be celebrating the victory of [[Heracles|Herakles]] over the [[Amazons]] in his [[Labours of Hercules|9th labor]] to retrieve the [[Girdle Of Hippolyta|Belt of Hippolyta]], the queen of the [[Amazons]], as this is the only mythological reference to any interaction between [[Heracles|Herakles]] and the [[Amazons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hippolyta/hippolyta.html|title=Hippolyta|website=www.greekmythology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as none of the [[Amazons]] on this [[krater]] are identifiable as [[Hippolyta]] and the belt is not on the vase either, it can only be said with certainty that this vase depicts an [[amazonomachy]] which involves [[Heracles|Herakles]].

An '''artistic director''' may refer to someone who directs a [[musical ensemble]], and in this medium, is often abbreviated as simply Director. The typical jobs of a musical artistic director are to choose repertoire for the ensemble, come up with an artistic vision for the group and also a long-term strategy for programming, and also to help choose performers if the ensemble is not pre-set. An artistic director may also be—and often is—the conductor of the ensemble and a "jack of all trades", performing multiple roles and even managing the ensemble, although that role is often left to a [[Managing Director]] if financial resources are available. A musical artistic director essentially mirrors a theatrical [[artistic director]], albeit working in a different medium.

'''August Suter''' (19 July 1887 – 28 November 1965) was one of the most prominent Swiss sculptors of European stature in the first half of the 20th century. His circle of friends included important literary figures like [[Blaise Cendrars]] and [[James Joyce]].

==Life==

August Suter was born at [[Basel]], the son of Johannes Suter (1857–1907) a bookbinder from [[Eptingen]] and Katharina Suter-Schaub (1859–1941).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eptingen.ch/02_gemeinde/museum/museum_suter.htm|title=Gemeinde Eptingen - August Suter Museum|website=www.eptingen.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an apprenticeship as a bookbinder with his father and courses in painting and drawing at the Basel Gewerbeschule (vocational school) he worked for local sculptor Carl Gutknecht (1878–1970), before he went to the [[Académie Julian]] in Paris in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;(fr) [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F49744.php Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse, Suter]&lt;/ref&gt; But he soon became an independent artist there and formed lifelong friendships with the writer [[Blaise Cendrars]]&lt;ref&gt;Suter had known Fred Sauser (Cendrar's real name) from the late 1890s at the Realschule in Basel.&lt;/ref&gt; and the English painter [[Frank Budgen]], who worked as a model for him.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Budgen, ''Myselves When Young'', London: 1970&lt;/ref&gt; Cendrars was later to write a successful novel (''L'Or'') about Suter’s grandfather, [[John Sutter|Johann August]] of gold rush fame. [[Rodo]] (Auguste de Niederhäusern) advised him to whole-heartedly turn to sculpture. A long-standing friend was the Swiss poet and translator [[:de:Siegfried Lang|Siegfried Lang]]. Shortly before the War he also became acquainted with the German writer and anarchist [[:de:Johannes Nohl|Johannes Nohl]]. During the [[World War I]] Suter worked in Basel and [[Zurich]], where he, his brother Paul and Frank Budgen got to know the exiled Irish writer [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;August Suter, “Some Reminiscences of James Joyce”, ''James Joyce Quarterly'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;7, No.&amp;nbsp;3, Spring, 1970, pp.&amp;nbsp;191-98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suter was one of the few people who attended Joyce’s funeral in war-locked Zurich in 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; He married singer Helene Moser (1893–1965) in 1917 and had three sons. From 1921 to 1939 Suter lived in Paris again and befriended the sculptor [[Charles Despiau]], whose studio lay next to his.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Gotthard Jedlicka, "Der Bildhauer August Suter" in ''Das Werk'', Band 14, 1927, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]] he worked intermittently in Paris and Basel, where he died at the age of 79 just months after his wife.

==Work==

Suter's naturalistic work is dominated by male and female nudes, figure compositions, portrait busts and architectural sculpture. In 1925 [[:de:Ludwig Marcuse Ludwig Marcuse|Ludwig Marcuse]] called him “the most important sculptor of our time”.&lt;ref&gt;''Literatur-Geschichte der Gegenwart'', vol 1, Berlin 1925, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; At first he was influenced by [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]] and [[Antoine Bourdelle|Bourdelle]], but turned to [[Aristide Maillol|Maillol's]] classicism in the fourth decade of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Gantner-Schlee, Hildegard, Leaflet of the August-Suter-Museum at Eptingen&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[:de:Gotthard Jedlicka|Gotthard Jedlicka]] points out an important difference to Rodin: "where Rodin seizes impetuously, he waits calmly, and everytime he imbeds the unique rhythm of a particular life into the specific rhythm of his composition".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Suters most famous sculpture is the memorial “Prometheus and the Soul” for the Swiss Nobel Prize poet [[Carl Spitteler]] at Liestal near Basel, which he worked on from 1926 to 1931.

An unburned clay sculpture of [[James Joyce]] did not survive World War II.&lt;ref&gt;August Suter, “Some Reminiscences of James Joyce”, ''James Joyce Quarterly'', Vol. 7, No. 3, Spring, 1970, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suter’s son Claude donated his father's artistic legacy to the Basel municipality of Eptingen where it is accessible on request (museum@eptingen.ch).

'''Auguste Nicolas Trémont''' (31 December 1892 – 23 October 1980) was a [[Luxembourger]] [[painter]], [[sculptor]], and [[medallist]]. He specialised in [[sculpture]]s of animals, with a particular emphasis on [[big cat]]s.

==Life==
After spending his childhood in Luxembourg, Auguste Tremont moved to [[Paris]] where he enrolled at the [[École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs|Ecole des Arts décoratifs]] in 1909. [[World War I]] caught him by surprise while he was visiting Luxembourg. As he tried to make his way back to Paris by passing through [[Switzerland]], he was arrested by German forces near the Swiss border and was imprisoned. Once released from detention, he returned to Luxembourg where he remained until the end of the war in 1918, working in a steel factory in [[Dudelange]] This work gave him the opportunity to practice his skills by drawing pictures of steel workers in action; he also befriended future [[Arbed]] president [[Aloyse Meyer]].

At the end of the war, Trémont returned to Paris where he studied at the [[Ecole des Beaux Arts]]. He first specialized in portraits and pictures of Paris and still life. This changed when he visited the [[Jardin des Plantes]], the [[zoological gardens]], where he found the subjects that were to become his main area of specialization: animals. Later in his life, when asked why he chose to represent animals, he replied: “because it was the most difficult task”.

In 1924, Trémont made his first [[sculptures]], and he subsequently developed his skills as a sculptor by creating animal sculptures in a variety of sizes and species. The late 1920s-early 1930s were his most productive years; it is during this period that he sculpted, in Paris, two large lions that now decorate the entrance of the [[Luxembourg City Hall]]. He spent [[World War II]] in Paris, and returned to Luxembourg at the end of the war where he created [[monuments]] for the victims of the war. He later returned to his wonderful detailed still life and oil paintings of flowers and portraits. 

Tremont's work was made available to the public through the Ruhlmann art gallery, then later Edgar Brandt and Malesherbes art galleries. His work is also represented on numerous Luxembourgian stamps.

== Major works ==

Works by Trémont adorn some of the most prominent buildings in his hometown of [[Luxembourg City]] {{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, including [[Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg|Notre-Dame Cathedral]] and [[Luxembourg City Hall]].  He also created sculptures for the Luxembourgish pavilions at the [[Exposition universelle et internationale (1935)|Brussels 1935]] and [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne (1937)|Paris 1937]] [[World's Fair]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11420">The Commonwealth of [[Australia]]'s ''Designs Act 2003'' replaced the ''Designs Act 1906''. The legislation assists in the protection of the overall appearance of a product resulting from one or more visual features of the product. Although there are some overlaps, the Designs Act is not applicable when defending the functional [[innovation]]s of a product. In [[common law]], ''Firmagroup Australia Pty Ltd v Byrne &amp; Davidson Doors'' (1987) 180 CLR 483, supports this. Firmagroup Australia Pty registered a design for a ‘combination handle and lock for shutter doors’. The innovative product was copied by Byrne &amp; Davidson, and Firmagroup sued for infringement on design. The High Court held that the ‘combination handle and lock for shutter doors’ was ‘an idea of shape or configuration’, which is ‘conveyed by those features’, was ‘too general to attract statutory protection’. The Court then restricted the [[monopoly]] to the specific, individual appearance. Further, it added that ‘No design should be so construed as to give to its proprietor a monopoly in a method or principle of construction.’&lt;ref&gt;''Firmagroup Australia Pty Ltd v Byrne &amp; Davidson Doors'' (1987) 180 CLR 483.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendant proved to distinguish his product adequately, and thus did not infringe on Firmagroup’s design.

==Definition of a design==
Under the legislation, a design, in relation to a product, means the overall appearance of the product resulting from one or more visual features of the product.&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s5"&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s5.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the design is only a design, for the purposes of the Designs Act, when it is used in relation to the registered product.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s8.&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates that the registration of the design does not protect the business against the same design being used on other products; the pattern itself cannot be registered.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, M., J., Monotti, A., L., Wiseman, L., (2008) Australian Intellectual Property Law, New York, USA, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the act covers both, two-dimensional designs&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s63"&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6(3).&lt;/ref&gt; (such as a logo on a cup), and three-dimensional designs&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s63"/&gt; (such as the shape of the cup). Furthermore, Dixon J, in ''Macrae Knitting Mills Ltd v Lowes Ltd'' (1936) 55 CLR 725, confirms that ‘The Act is concerned with shape and configuration, not function’. The Act, stipulates that a visual feature may, but need not, serve a functional purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s7 (2).&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the design’s every visual feature serves a functional purpose, then common law states that the design is not registrable.&lt;ref&gt;W. van caenegem (2006), Intellectual Property (2nd ed), Sydney, [[LexisNexis]] Butterworths; Dart Industries Inc v Décor Corp Pty Ltd (1989) 15 IPR 403 408: ‘if the shape exists solely to make the article work or function then it is not within the concept of a registered design’. Cited with approval in Phillips Electronics NV v Remington Products Australia Pty Ltd (1997) 39 IPR 283, 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the Designs Act states that should an innovation be both, a visual feature, and serve a functional purpose, there is nothing to stop the design being registered.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

In common law, ''British Franco Electric Pty Ltd v Dowling Plastics Pty Ltd'' [1981] NSWLR 448, reinforces the view the courts take on the distinction between a function and a design. In the case, both companies entered into a business selling and manufacturing furniture castors. Dowling Plastics developed the castor, and British Franco registered the design. Soon after the joint venture broke up, Dowling Plastics continued the production of the castors. However, British Franco claimed that Dowling Plastics were infringing on British Franco’s [[Industrial design rights|registered design]]. Dowling put forth an argument questioning the validity of the registration of the design, as the only novel feature of the castor served a functional purpose, and when the castor is assembled, the design would not be seen. The court held in favour of Dowling, however, they were not persuaded by the business’s argument, ruling that the functional purpose of the article is irrelevant, when the design does not satisfy other requirements for registration.

==Definition of a ‘product’==
The act outlines, that a product is a thing that is manufactured or handmade.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6 (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Further, even if a component part of a product is made separately from the product itself, for the purposes of the Designs Act, it is still a product.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6(2)&lt;/ref&gt; Even a kit made for assembly of a particular product, is that product.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the issue came to designs that vary in their dimensions (such as roof guttering), the items are still considered products, as long as following conditions apply:
* a) A cross-section taken across any indefinite dimension is fixed or varies according to a regular pattern;
* b) All the dimensions remain in proportion
* c) The cross-sectional shape remains the same throughout, whether or not the dimensions of that shape vary according to a ratio or series of ratios;
* d) It has a pattern or ornamentation that repeats itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s6 (3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distinction between the design and the product==
One of the deep-seated aspects of the Designs Act is the distinction between the idea of a product, and the design relating to that product. Thus, the designs act will not grant a monopoly to a business attempting to register a fundamental or essential form of a product.
This is supported by common law, in ''Dalgety Australia Operations Ltd v Seeley Nominees Pty Ltd'' (1985) 5 IPR 97, when the High Court held that the Designs Act does not give a monopoly to the trading of the article to which it is applied. For example, without a design, a chair would still be a chair, a fork would still be a fork, etc.… Bollen, J, further clarified that &lt;blockquote&gt;
a design
turns a chair into something more than a mere chair. It becomes a chair with a conception or suggestion about shape or configuration beyond the fundamental form of a chair
&lt;/blockquote&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Dalgety Australia Operations Ltd v Seeley Nominees Pty Ltd'' (1985) 5 IPR 97&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the case established that a fundamental form cannot be registered as a design.

==Component and spare parts==
The Designs Act also caters for components and spare parts of a product. The Act provides a monopoly for a component part of a product, which it deems to be a product for the purposes of the act.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth)s7(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
However, The Designs Act does not provide clarity when the issue is regarding a fundamental nature of components and spare parts. It is deep-seated in legislation and common law, that if a product is a fundamental form or shape of a product, then the product cannot be registrable. Although the spare part is purely manufactured for the purpose of attaching to its larger counterpart, it is not clear if that is seen, by legislation and common law, as being dictated by a functional purpose. Further, in most cases, the designer of the spare part also had a number of potential shapes to choose from, thus the spare part cannot be the fundamental form, thus rendering the product registrable.

==When is a design registrable?==
The design is registrable if it fits the following characteristics:
* a) The design is new
* b) The design is distinctive when compared to the [[prior art]] base for the design as it existed before the priority date of the design &lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design rights==
After registration, the owner of the registered design owns a renewable monopoly for 5 years, and has the [[exclusive right]]s to :
* a) To make or offer to make a product, in relation to which the design is registered, which embodies the design; and
* b) To import such a product into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business; and
* c) To sell, hire and otherwise dispose of, or offer to sell, hire or otherwise deispose of, such a product; and
* d) To use such a product in any way for the purpose of any trade or business; and
* e) To keep such a product for the purpose of doing any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d)
* f) To authorize another person to do any of the things mentioned in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e)&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth)s10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infringement of designs==
A person infringes a registered design if, during the term of registration of the design, and without the licence or authority of the registered owner of the design, the person:
* (a) makes or offers to make a product, in relation to which the design is registered, which embodies a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression to, the registered design; or
* (b) imports such a product into Australia for sale, or for use for the purposes of any trade or business; or
* (c) sells, hires or otherwise disposes of, or offers to sell, hire or otherwise dispose of, such a product; or
* (d) uses such a product in any way for the purposes of any trade or business; or
* (e) keeps such a product for the purpose of doing any of the things mentioned in paragraph (c) or (d)&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth)s71(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identical or substantially similar in overall impression==
In subsection (a), the section mentions a design that is identical to, or substantially similar in overall impression. While the test for the design being identical is uncomplicated, to determine whether the design is substantially similar in overall impression and how it is substantially similar, the act refers to s19. The section stipulates that the court pay more attention to the similarities rather than the differences, must have regard for prior art base, and contextualize a certain part of the design that is similar, in relation to the whole design. The court must then apply the standard of a person who is familiar with the product to which the design relates, or products similar to the product to which the design relates.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s19.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Act does not require any party to establish that the registered design was copied, the mere registration of the design, protects against independent creation.

==Defences==
If the defendant is repairing a complex product that has at least two replaceable component parts, permitting disassembly and re-assembly,&lt;ref name="Designs Act 2003 Cth s5"/&gt; then they may claim a defence under s72 of the Act, on the condition that the repair is for the purpose of restoring the complex products’ overall appearance.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s72.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Legal burden of proof|onus of proof]] is on the plaintiff to prove that the defendant knew, or ought reasonably to have known that the use of authorisation was not for the permitted purpose.&lt;ref&gt;''Designs Act 2003'' (Cth) s72(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The name ''Bhimbetka'' (भीमबेटका) is associated with [[Bhima]], a hero-deity of the epic ''[[Mahabharata]]''.&lt;ref name=mathpal&gt;[[Yashodhar Mathpal|Mathpal, Yashodhar]]. ''Prehistoric Painting Of Bhimbetka''. 1984, page 25&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Bhimbetka'' is said to derive from ''Bhimbaithka'' (भीमबैठका), meaning "sitting place of Bhima".&lt;ref name=mathpal /&gt;

== Location ==
{{double image|right|Path way Bhembetika (2).jpg|160|Information Palette Bhimbetka (3).jpg|160|Bhimbetka location}}
The Rock Shelters of Bhimbetaka (or Bhim Baithaka) is 45 kilometers southeast of [[Bhopal]] and 9&amp;nbsp;km from [[Obedullaganj]] city in the [[Raisen District]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]] at the southern edge of the [[Vindhya Range|Vindhya]] hills. South of these rock shelters are successive ranges of the [[Satpura]] hills. It is inside the ''[[Ratapani Wildlife Sanctuary]]'', embedded in sandstone rocks, in the foothills of the Vindhya Range.&lt;ref name=britannicabhimbetka&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/place/Bhimbetka-rock-shelters Bhimbetka rock shelters], Encyclopaedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/925.pdf Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka: Continuity through Antiquity, Art &amp; Environment], Archaeological Survey of India, UNESCO, pages 14–18, 22–23, 30–33&lt;/ref&gt; The site consists of seven hills: Vinayaka, Bhonrawali, Bhimbetka, Lakha Juar (east and west), Jhondra and Muni Babaki Pahari.&lt;ref name="PeregrineEmber2003p315"/&gt;

== History ==
[[File:1 of the rock shelter caves at Bhimbetka, Madhya Pradesh.jpg|thumb|One of about 750 rock shelter caves at Bhimbetka.]]

W. Kincaid, a British India era official, first mentioned Bhimbetka in a scholarly paper in 1888. He relied on the information he gathered from local [[adivasi]]s (tribals) about Bhojpur lake in the area and referred to Bhimbetka as a [[Buddhist]] site.&lt;ref name=asiunesco54&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/925.pdf Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka: Continuity through Antiquity, Art &amp; Environment], Archaeological Survey of India, UNESCO, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; The first archaeologist to visit a few caves at the site and discover its prehistoric significance was [[V. S. Wakankar]], who saw these rock formations and thought these were similar to those he had seen in Spain and France. He visited the area with a team of archaeologists and reported several prehistoric rock shelters in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=925|title=Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka|publisher=World Heritage Site|accessdate=2007-02-15| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070308082739/http://whc.unesco.org/pg.cfm?cid=31&amp;id_site=925| archivedate= 8 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only in the 1970s that the scale and true significance of the Bhimbetka rock shelters was discovered and reported.&lt;ref name=asiunesco54/&gt; Since then, more than 750 rock shelters have been identified. The Bhimbetka group contains 243 of these, while the Lakha Juar group nearby has 178 shelters. According to Archaeological Survey of India, the evidence suggests that there has been a continuous human settlement here from the [[Stone Age]] through the late [[Acheulian]] to the late [[Mesolithic]] until the 2nd-century BCE in these hills. This is based on excavations at the site, the discovered artifacts and wares, pigments in deposits, as well as the rock paintings.&lt;ref name=bhimbetka15&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/925.pdf Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka: Continuity through Antiquity, Art &amp; Environment], Archaeological Survey of India, UNESCO, pages 15–16, 22–23, 45, 54–60&lt;/ref&gt;

The site contains the world’s oldest stone walls and floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Indian Rock Art and Its Global Context|author1=Kalyan Kumar Chakravarty|author2=Robert G. Bednarik|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barkheda, Raisen|Barkheda]] has been identified as the source of the raw materials used in some of the monoliths discovered at Bhimbetka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/925.pdf | title = Bhimbetka (India) No. 925 | publisher = UNESCO World Heritage Centre | accessdate = 2012-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site consisting of 1,892 hectares was declared as protected under Indian laws and came under the management of the Archaeological Survey of India in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/uploads/nominations/925.pdf Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka: Continuity through Antiquity, Art &amp; Environment], Archaeological Survey of India, UNESCO, pages 10, 53&lt;/ref&gt; It was declared as a world heritage site by UNESCO in 2003.&lt;ref name=britannicabhimbetka/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_rockart_bhimbetka.asp World Heritage Sites – Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka], Archaeological Survey of India&lt;/ref&gt;

== Auditorium cave ==
{{double image|right|Entrance of bhimbetka.jpg|160|Entry to "Auditorium Cave".jpg|160|Bhimbetka quartzite towers.|Auditorium cave.}}
Of the numerous shelters, the Auditorium cave is one of the significant features of the site. Surrounded by quartzite towers which are visible from several kilometers distance, the Auditorium rock is the largest shelter at Bhimbetka. Robert Bednarik describes the prehistoric Auditorium cave as one with a "cathedral-like" atmosphere, with "its Gothic arches and soaring spaces".&lt;ref name=bednarik63/&gt; Its plan resembles a "right-angled cross" with four of its branches aligned to the four cardinal directions. The main entrance points to the east. At the end of this eastern passage, at the cave's entrance, is a boulder with a near-vertical panel that is distinctive, one visible from distance and all directions. In archaeology literature, this boulder has been dubbed as "Chief's Rock" or "King's Rock", though there is no evidence of any rituals or its role as such.&lt;ref name=bednarik63/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bednarik (1993), Palaeolithic Art in India, ''Man and Environment'', Volume 18, Number 2, pages 33–40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Singh | first=Manoj Kumar | title=Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology | chapter=Bhimbetka Rockshelters | publisher=Springer New York | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4419-0426-3 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0465-2_2286 | pages=867–870}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boulder with the Auditorium Cave is the central feature of the Bhimbetka, midst its 754 numbered shelters spread over few kilometers on either side, and nearly 500 locations where rock paintings can be found, states Bednarik.&lt;ref name=bednarik63&gt;Robert G Bednarik (1996), The cupules on Chief's Rock, Auditorium Cave, Bhimbetka, The Artifact: Journal of the Archaeological and Anthropological Society of Victoria, Volume 19, pages 63–71&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rock art and paintings ==

[[File:Bhimbetka_Natraj_painting.jpg|thumb|upright|An eroded painting in the Bhimbetka caves shows "Nataraj" dancing and holding a ''trishula'' or trident.]]

The rock shelters and caves of Bhimbetka have a large number of  paintings. The oldest paintings are found to be 30,000 years old, but some of the geometric figures date to as recently as the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]]. The colors used are vegetable colors which have endured through time because the drawings were generally made deep inside a niche or on inner walls. The drawings and paintings can be classified under seven different periods.

'''Period I''' – ([[Upper Paleolithic]]): These are linear representations, in green and dark red, of huge figures of animals such as [[bison]], [[tiger]]s and [[rhinoceros]]es.

'''Period II''' – ([[Mesolithic]]): Comparatively small in size the stylised figures in this group show linear decorations on the body.  In addition to animals there are human figures and hunting scenes, giving a clear picture of the weapons they used: barbed [[spear]]s, pointed sticks, [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]].&lt;ref name=bhim3/&gt;&lt;ref name=bhim1/&gt;&lt;ref name=bhim2/&gt; Some scenes are interpreted as depicting tribal war between three tribes symbolised by their animal totems.&lt;ref name="PeregrineEmber2003p315"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=South Asian Prehistory: A Multidisciplinary study|author=D.

'''Period III''' – ([[Chalcolithic]]) Similar to the paintings of the Mesolithic, these drawings reveal that during this period the cave dwellers of this area were in contact with the agricultural communities of the [[Malwa]] plains, exchanging goods with them.

'''Period IV &amp; V''' – (Early historic): The figures of this group have a schematic and decorative style and are painted mainly in red, white and yellow. The association is of riders, depiction of religious symbols, tunic-like dresses and the existence of scripts of different periods. The religious beliefs are represented by figures of [[yaksha]]s, tree gods and magical sky chariots.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

'''Period VI &amp; VII''' – (Medieval) : These paintings are geometric linear and more schematic, but they show degeneration and crudeness in their artistic style. The colors used by the cave dwellers were prepared by combining black [[manganese oxide]]s, red [[hematite]] and [[charcoal]].

One rock, popularly referred to as “Zoo Rock”, depicts [[elephant]]s, [[barasingha]] (swamp deer), [[bison]] and [[deer]]. Paintings on another rock show a [[peacock]], a [[snake]], a deer and the sun. On another rock, two elephants with tusks are painted. Hunting scenes with hunters carrying bows, arrows, swords and shields also find their place in the community of these pre-historic paintings. In one of the caves, a bison is shown in pursuit of a hunter while his two companions appear to stand helplessly nearby; in another, some horsemen are seen, along with archers. In one painting, a large wild boar is seen.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}&lt;!-- Which period?!? --&gt;

The paintings are classified largely in two groups, one as depiction of hunters and food gatherers, while other one as fighters, riding on horses and elephant carrying metal weapons. the first group of paintings dates to prehistoric times while second one dates to historic times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Prehistoric Painting Of Bhimbetka|page=225|publisher=Abhinav Publications|year=1984|first=Yashodhar|last=Mathpal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Javidp20&gt;{{cite book| author =Javid, Ali and Javeed, Tabassum |title=World Heritage Monuments and Related Edifices in India|publisher=Algora Publishing|year= 2008|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the paintings from historic period depicts battles between the rulers carrying swords, spears, bows and arrows.&lt;ref name=Javidp20/&gt;

In one of the desolate rock shelters, the painting of a man holding a trident-like staff and dancing has been named "[[Nataraj]]" by archaeologist [[V. S. Wakankar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Rock-art of India: Paintings and Engravings|page=123|publisher=Arnold-Heinemann|first=Kalyan Kumar|last=Chakravarty|quote=Nataraj figures from BHIM III E-19 and one from III F −16 are well decorated in fierce mood.

"'''Big Beautiful Woman'''" (commonly abbreviated as '''BBW''') is a euphemism for an overweight woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schwimmer|first=Jeffrey|title=Preventing Childhood Obesity: Health in the Balance|pmc=1281327|publisher=National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine|page=A706|volume=113|issue=10|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|doi=10.1289/ehp.113-a706a|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms "Big Beautiful Women" and "BBW" were coined by Carole Shaw in 1979, when she launched ''BBW Magazine'', a fashion and [[lifestyle magazine]] for "[[Plus-size model|plus-size]]" women.&lt;ref name=BBWMH&gt;{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=BBW Past &amp; Present |url=http://www.bbwmagazine.com/bbw-past-present/|accessdate=2015-08-05 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Meaning==
[[File:Fa attraction.svg|thumb|Physical attraction of 47 male fat admirers (FA) towards 10 female figures from the given [[Body mass index|BMI]] range, compared with a control group (CG)]]
The term is a subjective, visually determined concept that does not have an explicit lower or upper weight limitation, and may denote women who may be considered barely overweight to those who are [[morbidly obese]]. A 2009 study found that male fat admirers preferred females that were clinically overweight and rated both overweight and obese women more positively than slighter individuals. The study also found that participants reacted more positively to a much wider range of figures than a control group, even rating emaciated figures higher. It concludes "these findings suggest that an explanation for fat admiration may be that FAs are rejecting sociocultural norms of attractiveness".&lt;ref name="Swami"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Swami|first=Viren|date=1 January 2009|title=Big beautiful women: the body size preferences of male fat admirers|url=https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/m.j.tovee/Swami+Tovee-2009.pdf|journal=The Journal of Sex Research|volume=46|issue=1|pages=89–96|doi=10.1080/00224490802645302|pmid=19116865|author2=Tovee, Martin J.|accessdate=25 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623142133/https://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/m.j.tovee/Swami%2BTovee-2009.pdf|archivedate=23 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has several near-synonyms with varying shades of meaning:
*''Full-figured'' or ''Rubenesque'' - the latter term referring to the art of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], best known for portraying full-bodied women.
*''[[wikt:voluptuous|voluptuous]]'' and ''[[wikt:zaftig|zaftig]]'' usually connote ripeness, sensuality, and a [[body shape]] involving large breasts and wide hips, although in such women the [[waist-hip ratio]] is generally smaller indicating only slightly overweight or normal weight status

==Usage==
Although "BBW" may have been first used in the context of BBW Magazine, the term's usage spread over the years, to the point that even women who had never heard of the magazine began to refer to themselves as "BBWs".

{{wikinews|Obesity and the Fat Acceptance Movement: Kira Nerusskaya speaks}}

Some women may adopt the term as a personal preference over the term ''Rubenesque'', or ''full-figured'', because they may not necessarily have large breasts or hips. Such terms, and others such as "[[Bed (furniture)#Standard sizes|queen-sized]]", "[[Plus-size model|plus-sized]]", or "fat" may lead to feelings of marginalization or non-inclusion for some women. However, some strongly prefer the term ''fat'' over other words which they consider unnecessary [[euphemism]]s.

The abbreviation BBW can often be found used in [[personal ad]]s (and [[online dating service]]s) denoting an identification with (or preference for) such women, and is also used to denote events specifically targeted to such women, and persons interested in them, such as specific gathering nights in dance clubs, restaurants, and fashion stores and shows.

The term is also commonly used as a positive euphemism by those involved with the [[fat acceptance movement]].

== Websites ==
There are a wide range of websites dedicated to the topic of big beautiful woman, including sites which are dedicated to sending out a size-positive message towards larger women, some of which denounce the dieting industry as encouraging women to lose weight to conform to what is considered the ideal by mainstream society. Big beautiful women are also on a number of [[pornographic]] websites which may include content which is [[sexual fetish|sexually fetishistic]] in nature (including [[fat fetishism]] and [[Fat fetishism#Feederism|feederism]]).

== Variants ==
The acronym BBBW refers to Big Beautiful Black Woman.  Another variant is SSBBW: Super-Size Big Beautiful Woman. There is much debate on a definition for a Super-Size Big Beautiful Woman.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

While "Big Beautiful Woman" may be prevalent in the Americas and Europe, in Asian countries where obesity may be considered uncommon or deemed unhealthy, other terms are used.  For example, in Japan the term ''[[wikt:en:debu#Japanese|debu]]'' (''katakana'' [[wikt:en:デブ#Japanese|デブ]], ''hiragana'' [[wikt:en:でぶ#Japanese|でぶ]]) is used, but usually with a pejorative meaning, whereas ''[[wikt:en:でぶ専#Japanese|debusen]]'' is the most common term used for sexual attraction to obese individuals. ''[[wikt:en:プランパー#Japanese|Plumper]]'', on the other hand, is a fetish in the popular ''[[bakunyū]]'' market of the pornographic scene.

===Big Handsome Man===
''Big Handsome Man'' (BHM), or ''Big Hulking Men'', or sometimes ''Big Beautiful Man'' (BBM),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NATB&amp;p_theme=natb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=12206D27A55B1088&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |publisher=North Adams Transcript |title=On the sunny side of the street |date=16 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a physically or sexually attractive fat man. These men are large to extremely large. There are many subcategories of BHMs.  Some are men who just happen to be large, while others attempt to become fatter.  Some of these men are insecure about their size, while others embrace their [[obesity]] and feel confident.  Women who are attracted to BHMs are called ''Female Fat Admirers'' (FFA). In the gay community, BHMs are called [[chub (gay culture)|Chubs]], and men who are attracted to BHMs are known as [[Chubby chaser]]s.

The '''Braganza Brooch''' is a gold ornamental [[fibula (brooch)|fibula]] that was made in the third century BC by a Greek craftsman for an Iberian client.  Since its discovery in unknown circumstances in the nineteenth century, it has belonged to a variety of owners before being purchased by the [[British Museum]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=467441&amp;partId=1&amp;people=31892&amp;peoA=31892-3-18&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;.

==Description==
This heavy gold brooch is dominated by the figure of a naked warrior who wears a [[Celts|Celtic]] helmet and protects himself with a Celtic shield and sword from a hunting dog which jumps up to him. Each end of the fibula is decorated by a dog's head and it once furnished a spring and pin which is now lost. The form, style and technique suggest that it was made in the third century BC by a Greek jeweller for a Celtic patron who lived on the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. Contemporary Iberian brooches were usually made of silver and were often decorated with warriors on horseback accompanied by hunting dogs. In this unique gold version, the craftsman has simplified the hunting scene and added a boar's head, which once served as the sliding catch for the now missing pin. The brooch measures approximately 14&amp;nbsp;cm long.

==Ownership of the Brooch==
The brooch was once in the collection of the Royal [[House of Braganza]] and was perhaps collected by [[Fernando II of Portugal|Fernando II]], consort of Queen Maria of Portugal. Most of the jewellery of the Braganza dynasty was inherited in 1919 by HRH Nevada of Portugal, Princess d'Braganza and Duchesse d'Oporto who later emigrated to America. On her death in 1941, the collection was sold to Warren Piper of Chicago. The brooch was in turn purchased by Thomas F Flannery Jr in 1950. After being loaned to the British Museum for 7 years, it was purchased by the museum in 2001.

[[File:Rectangular Tray (Changfang Pan) with Sword-Pommel Pattern LACMA M.79.89.2.jpg|thumb|''Changfang Pan'' (rectangular tray) with Sword-Pommel Pattern, black with red layers, Middle Ming, about 1450–1550]]
&lt;!-- no infobox please! --&gt;
'''Carved lacquer''' or  '''Qīdiāo''' ({{zh|漆雕}}) is a distinctive Chinese form of decorated [[lacquerware]].  While lacquer has been used in China for at least 3,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt; the technique of carving into very thick coatings of it appears to have been developed in the 12th century CE. It is extremely time-consuming to produce, and has always been a luxury product, essentially restricted to China,&lt;ref&gt;Grove; Cinnabar&lt;/ref&gt; though imitated in [[Japanese lacquerware|Japanese lacquer]] in somewhat different styles.  The producing process is called '''Diāoqī''' ({{lang|zh|雕漆}}, carving lacquer).

Though most surviving examples are from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] dynasties, the main types of subject matter for the carvings were all begun under the [[Song dynasty]], and the development of both these and the technique of carving were essentially over by the early Ming.  These types were the abstract ''guri'' or Sword-Pommel pattern, figures in a landscape, and birds and plants.  To these some designs with religious symbols, animals, auspicious characters ''(right)'' and imperial dragons can be added.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Oval Tray (Duoyuan Pan) with Pavilion on a Garden Terrace LACMA M.81.125.1.jpg|thumb|''Tuoyuan pan'' (oval tray) with people in a landscape, 24.5 cm wide, Yuan]]

The objects made in the technique are a wide range of small types, but are mostly practical vessels or containers such as boxes, plates and trays. Some screens and pieces of [[Chinese furniture]] were made. Carved lacquer is only rarely combined with painting in lacquer and other lacquer techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Later Chinese writers dated the introduction of carved lacquer to the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–906), and many modern writers have pointed to some late Tang pieces of armour found on the [[Silk Road]] by [[Aurel Stein]] and now in the [[British Museum]].  These are red and black lacquer on [[camel]] hide, but the lacquer is very thin, "less than one millimeter in thickness", and the effect very different, with simple abstract shapes on a plain field and almost no impression of [[relief]].&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 6–7 (7 quoted); [http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=228794&amp;partId=1&amp;searchText=Lacquer+armour+aurel+Stein&amp;page=1 British Museum collection database], see "Curator's comments"; Kuwayama, 13–14; Rawson, 175; Grove, "Tang"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song dynasty, and the main types of subject matter===
[[File:Foliated Dish (Pan) with Sword-Pommel Pattern LACMA M.87.203.jpg|thumb|Foliated dish or tray in the ''tixi'' technique with the ''guri'' or "Sword-Pommel Pattern", here using red with three thin layers of black. The polished top layer of red contrasts with the duller bottom layer. Early Ming.]] 
The style of carving into thick lacquer used later is first seen in the [[Southern Song]] (1127–1279), following the development of techniques for making very thick lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 7; Rawson, 175&lt;/ref&gt;  There is some evidence from literary sources that it had existed in the late Tang.&lt;ref&gt;Kuwayama, 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;  At first the style of decoration used is known as ''guri'' ({{lang|zh|屈輪}}) from the Japanese word for the ring-pommel of a sword, where the same motifs were used in metal, and is often called the "Sword-Pommel pattern" in English.  This style uses a family of repeated two-branched scrolling shapes cut with a rounded profile at the surface, but below that a "V" section through layers of lacquer in different colours (black, red and yellow, and later green), giving a "marbled" effect from the contrasted colours; this technique is called ''tìxī'' ({{lang|zh|剔犀}}) in Chinese.  This style continued to be used up to the [[Ming dynasty]], especially on small boxes and jars with covers, though after the Song only red was often used, and the motifs were often carved with wider flat spaces at the bottom level to be exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 26–27, 46–61, 60 for the use of green; Rawson, 178; Grove, "Song"; Kuwayama, 13–17 on the Song&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Song carved lacquer to survive is in the ''guri'' and ''tixi'' style and technique,&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 29&lt;/ref&gt; but the period also saw the development of a pictorial style, and the beginning of the two other main streams of [[iconography]] that were to dominate the rest of the history of carved lacquer, though surviving examples from the Song are rare.  Both relate to [[Chinese art]] in other media, and use the existing vocabulary of Chinese ornament for borders.  The first type of subject is scenes of people in a landscape, derived mainly from [[Chinese painting]] and woodcut book illustrations; such scenes were only later to be found in [[Chinese ceramics]]. The settings quickly became fairly standardized, with a few figures close to one or more buildings, in a garden setting, perhaps near water or a road (the English [[chinoiserie]] "[[Willow pattern]]" is just such a scene). A convention developed by which the areas of sky, water and land (floor or ground) left largely blank in paintings are filled in with discreet patterns derived from textiles, known as "[[brocade]]-grounds" and also "[[Diapering|diaper]] backgrounds"; this convention has continued to modern times.  Standard groups of patterns for each type are followed in work from the imperial workshops, but may be mixed up in work from the commercial workshops.  The precise form of patterns used can be a factor in dating pieces,&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 29, 105; Garner (1966), throughout&lt;/ref&gt; but in general "The background diaper of sky consisted of looping clouds, diapers representing water were cut in rhomboid curves for waves, and the land and paving had diapers with geometricized flowers".&lt;ref&gt;Grove, "Ming"&lt;/ref&gt;

The other main type of subject was birds against a foliage background that filled the whole carved area, or just flowers and foliage treated in the same way. Dragons and phoenixes were also treated in this style, and became very prominent in Ming imperial works (see below).  A design of this type known as the "two birds" was especially successful aesthetically and often used; in later examples the birds are often the [[fenghuang]] or Chinese phoenix.  The style continued to develop until reaching its finest period in the early Ming dynasty, and has continued to be produced.  Plant decoration of this sort was later generally used to fill in borders and other spaces around other types of subject, such as the edges and legs of furniture.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 30, 32–33, 86, examples at 62–113; Rawson, 178&lt;/ref&gt;  This style relates to a broad tradition of Chinese ornament reaching back into Chinese antiquity in stone reliefs, metalwork and other media, including ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[Jessica Rawson|Rawson, Jessica]], ''Chinese Ornament: The Lotus and the Dragon'', 1984, British Museum Publications, {{ISBN|0714114316}}, on the whole subject, especially Chapter 3 on animals, and pp. 99–107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacquer was among the luxury products often given by the emperor as diplomatic or political gifts, or to the subsidiary courts of princes of the imperial house. Japanese collections, often accumulated in temples, have a high proportion of the surviving early Chinese carved lacquer pieces.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 8–10, 27&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Engaku-ji]] temple in [[Kamakura]] has an especially important group of pieces, some of which are credibly reputed to have been brought to Japan by its founder, a refugee monk escaping the fall of the Song dynasty to the Mongols in 1279.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 27, 74, 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Yuan dynasty the development of Song styles continued, especially from about 1320, after something of a hiatus (as also seen in other arts).&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 28&lt;/ref&gt;   Pieces in the Sword-Pommel pattern have more rounded tops to the ridges, and more narrow bottoms.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;  The artistic quality of carving was perhaps never higher, in all the main streams of iconography: Sword-Pommel pattern, birds, flowers and foliage, and figures in landscapes.  In the crowded, "exuberant and complex" designs with birds and plants, the forms overlap and curl in a more sculptural fashion, allowed by slightly thicker lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 28 (quoted); Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late Yuan the reputation of individual masters has come down to us, although few pieces are signed and even these cannot be very confidently assigned to an artist, as the signatures may not be genuine.  Yang Mao and Zhang Cheng were the most famous masters, both from [[Jiaxing]] in the southern province of [[Zhejiang]].&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 28, 54–55, 68–69; Grove is more confident&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese diplomatic gifts to the Japanese government in the early Ming are especially well-documented on the Japanese side, at a time when the [[Ashikaga shogunate]] was enjoying a period of improved relations with China. In 1403 a consignment of luxury goods, also including [[Chinese silk]]s and lacquered [[Chinese furniture]], had 58 pieces of carved red lacquerware in a range of shapes. Lists with descriptions and measurements that allow some surviving pieces to be identified also survive from 1406, 1407, 1433 and 1434.  These confirm that carved red lacquer was already "the favored type of lacquer for court use" by this point.&lt;ref&gt;Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 267; Watt and Ford, 30–31 (30 quoted)&lt;/ref&gt;

Most early production of lacquer had been in the more suitable hot and moist climate of the south,&lt;ref&gt;Grove, "Qing and after (from 1644)"; Map in Watt and Ford, 5&lt;/ref&gt; but from the early Ming onwards the finest work was often from official workshops in Beijing, and the best early Ming work is "technically ... as near perfection as has ever been possible".&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 86&lt;/ref&gt;  The "Orchard Factory" was founded around 1416 in [[Lingjing hutong]] in [[Beijing]], near the [[Forbidden City]].  It used imported workers from the south, the masters from [[Jiaxing]] in [[Zhejiang]] province, and other workers from [[Yunnan]] and [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref&gt;Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101&lt;/ref&gt;  As part of the internal tax or tribute system, about 5,000 workers from the south were required to work in the imperial workshops for terms of four years.&lt;ref&gt;Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 107&lt;/ref&gt;  The raw lacquer was also imported from the south, as the [[Chinese lacquer tree]] will not grow as far north as Beijing.  But the Orchard Factory closed in 1436, after only some 20 years of operations.&lt;ref&gt;Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101&lt;/ref&gt;  The production of imperial wares seems to have lapsed between 1436 and 1522, after another Mongol invasion, from which lacquer production took longer to recover than [[Jingdezhen porcelain]].&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 32&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chinese lacquerware table.jpg|thumb|The [[Chinese lacquerware table|Ming table]] in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], 1425–1436]]

In the Ming period the [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] became a key imperial symbol, very often appearing on lacquer from the imperial workshops for the use of the court, or made to be given by the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the dragon's head was seen in the traditional profile but in the middle of the 15th century the "frontal" dragon, seen looking out full-face at the viewer, was introduced and soon became the norm in lacquer as in other media.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 104&lt;/ref&gt;

By at least the Ming dynasty carved lacquer was being used all over the visible surfaces of pieces of furniture, a dauntingly expensive proposition. One of the best known pieces is a [[Chinese lacquerware table|desk-sized table]] with three drawers in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London, whose top has a typical imperial Ming design with a central dragon and phoenix, symbolizing the emperor and empress respectively.  The table-top measures 119.5&amp;nbsp;cm by 84.5&amp;nbsp;cm and it was produced between 1425–1436 in the "Orchard Factory", and is the only piece of its size to survive from their production, the best period of Ming workmanship.  As with many other pieces, the ground of the relief was originally a yellow that contrasted with the red of the upper layers, but has now faded to a dark colour.&lt;ref&gt;Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 107; Watt and Ford, 86; [https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O75869/table-unknown/ "Summary" and "More information"] on the V&amp;A page on the table (use the tabs); see Garner (1966), 184–185 on yellow backgrounds&lt;/ref&gt;  Black grounds under red carved layers were also common from this period, but in some cases what now appears black may originally have been green.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 92&lt;/ref&gt;  A less common type, often of very high quality, has black upper layers on a red ground.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 81–82&lt;/ref&gt;

From about 1400, the "brocade-ground" patterns already used for floors and sky in scenes of figures in a landscape were also used in depicting plant designs, both on the backgrounds and on the leaves or fruits of the plants themselves, "a curious development".  More logically, they were also used for the background of non-representational designs such as characters of Chinese script.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Though sometimes used earlier,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajspeelman.com/archive_details.php?sid=398 "Cinnabar polychrome carved lacquer dish, Yuan dynasty, 14th century, China"], A&amp;J Speelman&lt;/ref&gt; polychrome carved lacquer in a variety of the ''tixi'' technique was only prominent during the period between the Jiajing Emperor and Wanli Emperor (1521–1620).  This involved carving different parts of the image down to expose a layer in a different colour, so building up a coloured image.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 34, 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Another imperial factory was founded beside the Forbidden City in 1680 under the [[Qing dynasty]] by the [[Kangxi Emperor]] and was still producing under the [[Qianlong Emperor]] (1736–95),&lt;ref&gt;Osborne 525&lt;/ref&gt; "one of the most prodigal spenders in Chinese history" and a great lover of carved lacquer. Referring to the traditional complaints, stretching back to the [[Han dynasty]],&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 18&lt;/ref&gt; about the cost to the imperial budget of "ordinary" lacquerware, he had a carved Ming piece in the imperial collection engraved with an inscription beginning "Lacquer is cause for ten officials to complain; what if it is also carved?".&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 9&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chinese carved cinnabar lacquerware.jpg|thumb|A pair of vases, late [[Qing dynasty]]. Adilnor Collection, Sweden.]]
By the Qing period the repertoire of subjects for carved lacquer was essentially complete, but one addition in the Qianlong reign was a few pieces showing foreigners, mostly Central Asians bearing tribute though landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christies]], see Lot Essays: [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/a-rare-pair-of-large-carved-four-color-5182126-details.aspx A RARE PAIR OF LARGE CARVED FOUR-COLOR LACQUER CIRCULAR BOXES AND COVERS, Lot 591, Sale 2269], "Fine Chinese Ceramics &amp; Works of Art Including Jades from the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco", 19 March 2009, New York; [http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/a-very-rare-imperial-carved-three-colour-lacquer-5001487-details.aspx?from=salesummery&amp;intobjectid=5001487&amp;sid=406b0b24-9990-4eb3-95e2-91719e121b2b A VERY RARE IMPERIAL CARVED THREE-COLOUR LACQUER FLORAL-SHAPED BOX AND COVER, Lot 1667, Sale 2389], "Important Chinese Ceramics and Works of Art", 27 November 2007, Hong Kong.&lt;/ref&gt; Combination techniques of other techniques sometimes included carving, but more often slightly raised areas built up by applying fillers to the base surface before the lacquer was applied.&lt;ref&gt;Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of the Qianlong Emperor both the quality and quantity of imperial production sharply declined, and has never reached the previous standard again.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 37; Grove&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing process==

[[File:Chinese carved lacquer tray, Yuan dynasty (1260-1368), Honolulu Academy of Arts.JPG|thumb|"Two birds" tray in black lacquer, Yuan (1260–1368)]]

The [[lacquer]], sap from the ''[[Toxicodendron vernicifluum]]'' lacquer tree that is native to China, is mixed with colourings, with the usual colours being red from [[cinnabar]], by far the most common, black from [[carbon]] (probably [[Chinese ink]] and [[soot]]),&lt;ref&gt;Burmester, 178&lt;/ref&gt; and a yellow or [[Buff (colour)|buff]] from [[orpiment]],&lt;ref&gt;Burmester, 175; [http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/journals/conservation-journal/issue-01/the-conservation-of-oriental-lacquer/ "The conservation of Oriental lacquer"], V&amp;A Conservation Journal; Cinnabar&lt;/ref&gt; which is liable to fade to a dark colour and is often now hardly apparent.  There appears to have been a change in the early Ming from using red from natural mineral cinnabar to synthetic [[vermilion]].&lt;ref&gt;Burmester, 176–177; Garner (1963), 90–92&lt;/ref&gt;  Some time after this, the colouring of the red changed from the previous brownish-red shade to a "bright scarlet", for reasons that remain unclear.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (1963), 93–96&lt;/ref&gt;    The chemistry of other common pigments known to the Chinese at this period appears to have made them unsuitable for use in lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;Burmester, 178; Garner (1963), 90&lt;/ref&gt;

The base is usually of wood, though other materials may be used. Often the base of flatter pieces is made of two pieces of wood glued one on top of the other, with their grains running at right angles to each other.  This helps the finished piece withstand stresses from different directions. Nonetheless, early pieces often show some warping and cracking.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 62–63, 70&lt;/ref&gt;  The wood was often covered with a glued-on coarse cloth made from [[ramie]] or [[hemp]] before the lacquer was applied.&lt;ref&gt;Garner (1963), 87, 96–97&lt;/ref&gt;

The base is coated with a succession of coats or layers of lacquer, each of which must be allowed to dry and harden slowly in a warm temperature of 70º to 80° [[Fahrenheit]] /20º to 25º Celsius with high humidity (75% to 85%) before the next is applied.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  The drying time for each coat has been said to take weeks,&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 175 ("each coat taking weeks to dry and harden thoroughly")&lt;/ref&gt; "several days",&lt;ref&gt;Garner (1963), 88&lt;/ref&gt; 48 hours,&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 7&lt;/ref&gt; or a day.&lt;ref&gt;Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101 ("up to twenty-four hours"); Grove&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been noted that "there is a great diversity in the literature .... about the numbers of layers involved.  Estimates ...vary between a few and over 300".&lt;ref&gt;Burmester, 176&lt;/ref&gt; It is often stated that the number of coats in the best quality pieces reaches into the low hundreds,&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 7; Rawson, 176 ("Chinese lacquer usually consists of hundreds of layers"); Grove ("Carved lacquerware of the early Ming had well over 100 layers of extremely thin lacquer, sometimes less than 0.05 mm thick.); Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101 ("some of the palace items having up to one hundred layers"), repeated 107, specifically referring to the V&amp;A table; Garner (1963), 88 ("may exceed one hundred")&lt;/ref&gt; though it has also been said that microscopic examination of pieces does not support such high numbers,&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 43 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rp5JklFUpacC&amp;pg=PA43 google books]; see  Garner (1963), 92–96 on the study of the layers under a microscope&lt;/ref&gt;

The lacquer is then carved with knives and other metal tools.  Usually the general large areas of the composition were carved down to the right level first, then the main forms followed by the details, and lastly the patterns in the backgrounds.  Finally any polishing needed is done; the best pieces had also been polished after each coat was hard.  Modern works often use a number of shortcuts, including starting with carving most of the design in relief on the base wood, so greatly reducing the depth of actual lacquer required (this has been also been done in the Japanese ''[[kamakura-bori]]'' technique since around the 15th century &lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 179 (Japan)&lt;/ref&gt;).  Additives are also added in large amounts to the lacquer, or cast resin or other materials used instead.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, 43; Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays there are less than 20 ''diaoqi'' masters who can still perform the craft.&lt;ref&gt;Today, there are probably less than 20 people who are still living with the lacquer carving skill. Probably less than 4 people who can really pass the skill to next generation.

==Uses==
Lacquerware has been described as "not unlike modern plastic in that it is light, durable and clean".&lt;ref&gt;Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101&lt;/ref&gt;  Other types of lacquerware were widely used as tablewares, but the pictorial style of carved lacquer is less suitable for this, with intricate sunk corners that would be hard to clean of wet food remains.  Partly for this reason, wide flattish shapes that are called dishes in other media, such as ceramics, tend to be rather more flat and to be called "trays" when in lacquer. Nonetheless there is evidence that carved lacquer was used for serving food.  Ming paintings of court scenes show food for "imperial picnics" being carried by court eunuchs in round lidded boxes in carved lacquer, a common shape that can reach nearly 40&amp;nbsp;cm across.&lt;ref&gt;Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 101; Watt and Ford, 149&lt;/ref&gt;  The interior of these is almost always plain lacquer, greatly reducing the problem of keeping them clean, and the food itself may have been wrapped or in ceramic containers.  A [[Yongle Emperor|Yongle]] reign dish or tray 35&amp;nbsp;cm wide, probably made at the Orchard Factory and now in the [[British Museum]], has a rare inscription indicating the use of the piece, as it declares it the property of the "Imperial Household Department of Sweetmeats and Delicacies".&lt;ref&gt;Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacquer was more often used for cup-stands (or bowl-stands), a sort of saucer with an integral raised hollow tube at the centre to hold the cup,&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 86; Rawson, 176; Clunas and Harrison-Hall, 267&lt;/ref&gt; than actual cups, but sometimes the exterior of these is carved lacquer, especially in the ''guri'' style, while the interior lacquer is smooth.  As in other materials, there is a considerable overlap between the pieces used for serving and drinking tea, wine, and other drinks.

Items for the scholar's desk, including brush pens with their matching covers,&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 46–47, 89&lt;/ref&gt; were often made in carved lacquer, as were those for the male and female toilet.  The "Studio of the Three Rarities", the Qianlong Emperor's study in his main Beijing apartments, had an elaborate writing set in carved lacquer and other materials, including some of the visual tricks he enjoyed, such as a lacquer and ivory "book" that was actually a box containing his [[rhyming dictionary]].&lt;ref&gt;Rawski and Rawson, 303, 449&lt;/ref&gt;  Many smaller round boxes are described in the literature as "[[incense]] boxes", and a type of late Ming rectangular box with rounded corners was apparently mainly or initially used for the ceremonial presentation of documents or gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Watt and Ford, 102&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Craig Clunas]] suggests that in looking at pictorial scenes, we should be alert to possible connections in what may seem general genre scenes to specific major life events, as such pieces were used and reused among the elite to carry and themselves to be gifts on such occasions as a marriage, birth of a child, birthday, passing the Imperial examinations, moving house, promotion and retirement.  Specific episodes from the history of famous literati or literature may be intended; in paintings such subjects are likely to be made clear by inscriptions, but not on lacquer.&lt;ref&gt;Clunas 2, 57–69&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to presentation pieces, boxes in all types of lacquer were used in elite society as containers to send gifts of food, where the recipient was intended, after admiring the container, to send it back containing another gift.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, 158&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Georgin François, The 3 Roads to Eternity, 1825 Cornell CUL PJM 1040 01.jpg|thumbnail|This is a folk-art allegorical map based on Matthew 7:13–14 Bible Gateway by the woodcutter Georgin François in 1825.]]
In [[New Testament]] Greek, the Hebrew phrase "לא־תעזב נפשׁי לשׁאול" (you will not abandon my soul to ''Sheol'') in {{bibleverse||Psalm|16:10}} is quoted in {{bibleverse||Acts|2:27}} as "οὐκ ἐγκαταλείψεις τὴν ψυχήν μου εἰς ᾅδου" (you will not abandon my soul to ''Hades'').

In the [[Textus Receptus]] version of the New Testament, on which the English [[King James Version]] is based, the word "ᾅδης" (Hades), appears 11 times;&lt;ref name ="Blueletter"&gt;[http://cf.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?Strongs=G86&amp;t=kjv Blue Letter Bible. "Dictionary and Word Search for hadēs (Strong's 86)"]&lt;/ref&gt; but critical editions of the text of {{Bibleverse|1|Corinthians|15:55}} have "θάνατος" (death) in place of "ᾅδης".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/GNT/Corinth1.html Greek New Testament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108054407/http://www-user.uni-bremen.de/~wie/GNT/Corinth1.html |date=2008-11-08 }}; cf. [http://www.biblicaltheology.org/hades.pdf The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Vol. II:1314–1315 (1915)]&lt;/ref&gt; Except in this verse of 1 Corinthians, where it uses "grave", the King James Version translates "ᾅδης" as "hell". Modern translations, for which there are only 10 instances of the word "ᾅδης" in the New Testament, generally transliterate it as "Hades". 

In all appearances but one, "ᾅδης" has little if any relation to [[afterlife]] rewards or punishments. The one exception is Luke's parable of [[Lazarus and Dives|Lazarus and the rich man]], in which the rich man finds himself, after death, in Hades,&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|16:23|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "in anguish in this flame",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|16:25|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in contrast the [[angel]]s take [[Rich man and Lazarus|Lazarus]] to "the [[bosom of Abraham]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|16:22|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; described as a state of comfort.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Luke|16:25–31|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Death and Hades are repeatedly associated in the [[Book of Revelation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Revelation|1:18|NIV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Rev|6:8|NIV}}, {{bibleverse||Rev|20:13–14|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "Hades" appears in Jesus' promise to Peter: "And I also say unto thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it",&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|16:18|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[Rejection of Jesus#Chorazin.2C Bethsaida and Capernaum|warning to Capernaum]]: "And thou, Capernaum, shalt thou be exalted unto heaven? thou shalt go down unto Hades."&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Matthew|11:23|NIV}}; {{bibleverse||Luke|10:15|NIV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The word "Hades" in Christian usage in English==
In English usage the word "Hades" first appears around 1600, as a transliteration of the Greek word "ᾅδης" in the line in the [[Apostles' Creed]], "He descended into hell", the place of waiting (the place of "the spirits in prison" {{bibleverse|1|Peter|3:19}}) into which Jesus is there affirmed to have gone after the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]]. Because this descent, known in Old and Middle English as the [[Harrowing of Hell]], needed to be distinguished from what had come to be more usually called "hell", i.e. the place or state of those finally damned, the word was transliterated and given a differentiated meaning.&lt;ref name="ODCC"/&gt;

This development whereby "hell" came to be used to mean only the "hell of the damned" affected also the Latin word "infernum" and the corresponding words in Latin-derived languages, as in the name "Inferno" given to the first part of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina Commedia]]''. Greek, on the other hand, has kept the original meaning of  "ᾅδης" (Hades) and uses the word "{{lang|grc|κόλασις}}" (''kólasis'' – literally, "punishment"; cf. {{bibleverse||Matthew|25:46}}, which speaks of "everlasting ''kolasis''") to refer to what nowadays is usually meant by "hell" in English.

==Church teachings==
{{main|Intermediate state}}

===The dead as conscious===
Most mainstream Christian denominations and churches believe in some form of conscious existence after the death of the body.

====Eastern Orthodox====
The teaching of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] is that, "after the soul leaves the body, it journeys to the [[Underworld|abode of the dead]] (Hades). There are exceptions, such as the [[Theotokos]], who was [[Assumption of Mary|borne by the angels directly into heaven]]. As for the rest, we must remain in this condition of waiting. Because some have a prevision of the glory to come and others foretaste their suffering, the state of waiting is called "[[Particular Judgment]]". [[Second Coming of Christ|When Christ returns]], the [[Resurrection of the Dead|soul rejoins its risen body]] to be judged by Him in the [[Last judgment]]. The 'good and faithful servant' will inherit [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]], the unfaithful with the unbeliever will spend eternity in hell. Their sins and their unbelief will torture them as fire."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Azkoul [http://www.ocf.org/OrthodoxPage/reading/ortho_cath.html ''What Are the Differences Between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Church of the East]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy]], the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]], hold that a final [[Universal Judgment]] will be pronounced on all human beings when soul and body are reunited in the [[resurrection of the dead]]. They also believe that the fate of those in the abode of the dead differs, even while awaiting resurrection: "The souls of the righteous are in light and rest, with a foretaste of eternal happiness; but the souls of the wicked are in a state the reverse of this."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pravoslavieto.com/docs/eng/Orthodox_Catechism_of_Philaret.htm The Longer Catechism of the Orthodox, Catholic, Eastern Church], 372&lt;/ref&gt;

====Roman Catholic====
The [[Latin]] word ''infernus'' or ''infernum'' ([[underworld]]) indicated the abode of the dead and so was used as the equivalent of the Greek word "ᾅδης" (hades). It appears in both the documents quoted above, and pointed more obviously than the Greek word to an existence beneath the earth. Later, the transliteration "hades" of the Greek word ceased to be used in Latin and "infernum" became the normal way of expressing the idea of Hades. Though "infernus" is usually translated into English as "hell", it did not have the narrow sense that the English word has now acquired. It continued to have the generic meaning of "abode of the dead". For the modern narrow sense the term "infernum damnatorum" (hell of the damned) was used, as in question 69, article 7 of the Supplement of the [[Summa Theologica]] of [[Thomas Aquinas]], which distinguishes five states or abodes of the dead: paradise, hell of the damned, [[Limbo#Limbo of Infants|limbo of children]], [[purgatory]], and [[Limbo#Limbo of the Patriarchs|limbo of the Fathers]]: "The soul separated from the body is in the state of receiving good or evil for its merits; so that after death it is either in the state of receiving its final reward, or in the state of being hindered from receiving it. If it is in the state of receiving its final retribution, this happens in two ways: either in the respect of good, and then it is paradise; or in respect of evil, and thus as regards actual sin it is hell, and as regards original sin it is the limbo of children. On the other hand, if it be in the state where it is hindered from receiving its final reward, this is either on account of a defect of the person, and thus we have purgatory where souls are detained from receiving their reward at once on account of the sins they have committed, or else it is on account of a defect of nature, and thus we have the limbo of the Fathers, where the Fathers were detained from obtaining glory on account of the guilt of human nature which could not yet be expiated."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/summa/5069.htm Question 69. Matters concerning the resurrection, and first of the place where souls are after death]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Anglican====
''The Anglican Catechist'' states that "there is an intermediate state between death and the [[Resurrection of the dead|resurrection]], in which the soul does not sleep in unconsciousness, but exists in happiness or misery till the resurrection, when it shall be reunited to the body and receive its final reward."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holden|first=George |title=The Anglican Catechist: Manual of Instruction Preparatory to Confirmation |year=1855|publisher=Joseph Masters|location=London |pages=40|quote=We are further taught by it that there is an intermediate state between death and the resurrection, in which the soul does not sleep in unconsciousness, but exists in happiness or misery till the resurrection, when it shall be reunited to the body and receive its final reward.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Henry Hobart]], an Anglican bishop, writes that "Hades, or the place of the dead, is represented as a spacious ''receptacle'' with gates, through which the dead enter."&lt;ref name="Hobart1825"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobart|first=John Henry|title=The State of the Departed |accessdate=10 April 2014|year=1825|publisher=T. and J.

====Methodist====
In the [[Methodist Church]], "''hades'' denotes the intermediate state of souls between death and the [[general resurrection]]," which is divided into [[Bosom of Abraham|Paradise]] (for the righteous) and [[Gehenna]] (for the wicked).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|quote=The country is called Hades.

====Reformed====
[[John Calvin]] held that the [[intermediate state]] is conscious and that the wicked suffer in hell.

===The dead as unconscious===
{{Main|Christian mortalism}}
Several groups of Christians believe in [[Christian mortalism]] or "[[soul sleep]]" and in [[general judgment]] ("[[Last Judgment]]") only. Denominations that see the dead in the [[intermediate state]] as not having consciousness include early Unitarians,  Christian [[Universalist]]s, [[Christadelphians]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]]&lt;ref&gt;Fundamental Belief # 26 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church states "The wages of sin is death. But God, who alone is immortal, will grant eternal life to His redeemed. Until that day death is an unconscious state for all people. When Christ, who is our life, appears, the resurrected righteous and the living righteous will be glorified and caught up to meet their Lord. The second resurrection, the resurrection of the unrighteous, will take place a thousand years later. (Rom. 6:23; 1 Tim. 6:15, 16; Eccl. 9:5, 6; Ps. 146:3, 4; John 11:11–14; Col. 3:4; 1 Cor. 15:51–54; 1 Thess. 4:13–17; John 5:28, 29; Rev. 20:1–10.)" &gt;[http://www.adventist.org/beliefs/fundamental/index.html Fundamental Belief # 26 of the Seventh-day Adventist Church]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].&lt;ref&gt;"The dead are conscious of nothing." [http://www.jw.org/en/bible-teachings/questions/when-you-die/ Bible Teachings-What Happens When You Die?, Official Website of Jehovah's Witnesses]&lt;/ref&gt; These groups also believe that Christ too was dead, unconscious and "asleep" during his time in the grave.

The views of Lutherans and Anglicans vary. [[Martin Luther]] himself appears inconsistent in his views though generally maintained that souls remained asleep until the resurrection whereupon hell awaited the condemned.
&lt;ref&gt;(LW 19:74&lt;/ref&gt; "I am not so sure what hell is like before the Day of Judgment. The notion that hell is a specific place, now tenanted by the souls of the damned, as artists portray it and the belly servers preach it, I consider of no value... However, on the Last Day this will assume a different aspect. Then hell will be a particular place and the abode of those consigned to it and the eternal wrath of God. But let this suffice. It is not very important whether or not one pictures hell as it is commonly portrayed and described. The fact remains that hell is far worse now—and will be even worse than it is now—than anyone is able to say, depict, or imagine."

The [[Church of England]] has a variety of views on the [[intermediate state|death state]]. Some, such as [[N. T. Wright]] have proposed a view of the grave which considers Hades to be a place where the dead sleep, and [[E. W. Bullinger]] argued for the cessation of the soul between death and resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleunderstanding.com/richmanandlazarus_contents.htm E.W. Bullinger on Luke 16:19–31]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christians believe in the soul's ''mortality'' ("[[Christian mortalism]]" or "[[soul sleep]]") and [[general judgment]] ("[[Last Judgment]]") only. This view is held by some [[Anglicans]] such as [[E. W. Bullinger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibleunderstanding.com/richmanandlazarus_contents.htm E.W. Bullinger on Luke 16:19–31]&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the mortality of the soul, and general judgment, for example Advent Christians, Conditionalists, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christadelphians]], and Christian [[Universalist]]s, argue that the story of the rich man and Lazarus is a parable using the framework of Jewish views of the [[Bosom of Abraham]], and is [[metaphor]]ical, and is not definitive teaching on the intermediate state for several reasons. After being emptied of the dead, Hades and death are thrown into the [[lake of fire]] in {{bibleref2|Revelation|20:13–14|NIV}}.

==Views of some early third-century writers==
[[Tertullian]] (c. 160 – c. 225), making an exception only for the [[martyr]]s, argued that the souls of the dead go down beneath the earth, and will go up to the sky ([[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]]) only at the [[End time|end of the world]]: "You must suppose Hades to be a subterranean region, and keep at arm's length those who are too proud to believe that the souls of the faithful deserve a place in the lower regions … How, indeed, shall the soul mount up to heaven, where Christ is already sitting at the Father's right hand, when as yet the archangel's trumpet has not been heard by the command of God, when as yet those whom the coming of the Lord is to find on the earth, have not been caught up into the air to meet Him at His coming, in company with the dead in Christ, who shall be the first to arise? … The sole key to unlock Paradise is your own life's blood.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0310.htm A Treatise on the Soul], chapter 55&lt;/ref&gt;

The variously titled fragment [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0520.htm "Against Plato" or "De Universo"], attributed to [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (c. 170 – c. 236), has the following: "And this is the passage regarding demons.  But now we must speak of Hades, in which the souls both of the righteous and the unrighteous are detained. Hades is a place in the created system, rude, a locality beneath the earth, in which the light of the world does not shine; and as the sun does not shine in this locality, there must necessarily be perpetual darkness there. This locality has been destined to be as it were a guard-house for souls, at which the angels are stationed as guards, distributing according to each one's deeds the temporary punishments for characters. And in this locality there is a certain place set apart by itself, a lake of unquenchable fire, into which we suppose no one has ever yet been cast; for it is prepared against the day determined by God, in which one sentence of righteous judgment shall be justly applied to all. And the unrighteous, and those who believed not God, who have honoured as God the vain works of the hands of men, idols fashioned, shall be sentenced to this endless punishment. But the righteous shall obtain the incorruptible and un-fading kingdom, who indeed are at present detained in Hades, but not in the same place with the unrighteous."

In his study, "Hades of Hippolytus or Tartarus of Tertullian? The Authorship of the Fragment ''De Universo''", C. E. Hill argues that the depiction of the [[intermediate state]] of the righteous expounded in this text is radically opposed to that found in the authentic works of Hippolytus and must have been written by Tertullian.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/1584133 ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Vol. 43, No. 2 (Jun., 1989), pp. 105–26]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Drawbridge in Nieuw-Amsterdam''''' is a watercolor created in November 1883 by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in [[Drente]], The [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vggallery.com/watercolours/p_1098.htm ''Drawbridge in Nieuw-Amsterdam.''] The Vincent van Gogh Gallery.

==Watercolor painting==
Van Gogh wrote to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], of the view outside his room in [[Nieuw-Amsterdam, Drenthe]]:  "I now have a reasonably large room where a stove has been placed, where there happens to be a small balcony. From which I can even see the [[heath]] with the huts. I also look out on a very curious drawbridge." Within the letter he drew a sketch of the bridge, which became the watercolor, ''Drawbridge in Nieuw-Amsterdam''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vangoghletters.org/vg/letters/let395/letter.html ''To Theo van Gogh.

The work was one of 148 watercolors made by Van Gogh, who said of working in that medium in 1881:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What a splendid thing watercolour is to express atmosphere and distance,&lt;br&gt;

'''ERSTE Foundation''' (in German '''DIE ERSTE österreichische Spar-Casse Privatstiftung''' or in short: '''ERSTE Stiftung''') is the biggest [[Austria]]n [[savings bank]] foundation. In 2003, it evolved from the Erste Oesterreichische Spar-Casse, the first Austrian savings bank founded in 1819. It is the main shareholder of [[Erste Group]]. ERSTE Foundation uses the profit from its [[shares]] to support the development of societies in Central and South Eastern Europe.

==Mission==
ERSTE Foundation is active in Central and South Eastern Europe. Its mission goes back to the savings banks idea of the 19th century. It supports social participation and [[civil society]] engagement; it aims to bring people together and disseminate knowledge of the recent history of a region that has been undergoing dramatic changes since [[Revolutions of 1989|1989]]. As an active foundation, it develops its own projects within the framework of three programs: [[Social Development]], [[Culture]], and [[Europe]].

===Programs===

====Social development====
The foundation encourages the development of fairer and stronger societies, where nobody is left behind. It has developed two complementary strategies of [[social intervention]]: the [[Social integration|integration]] of individuals and groups who live on the margins of society and research into [[social change]]. Its activities create fair prospects for people in difficult social conditions and situations of extreme need with regard to [[education]] and participation.

====Culture====
The culture program works on mostly [[transnationality|transnational]] projects, involving research activities that focus on the [[visual arts]] from the 1960s to the present day. Culture is seen as a driving force for a [[Democracy|democratic]] society and in its ability to forge links between diverse linguistic and geographical regions. Working with artistic strategies creates an experimental playing field for [[utopia]]s and for proposals beyond the feasibility of everyday politics as well as for exploring the possibilities of various artistic approaches. Therefore, the culture program promotes independent projects and those engaged in the cultural sector by providing them with resources and cross-border contacts that are not embedded within state institutions, also to stop the so-called [[brain drain]].

====Europe====
The Foundation promotes the process of [[European integration]] by providing a platform for exchanging ideas, knowledge and initiatives. [[Europeans]] are encouraged to live according to common values, to freely share ideas, to work together and to learn from one another. The projects focus on establishing a lively culture of dialogue. In an environment insisting on differences, people should be enabled to experience feelings of [[solidarity]], connection and [[cooperation]]. The projects anticipate the reality of a unified Europe and convey the potential of the common [[European Union|union]], in particular in those countries where, at present, EU programmes cannot yet be implemented. A focus lies on the work with young people, programs for journalists and debates on the future of Europe.

===Projects (examples)===
*'''[[Balkan Fellowship for Journalistic Excellence]]''' – Fellowship for journalists from 9 [[Balkan]] countries in cooperation with the [[Balkan Investigative Reporting Network]] and the [[Robert Bosch Stiftung]] to strengthen [[democracy]] and [[free speech]] through good quality journalism in [[News media|media]].
*'''[[ERSTE Foundation Fellowship for Social Research]]''' – 10 Eastern European scientists are granted each year a fellowship to research in depth a sociological, demographic, or socio-political topic within a European context.
*'''Gender Check. Femininity and Masculinity in the Art of Eastern Europe''' – the first exhibition, which dealt with the topic of [[gender roles]] and offered a representative overview of art from Eastern Europe since the 1960s. 25 curators from 24 countries worked for the show in the [[MUMOK|Museum of Modern Art Vienna]] that featured more than 400 works of more than 200 artists. It was also presented at [[Zachęta|Zacheta National Gallery]] in [[Warsaw]].
*'''[[Kontakt. The Art Collection of Erste Group and ERSTE Foundation]]''' - the art collection is a non-profit art association based in Vienna. Its purpose is the support and promotion of Central, East and Southeast European Art.
*'''[[KomenskýFond]]''' - Named after the Czech [[renaissance]] [[pedagogue]] [[Johann Comenius|Jan Komenský]] the fund is a cooperation of [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas Austria]] and ERSTE Foundation, established in 9 countries to help alleviate [[poverty]] through [[education]] especially for children in [[Romani people|Romani]] communities.
*'''PATTERNS Lectures''' - This series of lectures supports the development of new university courses in Central and South Eastern Europe in the fields of [[art history]], [[cultural theory]], and [[cultural studies]]. It supports lecturers’ international study visits and encourages international academic exchange by offering the possibility of guest lectures.
*'''[[tranzit.org]]''' – the independent tranzit network operates in [[Austria]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]] and the [[Slovak Republic]]. Each tranzit local ‘unit’ has its unique and autonomous way of working, deals with several artistic settings and manifests itself in lectures, performances, discussions, publications, exhibitions, and researches. In 2010, the tranzit team was one of the three curatorial teams for the European [[wikt:biennial|art biennial]] [[Manifesta]] 8 in [[Murcia]], [[Spain]].

===Social banking and financial inclusion===
Being a savings bank foundation, ERSTE Foundation is committed to the social savings bank idea of the 19th century. Therefore, [[social banking]] and [[financial inclusion]] are key issues within the Program Social Development. The best known projects in this field are: 
*'''Die Zweite Sparkasse''' (The Second Savings Bank) - A bank for the unbankable
*'''good.bee''' - the [[micro finance]] and [[social entrepreneurship]] institute of Erste Group and ERSTE Foundation
*'''The Social Business Tour 2010''' - a roadshow with workshops to promote [[social business]] in Eastern Europe with [[Muhammad Yunus]]

===Awards===

====ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration====
Every two years, starting in 2007, the [[ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration]] is awarded to projects working successfully for the [[social integration]] of people in their communities. During an [[open call]], 30 winners are selected among over 1000 applicants from 12 countries (2011) and will receive a total price money of EUR 610,000. Additionally, the publicly honoured NGOs get two years for free [[public relations]] (PR) support for their projects and access to an international network of peers. Award ceremonies have been held so far in [[Ljubljana]] (2007), [[Bucharest]] (2009), and [[Prague]] (2011).

====Igor Zabel Award for Culture and Theory====
ERSTE Foundation established the biennial [[Igor Zabel Award for Culture and Theory]] in 2008. It supports the work of [[art historian]]s and [[Art theory|theorists]] in CEE and highlights the notion of arts and culture, encouraging the production of cultural knowledge and exchange between ‘East’ and ‘West’. The award is named after the Slovenian author, art critic and [[curator]] [[Igor Zabel]] (1958–2005), the senior curator of [[Ljubljana|Ljubljana's]] [[Moderna Galerija]]. He established cultural links between Eastern and Western Europe.

*[[European Fund for the Balkans]] (EFB)
*[[Forum for Roma Inclusion]]
*[[Grant Makers East Forum]]
*[[Roma Education Fund]] (REF)
*[[Networking European Citizenship Education]] (NECE)

==History==
The origins of the foundation go back to the 19th century. The Erste österreichische Spar-Casse was founded in 1819.&lt;ref&gt;C. Rapp, N. Rapp-Wimberger: Arbeite, Sammle, Vermehre. Von der ersten Oesterreichischen Spar-Casse zur Erste Bank. Christian Brandstätter Verlag, Vienna 2005, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of the amendment to the Austrian Savings Bank Act, Erste österreichische Spar-Casse was split into an operational [[bank]] ([[Erste Group|Erste Bank AG]]) and a [[holding company]] (DIE ERSTE österreichische Spar-Casse Anteilsverwaltungssparkasse, in short: AVS) in 1993. In 1997 Erste Bank, which had merged with GiroCredit Bank AG der Sparkassen, [[went public]], making AVS the main shareholder of the company, which has been listed on the Vienna Stock Exchange ever since. In 2003 AVS was formally transformed into DIE ERSTE österreichische Spar-Casse Privatstiftung, in short: ERSTE Stiftung (ERSTE Foundation), which began its operations two years later.

The first major projects included the Zweite Wiener Vereins-Sparcasse, in short: Zweite Sparkasse, founded in 2006, and the Academy for Central European Schools (aces) network, established in the same year. 2007 saw the presentation of the first ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration in [[Ljubljana]] and the launch of the first call of the Balkan Fellowship for Journalistic Excellence. The Igor Zabel Award for Culture and Theory and the foundation of good.bee followed in 2008. In 2009 [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] and [[3sat]] first broadcast the TV documentary series "Balkan Express (Return to Europe)" and the ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration went into its second round, with the ceremony being held in [[Bucharest]]. The largest culture project to date – the exhibition Gender Check – opened at MUMOK Vienna in 2010. In the same year, the Social Business Tour 2010 with [[Muhammad Yunus]] toured through six Eastern European countries with the aim of introducing the concept of social business as a form of sustainable economic activity in [[Vienna]], [[Bratislava]], [[Budapest]], [[Prague]], Bucharest and [[Belgrade]]. That same year the Igor Zabel Award for Culture and Theory was awarded to Polish art historian Piotr Piotrowski in [[Barcelona]]. In 2011 the ERSTE Foundation Award for Social Integration – then in its third round – was presented in Prague to 34 projects from 12 countries.

==Legal status==
ERSTE Foundation is a savings bank private foundation as defined by the Austrian Savings Bank Act.

===Boards===
The bodies of the foundation include the [[Managing board|Managing Board]], the [[Supervisory Board]] and the Association. The private Savings Bank Association, established in 1819 and comprising more than 100 members, elects the members of the Supervisory Board and designates its president.

'''''Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad''''' is a book written by [[William Craig (author)|William Craig]] and published in 1973 by [[Reader's Digest Press]] and in 1974 by [[Penguin Publishing]]. The 2001 film ''[[Enemy at the Gates]]'' utilized the book's title and used it as one of its sources, but was not a direct adaptation of the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.epilog.de/Film/Dr_Dz/Texte/Duell_Enemy_at_the_Gates_USA_D_2001_Interview.htm| website=Epilog.de| title=Interview with Jean-Jacques Annaud, referenced by Constantin Film| language=German| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818113711/http://www.epilog.de/Film/Dr_Dz/Texte/Duell_Enemy_at_the_Gates_USA_D_2001_Interview.htm| archivedate=2007-08-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2001-03-16/features/0103160144_1_vassili-zaitsev-danilov-jude-law|title=`Enemy at the Gates' is right on target|website=Baltimore Sun|access-date=2016-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
The ''[[Slavic Review]]'' panned ''Enemy at the Gates'', calling it "rambling and exaggerated" and negatively comparing Craig to author [[Paul Carell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Parrish|first=Michael|date=1974-01-01|title=Review of Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad|jstor=2495819|journal=Slavic Review|volume=33|issue=2|pages=363–364|doi=10.2307/2495819}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' was more favorable and drew favorable comparisons to [[Cornelius Ryan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ambrose|first1=Stephen E.|title=So much for so little|work=The Washington Post|date=04/08/1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{mergeto|Shared universe|date=May 2018}}
The term '''expanded universe''', sometimes called an '''extended universe''', is generally used to denote the "extension" of a [[media franchise]] (like a television program or a series of feature films) with other media, generally comics and original novels. This typically involves new stories for existing characters already developed within the franchise, but in some cases entirely new characters and complex mythology are developed. This is not necessarily the same as an adaptation, which is a retelling of the same story that may or may not adhere to accepted [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Nearly every media franchise with a committed fan base has some form of expanded universe.

==Examples==
Two prominent examples of media franchises with an expanded universe are ''[[Star Wars]]''&lt;ref name="Knight2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gladys L. Knight|title=Female Action Heroes: A Guide to Women in Comics, Video Games, Film, and Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0PKSFHwhTGYC&amp;pg=PA240|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-37612-2|pages=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Star Trek]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Expanded Universe: ''Star Trek''|publisher=Empire|accessdate=23 November 2013|url=http://www.empireonline.com/features/star-trek-expanded-universe}}&lt;/ref&gt; which both have a wide range of original novels, comics, video games, and other media that add to the mythology of their fictional universe in different ways. In both cases, entirely new characters and situations have been developed that exist only within the expanded universe media.&lt;ref name="SW Legends"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' Turns a New Page |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THR Legends"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars Expanded Universe'' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canonicity==
Although there are some exceptions, expanded universe works are generally accepted as [[Canon (fiction)|canon]], or part of the "official" storyline continuity. Otherwise, they are considered [[Apocrypha (fiction)|apocrypha]]. In some cases, characters created for an expanded universe are later featured in the primary works associated with that franchise, as in the cases of [[Aayla Secura]] and [[Grand Admiral Thrawn]] in the ''Star Wars'' franchise.&lt;ref name="Filoni CB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/starwars/2017/02/20/star-wars-lucasfilm-legends-expanded-universe-george-lucas/|title=''Star Wars'': Dave Filoni Explains George Lucas and Lucasfilm's Relationship with ''Legends''|publisher=Comicbook.com|first=Lucas|last=Siegel|date=February 20, 2017|accessdate=February 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UT Rebels"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2016/07/16/thrawn-star-wars-rebels-celebration/87180842/ |title=Thrawn to make grand appearance in ''Star Wars Rebels'' |work=[[USA Today]] |first=Brian |last=Truitt |date=July 16, 2016 |accessdate=July 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When all expanded universe works (films, novels, comic books, video games, role-playing games, etc.) are considered canonical, then the expanded universe is an "imaginary entertainment environment."&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, Daniel.

'''''Flags of Our Fathers''''' (2000) is a ''[[New York Times]]'' bestselling book by [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]] with [[Ron Powers]] about the six [[United States Marines]] who would eventually be made famous by [[Joe Rosenthal]]'s lauded photograph of the [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima|flag raising at Iwo Jima]], one of the costliest and most horrifying battles of [[World War II]]'s [[Pacific Ocean theater of World War II|Pacific Theater]].  The flag raisers were [[Harold Schultz]],  [[Rene Gagnon]], [[Ira Hayes]], [[Mike Strank]], [[Harlon Block]], and [[Franklin Sousley]]; the latter three men died later in the battle.  Strank was a [[Sergeant]] who refused several promotions during the battle in order to "Bring his boys back to their mothers."  Block was a [[Corporal]] who reported to Strank, and the rest were [[Private (rank)|Privates]] in the Marines, except for [[John Bradley (United States Navy)|John Bradley]], a Navy Corpsman who administered first aid to Easy [[Company (military unit)|Company]] of 2nd [[Battalion]], [[28th Marines]], [[5th Marine Division]], the company to which all the flag raisers were assigned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/b/bradley-flags.html |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|author=James Bradley|author2=Ron Powers|title=Flags of Our Fathers|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The book, published in May 2000 by [[Bantam Books]], a division of [[Random House]], spent 46 weeks on the ''[[New York Times]]'' nonfiction bestseller list, spending six weeks at number one. Shortly after the book's publication, Steven Spielberg acquired the option on the film rights for [[DreamWorks Pictures]].

The book follows the lives of the six flag-raisers through their early lives of innocence, military training, fierce combat and afterward, when they were sent on tours to raise money for [[war bond]]s.

The film adaptation ''[[Flags of Our Fathers (film)|Flags of Our Fathers]]'', which opened in the U.S. on October 20, 2006, was directed by [[Clint Eastwood]] and produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], with a screenplay written by [[William Broyles, Jr.]] and [[Paul Haggis]].

A '''floating timeline''' (also known as a '''sliding timescale''') is a device used in [[fiction]], particularly in [[comics]] and [[animation]], to explain why characters [[Ageless|age little or not at all over a period of time]] — despite real-world markers like notable events, people and technology appearing in the works and correlating with the real world. A floating timeline is a subtle form of [[retroactive continuity]]. This is seen most clearly in the case of comic book characters who debuted as teens in the 1940s or the 1960s but who are still relatively young in current comics. Events from the characters' pasts are alluded to, but they are changed from having taken place years ago to having taken place more recently.

==Overview==
For an example taken from television animation, in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', episode "[[I Married Marge]]", which was broadcast in 1991, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] are shown in flashback to have conceived their son [[Bart Simpsons|Bart]] in 1980, after watching ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' in the cinema. In an episode that was broadcast in 2008, "[[That '90s Show]]", however, another flashback shows Homer and Marge in an earlier stage of their relationship, but sets those scenes in the mid- to late- 1990s. In both sets of present-day scenes, the characters are shown to be the same age—for example, Bart is still 10 years old in 1991 and 2008.

For comic book examples, any dates given within the comic are not relative to the publishing date of the comic (i.e. "10 years ago" means ten years before the reader read the story). This device enables publishing companies to continue to use their characters for as long as they wish without changing them significantly.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

A floating timeline is usually abstracted from that of actual historical events, but may contain subtle references to the real world timelines. There may also be attempts made to maintain certain characters' historic timelines if it is felt to be essential to the character's personality, while allowing the rest of the world's timelines to continue to develop. For example, in the 2000s comic book miniseries ''[[The Punisher (2000 series)|The Punisher]]'' and [[The Punisher (2001 series)|its subsequent continuation]], the title character is shown to be a [[Vietnam War]] veteran, just as he was in his earliest appearances in the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] comics of the 1970s. However, the stories place him in contemporary New York, where he meets fellow Marvel characters such as [[Spider-Man]], who is barely much older than he was when introduced in 1962.{{fact|date=September 2015}} 

An example taken from novels is the case of mystery writer [[Rex Stout]], who created a floating timeline for master detective [[Nero Wolfe]] and other principal characters in the corpus, while the stories take place contemporaneously with their writing and depict a changing landscape and society. Nero Wolfe's age is 56. "Those stories have ignored time for thirty-nine years," Stout told his authorized biographer John McAleer. "Any reader who can't or won't do the same should skip them. I didn't age the characters because I didn't want to. That would have made it cumbersome and would seem to have centered attention on the characters rather than the stories."&lt;ref&gt;McAleer, John, ''Rex Stout: A Biography'' (1977, Little, Brown and Company; {{ISBN|0-316-55340-9}}), p. 383; and McAleer, John, ''Royal Decree'' (1983, Pontes Press, Ashton, Maryland), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; In the early novels, Wolfe dated himself somewhat by discussing his life before [[World War I]] and his combat service in that war, but in later stories he was less explicit about his past.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

[[File:Patrick Shellenberger in a production photograph on the set of "Dim Sum, A little Bit of Heart".jpg|thumb|Gaffer Patrick Shellenberger in a production photograph on the set of ''[[Dim Sum: A Little Bit of Heart]]'']]
A '''gaffer''' in the [[motion picture industry]] and on a [[television crew]] is the head [[electrician]], responsible for the execution (and sometimes the design) of the [[lighting]] plan for a production. The term gaffer originally related to the moving of overhead equipment to control lighting levels using a [[wiktionary:gaff|gaff]].   The gaffer's assistant is the [[best boy]].&lt;ref name="Taub153"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gaffers, Grips, and Best Boys |last=Taub |first=Eric |year=1994 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |location=New York |isbn=0-312-11276-9 |page=153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the gaffer is credited as [[Lighting technician|Chief Lighting Technician]] (CLT).

The term has been used for the chief electrician in films since the 1930s.  The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] has a citation from 1936;&lt;ref name=OED&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] accessed 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; a 1929 book on motion picture production also uses the term.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Eunice McCarthy, The Hands of Hollywood, 1929: 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gaffer is responsible for managing lighting, including associated resources such as labour, lighting instruments and electrical equipment under the direction of the [[Director of Photography]] (the DP or DOP) or, in television, the Lighting Director (LD).

The DP/LD is responsible for the overall lighting design, but delegates the implementation of the design to the gaffer and the [[key grip]]. The key grip is the head [[Grip (job)|grip]], in charge of the labour and non-electrical equipment used to support and modify the lighting. Grip equipment includes stands, [[Flag (lighting)|flags]] and [[Gobo (lighting)|gobos]]. The gaffer will usually have an assistant called a [[best boy]] and, depending on the size of the job, crew members who are called "set lighting technicians" or "[[lighting technician|electricians]]", although not all of them are trained as [[electrician]]s in the usual sense of the term.

Although  [[gaffer tape]] is used within the film/TV Industry as a strong cloth-backed adhesive tape, many other types of tape are also used, such as paper tape, [[pressure-sensitive tape]] (A.K.A. snot tape), [[electrical tape]], J-LAR, and cloth tape. Gaffer tape is typically utilized by set lighting technicians under the supervision of, and not directly by, a gaffer.

[[File:Grille_du_Coq_detail.jpg|thumb|Gallic rooster on the garden gate of the [[Palais de l'Elysée]] in Paris, the official residence of the [[President of the French Republic]].]]

The '''Gallic rooster''' ({{lang-fr|le coq gaulois}}, ''the Gallic cock'') is an unofficial [[national symbol]] of [[France]] as a nation, as opposed to [[Marianne]] representing France as a State, and its values: [[French Republic|the Republic]]. The [[rooster]] is also the symbol of the [[Wallonia]] region and the [[French Community of Belgium]].

==France==
[[File:Mémorial des soldats et marins de la Charente-Inférieure (16).JPG|thumb|left|Gallic rooster on top of a [[Monuments aux Morts|war memorial]] in [[La Rochelle]]]]
During the times of Ancient Rome, [[Suetonius]], in [[The Twelve Caesars]], noticed that, in [[Latin language|Latin]], rooster (''gallus'') and [[Gauls]] (''Gallus'') were [[homonym]]s.&lt;ref name="Drapeau"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Collignon|first1=Alain|title=Drapeau wallon|url=http://www.wallonie-en-ligne.net/Encyclopedie/Thematiques/Notices/DrapeauW.htm|publisher=Institut Destrée [The Destree Institute]|accessdate=13 March 2018|location=[[Wallonia]]|language=French|trans-title=Walloon flag|date=6 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the association of the Gallic rooster as a national symbol is [[apocrypha]]l, as the rooster was neither regarded as a national personification nor as a sacred animal by the [[Gauls]] in their mythology and because there was no "Gallic nation" at the time, but a loose confederation of Gallic nations instead. But a closer review within that religious scheme indicates that "[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]" was often portrayed with the [[rooster|cockerel]],{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} a sacred animal among the [[Continental Celts]].&lt;ref name="Ellis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Peter Berresford|authorlink1=Peter Berresford Ellis|title=Dictionary of Celtic Mythology|date=23 June 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0195089615}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julius Caesar]] in ''[[De Bello Gallico]]'' identified some gods worshipped in [[Gaul]] by using the names of their nearest [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god rather than their Gaulish name, with Caesar saying "[[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]]" was the god most revered in Gaul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource|plaintitle=[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]&lt;!-- |language=Latin --&gt;|trans_title=Commentaries on the Gallic War|wslink=Commentaries on the Gallic War/Book 6#17|last=Caesar|first=Julius|authorlink=Julius Caesar|others=Translated from Latin by William Alexander McDevitte and W. S. Bohn (1869)|year=53 BC|volume=Book 6|chapter=Chapter 17|publisher=|location=|page=|pages=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish god [[Lugh|Lug]] identified as ''[[samildánach]]'' led to the widespread identification of Caesar's [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] as [[Lugus]]{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and thus also to the sacred cockerel, the Gallic rooster, as an emblem of France.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Its association with France dates back from the [[Middle Age]] and is due to the play on words in [[Latin language|Latin]] between ''Gallus'', meaning an inhabitant of [[Gaul]], and ''gallus'', meaning [[rooster]], or cockerel. Its use, by the enemies of France, dates to this period, originally a [[pun]] to make fun of the French,&lt;ref name="Drapeau"/&gt; the association between the rooster and the Gauls/French was developed by the kings of France for the strong Christian symbol that the rooster represents: prior to being arrested, Jesus predicted that Peter would deny him three times before the rooster crowed on the following morning. At the rooster's crowing, Peter remembered Jesus's words. Its crowing at the dawning of each new morning made it a symbol of the daily victory of light over darkness and the triumph of good over evil. It is also an emblem of the Christian's attitude of watchfulness and readiness for the sudden return of Christ, the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment of humankind. That is why, during the [[Renaissance]], the rooster became a symbol of France as a Catholic state and became a popular Christian image on [[weather vane]]s, also known as weathercocks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Liomer,_Somme,_France.JPG|thumbnail|Gallic rooster atop a [[World War I]] memorial, [[Liomer]] ([[Somme (department)|Somme]]).]] 
[[File:Logo XV de france.JPG|thumbnail|left|The jersey of the [[France national rugby union team|French national rugby team]], with the traditional Gallic rooster symbol]]

The popularity of the Gallic rooster as a national personification faded away until its resurgence during the [[French Revolution]] (1789). The republican [[historiography]] completely modified the traditional perception of the origins of France. Until then, the royal historiography dated the origins of France back to the baptism of [[Clovis I]] in 496, the "first Christian king of France". The republicans rejected this royalist and Christian origin of the country and trace the origins of France back to the ancient Gaul. Although purely apocryphal, the rooster became the personification of the early inhabitants of France, the Gauls.

The Gallic rooster, colloquially named ''Chanteclair'', had been a national emblem ever since, especially during the [[Third French Republic|Third Republic]]. The rooster was featured on the reverse of French 20-franc gold pieces from 1899 to 1914. After [[World War I]] it was depicted on countless [[war memorials]].

Today, it is often used as a national [[mascot]], particularly in sporting events such as [[Association football|football]] (soccer) and [[rugby football|rugby]]. The [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], hosted by France, adopted a rooster named [[Footix]] as [[mascot]]. The [[France national rugby league team]] are known as the ''Chanteclairs'' referring to the cockerel's song.

The popularity of the symbol extends into business. ''[[Le Coq Sportif]]'' ("The athletic rooster"), is a French manufacturer of sports equipment using a stylized rooster and the colors of the [[French tricolour]] as its logo. Moreover, it is the logo of [[Pathé]], a French-born, now international company of film production and distribution.

Another heraldic animal officially used by the French nation was the [[French Imperial Eagle]], symbol of the [[First French Empire|First]] and [[Second French Empire]] under [[Napoleon I]] and [[Napoleon III]].

==Wallonia==
[[File:Flag of Wallonia.svg|thumbnail|The [[Flag of Wallonia|Walloon rooster]].]]

In 1913, the Gallic rooster was adopted as the symbol of [[Walloon movement]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} It represents a "[[Fighting cocks|bold rooster]]" (''coq hardi''), raising its claws, instead of the "crowing rooster" that is traditionally depicted in France. This symbol, also known as the Walloon rooster, was officially adopted as the symbol of [[Wallonia]] (in 1998) and the [[French Community of Belgium]] (in 1991).

==Cocorico==
In France and Wallonia, the [[French language|French]] [[onomatopoeia]] for the rooster [[Rooster#Crowing|crowing sound]], "cocorico" (''cock-a-doodle-doo''), is sometimes used to express national pride.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The painting is important as it is a contemporary view showing all three powers involved during the 1750s in the [[French and Indian War]]&lt;ref name=Warforempire/&gt; (which could be called more comprehensively "the [[United Kingdom|British]], [[France|French]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indian]] War"&lt;ref name=achenbach&gt;{{Cite news | author=Joel Achenbach | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/gog/exhibits/clash-of-empires-the-british-french-and-indian-war-1754-1763,1093313/critic-review.html#reviewNum1 | title=Clash of Empires: The British, French and Indian War, 1754-1763 | newspaper=The Washington Post | page=C01 | date=2006-12-16 | accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

West was an early American painter. He claimed to have been first taught how to make paint by a Native American childhood friend who demonstrated how paint could be made by mixing clay with [[Bear's grease|bear grease]].&lt;ref name=fuller&gt;[http://www.wgbh.org/articles/Music-and-Art--West-and-Antes-1679 Music and Art], Catherine Fuller, WGBH, retrieved 28 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt; This painting has fine detail on the native figure, whose plucked scalp and tattoos are shown in more detail than the Europeans' uniforms. West is known to have had a collection of North American artefacts which he used in his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Pratt | first=Stephanie | title=American Indians in British art, 1700-1840 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2QEI_GiIsUC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=benjamin+west+native+american+bear&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BJQhTsrHB4-38QOYv5mtAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=general%20johnson&amp;f=false | accessdate=2011-08-18 | year=2005 | publisher=Univ of Oklahoma Pr | isbn=978-0-8061-3657-8 | pages=85, 198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benjamin West probably began this painting soon after his arrival in London, in 1763, when West returned from [[Italy]], where he spent three years. Following ''The Indian Family'', a painting of about 1761, this one demonstrates the same willingness to show "the proper dress and accoutrement".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Pratt | first=Stephanie | title=American Indians in British art, 1700-1840 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2QEI_GiIsUC&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=General+Johnson+saving+a+Wounded+French+Officer+from+the+Tomahawk+of+a+North+American+Indian&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=ZhIbTsSIOYb1-gbyo-XXBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=General%20Johnson%20saving%20a%20Wounded%20French%20Officer%20from%20the%20Tomahawk%20of%20a%20North%20American%20Indian&amp;f=false | accessdate=2011-08-18 | year=2005 | publisher=Univ of Oklahoma Pr | isbn=978-0-8061-3657-8 | pages=75–76, 240}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus it provides us with one of two known contemporary pictures of the British [[Light infantry|Light Infantrymen]] for the French and Indian War period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://schrothscompany.com/document_folder/46th_Uniforms.pdf | title=Uniforms of the 46th Regiment of Foot | page=2 | format=PDF | publisher=Schroth's New York Company | accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in the Italian painting, accuracy and authenticity were intended to give a generic representation of the Indian life, the new one employed them to make a report of a recent historical event.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

Although the subject matter and some "physical and symbolic details" could be found more closely corresponding to the [[Battle of Fort Niagara]] (1759),&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Pouchot, Michael Cardy (translation) and Brian Leigh Dunnigan (edition and notes), ''Memoirs on the Late War in North America Between France &amp; England'' ({{fr icon}} ''Mémoires sur la dernière guerre de l'Amérique septentrionale entre la France et l'Angleterre'', Switzerland, Yverdon, 1781), Youngstown (N.Y.), Old Fort Niagara Association, 1994, 568 p.

After having repulsed an attack against their camp, the British and their auxiliaries took over. Dieskau, wounded three times, had his life saved by Johnson, who protected him from the Mohawks wanting revenge for their killed kinsmen.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; He actually survived and was taken as a prisoner to [[New York City|New York]], then to London, and then to [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] for treatment of a still unhealed wound. At the end of the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1763, he was repatriated to France, where he died in 1767.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DCB |first=James R. |last=Turnbull |volume=3 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/dieskau_jean_armand_3E.html |title=Dieskau, Jean-Armand, baron de Dieskau |accessdate=2011-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West returned to the American war in his ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'', exhibited in 1771, a much larger work that made his reputation, though causing controversy through its use of contemporary costume.

== Historical context ==
[[File:Benjamin West 005.jpg|thumb|300px|left|West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]],'' 1770]]
By showing Johnson restraining the aggressive actions of an auxiliary, the painting promotes "civilized" standards of honor and laws of war, as opposed to the ferocity of "savages". It refers to the concerns and debates that the employment of Indian allies aroused among [[Europe]]ans, throughout the conflicts in [[North America]].&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt; Johnson's act of humanity contrasts against Johnson's reputation which has included him being described as a "White Savage" for his general attitude.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fintan O'Toole|O'Toole, Fintan]]. ''White Savage: William Johnson and the Invention of America''. New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2005. {{ISBN|0-374-28128-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the French and Indian War, young [[George Washington]] is said to have let Indian chief Tanaghrisson seal their fresh alliance by smashing the skull of [[Joseph Coulon de Jumonville]], a wounded French officer they just took as prisoner, then washing his hands in the man's brain. The [[Battle of Jumonville Glen|Jumonville affair]] caused a scandal in Europe, where it accelerated the expansion of the Seven Years' War.&lt;ref name=achenbach/&gt;

The same questions persisted during the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence of the United States]]. In 1777, both Houses of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] debated over the use of Indian auxiliaries. [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]]'s speech in the [[House of Lords]] (November 20), denouncing acts of violence perpetrated against "innocents" and the practice of [[cannibalism]], is indicative of reluctances that appear to have been widely shared.&lt;ref name=pratt/&gt;

'''''Gongbi''''' ({{Zh|t=工筆|s=工笔|p=gōng bǐ|w=kung-pi}}) is a careful [[Realism (arts)|realist]] technique in [[Chinese painting]], the opposite of the interpretive and freely expressive ''[[Xieyi (painting)|xieyi]]'' (寫意 'sketching thoughts') style.

The name is from the Chinese ''gong jin'' meaning 'tidy' (meticulous brush craftsmanship). The ''gongbi'' technique uses highly detailed brushstrokes that delimits details very precisely and without independent or expressive variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gongbi Painting - Chinese Traditional Painting with Meticulous Detail - China culture  Qiu Ying, Shen Quan|url = http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/62Arts2192.html|website = arts.cultural-china.com|access-date = 2016-02-04|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090409090447/http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/62Arts2192.html|archivedate = 2009-04-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often highly colored and usually depicts figural or narrative subjects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = gongbi {{!}} Chinese painting|url = http://www.britannica.com/art/gongbi|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the better known Gongbi works is the Song Dynasty Scroll, 17 feet long and includes intricate details that most don’t pick up. It is one of many popular tourist attractions in China today, as it is updated regularly to try and show what modern China looks like compared to when it was created during the Song Dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Two Versions of the Scroll |url=http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/songdynasty-module/intro-two-versions.html |website=The Song Dynasty in China: China in 1000 CE |publisher=Columbia University |accessdate=17 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term related to ''gongbi'', ''jiehua'' (or "boundary painting"), refers to the accurate depiction of [[architectural]] forms aided by the ruler.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
The ''gongbi'' style had its beginnings approximately 2000 years ago during the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD) when Han's political stability and its prosperity favored the advancement of the arts. These paintings peaked out between the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song dynasty|Song]] dynasties (7th to 13th centuries) when these refined paintings were endorsed and collected by the royal families of China. To perfect this style the ''gongbi'' artists must totally commit themselves to these techniques. Only the wealthy could afford such artists. This style of art was accomplished in secret in royal palaces and private homes. Gongbi is one of the oldest Chinese painting techniques that feature narratives or high authority figures in them.

==Tools==
When using brushes to paint gongbi,  there are specific types for contouring and colouring. There are four types of brushes for [[contour drawing|contouring]]; Hong Mao (red hairs), are used to draw thick strokes mainly for [[landscape]] and background visuals. Yi Wen is used for longer lines to paint clothing, for example. Ye Jing brushes are used to contour flowers and bedsheets. Xie Zhua is the finest contour brush used to paint strokes of dragonflies and specific detail in the painting. There are three sizes of brushes used to colour the surface of the painting: Da Bai Yun (large white cloud), Zhong Bai Yun (average white cloud) and Xiao Bai Yun (small white cloud). Rough drafts are usually drawn on [[rice paper]]. If there is only one draft, a special type of paper called [[Xuan paper]] is used. The soft paper is able to absorb water well, best used for [[Chinese painting]] and [[calligraphy]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://www.chine-culture.com/en/chinese-painting/chinese-painting-gongbi.php; retrieved on 2014-04-3&lt;/ref&gt; Silk can also be used, which is sized as well.

==Process of the craft==
''Gongbi'' requires drawing with fine lines first to represent the exaggerated likenesses of the objects, and then adds washes of ink and color layer by layer, so as to approach the perfection of exquisiteness and fine art. The practice of Gongbi is specifically on rice paper when sketching out the design and layout of the drawing. Typically, pencil is used before beginning the second draft with the tipped brushes. The variation and detail in strokes are important especially when layering each wash of ink on top of each other. There are upward and downward strokes used that emphasize detailed pictures such as facial features and insects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After hundreds of years, a technique was developed for all gongbi artists as a system. Lines are used first to contour the figure and determine the fine outlines of the painting. Modest colors are added to the painting that add onto a sense of nature; flamboyant colors are used when the content of the painting has accentuated lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaculture.org/classics/2012-02/10/content_429449_2.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407095336/http://www.chinaculture.org/classics/2012-02/10/content_429449_2.htm |archivedate=2014-04-07 |df= }} retrieved on 2014-04-3&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gorm Henrik Rasmussen''' (born 1955) is a Danish poet who wrote the first biography about the guitarist and singer-songwriter [[Nick Drake]], ''Pink Moon'' (1986). The book is based upon interviews Gorm Henrik Rasmussen made with Nick Drake's parents, Rodney and [[Molly Drake]], in their home in [[Tanworth-in-Arden]], [[Warwickshire]], England, in 1979 and 1980. ''[http://rocket88books.com/2012/01/27/pink-moon/ Pink Moon]'' was re-written and translated into English in 2009. In 2012, it became the launch title for [http://rocket88books.com/ Rocket 88], a new music book imprint of [http://www.essentialworks.co.uk/ Essential Works]. A Spanish version has also appeared in 2012.

Gorm Henrik Rasmussen is known in Denmark for a number of books about eccentrics and strange places in the [[northern part of Jutland]] where he was born and raised. He has received several literary awards from [[The Danish Arts Foundation]] and The Danish Arts Council.

The '''Ica stones''' are a collection of [[andesite]] stones found in [[Ica Province]], [[Peru]] that bear a variety of diagrams. Some of them supposedly have depictions of [[dinosaur]]s, and what is alleged to be advanced [[technology]]. These are recognised as modern curiosities or [[hoax]]es.

From the 1960s Javier Cabrera Darquea collected and popularized the stones, obtaining many of them from a farmer named Basilio Uschuya. Uschuya, after claiming them to be real ancient artifacts, admitted to creating the carvings he had sold and said he produced a [[patina]] by baking the stone in cow dung.

==Description==
The stones are composed of [[andesite]]. They vary in size from 3x2.5x1.5&amp;nbsp;cm to 40&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; As a result of weathering, they have developed a thin [[patina]]. It consists of a [[weathering rind]] in which weathering has turned some of the [[feldspar]] into [[clay]], resulting in a softer material, rated 3 to 4 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]], which can be scratched.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt;

They are shallowly [[engraving|engraved]] with a variety of images, some directly incised, others by removing the background, leaving the image in [[relief]]. The images vary from simple pictures on one side of a pebble, up to designs of great complexity. Some of the designs are in styles which can be recognized as belonging to the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]], [[Nazca culture|Nazca]], [[Tiwanaku]], or [[Inca]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt;

Some of the images are of flowers, fish, or living animals of various sorts.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; Others appear to depict scenes&lt;ref name = Skepdic&gt;{{cite book |author=Carroll, Robert T. |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |title=[[The Skeptic's Dictionary]]: a collection of strange beliefs, amusing deceptions, and dangerous delusions |publisher=Wiley |location=New York |year=2003 |pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC&amp;pg=PA169#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 169–71]|isbn=0-471-27242-6 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}, also online at [http://www.skepdic.com/icastones.html skepdic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortean&gt;{{cite journal |last=Coppens |first=P |title=Jurassic library - The Ica Stones |journal=[[Fortean Times]] |date=October 2001 |url=http://www.forteantimes.com/features/articles/259/jurassic_library_the_ica_stones.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827173630/http://forteantimes.com/features/articles/259/jurassic_library_the_ica_stones.html |archivedate=2008-08-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be anachronistic in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] art, such as knowledge of dinosaurs, advanced medical works and maps.&lt;ref name="Carroll2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carroll|first=Robert|title=The Skeptic's Dictionary: A Collection of Strange Beliefs, Amusing Deceptions, and Dangerous Delusions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6FPqDFx40vYC|accessdate=8 December 2013|date=2011-01-11|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118045633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Archaeological remains show evidence of Peruvian cultures going back for several thousand years. At some later stages, the whole of modern Peru was united into a single political and cultural unit, culminating in the [[Inca Empire]], followed by the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish conquest]]. At other stages, areas such as the [[Ica Valley]], a habitable region separated from others by desert, developed a distinctive culture of its own.&lt;ref name=Lanning&gt;{{cite book|title = Peru before the Incas| first=Edward P.| last=Lanning| publisher=Prentice-Hall| year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excavations in [[Ica Province]] were carried out in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by scholars such as [[Max Uhle]], [[Julio C. Tello]], [[Alfred L. Kroeber]], [[William Duncan Strong]] and [[John Howland Rowe]]. None of them reported the discovery of carved andesite stones. Nevertheless, carved stones which had been looted by ''huaqueros'', grave robbers, began to be offered for sale to tourists and amateur collectors.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a&gt;Pezzia Assereto, A (1968)  Ica y el Perú Precolombino. Tomo I. Arqueología de la provincia de Ica. Empresa Editora Liberia, Ojeda, Venezuela. 295 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these collectors was Santiago Agurto Calvo, an architect by profession, who was [[Rector (academia)|Rector]] of the [[National University of Engineering]] in [[Lima]]. He organised searches in ancient cemeteries, and in August 1966 found such a stone in the Toma Luz sector, Callango district, in [[Ica Valley]]. The context corresponded to the [[Tiwanaku]] culture. He reported his discovery to the Regional Museum in [[Ica city]], and was accompanied on further expeditions by its curator, the  archaeologist Alejandro Pezzia Assereto.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; In September 1966 in Uhle Hill cemetery, De la Banda sector, [[Ocucaje District]], they found, for the first time, an engraved stone with certain provenance in a tomb of the [[Paracas culture]]. This stone was a fairly flat and irregular in shape, approximately 7 x 6 x 2&amp;nbsp;cm in size. On it was carved a design which might be abstract, or could be taken as a flower with eight petals.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt; Agurto published the discovery in a Lima newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Agurto Calvo. "Las Piedras Magicas de Ocucaje". ''El Comercio''. Lima, 11 December 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

Pezzia continued to search. In the ''San Evaristo'' cemetery in Toma Luz, he found a carved stone of similar size to the previous one, with a realistic image of a fish. The context dated the tomb to the [[Middle Horizon]] (600-1000 A.D.). In a grave not far away in the same cemetery, he found a stone with the fairly realistic design of a [[llama]], in a context typical of the Ica culture. In 1968, Pezzia published his findings, including drawings and descriptions.&lt;ref name=Pezzia1968a/&gt;

==Popularization by Cabrera==
[[File:Ica stones1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|A collection of Ica stones surrounding a portrait of Javier Cabrera]]

Meanwhile, in 1966, Peruvian physician Javier Cabrera Darquea was presented with a stone that had a carved picture of a fish, which Cabrera believed to be of an extinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Message of the Stones |last= Cabrera |first= Javier |location= Ica, Peru |url= http://members.cox.net/icastones/02a-book-chapter-1.htm |accessdate= 10 May 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20111202175320/http://members.cox.net/icastones/02a-book-chapter-1.htm |archivedate= 2 December 2011 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cabrera's father had begun a collection of similar stones in the 1930s, and based on his interest in Peruvian prehistory, Cabrera began collecting more.  He initially purchased more than 300 from two brothers, Carlos and Pablo Soldi, who also collected pre-[[Inca Empire|Incan]] artifacts, who claimed they had unsuccessfully attempted to interest [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] in them.  Cabrera later found another source of the stones, a farmer named Basilio Uschuya, who sold him thousands more.  Cabrera's collection burgeoned, reaching more than 11,000 stones in the 1970s.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt; Cabrera published a book, ''The Message of the Engraved Stones of Ica'' on the subject, discussing his theories of the origins and meaning of the stones. In this he argued that the stones show "that man is at least 405 million years old" and for what he calls ''gliptolithic'' man, humans from another planet, and that "Through the transplantation of cognitive codes to highly intelligent primates, the men from outer space created new men on earth." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cabrera|first=Javier|title=The message of the engraved stones of Ica|year=2000|url=http://openlibrary.org/books/OL16716029M/The_message_of_the_engraved_stones_of_Ica}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ica stones achieved greater popular interest when Cabrera abandoned his medical career and opened a museum to feature several thousand of the stones in 1996.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;

In 1973, during an interview with [[Erich von Däniken]], Uschuya stated he had faked the stones that he had sold.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt;  In 1975 Uschuya and another farmer named Irma Gutierrez de Aparcana confirmed that they had forged the stones they gave to Cabrera by copying the images from comic books, text books and magazines.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;  Later, Uschuya recanted the forging story during an interview with a German journalist, saying that he had claimed they were a hoax to avoid imprisonment for selling [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]]. In 1977, during the [[BBC]] documentary ''Pathway to the Gods'', Uschuya produced an Ica stone with a dentist's drill and claimed to have produced a fake patina by baking the stone in cow dung.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt;  That same year, another BBC documentary was released with a skeptical analysis of Cabrera's stones, and the new-found attention to the phenomenon prompted Peruvian authorities to arrest Uschuya, as Peruvian law prohibits the sale of archaeological discoveries. Uschuya recanted his claim that he had found them and instead admitted they were [[hoax]]es, saying "Making these stones is easier than farming the land." He engraved the stones using images in books and magazines as examples and knives, chisels and a dental drill.&lt;ref name=" Feder 2010a"&gt;[[Kenneth L. Feder]], ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The Walam Olum'', pages 143 (Greenwood, 2010). {{ISBN|978-0-313-37919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that he had not made all the stones. He was not punished, and continued to sell similar stones to tourists as trinkets.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt;  The stones continued to be made and carved by other artists as forgeries of the original forgeries.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;

==Impact==
Except in the rare cases that [[provenance]] is known, there is no reliable way of dating the stones.&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt; Thus, a stone of uncertain origin can never be used to establish a conclusion which would otherwise be considered unlikely. The stones have been used by some [[Creationism|creationists]] to claim that humans lived in proximity with dinosaurs, which contradicts evidence that the [[extinction of dinosaurs]] predates mankind by approximately 66 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What really happened when the dino killer asteroid struck?|url=http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20160415-what-really-happened-when-the-dino-killer-asteroid-struck|website=BBC.com|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one official creationist source has rejected their use as an argument for creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ica Stones Bad Arguments|url=https://creation.com/ica-stones-bad-arguments|website=creation.com|publisher=Creation Ministries International|accessdate=3 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Believers in [[ancient astronauts]] have also attempted to use the stones as evidence of a lost, advanced civilization brought to man from other planets&lt;ref name = Fortean/&gt; and mytho-historians have claimed them as evidence that ancient myths are accurate histories, neither of which is a position supported in the scientific or academic communities.&lt;ref name = Skepdic/&gt;

In his ''Encyclopedia of Dubious Archaeology: From Atlantis To The [[Walam Olum]]'', archaeologist [[Ken Feder]] commented "The Ica Stones are not the most sophisticated of the archaeological hoaxes discussed in this book, but they certainly rank up there as the most preposterous."&lt;ref name=" Feder 2010a"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11392">'''James Thomas Hooper''' (1 September 1897 – 9 February 1971) was a British collector of ethnographic artifacts of the Inuit, Native American, Oceanic and African peoples.

Hooper was born in North Wraxall-Wiltshire&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Hooper, James Thomas | work = Danster Who's Who in African Art | url = http://www.danster-research.com/bin/who/htmlwho.cgi?search=2016213~01 | accessdate = 24 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1897 and began collecting in 1912 when his father gave him a native spear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = TOTEM MUSEUM video newsreel film  |publisher = British Pathe | url = http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=734 | accessdate = 22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became an employee of the Thames Conservancy Board&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Hall |first=Michael |title=BOOK OF THE YEAR |work=Apollo Magazine |date=3 December 2007 |url=http://www.apollo-magazine.com/features/384731/book-of-the-year.thtml |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121101071045/http://www.apollo-magazine.com/features/384731/book-of-the-year.thtml |dead-url=yes |archive-date= 1 November 2012 |accessdate=22 July 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but collecting was his obsession. He scoured flea markets and small antique shops in rural England for items of interest as well as purchasing from auction houses, private museums and house sales. He also organised exchanges with other dealers and collectors such as [[William Ockelford Oldman]] and [[Kenneth Athol Webster]].

At the height of his collecting in the 1950s, he was one of the top four collectors of pacific ethnographic material in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Tatua (belt) | work = Collections Online |publisher = Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa | url = http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/ObjectDetails.aspx?oid=53958 | accessdate = 21 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others included [[Kenneth Athol Webster]] and [[William Ockelford Oldman]]. Hooper's interest in collecting this material was ethnological rather than aesthetic. Like Oldman, Hooper never left Great Britain to visit the cultures that created the material he enjoyed.

After his retirement, Hooper opened the Totems Museum in Arundel, Sussex, United Kingdom in a two-story building on the High Street. He ran this museum between 1957 and 1963. The ground-floor rooms were packed full of his ethnographic collection while he and his grandson, Steven Hooper, lived in the rooms above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Hooper | first = Steven | title = STEVEN HOOPER | work = Art and Divinity in Polynesia, 1760-1860 | url = http://www.quaibranly.fr/uploads/tx_gayafeespacepresse/MQB-DP-Polynesie-arts-divinites-1760-1860-EN.pdf | accessdate = 22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Pathe newsreel film dated 9 December 1957 follows a couple visiting the Totems Museum. While the film gives little information when describing the treasures of the museum, close attention to the background and general shots of the interior of the museum give an excellent insight into the size, diversity and quality of Hooper's collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = TOTEM MUSEUM video newsreel film  |publisher = British Pathe | url = http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=734 | accessdate = 22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, he co-authored the publication ''The Art of Primitive Peoples'' with Cottie Arthur Burland. In it, Hooper concentrates on the [[art of Polynesia]], Melanesia, North Coast of America, Eskimo, West Africa and the Congo. His text is illustrated with 116 photographs of items from his collection taken by R.H. Bomback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The art of primitive peoples / by J.T. Hooper and C.A.

Hooper's collection continued to be documented after his death in 1971. His collection was the subject of a book by his grandson Steven Phelps – now known as Steven Hooper. ''Art and Artifacts of the Pacific, Africa and the Americas: The James Hooper Collection'' was published in 1976 and featured 250 illustrations. Soon after this book was published, parts of the collection began to be auctioned by Christie's. Between 1976 and 1982 there were at least six auctions of material from the James Hooper Collection. The auctions included ''African Art from the James Hooper Collection'' held on 14 July 1976 at Christie's London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = African Art from the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 14 July 1976 | location = London | pages =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''American Indian Art from the James Hooper Collection'' held on 9 Nov 1976 at Christie's London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = American Indian Art from the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 9 Nov 1976 | location = London | pages = , 207 lots auctioned, 207 lots illustrated | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hawaiian and Maori Art from the James Hooper Collection'' held on 21 June 1977 at Christie's London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Hawaiian and Maori Art from the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 21 June 1977 | location = London | pages = 61, 203 lots auctioned, 196 lots illustrated | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Melanesian and Polynesian Art from the James Hooper Collection'' held on 19 June 1979 at Christie's London,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Melanesian and Polynesian Art from the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 19 June 1979 | location = London | pages = 63, 198 lots auctioned, 198 lots illustrated | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oceanic Art From the James Hooper Collection'' held on 17 June 1980 at Christie's London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Oceanic Art From the James Hooper Collection | publisher = Christie's | date = 17 June 1980 | location = London | pages = 56, 160 lots auctioned, 151 lots illustrated | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Important Tribal Art'' held on 7 July 1982 at Christie's London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Important Tribal Art from the properties of ...

{{nihongo|'''''Maki-e'''''|蒔絵||literally: sprinkled picture}} is [[Japanese lacquerware|Japanese lacquer]] sprinkled with gold or silver powder as a decoration using a ''makizutsu'' or a [[kebo]] brush. The technique was developed mainly in the [[Heian period]] (794–1185) and blossomed in the [[Edo period]] (1603–1868). Maki-e objects were initially designed as household items for court nobles; they soon gained more popularity and were adopted by royal families and military leaders as a symbol of power.

To create different colours and textures, maki-e artists use a variety of metal powders including gold, silver, copper, brass, lead, aluminum, platinum, and pewter, as well as their alloys. Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines. As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting, young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters. Kōami Dōchō (1410–1478) was the first lacquer master linked to specific works. His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters. Kōami and another maki-e master, Igarashi Shinsai, were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of [[Japan]].

Takamakie (or "raised maki-e") is one of the three major techniques in maki-e making. Developed in the [[Muromachi period]] (1336–1573), the technique of takamakie involves building up design patterns above the surface through a mixture of metal powder, lacquer, and charcoal or clay dust.

Another special kind of maki-e is togidashi maki-e, where a black lacquer without oil is put on the metal decoration as an additional coat.

{{Zoroastrianism}}
'''Middle Persian literature''' is the corpus of written works composed in [[Middle Persian]], that is, the [[Middle Iranian]] dialect of [[Persis|Persia proper]], the region in the south-western corner of the [[Iranian plateau]]. Middle Persian was the prestige dialect during the era of [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid dynasty]]. 

The rulers of the [[Sassanid Empire]] (224–654 CE) were natives of that south-western region, and through their political and cultural influence, Middle Persian became a [[prestige dialect]] and thus also came to be used by non-Persian Iranians. Following the [[Rashidun conquest of the Sassanian Empire|Arab conquest of the Sassanian Empire]] in the 7th century, shortly after which Middle Persian began to evolve into New Persian, Middle Persian continued to be used by the Zoroastrian priesthood for religious and secular compositions. These compositions, in the Aramaic-derived [[Book Pahlavi]] script, are traditionally known as "Pahlavi literature". The earliest texts in Zoroastrian Middle Persian were probably written down in late Sassanid times (6th–7th centuries), although they represent the codification of earlier oral tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Sundermann, Werner. 1989. Mittelpersisch. P. 141. In ''Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum'' (ed. Rüdiger Schmidt).&lt;/ref&gt; However, most texts, including the [[Zend|''zand'']] commentaries and translations of the [[Avesta|Zoroastrian canon]], date from the 9th to the 11th century, when Middle Persian had long ceased to be a spoken language, so they reflect the state of affairs in living Middle Persian only indirectly. The surviving manuscripts are usually 14th-century copies.&lt;ref name="LLDescrip"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=pal|title=Linguist List - Description of Pehlevi|year=2007|publisher=Eastern Michigan University|location=Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other, less abundantly attested varieties of Middle Persian literature include the 'Manichaean Middle Persian' corpus, used for a sizable amount of [[Manichaean]] religious writings, including many theological texts, [[homily|homilies]] and hymns (3rd–9th, possibly 13th century). Even less-well attested are the Middle Persian compositions of [[Nestorian Christians]], evidenced in the [[Pahlavi Psalter]] (7th century); these were used until the beginning of the second millennium in many places in Central Asia, including [[Turfan]] (in present-day China) and even localities in Southern India.&lt;ref&gt;Sundermann, Werner. 1989. Mittelpersisch. P. 138. In ''Compendium Linguarum Iranicarum'' (ed. Rüdiger Schmidt).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgroups==
==="Pahlavi" literature===
"Pahlavi literature traditionally defines the writings of the Zoroastrians in the Middle Persian language and Book Pahlavi script which were compiled in the 9th and the 10th centuries CE."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Cereti|first=C. G.|chapter=Middle Persian literature I: Pahlavi Literature|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/middle-persian-literature-1-pahlavi|year=2009|location=New York|publisher=iranicaonline.org}}, accessed August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary corpus in Middle Persian in [[Book Pahlavi]] consists of:
* translations and commentaries (''[[Zend|zand]]'') of the [[Avesta]].
* other exegetical compositions on religious subjects.
* compositions on non-religious subjects.
These divisions are not mutually exclusive. Several different literary genres are represented in Pahlavi literature.

;''Zand'' texts 
The ''[[Zend|zand]]'' corpus include exegetical glosses, paraphrases, commentaries and translations of the [[Avesta]]'s texts. Although such exegetical commentaries also exist in other languages (including Avestan itself&lt;!-- Boyce, TS 1984, p=4--&gt;), the Middle Persian ''zand'' is the only to survive fully, and is for this reason regarded as 'the' ''zand''.&lt;ref name="BoyceTS"&gt;{{citation|last=Boyce|first=Mary|title=Textual Sources for the Study of Zoroastrianism|year=1984|publisher=Manchester UP}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the notable exception of the [[Yasht|''Yasht''s]], almost all surviving Avestan texts have their Middle Persian ''zand'', which in some manuscripts appear alongside (or interleaved with) the text being glossed. These glosses and commentaries were not intended for use as theological texts by themselves but for religious instruction of the (by then) non-Avestan-speaking public. In contrast, the Avestan language texts remained sacrosanct and continued to be recited in the Avestan language, which was considered a [[sacred language]].

;Other exegetical works
The corpus of medieval texts of Zoroastrian tradition include around 75 works, of which only a few are well known:
* the ''[[Denkard]]'', "Acts of Religion", is an encyclopedic compendium of Sassanid era beliefs and customs.
* the ''[[Bundahishn]]'', "Original Creation", is an important source of information on Zoroastrian cosmogony.
* Manushchihr's ''[[Dadestan-i Denig|Dadestan i Denig]]'' ("Religious Decisions") and [[Epistles of Manushchihr|''Epistles'']]
* the ''Vichitakiha i Zatsparam'', the "Treatises of Zatsparam", by Manushchihr's brother Zatsparam. 
* the ''[[Book of Arda Viraf|Arda-Viraf Namag]]'' relates the dream-journey of a devout Zoroastrian (the 'Viraf' of the story) through the next world.
* the ''[[Menog-i Khrad|Daedestan i Menog-i Khrad]]'', "Judgments of the Spirit of Wisdom", is an ''andarz'' text (a class of Iranian [[wisdom literature]]) in which a figure named Danag (lit: "wise, knowing") participates in a question-and-answer dialog with Menog-i Khrad, the Spirit of Wisdom.
* the ''[[Jamasp Namag]]'', "Book of Jamaspi", also known as the ''Ayadgar i Jamaspig'' "(In) Memoriam of Jamasp", is a compendium of essential doctrine, together with basic myth, legend, history, and some pseudo-prophetic matters cast as a series of revelations by Jamasp through the model of a question-and-answer dialog with [[Vishtaspa|Vishtasp]].
* the ''[[Zand-i Wahman yasn]]'' is another pseudo-prophetic text, in this case cast as a question-and-answer dialog between Zoroaster and Ahura Mazda, in which the latter gives his prophet the ability to see into the future.
* the ''[[Shikand-gumanic Vichar]]'', a partly apologetic and partly polemic review of other religions.
* the ''[[Shayast ne-shayast]]'', "(on what is) Proper and Improper", a compilation of miscellaneous laws and customs regarding sin and impurity, with other memoranda about ceremonies and religious subjects in general.

;Secular compositions
A manuscript known as the "miscellaneous codex" or ''MK'' (after Mihraban Kaykhusrow, the Indian Zoroastrian copyist who created it), dated to 1322 but containing older material, is the only surviving source of several secular Middle Persian works from the Sassanian period. Among the texts included in the unique ''MK'' are:
* the ''[[Kar-Namag i Ardashir i Pabagan]]'' is a hagiography of [[Ardashir I]], the founder of the Sassanid dynasty
* the ''Ayadgar i Zareran'', the "Memorial or Zarer", is the only surviving specimen of Iranian epic poetry composed in Middle Persian.
* the ''[[Sahrestaniha i Eransahr|Shahrestaniha i Eranshahr]]'', is a catalogue of the four regions of the Sassanid empire with mythical and/or historical stories related to their founding.
* several ''andarz'' texts, the Iranian type of [[wisdom literature]] containing advice and injunctions for proper behavior. 
* the ''Wizarishn i Chatrang'', "Explanation of Chess", also known as the ''Chatrang Namag'', is a humorous story of how an Indian king sent a game of chess to the Sassanid court to test Iranian wits, in response to which a priest invented backgammon to challenge the Indian king.
* the ''[[Drakht-i Asurig|Drakht i Asurig]]'', "the Assyrian tree", is an originally Parthian poem recast into Book Pahlavi but retaining many Parthian phrases and idioms.
* the ''Abdih ud Sahigih i Sagistan'' is a description of the "Wonders and Remarkable Features of Sistan".
* the ''Khusraw va Redag'', "Khusraw and the Page", is an account of a conversation between the king and a young boy who would like to be a page. This work is a source of information on the sensual delights of the Sassanian court.

Especially important to cultural and law historians is the ''Madayan i Hazar Dadestan'', "Book of a Thousand Judgements", a 7th-century compilation of actual and hypothetical case histories collected from Sassanian court records and transcripts. Only a single manuscript of this unique text survives.

Scribes also created several glossaries for translating foreign languages. Of these, two have survived:
* ''[[Frahang-i Pahlavig]]'', a glossary of common [[Heterogram (literature)|Aramaic heterograms]] (''[[huzvarishn]]'') used in written Middle Persian. 
* ''[[Frahang-i Oim-evak]]'', a dictionary of [[Avestan]] words and phrases.

Several other works, now lost, are known of from references to them in other languages. Works of this group include: 
* in about the 5th century, priests attached to the Sassanid court began to compile an immense chronicle, the ''Khwaday Namag'' ("Book of Kings"), a legendary genealogy of the Sassanid kings in which the Sassanians were dynastically linked to [[Vishtaspa]],&lt;ref name="BoyceTS" /&gt; i.e. Zoroaster's patron and the legendary founder of the mythological [[Kayanian dynasty]]. The original Middle Persian version of the chronicle has been lost, and the contents survive only through Arabic translations and in a versified New Persian version, the ''[[Shahnameh]]'' by Firdausi, finished around 1000 CE.&lt;ref name="BoyceTS" /&gt;
* the ''Kalile va Demne'', a Middle Persian translation of the Indian [[Panchatantra]]. The Middle Persian work survives only as a translation into [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and two centuries later into Arabic by [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|Ibn al-Muqaffa]].
* the ''[[Letter of Tansar]]'', a rationale for Ardashir's seizure of the throne. The letter was translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in the 9th century by [[Abdullah Ibn al-Muqaffa|Ibn al-Muqaffa]], and from Arabic into [[New Persian]] in the 13th century ''History of Tabaristan'' by Ibn Isfandiar.
* the ''Ayyatkar-i Anushirvan'', which has survived as an Arabic translation in a section of [[Ebn Meskavayh]]'s ''Tajarib al-Umam''.

[[File:Mundas-et-Infans-frontispiece-1522.png|thumb|The 1522 cover of ''[[The World and the Child|Mundus et Infans]]'', a morality play]]
The '''morality play''' is a [[genre]] of [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] and [[Tudor period|early Tudor]] theatrical entertainment. In their own time, these plays were known as '''''interludes''''', a broader term for dramas with or without a [[moral]].&lt;ref&gt;Richardson and Johnston (1991, 97-98).&lt;/ref&gt; Morality plays are a type of [[allegory]] in which the [[protagonist]] is met by [[personification]]s of various [[morality|moral]] attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil. The plays were most popular in [[Europe]] during the 15th and 16th centuries. Having grown out of the religiously based [[mystery play]]s of the Middle Ages, they represented a shift towards a more secular base for European theatre. [[Hildegard von Bingen]]'s ''[[Ordo Virtutum]]'' (English: "Order of the Virtues") composed c. 1151, is the earliest known morality play by more than a century, and the only Medieval musical drama to survive with an attribution for both the text and the music.

==Characteristics==
Morality plays typically contain a protagonist who represents either humanity as a whole or a smaller social structure. Supporting characters are personifications of good and evil. This alignment of characters provides the play’s audience with moral guidance. Morality plays are the result of the dominant belief of the time period, that humans had a certain amount of control over their post-death fate while they were on earth.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. "Morality Plays". ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 235. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'', perhaps the archetypal morality play, the characters take on the common pattern, representing broader ideas. Some of the characters in ''Everyman'' are God, Death, Everyman, Good-Deeds, Angel, Knowledge, Beauty, Discretion, and Strength. The personified meanings of these characters are hardly hidden. The premise of ''Everyman'' is that God, believing that the people on earth are too focused on wealth and worldly possessions, sends Death to Everyman to remind him of God's power and the importance of upholding values.&lt;ref&gt;''Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays''. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 36-59. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis put on morality, the seemingly vast difference between good and evil, and the strong presence of God makes ''Everyman'' one of the most concrete examples of a morality play. At the same time, most morality plays focus more on evil, while ''Everyman'' focuses more on good, highlighting sin in contrast.&lt;ref&gt;King, Pamela M. "Morality Plays". ''The Cambridge Companion to Medieval English Theatre''. Ed. Richard Beadle. Cambridge: Cambridge U P, 1994. 257. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other plays that take on the typical traits of morality plays, but are rarely given the title of "morality play" are ''Hickscorner'' and ''The Second Shepherds' Play.'' The characters in ''Hickscorner'' are Pity, Perseverance, Imagination, Contemplation, Freewill, and Hickscorner. They blatantly represent moral ideals.&lt;ref&gt;
Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 60. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Second Shepherds' Play'', the characters are less obviously representative of good and evil, being primarily a trio of shepherds. But other characters such as Mary, The Child Christ, and An Angel show a strong moral presence and the importance of God in the play.&lt;ref&gt;
Everyman and Other Miracle and Morality Plays. Ed. Stanley Appelbaum and Candace Ward. New York: Dover Publications, 1995. 12-35. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justice and Equity as characters==
In early English dramas [[Justice]] was personified as an entity which exercised “theological virtue or grace, and was concerned with the divine pronouncement of judgment on man”.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson. "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 406.&lt;/ref&gt; However, as time progressed, more moralities began to emerge; it is during this transitional period where one begins to see [[Justice]] begin to assume more and more the qualities of a judge.  The Justice in ''Respublica'' begins to concern himself with administering justice on “the criminal element”, rather than with the divine pronouncement on a generic representative of mankind.&lt;ref name="Respublica 1905"&gt;''Respublica'', ed. by Leonard A. Magnus (London, 1905), Extra Series XCIV.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first instance where one may observe a direct divergence from the theological virtues and concerns that were previously exerted by Justice in the morality plays of the fifteenth century. The Justice in ''Respublica'' is personified as a “civil force rather than a theological one”.&lt;ref name="Respublica 1905"/&gt; An evolution of sorts takes place within the morals and agendas of Justice, he begins to don on the Judicial Robe of prosecutor and executioner.

Another change envelops in the character of Justice during the sixteenth century in morality plays; [[Equity (law)|Equity]] replaces Justice and assumes the judiciary duties previously performed by Justice. This changing of rulers, or preceding justices, is done when Equity declares that his brother Justice has been banished from the country and that he (Equity) will from now on take on the duties of the former monarch, Justice.&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 408.&lt;/ref&gt; This change of ruling heads is portrayed in the morality play, ''Liberality and Prodigality'', where Equity serves Virtue in the detection, arrest, and punishment of Prodigality for the robbery and murder of Tenacity, a yeoman in the country of Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;''Liberality and Prodigality'', in ''A Select Collection of Old English Plays''. ed. by W. Carew Hazlitt (London, 1874), VIII, 329-83.&lt;/ref&gt; Virtue states,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
So horrible a fact can hardly pleaded for favour:&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore go you, Equity, examine more diligently&lt;br /&gt;
The manner of this outrageous robbery:&lt;br /&gt;
And as the same by examination shall appear,&lt;br /&gt;
Due justice may be done in presence here.&lt;br /&gt; (''Liberality and Prodigality'' 377)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The meta phases that Justice undergoes during the sixteenth century in morality plays, from “Justice” to “Equity” further illustrates the evolution of Justice; not only did Justice change from a “theological abstraction to a civil servant”,&lt;ref&gt;McCutchan, J. Wilson . "Justice and Equity in the English Morality Play."Journal of the History of Ideas. 19.3 (1958): 409.&lt;/ref&gt; but he experienced a corporeal change as well.

One may readily observe the evolutionary progression of Justice as portrayed in the plays of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One encounters Justice in the early-fifteenth-century moralities as a performer playing the role of a theological virtue or grace, and then one sees him develop to a more serious figure, occupying the position of an arbiter of justice during the sixteenth century. It is a journey of discovery and great change on which Justice welcomes one to embark as one leafs through the pages of morality plays.

==Pre-Reformation versus post-Reformation==
Although the purpose of all morality plays is to instruct listeners on the means of receiving redemption, morality plays after the [[Protestant Reformation]] are of a distinctly different [[didacticism]] than the morality plays before the Reformation.

Morality plays before the Reformation teach a [[Catholic Church |Catholic]] approach to redemption, with an emphasis on works and the sacraments, a view originating with [[Tertullian]] (c. 155 – c. 240 AD) and [[Cyprian]] (d. 258). The emphasis on works can be seen in the final speech in one of the most well-known of medieval morality plays, [[Everyman (play)|Everyman]], in which there is a clear statement about the necessity of good works for the one who desires heaven:
&lt;poem&gt; 
Doctor:  This moral men may have in mind;
Ye hearers, take it of worth, old and young,
And forsake pride, for he deceiveth you in the end,
And remember Beauty, Five-wits, Strength, and Discretion,
They all at last do Everyman forsake,
Save his Good-Deeds, there doth he take.
But beware, and they be small
Before God, he hath no help at all.
None excuse may be there for Everyman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cawley |first=A. C.|title=Everyman and Medieval Miracle Plays |date=1974 |publisher= Dent |location=London |isbn=978-0-460-87280-5 |page =225}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
The importance of the sacraments is seen in the morality tale entitled [[Mankind (play)]].  In this play, the [[sacrament of penance]] is emphasized when the allegorical character Mercy speaks to Mankind:  “Come let us go to this cloister and incline your mind towards God.  Don’t sin thinking that you are assured mercy, that itself is a sin.  It’s not a good idea to take advantage of the Lord.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1= McDonald |first1= Rick |title= Modern English Translation of Mankind |url= http://research.uvu.edu/mcdonald/3610/mankind.html |publisher =Utah Valley University|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Pre-Reformation plays emphasized the importance of the [[sacraments of the Catholic Church]] (such as partaking in mass and baptism), the church clergy, the church hierarchy, the church establishment in general, and the abstinence from the [[Seven Deadly Sins]]. Many of the morality tales were [[allegory |allegories]] and involved characters with names of Vices (e.g., Gluttony) and Virtues (e.g., Goodness).  Their purpose was to direct the playgoers to pursue virtue and renounce vice.

Frequently a character representing a Vice would state, upon his first appearance, that he was evil.  For example, in [[The Castle of Perseverance]], a character called Lust-Liking states:
&lt;poem&gt;
Lo, me! here ready Lord, to fare and to flee
To seek thee a servant valued and dear!
Whoso will by Folly ruled be, 
He is worthy to be a servant here,
Who slips into the Sins Seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Johnston |first =Alexandra F.|title=The Castle of Perseverance: A Modernization |url= http://homes.chass.utoronto.ca/~ajohnsto/cascomp.html |website= Computing in the Humanities and Social Sciences |publisher= University of Toronto|accessdate=7 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;
Even after this initial introduction, however, the Vice will continually reiterate to the audience that his nature is diabolic. Very often, the Vice presented will bring his character into criticism by the manner in which he presents himself to his audience, thus further demonstrating his wickedness. For example, the Vices in the earlier morality plays often spoke using vulgar language and by blasphemous swearing.  Often, these curses were spoken in [[Latin]], which being considered the holy language, made these curses even more offensive to the audience.  Moreover, the Vices often made a mockery of religious practices sacred to the audience, thereby castigating themselves in the eyes of their audience. Deceit is another means by which the Vice exposes his wickedness to the audience and serves as an example to them of what to avoid in a righteous life. Furthermore, in the pre-Reformation play, the Vices denounce their own characters by acting violently toward each other, and toward the Virtues.&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962"&gt;{{Citation | last = Pineas | first = Rainer | title = The English Morality Play as a Weapon of Religious Controversy | journal = Studies in English Literature | volume = 2 | number = 2 | year = 1962 | pages = 157–80 | publisher = JSTOR | format = Web | accessdate = 28 September 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas the pre-Reformation morality plays sought to reinforce the establishment of the Catholic Church and Catholic doctrine, the post-Reformation morality plays worked to destroy Catholic credibility and demonise the Catholic Church.  Although post-Reformation morality plays were like its predecessor in that it also was concerned with the salvation of its audience, it differed in that it believed that the theology promoted by pre-Reformation plays was antithetical to salvation. Thus, a major shift in focus, from concern for the individual’s moral behaviour to concern for the individual's theological practices, occurred with the post-Reformation morality plays. The wave of [[Protestantism]] which fuelled the content of these plays dictated that more attention should be given to warning people against the Catholic Church than of their sinful nature.  The means of redemption, according to the philosophy embedded in post-Reformation morality plays, is dependent upon the audience understanding the truthfulness of Protestant theology and verses and also the deceptiveness and wickedness of Catholic theology, whose best example is the secular play of Calderón.&lt;ref name="Muratta Bunsen, Eduardo 2014"&gt;{{Citation | last = Muratta Bunsen | first = Eduardo | title = Leidenschaft des Zweifelns: Skepsis und Probabilismus in den Säkulardramen von Pedro Calderón de la Barca | language = de | publisher = FU | place = Berlin, DE | url = http://www.geisteswissenschaften.fu-berlin.de/we05/forschung/dissertationen/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vices in post-Reformation morality plays are almost always depicted as being Catholic. At times this depiction is achieved through their physical appearance. For example, Vices in post-Reformation morality plays would be dressed as cardinals, friars, monks, or the pope. Other times, the Vice comes out and states he is a Catholic, or elucidates that he is Catholic by swearing a Catholic pledge.  Oftentimes, the Vice in post-Reformation plays admits that Catholic theology is flawed, and that by being Catholic the Vice is committing treason.  Moreover, Vices often appear ignorant and naive, especially when it comes to their biblical understanding and knowledge of the [[New Testament]]. Often, morality plays coming out the post-Reformation period ridicule ritualistic Catholic practices. Furthermore, these plays postulated that Catholics were opposed to moral behaviour and truthfulness, and that the Catholic Church warped the text of the Bible to justify sinning. To deceive the victim of post-Reformation morality plays, the Vice typically assumes a new name to disguise what actual Vice he is.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

Because the Vice is aggressively tied to Catholicism from the outset of the play, when the Vice is reprimanded and damned, so are his Catholic beliefs. Therefore, the Vice served as a central component to discrediting the Catholic Church in post-Reformation morality plays.&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962" /&gt;

The role of the Virtues in post-Reformation morality plays was to preach a message of salvation based upon an individual’s faith and the grace of God. They promoted Protestant beliefs of [[original sin]], the importance of bible reading and meditation, the marriage of clergymen, and the cleansing of sin only through Christ’s sacrifice; at the same time, they discredited the Catholic belief in [[transubstantiation]].&lt;ref name= "Pineas, Rainer 1962" /&gt;

The '''Orrin G. Hatch–Bob Goodlatte Music Modernization Act''', or '''Music Modernization Act''' or '''MMA''' ({{USBill|115|HR|1551}}, {{USPL|115|264}}) is United States legislation signed into law on October 11, 2018 aimed to modernize [[copyright]]-related issues for music and audio recordings due to new forms of technology like [[Streaming media|digital streaming]]. It is a consolidation of three separate bills introduced during the [[115th United States Congress]].

== Enjoined bills ==
The MMA is a combination of three bills previously introduced in Congress.&lt;ref name="verge passage"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/11/17963804/music-modernization-act-mma-copyright-law-bill-labels-congress | title = The Music Modernization Act has been signed into law | first =Dani  |last =Deahl | date = October 11, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Title I: Music Modernization Act ===
The singular Act was first introduced into the House by Rep. [[Bob Goodlatte]] on December 17, 2017 ({{USBill|115|H.R.|4706}}), and later to the Senate by Sen. [[Orrin Hatch]] on January 24, 2018. Both versions of the bill looked to improve how music licensing and royalties would be paid in consideration of streaming media services. The bill established three major provisions:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/26/16931966/congress-music-modernization-act-licensing-royalties | title = Congress may actually fix music royalties | first=  Micah | last =Singleton | date = January 26, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# It would set up a non-profit governing agency that would create a database related to the owners of the [[mechanical license]] of sound recordings - the copyright that covers the composition and lyrics of a song; the actual performance and recording of the song is typically held under a different license. The database would be completed with help of the major music publishers. The new agency would establish blanket royalty rates that would be used to pay the composers and songwriters when used by streaming services using this database, eliminating the difficulty previously faced by streaming services to properly identify the mechanical license holder. These royalties would be paid to the non-profit agency as a [[compulsory license]], not requiring the mechanical license holder's permission; the agency would then be responsible for distributing the royalties. Streaming services would still be able to negotiate other royalty rates directly with the mechanical license owner if they so chose.
# It assures that songwriters are paid a portion of mechanical license royalties for either physical or digital reproduction of a song with their lyrics, at a rate set by contract.
# It revamps the rate court process when disagreements over royalty rates arise. Prior, a single judge in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]] was assigned to handle all cases; the bill would assign a random judge in this Court to oversee these cases.
In addition, elements of the "Fair Play Fair Pay Act", {{USBill|115|H.R.|1836}}, introduced on March 30, 2017 by Rep. [[Jerrold Nadler]] were added to this Title. The Fair Play Fair Pay Act had been designed to harmonize how royalties were paid by terrestrial radio broadcasters and Internet streaming services. Under previous law, songwriters and composers would receive mechanical license royalties for radio play, but the performing artists would not be paid as the use of songs on the radio was considered "promotional". The Fair Play Fair Pay Act had included language that would allow recording artists to receive performance royalties. However, these parts of the Fair Play Fair Pay Act were not included in the combined Music Modernization Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/music-modernization-act-to-be-introduced-tuesday-1202748355/ | title = Music Modernization Act to Be Introduced Tuesday | first = Paula | last = Parisi | date = April 9, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Title II: CLASSICS Act ===
{{main|CLASSICS Act}}
The Compensating Legacy Artists for their Songs, Service, and Important Contributions to Society (CLASSICS) Act was originally introduced in the House as {{USBill|115|H.R.|3301}} in July 2017. In US Copyright Law, sound recordings made prior to February 15, 1972 were not covered under federal copyright law, leaving them up to the individual states to pass laws for recording protection. This had created a complex series of laws that made it difficult for copyright enforcement and royalty payments. The CLASSICS Act established that sound recording before 1972 are covered by copyright until February 15, 2067, with additional language to grandfather in older songs into the public domain at an earlier time. Recordings prior to 1923 will enter the public domain three years from passage (January 1, 2022, as all U.S. copyright terms end on December 31), and with recordings between 1923 and 1956 being phased into the public domain over the next few decades.

=== Title III: Allocation for Music Producers Act ===
The Allocation for Music Producers (AMP) Act bill was introduced by Rep. [[Joseph Crowley]] on February 6, 2017 as {{USBill|115|H.R.|881}}. The bill designates that [[SoundExchange]], the non-profit organization established by Congress to distribute royalties on sound recordings, to also distribute part of those royalties to "a producer, mixer, or sound engineer who was part of the creative process that created [the] sound recording".

==Passage==
The three bills were consolidated in the House by Goodlatte on April 10, 2018 as {{USBill|115|H.R.|5447}} , which passed the bill on April 25, 2018. Hatch introduced the combined bill in the Senate as {{USBill|115|S.|2823}} on May 10, 2018. During the Senate's review, the body voted to move the bill to an existing, unrelated bill, {{USBill|115|H.R.|1551}}, which the House agreed to. The Senate voted in favor of the bill on September 19, 2018, and was subsequently signed into law by President [[Donald Trump]] on October 11, 2018.&lt;ref name="verge passage"/&gt; Among those in attendance at the signing were musicians [[Kid Rock]], [[Mike Love]], [[Sam Moore]], [[John Rich]], [[Craig Morgan]] and [[Jeff Baxter]], and the Christian group [[MercyMe]]. While [[Kanye West]] had been reported to be attended the signing, he was not present though had a luncheon with President Trump later that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/trump-signs-music-modernization-act-736185/ | title = Trump Signs Landmark Music Bill Into Law | first = Amy | last = Wang | date = October 11, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work =[[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/politics/news/trump-signs-music-modernization-act-1202976848/ | title = Trump Signs Sweeping New Music Licensing Legislation | first = Ted | last = Johnson |date = October 11, 2018 | accessdate= October 11, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
The bills in both House and Senate had bipartisan support, as well as strong support from numerous music industry groups representing musicians, producers, and publishers, as well as from digital streaming media services and related industry groups.&lt;ref name="variety support"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://variety.com/2018/music/news/senate-passes-music-modernization-act-1202947518/ | title = Senate Passes Music Modernization Act | date = September 18, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Digital streaming platforms [[Apple Music]] and [[Spotify]] had both come under prior separate legal actions for unpaid royalties for streaming music in part due to a lack of a central database for which to track down songwriters and composers, and had even set aside part of their working capital to deal with legal issues in order to offer full music catalogs, in contrast to [[Amazon.com]]'s music selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/wixens-1-6-billion-spotify-lawsuit-what-you-need-to-know-202532/ | title = Wixen’s $1.6 Billion Spotify Lawsuit: What You Need to Know | first =Daniel | last =Kreps | date = January 3, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[Rolling Stone]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =  https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/14/17117160/spotify-mechanical-license-copyright-wixen-explainer  | title = A $1.6 BILLION SPOTIFY LAWSUIT IS BASED ON A LAW MADE FOR PLAYER PIANOS | first = Sarah | last =Jeong | date = March 14, 2018 | accessdate = October 11, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17927852/music-modernization-act-streaming-monetization-meredith-rose-vergecast | title = How the Music Modernization Act will help artists get paid more from streaming | first = Nilay | last = Patel | date = October 2, 2018 | accessdate = October 21, 2018 | work = [[The Verge]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a last-minute conflict in the Senate, brought up by [[SESAC]] and [[SiriusXM]], relating to royalties for pre-1972 sound recordings, but a deal was made between SiriusXM, the [[National Music Publishers Association]] and the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] which allowed the bill to be passed by the Senate by a unanimous vote, allowing the bill to quickly pass through Congress via "hotlining" before the end of the session.&lt;ref name="variety support"/&gt;

[[File:Northumberlandia - facial shot.jpg|thumb|right|The head pictured from below showing lips, nostrils, eyes and forehead]]
'''''Northumberlandia''''' (the "Lady of the North") is a huge land sculpture in the shape of a reclining female figure, which was completed in 2012, near [[Cramlington]], [[Northumberland]], northern [[England]]. 

Made of 1.5 million tonnes of earth from neighbouring [[Shotton Surface Mine]], it is {{convert|34|m|ft|abbr=off}} high and {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=off}} long, set in a {{convert|19|ha|acre|abbr=off}} public park. Its creators claim that it is the largest land sculpture in female form in the world.&lt;ref name="cramlington" /&gt;

It is intended to be a major tourist attraction, with the developers hoping that it will attract an additional 200,000 visitors a year to Northumberland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

the sculpture was built on the [[Blagdon Hall|Blagdon Estate]], owned by [[Matthew White Ridley, 5th Viscount Ridley|Matt Ridley]], a journalist, businessman and author of ''[[The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature]]''.&lt;ref name=Mail/&gt;

The £2.5 million cost was borne by the Blagdon Estate and the [[Banks Group]], who carried out the construction work. The construction is part of the development of an adjacent [[open-cast mining|open-cast]] [[Coal-mining|coal mine]] at [[Shotton, Northumberland|Shotton]]. For this project, it was decided to use part of the excavated material to make a land sculpture rather than return it all to the surface mine, as is normally done at the end of such operations.

'''''Pan''''' is a public artwork by sculptor [[Roger White (sculptor)|Roger White]] located at the [[Indiana World War Memorial Plaza]] in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]], [[United States]]. This work was originally surveyed in 1993 as part of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian's]] [[Save Outdoor Sculpture!]] program. A former water fountain, this piece is part of a [[National Historic Landmark District]].&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculpture | year=1993 | title=Syrinx (sculpture). | work=SOS | publisher=Smithsonian | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!314194~!0#focus | accessdate= 6 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Pan Label.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Plaque]]
It is a [[bronze]] figure of [[Pan (god)|Pan]] sitting on a [[limestone]] tree stump. Pan is [[Nude (art)|nude]] and his furry proper right knee is bent upwards to his chest with his other leg hangs over the side of the stump. The [[satyr]] holds a [[pan flute]] in his hand, holding it up to his mouth, as if playing it for nearby [[Syrinx (sculpture)|''Syrinx'']].&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Information==

''Pan'' was originally designed by [[Myra Reynolds Richards]]. Richards' original ''Syrinx'' and ''Pan'' sculptures were dedicated in 1923. Eventually, both pieces were stolen, with ''Syrinx'' disappearing in 1959 and ''Pan'' c. 1970.  The parks department commissioned [[Adolph Wolter]] to replace the pieces, and in 1973 they were reinstalled in their current location in University Park at the [[Indiana World War Memorial Plaza]]. However, Wolter's ''Pan'' would eventually be stolen as well, and sculptor Roger White was commissioned to replace the piece. ''Pan'' was replaced in 1980 by White.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5091">'''Pohlke's theorem''' is the fundamental theorem of [[axonometry]]. It was established 1853 by the German painter and teacher of [[descriptive geometry]] [[Karl Wilhelm Pohlke]]. The first proof of the theorem was published 1864 by the German mathematician [[Hermann Amandus Schwarz]], who was a student of Pohlke. Therefore the theorem is sometimes called '''theorem of Pohlke and Schwarz''', too.

== The theorem ==
[[File:Axonom-pohlke.svg|thumb|Pohlke's theorem]]
*Three arbitrary line sections &lt;math&gt;\overline O\overline U,\overline O\overline V,\overline O\overline W&lt;/math&gt; in a plane originating at point &lt;math&gt; \overline O&lt;/math&gt;, which are not contained in a line, can be considered as the [[parallel projection]] of three edges &lt;math&gt;OU,OV,OW&lt;/math&gt; of a [[cube]].
For a mapping of a unit cube, one has to apply an additional scaling either in the space or in the plane. Because a parallprojection and a scaling preserves ratios one can map an arbitrary point &lt;math&gt;P=(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; by the axonometric procedure below.

Pohlke's theorem can be stated in terms of linear algebra as:
*Any [[Affine transformation|affine mapping]] of the 3-dimesional space onto a plane can be considered as the composition of a [[Similarity (geometry)|similarity]] and a parallel projection.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pickert: ''Vom Satz von Pohlke zur linearen Algebra'', Didaktik der Mathematik 11 (1983), 4, pp. 297–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application to axonometry ==
[[File:Axonom-def.svg|thumb|the principle of axonometric projection]]
Pohlke's theorem is the justification for the following easy procedure to construct a scaled parallel projection of a 3-dimensional object using coordinates,:&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Graf, Martin Barner: ''Darstellende Geometrie.'' Quelle &amp; Meyer, Heidelberg 1961, {{ISBN|3-494-00488-9}}, p.144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roland Stärk: ''Darstellende Geometrie'', Schöningh, 1978, {{ISBN|3-506-37443-5}}, p.156.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Choose the images of the coordinate axes, not contained in a line.
#Choose for any coordinate axis forshortenings &lt;math&gt;v_x,v_y,v_z &gt;0 .&lt;/math&gt;
#The image &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt; of a point &lt;math&gt;P=(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the three steps, starting at point &lt;math&gt;\overline O&lt;/math&gt;:
::go &lt;math&gt;v_x\cdot x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\overline x&lt;/math&gt;-direction, then
::go &lt;math&gt;v_y\cdot y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\overline y&lt;/math&gt;-direction, then
::go &lt;math&gt;v_z\cdot z&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\overline z&lt;/math&gt;-direction and 
:4. mark the point as &lt;math&gt;\overline P&lt;/math&gt;.
In order to get undistorted pictures, one has to choose the images of the axes and the forshortenings carefully (see [[Axonometry]]). In order to get an [[orthographic projection]] only the images of the axes are free and the forshortenings are determined. (see [[:de:orthogonale Axonometrie]]).

== Remarks on Schwarz's proof ==
Schwarz formulated and proved the more general statement:
*The vertices of any [[quadrilateral]] can be considered as an oblique parallel projection of the vertices of a [[tetrahedron]] that is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to a given tetrahedron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://math.unipa.it/~grim/quad17_sklenarikova-pemova_07.pdf |first1=Zita |last1=Sklenáriková |first2=Marta |last2=Pémová |title=The Pohlke–Schwarz Theorem and its Relevancy in the Didactics of Mathematics|journal=Quaderni di Ricerca in Didattica|publisher=G.R.I.M. (Department of Mathematics, University of Palermo, Italy)|year=2007|number=17|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and used a theorem of [[Lhuilier|L’Huilier]]: 
*Every triangle can be considered as the orthographic projection of a triangle of a given shape.

[[File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti - Proserpine - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''[[Proserpine (Rossetti painting)|Proserpine]]'', 1874, by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], portrayed by [[Jane Morris]]]]
The '''Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood ''' (later known as the '''Pre-Raphaelites''') was a group of [[England|English]] [[Painting|painter]]s, [[poets]], and [[art critic]]s, founded in 1848 by [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]] and [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]]. The three founders were joined by [[William Michael Rossetti]], [[James Collinson]], [[Frederic George Stephens]] and [[Thomas Woolner]] to form the seven-member "brotherhood". Their principles were shared by other artists, including [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]] and [[Marie Spartali Stillman]].

A later, medievalising strain inspired by Rossetti included [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and extended into the twentieth century with artists such as [[John William Waterhouse]].

The group's intention was to reform art by rejecting what it considered the mechanistic approach first adopted by [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] artists who succeeded [[Raphael]] and [[Michelangelo]]. Its members believed the [[Classicism|Classical]] poses and elegant compositions of Raphael in particular had been a corrupting influence on the [[academic art|academic]] teaching of art, hence the name "Pre-Raphaelite". In particular, the group objected to the influence of [[Sir Joshua Reynolds]], founder of the English [[Royal Academy of Arts]], whom they called "Sir Sloshua". To the Pre-Raphaelites, according to William Michael Rossetti, "sloshy" meant "anything lax or scamped in the process of painting ... and hence ... any thing or person of a commonplace or conventional kind".&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Timothy (1970).  ''The Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 46.  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The brotherhood sought a return to the abundant detail, intense colours and complex compositions of [[Quattrocento]] Italian art. The group associated their work with [[John Ruskin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landow|first1=George P.|title=Pre-Raphaelites: An Introduction|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/prb/1.html|website=The Victorian Web|accessdate=15 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; an English critic whose influences were driven by his religious background.

The group continued to accept the concepts of [[history painting]] and [[mimesis]], imitation of nature, as central to the purpose of art. The Pre-Raphaelites defined themselves as a reform movement, created a distinct name for their form of art, and published a periodical, ''[[The Germ (periodical)|The Germ]]'', to promote their ideas. The group's debates were recorded in the ''Pre-Raphaelite Journal''.

==Beginnings==
[[File:Germ.jpg|thumb|Illustration by Holman Hunt of Thomas Woolner's poem "My Beautiful Lady", published in ''The Germ'', 1850]]
The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was founded in John Millais's parents' house on [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]], London in 1848. At the first meeting, the painters [[John Everett Millais]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], and [[William Holman Hunt]] were present. Hunt and Millais were students at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] and had met in another loose association, the Cyclographic Club, a sketching society. At his own request Rossetti became a pupil of [[Ford Madox Brown]] in 1848.&lt;ref name=McGann&gt;McGann, Jerome J. ''The Complete Writings and Pictures of Dante Gabriel Rossetti'', NINES consortium, Creative Commons License; http://www.rossettiarchive.org/docs/s40.rap.html retrieved 16 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; At that date, Rossetti and Hunt shared lodgings in [[Cleveland Street, London|Cleveland Street]], [[Fitzrovia]], Central London. Hunt had started painting ''The Eve of St. Agnes'' based on [[The Eve of St. Agnes|Keats's poem of the same name]], but it was not completed until 1867.&lt;ref name=hilton28&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

As an aspiring poet, Rossetti wished to develop the links between [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poetry and art. By autumn, four more members, painters [[James Collinson]] and [[Frederic George Stephens]], Rossetti's brother, poet and critic [[William Michael Rossetti]], and  sculptor [[Thomas Woolner]], had joined to form a seven-member-strong brotherhood.&lt;ref name=hilton28/&gt; Ford Madox Brown was invited to join, but the more senior artist remained independent but supported the group throughout the PRB period of Pre-Raphaelitism and contributed to ''The Germ''. Other young painters and sculptors became close associates, including [[Charles Allston Collins]], and [[Alexander Munro (sculptor)|Alexander Munro]]. The PRB intended to keep the existence of the brotherhood secret from members of the Royal Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hisour.com/art-movements/pre-raphaelite-brotherhood-1848-1855/|title=Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood 1848 - 1855 - HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|date=2017-02-22|work=HiSoUR Art Culture Exhibition|access-date=2017-12-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early doctrines==
The brotherhood's early doctrines, as defined by William Michael Rossetti, were expressed in four declarations:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# to have genuine ideas to express;
# to study Nature attentively, so as to know how to express them;
# to sympathise with what is direct and serious and heartfelt in previous art, to the exclusion of what is conventional and self-parading&lt;!-- "parading" NOT "parodying" --&gt; and learned by rote; and
# most indispensable of all, to produce thoroughly good pictures and statues.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Latham, pp. 11-12; see also his comments&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The principles were deliberately non-dogmatic, since the brotherhood wished to emphasise the personal responsibility of individual artists to determine their own ideas and methods of depiction. Influenced by [[Romanticism]], the members thought freedom and responsibility were inseparable. Nevertheless, they were particularly fascinated by [[medieval]] culture, believing it to possess a [[spirituality|spiritual]] and creative integrity that had been lost in later eras. The emphasis on medieval culture clashed with principles of [[realism (arts)|realism]] which stress the independent observation of nature. In its early stages, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood believed its two interests were consistent with one another, but in later years the movement divided and moved in two directions. The realists were led by Hunt and Millais, while the medievalists were led by Rossetti and his followers, [[Edward Burne-Jones]] and [[William Morris]]. The split was never absolute, since both factions believed that art was essentially spiritual in character, opposing their [[idealism]] to the [[materialism|materialist]] realism associated with [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]] and [[Impressionism]].

The Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood was greatly influenced by nature and its members used great detail to show the natural world using bright and sharp focus techniques on a white canvas. In attempts to revive the brilliance of colour found in Quattrocento art, Hunt and Millais developed a technique of painting in thin [[Glaze (painting technique)|glaze]]s of pigment over a wet white ground in the hope that the colours would retain jewel-like transparency and clarity. Their emphasis on brilliance of colour was a reaction to the excessive use of [[bitumen]] by earlier British artists, such as Reynolds, [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]] and [[Benjamin Robert Haydon]]. Bitumen produces unstable areas of muddy darkness, an effect the Pre-Raphaelites despised.

In 1848, Rossetti and Hunt made a list of "Immortals", artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, some of whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings, notably including [[John Keats|Keats]] and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Tennyson]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-pre-raphaelites&lt;/ref&gt;

==First exhibitions and publications==
The first exhibitions of Pre-Raphaelite work occurred in 1849. Both Millais's ''[[Isabella (Millais painting)|Isabella]]'' (1848–1849) and Holman Hunt's ''[[Rienzi vowing to obtain justice for the death of his young brother, slain in a skirmish between the Colonna and the Orsini factions|Rienzi]]'' (1848–1849) were exhibited at the Royal Academy.  Rossetti's ''[[:File:Dante Gabriel Rossetti 004.jpg|Girlhood of Mary Virgin]]'' was shown at a Free Exhibition on Hyde Park Corner. As agreed, all members of the brotherhood signed their work with their name and the initials "PRB". Between January and April 1850, the group published a literary magazine, ''The Germ'' edited by William Rossetti which published poetry by the Rossettis, Woolner, and Collinson and essays on art and literature by associates of the brotherhood, such as [[Coventry Patmore]]. As the short run-time implies, the magazine did not manage to achieve sustained momentum. (Daly 1989)

==Public controversy==
[[File:John Everett Millais - Christ in the House of His Parents (`The Carpenter's Shop') - Google Art Project.jpg|right|thumb|320px|''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'', by John Everett Millais, 1850]]
In 1850, the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood became the subject of controversy after the exhibition of Millais' painting ''[[Christ in the House of His Parents]]'' was considered to be [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] by many reviewers, notably [[Charles Dickens]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Michael (2009). ''Charles Dickens'', p. 309. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Dickens considered Millais' Mary to be ugly.&lt;ref&gt;Andres, Sophia (2005). ''The Pre-Raphaelite Art of the Victorian Novel: Narrative Challenges to Visual Gendered Boundaries'', p. 9. Ohio State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Millais had used his sister-in-law, Mary Hodgkinson, as the model for Mary in his painting. The brotherhood's  medievalism was attacked as backward-looking and its extreme devotion to detail was condemned as ugly and jarring to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;The Times, Saturday, 3 May 1851; pg. 8; Issue 20792: Exhibition of the Royal Academy. (Private View.), First Notice: ''"We cannot censure at present, as amply or as strongly as we desire to do, that strange disorder of the mind or the eyes which continues to rage with unabated absurdity among a class of juvenile artists who style themselves "P.R.B.," which being interpreted means ''Pre-Raphael Brethren''. Their faith seems to consist in an absolute contempt for perspective and the known laws of light and shade, an aversion to beauty in every shape, and a singular devotion to the minute accidents of their subjects, including, or rather seeking out, every excess of sharpness and deformity."''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dickens, Millais made the Holy Family look like alcoholics and slum-dwellers, adopting contorted and absurd "medieval" poses. A rival group of older artists, [[The Clique]], used its influence against the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and its principles were publicly attacked by the President of the Academy, Sir [[Charles Lock Eastlake]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

After the controversy, Collinson left the brotherhood and the remaining members met to discuss whether he should be replaced by Charles Allston Collins or [[Walter Howell Deverell]], but were unable to make a decision. From that point the group disbanded, though its influence continued. Artists who had worked in the style initially continued but no longer signed works "PRB".{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

[[File:John Everett Millais - Ophelia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Ophelia (painting)|Ophelia]]'', by [[John Everett Millais]]]]
The brotherhood found support from the critic [[John Ruskin]], who praised its devotion to nature and rejection of conventional methods of composition. The Pre-Raphaelites were influenced by Ruskin's theories. He wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' defending their work and subsequently met them. Initially, he favoured Millais, who travelled to Scotland in the summer of 1853 with Ruskin and Ruskin's wife, Euphemia Chalmers Ruskin, née Gray (now best known as [[Effie Gray]]). The main object of the journey was to paint Ruskin's portrait.&lt;ref&gt;Dearden, James S. (1999). ''John Ruskin: A Life in Pictures'', pp. 36–37. Sheffield Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Effie became increasingly attached to Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Rose, ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'', 1983, pp. 49–94.&lt;/ref&gt; creating a crisis. In subsequent annulment proceedings, Ruskin himself made a statement to his lawyer to the effect that his marriage had been unconsummated.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage was annulled on grounds of non-[[consummation]], leaving Effie free to marry Millais,&lt;ref&gt;Dearden (1999), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; but causing a public scandal. Millais began to move away from the Pre-Raphaelite style after his marriage, and Ruskin ultimately attacked his later works. Ruskin continued to support Hunt and Rossetti and provided funds to encourage the art of Rossetti's wife [[Elizabeth Siddall]].

By 1853 the original PRB had virtually dissolved,&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Michael |title=The concise Oxford dictionary of art terms - Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood |year=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |isbn=9780199569922}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only Holman Hunt remaining true to its stated aims. But the term "Pre-Raphaelite" stuck to Rossetti and others, including [[William Morris]] and [[Edward Burne-Jones]], with whom he became involved in [[Oxford]] in 1857.&lt;ref name="Whiteley"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whiteley |first=Jon |title=Oxford and the Pre-Raphaelites |year=1989 |publisher=Ashmolean Museum |location=Oxford |isbn=0907849946}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence the term Pre-Raphaelite is associated with the much wider and long-lived art movement, including the dreamy, yearning images of women produced by Rossetti and several of his followers.

==Later developments and influence==
[[File:De Morgan Medea.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Medea]]'' by Evelyn De Morgan, 1889, in [[quattrocento]] style]]
Artists influenced by the brotherhood include [[John Brett (artist)|John Brett]], [[Philip Calderon]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Gustave Moreau]], [[Evelyn De Morgan]],&lt;ref name=hilton202&gt;Hilton (1970), pp. 202–05&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic Sandys]] (who entered the Pre-Raphaelite circle in 1857)&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt; and [[John William Waterhouse]]. [[Ford Madox Brown]], who was associated with them from the beginning, is often seen as most closely adopting the Pre-Raphaelite principles. One follower who developed his own distinct style was [[Aubrey Beardsley]], who was pre-eminently influenced by Burne-Jones.&lt;ref name=hilton202/&gt;

After 1856, Dante Gabriel Rossetti became an inspiration for the medievalising strand of the movement. He was the link between the two types of Pre-Raphaelite painting (nature and Romance) after the PRB became lost in the later decades of the century. Rossetti, although the least committed to the brotherhood, continued the name and changed its style. He began painting versions of femme fatales using models like [[Jane Morris]], in paintings such as ''Proserpine'', ''The Blue Silk Dress'', and ''La Pia de' Tolomei''. His work influenced his friend [[William Morris]], in whose firm [[Morris &amp; Co.|Morris, Marshall, Faulkner &amp; Co.]] he became a partner, and with whose wife Jane he may have had an affair. Ford Madox Brown and Edward Burne-Jones also became partners in the firm. Through Morris's company, the ideals of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood influenced many interior designers and architects, arousing interest in [[medieval]] designs and other crafts leading to the [[Arts and Crafts movement]] headed by William Morris. Holman Hunt was involved with the movement to reform design through the [[Della Robbia Pottery]] company.

After 1850, Hunt and Millais moved away from direct imitation of medieval art. They stressed the realist and scientific aspects of the movement, though Hunt continued to emphasise the spiritual significance of art, seeking to reconcile religion and science by making accurate observations and studies of locations in [[Egypt]] and [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] for his paintings on biblical subjects. In contrast, Millais abandoned Pre-Raphaelitism after 1860, adopting a much broader and looser style influenced by Reynolds. William Morris and others condemned his reversal of principles.

[[File:The Death of King Arthur by James Archer (1860).jpg|thumb|left|James Archer, ''The Death of King Arthur'', 1860]]
Pre-Raphaelitism had a significant impact in Scotland and on Scottish artists. The figure in Scottish art most associated with the Pre-Raphaelites was the Aberdeen-born [[William Dyce]] (1806–64). Dyce befriended the young Pre-Raphaelites in London and introduced their work to Ruskin.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 348.&lt;/ref&gt; His later work was Pre-Raphaelite in its spirituality, as can be seen in his ''The Man of Sorrows'' and ''David in the Wilderness'' (both 1860), which contain a Pre-Raphaelite attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;M. MacDonald, ''Scottish Art'' (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Noel Paton]] (1821-1901) studied at the Royal Academy schools in London, where he became a friend of Millais and he subsequently followed him into Pre-Raphaelitism, producing pictures that stressed detail and melodrama such as ''The Bludie Tryst'' (1855). His later paintings, like those of Millais, have been criticised for descending into popular sentimentality.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;D. Macmillan, ''Scottish Art 1460-1990'' (Edinburgh: Mainstream, 1990), {{ISBN|0500203334}}, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Also influenced by Millais was [[James Archer (artist)|James Archer]] (1823-1904) and whose work includes ''Summertime, Gloucestershire'' (1860)&lt;ref name="Macmillan" /&gt; and who from 1861 began a series of [[Arthurian]]-based paintings including ''La Morte d'Arthur'' and ''Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere''.&lt;ref&gt;R. Barber, ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief'' (Harvard University Press, 2004), {{ISBN|0674013905}}, p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Raphaelism also inspired painters like [[Lawrence Alma-Tadema]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fineartbookstore.com/s-120-Pre-Raphaelites|title=Fine Art Books Art Instruction {{!}} Photography Books {{!}} Visual Arts Periods, Groups &amp; Movements: Pre-Raphaelites|last=|first=|date=|website=fineartbookstore.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement influenced many later British artists into the 20th century. Rossetti came to be seen as a precursor of the wider European [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] movement. In the late 20th century the [[Brotherhood of Ruralists]] based its aims on Pre-Raphaelitism, while the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] and the [[Birmingham Group (artists)|Birmingham Group]] have also derived inspiration from it.

[[Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery]] has a world-renowned collection of works by Burne-Jones and the Pre-Raphaelites that, some claim, strongly influenced the young [[J. R. R. Tolkien]],&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Bucher (2004) for a brief discussion on the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites on Tolkien.&lt;/ref&gt; who wrote ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', with influences taken from the same mythological scenes portrayed by the Pre-Raphaelites.
[[File:Arthur Hughes - Fair Rosamund - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|[[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], ''Fair Rosamund'', 1854]]
In the 20th century artistic ideals changed, and art moved away from representing reality. Since the Pre-Raphaelites were fixed on portraying things with near-photographic precision, though with a distinctive attention to detailed surface-patterns, their work was devalued by many painters and critics. After the [[First World War]], British [[Modernism|Modernists]] associated Pre-Raphaelite art with the repressive and backward times in which they grew up. In the 1960s there was a major revival of Pre-Raphaelitism. Exhibitions and catalogues of works, culminating in a 1984 exhibition in London's [[Tate Gallery]], re-established a canon of Pre-Raphaelite work.&lt;ref&gt;Barringer, Tim (1999). ''Reading the Pre-Raphaelites'', p. 17. Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Among many other exhibitions, there was another large show at [[Tate Britain]] in 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/pre-raphaelites-victorian-avant-garde ''Pre-Raphaelites: Victorian Avant-Garde''], Tate Britain, accessed 27 August 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illustration and poetry==
Many members of the ‘inner’ Pre-Raphaelite circle ([[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[John Everett Millais]], [[William Holman Hunt]], [[Ford Madox Brown]], [[Edward Burne-Jones]]) and ‘outer’ circle ([[Frederick Sandys]], [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], [[Simeon Solomon]], [[Henry Hugh Armstead]], [[Joseph Noel Paton]], [[Frederic Shields]], [[Matthew James Lawless]]) were working concurrently in painting, illustration, and sometimes poetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Victorian Illustration: The Pre-Raphaelites, the Idyllic School and the High Victorians|last=Goldman|first=Paul|publisher=Lund Humphries|year=2004|isbn=|location=Burlington, VT|pages=1–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian morality judged literature as superior to painting, because of its “noble grounds for noble emotion.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|last=Welland|first=Dennis S. R.|publisher=George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd.|year=1953|isbn=|location=London, UK|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]] (a writer and opponent of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) felt so strongly about this artistic hierarchy that he wrote: “The truth is that literature, and more particularly poetry, is in a very bad way when one art gets hold of another, and imposes upon it its conditions and limitations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=Robert W.|date=October 1871|title=The Fleshly School of Poetry: Mr. D.G. Rossetti|url=|journal=The Contemporary Review|volume=|pages=|via=}} as cited in Welland, D.S.R. The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art. London, UK: George G. Harrap &amp; Co. Ltd., 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the hostile environment in which Pre-Raphaelites were defiantly working in various media. The Pre-Raphaelites attempted to revitalize [[subject painting]], which had been dismissed as artificial. Their belief that each picture should tell a story was an important step for the unification of painting and literature (eventually deemed the [[Sister Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/atheories/1.1.html|title=Chapter One: Ruskin's Theories of the Sister Arts — Ut Pictura Poesis|website=www.victorianweb.org|access-date=2017-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;), or at least a break in the rigid hierarchy promoted by writers like Robert Buchanan.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Letter from D.G. Rossetti to William Allingham|last=Rossetti|first=Dante Gabriel|work=The Pre-Raphaelites in Literature and Art|publisher=|year=1855|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pre-Raphaelite desire for more extensive affiliation between painting and literature also manifested in illustration. Illustration is a more direct unification of these media and, like subject painting, can assert a narrative of its own. For the Pre-Raphaelites, and Dante Gabriel Rossetti specifically, there was anxiety about the constraints of illustration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1855, Rossetti wrote to [[William Allingham]] about the independence of illustration: “I have not begun even designing for them yet, but fancy I shall try the ‘Vision of Sin’ and ‘Palace of Art’ etc. – those where one can allegorize on one’s own hook, without killing for oneself and everyone a distinct idea of the poet’s."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This passage makes apparent Rossetti’s desire to not just support the poet’s narrative, but to create an allegorical illustration that functions separately from the text as well. In this respect, Pre-Raphaelite illustrations go beyond depicting an episode from a poem, but rather function like subject paintings within a text.

==Collections==
[[File:William Holman Hunt 001.jpg|thumb|right|320px|[[William Holman Hunt]], ''[[The Hireling Shepherd]]'', 1851]]
There are major collections of Pre-Raphaelite work in United Kingdom museums such as the [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], the [[Tate Gallery]], [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], [[Manchester Art Gallery]], [[Lady Lever Art Gallery]], and Liverpool's [[Walker Art Gallery]]. The [[Art Gallery of South Australia]] and the [[Delaware Art Museum]] in the US have the most significant collections of Pre-Raphaelite art outside the UK. The [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]] in Puerto Rico also has a notable collection of Pre-Raphaelite works, including Sir Edward Burne-Jones' ''[[The Last Sleep of Arthur in Avalon]]'', [[Frederic Lord Leighton]]'s ''[[Flaming June]]'', and works by William Holman Hunt, John Everett Millais, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, and [[Frederic Sandys]].

There is a set of Pre-Raphaelite murals in the Old Library at the [[Oxford Union]], depicting scenes from the [[Arthurian legend]]s, painted between 1857 and 1859 by a team of Dante Gabriel Rossetti, William Morris, and Edward Burne-Jones.  The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] houses at [[Wightwick Manor]], [[Wolverhampton]], and at [[Wallington Hall]], [[Northumberland]], both have significant and representative collections. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] is an avid collector of Pre-Raphaelite works, and a selection of 300 items from his collection were shown at an exhibition at the [[Royal Academy]] in London in 2003.

[[Kelmscott Manor]], the country home of [[William Morris]] from 1871 until his death in 1896, is owned by the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] and is open to the public. The Manor is featured in Morris' work ''[[News from Nowhere]]''. It also appears in the background of [[Water Willow (Rossetti)|''Water Willow'']], a portrait of his wife, [[Jane Morris]], painted by [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] in 1871.  There are exhibitions connected with Morris and Rossetti’s early experiments with photography.

==Portrayal in popular culture==
The story of the brotherhood, from its controversial first exhibition to being embraced by the art establishment, has been depicted in two [[BBC]] television series. The first, ''[[The Love School]]'', was broadcast in 1975; the second is the 2009 BBC television drama serial ''[[Desperate Romantics]]'' by [[Peter Bowker]]. Although much of the latter's material is derived from [[Franny Moyle]]'s factual book ''Desperate Romantics: The Private Lives of the Pre-Raphaelites'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/06_june/25/romantics.shtml Desperate Romantics press pack: introduction] ''BBC Press Office''. Retrieved on 24 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the series occasionally departs from established facts in favour of dramatic licence and is prefaced by the disclaimer: "In the mid-19th century, a group of young men challenged the art establishment of the day. The pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood were inspired by the real world around them, yet took imaginative licence in their art. This story, based on their lives and loves, follows in that inventive spirit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC2 drama on icons among Pre-Raphaelites |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article6626470.ece|author=Armstrong, Stephen|work=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=5 July 2009 |accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Russell]]'s television film ''[[Dante's Inferno (1967 TV film)|Dante's Inferno]]'' (1967) contains brief scenes on some of the leading Pre-Raphaelites but mainly concentrates on the life of Rossetti, played by [[Oliver Reed]].

==Plot==
Seventeen-year-old Joshua "Josh" McGuire ([[Rhys Wakefield]]), expedition bank-roller Carl Hurley ([[Ioan Gruffudd]]) and his girlfriend, Victoria "Vic" Elaine (Alice Parkinson), travel to the Esa'ala Cave, an underwater [[Cave diving|cave exploration]] site in [[Papua New Guinea]]. Josh's father, Frank ([[Richard Roxburgh]]), a master diver, has already established a forward base camp at a lower level inside the cave, where the team has been exploring for weeks. As Josh voices his disdain for his father and his opinions about cave exploration, the team below prepares to dive into an unexplored area of the system.

While exploring the entrance to the new system, Judes ([[Allison Cratchley]]) experiences a problem with her air tank hose. She loses use of her air mask forcing Frank to [[Buddy breathing|buddy breathe]]. After a few exchanges, Judes panics and tries to keep the mask on, but Frank forces the mask off of her knowing he will not have enough air otherwise to make it back to the team. As Judes drowns, Josh watches on a monitor at "forward camp" and presumes the worst of his father. In a struggle to determine who truly was responsible for her death, it is revealed by Frank that Judes had dived in an exhausted state since they previously had to retrieve the extra bailout tanks, a task Josh didn't do. Meanwhile, their above-ground crew realizes that a very big storm is preparing to hit their location sooner than anticipated. They attempt to warn the team below, but are unsuccessful. Josh expresses his desire to return to the surface and with communications down and an uncertain expedition in front of them, team leader Frank agrees to have his son return to the surface with a buddy climber ahead of them.

While Josh climbs back towards the surface with Luko, Liz, and J.D, water begins rushing in from their exit. The storm they were trying to avoid had turned into a [[cyclone]] causing flash floods that begin to fill the cave. As J.D. and Liz make their way up through "the elevator" (an area leading up to the main entrance of the cave), Josh is unable to leave his father and the dive team behind to their doom and turns back, accompanied by Luko. As they are making their way back to "forward camp" they discover that Frank and the team have already evacuated their camp and are assisting Victoria as she climbs her way up and out of the cavern. Josh leaps in to help, strapping a rope around a nearby boulder and forming a belay for the team to escape.  Unfortunately, the boulder begins to give way leaving Josh to hold Victoria's line and Luko to hold back the boulder. The water rushes through and forces Victoria and Josh to fall back down into the now flooded base camp. Luko is severely injured when the boulder breaks loose, sealing the shaft and throwing him back down into the cavern. He is swept into an underwater tunnel before the team can reach him. 

The team decides to use the unexplored tunnel as an escape route from the rapidly flooding cavern. Victoria, panicked and anxious, refuses to wear Jude's old wetsuit and is given a quick tutorial on how to dive. Before the team can leave, a severely injured and mutilated Luko surfaces in the cavern. Seeing that his friend is in great pain and near death, Frank mercifully [[Euthanasia|drowns him]].
The team presses on and makes it through to the other side of the system. Without a wetsuit, Victoria suffers severely from the cold water. Meanwhile, George - an experienced, veteran diver - has become [[Decompression sickness|ill]] due to the dive and is dying unbeknownst to the rest of the team. After a short rest, the team continues through the system following the flow of water out towards the sea. George realizes that he cannot continue and after sharing a few words with Josh relieves himself of his pack and hides himself so as not to burden the rest of the team.

As the team marches on they arrive at a seemingly dead end. A great hole in the bottom of the cave separates them from the other side of their path. Josh uses his climbing expertise to fish a line across and begins to transfer their gear and each other. As Victoria begins to make her way across she catches her hair in her rope gear she is hung on and loses her grip, leaving her hair as the only thing holding her weight. Using her knife, she attempts to cut away the hair, but severs her rope and falls to her death. At the sight of Victoria's death, Carl becomes psychotic. In a fit of panic, he steals the last remaining rebreather and disappears into the tunnel. Josh and Frank, however, find another way out through a crevasse in the cavern. The tunnel leads them to a sunlit cavern where an unidentified WWII [[Japanese tanks of World War II|Japanese tank]] collapsed through the surface years ago. Unfortunately the hole in the middle of the roof where the tank fell is the only opening and they are unable to climb out. They spend the rest of the day there and proceed back into the cave by night.

A little later they discover Carl who has gone completely insane and found Victoria's corpse. Carl attempts to murder Frank but Josh separates the two and temporarily disables Carl. Frank, however, has been gravely injured having fallen on a [[stalagmite]] which punctured his back. When Carl wakes, the gravity of his actions is realized and he solemnly disappears into the tunnel. In immense pain, Frank requests that Josh drown him. Josh reluctantly does so, and swims into the tunnel. 
A short distance in, he encounters Carl, who has already drowned looking for the exit. 
Just as he begins to lose hope, Josh discovers a way out through the cave to open ocean. He emerges from the water and crawls onto the beach, where he is discovered by fishermen.

==Production==
''Sanctum'' was inspired by the film's co-writer [[Andrew Wight]]'s experience with a 1988 [[cave diving]] expedition in Australia that resulted in 13 cavers becoming trapped in one of the world's largest underwater cave systems in [[Nullarbor Plain]] after a freak storm collapsed the entrance.&lt;ref name="13_Hauled_To_Safety_From_Cave"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cavediving.com.au/cave-diving-articles/1988/12/4/13-hauled-to-safety-from-cave/|title=Cave Diving|work=Melbourne Sun Herald|accessdate=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; That incident was documented in the film ''Nullarbor Dreaming''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wright|first=Andrew|title=Nullarbor dreaming : a real life adventure|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/34972528?q&amp;versionId=43409367|accessdate=28 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Cameron]] served as executive producer for ''Sanctum''.&lt;ref name="production_notes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visualhollywood.com/movies_2011/sanctum/about.php|title=Sanctum (2011) – About the Production|publisher=Visual Hollywood|accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the film's plot takes place in Esa'ala Cave, most of the film was shot in [[Australia]] ([[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Queensland]]). Sanctum employs 3D photography techniques Cameron developed to film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''. All of the underwater sequences took place in a large water tank at the [[Warner Roadshow Studios|Village Roadshow Studios]] in Queensland. Real caves were also filmed in South Australia's cave-diving region around [[Mount Gambier, South Australia|Mount Gambier]].&lt;ref name="production_notes"/&gt; Stunt diver [[Agnes Milowka]], who appears as a double in the already-released film, drowned in one of these caves on 27 February 2011 when she reportedly ran out of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/victorian-cave-diver-agnes-milowka-dies-at-tank-cave-mt-gambier/story-e6frf7kx-1226013313425 |title=Victorian cave diver Agnes Milowka dies at Tank Cave, Mt Gambier |author=Katherine Firkin, Matt Schulz |publisher=Heraldsun.com.au |date=2011-02-28 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In striking similarities to the movie script, she also left her spare tank behind, to force the way through the tight restriction, and it is actually her playing Judes' drowning scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=8254266 |title=In Too Deep |author=Nick Greenaway, [[Allison Langdon]] | publisher=60 Minutes, [[Nine Network]] Australia |date=2011-05-29 |accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Universal Studios]] and [[Relativity Media]] paid $12&amp;nbsp;million for rights to distribute the film in the United States and Canada, and in several foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2011/02/movie-projector-the-roommate-and-sanctum-wont-score-on-superbowl-weekend.html|title=Movie Projector: 'The Roommate' and 'Sanctum' won't score on Super Bowl weekend|last=Fritz|first=Ben|last2=Kaufman|first2=Amy|work=Los Angeles Times |publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=2011-02-03|accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
The film received predominantly negative reviews in the US. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 30% of 161 critics rated the film positively with an average score of 4.5/10. The consensus states that "''Sanctum'' is beautifully photographed, and it makes better use of 3-D technology than most, but that doesn't make up for its ham-handed script and lifeless cast." It has a [[Metacritic]] rating of 42 out of 100. However, in the rest of the world, where the major part of the gross take occurred,&lt;ref name="BOM"/&gt; some reviews were slightly better. In Australia, Jim Schembri gave it 3 1/2 stars from 5&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/movies/sanctum-3d-20110202-1ad7u.html |title=Sanctum 3D |author= Jim Schembri |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=2011-02-03|accessdate=2011-08-22 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the UK's ''Daily Express'' gave it 3 from 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/226923/Sanctum-film-reviewSanctum-film-reviewSanctum-film-review |title=Sanctum film review |publisher=Express.co.uk |date=2011-02-04 |accessdate=2011-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''seventh son of a seventh son''' is a concept from [[folklore]] regarding special powers given to, or held by, such a son. The seventh son must come from an unbroken line with no female siblings born between and, in turn, be born to such a seventh son.&lt;ref&gt;Ten Thousand Wonderful Things, Edmund Fillingham King, p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; The number {{num|seven}} has a long history of [[7 (number)#In mythology|mystical]] and [[7 (number)#relious|biblical]] significance: [[seven virtues]], [[seven deadly sins]], [[Seven Sleepers]], [[Genesis creation narrative|seven days of creation]], etc. In this case, it refers to a man who is the seventh son of a man who is himself a seventh son.

In some beliefs, the special powers are inborn, inherited simply by virtue of his birth order; in others the powers are granted to him by God or the gods because of his birth order.

==Regional variations==

===Ireland===
The seventh son of a seventh son is gifted as a healer. The seventh son of a seventh son is part of a more general phenomenon known as the "cure" (sometimes also called the "charm").&lt;ref&gt;See A D Buckley 1980 'Unofficial healing in Ulster.' ''Ulster Folklife'' 26, 15–34&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S.===
According to [[Edward Augustus Kendall|Kendall's]] ''Travels through the Northern Parts of the United States, in the year 1807–1808'' while visiting the [[Old Newgate Prison|Newgate copper mine and prison]], the author met an innkeep who told him that "there was to be found in [[Talcott Mountain|the surrounding hills]], a black stone, of a certain species, through which a seventh son of a seventh son, born in the month of February, with a [[Caul#Types|caul]] on his head, can discern everything that lies in the depths and interior of the globe." The author speculates that the importance of mining to the community gave rise to this localized belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holcombegenealogy.com/data/p877.htm |title=Thomas Holcombe of Connecticut - Person Page 877 |publisher=Holcombegenealogy.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Denis Larionov &amp; Alexander Zhulin |url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/edward-augustus-kendall/travels-through-the-northern-parts-of-the-united-states-in-the-year-1807-and-18-ala/page-12-travels-through-the-northern-parts-of-the-united-states-in-the-year-1807-and-18-ala.shtml |title=Travels through the northern parts of the United States, in the year 1807 and 1808 (Volume 2) by Edward Augustus Kendall |page=12 |publisher=Ebooksread.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American author [[Jackson Pearce]] uses the folklore around seventh sons in her novel ''Sisters Red'', in which potential werewolves are seventh sons of seventh sons.&lt;ref&gt;''Werewolves and Other Shapeshifters in Popular Culture'' by Kimberley McMahon-Coleman and Roslyn Weaver, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin America===
It is believed that he will be a [[werewolf]], ''lobizón'' or ''lobisomem'' (the word in Portuguese language that means "werewolf"). To stop the curse the newborn should be baptized in seven different churches, or be baptized by the name of ''Benito'' while the eldest son is his godfather. It is important to note that the local myth of the ''lobizón'' is not connected to the custom that began over 100 years ago by which every seventh son (or seventh daughter) born in Argentina becomes godchild to the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/29/argentina-kirchner-adopt-child-werewolf |title=No, Argentina's president did not adopt a Jewish child to stop him turning into a werewolf |date= |accessdate=2015-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
"Ciarallo" was the seventh son who had the power to enchant and recall snakes, and who was immune to snake venom. It wasn't enough to be a seventh son but was needed a special initiation rite called "inciaramazione". Recourse was made to Ciarallo when a snake sneaked into the house and it is said that the reptile was promptly attracted by the sound of his whistle. Another social task of Ciarallo was "inciaramare" other people by spreading a special oil, complete with a special recipe, on the arm of those who requested the treatment to ensure protection from snakes bites. Children were led to Ciarallo by their mothers to get protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monteneronline.it/arte/tradizioni.htm |title=TRADIZIONI E MITI POPOLARI |date= |accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This causes problems as females are supposed to be witches, and males wizards, due to each gender having a different method of thinking, and the powers associated with each title are not interchangeable.

'''Sylvia Beach''' (March 14, 1887 – October 5, 1962), born '''Nancy Woodbridge Beach''', was an American-born bookseller and  publisher who lived most of her life in [[Paris]], where she was one of the leading [[expatriate]] figures between [[World War I]] and [[World War II|II]].{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}

She is known for her Paris bookstore, [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]], where she published [[James Joyce]]'s controversial book, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922), and encouraged the publication and sold copies of Hemingway's first book, ''[[Three Stories and Ten Poems]]'' (1923).

==Early life==
Beach was born in her father's [[parsonage]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], United States, on March 14, 1887, the second of three daughters of Sylvester Beach and Eleanor Thomazine Orbison. She had an older sister, Holly, and a younger sister, Cyprian.&lt;ref&gt;1900 United States Federal Census&lt;/ref&gt; Although named Nancy after her grandmother Orbison, she later decided to change her name to Sylvia.  Her maternal grandparents were missionaries to India, and her father, a Presbyterian minister, was descended from several generations of clergymen.  When the girls were young the family lived in Baltimore and in [[Bridgeton, New Jersey]]. Then in 1901, the family moved to France upon Sylvester Beach's appointment as assistant minister of the [[American Church in Paris]] and director of the American student center.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

Beach spent the years 1902-1905 in Paris, returning to New Jersey in 1906 when her father became minister of the First Presbyterian Church of Princeton.  Beach made several return trips to Europe, lived for two years in Spain, and worked for the Balkan Commission of the Red Cross.  During the last years of the Great War, she was drawn back to Paris to study contemporary French literature.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

==Shakespeare and Company==

While conducting some research at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque Nationale]], Beach found the name of a lending library and bookshop, ''La Maison des Amis des Livres''&lt;ref&gt;"The House of the Friends of Books"&lt;/ref&gt; at 7 [[rue de l'Odéon]], [[6th arrondissement of Paris|Paris VI]], in a French literary journal.{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=12-13}} There she was warmly welcomed by the owner who, to her surprise, was a plump fair-haired young woman, [[Adrienne Monnier]]. Monnier was wearing a garment that looked like a cross between a peasant’s dress and a nun’s habit, "with a long full skirt … and a sort of tight-fitting velvet waistcoat over a white [[silk blouse]]. She was in gray and white like her bookshop."{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=12-13}} Although Beach was dressed in a Spanish cloak and hat, Monnier knew immediately that she was American.  At that first meeting Monnier declared, "I like America very much".{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=12-13}} Beach replied that she liked France very much. They later became lovers and lived together for 36 years&lt;ref name=andre/&gt; until Monnier’s suicide in 1955.

Beach immediately became a member of Monnier’s lending library, and when in Paris she regularly attended the readings by authors such as [[André Gide]],  [[Paul Valéry]] and [[Jules Romains]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} Inspired by the literary life of the [[Left Bank]] and by Monnier’s efforts to promote innovative writing, Beach dreamed of starting a branch of Monnier’s book shop in New York that would offer contemporary French works to American readers.  Since her only capital was US$3,000 which her mother gave her from her savings, Beach could not afford such a venture in New York.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}} However, Paris rents were much cheaper and the exchange rates favorable, so with Monnier’s help, Beach opened an English language bookstore and lending library that she named [[Shakespeare and Company (bookstore)|Shakespeare and Company]]. Four years beforehand, Monnier had been among the first women in France to found her own bookstore. Beach's bookstore was located at 8 rue Dupuytren, Paris VI.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

[[File:Paris Rue de l Odeon 12 plaque retouched.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque, at 12 Rue Odéon, Paris VI mentioning that " In July 1920, Beach met Irish writer [[James Joyce]] at a dinner party hosted by French poet [[André Spire]]. Soon after, Joyce joined Beach's lending library.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, "When Paris Sizzled," p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce had been trying, unsuccessfully, to publish his manuscript for his masterpiece, ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulyssess]]'' and Beach, seeing his frustration, offered to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;McAuliffe, 'When Paris Sizzled," p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922 Sylvia Beach published James Joyce's Ulysses in this apartment."]]
Shakespeare and Company quickly attracted both French and American readers - including a number of aspiring writers to whom Beach offered hospitality and encouragement as well as books.  As the [[franc]] dropped in value and the favorable exchange rate attracted a huge influx of Americans, Beach’s shop flourished and soon needed more space.  In May 1921, Shakespeare and Company moved to 12 [[rue de l'Odéon]], just across the street from Monnier’s ''Maison des Amis des Livres''.  Shakespeare and Company gained considerable fame after it published [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in 1922, as a result of Joyce's inability to get an edition out in English-speaking countries.{{sfnp|Fitch|1983|pp=12-13}}{{sfnp|Griffin|1992|p=3}} Beach would later be financially stranded when Joyce signed on with another publisher, leaving Beach in debt after bankrolling, and suffering severe losses from, the publication of ''Ulysses''.{{sfnp|Garner|2010|}}{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}

Shakespeare and Company experienced difficulty throughout the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, but remained supported by wealthy friends, including [[Bryher (novelist)|Bryher]].  In 1936 when Beach thought that she would be forced to close her shop, André Gide organized a group of writers into a club called Friends of Shakespeare and Company.  Subscribers paid 200 francs a year to attend readings at Shakespeare and Company.  Although subscriptions were limited to a select group of 200 people (the maximum number the store could accommodate), the renown of the French and American authors participating in readings during those two years attracted considerable attention to the store.  Beach recalled that by then, "we were so glorious with all these famous writers and all the press we received that we began to do very well in business".{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp = 210-211}} [[Violette Leduc]] describes meeting her and the ambiance of the shop in her autobiography ''La Bâtarde''.{{sfnp|Leduc|Coltman|2003|p=TBA}} Shakespeare and Company remained open after the [[Fall of Paris#A new German offensive and the fall of Paris|Fall of Paris]], but by the end of 1941, Beach was forced to close.{{sfnp|Glass|2009|pp = 24–27}}
She was interned for six months during [[World War II]] at [[Vittel]] until [[Tudor Wilkinson]] managed to secure her release in February 1942. Beach kept her books hidden in a vacant apartment upstairs at 12 rue de l'Odeon. [[Ernest Hemingway]] symbolically "liberated" the shop in person in 1944,{{sfnp|Beach|1991|pp=219-220}} but it never re-opened for business.

In 1956, Beach wrote ''Shakespeare and Company'', a memoir of the inter-war years that details the cultural life of Paris at the time.  The book contains first-hand observations of [[James Joyce]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Ezra Pound]], [[T. S. Eliot]], [[Valery Larbaud]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[André Gide]], [[Leon-Paul Fargue]], [[George Antheil]], [[Robert McAlmon]], [[Gertrude Stein]], [[Stephen Benet]], [[Aleister Crowley]], [[Harry Crosby]], [[Mary Phelps Jacob|Caresse Crosby]], [[John Quinn (collector)|John Quinn]], [[Berenice Abbott]], [[Man Ray]], and many others.

After Monnier's suicide in 1955, Beach had a relationship with [[Camilla Steinbrugge]].{{sfnp|Monnier|McDougall|1996| p=529}}&lt;ref name=andre/&gt; Although Beach's income was modest during the last years of her life, she was widely honored for her publication of ''Ulysses'' and her support of aspiring writers during the 1920s. She remained in Paris until her death in 1962, and was buried in [[Princeton Cemetery]]. Her papers are archived at [[Princeton University]].&lt;ref name=andre&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biob2/beac2.html|title=Sylvia Beach|date=May 4, 2003|accessdate=2010-03-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820084635/http://andrejkoymasky.com/liv/fam/biob2/beac2.html|archivedate=August 20, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American [[George Whitman]] opened a new bookshop in 1951 at a different location in Paris (in the [[rue de la Bûcherie]]) originally called ''Le Mistral'', but renamed Shakespeare and Company in 1964 in honor of the late Sylvia Beach.{{sfnp|Sharkey|2002|}} Since his death in 2011, it has been run by his daughter [[Sylvia Beach Whitman]], named after Beach.{{sfnp|Lennan|2014}}

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s '''Symphony No. 1''' in [[C major]], [[Opus number|Op.]] 21, was dedicated to Baron [[Gottfried van Swieten]], an early patron of the composer. The piece was published in 1801 by [[Franz Anton Hoffmeister|Hoffmeister &amp; Kühnel]] of Leipzig. It is not known exactly when Beethoven finished writing this work, but sketches of the finale were found to be from 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beethoven and his Nine Symphonies |last=Grove |first=George |year=1896 |publisher=Novello and Company, Limited |location=London |pages=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
The [[symphony]] is clearly indebted to Beethoven's predecessors, particularly his teacher [[Joseph Haydn]] as well as [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], but nonetheless has characteristics that mark it uniquely as Beethoven's work, notably the frequent use of ''[[Dynamics (music)#Sudden changes|sforzandi]]'' and the prominent, more independent use of wind instruments. Sketches for the finale are found among the exercises Beethoven wrote while studying [[counterpoint]] under [[Johann Georg Albrechtsberger]] in the spring of 1797.

The premiere took place on 2 April 1800 at the [[Burgtheater#History|K.K. Hoftheater nächst der Burg]] in Vienna. Most sources agree that the concert program also included Beethoven's [[Septet (Beethoven)|Septet]] as well as a symphony by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], but there is some disagreement as to whether the remainder of the program included excerpts from Haydn's oratorio ''[[The Creation (Haydn)|The Creation]]'' or from ''[[The Seasons (Haydn)|The Seasons]]'' and whether Beethoven's own [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Beethoven)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] or [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Beethoven)|No. 2]] was performed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/593218/Beethovens_Symphony_No._1_in_C_Major_Op._21_Historical_Theoretical_and_Performance_Interpretations Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 in C Major, Op. 21: Historical, Theoretical and Performance Interpretations] Nicholas Alexander Brown, Brandeis University, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.classiccat.net/beethoven_l_van/21.info.php Beethoven opus 21 Symphony No. 1 in C Major] classiccat.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classical-music.com/article/beethoven-what-did-19th-century-think Beethoven: What did the 19th century think?] Barry Cooper, classical-music.com, October 27 2015&lt;/ref&gt; This concert effectively served to announce Beethoven's talents to Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Edmund. ''Beethoven The Universal Composer''. New York: HarperCollins, 2005, pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for the following instrumentation
{{col-begin}}
{{col-break}}
;[[Woodwind]]:

:2 [[Flute]]s
:2 [[Oboe]]s
:2 [[Clarinet]]s in C
:2 [[Bassoon]]s
{{col-break}}

;[[Brass]]:

;[[String instrument|Strings]]:

{{col-end}}

The clarinet parts are commonly played on B{{music|flat}} clarinet, as C and D clarinets are no longer widely used. However, there is some controversy over whether they should be played on E{{music|flat}} instruments instead. The E{{music|flat}} clarinet's timbre is much closer to that of the C and D clarinets than that of the warmer-sounding B{{music|flat}} clarinet.&lt;ref&gt;Del Mar, Norman. "Anatomy of the Orchestra". University of California Press, 1987, p. 146-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The second flute is not used in the second movement.

==Description and analysis==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
The beginning of the twelve-[[Bar (music)|bar]] ''introduction'' of the first movement is sometimes considered a "musical joke". For example, the English musicologist [[Donald Tovey]] has called this work "a comedy of manners".&lt;ref&gt;Woodstra, Chris et al. (2005) All music guide to classical music: the definitive guide to classical music&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Symphony No. 1 can be regarded as a result of Beethoven's bold musical experimentation and advancement which he presents five years after [[Haydn]]'s [[Symphony No. 104 (Haydn)|last symphony]] and twelve years after [[Mozart]]'s final ''[[Jupiter Symphony]]'': Unusually, Beethoven's Symphony No. 1 starts with a sequence of repeatedly accentuated [[Dominant (music)|dominant]]–[[Tonic (music)|tonic]] [[chord sequence]]s, however, in the "wrong" key and untouching and leading away from the tonic, so that the listener only gradually realizes the real key (or home key) of the symphony.

In correlation to the tradition, however, the first movement is composed exemplarily in [[sonata form]]. Here, as a new element, Beethoven uses the more lyrical [[second subject]] to display and intertwine the woodwind with the string instruments. The [[Musical development|development]] is elaborate and mainly based on the [[first subject]] of the movement and explores a long [[harmony (music)|harmonic]] progression (starting from [[A major]], reaching [[F-flat major|F{{music|flat}} major]], passing F major at the end); it also refines the juxtaposition and combination of the orchestral instruments (woodwinds and strings); the [[Recapitulation (music)|recapitulation]] is almost coherent with the [[Exposition (music)|exposition]]; the [[coda (music)|coda]] reminisces the [[motive (music)|motivic]] work of the development before it closes the movement with strongly repeated chords played by the whole orchestra.

Due to Beethoven's [[metronome]] markings and the addition of the indication of ''con moto'' ("with motion"), the ''Andante'' (in F major, the [[subdominant]] of the symphony's [[Tonic (music)|home key]]) of the second movement is played considerably faster than the general concept of that tempo. In contrast to the tradition, Beethoven uses the entire instrumentation of the orchestra (2nd flute [[tacet]]) and, consequently, displays a vast spectrum of sound in this movement which, as well, is composed in sonata form.

The third movement is on the one hand remarkable, because, although it is indicated as ''Menuetto'', it is marked ''Allegro molto e vivace'' and, consequently, to be played so fast that it is essentially a ''[[Scherzo]]'' – a description mostly used after Beethoven's first symphony. Secondly, as an inherent element of the ''scherzo'', it does not customarily display new melodies or motives, but instead uses the [[musical scale]]s and [[Triad (music)|triads]] from the first movement as motivic material which render this movement's momentum and wit.

The finale opens with another introduction consisting only of scale fragments played slowly by the first violins alone (an unusual effect) beginning on G and gradually adding more notes. After finally reaching an F, outlining a [[dominant seventh chord]] in C major, the real start of the finale ''Allegro molto e vivace'' begins in C major with a theme similar (both in rhythm and character) to the 4th movement of [[Symphony No. 88 (Haydn)|Haydn's Symphony No. 88 in G major]]. Composed again in a solid sonata form, Beethoven uses the scale as the prevailing motivic element in this movement which, by character, pays most of all tribute to the customary finale established by Haydn in the preceding decades.

The musical form is in accordance with the established composing tradition. Musical content, instrumentation as well as tempi, is unusual, if not revolutionary, in its use for a symphonic work of Beethoven's time. Therefore, Beethoven introduced himself with this work uniquely and boldly as an advancing symphonic composer and stood true to this statement throughout his compositional life.

"These notes are of varying subject: sometimes amplification of the theme, sometimes book references, sometimes biographical; some stories, too, have no note at all, though not many, being either self-explanatory or – in Sufi style – entities in themselves which should not be interfered with." &lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com page on The Dermis Probe&lt;/ref&gt;

The title piece is a modern retelling of the ''[[Blind men and an elephant]]'' published by [[Sanai]] of [[Ghazna]] in [[Afghanistan]]. This story was later published by Sanai's student, the poet and mystic Jalaludin [[Rumi]] in his ''[[Masnavi]]'' in the latter half of the thirteenth century.

Shah's adaptation begins with a conference of scientists, from different fields of expertise, presenting their distorted conclusions on the material which the camera is focused upon. As the camera slowly zooms out it becomes clear for the first time that the material under examination is the hide of an African elephant. The words 'The Parts Are Greater Than The Whole' then appear on the screen.

This retelling formed the script for a short four-minute film by the animator [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Internet Movie Database page on The Dermis Probe&lt;/ref&gt; The film was chosen as an Outstanding Film of the Year and was exhibited at the [[London]] and [[New York City]] film festivals.&lt;ref&gt;Octagon Press page for The Dermis Probe&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

''[[The Guardian]]'' review commented that; “Shah's materials take people by surprise...such a sharp angle to our current conventions...like a peep-show into a world which most people do not imagine exists.”  &lt;ref&gt;The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' book review wrote that “...The Dermis Probe develops the theme of patterns of material – arrangements: it is necessary to remember that the position of a story and its relation to others – which may be in other volumes – can be important.”&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Book Review&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Ninth Wave''''' ({{lang-ru|Девятый вал}}, ''Dyevyatiy val'') is an [[1850 in art|1850]] painting by the Russian Armenian [[marine art|marine painter]] [[Ivan Aivazovsky]]. It is his best-known work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ninth Wave|url=http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_0_32_1.html|publisher=[[Hermitage Museum]]|accessdate=1 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104185704/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/05/hm5_9_0_32_1.html|archivedate=4 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aivazovsky, I.

The title refers to an old sailing expression referring to a wave of incredible size that comes after a succession of incrementally larger waves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://framing.indiana.edu/2015/01/05/debating-globalization-ninth-wave/ Debating Globalization and the Ninth Wave] at University of Indiana Framing the Global Program Debate&lt;/ref&gt;

It depicts a sea after a night storm and people facing death attempting to save themselves by clinging to debris from a wrecked ship. The debris, in the shape of the cross,  appears to be a Christian metaphor for  salvation from the earthly sin. The painting has warm tones, which reduce the sea's apparent menacing overtones and a chance for the people to survive seems plausible. This painting shows the destructive side, and beauty of nature.

'''''Tim Gunn's Guide to Style''''' is an American reality television series on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]. The series debuted on September 6, 2007 and is hosted by ''[[Project Runway]]'''s [[Tim Gunn]], and co-hosted by model [[Veronica Webb]] in the first season and Gretta Monahan in the second season.&lt;ref name="cohost"&gt;[http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-grettamonahantimgunnsguidetostyle,0,6331234.story], Gretta Monahan in, Veronica Webb out on 'Tim Gunn's Guide to Style.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunn and his cohost offer to [[makeover|make over]] guests following their style as long as they adhere to a set of style rules.

==Format==
The show's format consists of several segments. After meeting the guest and reviewing an interview tape, the show starts with the hosts reviewing and then discarding most of the guest's existing [[clothing|wardrobe]]. Another segment involves the use of OptiTex fashion design software to illustrate the appearance of different fashions on a computer simulation of the guest, followed by a solo shopping spree for "ten essential items", which the hosts then critique. The guest will also meet with specialty consultants, such as designers, hairdressers or runway coaches, for one-on-one coaching. The show ends with a revealing to the guest's friends and family to show off the changes in their style.
