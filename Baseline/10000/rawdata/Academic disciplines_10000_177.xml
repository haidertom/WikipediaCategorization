'''Artificial philosophy''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] branch conceived by author Louis Molnar&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267156955_A_Step_Beyond_AI_Artificial_Philosophy "article: Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications", ResearchGate, (retrieved November 25, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt; to consider what a being bestowed with [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) might consider about its own [[existence]] once it reaches a higher state of [[consciousness]]. The author reasons in his dissertation that at some point, either through [[Computer_programming|programming]] or organic [[self-development]], [[robot]]s will not see themselves as extensions of those that created them, and that their saying "Who am I?" will not lead them to think of themselves as one with [[human]]s.

{{Close Relationships|emotions}}
In [[psychology]], the [[theory of attachment]] can be applied to adult relationships including friendships, emotional affairs, adult romantic or platonic relationships and in some cases relationships with inanimate objects ("[[transitional objects]]").&lt;ref name= "Hooley JM, Wilson-Murphy M"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hooley JM.|author2=Wilson-Murphy M.|title=Adult attachment to transitional objects and borderline personality disorder|pmid=22486448|doi=10.1521/pedi.2012.26.2.179|volume=26|journal=J Pers Disord|pages=179-91}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory, initially studied in the 1960s and 1970s primarily in the context of children and parents, was extended to adult relationships in the late 1980s.

Four main styles of attachment have been identified in adults:
*secure
*anxious-preoccupied
*dismissive-avoidant
*fearful-avoidant

Investigators have explored the organization and the stability of mental ''working models'' that underlie these attachment styles. They have also explored how attachment impacts relationship outcomes and how attachment functions in relationship dynamics.

==Extending attachment theory==
[[Mary Ainsworth]] and [[John Bowlby]] founded modern attachment theory on studies of children and their caregivers. Children and caregivers remained the primary focus of attachment theory for many years. Then, in the late 1980s, Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver applied attachment theory to adult relationships.&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 87"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hazan C. |author2=Shaver P.R. |title=Romantic love conceptualized as an attachment process |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=52 |issue=3 |pages=511–24 |date=March 1987 |pmid=3572722 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.3.511 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/52/3/511}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1990 | title = Love and work: An attachment theoretical perspective | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 270–280 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.270}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hazan Shaver 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hazan | first1 = C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment as an organizational framework for research on close relationships | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 1–22 | doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0501_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hazan and Shaver noticed that interactions between adults shared similarities to interactions between children and caregivers. For example, romantic or platonic partners desire to be close to one another. Adults feel comforted when their attachments are present and anxious or lonely when they are absent. Romantic relationships, for example, serve as a secure base that help people face the surprises, opportunities, and challenges life presents. Similarities such as these led Hazan and Shaver to extend attachment theory to adult relationships.

Relationships between adults differ in many ways from relationships between children and caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://internal.psychology.illinois.edu/~rcfraley/attachment.htm|title=A Brief Overview of Adult Attachment Theory and Research {{!}} R. Chris Fraley|website=internal.psychology.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The claim is not that these two kinds of relationships are identical. The claim is that the core principles of attachment theory apply to both kinds of relationships.

Investigators tend to describe the core principles of attachment theory in light of their own theoretical interests. Their descriptions seem quite different on a superficial level. For example, Fraley and Shaver&lt;ref name="Fraley Shaver 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraley | first1 = R.C. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 2000 | title = Adult attachment: Theoretical developments, emerging controversies, and unanswered questions | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 132–154 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.132}}&lt;/ref&gt; describe the "central propositions" of attachment in adults as follows:
* The emotional and behavioral dynamics of infant–caregiver relationships and adult relationships are governed by the same biological system.
* The kinds of individual differences observed in infant–caregiver relationships are similar to the ones observed in various close adult relationships.
* Individual differences in adult attachment behavior are reflections of the expectations and beliefs people have formed about themselves and their close relationships on the basis of their attachment histories; these "working models" are relatively stable and, as such, may be reflections of early caregiving experiences.
* Romantic love, as commonly conceived, involves the interplay of attachment, caregiving and intimacy.

Compare this with the five "core propositions" of attachment theory listed by Rholes and Simpson:&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson 04"&gt;Rholes, W.S. &amp; Simpson, J.A. (2004). Attachment theory: Basic concepts and contemporary questions. In W.S. Rholes and J.A. Simpson (Eds.), ''Adult Attachment: Theory, Research, and Clinical Implications'', pp. 3–14. New York, NY: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although the basic impetus for the formation of attachment relationships is provided by biological factors, the bonds that children form with their caregivers are shaped by interpersonal experience.
* Experiences in earlier relationships create internal working models and attachment styles that systematically affect attachment relationships.
* The attachment orientations of adult caregivers influence the attachment bond their children have with them.
* Working models and attachment orientations are relatively stable over time, but they are not impervious to change.
* Some forms of psychological maladjustment and clinical disorders are attributable in part to the effects of insecure working models and attachment styles.

While these two lists clearly reflect the theoretical interests of the investigators who created them, a closer look reveals a number of shared themes. The shared themes claim that:
* People are biologically driven to form attachments with others, but the process of forming attachments is influenced by learning experiences.
* Individuals form different kinds of attachments depending on the expectations and beliefs they have about their relationships. These expectations and beliefs constitute internal "working models" used to guide relationship behaviors.
* Internal "working models" are relatively stable even though they can be influenced by experience.
* Individual differences in attachment can contribute positively or negatively to mental health and to the quality of relationships with others.

No doubt these themes could be described in a variety of ways (and other themes added to the list). Regardless of how one describes the core principles of attachment theory, the key insight is that the same principles of attachment apply to close relationships throughout the lifespan. The principles of attachment between children and caregivers are fundamentally the same as the principles of attachment between adults.

==Styles==
Adults are described as having 4 attachment styles: Secure, Anxious-preoccupied, Dismissive-avoidant, and Fearful-avoidant.

The secure attachment style in adults corresponds to the secure attachment style in children. The anxious–preoccupied attachment style in adults corresponds to the anxious-ambivalent attachment style in children. However, the dismissive-avoidant attachment style and the fearful-avoidant attachment style, which are distinct in adults, correspond to a single avoidant attachment style in children. The descriptions of adult attachment styles offered below are based on the relationship questionnaire devised by Bartholomew and Horowitz&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartholomew K, Horowitz LM |title=Attachment styles among young adults: a test of a four-category model |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=61 |issue=2 |pages=226–44 |date=August 1991 |pmid=1920064 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.61.2.226 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/61/2/226}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on a review of studies by Pietromonaco and Barrett.&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 97"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pietromonaco PR, Barrett LF |title=Working models of attachment and daily social interactions |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=73 |issue=6 |pages=1409–23 |date=December 1997 |pmid=9418285 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.73.6.1409 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/73/6/1409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several attachment-based treatment approaches that can be used with adults.&lt;ref name="Sable 00"&gt;Sable, P., (2000). Attachment &amp; Adult Psychotherapy. Northvale NJ: Aaronson.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is an approach to treating couples based on [[attachment theory]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 02"&gt;Johnson, S., (2002). Emotionally Focused Couples Therapy with Trauma Survivors. NY: Guilford.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secure===
Securely attached people tend to agree with the following statements: "It is relatively easy for me to become emotionally close to others. I am comfortable depending on others and having others depend on me. I don't worry about being alone or others not accepting me." This style of attachment usually results from a history of warm and responsive interactions with their attachments. Securely attached people tend to have positive views of themselves and their attachments. They also tend to have positive views of their relationships. Often they report greater satisfaction and adjustment in their relationships than people with other attachment styles. Securely attached people feel comfortable both with intimacy and with independence. 

Secure attachment and adaptive functioning are promoted by a caregiver who is emotionally available and appropriately responsive to his or her child's attachment behavior, as well as capable of regulating both his or her positive and negative emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sable|first=Pat|title=What is Adult Attachment?|journal=Clin Soc Work J|date=2008|volume=36 |pages=21–30 |doi=10.1007/s10615-007-0110-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insecure===

==== Anxious-preoccupied ====
People with anxious-preoccupied attachment type tend to agree with the following statements: "I want to be completely emotionally intimate with others, but I often find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like", and "I am uncomfortable being without close relationships, but I sometimes worry that others don't value me as much as I value them." People with this style of attachment seek high levels of [[intimacy]], approval, and responsiveness from their attachment figure. They sometimes value intimacy to such an extent that they become overly dependent on the attachment figure. Compared with securely attached people, people who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment tend to have less positive views about themselves. They may feel a sense of anxiousness that only recedes when in contact with the attachment figure. They often [[doubt]] their worth as a person and blame themselves for the attachment figure's lack of responsiveness. People who are anxious or preoccupied with attachment may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, [[emotional dysregulation]], worry, and [[impulsiveness]] in their relationships.

==== Dismissive-avoidant ====
People with a dismissive style of avoidant attachment tend to agree with these statements: "I am comfortable without close emotional relationships", "It is  important to me to feel independent and self-sufficient", and "I prefer not to depend on others or have others depend on me." People with this attachment style desire a high level of independence. The desire for independence often appears as an attempt to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient and invulnerable to feelings associated with being closely attached to others. They often deny needing close relationships. Some may even view close relationships as relatively unimportant. Not surprisingly, they seek less intimacy with attachments, whom they often view less positively than they view themselves. Investigators commonly note the [[Defense mechanism|defensive]] character of this attachment style. People with a dismissive-avoidant attachment style tend to suppress and hide their feelings, and they tend to deal with [[Social rejection|rejection]] by distancing themselves from the sources of rejection (e.g. their attachments or relationships).

==== Fearful-avoidant ====
People with losses or other trauma, such as sexual abuse in childhood and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Contextualizing the effects of childhood sexual abuse on adult self- and social functioning: an attachment theory perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0145213499000812 | doi=10.1016/S0145-2134(99)00081-2 | volume=23|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|pages=1141–1157}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tend to agree with the following statements: "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, but I find it difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to other people."
They tend to feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness, and the mixed feelings are combined with sometimes unconscious, negative views about themselves and their attachments. They commonly view themselves as unworthy of responsiveness from their attachments, and they don't trust the intentions of their attachments. Similar to the dismissive-avoidant attachment style, people with a fearful-avoidant attachment style seek less intimacy from attachments and frequently suppress and deny their feelings. Because of this, they are much less comfortable expressing affection.

==Working models==
Bowlby observed that children learn from their interactions with caregivers. Over the course of many interactions, children form expectations about the accessibility and helpfulness of their caregivers. These expectations reflect children's thoughts about themselves and about their caregivers:
{{quote|Confidence that an attachment figure is, apart from being accessible, likely to be responsive can be seen to turn on at least two variables: (a) whether or not the attachment figure is judged to be the sort of person who in general responds to calls for support and protection; (b) whether or not the self is judged to be the sort of person towards whom anyone, and the attachment figure in particular, is likely to respond in a helpful way. Logically, these variables are independent. In practice they are apt to be confounded. As a result, the model of the attachment figure and the model of the self are likely to develop so as to be complementary and mutually confirming. (Bowlby, 1973, p. 238)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 73"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1973). Separation: Anxiety &amp; Anger, Volume 2 of Attachment and loss London. Hogarth Press; New York: Basic Books; Harmondsworth: Penguin (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Children's thoughts about their caregivers, together with thoughts about how deserving they are themselves of good care from their caregivers, form ''working models'' of attachment. Working models help guide behavior by allowing children to anticipate and plan for caregiver responses. Bowlby theorized that once formed,  working models remain relatively stable. Children usually interpret experiences in the light of their working models, rather than change their working models to fit new experiences. However, when experiences cannot be interpreted in the light of their working models children may then modify their working models.

When Hazen and Shaver extended attachment theory to romantic relationships in adults, they also included the idea of working models. Research into adult working models has focused on two issues. First, how are the thoughts that form working models organized in the mind? Second, how stable are working models across time? These questions are briefly discussed below.

===Organization of working models===
Bartholomew and Horowitz have proposed that working models consist of two parts.&lt;ref name="Bartholomew Horowitz 91"/&gt; One part deals with thoughts about the self. The other part deals with thoughts about others. They further propose that a person's thoughts about self are generally positive or generally negative. The same applies to a person's thoughts about others. In order to test these proposals, Bartholomew and Horowitz have looked at the relationship between attachment styles, self-esteem, and sociability. The diagram below shows the relationships they observed:
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable" align="center"
|+ Security-based strategy of affect regulation
! colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="background: none;" |
! colspan=2 | Self-esteem&lt;br&gt;(thoughts about self)
|-
! Positive
! Negative
|-
! rowspan=2 | Sociability&lt;br&gt;(thoughts about others)
! Positive
| Secure
| Anxious-preoccupied
|-
! Negative
| Dismissive-avoidant
| Fearful-avoidant
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

The secure and dismissive attachment styles are associated with higher self-esteem compared with the anxious and fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about the self in working models. The secure and anxious attachment styles are associated with higher sociability than the dismissive or fearful attachment styles. This corresponds to the distinction between positive and negative thoughts about others in working models. These results suggested working models indeed contain two distinct domains—thoughts about self and thoughts about others—and that each domain can be characterized as generally positive or generally negative.

Baldwin and colleagues have applied the theory of relational schemas to working models of attachment. Relational schemas contain information about the way the attachment figure regularly interact with each other.&lt;ref name= "Baldwin 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1992 | title = Relational schemas and the processing of social information | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 112 | issue = | pages = 461–484 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.112.3.461}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | year = 1997 | title = Relational schemas as a source of if-then self-inference procedures | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 326–335 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.1.4.326}}&lt;/ref&gt; For each pattern of interaction that regularly occurs between partners, a relational schema is formed that contains:
* information about the self
* information about the attachment
* information about the way the interaction usually unfolds.

For example, if a person regularly asks his or her partner for a hug or kiss, and the partner regularly responds with a hug or kiss, the person forms a relational schema representing the predictable interaction. The schema contains information about the self (e.g., "I need lots of physical affection"). It also contains information about the partner (e.g., "My partner is an affectionate person"). And it contains information about the way the interaction usually unfolds, which can be summarized by an if–then statement (e.g., "''If'' I ask my partner for a hug or kiss, ''then'' my partner will respond with a hug or kiss and comfort me"). Relational schemas help guide behavior in relationships by allowing people to anticipate and plan for partner responses.

Baldwin and colleagues have proposed that working models of attachment are composed of relational schemas. The fact that relational schemas contain information about the self and information about others is consistent with previous conceptions of working models. The unique contribution of relational schemas to working models is the information about the way interactions with attachments usually unfold. Relational schemas add the if–then statements about interactions to working models. To demonstrate that working models are organized as relational schemas, Baldwin and colleagues created a set of written scenarios that described interactions dealing with trust, dependency and closeness.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr Keedian Seidel Thompson 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | last3 = Keedian | first3 = E. | last4 = Seidel | first4 = M. | last5 = Thompson | first5 = D.W. | year = 1993 | title = An exploration of the relational schemata underlying attachment styles: self-report and lexical decision approaches | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 19 | issue = | pages = 746–754 | doi=10.1177/0146167293196010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the scenarios for closeness included:
* You want to spend more time with your attachment.
* You reach out to hug or kiss your partner.
* You tell your attachment how deeply you feel for him or her.

Following each scenario, people were presented with two options about how their attachments might respond. One option was "he/she accepts you." The other option was "he/she rejects you." People were asked to rate the likelihood of each response on a seven-point scale. Ratings of likely attachment responses corresponded to people's attachment styles. People with secure attachment styles were more likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my partner will accept me." People with other attachment styles were less likely to expect accepting responses from their attachments. Their relational schema for the third closeness scenario would be, "''If'' I tell my partner how deeply I feel for him or her, ''then'' my attachment will reject me." Differences in attachment styles reflected differences in relational schemas. Relational schemas may therefore be used to understand the organization of working models of attachment, as has been demonstrated in subsequent studies.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Fehr | first2 = B. | year = 1995 | title = On the Instability of Attachment Style Ratings | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 247–261 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1995.tb00090.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Keelan | first2 = J.P.R. | last3 = Fehr | first3 = B. | last4 = Enns | first4 = V. | last5 = Koh-Rangarajoo | first5 = E. | year = 1996 | title = Social-cognitive conceptualization of attachment working models: Availability and accessibility effects | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 94–109 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.1.94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Baldwin Meunier 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baldwin | first1 = M.W. | last2 = Meunier | first2 = J. | year = 1999 | title = The Cued Activation of Attachment Relational Schemas | url = | journal = Social Cognition | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 209–227 | doi=10.1521/soco.1999.17.2.209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relational schemas involved in working models are likely organized into a hierarchy. According to Baldwin:
{{quote|A person may have a general working model of relationships, for instance, to the effect that others tend to be only partially and unpredictably responsive to one's needs. At a more specific level, this expectation will take different forms when considering different role relationships, such as customer or romantic partner. Within romantic relationships, expectations might then vary significantly depending on the specific attachment, or the specific situation, or the specific needs being expressed. (Baldwin, 1992, p. 429).&lt;ref name="Baldwin 92"/&gt;}}

The highest level of the hierarchy contains very general relational schemas that apply to all relationships. The next level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas that apply to particular kinds of relationships. The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relationship schemas that apply to specific relationships.

In fact, several theorists have proposed a hierarchical organization of working models.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 80"&gt;Bowlby, J.

{{quote|From this perspective, people do not hold a single set of working models of the self and others; rather, they hold a family of models that include, at higher levels, abstract rules or assumptions about attachment relationships and, at lower levels, information about specific relationships and events within relationships. These ideas also imply that working models are not a single entity but are multifaceted representations in which information at one level need not be consistent with information at another level. (Pietromonaco &amp; Barrett, 2000, page 159)&lt;ref name="Pietromonaco Barrett 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pietromonaco | first1 = P.R. | last2 = Barrett | first2 = L.F. | year = 2000 | title = The internal working models concept: What do we really know about the self in relation to others? | url = | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 155–175 | doi=10.1037/1089-2680.4.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Every hierarchy for working models includes both general working models (higher in the hierarchy) and relationship-specific working models (lower in the hierarchy). Studies have supported the existence of both general working models and relationship-specific working models. People can report a general attachment style when asked to do so, and the majority of their relationships are consistent with their general attachment style.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Keelan Fehr Enns Koh-Rangarajoo 96"/&gt; A general attachment style indicates a general working model that applies to many relationships. Yet, people also report different styles of attachments to their friends, parents and lovers.&lt;ref name="Trinke Bartholomew 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trinke | first1 = S.J. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1997 | title = Hierarchies of attachment relationships in young adulthood | url = | journal = [[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]] | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 603–625 | doi=10.1177/0265407597145002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Guardia Ryan Couchman Deci 00"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=La Guardia JG, Ryan RM, Couchman CE, Deci EL |title=Within-person variation in security of attachment: a self-determination theory perspective on attachment, need fulfillment, and well-being |journal=J Pers Soc Psychol |volume=79 |issue=3 |pages=367–84 |date=September 2000 |pmid=10981840 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.79.3.367 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/psp/79/3/367}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relationship-specific attachment styles indicate relationship-specific working models. Evidence that general working models and relationship-specific working models are organized into a hierarchy comes from a study by Overall, Fletcher and Friesen.&lt;ref name="Overall Fletcher Friesen 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Overall | first1 = N.C. | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = G.J.O. | last3 = Friesen | first3 = M.D. | year = 2003 | title = Mapping the [[intimate relationship]] mind: Comparisons between three models of attachment representations | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 29 | issue = | pages = 1479–1493 | doi=10.1177/0146167203251519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In summary, the mental working models that underlie attachment styles appear to contain information about self and information about others organized into relational schemas. The relational schemas are themselves organized into a three-tier hierarchy. The highest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for a general working model that applies to all relationships. The middle level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models that apply to different types of relationships (e.g., friends, parents, lovers). The lowest level of the hierarchy contains relational schemas for working models of specific relationships.

===Stability of working models===
Investigators study the stability of working models by looking at the stability of attachment styles. Attachment styles reflect the thoughts and expectations that constitute working models. Changes in attachment styles therefore indicate changes in working models.

Around 70–80% of people experience no significant changes in attachment styles over time.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Fehr 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Merrick | first2 = S. | last3 = Treboux | first3 = D. | last4 = Crowell | first4 = J. | last5 = Albersheim | first5 = L. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security in infancy and early adulthood: A twenty-year longitudinal study | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 684–689 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00176 | pmid=10953934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Hazen 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L. | last2 = Hazen | first2 = C. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment styles and close relationships: A four year prospective study | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 123–142 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00058.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J. | last2 = Noller | first2 = P. | year = 1992 | title = Attachment style and romantic love: Relationship dissolution | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = | pages = 69–74 | doi=10.1080/00049539208260145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scharfe Bartholomew 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Scharfe | first1 = E. | last2 = Bartholomew | first2 = K. | year = 1994 | title = Reliability and stability of adult attachment patterns | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 23–43 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00053.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that attachment styles do not change for a majority of people indicates working models are relatively stable. Yet, around 20–30% of people do experience changes in attachment styles. These changes can occur over periods of weeks or months. The number of people who experience changes in attachment styles, and the short periods over which the changes occur, suggest working models are not rigid personality traits.

Why attachment styles change is not well understood. Waters, Weinfield and Hamilton propose that negative life experiences often cause changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Weinfield Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Waters | first1 = E. | last2 = Weinfield | first2 = N.S. | last3 = Hamilton | first3 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = The stability of attachment styles from infancy to adolescence and early adulthood: General discussion | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 703–706 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00179}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their proposal is supported by evidence that people who experience negative life events also tend to experience changes in attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Waters Merrick Treboux Crowell Albersheim 00"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Hamilton 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = C.E. | year = 2000 | title = Continuity and discontinuity of attachment from infancy through adolescence | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 690–694 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00177}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weinfield Sroufe Egelund 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weinfield | first1 = N.

The study found that all four sets of factors cause changes in attachment styles. Changes in attachment styles are complex and depend on multiple factors.

==Relationship outcomes==
Adult relationships vary in their outcomes. The participants of some relationships express more [[Contentment|satisfaction]] than the participants of other relationships. The participants of some relationships stay together longer than the partners of other relationships. Does attachment influence the satisfaction and duration of relationships?

===Satisfaction===
Several studies have linked attachment styles to relationship satisfaction. People who have secure attachment styles usually express greater satisfaction with their relationships than people who have other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Brennan Shaver 95"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brennan | first1 = K.A. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | year = 1995 | title = Dimensions of adult attachment, affect regulation, and romantic relationship functioning | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 267–283 | doi=10.1177/0146167295213008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, communication patterns and satisfaction across the life cycle of marriage | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 1 | issue = | pages = 333–348 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1994.tb00069.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney 96"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1996 | title = Attachment, caregiving, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 401–416 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1996.tb00124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney Noller Callan 94"&gt;Feeney, J.A., Noller, P., &amp; Callan, V.J.

Although the link between attachment styles and marital satisfaction has been firmly established, the mechanisms by which attachment styles influence marital satisfaction remain poorly understood. One mechanism may be communication. Secure attachment styles may lead to more constructive communication and more intimate self-disclosures, which in turn increase relationship satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Feeney 94"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Keelan Dion Dion 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Keelan | first1 = J.P.R. | last2 = Dion | first2 = K.K. | last3 = Dion | first3 = K.L. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment style and relationship satisfaction: Test of a self-disclosure explanation | url = | journal = Canadian Journal of Behavioural Science | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 24–35 | doi=10.1037/h0087055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other mechanisms by which attachment styles may influence relationship satisfaction include emotional expressiveness,&lt;ref name="Feeney 99"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Feeney | first1 = J.A. | year = 1999 | title = Adult attachment, emotional control, and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 169–185 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1999.tb00185.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury Fincham 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | last3 = Fincham | first3 = F. | year = 1998 | title = Negative affectivity as a mediator of the association between adult attachment and marital satisfaction | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 467–484 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00183.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategies for coping with conflict,&lt;ref name="Lussier Sabourin Turgeon 97"/&gt; and perceived support from partners.&lt;ref name="Meyers Landsberger 02"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cobb | first1 = R.J. | last2 = Davila | first2 = J. | last3 = Bradbury | first3 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment security and marital satisfaction: The role of positive perceptions and social support | url = | journal = [[Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin]] | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 1131–1143 | doi=10.1177/0146167201279006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies are needed to better understand how attachment styles influence relationship satisfaction.

===Duration===
Some studies suggest people with secure attachment styles have longer-lasting relationships.&lt;ref name="Simpson 90"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | year = 1990 | title = Influence of attachment styles on romantic relationships | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 971–980 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.5.971}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Duemmler Kobak 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Duemmler | first1 = S.L. | last2 = Kobak | first2 = R. | year = 2001 | title = The development of commitment and attachment in dating relationships: attachment security as relationship construct | url = | journal = Journal of Adolescence | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 401–415 | doi=10.1006/jado.2001.0406}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be partly due to commitment. People with secure attachment styles tend to express more commitment to their relationships. People with secure attachment styles also tend to be more satisfied with their relationships, which may encourage them to stay in their relationships longer. However, secure attachment styles are by no means a guarantee of long-lasting relationships.

Nor are secure attachment styles the only attachment styles associated with stable relationships. People with anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often find themselves in long-lasting, but unhappy, relationships.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick Davis 94"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kirkpatrick | first1 = L.A. | last2 = Davis | first2 = K.E. | year = 1994 | title = Attachment style, gender, and relationship stability: A longitudinal analysis | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 66 | issue = | pages = 502–512 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.3.502}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davila Bradbury 01"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davila | first1 = J. | last2 = Bradbury | first2 = T.N. | year = 2001 | title = Attachment insecurity and the distinction between unhappy spouses who do and do not divorce | url = | journal = Journal of Family Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 371–393 | doi=10.1037/0893-3200.15.3.371}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anxious–preoccupied attachment styles often involve anxiety about being abandoned and doubts about one's worth as a relationship. These kinds of feelings and thoughts may lead people to stay in unhappy relationships.

==Relationship dynamics==
Attachment plays a role in the way actors interact with one another. A few examples include the role of attachment in affect regulation, support, intimacy, and [[jealousy]]. These examples are briefly discussed below. Attachment also plays a role in many interactions not discussed in this article, such as conflict, communication and sexuality.&lt;ref name="Rholes Simpson Stevens 98"&gt;Rholes, W.S., Simpson, J.A., &amp; Stevens, J.G.

===Affect regulation===
Bowlby, in studies with children, observed that certain kinds of events trigger anxiety, and that people try to relieve their anxiety by seeking closeness and comfort from caregivers.&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969/1982) Attachment, Vol. 1 of Attachment and loss. London: Hogarth Press. New York: Basic Books (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; Three main sets of conditions trigger anxiety in children:
* Conditions of the child (fatigue, hunger, illness, pain, cold, etc.)
* Conditions involving the caregiver (caregiver absent, caregiver departing, caregiver discouraging of proximity, caregiver giving attention to another child, etc.)
* Conditions of the environment (alarming events, criticism or rejection by others)

The anxiety triggered by these conditions motivates the individuals to engage in behaviors that bring them physically closer to caregivers. A similar dynamic occurs in adults in relationships where others care about them. Conditions involving personal well-being, conditions involving a relationship partner, and conditions involving the environment can trigger anxiety in adults. Adults try to alleviate their anxiety by seeking physical and psychological closeness to their partners.

Mikulincer, Shaver and Pereg have developed a model for this dynamic.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Shaver | first2 = P.R. | last3 = Pereg | first3 = D. | year = 2003 | title = Attachment theory and affect regulation: The dynamics, development, and cognitive consequences of attachment-related strategies | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 77–102 | doi=10.1023/a:1024515519160}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the model, when people experience anxiety, they try to reduce their anxiety by seeking closeness with relationship partners. However, the partners may accept or reject requests for greater closeness. This leads people to adopt different strategies for reducing anxiety. People engage in three main strategies to reduce anxiety.

The first strategy is called the ''security-based'' strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the security-based strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Security Based.png|border|center|Security-based strategy of affect regulation.]]
A person perceives something that provokes anxiety. The person tries to reduce the anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. The attachment responds positively to the request for closeness, which reaffirms a sense of security and reduces anxiety. The person returns to her or his everyday activities.

The second strategy is called the ''hyperactivation'', or anxiety attachment, strategy. The diagram below shows the sequence of events in the hyperactivation strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Hyperactivation.png|border|center|Hyperactivation strategy of affect regulation.]]
The events begin the same way. Something provokes anxiety in a person, who then tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to their attachment. The attachment rebuffs the request for greater closeness. The lack of responsiveness increases feelings of insecurity and anxiety. The person then gets locked into a cycle with the attachment: the person tries to get closer, the attachment rejects the request for greater closeness, which leads the person to try even harder to get closer, followed by another rejection from the attachment, and so on. The cycle ends only when the situation shifts to a security-based strategy (because the attachment finally responds positively) or when the person switches to an attachment avoidant strategy (because the person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment).

The third strategy is called the ''attachment avoidance'' strategy. The following diagram shows the sequence of events in the attachment avoidance strategy.
[[File:Attachment Theory Attachment Avoidance.png|border|center|Attachment avoidance strategy of affect regulation.]]
The events begin the same way as the security-based strategy. A person perceives something that triggers anxiety, and the person tries to reduce anxiety by seeking physical or psychological closeness to her or his attachment. But the attachment is either unavailable or rebuffs the request for closeness. The lack of responsiveness fuels insecurity and heightens anxiety. The person gives up on getting a positive response from the attachment, suppresses her or his anxiety, and distances herself or himself from the attachment.

Mikulincer, Shaver, and Pereg contend these strategies of regulating attachment anxiety have very different consequences.&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Shaver Pereg 03"/&gt; The security-based strategy leads to more positive thoughts, such as more positive explanations of why others behave in a particular way and more positive memories about people and events. More positive thoughts can encourage more creative responses to difficult problems or distressing situations. The hyperactivation and attachment avoidance strategies lead to more negative thoughts and less creativity in handling problems and stressful situations. It is notable that the security-based strategy is contingent on a positive response from their attachment. From this perspective, it would benefit people to have attachments who are willing and able to respond positively to the person's request for closeness, so that they can use security-based strategies for dealing with their anxiety.

===Support===
People feel less anxious when close to their attachments because their attachments can provide support during difficult situations. Support includes the comfort, assistance, and information people receive from their attachments.

Attachment influences both the perception of support from others and the tendency to seek support from others. People who have attachments who respond consistently and positively to requests for closeness allow individuals to have secure attachments, and in return they seek more support, in a generally relaxed way, while people whose attachments are inconsistent in reacting positively or regularly reject requests for support find they need to use other attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Kobak Sceery 88"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kobak | first1 = R.R. | last2 = Sceery | first2 = A. | year = 1988 | title = Attachment in late adolescence: Working models, affect regulation, and representations of self and others | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 59 | issue = | pages = 135–146 | doi=10.2307/1130395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mikulincer Florian Weller 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mikulincer | first1 = M. | last2 = Florian | first2 = V. | last3 = Weller | first3 = A. | year = 1993 | title = Attachment styles, coping strategies, and post-traumatic psychological distress: The impact of the Gulf War in Israel | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 817–826 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.64.5.817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simpson Rholes Nelligan 92"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simpson | first1 = J.A. | last2 = Rholes | first2 = W.S. | last3 = Nelligan | first3 = J.S. | year = 1992 | title = Support seeking and support giving within couples in an anxiety provoking situation: The role of attachment styles | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 62 | issue = | pages = 434–446 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.62.3.434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Florian Mikulincer Bucholtz 95"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Florian V, Mikulincer M, Bucholtz I |title=Effects of adult attachment style on the perception and search for social support |journal=J Psychol |volume=129 |issue=6 |pages=665–76 |date=November 1995 |pmid=7500299 |doi=10.1080/00223980.1995.9914937}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with secure attachment styles may trust their attachments to provide support because their attachments have reliably offered support in the past. They may be more likely to ask for support when it's needed. People with insecure attachment styles often do not have a history of supportive responses from their attachments. They may rely less on their attachments and be less likely to ask for support when it's needed, though there may be other factors involved, as well.

Changes in the way people perceive attachment tend to occur with changes in the way people perceive support. One study looked at college students' perceptions of attachment to their mothers, fathers, same-sex friends, and opposite-sex friends&lt;ref name="Asendorpf Wilpers 00"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asendorpf | first1 = J.B. | last2 = Wilpers | first2 = S. | year = 2000 | title = Attachment security and available support: Closely linked relationship qualities | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 115–138 | doi=10.1177/0265407500171006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found that when students reported changes in attachment for a particular relationship, they usually reported changes in support for that relationship as well. Changes in attachment for one relationship did not affect the perception of support in other relationships. The link between changes in attachment and changes in support was relationship-specific.

===Intimacy===
Attachment theory has always recognized the importance of intimacy. Bowlby writes:
{{quote|Attachment theory regards the propensity to make intimate emotional bonds to particular individuals as a basic component of human nature, already present in germinal form in the neonate and continuing through adult life into old age. (Bowlby, 1988, pp. 120–121)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 88"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1988). A secure base. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The desire for intimacy has biological roots and, in the great majority of people, persists from birth until death. The desire for intimacy also has important implications for attachment. Relationships that frequently satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to more secure attachments. Relationships that rarely satisfy the desire for intimacy lead to less secure attachments.

Collins and Feeney have examined the relationship between attachment and intimacy in detail.&lt;ref name="Collins Feeney 04"&gt;Collins, N.L. &amp; Freeney, B.C. (2004). An Attachment Theory Perspective on Closeness and Intimacy. In D.J. Mashek &amp; A. Aron (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'', pp. 163–188. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; They define intimacy as a special set of interactions in which a person discloses something important about himself or herself, and their attachment responds to the disclosure in a way that makes the person feel validated, understood, and cared for. These interactions usually involve verbal self-disclosure. However, intimate interactions can also involve non-verbal forms of self-expression such as touching, hugging, kissing, and sexual behavior. From this perspective, intimacy requires the following:
* willingness to disclose one's true thoughts, feelings, wishes, and fears
* willingness to rely on an attachment for care and emotional support
* willingness to engage in physical intimacy in the case of romantic or potential romantic partners

Collins and Feeney review a number of studies showing how each attachment style relates to the willingness to self-disclose, the willingness to rely on partners, and the willingness to engage in physical intimacy. The secure attachment style is generally related to more self-disclosure, more reliance on partners, and more physical intimacy than other attachment styles. However, the amount of intimacy in a relationship can vary due to personality variables and situational circumstances, and so each attachment style may function to adapt an individual to the particular context of intimacy in which they live.

Mashek and Sherman report some findings on the desire for less closeness with partners.&lt;ref name="Mashek Sherman 04"&gt;Mashek, D.J., &amp; Sherman, M.D. (2004). Desiring less closeness with initimate others. In A. Aron and Mashek, D.J. (Eds.), ''Handbook of Closeness and Intimacy'' (pp. 343–356). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes too much intimacy can be suffocating. People in this situation desire less closeness with their partners. On one hand, the relationship between attachment styles and desire for less closeness is predictable. People who have fearful-avoidant and anxious-preoccupied attachment styles typically want greater closeness with their partners. People who have dismissive–avoidant attachment styles typically want less closeness with their partners. On the other hand, the relatively large numbers of people who admit to wanting less closeness with their partners (up to 57% in some studies) far outnumbers the people who have dismissive-avoidant attachment styles. This suggests people who have secure, anxious–preoccupied, or fearful-avoidant attachment styles sometimes seek less closeness with their partners. The desire for less closeness is not determined by attachment styles alone.

===Jealousy===
{{main|Jealousy}}
Jealousy refers to the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that occur when a person believes a valued relationship is threatened by a rival. A jealous person experiences anxiety about maintaining support, intimacy, and other valued qualities of her or his relationship. Given that attachment relates to anxiety regulation, support, and intimacy, as discussed above, it is not surprising that attachment also relates to jealousy.

Bowlby observed that attachment behaviors in children can be triggered by the presence of a rival:
{{quote|In most young children the mere sight of mother holding another baby in her arms is enough to elicit strong attachment behaviour. The older child insists on remaining close to his mother, or on climbing on to her lap. Often he behaves as though he were a baby. It is possible that this well-known behaviour is only a special case of a child reacting to mother's lack of attention and lack of responsiveness to him. The fact, however, that an older child often reacts in this way even when his mother makes a point of being attentive and responsive suggests that more is involved; and the pioneer experiments of Levy (1937) also indicate that the mere presence of a baby on mother's lap is sufficient to make an older child much more clinging. (Bowlby, 1969/1982, page 260)&lt;ref name="Bowlby 69"/&gt;}}

When children see a rival contending for a caregiver's attention, the children try to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention. Attempts to get close to the caregiver and capture the caregiver's attention indicate the attachment system has been activated. But the presence of a rival also provokes jealousy in children. The jealousy provoked by a sibling rival has been described in detail.&lt;ref name="Volling McElwain Miller 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Volling | first1 = B.L. | last2 = McElwain | first2 = N.L. | last3 = Miller | first3 = A.L. | year = 2002 | title = Emotion regulation in context: The jealousy complex between young siblings and its relations with child and family characteristics | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 73 | issue = | pages = 581–600 | doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown that a rival can provoke jealousy at very young ages. The presence of a rival can provoke jealousy in infants as young as six months old.&lt;ref name="Hart 02"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2002 | title = Jealousy in 6-month-old infants | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 395–402 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0303_6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hart 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hart | first1 = S. | year = 2004 | title = When infants lose exclusive maternal attention: Is it jealousy? | url = | journal = Infancy | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 57–78 | doi=10.1207/s15327078in0601_3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harris 04"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = C.R. | year = 2004 | title = The evolution of jealousy | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 62–71 | doi=10.1511/2004.45.919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment and jealousy can both be triggered in children by the presence of a rival.

Attachment and jealousy can be triggered by the same perceptual cues in adults, too.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sharpsteen | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Kirkpatrick | first2 = L.A. | year = 1997 | title = Romantic jealousy and adult romantic attachment | url = | journal = [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] | volume = 72 | issue = | pages = 627–640 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.72.3.627}}&lt;/ref&gt; The absence of the attachment can trigger both a need for close proximity and jealousy when people believe the attachment is spending time with a rival. The presence of a rival can also trigger greater need for attachment and jealousy.

Differences in attachment styles influence both the frequency and the pattern of jealous expressions. People who have anxious–preoccupied or fearful-avoidant attachment styles experience jealousy more often and view rivals as more threatening than people who have secure attachment styles.&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buunk 97"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Buunk | first1 = B.P. | year = 1997 | title = Personality, birth order and attachment styles as related to various types of jealousy | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 997–1006 | doi=10.1016/s0191-8869(97)00136-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Guerrero | first1 = L.K. | year = 1998 | title = Attachment-style differences in the experience and expression of romantic jealousy | url = | journal = Personal Relationships | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 273–291 | doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1998.tb00172.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Radecki-Bush Farrell Bush 93"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Radecki-Bush | first1 = C. | last2 = Farrell | first2 = A.D. | last3 = Bush | first3 = J.I. | year = 1993 | title = Predicting jealous responses: The influence of adult attachment and depression on threat appraisal | url = | journal = Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 569–588 | doi=10.1177/0265407593104006}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with different attachment styles also express jealousy in different ways. One study found that:
{{quote|Securely attached participants felt anger more intensely than other emotions and were relatively more likely than other participants to express it, especially toward their attachment. And although anxious participants felt anger relatively intensely, and were as likely as others to express it through irritability, they were relatively unlikely to actually confront their attachment. This might be attributable to feelings of inferiority and fear, which were especially characteristic of the anxiously attached and which might be expected to inhibit direct expressions of anger. Avoidants felt sadness relatively more intensely than did secures in both studies. Further, avoidants were relatively more likely than others to work to maintain their self-esteem and, perhaps as a consequence, relatively unlikely to be brought closer to their attachment. (Sharpsteen &amp; Kirkpatrick, 1997, page 637)&lt;ref name="Sharpsteen Kirkpatrick 97"/&gt;}}

A subsequent study has confirmed that people with different attachment styles experience and express jealousy in qualitatively different ways.&lt;ref name="Guerrero 98"/&gt; Attachment thus plays an important role in jealous interactions by influencing the frequency and the manner in which attachments express jealousy.

===After love===
After dissolution of important romantic relationships people usually go through separation anxiety and grieving. Grief is a process which leads to the acceptance of loss and usually allows the person to move on. During this process people use different strategies to cope. Securely attached individuals tend to look for support, the most effective coping strategy. Avoidantly attached individuals tend to devalue the relationships and to withdraw. Anxiously attached individuals are more likely to use emotionally focused coping strategies and pay more attention to the experienced distress (Pistole, 1996). After the end of the relationships, securely attached individuals tend to have less negative overall emotional experience than insecurely attached individuals  (Pistole, 1995).

===Same-sex relationships===
Ridge &amp; Feeney (1998) have studied a group of gays and lesbians in Australian universities. Results showed that the frequency of attachment styles in the gay and lesbian population was the same as in the heterosexual; at the same time attachment styles have predicted relationship variables in a similar way as in the heterosexual population. However, gay and lesbian adult attachment styles were not related to childhood experiences with parents. Contradicting this last result, Robinson (1999) has found that in the lesbian population there was a link between attachment styles and early parenting. However, unlike in heterosexual females, attachment style was related to participants' relationship with their fathers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8209">'''Availability''' is the probability that a system will work as required when required during the period of a mission. The mission could be the 18-hour span of an aircraft flight. The mission period could also be the 3 to 15-month span of a [[military deployment]]. Availability includes non-operational periods associated with reliability, maintenance, and logistics.

This is measured in terms of '''nines'''. Five-9's means less than 5 minutes when the system is not operating correctly over the span of one year.

Availability is only meaningful for supportable systems. As an example, availability of 99.9% means nothing after the only known source stops manufacturing a critical replacement part.

== Definition ==

There are two kinds of availability.
* Operational
* Predicted

Operational availability is presumed to be the same as predicted availability until after operational metrics become available.

===Availability===

Operational availability is based on observations after at least one system has been built. This usually begins with the [[brassboard]] system that is used to complete system development, and continues with the first of kind used for '''live fire test and evaluation''' (LFTE). Organizations responsible for maintenance use this to evaluate the effectiveness of the maintenance philosophy.

:&lt;math&gt; A_o = \frac {T_m}{T_m + T_d} \begin{cases}A_o = Operational \ Availability \\ T_m = Mission \ Duration  \\ T_d = Observed \ Down \ Time \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Predicted availability is based on a model of the system before it is built.

:&lt;math&gt; A_p = \frac {T_m}{T_m + T_d} \begin{cases} A_p = Predicted \ Availability \\ T_m = Mission \ Duration  \\ T_d = Model \ Down \ Time \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Downtime is the total of all of the different contributions that compromise operation. For modeling, these are different aspects of the model, such as human-system interface for MTTR and reliability modeling for MTBF. For observation, these reflect the different areas of the organization, such as maintenance personnel and documentation for MTTR, and manufacturers and shippers for MLDT.

: &lt;math&gt; T_d = T_m \times \frac {MTTR + MLDT + MAMDT}{MTBF} \begin{cases} T_d = Down \ Time \\ T_m = Mission \ Duration \\ MTTR = Mean \ Time \ To \ Recover \\ MLDT = Mean \ Logistics \ Delay \ Time \\ MAMDT = Mean \ Active \ Maintenance \ Down \ Time\\ MTBF = Mean \ Time \ Between \ Failure \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

=== MTBF ===

Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) depends upon the maintenance philosophy.

If a system is designed with both '''redundancy''' ''and'' '''automatic fault bypass''', then MTBF is the anticipated lifespan of the system if these features cover all possible failure modes (infinity for all practical purposes). Such systems will continue without noticeable interruption when these conditions are satisfied unless there are secondary failures. This is called active redundancy, which requires no maintenance to prevent mission failure. Active redundancy is required for systems that cannot be maintained, such as satellites.

If a system has no redundancy, then MTBF is the inverse of [[failure rate]], &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \frac{1}{MTBF}&lt;/math&gt;

Systems with spare parts that are energized but that lack automatic fault bypass are not actually redundant because human action is required to restore operation after every failure. This depends upon [[Condition-based maintenance]] and [[Planned Maintenance System]] support.

=== MTTR ===

Mean Time To Recover (MTTR) is the length of time required to restore operation to specification.

This includes three values.
* Mean Time To Discover
* Mean Time To Isolate
* Mean Time To Repair

Mean Time To Discover is the length of time that transpires between when a failure occurs and the system users become aware of the failure. There are two maintenance philosophies associated with Mean Time To Discover.
* [[Condition-based maintenance]] (CBM)
* [[Planned Maintenance System]] (PMS)

CBM works like your car where an oil indicator tells you when oil pressure is too low and a temperature indicator tells you when engine temperature is too high. There is zero time to discover a failure where an indicator is placed in front of a system operator.

PMS is required for silent failures that lack CBM. PMS works is periodic maintenance, like when you perform diagnostic tests on your car every 90 days (or 3,000 miles). A failure may occur any time during the 90 days, such as a broken light, but you will not become aware until you perform diagnostic test.

Mean Time To Discover is statistical when PMS is the dominant maintenance philosophy. For example, if a fault is discovered during PMS diagnostic procedure that is run every 10 days, the average fault duration will be 5 days. This creates a dependency between availability performance and labor costs. There is no such dependency associated with CBM.

Mean Time To Isolate is the average length of time required to identify a setting that needs to be adjusted or a component that needs to be replaced. This is dependent on documentation, training, and technical support. This tends to be less on systems that have CBM because users can begin with the list of items connected to the indicator used to notify users about the fault. This also tends to be less on fully documented systems.

Mean Time To Repair is the average length of time to restore operation. For mission critical systems, this is generally estimated by dividing time required to replace all parts by the number of replaceable parts.

=== MLDT ===

Mean Logistics Delay Time is the average time required to obtain replacement parts from the manufacturer and transport those parts to the work site.

=== MAMDT ===

Mean Active Maintenance Down Time is associated with [[Planned Maintenance System]] support philosophy. This is average amount of time while the system is not 100% operational because of diagnostic testing that requires down time.

For example, an automobile that requires 1 day of maintenance every 90 days has a Mean Active Maintenance Down Time of just over 1%.

This is separate from the type of down time associated with repair activities.

== Nines ==

Availability expectations are described in terms of '''nines'''.

The following table shows the anticipated down-time for different availabilities for a mission time of one year. This is the typical time-span used with commercial systems.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! 90% !! 99% !! 99.9% !! 99.99% !! 99.999% !! 99.9999%
|-
| 40 days || 4 days || 9 hours || 50 minutes || 5 minutes  || 30 seconds
|}

== Supportability ==

Systems that require maintenance are said to be supportable if they satisfy the following criteria.
* Adequate labor for PMS diagnostics or fault indicators for failure modes that lack PMS
* Access to manufacturing sources for replacement parts
* Sufficient resources to sustain access to replacement parts and maintenance labor (money, lodging, ...)
* Training and maintenance documentation suitable to restore operation
* Transportation services to deliver replacement parts

Systems that lack any of these requirements are said to be unsupportable.

== Mission Failure ==

Mission failure is the result of trying to use a system in its normal mode when it is not working.

:&lt;math&gt;P_F = 1 - A_o \begin{cases} P_F = Probability \ of \ Mission \ Failure \\ A_o = Operational \ Availability \end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

Apart from human error, mission failure results from the following causes.
* Lack of instrumentation for the fault in the form of an indicator suitable for CBM
* Failure after PMS diagnostic testing has been completed but before operation is attempted
* Lack of diagnostic PMS testing for any failure mode that lacks CBM

A '''Bachelor of Arts''' ('''BA''' or '''AB''', from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus artium}}'' or ''{{lang|la|artium baccalaureus}}'') is a [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for an [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] course or program in either the [[liberal arts education|liberal arts]], sciences, or both. Bachelor of Arts programs generally take three to four years depending on the country, institution, and specific specializations, majors, or minors. The word ''{{lang|la|baccalaureus}}'' (from the Latin ''{{lang|la|bacca}}'', a berry, and ''{{lang|la|laureus}}'', "of the [[bay laurel]]") should not be confused with ''{{lang|la|baccalaureatus}}'' (translatable as "gold-plated [[sceptre|scepter]]" by using the Latina ''{{lang|la|bacum}}'' and ''{{lang|la|aureatus}}''), which refers to the one- to two-year postgraduate ''Bachelor of Arts [[honors degree|with Honors]]'' degree (''{{lang|la|Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore}}'') in some countries.

[[Diploma]]s generally give the name of the institution, signatures of officials of the institution (generally the president or rector of the [[university]] as well as the secretary or dean of the component [[college]]), type of degree conferred, conferring authority, and location at which the degree is conferred. Diplomas generally are printed on high-quality [[paper]] or [[parchment]]; individual institutions set the preferred abbreviation for their degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvard.edu/degree-abbreviations An Explanation of Degree Abbreviations - Harvard University Commencement]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Bachelor of Arts is usually attained in four years in [[Afghanistan]], [[Lebanon]], [[Armenia]], [[Kenya]], [[Canada]], [[Greece]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Japan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Lithuania]], [[Nigeria]], [[Serbia]], [[Spain]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], [[Russia]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[South Korea]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Turkey]], [[Hong Kong]], the [[United States]], and most of the [[Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uta.fi/FAST/US5/REF/gpa.html FAST-US-5 United States Education Reference File&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Degree attainment generally takes three years in nearly all of the [[European Union]] and [[Albania]], [[Australia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[New Zealand]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Singapore]], [[the Caribbean]], [[South Africa]], [[Switzerland]] and the Province of [[Quebec]] in [[Canada]]. In [[Pakistan]], the Bachelor of Arts can also be attained within two years as an ''[[external degree]].''

==Australia, Canada, India, Nepal, New Zealand, South Africa==
In colleges and universities in Australia, New Zealand, [[Nepal]] and South Africa, the BA degree can be taken over three years of full-time study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144 Bachelor of Arts degrees] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401072859/http://cass.anu.edu.au/node/144 |date=2010-04-01 }}, [[Australian National University]]&lt;/ref&gt; Students must pursue at least one [[academic major|major]] area of study, and units from that subject are usually studied in each year, though sometimes students may choose to complete upper-level classes in the same year and as a result, can leave space for elective subjects from a different field. At some universities students may choose to pursue a second major; alternatively, the remainder of the degree is taken up with a minor area of study (in the first two years) and other individual or stream-based subjects make up the degree.

Unlike in other countries, students do not receive an overall grade for their Bachelor of Arts degree with varying levels of honours ("honours" is a distinction but not part of the degree itself). Qualified students may be admitted, after they have achieved their (general) Bachelor's program with a high overall grade point average, to a further one year Bachelor (with) Honours degree program (''(with) Honours'' is part of the degree itself). Thus, to achieve a Bachelor (with) Honours degree (abbr. e.g. BA (Hons.) or BA hons.), an extra "[[postgraduate]]" year and a high research honour's thesis must be completed; see [[Honours Degree]]s. A student who holds a (with) Honours degree is eligible for direct entry to either a Doctorate (Ph.D.) or a very high research master's degree program.

Education in [[Canada]] is controlled by the Provinces and can be very different depending on the province in Canada.  Canadian universities typically offer a 4-year Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degrees. In many universities and colleges, Bachelor of Arts degrees are differentiated either as Bachelors of Arts or as honours Bachelor of Arts degree. The term "Honours" is an academic distinction, which indicates that students must achieve their Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall grade point average; in addition, some programs may require more education than non-honours programs.

The honours degrees are sometimes designated with the abbreviation in brackets of '(Hon(s))'. It should not be confused with the consecutive [[honours degree|Bachelor of Arts degree "with Honours"]], Latin "Baccalaureatus in Artibus Cum Honore", abbr. 'BA hon.' ''de jure'' without brackets and with a dot. It is a "postgraduate" degree. Going back in history, a three-year Bachelor of Arts degree (also known e.g. in Québec as grade de bachelier ès arts) was also called a ''pass degree'' or ''general degree''.

A student who first achieves a general Bachelor of Arts degree with a sufficiently high overall average may be admitted to a "postgraduate" Baccalaureatus cum Honore degree in the same field; it requires a minimum of one year but may also take longer; it typically does not exceed two years. Students may be required to undertake a long high-quality research empirical thesis (Honours Seminar Thesis) combined with a selection of courses from the relevant field of studies. The consecutive B. cum Honore degree is essential if students ultimate goal is to study towards a two- or three-year very high research master's degree qualification. A student holding a Baccalaureatus Cum Honore degree also may choose to complete a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) program without the requirement to first complete a master's degree. Over the years, in some universities certain Baccalaureatus cum Honore programs have been changed to corresponding master's degrees.

In general, in all four countries, the B.A. degree is the standard required for entry into  a [[Master of Arts|master's]] programme. In science, a BA hons degree is generally a prerequisite for entrance to a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] program or a very-high-research-activity master's programme. As such, for example the UK awarded ''honours'' are designed and should not be confused with Canadian, Australian, New Zealand and South African awarded BA hons/BA (Hons) degree.

For further clarification, in other countries the so-called ''honours'' bachelor may not be an actual degree, but the name of a (vocational) programme which can be completed through specified course work, a high grade average, and the completion of possibly a short paper or project; students who completed such a ''honours'' BA programme sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' after the degree abbreviation without a space, in parentheses and after the 'Hon(s)' without a dot, for example 'B.A.(Hon)'. The 3 and 4 year B.A. degree is also accepted for entry into graduate professional programmes such as [[LLB#Structure of LL.B. programmes|law]] or a [[M.B.A.|Master of Business Administration]] program.

==Netherlands / Europe==
In the [[Netherlands]], the Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degrees were introduced in 2002. Until then there was a single program which led to the [[doctorandus]] degree. This comprised the same course load as the Bachelor and Master programs combined. The title ''doctorandus'' was used in almost all fields of study; other titles were used for legal studies (''meester'', Dutch for master, abbreviated ''Mr.'') and engineering (''[[ingenieur]]''). Those who had already started the doctorandus program could, on completing it, opt for the doctorandus degree (entitling them to use "Drs." in front of their name), or could use the master's degree (post-nominal letters) in accordance with the new standard.
A similar practice has been introduced in other EU countries, according to the [[Bologna Process]].

==Germany==
In Germany, university-level education usually happens in either a ''Universität'' (plural: ''Universitäten'') or a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (plural: ''Fachhochschulen''); both can be referred to as a ''Hochschule'', which is the generic term in Germany for all institutions awarding academic degrees. Fachhochschule is often translated as "University of Applied Sciences". Universitäten place greater emphasis on fundamental science and theoretical background, while Fachhochschulen are generally designed with a focus on teaching professional skills. Degrees earned at Universitäten and Fachhochschulen are legally equivalent.

In Germany, the B.A. normally lasts between 3 and 3 ½ years – 6 or 7 semesters – and is awarded after the student earns between 180 and 210 [[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]].

==United Kingdom and Ireland==
{{Main|British undergraduate degree classification}}
In the [[United Kingdom]] (excluding [[Scotland]]) and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], the first degree course normally lasts three years, but nomenclature varies: 19th-century and later universities usually distinguish between arts and sciences subjects by awarding either a B.A. or B.Sc. degree. However, some older or [[ancient universities]], such as [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} and [[University of Dublin|Dublin]] traditionally award B.A.s to undergraduates having completed the final examinations, e.g. Part II [[Tripos]] (Cambridge), Final Honour Schools (Oxford), Moderatorship (Dublin), in most subjects including the sciences. Some new [[plate glass university|plate glass universities]] established in the 1960s, such as [[University of York|York]] and [[Lancaster University|Lancaster]] originally followed the practice of Oxford and Cambridge by awarding B.A.s in all subjects, but have since changed to awarding B.Sc. degrees in science subjects. At Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin the degree of [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] can be claimed, usually 21 terms after [[matriculation]]. For many centuries, the bachelor's degree was an intermediate step and was awarded for much of the work carried out in later times at secondary schools. The names of the final secondary school exams in France and Spain (and increasingly in the UK—the [[International Baccalaureate]]) come from this: le [[Baccalauréat]] and el ''Bachillerato'', respectively.

The [[Ancient Universities of Scotland]] award a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree to humanities or arts graduates, but a B.Sc. to science graduates. This course takes four years for an honours degree and three for an ordinar.  In Scotland, it is possible to opt to take an ordinary degree rather than this simply ranking below a third class honours (for example, B.A. with distinction, merit or pass).

A Bachelor of Arts is entitled to the designation B.A. for an ordinary/pass degree and B.A. (Hons) for an honours degree. Students who completed an honours B.A. sometimes style themselves by '(Hon)' or '(Hons)' after the degree abbreviation in parentheses. An honours degree is always awarded in one of four classes depending upon the marks gained in the final assessments and examinations. The top students are awarded a first-class degree, followed by an upper second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:1), a lower second-class degree (usually referred to as a 2:2), and those with the lowest marks gain a third-class degree. An ordinary or unclassified degree (which does not give the graduate the right to add '(Hons)') may be awarded if a student has completed the full honours degree course but has not obtained the total required passes sufficient to merit a third-class honours degree. Typically these degrees lack the last year requirement of a dissertation.

The '''Buddhapad Hoard''' or ''Buddam Hoard'' is a large cache of [[Buddhist]] sculptures found near the town of [[Buddam, India|Buddam]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]], southern India. Since 1905, it has formed an important part of the [[British Museum]]'s South Asian collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=40193&amp;plaA=40193-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Dating from 6th-8th centuries AD, the style of craftsmanship fuses the northern influences of the [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] with the southern traditions of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], which in turn greatly influenced Buddhist art in South East Asia in subsequent centuries.

==Discovery and original ownership==
The hoard was discovered in the late nineteenth century and it was described by the colonial historian [[Robert Sewell (historian)|Robert Sewell]] in 1895.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baptiste|first1=John Guy ; with essays by Pierre|last2=Becker|first2=Lawrence|last3=Bellina|first3=Bérénice|last4=Brown|first4=Robert L.|last5=Carò|first5=Federico|last6=Chirapravati|first6=Pattaratorn|last7=Douglas|first7=Janet G.|last8=Griffiths|first8=Arlo|last9=Indradjaya|first9=Agustijanto|last10=Lien|first10=Le Thi|last11=Manguin|first11=Pierre-Yves|last12=Murphy|first12=Stephen A.|last13=O'Connor|first13=Ariel|last14=Skilling|first14=Peter|last15=Stargardt|first15=Janice|last16=Strahan|first16=Donna|last17=Lwin|first17=U Thein|last18=Wade|first18=Geoff|last19=Kyaing|first19=U Win|last20=Woodward,|first20=Hiram|last21=Zéphir|first21=Thierry|title=Lost kingdoms : Hindu-Buddhist sculpture of early Southeast Asia|date=2014|isbn=1588395243|page=105|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1588395243|accessdate=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artefacts was subsequently donated by the [[Secretary of State for India]] to the [[British Museum]] in 1905. Given the religious nature of the sculptures, the cache may have originally formed part of a ritual deposit from a Buddhist temple or [[monastery]].

==Description==
The 6th-8th century hoard&lt;ref name=book/&gt; is composed of fifteen bronze [[Buddhist]] images, the vast majority of which are either statuettes or parts of small figures. There are three relatively intact standing statuettes of the Buddha (the largest of which is 38&amp;nbsp;cm high), 4 bronze arms, two bases for standing figures (one of which has a [[Brahmi]] inscription), a representation of the god [[Tirthankara]], two small Buddha heads, two fragmentary figures of [[Parsvanatha]] and a bronze model of a [[stupa]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15343">Starting in the early 1990s, [[James F. Moore]] originated the [[strategic planning]] concept of a '''business ecosystem''', now widely adopted in the [[high tech]] community. The basic definition comes from Moore's book, ''[[The Death of Competition: Leadership and Strategy in the Age of Business Ecosystems]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The origins of the concept==
The concept first appeared in Moore's May/June 1993 ''[[Harvard Business Review]]'' article, titled "Predators and Prey: A New Ecology of Competition", and won the [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey]] Award for article of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:9vCCtUPpvH8J:www.isc.hbs.edu/mckinsey.pdf+james+moore+1993+mckinsey+award&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESi5p3-FjaIXFtwHhFgLk7zc8HukKsFKCUhk17KyhXsWjl2ZBPZOiATTd8LJWia5pJCZRj4xKsTs09f6p0XeZxJZaE3IJFQ5fhcsM9aZEgs6ahQVkQQm_JuL7rsOA_h49yV403Cf&amp;sig=AHIEtbQsPjXx1J8LDyvOVZQBtu41LnVm1w|page=2|title=McKinsey Award Winners for Best ''HBR'' Articles|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore defined "business ecosystem" as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
An economic community supported by a foundation of interacting organizations and individuals—the organisms of the business world. The economic community produces goods and services of value to customers, who are themselves members of the ecosystem. The member organisms also include suppliers, lead producers, competitors, and other stakeholders. Over time, they [[coevolve]] their capabilities and roles, and tend to align themselves with the directions set by one or more central companies. Those companies holding leadership roles may change over time, but the function of ecosystem leader is valued by the community because it enables members to move toward shared visions to align their investments, and to find mutually supportive roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moore used several ecological [[metaphor]]s, suggesting that the firm is embedded in a (business) environment, that it needs to coevolve with other companies, and that “the particular [[Ecological niche|niche]] a business occupies is challenged by newly arriving species.”&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Moore|1996|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that companies need to become proactive in developing mutually beneficial ("[[symbiotic]]") relationships with customers, suppliers, and even competitors.

Using ecological metaphors to describe business structure and operations is increasingly common especially within the field of information technology (IT). For example, [[J. Bradford DeLong]], a professor of economics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], has written that "business ecosystems" describe “the pattern of launching new technologies that has emerged from [[Silicon Valley]]”.&lt;ref name=delong1&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Cohen|DeLong|Zysman|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defines business ecology as “a more productive set of processes for developing and commercializing new technologies” that is characterized by the “rapid prototyping, short product-development cycles, early test marketing, options-based compensation, venture funding, early corporate independence”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 6 &amp; 4, respectively}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeLong also has expressed that the new way is likely to endure “because it's a better business ecology than the legendarily lugubrious model refined at [[Xerox PARC|Xerox Parc]]—a more productive set of processes for rapidly developing and commercializing new technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|DeLong|2000|loc=para. 6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mangrove Software,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Mangrove|2001|loc=para. 1}}: “(t)he interaction and correlation of economic conditions, technology, customers, employees, corporate partners, shareholders, and competitors forming the environment under which a business operates”.&lt;/ref&gt; The Montague Institute,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Montague|1993|loc=para. 1}}: “interacting systems consisting of companies, their customers and suppliers, and other players in the business environment”&lt;/ref&gt; Kenneth L. Kraemer, director of the [[University of California, Irvine]]’s Center for Research on Information Technology and Organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Kraemer|1999|loc=para. 11}}: “It is the applications that firms buy or create themselves that bring value-added to the firm and to its business ecology of customers, suppliers and business partners”.&lt;/ref&gt; and Stephen Abram, Vice President of Micromedia, Ltd.,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abram|2000|loc=para. 4}}: has asserted that the Web is “maturing as a business ecology”&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Gruber, co-founder and CTO of Intraspect Software,&lt;ref name=gruber&gt;{{
harvnb|Gruber|loc=para. 4}}: “Imagine that companies are like organisms in an evolutionary landscape”&lt;/ref&gt; Vinod K. Dar, Managing Director of Dar &amp; Company,&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Dar|1999|loc=para. 1}}: “Evolution on the Internet is no different from physical evolution but with vastly compressed life cycles and faster genetic mutation”.&lt;/ref&gt; have all advocated this approach.

==Industries==
Gruber explains that over a century ago, [[Ford Motor Company|Ford Motors]] did well using methods of mass production, an assembly line, and [[insourcing]]. However, Ford began to outsource its production “[w]hen the ecology evolved.” Gruber (n.d.) has stated that such evolution in the ecology of the business world is “punctuated now and then by radical changes in the environment” and that “globalization and the Internet are the equivalents of large-scale climate change. Globalization is eliminating the traditional advantages of the large corporation: access to capital, access to markets, and economies of scale”.&lt;ref name=gruber/&gt;

The [[application service provider]] (ASP) industry is moving toward relationship networks and focusing on core competencies. “According to the gospel of [[Cisco Systems]], companies inclined to exist together within an “ecosystem” facilitate the imminence of Internet-based application delivery”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Kaminsky|2000|loc=para. 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Books also use natural systems metaphors without discussing the interfaces between human business and biological ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Baskin|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another work defines business ecology as “a new field for sustainable organizational management and design,” one “that is based on the principle that organizations, as living organisms, are most successful when their development and behavior are aligned with their core purpose and values – what we call “social DNA’”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|pp=xii-xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for companies to attend to ecological health is indicated by the following: “Business ecology is based on the elegant structure and principles of natural systems. It recognizes that to develop healthy business ecosystems, leaders and their organizations must see themselves, and their environments, through an “ecological lens”.&lt;ref&gt;{{
harvnb|Abe|Dempsey|Bassett|1998|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological ecosystems==
Some environmentalists have used "business ecosystems" as a way to talk about environmental issues as they relate to business rather than as a metaphor to describe the increasing complexity of relationships among companies. According to Townsend, business ecology is the study of the reciprocal relationship between business and organisms and their environments. The goal of this "business ecology" is sustainability through the complete ecological synchronization and integration of a business with the sites that it inhabits, uses, and affects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Townsend|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other environmentalists believe that the ecosystem metaphor is just a way for business to appear 'Green'. According to author [[Alan Marshall (New Zealand author)|Alan Marshall]], the metaphor is used to make out that somehow business operates using natural principles which should be left to run without interference by governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Nature: Wholeness and Disintegration in Ecology and Science|last = Marshall|first = Alan|publisher = Imperial College Press|year = 2002|isbn = 9781860943300|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed|date=February 2016}}

'''CRISPR''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|s|p|ər}}) ('''clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats''') is a family of [[DNA]] sequences found within the [[genome]]s of [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] organisms such as bacteria and [[archaea]].&lt;ref name="pmid25574773" /&gt; These sequences are derived from DNA fragments from viruses that have previously infected the prokaryote and are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar viruses during subsequent infections.

== History ==
=== Repeated sequences ===
The discovery of clustered DNA repeats occurred independently in three parts of the world. The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from [[Osaka University]] researcher [[Yoshizumi Ishino]] and his colleagues in 1987. They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR together with the ''[[Inhibitor of apoptosis|iap]]'' gene, the target of interest. The organization of the repeats was unusual because repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively along DNA.&lt;ref name="Ishino1987"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishino Y, Shinagawa H, Makino K, Amemura M, Nakata A | title = Nucleotide sequence of the iap gene, responsible for alkaline phosphatase isozyme conversion in Escherichia coli, and identification of the gene product | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 169 | issue = 12 | pages = 5429–33 | date = December 1987 | pmid = 3316184 | pmc = 213968 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hsu2014" /&gt; They studied the relation of "iap" to the bacterium ''[[E. coli]]''. The function of the interrupted clustered repeats was not known at the time.

In 1993, researchers of ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted direct repeats (DR) in this bacterium. These researchers recognized the diversity of the DR-intervening sequences among different strains of ''M. tuberculosis''&lt;ref name="Soolingen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Soolingen D, de Haas PE, Hermans PW, Groenen PM, van Embden JD | title = Comparison of various repetitive DNA elements as genetic markers for strain differentiation and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis | journal = Journal of Clinical Microbiology | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 1987–95 | date = August 1993 | pmid = 7690367 | pmc = 265684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and used this property to design a typing method that was named ''spoligotyping'', which is still in use today.&lt;ref name="Groenen1993"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Groenen PM, Bunschoten AE, van Soolingen D, van Embden JD | title = Nature of DNA polymorphism in the direct repeat cluster of Mycobacterium tuberculosis; application for strain differentiation by a novel typing method | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 5 | pages = 1057–65 | date = December 1993 | pmid = 7934856 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.1993.tb00976.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mojica2016&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mojica FJ, Montoliu L |title=On the Origin of CRISPR-Cas Technology: From Prokaryotes to Mammals |journal=Trends in Microbiology |volume=24 |issue=10 |pages=811–20 |year=2016 |pmid=27401123 |doi=10.1016/j.tim.2016.06.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, repeats were observed in the archaeal organisms of ''[[Haloferax]]'' and ''[[Haloarcula]]'' species, and their function was studied by [[Francisco Mojica]] at the [[University of Alicante]] in Spain. Although his hypothesis turned out to be wrong, Mojica's supervisor surmised at the time that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in ''[[Haloferax volcanii]]''. Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time.&lt;ref name=Mojica2016 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mojica2016b&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Rodriguez-Valera F |title=The discovery of CRISPR in archaea and bacteria |journal=The FEBS Journal |volume=283 |issue=17 |pages=3162–9 |year=2016 |pmid=27234458 |doi=10.1111/febs.13766 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, Mojica performed a survey of scientific literature and one of his students performed a search in published genomes with a program devised by himself. They identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes as belonging to the same family.&lt;ref name="Mojica_2000"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, Soria E, Juez G | title = Biological significance of a family of regularly spaced repeats in the genomes of Archaea, Bacteria and mitochondria | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 36 | issue = 1 | pages = 244–6 | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10760181 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2000.01838.x |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Mojica and Ruud Jansen, who was searching for additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to alleviate the confusion stemming from the numerous acronyms used to describe the sequences in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name=Mojica2016b /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barrangou | first1 = Rodolphe | last2 = van der Oost | first2 = John | name-list-format = vanc | title = CRISPR-Cas Systems : RNA-mediated Adaptive Immunity in Bacteria and Archaea | date = 2013 | publisher = Springer | location = Heidelberg  | isbn = 978-3-642-34656-9 | page = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Tang, et al. showed evidence that CRISPR repeat regions from the genome of [[Archaeoglobus fulgidus]] were transcribed into long RNA molecules that were subsequently processed into unit-length small RNAs, plus some longer forms of 2, 3, or more spacer-repeat units.&lt;ref name="pmid25994611"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Charpentier E, Richter H, van der Oost J, White MF | title = Biogenesis pathways of RNA guides in archaeal and bacterial CRISPR-Cas adaptive immunity | journal = FEMS Microbiology Reviews | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 428–41 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25994611 | pmc = 5965381 | doi = 10.1093/femsre/fuv023 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CRISPR-associated systems ===
A major addition to the understanding of CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by a set of homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems or ''cas'' genes. Four ''cas'' genes (''cas'' 1 - 4) were initially recognized. The Cas proteins showed [[helicase]] and [[nuclease]] motifs, suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci.&lt;ref name="pmid11952905"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jansen R, Embden JD, Gaastra W, Schouls LM | title = Identification of genes that are associated with DNA repeats in prokaryotes | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 43 | issue = 6 | pages = 1565–75 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11952905 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2958.2002.02839.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this publication the acronym CRISPR was coined as the universal name of this pattern. However, the CRISPR function remained enigmatic.

In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from [[phage]] DNA and [[extrachromosomal DNA]] such as [[plasmids]].&lt;ref name="pmid15758212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pourcel C, Salvignol G, Vergnaud G | title = CRISPR elements in Yersinia pestis acquire new repeats by preferential uptake of bacteriophage DNA, and provide additional tools for evolutionary studies | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 3 | pages = 653–63 | date = March 2005 | pmid = 15758212 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.27437-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15791728"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mojica FJ, Díez-Villaseñor C, García-Martínez J, Soria E | title = Intervening sequences of regularly spaced prokaryotic repeats derive from foreign genetic elements | journal = Journal of Molecular Evolution | volume = 60 | issue = 2 | pages = 174–82 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15791728 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1007/s00239-004-0046-3 | bibcode = 2005JMolE..60..174M }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid16079334"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolotin A, Quinquis B, Sorokin A, Ehrlich SD | title = Clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats (CRISPRs) have spacers of extrachromosomal origin | journal = Microbiology | volume = 151 | issue = Pt 8 | pages = 2551–61 | date = August 2005 | pmid = 16079334 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.28048-0 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt; In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously tried to attack the cell.

The first publication&lt;ref name="pmid15791728" /&gt; proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by the researchers at the [[University of Alicante]], predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the [[RNA interference]] system used by eukaryotic cells. Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.&lt;ref name=Makarova2006&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Makarova KS, Grishin NV, Shabalina SA, Wolf YI, Koonin EV | title = A putative RNA-interference-based immune system in prokaryotes: computational analysis of the predicted enzymatic machinery, functional analogies with eukaryotic RNAi, and hypothetical mechanisms of action | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 1 | issue =  | pages = 7 | date = March 2006 | pmid = 16545108 | pmc = 1462988 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-1-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity. In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an adaptive immune system was published.&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt; A CRISPR region in ''[[Streptococcus thermophilus]]'' acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage.

That year Marraffini and Sontheimer indeed confirmed that a CRISPR sequence of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis|S. epidermidis]]'' targeted DNA and not RNA to prevent [[conjugation (genetics)|conjugation]]. This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in ''[[Pyrococcus furiosus]]''.&lt;ref name=Hsu2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marraffini2015/&gt; A 2010 study showed that CRISPR-Cas cuts both strands of phage and plasmid DNA in ''S. thermophilus''.&lt;ref name=Garneau2010&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Garneau JE, Dupuis MÈ, Villion M, Romero DA, Barrangou R, Boyaval P, Fremaux C, Horvath P, Magadán AH, Moineau S | display-authors = 6 | title = The CRISPR/Cas bacterial immune system cleaves bacteriophage and plasmid DNA | journal = Nature | volume = 468 | issue = 7320 | pages = 67–71 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 21048762 | doi = 10.1038/nature09523 | bibcode = 2010Natur.468...67G | citeseerx = 10.1.1.451.9645 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas9 ===
Researchers studied a simpler CRISPR system from ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]'' that relies on the protein [[Cas9]]. The Cas9 endonuclease is a four-component system that includes two small RNA molecules named CRISPR RNA (crRNA) and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="Barrangou2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Barrangou R | title = Diversity of CRISPR-Cas immune systems and molecular machines | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 16 | issue =  | pages = 247 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26549499 | pmc = 4638107 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-015-0816-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jennifer Doudna]] and [[Emmanuelle Charpentier]] re-engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a "single-guide RNA" that, when combined with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA. By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, the artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid22745249" /&gt; Another group of collaborators comprising [[Virginijus Šikšnys]] together with Gasiūnas, Barrangou and Horvath showed that Cas9 from the ''S. thermophilus'' CRISPR system can also be reprogrammed to target a site of their choosing by changing the sequence of its crRNA. These advances fueled efforts to edit genomes with the modified CRISPR-Cas9 system.&lt;ref name="Mojica2016"/&gt;

=== Cpf1 ===
In 2015, the nuclease Cpf1 was characterized in the [[CRISPR/Cpf1]] system of the bacterium ''[[Francisella novicida]]''.&lt;ref name="pmid26422227"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zetsche B, Gootenberg JS, Abudayyeh OO, Slaymaker IM, Makarova KS, Essletzbichler P, Volz SE, Joung J, van der Oost J, Regev A, Koonin EV, Zhang F | display-authors = 6 | title = Cpf1 is a single RNA-guided endonuclease of a class 2 CRISPR-Cas system | journal = Cell | volume = 163 | issue = 3 | pages = 759–71 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26422227 | pmc = 4638220 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27096362"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fonfara I, Richter H, Bratovič M, Le Rhun A, Charpentier E | title = The CRISPR-associated DNA-cleaving enzyme Cpf1 also processes precursor CRISPR RNA | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7600 | pages = 517–21 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27096362 | doi = 10.1038/nature17945 | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..517F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name, from a [[TIGRFAMs]] [[protein family]] definition built in 2012, reflects the prevalence of its CRISPR-Cas subtype in the Prevotella and Francisella lineages. Cpf1 showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the 'blunt' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a 'T rich' PAM (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9) and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting. By contrast Cas9 requires both crRNA and a [[Trans-activating crRNA|transactivating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).

These differences may give Cpf1 some advantages over Cas9. For example, Cpf1's small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9's sgRNAs. As well, the sticky 5' overhangs left by Cpf1 can be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional Restriction Enzyme cloning.&lt;ref name="PMC5316869"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kim H, Kim ST, Ryu J, Kang BC, Kim JS, and Kim SG | title = CRISPR/Cpf1-mediated DNA-free plant genome editing | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 8 | issue = 14406 | pages = 14406 | date = February 2017 | pmc = 5316869 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms14406 | pmid=28205546| bibcode = 2017NatCo...814406K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Cpf1 cleaves DNA 18-23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site. This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cpf1 enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage. By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in indel mutations which destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting. In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Cpf1 Nuclease|url = https://www.abmgood.com/marketing/knowledge_base/CRISPR_Cas9_Introduction_Part7.php#ATSPC|website = abmgood.com|accessdate = 2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes ===

Small clusters of ''cas'' genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays. Collectively the 93 ''cas'' genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins. 11 of the 35 families form the ''cas'' core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9. A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the ''cas'' core.&lt;ref name="Makarova2015" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes. Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids. Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose. Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI.&lt;ref name="Wright2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wright AV, Nuñez JK, Doudna JA | title = Biology and Applications of CRISPR Systems: Harnessing Nature's Toolbox for Genome Engineering | journal = Cell | volume = 164 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 29–44 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26771484 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2015.12.035 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 6 system types are divided into 19 subtypes.&lt;ref name="Westra2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Westra | first1 = Edze R. | last2 = Dowling | first2 = Andrea J. | last3 = Broniewski | first3 = Jenny M. | last4 = van Houte | first4 = Stineke | name-list-format = vanc | title = Evolution and Ecology of CRISPR | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | date = November 2016 | volume = 47 | issue = 1 |pages = 307–331 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-121415-032428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a "signature gene" found almost exclusively in the category.

== Mechanism ==
[[File:The Stages of CRISPR immunity.svg|thumb|left|upright=2|The stages of CRISPR immunity for each of the three major types of adaptive immunity. (1) Acquisition begins by recognition of invading DNA by [[Cas1]] and Cas2 and cleavage of a protospacer. (2) The protospacer is ligated to the direct repeat adjacent to the leader sequence and (3) single strand extension repairs the CRISPR and duplicates the direct repeat. The crRNA processing and interference stages occur differently in each of the three major CRISPR systems. (4) The primary CRISPR transcript is cleaved by cas genes to produce crRNAs. (5) In type I systems Cas6e/Cas6f cleave at the junction of ssRNA and dsRNA formed by hairpin loops in the direct repeat. Type II systems use a trans-activating (tracr) RNA to form dsRNA, which is cleaved by [[Cas9]] and RNaseIII. Type III systems use a Cas6 homolog that does not require hairpin loops in the direct repeat for cleavage. (6) In type II and type III systems secondary trimming is performed at either the 5’ or 3’ end to produce mature crRNAs. (7) Mature crRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form interference complexes. (8) In type I and type II systems, interactions between the protein and PAM sequence are required for degradation of invading DNA. Type III systems do not require a PAM for successful degradation and in type III-A systems basepairing occurs between the crRNA and mRNA rather than the DNA, targeted by type III-B systems.]]

CRISPR-Cas immunity is a natural process of bacteria and archaea. CRISPR-Cas prevents bacteriophage infection, [[conjugation (genetics)|conjugation]] and [[transformation (genetics)#Natural transformation|natural transformation]] by degrading foreign nucleic acids that enter the cell.&lt;ref name="Marraffini2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA | title = CRISPR-Cas immunity in prokaryotes | journal = Nature | volume = 526 | issue = 7571 | pages = 55–61 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26432244 | doi = 10.1038/nature15386 | bibcode = 2015Natur.526...55M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spacer acquisition ===
When a [[microbe]] is invaded by a [[virus]], the first stage of the immune response is to capture viral DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer. [[Cas1]] and Cas2 are found in both types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition. Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of [[cas1]] or cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.&lt;ref name="pmid19120484"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aliyari R, Ding SW | title = RNA-based viral immunity initiated by the Dicer family of host immune receptors | journal = Immunological Reviews | volume = 227 | issue = 1 | pages = 176–88 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19120484 | pmc = 2676720 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-065X.2008.00722.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23696746"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dugar G, Herbig A, Förstner KU, Heidrich N, Reinhardt R, Nieselt K, Sharma CM | title = High-resolution transcriptome maps reveal strain-specific regulatory features of multiple Campylobacter jejuni isolates | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 9 | issue = 5 | pages = e1003495 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23696746 | pmc = 3656092 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1003495 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22160698"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hatoum-Aslan A, Maniv I, Marraffini LA | title = Mature clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeats RNA (crRNA) length is measured by a ruler mechanism anchored at the precursor processing site | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 52 | pages = 21218–22 | date = December 2011 | pmid = 22160698 | pmc = 3248500 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1112832108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10821218H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22402487"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yosef I, Goren MG, Qimron U | title = Proteins and DNA elements essential for the CRISPR adaptation process in Escherichia coli | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 40 | issue = 12 | pages = 5569–76 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22402487 | pmc = 3384332 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gks216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Swarts DC, Mosterd C, van Passel MW, Brouns SJ | title = CRISPR interference directs strand specific spacer acquisition | journal = PLOS One | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = e35888 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22558257 | pmc = 3338789 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0035888 | bibcode = 2012PLoSO...735888S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nt of the protospacer.

However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position.&lt;ref name="pmid23403393" /&gt; It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.

==== Insertion variants ====
Analysis of ''[[Sulfolobus solfataricus]]'' CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion, as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.&lt;ref name="pmid22834906" /&gt;

Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage. The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of ''E. coli''. A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer. This ‘priming’ requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other. Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22771574" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt; This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.&lt;ref name="pmid22781758" /&gt;

=== Biogenesis ===
CRISPR-RNA (crRNA), which later guides the Cas nuclease to the target during the interference step, must be generated from the CRISPR sequence. The crRNA is initially transcribed as part of a single long transcript encompassing much of the CRISPR array.&lt;ref name="pmid20125085" /&gt; This transcript is then cleaved by Cas proteins to form crRNAs. The mechanism to produce crRNAs differs among CRISPR/Cas systems. In type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops&lt;ref name="pmid21572444"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gesner EM, Schellenberg MJ, Garside EL, George MM, Macmillan AM | title = Recognition and maturation of effector RNAs in a CRISPR interference pathway | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 688–92 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572444 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21572442"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sashital DG, Jinek M, Doudna JA | title = An RNA-induced conformational change required for CRISPR RNA cleavage by the endoribonuclease Cse3 | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 6 | pages = 680–7 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21572442 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20829488"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haurwitz RE, Jinek M, Wiedenheft B, Zhou K, Doudna JA | title = Sequence- and structure-specific RNA processing by a CRISPR endonuclease | journal = Science | volume = 329 | issue = 5997 | pages = 1355–8 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20829488 | pmc = 3133607 | doi = 10.1126/science.1192272 | bibcode = 2010Sci...329.1355H }}&lt;/ref&gt; created by the pairing of identical repeats that flank the crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kunin V, Sorek R, Hugenholtz P | title = Evolutionary conservation of sequence and secondary structures in CRISPR repeats | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = R61 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17442114 | pmc = 1896005 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2007-8-4-r61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These Cas proteins cleave the longer transcript at the edge of the paired region, leaving a single crRNA along with a small remnant of the paired repeat region.

Type III systems also use Cas6, however their repeats do not produce stem-loops.

Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage. Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a [[trans-activating crRNA]] (tracrRNA).&lt;ref name="pmid23696746" /&gt; Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs. Unlike the other two systems the crRNA does not contain the full spacer, which is instead truncated at one end.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt;

CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids. CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system.&lt;ref name="pmid19095942" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Garneau2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19120484" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22558257" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21646539"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Semenova E, Jore MM, Datsenko KA, Semenova A, Westra ER, Wanner B, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ, Severinov K | display-authors = 6 | title = Interference by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) RNA is governed by a seed sequence | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 108 | issue = 25 | pages = 10098–103 | date = June 2011 | pmid = 21646539 | pmc = 3121866 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1104144108 | bibcode = 2011PNAS..10810098S }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21166892"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gudbergsdottir S, Deng L, Chen Z, Jensen JV, Jensen LR, She Q, Garrett RA | title = Dynamic properties of the Sulfolobus CRISPR/Cas and CRISPR/Cmr systems when challenged with vector-borne viral and plasmid genes and protospacers | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 79 | issue = 1 | pages = 35–49 | date = January 2011 | pmid = 21166892 | pmc = 3025118 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2010.07452.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21385233"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Manica A, Zebec Z, Teichmann D, Schleper C | title = In vivo activity of CRISPR-mediated virus defence in a hyperthermophilic archaeon | journal = Molecular Microbiology | volume = 80 | issue = 2 | pages = 481–91 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21385233 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2958.2011.07586.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins bound to a single crRNA.&lt;ref name="pmid21460843"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jore MM, Lundgren M, van Duijn E, Bultema JB, Westra ER, Waghmare SP, Wiedenheft B, Pul U, Wurm R, Wagner R, Beijer MR, Barendregt A, Zhou K, Snijders AP, Dickman MJ, Doudna JA, Boekema EJ, Heck AJ, van der Oost J, Brouns SJ | display-authors = 6 | title = Structural basis for CRISPR RNA-guided DNA recognition by Cascade | journal = Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 5 | pages = 529–36 | date = May 2011 | pmid = 21460843 | doi = 10.1038/nsmb.2019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21938068"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wiedenheft B, Lander GC, Zhou K, Jore MM, Brouns SJ, van der Oost J, Doudna JA, Nogales E | title = Structures of the RNA-guided surveillance complex from a bacterial immune system | journal = Nature | volume = 477 | issue = 7365 | pages = 486–9 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21938068 | doi = 10.1038/nature10402 | bibcode = 2011Natur.477..486W | pmc=4165517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interference ===
During the interference stage in type I systems the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing. In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.

Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, [[Cas9]], for the interference step.&lt;ref name="pmid22949671" /&gt; [[Cas9]] requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleaves DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains. Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems. However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).

Type III systems, like type I require six or seven Cas proteins binding to crRNAs.&lt;ref name="pmid22227115"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang J, Rouillon C, Kerou M, Reeks J, Brugger K, Graham S, Reimann J, Cannone G, Liu H, Albers SV, Naismith JH, Spagnolo L, White MF | title = Structure and mechanism of the CMR complex for CRISPR-mediated antiviral immunity | journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 303–13 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 22227115 | pmc = 3381847 | doi = 10.1016/j.molcel.2011.12.013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hale CR, Zhao P, Olson S, Duff MO, Graveley BR, Wells L, Terns RM, Terns MP | title = RNA-guided RNA cleavage by a CRISPR RNA-Cas protein complex | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 5 | pages = 945–56 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19945378 | pmc = 2951265 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.07.040 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type III systems analysed from ''S. solfataricus'' and ''P. furiosus'' both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome,&lt;ref name="pmid23320564" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19945378" /&gt; which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes.&lt;ref name="pmid22337052" /&gt;

The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems. Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends. It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marraffini LA, Sontheimer EJ | title = Self versus non-self discrimination during CRISPR RNA-directed immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 463 | issue = 7280 | pages = 568–71 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20072129 | pmc = 2813891 | doi = 10.1038/nature08703 | bibcode = 2010Natur.463..568M }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as [[Restriction enzyme#Type V|type V restriction enzymes]].

The cas genes in the adaptor and effector modules of the CRISPR-Cas system are believed to have evolved from two different ancestral modules.

CRISPR/Cas can immunize bacteria against certain phages and thus halt transmission. For this reason, [[Eugene Koonin|Koonin]] described CRISPR/Cas as a [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] inheritance mechanism.&lt;ref name="pmid19906303"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Wolf YI | title = Is evolution Darwinian or/and Lamarckian? | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 4 | pages = 42 | date = November 2009 | pmid = 19906303 | pmc = 2781790 | doi = 10.1186/1745-6150-4-42 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was disputed by a critic who noted, "We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially. Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Weiss A | title = Lamarckian Illusions | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 30 | issue = 10 | pages = 566–568 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26411613 | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2015.08.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As more recent studies have been conducted, it has become apparent that the acquired spacer regions of CRISPR-Cas systems are a from of Lamarckian evolution because they are genetic mutations that are acquired and then passed on.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koonin EV, Wolf YI | title = Just how Lamarckian is CRISPR-Cas immunity: the continuum of evolvability mechanisms | journal = Biology Direct | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 9 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26912144 | pmc = 4765028 | doi = 10.1186/s13062-016-0111-z }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the evolution of the car gene machinery that facilitates the system evolves through classic Darwinian evolution.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Coevolution ===
Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed [[coevolution]] of host and viral genomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Heidelberg JF, Nelson WC, Schoenfeld T, Bhaya D | title = Germ warfare in a microbial mat community: CRISPRs provide insights into the co-evolution of host and viral genomes | journal = PLOS One | volume = 4 | issue = 1 | pages = e4169 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19132092 | pmc = 2612747 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0004169 | bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.4169H | editor1-last = Ahmed | editor1-first = Niyaz }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 proteins are highly enriched in [[pathogen]]ic and [[commensal]] bacteria. CRISPR/Cas-mediated gene regulation may contribute to the regulation of endogenous bacterial genes, particularly during interaction with eukaryotic hosts. For example, ''[[Francisella novicida]]'' uses a unique, small, CRISPR/Cas-associated RNA (scaRNA) to repress an endogenous transcript encoding a bacterial [[lipoprotein]] that is critical for ''F. novicida'' to dampen host response and promote virulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sampson TR, Saroj SD, Llewellyn AC, Tzeng YL, Weiss DS | title = A CRISPR/Cas system mediates bacterial innate immune evasion and virulence | journal = Nature | volume = 497 | issue = 7448 | pages = 254–7 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23584588 | pmc = 3651764 | doi = 10.1038/nature12048 | bibcode = 2013Natur.497..254S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic model of CRISPR evolution is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations. To fight off a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene. Phages can continue to infect their hosts given point mutations in the spacer.&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt; Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.&lt;ref name="pmid18065545" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20072129" /&gt;

=== Rates ===
A study of 124 ''S. thermophilus'' strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of spacer acquisition.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt; Some CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined. A [[Comparative genomics|comparative genomic]] analysis showed that ''E. coli'' and ''S. enterica'' evolve much more slowly than ''S. thermophilus''. The latter's strains that diverged 250 thousand years ago still contained the same spacer complement.&lt;ref name="pmid20559554"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Touchon M, Rocha EP | title = The small, slow and specialized CRISPR and anti-CRISPR of Escherichia and Salmonella | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = e11126 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20559554 | pmc = 2886076 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0011126 | editor1-last = Randau | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...511126T | editor1-first = Lennart }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[metagenomics|Metagenomic]] analysis of two acid mine drainage [[biofilm]]s showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions versus the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community than the other.&lt;ref name="pmid17894817" /&gt; In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7-22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% were shared across individuals.&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;

From the same environment a single strain was tracked using [[PCR]] primers specific to its CRISPR system. Broad-level results of spacer presence/absence showed significant diversity. However, this CRISPR added 3 spacers over 17 months,&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt; suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly.

CRISPRs were analysed from the metagenomes produced for the [[human microbiome project]].&lt;ref name="pmid22719260"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rho M, Wu YW, Tang H, Doak TG, Ye Y | title = Diverse CRISPRs evolving in human microbiomes | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1002441 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22719260 | pmc = 3374615 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.1002441 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although most were body-site specific, some within a body site are widely shared among individuals. One of these loci originated from [[streptococcal]] species and contained ~15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique. Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some showed little evolution over time.&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt;

CRISPR evolution was studied in [[chemostat]]s using ''S. thermophilus'' to directly examine spacer acquisition rates. In one week, ''S. thermophilus'' strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun CL, Barrangou R, Thomas BC, Horvath P, Fremaux C, Banfield JF | title = Phage mutations in response to CRISPR diversification in a bacterial population | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 463–70 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23057534 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02879.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same interval the phage developed [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s that became fixed in the population, suggesting that targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid23057534" /&gt;

Another ''S. thermophilus'' experiment showed that phages can infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer. Yet another showed that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high phage titres.&lt;ref name="pmid24586036"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kuno S, Sako Y, Yoshida T | title = Diversification of CRISPR within coexisting genotypes in a natural population of the bloom-forming cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa | journal = Microbiology | volume = 160 | issue = Pt 5 | pages = 903–16 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24586036 | doi = 10.1099/mic.0.073494-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.

== Identification ==

CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea&lt;ref name="pmid24728998" /&gt; and show some sequence similarities.&lt;ref name="pmid17442114" /&gt; Their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats. This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeats decreases the likelihood of a false positive match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sorek R, Kunin V, Hugenholtz P | title = CRISPR--a widespread system that provides acquired resistance against phages in bacteria and archaea | journal = Nature Reviews.

Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble, due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms. Where many reference genomes are available, [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content.&lt;ref name="pmid18065539" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21149389" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22583485"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pride DT, Salzman J, Relman DA | title = Comparisons of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and viromes in human saliva reveal bacterial adaptations to salivary viruses | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 14 | issue = 9 | pages = 2564–76 | date = September 2012 | pmid = 22583485 | pmc = 3424356 | doi = 10.1111/j.1462-2920.2012.02775.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid23701169"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Whitaker RJ | title = Reassortment of CRISPR repeat-spacer loci in Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = Environmental Microbiology | volume = 15 | issue = 11 | pages = 3065–76 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 23701169 | doi = 10.1111/1462-2920.12146 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid20927396"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Held NL, Herrera A, Cadillo-Quiroz H, Whitaker RJ | title = CRISPR associated diversity within a population of Sulfolobus islandicus | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = e12988 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20927396 | pmc = 2946923 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0012988 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...512988H }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) primers.

The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data. This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g. 454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read. CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely ''de novo'' identification&lt;ref name="pmid23511966"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Skennerton CT, Imelfort M, Tyson GW | title = Crass: identification and reconstruction of CRISPR from unassembled metagenomic data | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | pages = e105 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23511966 | pmc = 3664793 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkt183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from [[contig]]s (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA)&lt;ref name="pmid22719260" /&gt; and direct repeat sequences from published genomes&lt;ref name="pmid22732228"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stern A, Mick E, Tirosh I, Sagy O, Sorek R | title = CRISPR targeting reveals a reservoir of common phages associated with the human gut microbiome | journal = Genome Research | volume = 22 | issue = 10 | pages = 1985–94 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 22732228 | pmc = 3460193 | doi = 10.1101/gr.138297.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.

== Use by phages ==

Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having [[genomic island|chromosomal islands]]. A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication.&lt;ref name="pmid20634809"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Novick RP, Christie GE, Penadés JR | title = The phage-related chromosomal islands of Gram-positive bacteria | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 8 | issue = 8 | pages = 541–51 | date = August 2010 | pmid = 20634809 | pmc = 3522866 | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2393 }}&lt;/ref&gt; PICIs are induced, excised, replicated and finally packaged into small capsids by certain staphylococcal temperate phages. PICIs use several mechanisms to block phage reproduction. In first mechanism PICI-encoded Ppi differentially blocks phage maturation by binding or interacting specifically with phage TerS, hence blocks phage TerS/TerL complex  formation responsible for phage DNA packaging. In second mechanism PICI CpmAB redirect the phage capsid morphogenetic protein to make 95% of SaPI-sized capsid and pahage DNA can package only 1/3rd of their genome in these small capsid and hence become nonviable phage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|vauthors=Ram G, Chen J, Kumar K, Ross HF, Ubeda C, Damle PK, Lane KD, Penadés JR, Christie GE, Novick RP|date=October 2012|title=Staphylococcal pathogenicity island interference with helper phage reproduction is a paradigm of molecular parasitism|url=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=109|issue=40|pages=16300–5|doi=10.1073/pnas.1204615109|pmc=3479557|pmid=22991467|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third mechanism involves two proteins, PtiA and PtiB, that target the LtrC, which is responsible for the production of virion and lysis proteins.

One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets ''[[Vibrio cholerae]]'' [[serogroup]] O1, has acquired a CRISPR/Cas system that targets a ''V. cholera'' PICI-like element. The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes. It seems to be [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] to the I-F system found in ''[[Yersinia pestis]]''. Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR/Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR/Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.&lt;ref name="pmid23446421"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seed KD, Lazinski DW, Calderwood SB, Camilli A | title = A bacteriophage encodes its own CRISPR/Cas adaptive response to evade host innate immunity | journal = Nature | volume = 494 | issue = 7438 | pages = 489–91 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23446421 | pmc = 3587790 | doi = 10.1038/nature11927 | bibcode = 2013Natur.494..489S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predecessors ===

In the early 2000s, researchers developed [[zinc finger nuclease]]s (ZFNs), synthetic proteins whose [[DNA-binding domains]] enable them to create double-stranded breaks in DNA at specific points. In 2010, synthetic nucleases called [[transcription activator-like effector nuclease]]s (TALENs) provided an easier way to target a double-stranded break to a specific location on the DNA strand. Both zinc finger nucleases and TALENs require the creation of a custom protein for each targeted DNA sequence, which is a more difficult and time-consuming process than that for guide RNAs. CRISPRs are much easier to design because the process requires making only a short RNA sequence.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=Susan|date=11 February 2014|title=CRISPR and Other Genome Editing Tools Boost Medical Research and Gene Therapy's Reach|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/review/524451/genome-surgery|accessdate=2014-04-13|name-list-format=vanc|journal=[[MIT Technology Review]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genome engineering ===
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing is carried out with a [[CRISPR#Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes|Type II]] CRISPR system. When utilized for genome editing, this system includes [[Cas9]], crRNA, tracrRNA along with an optional section of DNA repair template that is utilized in either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology directed repair (HDR).

CRISPR/Cas9 often employs a [[plasmid]] to [[Transfection|transfect]] the target cells.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The main components of this plasmid are displayed in the image and listed in the table. The crRNA needs to be designed for each application as this is the sequence that Cas9 uses to identify and directly bind to the cell's DNA. The crRNA must bind only where editing is desired. The repair template is designed for each application, as it must overlap with the sequences on either side of the cut and code for the insertion sequence.

Multiple crRNAs and the tracrRNA can be packaged together to form a single-guide RNA (sgRNA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |url=https://archive.org/details/LyJosephP201311PhDThesis |title=Discovering Genes Responsible for Kidney Diseases |last=Ly |first=Joseph |year=2013 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=University of Toronto |accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This sgRNA can be joined together with the Cas9 gene and made into a plasmid in order to be transfected into cells.

==== Structure ====
CRISPR/Cas9 offers a high degree of fidelity and relatively simple construction. It depends on two factors for its specificity: the target sequence and the PAM. The target sequence is 20 bases long as part of each CRISPR locus in the crRNA array.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ran FA, Hsu PD, Wright J, Agarwala V, Scott DA, Zhang F | title = Genome engineering using the CRISPR-Cas9 system | journal = Nature Protocols | volume = 8 | issue = 11 | pages = 2281–308 | date = November 2013 | pmid = 24157548 | pmc = 3969860 | doi = 10.1038/nprot.2013.143 | hdl = 1721.1/102943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical crRNA array has multiple unique target sequences. Cas9 proteins select the correct location on the host's genome by utilizing the sequence to bond with base pairs on the host DNA. The sequence is not part of the Cas9 protein and as a result is customizable and can be independently [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthesized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Horvath P, Barrangou R | title = CRISPR/Cas, the immune system of bacteria and archaea | journal = Science | volume = 327 | issue = 5962 | pages = 167–70 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20056882 | doi = 10.1126/science.1179555 | bibcode = 2010Sci...327..167H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bialk P, Rivera-Torres N, Strouse B, Kmiec EB | title = Regulation of Gene Editing Activity Directed by Single-Stranded Oligonucleotides and CRISPR/Cas9 Systems | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = e0129308 | date = 2015-06-08 | pmid = 26053390 | pmc = 4459703 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0129308 | bibcode = 2015PLoSO..1029308B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The PAM sequence on the host genome is recognized by Cas9. Cas9 cannot be easily modified to recognize a different PAM sequence. However this is not too limiting as it is a short sequence and nonspecific (e.g. the SpCas9 PAM sequence is 5'-NGG-3' and in the human genome occurs roughly every 8 to 12 base pairs).&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt;

Once these have been assembled into a plasmid and transfected into cells the Cas9 protein with the help of the crRNA finds the correct sequence in the host cell's DNA and – depending on the Cas9 variant – creates a single or double strand break in the DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/11/12/crispr-cas9-gene-editing-check-three-times-cut-once/ |title=CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing: check three times, cut once | first = Robert | last = Sanders | name-list-format = vanc |date=12 November 2015 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |accessdate=26 December 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226231842/http://news.berkeley.edu/2015/11/12/crispr-cas9-gene-editing-check-three-times-cut-once/ |archivedate=26 December 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Properly spaced single strand breaks in the host DNA can trigger [[homology directed repair]], which is less error prone than the non-homologous end joining that typically follows a double strand break. Providing a DNA repair template allows for the insertion of a specific DNA sequence at an exact location within the genome. The repair template should extend 40 to 90 base pairs beyond the Cas9 induced DNA break.&lt;ref name="Ran_2013" /&gt; The goal is for the cell's HDR process to utilize the provided repair template and thereby incorporate the new sequence into the genome. Once incorporated, this new sequence is now part of the cell's genetic material and passes into its daughter cells.

Many online tools are available to aid in designing effective sgRNA sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Optimized CRISPR Design|url = http://crispr.mit.edu/|website = crispr.mit.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Delivery ====
{{See also|Transfection}}

Delivery of Cas9, sgRNA, and associated complexes into cells can occur via viral and non-viral systems. [[Electroporation]] of DNA, RNA, or ribonucleocomplexes is a common technique, though it can result in harmful effects on the target cells.&lt;ref name="Lino_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lino CA, Harper JC, Carney JP, Timlin JA | title = Delivering CRISPR: a review of the challenges and approaches | journal = Drug Delivery | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 1234–1257 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 29801422 | pmc = 6058482 | doi = 10.1080/10717544.2018.1474964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical transfection techniques utilizing [[lipid]]s have also been used to introduce sgRNA in complex with Cas9 into cells.&lt;ref name="Li_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Li L, Hu S, Chen X | title = Non-viral delivery systems for CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing: Challenges and opportunities | journal = Biomaterials | volume = 171 | issue = | pages = 207–218 | date = July 2018 | pmid = 29704747 | pmc = 5944364 | doi = 10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.04.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hard-to-transfect cells (e.g. stem cells, neurons, and hematopoietic cells) require more efficient delivery systems such as those based on [[lentivirus]] (LVs), [[Adenoviridae|adenovirus]] (AdV) and [[adeno-associated virus]] (AAV).&lt;ref name="Schmidt_2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Schmidt F, Grimm D | title = CRISPR genome engineering and viral gene delivery: a case of mutual attraction | journal = Biotechnology Journal | volume = 10 | issue = 2 | pages = 258–72 | date = February 2015 | pmid = 25663455 | doi = 10.1002/biot.201400529 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = CRISPR 101: Mammalian Expression Systems and Delivery Methods | first1 = Nicole | last1 = Waxmonsky | name-list-format = vanc | url = https://blog.addgene.org/crispr-101-mammalian-expression-systems-and-delivery-methods | date = 24 September 2015 | access-date = 11 June 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the past few years, epigenetic marks in different human cells have been closely researched and certain patterns within the marks have been found to correlate with everything ranging from tumor growth to brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = CRISPR: gene editing is just the beginning | journal = Nature | volume = 531 | issue = 7593 | pages = 156–9 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26961639 | doi = 10.1038/531156a | url = https://www.nature.com/news/crispr-gene-editing-is-just-the-beginning-1.19510 | bibcode = 2016Natur.531..156L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, CRISPR-mediated activation (CRISPRa) promotes gene transcription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dominguez AA, Lim WA, Qi LS | title = Beyond editing: repurposing CRISPR-Cas9 for precision genome regulation and interrogation | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 5–15 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26670017 | pmc = 4922510 | doi = 10.1038/nrm.2015.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cas9 is an effective way of targeting and silencing specific genes at the DNA level.&lt;ref name="pmid24336571"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalem O, Sanjana NE, Hartenian E, Shi X, Scott DA, Mikkelsen TS, Heckl D, Ebert BL, Root DE, Doench JG, Zhang F | title = Genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening in human cells | journal = Science | volume = 343 | issue = 6166 | pages = 84–7 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24336571 | pmc = 4089965 | doi = 10.1126/science.1247005 | bibcode = 2014Sci...343...84S }}&lt;/ref&gt; In bacteria, the presence of Cas9 alone is enough to block transcription. For mammalian applications, a section of protein is added. Its guide RNA targets regulatory DNA sequences called [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] that immediately precede the target gene.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

Cas9 was used to carry synthetic [[transcription factor]]s that activated specific human genes. The technique achieved a strong effect by targeting multiple CRISPR constructs to slightly different locations on the gene's promoter.&lt;ref name=craze/&gt;

=== RNA editing ===
In 2016, researchers demonstrated that CRISPR from an ordinary mouth bacterium could be used to edit [[RNA]]. The researchers searched databases containing hundreds of millions of genetic sequences for those that resembled Crispr genes. They considered the [[fusobacteria]] ''Leptotrichia shahii''. It had a group of genes that resembled CRISPR genes, but with important differences. When the researchers equipped other bacteria with these genes, which they called C2c2, they found that the organisms gained a novel defense.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/science/rna-c2c2-gene-editing-dna-crispr.html | title = Scientists Find Form of Crispr Gene Editing With New Capabilities|last=Zimmer|first=Carl | name-list-format = vanc | date=2016-06-03|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many viruses encode their genetic information in RNA rather than DNA that they repurpose to make new viruses. [[HIV]] and [[poliovirus]] are such viruses. Bacteria with C2c2 make molecules that can dismember RNA, destroying the virus. Tailoring these genes opened any RNA molecule to editing.&lt;ref name="Zimmer_2016" /&gt;

CRISPR-Cas systems can also be employed for editing of [[MicroRNA|micro-RNA]] and [[Long non-coding RNA|long-noncoding RNA]] genes in plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Basak J, Nithin C | title = Targeting Non-Coding RNAs in Plants with the CRISPR-Cas Technology is a Challenge yet Worth Accepting | journal = Frontiers in Plant Science | volume = 6 | pages = 1001 | date = 2015 | pmid = 26635829 | pmc = 4652605 | doi = 10.3389/fpls.2015.01001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease models ===

CRISPR simplifies creation of [[Genetically modified organism#Mammals|animals for research]] that mimic disease or show what happens when a gene is [[Gene knockdown|knocked down]] or mutated. CRISPR may be used at the [[germline]] level to create animals where the gene is changed everywhere, or it may be targeted at non-germline cells.&lt;ref name="pmid25914022"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Erp PB, Bloomer G, Wilkinson R, Wiedenheft B | title = The history and market impact of CRISPR RNA-guided nucleases | journal = Current Opinion in Virology | volume = 12 | issue =  | pages = 85–90 | date = June 2015 | pmid = 25914022 | doi = 10.1016/j.coviro.2015.03.011 | pmc = 4470805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25819765"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Maggio I, Gonçalves MA | title = Genome editing at the crossroads of delivery, specificity, and fidelity | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 33 | issue = 5 | pages = 280–91 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25819765 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2015.02.011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid25868999"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rath D, Amlinger L, Rath A, Lundgren M | title = The CRISPR-Cas immune system: biology, mechanisms and applications | journal = Biochimie | volume = 117 | issue =  | pages = 119–28 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 25868999 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2015.03.025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR can be utilized to create human cellular models of disease. For instance, applied to human [[Cell potency|pluripotent stem cells]] CRISPR introduced targeted mutations in genes relevant to [[polycystic kidney disease]] (PKD) and [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] (FSGS).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Freedman BS, Brooks CR, Lam AQ, Fu H, Morizane R, Agrawal V, Saad AF, Li MK, Hughes MR, Werff RV, Peters DT, Lu J, Baccei A, Siedlecki AM, Valerius MT, Musunuru K, McNagny KM, Steinman TI, Zhou J, Lerou PH, Bonventre JV | display-authors = 6 | title = Modelling kidney disease with CRISPR-mutant kidney organoids derived from human pluripotent epiblast spheroids | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | pages = 8715 | date = October 2015 | pmid = 26493500 | pmc = 4620584 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms9715 | bibcode = 2015NatCo...6E8715F }}&lt;/ref&gt; These CRISPR-modified pluripotent stem cells were subsequently grown into human kidney [[organoid]]s that exhibited disease-specific phenotypes.

A similar approach was taken to model long QT syndrome in [[Cardiac muscle cell|cardiomyocytes]] derived from pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bellin M, Casini S, Davis RP, D'Aniello C, Haas J, Ward-van Oostwaard D, Tertoolen LG, Jung CB, Elliott DA, Welling A, Laugwitz KL, Moretti A, Mummery CL | title = Isogenic human pluripotent stem cell pairs reveal the role of a KCNH2 mutation in long-QT syndrome | journal = The EMBO Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 24 | pages = 3161–75 | date = December 2013 | pmid = 24213244 | pmc = 3981141 | doi = 10.1038/emboj.2013.240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These CRISPR-generated cellular models, with isogenic controls, provide a new way to study human disease and test drugs.

=== Gene drive ===
{{Main|Gene drive}}
Gene drives may provide a powerful tool to restore balance of ecosystems by eliminating invasive species. Concerns regarding efficacy, unintended consequences in the target species as well as non-target species have been raised particularly in the potential for accidental release from laboratories into the wild.

CRISPR/Cas-based "RNA-guided nucleases" can be used to target [[virulence factors]], genes encoding [[antibiotic resistance]] and other medically relevant sequences of interest.

Research suggests that CRISPR is an effective way to limit replication of multiple [[herpesviruses]]. It was able to eradicate viral DNA in the case of [[Epstein-Barr virus]] (EBV). Anti-herpesvirus CRISPRs have promising applications such as removing cancer-causing EBV from tumor cells, helping rid donated organs for [[immunocompromised]] patients of viral invaders, or preventing [[Herpes labialis|cold sore]] outbreaks and recurrent eye infections by blocking [[HSV-1]] reactivation. {{as of|2016|August}}, these were awaiting testing.&lt;ref name="pmid27362483"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Diemen FR, Kruse EM, Hooykaas MJ, Bruggeling CE, Schürch AC, van Ham PM, Imhof SM, Nijhuis M, Wiertz EJ, Lebbink RJ | title = CRISPR/Cas9-Mediated Genome Editing of Herpesviruses Limits Productive and Latent Infections | journal = PLoS Pathogens | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = e1005701 | year = 2016 | pmid = 27362483 | pmc = 4928872 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1005701 | laysummary = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQaWh8VLkiU | laysource = PLOS Media YouTube Channel }}&lt;/ref&gt; CRISPR is being applied to develop tissue-based treatments for cancer and other diseases.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid27595406"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liu Y, Zhan Y, Chen Z, He A, Li J, Wu H, Liu L, Zhuang C, Lin J, Guo X, Zhang Q, Huang W, Cai Z | display-authors = 6 | title = Directing cellular information flow via CRISPR signal conductors | journal = Nature Methods | volume =  13| issue =  11| date = September 2016 | pmid = 27595406 | doi = 10.1038/nmeth.3994 | pages=938–944}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRISPR may revive the concept of [[Xenotransplantation|transplanting]] animal organs into people. [[Retroviruses]] present in animal genomes could harm transplant recipients. In 2015, a team eliminated 62 copies of a retrovirus's DNA from the pig genome in a kidney epithelial cell.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough"/&gt; Researchers recently demonstrated the ability to birth live pig specimens after removing these retroviruses from their genome using CRISPR for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608579/crispr-opens-up-new-possibilities-for-transplants-using-pig-organs/|title=Using CRISPR on pigs could make their organs safer for human transplant|last=Mullin|first=Emily | name-list-format = vanc |work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2017-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== CRISPR in cancer ====
{{as of|2016}} CRISPR had been studied in animal models and cancer cell lines, to learn if it can be used to repair or thwart mutated genes that cause [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan FA, Pandupuspitasari NS, Chun-Jie H, Ao Z, Jamal M, Zohaib A, Khan FA, Hakim MR, ShuJun Z | title = CRISPR/Cas9 therapeutics: a cure for cancer and other genetic diseases | journal = Oncotarget | volume = 7 | issue = 32 | pages = 52541–52552 | date = August 2016 | pmid = 27250031 | pmc = 5239572 | doi = 10.18632/oncotarget.9646 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first clinical trial involving CRISPR started in 2016. It involved removing immune cells from people with lung cancer, using CRISPR to edit out the gene expressed PD-1, then administrating the altered cells back to the same person. 20 other trials were under way or nearly ready, mostly in China, {{as of|2017|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Michael | last = Le Page | name-list-format = vanc | title=Boom in human gene editing as 20 CRISPR trials gear up|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133095-boom-in-human-gene-editing-as-20-crispr-trials-gear-up/|work=New Scientist|date=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the [[Food and Drug Administration|United States Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved a clinical trial in which CRISPR would be used to alter T cells extracted from people with different kinds of cancer and then administer those engineered T cells back to the same people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20137 |title=First CRISPR clinical trial gets green light from US panel |journal=Nature |year=2016 |last1=Reardon |first1=Sara | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gene function ===
In 2015, multiple studies attempted to systematically disable each individual human gene, in an attempt to identify which genes were essential to human biology. Between 1,600 and 1,800 genes passed this test—of the 20,000 or so known human genes. Such genes are more strongly activated, and unlikely to carry disabling mutations. They are more likely to have indispensable counterparts in other species. They build proteins that unite to form larger collaborative complexes. The studies also cataloged the essential genes in four cancer-cell lines and identified genes that are expendable in healthy cells, but crucial in specific tumor types and drugs that could target these rogue genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Revolutionary Gene-Editing Technique That Reveals Cancer's Weaknesses|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2015/11/a-revolutionary-gene-editing-technique-reveals-cancers-weaknesses/417495/|website = The Atlantic|access-date = 2016-02-21 | first = Ed | last = Yong | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2015-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specific functions of some 18 percent of the essential genes are unidentified. In one 2015 targeting experiment, disabling individual genes in groups of cells attempted to identify those involved in resistance to a [[melanoma]] drug. Each such gene manipulation is itself a separate "drug", potentially opening the entire genome to CRISPR-based regulation.&lt;ref name="Science_Breakthrough" /&gt;

=== ''In vitro'' genetic depletion ===
Unenriched sequencing libraries often have abundant undesired sequences. Cas9 can specifically deplete the undesired sequences with double strand breakage with up to 99% efficiency and without significant [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] as seen with [[restriction enzyme]]s. Treatment with Cas9 can deplete abundant rRNA while increasing pathogen sensitivity in RNA-seq libraries.&lt;ref name="pmid26944702"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gu W, Crawford ED, O'Donovan BD, Wilson MR, Chow ED, Retallack H, DeRisi JL | title = Depletion of Abundant Sequences by Hybridization (DASH): using Cas9 to remove unwanted high-abundance species in sequencing libraries and molecular counting applications | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 41 | date = March 2016 | pmid = 26944702 | pmc = 4778327 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-016-0904-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''In vivo'' applications ===
CRISPR/Cas-9 can be used to edit the DNA of organisms ''in vivo'' and entire chromosomes can be eliminated from an organism at any point in its development. Chromosomes that have been deleted ''in vivo'' are the Y chromosomes and X chromosomes of adult lab mice and human chromosomes 14 and 21, in embryonic stem cell lines and [[aneuploid]] mice respectively. This method might be useful for treating genetic aneuploid diseases such as [[Down Syndrome]] and [[intersex]] disorders.&lt;ref name="pmid29178945"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zuo E, Huo X, Yao X, Hu X, Sun Y, Yin J, He B, Wang X, Shi L, Ping J, Wei Y, Ying W, Wei W, Liu W, Tang C, Li Y, Hu J, Yang H | display-authors = 6 | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted chromosome elimination | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 1 | pages = 224 | year = 2017 | pmid = 29178945 | pmc = 5701507 | doi = 10.1186/s13059-017-1354-4 | lay-summary = https://www.genomeweb.com/gene-silencinggene-editing/crispr-used-eliminate-targeted-chromosomes-new-study | lay-source= Genome Web }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised that [[Off-target genome editing|off-target effects]] (editing of genes besides the ones intended) may obscure the results of a CRISRP gene editing experiment (the observed phenotypic change may not be due to modifying the target gene, but some other gene).  Modifications to CRISRP have been made to minimize the possibility of off-target effects.  In addition, orthogonal CRISPR experiments are recommended to confirm the results of a gene editing experiment.&lt;ref name="Kadam_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kadam US, Shelake RM, Chavhan RL, Suprasanna P | title = Concerns regarding 'off-target' activity of genome editing endonucleases | journal = Plant Physiology and Biochemistry | volume = 131 | issue = | pages = 22–30 | date = October 2018 | pmid = 29653762 | doi = 10.1016/j.plaphy.2018.03.027 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kimberland_2018"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kimberland ML, Hou W, Alfonso-Pecchio A, Wilson S, Rao Y, Zhang S, Lu Q | title = Strategies for controlling CRISPR/Cas9 off-target effects and biological variations in mammalian genome editing experiments | journal = Journal of Biotechnology | volume = 284 | issue = | pages = 91–101 | date = August 2018 | pmid = 30142414 | doi = 10.1016/j.jbiotec.2018.08.007 | department = review }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patents and commercialization ==

{{as of|2014|December}}, [[patent rights]] to CRISPR were contested. Several companies formed to develop related drugs and research tools.&lt;ref name="TR"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/532796/who-owns-the-biggest-biotech-discovery-of-the-century/ | title = Who Owns the Biggest Biotech Discovery of the Century?

As of November 2018, All the CRISPR patent holders and institutes associated with them have set up companies to commercialize the patents by sub-licensing them for therapeutic, agriculture and many other application areas to biotech firms, pharmaceuticals, agri-businesses etc. Caribou Biosciences, ERS Genomics, Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, and CRISPR Therapeutics are the spin offs associated with CRISPR landscape. Not many large scale commercial assignees have actively participated in the early phases of the CRISPR–Cas patent landscape. The only large establishments making it to the top ten are Dow AgroSciences and DuPont Nutrition Science (now merged as DowDuPont), together holding 20 inventions in CRISPR-Cas9 applications in agriculture and animal biotechnology&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.prweb.com/releases/2018/11/prweb15924785.htm|title=CRISPR Cas9 Genome Editing Market Worth $5.3 Billion by 2025|work=PRWeb|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Society and culture ==

=== Human germline modification ===

As of March 2015, multiple groups had announced ongoing research to learn how they one day might apply CRISPR to human embryos, including labs in the US, China, and the UK, as well as US biotechnology company [[OvaScience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Antonio | last = Regalado | name-list-format = vanc | journal = MIT Technology Review | date = March 5, 2015 | url = http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/535661/engineering-the-perfect-baby/ | title = Engineering the Perfect Baby }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Scientists, including a CRISPR co-discoverer, urged a worldwide moratorium on applying CRISPR to the human germline, especially for clinical use.

In April 2015, Chinese scientists reported results of an attempt to alter the [[DNA]] of non-viable [[human embryos]] using CRISPR to correct a [[mutation]] that causes [[beta thalassemia]], a lethal heritable disorder.&lt;ref name="LiangXu2015"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Liang P, Xu Y, Zhang X, Ding C, Huang R, Zhang Z, Lv J, Xie X, Chen Y, Li Y, Sun Y, Bai Y, Songyang Z, Ma W, Zhou C, Huang J | title = CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing in human tripronuclear zygotes | journal = Protein &amp; Cell | volume = 6 | issue = 5 | pages = 363–72 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25894090 | pmc = 4417674 | doi = 10.1007/s13238-015-0153-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20150423"&gt;{{cite news | last = Kolata | first = Gina  | name-list-format = vanc | title=Chinese Scientists Edit Genes of Human Embryos, Raising Concerns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/health/chinese-scientists-edit-genes-of-human-embryos-raising-concerns.html |date=23 April 2015 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=24 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study had previously been rejected by both ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in part because of ethical concerns.&lt;ref name=NatureNews&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature.2015.17378 |title=Chinese scientists genetically modify human embryos |journal=Nature |year=2015 |last1=Cyranoski |first1=David |last2=Reardon |first2=Sara | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments resulted in successfully changing only some of the intended genes, and had [[Off-target effects of genome editing|off-target effects]] on other genes. The researchers stated that CRISPR is not ready for clinical application in [[reproductive medicine]].&lt;ref name=NatureNews/&gt; In April 2016, Chinese scientists were reported to have made a second unsuccessful attempt to alter the DNA of non-viable human embryos using CRISPR - this time to alter the [[CCR5]] gene to make the embryo HIV resistant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601235/chinese-researchers-experiment-with-making-hiv-proof-embryos/|title=Chinese Researchers Experiment with Making HIV-Proof Embryos|last=Regalado|first=Antonio|name-list-format = vanc |date=2016-05-08|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, an International Summit on Human Gene Editing took place in Washington under the guidance of [[David Baltimore]]. Members of national scientific academies of America, Britain and China discussed the ethics of germline modification. They agreed to support basic and clinical research under certain legal and ethical guidelines. A specific distinction was made between [[somatic cells]], where the effects of edits are limited to a single individual, versus germline cells, where genome changes could be inherited by descendants. Heritable modifications could have unintended and far-reaching consequences for human evolution, genetically (e.g. gene/environment interactions) and culturally (e.g. [[Social Darwinism]]). Altering of [[gametocytes]] and embryos to generate inheritable changes in humans was defined to be irresponsible. The group agreed to initiate an international forum to address such concerns and harmonize regulations across countries.&lt;ref name="National Academy of Science"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=12032015a | date =3 December 2015 | title = International Summit on Gene Editing | publisher =[[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine]] | accessdate = 3 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, [[He Jiankui]] announced that he had edited two human embryos, to attempt to disable the gene for [[CCR5]], which codes for a receptor that [[HIV]] uses to enter cells. He said that twin girls, Lulu and Nana, had been born a few weeks earlier.  He said that the girls still carried functional copies of CCR5 along with disabled CCR5 ([[mosaicism]]) and were still vulnerable to HIV.  The work was widely condemned as unethical, dangerous, and premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Begley |first1=Sharon |title=Amid uproar, Chinese scientist defends creating gene-edited babies - STAT |url=https://www.statnews.com/2018/11/28/chinese-scientist-defends-creating-gene-edited-babies/ |work=STAT |date=28 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policy barriers to genetic engineering ===

Policy regulations for the CRISPR/cas9 system vary around the globe. In February 2016, British scientists were given permission by regulators to genetically modify [[human embryos]] by using CRISPR-Cas9 and related techniques. However, researchers were forbidden from implanting the embryos and the embryos were to be destroyed after seven days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Callaway E | title = UK scientists gain licence to edit genes in human embryos | journal = Nature | volume = 530 | issue = 7588 | pages = 18 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26842037 | doi = 10.1038/nature.2016.19270 | bibcode = 2016Natur.530...18C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US has an elaborate, interdepartmental regulatory system to evaluate new genetically modified foods and crops. For example, the [[Agriculture Risk Protection Act of 2000]] gives the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] the authority to oversee the detection, control, eradication, suppression, prevention, or retardation of the spread of plant pests or noxious weeds to protect the agriculture, environment and economy of the US. The act regulates any [[genetically modified organism]] that utilizes the genome of a predefined 'plant pest' or any plant not previously categorized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McHughen A, Smyth S | title = US regulatory system for genetically modified [genetically modified organism (GMO), rDNA or transgenic] crop cultivars | journal = Plant Biotechnology Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–12 | date = January 2008 | pmid = 17956539 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-7652.2007.00300.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Yinong Yang successfully deactivated 16 specific genes in the white button mushroom.

With the help of the US [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine]], special interests groups met on April 15 to contemplate the possible advancements in genetic engineering within the next 5 years and potential policy regulations that would need to come into play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ledford H | title = Gene-editing surges as US rethinks regulations | journal = Nature | volume = 532 | issue = 7598 | pages = 158–9 | date = April 2016 | pmid = 27075074 | doi = 10.1038/532158a | bibcode = 2016Natur.532..158L }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the emergence of rogue genetic engineers employing the technology, the [[FDA]] has begun issuing new regulations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2017/02/the-fda-is-cracking-down-on-rogue-genetic-engineers/ "The FDA Is Cracking Down On Rogue Genetic Engineers"], Kristen V.

'''Chelates ( che·late ) [kee-leyt] in [[animal feed]]''' are organic forms of essential trace minerals such as [[copper]], [[iron]], [[manganese]] and [[zinc]].

[[Animal]]s absorb, digest and use mineral chelates better than inorganic minerals. This means that lower concentrations can be used in animal feeds. In addition, animals fed chelated sources of essential trace minerals excrete lower amounts in their faeces, and so there is less environmental contamination. Mineral chelates also offers health and welfare benefits in [[animal nutrition]]

==Brief History of Chelates ==
{{see also|Minerals}} 
Since the 1950s, animal feeds have been supplemented with essential [[trace mineral]]s such as copper (Cu), iron (Fe), [[iodine]] (I), manganese (Mn), [[molybdenum]] (Mo), [[selenium]] (Se) and zinc (Zn). Initially, such supplementation was by means of inorganic salts of essential trace elements. From the 1960s onwards, genetic improvement of farm livestock resulted in increased nutritional requirements for these nutrients. [[Chelated minerals]] were developed in the 1980s and 1990s. Trace mineral chelates have proven to be better than inorganic minerals in meeting the nutritional needs of modern [[Livestock|farm animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;(McCartney, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role and source of minerals ==

The objective of supplementation with trace minerals is to avoid a variety of [[deficiency disease]]s. Trace minerals carry out key functions in relation to many [[Metabolism|metabolic processes]], most notably as [[catalyst]]s for [[enzyme]]s and [[hormone]]s, and are essential for optimum health, growth and productivity. For example, supplementary minerals help ensure good growth, bone development, [[feather]]ing in birds, [[hoof]], [[skin]] and [[hair]] quality in mammals, enzyme structure and functions, and appetite. Deficiency of trace minerals affect many metabolic processes and so may be manifested by different symptoms, such as poor growth and [[appetite]], reproductive failures, impaired [[immune response]]s, and general ill-thrift. From the 1950s to the 1990s most trace mineral supplementation of animal diets was in the form of inorganic minerals, and these largely eradicated associated deficiency diseases in farm animals.

The role in [[fertility]] and reproductive diseases of [[dairy cattle]] highlights that organic forms of Zn are retained better than inorganic sources and so may provide greater benefit in [[disease prevention]], notably [[mastitis]] and [[Lameness (equine)|lameness]]

===Sources of essential minerals===
In recent decades, global food animal production has intensified and genetic potential for growth and yields has improved. As a result, commercial tendencies have been to increase trace [[Mineral supplements|mineral supplementation]],in order to allow for the greater mineral requirements of superior stock reared under industrial conditions. Increasing the concentration of inorganic minerals in animal diets has led to several problems.

The use of high Cu in [[swine]] and [[poultry]] rations has caused accidental Cu poisoning in more sensitive animals, such as [[sheep]] grazing pastures fertilised with pig or poultry [[manure]]  SCAN (2003a) Opinion of the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition on the use of copper in feedingstuffs. Secondly, inorganic minerals may form insoluble complexes with other dietary agents resulting in low absorption. In addition, it is thought that the positive charge of many inorganic minerals reduces access to the [[enterocyte]]s due to repulsion by the negatively charged [[mucin]] layer and competition for binding sites.

Finally, the poor retention and high [[excretion]] rates of inorganic minerals led to environmental concerns during the 1980s and 1990s, especially in [[Europe]] .Opinion of the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition on the use of zinc in feedingstuffs]. The [[European Union]] is concerned about possible detrimental effects of excess supplementation with trace minerals on the environment or human and animal health, and so in 2003 legislated a reduction in permitted feed concentrations of several [[trace metal]]s (Co, Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn).&lt;ref&gt;Commission Regulation (EC) No 1334/2003 of 25 July 2003 amending the conditions for authorisation of a number of additives in feedingstuffs belonging to the group of trace elements. 26.7.2003 EN Official Journal of the E.U.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research in trace element [[nutrition]] has led to the development of more bioavailable organic minerals, including trace minerals derived from chelates. Chelates allow a lower supplementation rate of trace minerals with an equivalent or improved effect on animal health, growth and productivity . Some samples of natural minerals at the Wikimedia Commons:

==Particular types of Chelates ==

;They are in summary;
*[[Chelates]], are [[organic molecule]]s, normally consisting of 2 organic parts with an essential trace mineral occupying a central position and held in place by [[covalent bond]]ing.
*Proteinate, are a particular type of chelate, in which the mineral is chelated with short-chain [[peptide]]s and [[amino acid]]s derived from [[Hydrolyzed protein|hydrolysed soy proteins]] and contain roughly 10-20% of the trace mineral. {{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} In proteinates, minerals are bound to various amino acids with different levels of stability
*Amino-acid complex, such as glycinates or methionates, are other particular types of chelate, in which the mineral is chelated with an amino acid. Based on one single type of amino-acid, the product is pure (there is only one type of bond or chelation between minerals and the ligand) and it is therefore easier to work on stability and ensure a full chelation. Moreover, depending on the size of amino acid, it is also possible to increase the metal content

Some notice concluded that the utilisation of organic Cu from a copper chelate  or copper lysine were higher than that of inorganic Cu sulfate when fed to rats in the presence and absence of elemental Zn or Fe. The data suggest that, unlike inorganic Cu, organic Cu chelates exhibit absorption and excretion mechanisms that do not interfere with Fe. Copper chelate also achieved higher liver Zn, suggesting less interference at gut absorption sites in comparison with the other forms of Cu.&lt;ref&gt;quote by Du et al.,1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Z.

Trammell (1996) Utilization of copper in copper proteinate, copper lysine and cupric sulfate using the rat as an experimental model.Journal of animal science&lt;/ref&gt;

Effect of organic zinc sources on performance, zinc status and carcass, meat and claw quality in fattening bulls. Livestock Prod.&lt;ref&gt;Sci. 81:161-171.&lt;/ref&gt; compared a Zn chelate, a Zn [[polysaccharide]] complex and ZnO (inorganic [[zinc oxide]]) in bull [[beef cattle]], and concluded that the organic forms resulted in some improvement in hoof claw quality.

Compared the [[bioavailability]] of Cu and Zn chelates in sheep with the inorganic sulfate forms, at "low" and "high" supplementation rates. Copper and Zn chelates at the lower rates caused significantly greater increases in [[blood plasma]] concentrations than the corresponding treatments with Zn sulfate (p&lt;0.05) and Cu sulfate (p&lt;0.01).
In addition, Zinc chelate supplementation resulted in significantly greater hoof horn Zn content than did Zn sulfate (p&lt;0.05). At the "low" supplementation rate Zinc chelate achieved better hoof quality than Zn sulfate (p&lt;0.05). The data suggest that Cu and Zn chelates are more readily absorbed and more easily deposited in key tissues such as hooves, in comparison with inorganic Zn forms.&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Ryan, P. Kearns and T. Quinn (2002) Bioavailability of dietary copper and zinc in adult Texel sheep: A comparative study of the effects of sulfate and Bioplex supplementation. Irish Veterinary Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

In weaned piglets evaluated various supplementation rates of organic Zn in the form of a chelate or as a polysaccharide complex and compared these with ZnO, zinc oxide, at 2,000 ppm. Feeding lower concentrations of organic Zn greatly decreased the amount of Zn excreted in comparison with inorganic Zn, without loss of growth performance.&lt;ref&gt;M.S. Carlson, C.A. Boren, C.Wu, C.E. Huntington, D.W. Bollinger and T.L. Veum (2004) Evaluation of various inclusion rates of organic zinc either as polysaccharide or proteinate complex on the growth performance, plasma and excretion of nursery pigs. J. Anim. Science&lt;/ref&gt;

Studied a Copper chelate in weaned pigs in comparison with inorganic Cu and sulfate. Piglet performance was consistently better with organic Cu at 50 to 100 ppm, in comparison with inorganic Cu at 250 ppm. In addition, organic Cu increased Cu absorption and retention, and decreased Cu excretion 77% and 61% respectively, compared with 250 ppm inorganic Cu.&lt;ref&gt;T.L. Veum, M.S. Carlson, C.W.

Sci&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hořčík2.PNG|thumb|200px|Magnesium sample]]
The effects of an Mg chelate in broiler chickens in comparison with [[magnesium oxide]] and an unsupplemented control group. Diets for fattening [[chicken]] are not normally supplemented with Mg, but this study indicated positive effects on performance and meat quality. During the first 3 weeks of life, the Mg chelate improved feed efficiency significantly in comparison with both the inorganic MgO and the negative control group (p&lt;0.05). Thigh meat pH and oxidative deterioration during storage were also studied. The Mg chelate increased thigh meat pH in comparison with the negative control (p&lt;0.05). Mg supplementation significantly reduced chemical indicators ([[TBARS]]) of oxidative deterioration in [[liver]] and thigh [[muscle]] (p&lt;0.01), with Mg chelate significantly more efficient than MgO (p&lt;0.01). The data suggest that organic Mg in the form of a chelate is capable of reducing [[oxidation]], and so improve chicken meat quality.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Guo,Zhang,Yuan and W. Nie.et al.,2003,Effects of source and level of magnesium and Vitamin E on prevention of hepatic peroxidation and oxidative deterioration of broiler meat., Sci.Tech.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Zn chelate supplement was compared with Zn sulfate in broiler chickens.Weight gain and feed intake increased quadratically (p&lt;0.05) with increasing Zn concentrations from the chelate and linearly with Zn sulfate. The relative bioavailability of the Zn chelate was 183% and 157% of Zn sulfate for weight gain and [[tibia]] Zn, respectively. The authors concluded that the supplemental concentration of Zn required in corn-soy diets for broilers from 1–21 days of age would be 9.8&amp;nbsp;mg/kg diet as Zn chelate and 20.1&amp;nbsp;mg/kg diet as Zn sulfate,respectively.&lt;ref&gt;T. Ao, J.L. Pierce, R. Power, K.A. Dawson, A.J. Pescatore, A.H. Cantor and M.J. Ford (2006) Investigation of relative bioavailability value and requirement of organic zinc for chicks. J. Poultry. Sci&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of replacing inorganic minerals with organic minerals in broiler chickens. One group of chickens received inorganic sulfates of Cu (12 ppm), Fe (45 ppm), Mn (70 ppm) and Zn (37 ppm) and their performance was compared to a similar group supplemented with chelates of Cu (2.5 ppm), Fe, Mn, and Zn (all at 10 ppm). 
There were no differences in performance between the birds fed the high inorganic minerals and the birds fed the low organic chelates. Faecal concentrations of Cu, Fe, Mn and Zn were 55%, 73%, 46% and 63%, respectively, of control birds fed inorganic minerals.&lt;ref&gt;quote by Nollet et al.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A broiler study reported  also compared inorganic and organic mineral supplementation in broiler chickens. Control birds were fed Cu, Fe, Mn Se and Zn in inorganic forms (15 ppm Cu 15 from sulfate; 60 ppm Fe from sulfate etc.),and compared with three treatment groups supplemented with organic forms. Apart from improved feathering, most likely associated with the presence of organic Se, there were no significant performance differences between birds fed inorganic and organic minerals. The authors concluded that the use of organic trace minerals permits a reduction of at least 33% in supplement rates in comparison with inorganic minerals, without compromising performance.&lt;ref&gt;by Peric et al.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its establishment in May 2006, the Institute of Public &amp; Environmental Affairs (IPE), a registered non-profit organization based in [[Beijing]], China, has developed the China Pollution Map Database to  monitor corporate environmental performance, pinpoint geographical locations of [[pollution]] sources and to act as an informational platform on regional pollution status, such as water and air quality, and pollutant discharge rankings. This publicly available information resource brings together over 97,000 environmental supervision records from government departments, at all levels and regions, throughout mainland China. These records, dating back as far as 2004, allow for the expansion of environmental information disclosure, enabling communities to fully understand the hazards and risks in the surrounding environment, thus promoting widespread public participation in environmental governance. 

With the improvements made to the IPE website and thus ‘China Pollution Map Database,’ over the last two years the number of official government-sourced violation records, from all regions in China, added to the ‘China Pollution Map Database,’ has grown by over 40,000; each having its own particular circumstances and need for a prompt and effective resolution. 

This important publicly available resource allows stakeholders, at all levels, to be informed, providing opportunities for individual and community inclusion, as well as NGO and media engagement. The IPE hopes this societal supervision of corporate and regional environmental performance and the external pressure on government will promote greater efforts towards enforcement and compliance, and in turn will provide a safer, cleaner and healthier environment for all.

When developing and updating the ‘China Pollution Map Database,’ the IPE pays special attention to the annually published, government authored, ''List of Key State Monitored Enterprises''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipe.org.cn/Upload/file/Notices/Reports/Key-State-Monitored-Enterprises-2010.pdf ''List of Key State Monitored Enterprises''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120903001551/http://www.ipe.org.cn/Upload/file/Notices/Reports/Key-State-Monitored-Enterprises-2010.pdf |date=2012-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which according to set selection principles and methods, identifies those companies that occupy 65% of China’s industrial discharge volume, in traditionally heavy polluting industries. Through, often difficult, research and field visits, the IPE aims to continue the geographical positioning of the location of these companies.

In continuation of this program, the IPE intends to continue arduously collecting, organizing and disseminating this environmental data, and information on corporate violations from around China.

'''Cold and heat adaptations in humans''' are a part of the broad adaptability of ''[[Homo sapiens]]''. Adaptations in humans can be [[Physiological adaptations|physiological]], [[Genetics|genetic]], or [[Culture|cultural]], which allow people to live in a wide variety of [[climate]]s. There has been a great deal of research done on developmental adjustment, [[acclimatization]], and cultural practices, but less research on genetic adaptations to cold and heat temperatures.

The human body always works to remain in [[homeostasis]]. One form of homeostasis is [[thermoregulation]]. Body temperature varies in every individual, but the average internal temperature is 37.0&amp;nbsp;°C (98.6&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/767567894|title=Harrison's online|last=1949-|first=Longo, Dan L. (Dan Louis),|last2=1900-1978.|first2=Harrison, Tinsley Randolph,|publisher=McGraw-Hill|oclc=767567894}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stress from extreme external temperature can cause the human body to shut down. [[Hypothermia]] can set in when the core temperature drops to 35&amp;nbsp;°C (95&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Douglas J.A.|last2=Brugger|first2=Hermann|last3=Boyd|first3=Jeff|last4=Paal|first4=Peter|date=2012-11-15|title=Accidental Hypothermia|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMra1114208|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=367|issue=20|pages=1930–1938|doi=10.1056/NEJMra1114208|issn=0028-4793|pmid=23150960}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hyperthermia]] can set in when the core body temperature rises above 37.5-38.3&amp;nbsp;°C (99.5-100.9&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Axelrod|first=Yekaterina K.|last2=Diringer|first2=Michael N.|title=Temperature Management in Acute Neurologic Disorders|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0733861908000236|journal=Neurologic Clinics|volume=26|issue=2|pages=585–603|doi=10.1016/j.ncl.2008.02.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laupland|first=Kevin B.|title=Fever in the critically ill medical patient|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CCM.0b013e3181aa6117|journal=Critical Care Medicine|volume=37|issue=Supplement|pages=S273–S278|doi=10.1097/ccm.0b013e3181aa6117}}&lt;/ref&gt; These temperatures commonly result in mortality. Humans have adapted to living in these extreme climates primarily through culture and technology, such as the use of clothing and shelter.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daanen|first=Hein A. M.|last2=Lichtenbelt|first2=Wouter D.

== Origin of cold and heat adaptations ==
Modern humans emerged from Africa approximately 40,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Evidence suggests that modern culture may have originated then, too.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Richard G.|date=2000-01-01|title=Archeology and the evolution of human behavior|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(2000)9:13.0.CO;2-A/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=17–36|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(2000)9:13.0.CO;2-A|issn=1520-6505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern humans spread into Europe and outcompeted [[Neanderthal]]s, which suggests that early modern humans were adaptable enough to live in various climates. This is supported in the variability selection hypothesis proposed by Richard Potts, which says that human adaptability came from environmental change over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Potts|first=Richard|date=1998-01-01|title=Environmental hypotheses of hominin evolution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(1998)107:27+3.0.CO;2-X/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=107|issue=S27|pages=93–136|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1096-8644(1998)107:27+3.0.CO;2-X|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecogeographic rules ===
[[Bergmann's rule|Bergmann’s rule]] states that [[endotherm]]ic animal subspecies living in colder climates have larger bodies than that of the subspecies living in warmer climates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1953-08-01|title=The Application of Ecological Rules to the Racial Anthropology of the Aboriginal New World*|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020/abstract|journal=American Anthropologist|language=en|volume=55|issue=3|pages=311–327|doi=10.1525/aa.1953.55.3.02a00020|issn=1548-1433}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with larger bodies are better suited for colder climates because larger bodies produce more heat due to having more cells, and have a smaller surface area compared to smaller individuals, which reduces heat loss. A study by Frederick Foster and Mark Collard found that Bergmann’s rule can be applied to humans when the latitude and temperature between groups differ widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Foster|first=Frederick|last2=Collard|first2=Mark|date=2013-08-28|title=A Reassessment of Bergmann's Rule in Modern Humans|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0072269|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=8|pages=e72269|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0072269|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3756069|pmid=24015229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allen's rule|Allen’s rule]] is a biological rule that says the limbs of an endotherm is either shorter in cold climates or longer in hot climates. Limb length affects the body’s surface area, which helps with thermoregulation. Shorter limbs help to conserve heat, while longer limbs help to dissipate heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holliday|first=Trenton W.|last2=Hilton|first2=Charles E.|date=2010-06-01|title=Body proportions of circumpolar peoples as evidenced from skeletal data: Ipiutak and Tigara (Point Hope) versus Kodiak Island Inuit|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21226/abstract|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|language=en|volume=142|issue=2|pages=287–302|doi=10.1002/ajpa.21226|issn=1096-8644}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall T. Newman argues that this can be observed in [[Eskimo]], who have shorter limbs than other people and are laterally built.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Marshall T.|date=1961-06-01|title=Biological Adaptation of Man to His Environment: Heat, Cold, Altitude, and Nutrition|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb31093.x/abstract|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=91|issue=3|pages=617–633|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1961.tb31093.x|issn=1749-6632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological adaptations ==
{{main|Thermoregulation in humans}}
Ambient air temperature affects how much energy investment the human body must make. The temperature that requires the least amount of energy investment is 21&amp;nbsp;°C (69.8&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The body controls its temperature through the [[hypothalamus]]. [[Thermoreceptor]]s in the skin send signals to the hypothalamus, which indicate when [[vasodilation]] and [[vasoconstriction]] should occur.

=== Cold ===
The human body has two methods of [[thermogenesis]], which produces heat to raise the core body temperature. The first is [[shivering]], which occurs in an unclothed person when the ambient air temperature is under 25&amp;nbsp;°C (77&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/26763611|title=Human adaptation and accommodation|last=1939-|first=Frisancho, A. Roberto,|date=1993-01-01|publisher=University of Michigan Press|oclc=26763611}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is limited by the amount of [[glycogen]] available in the body.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The second is non-shivering, which occurs in [[brown adipose tissue]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19890013690.pdf|title=Acclimatization to cold in humans|last=Kaciuba-Uscilko|first=Hannah|last2=Greenleaf|first2=John|date=April 1, 1989|website=ntrs.nasa.gov/|publisher=United States|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heat ===
The only mechanism the human body has to cool itself is by [[Perspiration|sweat]] [[evaporation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Sweating occurs when the ambient air temperatures is above 28&amp;nbsp;°C (82&amp;nbsp;°F) and the body fails to return to the normal internal temperature.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The evaporation of the sweat helps cool the blood beneath the skin. It is limited by the amount of water available in the body, which can cause dehydration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Acclimatization ===
When humans are exposed to certain climates for extended periods of time, physiological changes occur to help the individual adapt to hot or cold climates. This helps the body conserve energy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Cold ====
The [[Inuit]] have more blood flowing into their extremities, and at a hotter temperature, than people living in warmer climates. A 1960 study on the [[Alacalufe people|Alacaluf Indians]] shows that they have a resting metabolic rate 150 to 200 percent higher than the white controls used. [[Sami people|Lapps]] do not have an increase in metabolic rate when sleeping, unlike non-acclimated people.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]] undergo a similar process, where the body cools but the metabolic rate does not increase.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Heat ====
Humans in Central Africa have been living in similar tropical climates for at least 40,000 years, which means that they have similar thermoregulatory systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A study done on the [[Bantu peoples|Bantus]] of South Africa showed that Bantus have a lower sweat rate than that of acclimated and nonacclimated whites. A similar study done on Australian aborigines produced similar results, with aborigines having a much lower sweat rate than whites.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Culture ==
Social adaptations enabled early modern humans to occupy environments with temperatures that were drastically different from that of Africa. (Potts 1998). Culture enabled humans to expand their range to areas that would otherwise be uninhabitable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Cold ===
Humans have been able to occupy areas of extreme cold through clothing, buildings, and manipulation of fire. [[Furnace]]s have further enabled the occupation of cold environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Australian aborigines only wear genital coverings for clothes, but studies have shown that the warmth from the fires they build is enough to keep the body from fighting heat loss through shivering.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Eskimos use well-insulated houses that are designed to transfer heat from an energy source to the living area, which means that the average indoor temperature for coastal Eskimos is 10 to 20&amp;nbsp;°C (50-68&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Heat ===
Humans inhabit hot climates, both dry and [[Humidity|humid]], and have done so for thousands of years. Selective use of clothing and technological inventions such as [[air conditioning]] allows humans to thrive in hot climates.

One example is the [[Bedouin|Chaamba Arabs]], who live in the [[Sahara|Sahara Desert]]. They wear clothing that traps air in between skin and the clothes, preventing the high ambient air temperature from reaching the skin.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Genetic adaptations ==
There has been very little research done in the genetics behind adaptations to heat and cold stress. Data suggests that certain parts of the [[human genome]] have only been [[Natural selection|selected]] for recently. Research on gene-culture interaction has been successful in linking agriculture and [[lactose]] tolerance. However, most evidence of links between culture and selection has not been proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laland|first=Kevin N.|last2=Odling-Smee|first2=John|last3=Myles|first3=Sean|title=How culture shaped the human genome: bringing genetics and the human sciences together|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nrg2734|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|volume=11|issue=2|pages=137–148|doi=10.1038/nrg2734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Colloquis''', previously known as ActiveBuddy and Conversagent, was a company that created conversation-based interactive agents originally distributed via [[instant messaging]] platforms. The company had offices in New York, NY and [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale, CA]].

Founded in 2000, the company was the brainchild of [[Robert Hoffer]], Timothy Kay and Peter Levitan. The idea for interactive agents (also known as [[Internet bots]]) came from the team's vision to add functionality to increasingly popular instant messaging services. The original implementation took shape as a word-based adventure game but quickly grew to include a wide range of database applications including access to news, weather, stock information, movie times, yellow pages listings, and detailed sports data, as well as a variety of tools (calculators, translator, etc.). These various applications were bundled into a single entity and launched as [[SmarterChild]] in 2001. SmarterChild acted as a showcase for the quick data access and possibilities for fun conversation that the company planned to turn into customized, niche specific products. 

The rapid success of SmarterChild led to targeted promotional products for Radiohead, Austin Powers, The Sporting News, and others. ActiveBuddy sought to strengthen its hold on the interactive agent market for the future by filing for, and receiving, a controversial&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/1446781 "Naraine, Ryan; “ActiveBuddy’s Patent Win Riles IM Bot Developers”; internetnews.com; August 15, 2002"]&lt;/ref&gt; patent on their creation in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|6430602}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also released the BuddyScript SDK, a free developer kit that allow programmers to design and launch their own interactive agents using ActiveBuddy’s [[proprietary programming language|proprietary scripting language]], in 2002. Ultimately, however, the decline in ad spending in 2001 and 2002 led to a shift in corporate strategy towards business focused Automated Service Agents, building products for clients including Cingular, Comcast and Cox Communications. The company subsequently changed its name from ActiveBuddy to Conversagent in 2003, and then again to Colloquis in 2006. Colloquis was later purchased by Microsoft in October 2006.

Most of the ActiveBuddy, Colloquis and Microsoft team that launched and nurtured SmarterChild is now working on AB2.

The [[Kaggle]] - "the world's largest community of data scientists compete to solve most valuable problems".

==Conversational behaviour==
The [[Loebner prize]] is an annual competition to determine the best [[Turing test]] competitors. The winner is the computer system that, in the judges' opinions, demonstrates the "most human" conversational behaviour, they have an additional prize for a system that in their opinion passes a Turing test. This second prize has not yet been awarded.

==Automatic control==

===Pilotless aircraft===
[[Image:VT Searching.png|thumb|right|200px|International Aerial Robotics Competition]]
The [[International Aerial Robotics Competition]] is a long-running event begun in 1991 to advance the state of the art in fully autonomous air vehicles.  This competition is restricted to university teams (although industry and governmental sponsorship of teams is allowed).  Key to this event is the creation of flying robots which must complete complex missions without any human intervention.  Successful entries are able to interpret their environment and make real-time decisions based only on a high-level mission directive (e.g., "find a particular target inside a building having certain characteristics which is among a group of buildings 3 kilometers from the aerial robot launch point").  In 2000, a $30,000 prize was awarded during the 3rd Mission (search and rescue), and in 2008, $80,000 in prize money was awarded at the conclusion of the 4th Mission (urban reconnaissance).

===Driverless cars===
[[Image:desertToCity.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Darpa Grand Challenge]]
The [[DARPA Grand Challenge]] is a series of competitions to promote [[driverless car]] technology, aimed at a congressional mandate stating that by 2015 one-third of the operational ground combat vehicles of the US Armed Forces should be unmanned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.darpa.mil/grandchallenge04/sponsor_toolkit/congress_lang.pdf Congressional Mandate] DARPA&lt;/ref&gt; While the first race had no winner, the second awarded a $2 million prize for the autonomous navigation of a hundred-mile trail, using [[GPS]], computers and a sophisticated array of sensors. In November 2007, DARPA introduced the [[DARPA Urban Challenge]], a sixty-mile urban area race requiring vehicles to navigate through traffic. In November 2010 the US Armed Forces extended the competition with the $1.6 million prize [[Multi Autonomous Ground-robotic International Challenge]] to consider cooperation between multiple vehicles in a simulated-combat situation.

[[Roborace]] will be a global motorsport championship with [[Autonomous car|autonomously driving]], [[Electric vehicle|electrically powered]] vehicles. The series will be run as a support series during the [[Formula E]] championship for electric vehicles.&lt;ref name="announcement"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiaformulae.com/en/news/2015/november/formula-e-kinetik-announce-roborace-a-global-driverless-championship.aspx|title=Formula E &amp; Kinetik announce driverless support series|publisher=fiaformulae.com|date=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will be the first global championship for driverless cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2015/11/28/formula-e-roborace/|title=Formula E is planning the first racing series for driverless cars|publisher=engadget.com|date=2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Data-mining and prediction==
The [[Netflix Prize]] was a competition for the best [[collaborative filtering]] [[algorithm]] that predicts user ratings for [[film]]s, based on previous ratings.  The competition was held by [[Netflix]], an online [[DVD]]-rental service.  The prize was $1,000,000.

The Pittsburgh Brain Activity Interpretation Competition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebc.pitt.edu/PBAIC.html The Experience Based Cognition Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310070925/http://www.ebc.pitt.edu/PBAIC.html |date=2008-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; will reward analysis of [[fMRI]] data "to predict what individuals perceive and how they act and feel in a novel Virtual Reality world involving searching for and collecting objects, interpreting changing instructions, and avoiding a threatening dog."  The prize in 2007 was $22,000.

The Face Recognition Grand Challenge (May 2004 to March 2006) aimed to promote and advance face recognition technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://face.nist.gov/frgc/ NIST Face Recognition Grand Challenge&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Meteorological Society]]'s artificial intelligence competition involves learning a [[classifier (mathematics)|classifier]] to characterise precipitation based on meteorological analyses of environmental conditions and polarimetric radar data.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/ai2008/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cooperation and coordination==

The SUMO prize is an annual prize for the best open source ontology extension of the [[Suggested Upper Merged Ontology|Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO)]], a formal theory of terms and logical definitions describing the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ontologyportal.org/prize.html The Annual SUMO Prize&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509192629/http://www.ontologyportal.org/prize.html |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize is $3000.

The [[Hutter Prize|Hutter Prize for Lossless Compression of Human Knowledge]] is a cash prize which rewards compression improvements on a specific 100 MB English text file. The prize awards 500 euros for each one percent improvement, up to €50,000. The organizers believe that text compression and AI are equivalent problems and 3 prizes were already given, at around € 2k.

The Cyc TPTP Challenge is a competition to develop reasoning methods for the [[Cyc]] comprehensive ontology and database of everyday common sense knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opencyc.org/doc/tptp_challenge_problem_set&lt;/ref&gt;  The prize is 100 euros for "each winner of two related challenges".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opencyc.org/announce/Cyc%20ATP%20Challenges%20at%20CASC-J4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Eternity II]] challenge was a [[constraint satisfaction]] problem very similar to the [[Tetravex]] game.  The objective is to lay 256 tiles on a 16x16 grid while satisfying a number of constraints.  The problem is known to be [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.ipl.2006.04.010 | volume=99 | title=Tetravex is NP-complete | journal=Information Processing Letters | pages=171–174| arxiv=0903.1147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prize was US$2,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.eternityii.com/competition-rules-eternity-2/&lt;/ref&gt; The competition ended in December 2010.

==Games==
The [[World Computer Chess Championship]] has been held since 1970.  The [[International Computer Games Association]] continues to hold an annual [[Computer Olympiad]] which includes this event plus computer competitions for many other games.

The Ing Prize was a substantial money prize attached to the World [[Computer Go]] Congress, starting from 1985 and expiring in 2000.  It was a graduated set of handicap challenges against young professional players with increasing prizes as the handicap was lowered.  At the time it expired in 2000, the unclaimed prize was 400,000 NT dollars for winning a 9-stone handicap match.

The AAAI [[General Game Playing]] Competition is a competition to develop programs that are effective at [[General Game Playing|general game playing]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://games.stanford.edu/competition/competition.html General Game Playing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629220940/http://games.stanford.edu/competition/competition.html |date=2008-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaai.org/Conferences/AAAI/2007/aaai07game.php AAAI-07 General Game Playing Competition&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Given a definition of a game, the program must play it effectively without human intervention.  Since the game is not known in advance the competitors cannot especially adapt their programs to a particular scenario.  The prize in 2006 and 2007 was $10,000.

The General Video Game AI Competition (GVGAI&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvgai.net General Video Game AI Competition]&lt;/ref&gt;) poses the problem of creating artificial intelligence that can play a wide, and in principle unlimited, range of games. Concretely, it tackles the problem of devising an algorithm that is able to play any game it is given, even if the game is not known a priori. Additionally, the contests poses the challenge of creating level and rule generators for any game is given. This area of study can be seen as an approximation of General Artificial Intelligence, with very little room for game dependent heuristics. The competition runs yearly in different tracks: single player planning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGAI2014Competition.pdf Single Player Planning GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt;, two-player planning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGAI20162PCompetition.pdf Two-Player Planning GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt;, single player learning&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liujialin.tech/publications/GVGAISingleLearning_manual.pdf Single Player Learning GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt;, level&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGLG.pdf Level Generation GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt; and rule&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/GVGRuleGeneration.pdf Rule Generation GVGAI]&lt;/ref&gt; generation, and each track prizes ranging from 200 to 500 US dollars for winners and runner-ups.

The 2007 Ultimate Computer Chess Challenge was a competition organised by [[FIDE|World Chess Federation]] that pitted
[[Deep Fritz]] against [[Deep Junior]].  The prize was $100,000.

The annual [[Arimaa#Arimaa Challenge|Arimaa Challenge]] offered a $10,000 prize until the year 2020 to develop a program that plays the board game [[Arimaa]] and defeats a group of selected human opponents. In 2015, David Wu's bot bot_sharp beat the humans, losing only 2 games out of 9.&lt;ref&gt;http://arimaa.com/arimaa/challenge/2015/showGames.cgi&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Arimaa Challenge was declared over and David Wu received the prize of $12,000 ($2,000 being offered by third-parties for 2015's championship).

[[2K Australia]] is offering a prize worth A$10,000 to develop a game-playing bot that plays a [[first-person shooter]].  The aim is to convince a panel of judges that it is actually a human player. The competition started in 2008 and was won in 2012. A new competition is planned for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.botprize.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Google AI Challenge]]&lt;ref&gt;http://ai-contest.com/index.php{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; was a bi-annual online contest organized by the [[University of Waterloo]] Computer Science Club and sponsored by [[Google]] that ran from 2009 to 2011. Each year a game was chosen and contestants submitted specialized [[computer game bot|automated bots]] to play against other competing bots.

[[Cloudball]] had its first round in Spring 2012 and finished on June 15. It is an international artificial intelligence programming contest, where users continuously submit the actions their soccer teams will take in each time step, in simple high level C# code.

==Glock's religiosity measure==
This term ''consequences'' as the result of one's [[religiosity]] first appeared in [[Charles Y. Glock]]'s five-dimensional religiosity measure. In the 1960s, Glock attempted to categorize the components of religiosity. In his five-dimensional scheme "consequences" are listed as the final dimension of religiosity. Glock theorized that certain consequences in a person's life can be attributed to religious living. Consequences of religiosity may include emotional and physical health, spiritual well-being, personal, marital, and family happiness. This, however, does not preclude the possibility of these factors working in the reverse as health, happiness and the like may interact with and have an influence on one's level of religiosity.{{sfnm |1a1=Cornwall |1a2=Albrecht |1a3=Cunningham |1a4=Pitcher |1y=1986 |2a1=Glock |2y=1972}}

==Criticism of the term==
Glock's consequential dimension of religiosity was criticized by some sociologists as they saw Glock's final dimension as ''consequence of'' religiosity and not a ''dimension of'' it.{{sfnm |1a1=Fichter |1y=1969 |2a1=Payne |2a2=Elifson |2y=1976}}

The '''conservation and restoration of frescoes''' is the process of caring for and maintaining [[fresco]]s, and includes documentation, examination, research, and treatment to insure their long-term viability, when desired.

== Technology==
[[Fresco]] is a technique of mural painting in which pigment is applied to freshly-laid or wet lime plaster. Water acts as a type of binding agent that allows the pigment to merge with the plaster, and once the plaster sets the painting becomes an integral part of the wall.

===Materials (chemical make-up)===
[[File:LIME CYCLE.jpg|thumb|Lime cycle]]
Fresco chemicals consist of the following:
* Silicon dioxide (sand)
* Calcium oxide (quick lime)
* Dihydrogen oxide (water)
* Calcium hydroxide (slaked lime)
* Carbon dioxide 
* Calcium carbonate (limestone)

Calcium carbonate (limestone) is decomposed by heat to produce calcium oxide (quicklime) and carbon dioxide gas. Then calcium oxide reacts with water to form calcium hydroxide (slaked lime) which is accompanied by the release of heat, a reaction known as exothermic.&lt;ref&gt;Gardinali, Piero R. [http://www2.fiu.edu/~gardinal/class_syllabi/IDS4290%20FALL2010/Lecture%2010%20frescos.pdf "Chemistry and Fresco Painting".] Florida International University. Retrieved 19 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pigments used from Antiquity to the early 19th century===

* Carbon black - created by heating wood or other plant material (amphorous carbon)
* Bone black - charring of bones or waste ivory in absence of air (10% carbon, 84% calcium phosphate, 6% carbon carbonate)
* Umber - Natural minerals red bole and cinnabrese with silica and clay attributing to its color (iron(III)-oxide, manganese oxide, aluminum oxide)     
* Red ochre - natural minerals containing silica and clay some of which is composed of iron oxide and hematite (anhydrous iron(III)-oxide)
* Yellow ochre - natural minerals that contain silica and clay, and attributing to its color, goethite (iron oxyhydroxide)
* Lime white - chalk (calcium carbonate and calcite)
* Madder lake - an extract from the root of the madder plant (rubia tintorum)
* Carmine lake - an extract from two types of scale insects: the cochineal and kermes
* Realgar - natural mineral (arsenic sulfide)
* Malachite - natural mineral (basic copper carbonate)
* Orpiment - natural mineral (arsenic sulfide)
* Egyptian blue - first artificial pigment and only used during antiquity (calcium copper silicate)
* Indigo - plant base pigment derived from the woad plant (Isatis tinctoria L.)
* Red lead - natural mineral minium (lead(II,IV)-oxide)
* Green earth - natural minerals glauconite or celadonite (aluminum silicate)

== Deterioration of frescoes ==
[[File:Hades abducting Persephone.jpg|thumb|Hades abducting Persephone]]
Frescoes can be found in places of worship such as churches, ancient temples and tombs, as well as private residences and commercial establishments used for public entertainment.  It is these environments and their pollutants that interact with the chemicals, both organic and inorganic, utilized to create the frescoes and the pigments used that contribute to their aesthetic and structural deterioration.  Additionally, wall paintings such as frescoes depending on the technique used, possess a layered structure consisting of support, ground or paint layer.  These constituents of wall paintings undergo deterioration physically, chemically or biologically. Although factors like moisture, salts, and atmospheric pollution have generally been the main contributors to the deterioration of wall paintings in most cases, many in the field believe the growth of biological agencies like fungi and microbial flora is also responsible for decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garg|first1=K.L|last2=Jain|first2=Kamal|last3=Mishra|first3=A.K|title=Role of Fungi in the Deterioration of Wall Paintings|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1995|volume=167|pages=255–271|url=http://data2.xjlas.ac.cn:81/UploadFiles/sdz/cnki/%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87/ELSEVIER/deterioration(environment%20science)/1.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2015|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(95)04587-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical degradation ==
The presence of pigment discoloration, stains and the formation of bio-film are indicative of chemical degradation. Given the variety of organic and inorganic molecules present in frescoes, many type of micro-organisms may grow on the substrate of the fresco provided that environmental conditions (humidity, temperature, light, and pH) are fostered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ciferri|first1=Orio|title=Microbial Degradation of Paintings|journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology|date=March 1999|volume=65|issue=3|pages=879–885|pmc=91117|pmid=10049836}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical deterioration can be attributed to fungi through their metabolites either by assimilation or dissimulation processes. In the assimilation process, the fungi use the components of frescoes as a carbon source through enzyme production, whereas in the dissimulation process, the decay is mainly by the excretion of waste products or secretion of metabolic intermediates including acids and pigments which can damage, stain or disfigure the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garg|first1=K.L|last2=Jain|first2=Kamal|last3=Mishra|first3=A.K.|title=Role of Fungi in the Deterioration of Wall Paintings|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1995|volume=167|pages=255–271|url=http://data2.xjlas.ac.cn:81/UploadFiles/sdz/cnki/%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87/ELSEVIER/deterioration(environment%20science)/1.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2015|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(95)04587-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical degradation==
[[File:Fresco in the Terrace Houses in Ephesus (6).JPG|thumb|Fresco in the terrace houses in Ephesus]]
Signs of cracking and disintegration of paint layers and the formation of paint blisters is indicative of physical/structural degradation.  Industrial pollutants contain gases and burning fossil fuels which react with oxygen and water to produce sulfuric acid and nitric acids.  These acids convert calcium carbonate (limestone) to calcium sulfate which becomes soluble in the water and it forms large crystals within the surface layer causing the fresco to blister and flake off.&lt;ref&gt;Gardinali, Piero R. "Chemistry and Fresco Painting".[http://www2.fiu.edu/~gardinal/class_syllabi/IDS4290%20FALL2010/Lecture%2010%20frescos.pdf] Florida International University. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the adverse effects of environmental pollutants, fungal growth either on or below the surface can cause the dislodging of the paint layers further contributing to the physical and structural degradation of frescoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garg|first1=K.L|last2=Kaml|first2=Jain|last3=Mishra|first3=A.K|title=Role of Fungi in the Deterioration of Wall Paintings|journal=The Science of the Total Environment|date=1995|volume=167|pages=255–271|url=http://data2.xjlas.ac.cn:81/UploadFiles/sdz/cnki/%E5%A4%96%E6%96%87/ELSEVIER/deterioration(environment%20science)/1.pdf|doi=10.1016/0048-9697(95)04587-q}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventive care ==
Frescoes that have been removed from their original context and relocated to cultural institutions have the benefit of being in a more stable environment that is consistently monitored, even though they are at low risk. However, for frescoes still at their place of origin, such as cultural heritage sites, are at high risk because they are vulnerable to environmental elements due to a high volume of tourist traffic in conjunction with other pollutants.  Therefore, as with any similar object, data loggers are useful to monitor ambient conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, as well as thermohygrometric sensors for micro-climate monitoring for fresco paintings in indoor, outdoor or semi-confined environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Merello|first1=P.|last2=Garcia-Diego|first2=F.|last3=Zarzo,|first3=M.|title=Microclimate Monitoring of Aridane's House (Pompeii, Italy) for Preventive Conservation of Fresco Painting|journal=Chemistry Central|date=2012|volume=6|issue=145|pmc=3541997|pmid=23190798|doi=10.1186/1752-153X-6-145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cleaning methods ==
Cleaning aims to restore artworks to how the artist intended them to look; however, how an artwork is cleaned will depend on the nature of the material to be removed. With paintings, a variety of organic solvents are used, but the most common solvent is water, often with chelating agents, surfactants or salts to control pH. Applying solutions through tissues, gels and sponges is becoming the norm, due to the level of control offered by holding the cleaning system at the upper surface of the art. Such gels, introduced in the late 1980s, are usually water-based emulsions thickened with cellulose or synthetic polymers. By slowly releasing the solvent, they prevent some of the swelling damage that free solvents cause to paint layers. During the 1960s, it became popular to use synthetic polymers to consolidate and stabilise frescoes – plaster-based wall paintings. They seemed like the perfect replacement for the wax coatings previously used, but over time it became clear that this was not the case. Their presence drastically changed the paintings’ surface properties, causing mechanical stresses and crystallisation of salts beneath the painting leading to accelerated disintegration. In addition, the polymers themselves became discoloured and brittle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the mid-1990s, laser cleaning was established for stone and started to be used for other materials such as gilded bronzes and frescoes. A major breakthrough came when an Italian physicist at the National Research Council Institute of Applied Physics in Florence, Salvatore Siano, developed a method that used even shorter pulses, of only micro- to nanosecond duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major innovation in the last decade is the use of colloid science and nanotechnology in conservation. In the mid 1990s colloid scientist Piero Baglioni came up with a microemulsion: a clear mixture of organic solvent and water, stabilised with a surfactant that sits at the interface between the water and organic phases.  Another unusual method of cleaning frescoes is with the use of specific types of bacteria to remove inorganic crusts and animal glues from frescoes. Because bacteria can produce a whole host of enzymes they can deal with complex cleaning problems, metabolising organic and inorganic matter into hydrogen sulfide, molecular nitrogen or carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repair and restoration techniques ==
[[File:IMG 6172 - MI - Sant'Eustorgio - Sottocoro - Restauratrice - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 1-Mar-2007.jpg|thumb|IMG 6172 - MI - Sant'Eustorgio - Sottocoro - Restauratrice - Foto Giovanni Dall'Orto - 1-Mar-2007]]
During the 18th century, new techniques were perfected for the restoration and conservation of ancient works of art, including methods of detaching fresco paintings from walls. Detachment involves separating the layer of paint from its natural backing, generally stone or brick, and can be categorized according to the removal technique used.

The oldest method, known as the a massello technique, involves cutting the wall and removing a considerable part of it together with both layers of plaster and the fresco painting itself.

The stacco technique, on the other hand, involves removing only the preparatory layer of plaster, called the arriccio together with the painted surface.

Finally, the strappo technique, without doubt the least invasive, involves removing only the topmost layer of plaster, known as the intonachino, which has absorbed the pigments, without touching the underlying arriccio layer. In this method, a protective covering made from strips of cotton and animal glue is applied to the painted surface. A second, much heavier cloth, larger than the painted area, is then laid on top and a deep incision is made in the wall around the edges of the fresco. A rubber mallet is used to repeatedly strike the fresco so that it detaches from the wall. Using a removal tool, a sort of awl, the painting and the intonachino attached to the cloth and glue covering are then detached, from the bottom up.

The back of the fresco is thinned to remove excess lime and reconstructed with a permanent backing made from two thin cotton cloths, called velatini, and a heavier cloth with a layer of glue. Two layers of mortar are then applied; first a rough one and then a smoother, more compact layer.

The mortars make up the first real layer of the new backing. The velatini cloths and the heavier cloth serve only to facilitate future detachments, and are therefore known as the strato di sacrificio, or sacrificial layer. Once the mortar is dry, a layer of adhesive is applied and the fresco is attached to a rigid support made from synthetic material which can be used to reconstruct the architecture that originally housed the fresco. After the backing has completely dried, the cloth covering used to protect the front of the fresco during detachment is removed using a hot water spray and decoloured ethyl alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nocentini|first1=Serena|title='Strappo' Detachment|url=http://www.museobenozzogozzoli.it/technics/StrappoDetachment.html|publisher=Museo Benozzo Gozzoli|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Piero Baglioni has also pioneered the use of nanoparticles for repairing deteriorating frescoes. Artists generally painted directly onto wet calcium hydroxide plaster, which reacts with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form calcium carbonate (calcite). Over centuries, pollution and humidity causes the carbonate layer to break down and sulfate, nitrate and chloride salts within the walls recrystallize, leading to deterioration of the painted surface. Baglioni was sure that nanoparticles would improve on conventional conservation methods. His treatment injects calcium hydroxide nanoparticles dispersed in alcohol and their small size, just 10–100&amp;nbsp;nm, allows them to penetrate several centimetres into the frescoes and slowly reform the depleted calcite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brazil|first1=Rachel|title=Conservative Innovations|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2014/06/art-conservation|website=Chemistryworld|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antibiotics such as amoxicillin can be used to treat strains of bacteria living in a fresco's natural pigment which can turn them into powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avvisati|first1=Carlo|last2=McGivern|first2=Hannah|title=Pompeian Frescoes Cured with Antibiotics|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/conservation/pompeian-frescoes-cured-with-antibiotics/|publisher=The Art Newspaper|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another method of fresco repair is the application of a protection and support bandage of cotton gauze and polyvinyl alcohol. Difficult sections are removed with soft brushes and localized vacuuming. The other areas that are easier to remove (because they had been damaged by less water) are removed with a paper pulp compress saturated with bicarbonate of ammonia solutions and removed with deionized water. These sections are strengthened and reattached then cleansed with base exchange resin compresses, and the wall and pictorial layer are strengthened with barium hydrate.

=== Sistine Chapel ===

The [[Sistine Chapel]] was restored in the late 1970s and through the 1980s. This was one of the most significant, largest and longest art restoration projects in history. The entire project took twelve years to complete, not taking into account the inspections, planning and approval of the project. Among the many parts of the chapel that was restored, what drew the most attention were Michelangelo's frescoes.  The restoration sparked controversy. A number of experts criticized the proposed techniques, claiming that the restoration procedure would scrape off the layers of various materials on the frescoes, which would lead to damage beyond repair, and  that the removal of the materials would expose the pigments on the frescoes which were fragile and dated to artificial light, temperature variations, humidity and pollution. Such exposure, they feared, would cause massive damage to the original artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sistine Chapel Restoration Controversy|url=http://apecsec.org/sistine-chapel-restoration-controversy/|website=APECSEC.org|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villa of Mysteries in Pompeii===
[[File:Fresque des mytères, Pompéi.jpg|thumb|Fresque des mytères, Pompéi]]
For the frescos of [[Villa of the Mysteries]] in Pompeii, early conservation efforts sometimes involved removing frescoes, rebuilding or reinforcing the walls, and then reattaching the paintings. The first conservators also applied a coat of wax mixed with oil to clean the paintings’ surfaces, preserve the ancient pigments, and stabilize the fragile works, giving the frescoes a glossy appearance the ancient artists never intended them to have. At the same time, the wax filled in cracks in the surfaces, sealing moisture inside the walls, further weakening them by compromising the strength of the mortar holding the walls together. By 2013 the villa, like most of Pompeii, was in dire need of modern conservation, as was a protective covering that had been constructed in different phases throughout the years. Parts of paintings were crumbling from unstable walls and the mosaics had been severely damaged by millions of visitors’ feet. Repeated applications of wax had caused the pigments to oxidize and darken, and the frescoes to yellow, significantly altering their appearance. All the surface decorations of the villa, both mosaics and frescoes, had been conserved before, but in irregular ways. Some of the methods currently being employed have been used by decades of conservators at Pompeii. Frescoes have been cleaned by hand using a scalpel or a chemical solution. Painted surfaces have been consolidated with an acrylic resin diluted with deionized water and then injected into cracks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lobell|first1=Jaretta A.|title=Saving the Villa of the Mysteries|url=http://www.archaeology.org/issues/124-1403/features/1813-pompeii-saving-the-villa-of-the-mysteries|website=Archaeology Magazine|publisher=Archaeology Institute of America|accessdate=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the use of antibiotics for the removal of bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Avvisati|first1=Carlo|last2=McGivern|first2=Hannah|title=Pompeian Frescoes Cured with Antibiotics|url=http://theartnewspaper.com/news/conservation/pompeian-frescoes-cured-with-antibiotics/|website=The Art Newspaper|accessdate=7 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams today also have more high-tech tools at their disposal, including lasers to clean the frescoes, and ultrasound, thermal imaging, and radar to evaluate the level of decay of the walls and paintings. Drones are being used to examine the entirety of the villa's protective covering.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Prof. '''Davor Džalto''' (Давор Џалто: born May 17, 1980) is an [[artist]], [[art historian]], [[theologian]] and [[philosopher]] of [[Liberalism|liberal]] orientation born in [[Travnik]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He is also known as one of the most important [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]] [[Christian]] thinkers in the world today.&lt;ref&gt;(http://www.svspress.com/the-human-work-of-art-a-theological-appraisal-of-creativity-and-the-death-of-the-artist/)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Davor-dzalto.jpg|thumb|Davor Džalto]]

He graduated from the School of Art in [[Niš]]. His academic career started in [[Belgrade]] where he received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] from the [[University of Belgrade]] [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Philosophy|Faculty of Philosophy]] in the [[history of art]]. In 2004 he began writing his PhD thesis at the [[Albert-Ludwigs Universitaet]] in Freiburg, Germany (mentor Professor Dr. Angeli Janhsen), where he defended it successfully in 2006, becoming the youngest doctor of philosophy in the humanities in Germany and the South-East European region.&lt;ref&gt;(Ksenija Pavlovic, ''10/30 Exhibition Catalogue'', Belgrade: 2010, 5–6)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007 he has been a [[university professor]] of history and theory of art and of Orthodox Christian theology and [[religious studies]]. As a visiting and honorary professor he has taught at various universities in Europe and the US, including [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], [[Indiana University]], [[Fordham University]] of New York and [[The American University of Rome]]. He is also the [[president]] of The [[Institute]] for the Study of [[Culture]] and [[Christianity]].

His work is based on examination of the relations between [[personhood]] and [[authorship]], especially in the [[postmodern]] and [[globalization]] context. He has formulated a theory according to which art represents an [[Symbolic expression|expression]] of the [[personal identity]] of the human being, having an [[Existentialism|existential]] importance. That way he contributed to the revision of the [[postmodernism]], actualizing the question of possibility and meaning of the art creation. He continued to further develop theological concepts of [[John Zizioulas]] and philosophical statements given by [[Nikolai Berdyaev]], implementing them on the contemporary historical and cultural context. He also examines the concept of "[[simulacrum]]" in relation to the human person and its ability to create.

He also works in various media artistically including [[video art]], performance, painting, and sculpture.

His work has been presented at numerous exhibitions internationally. He has taken part in many conferences and seminars, having [[peace]] and inter-religious backgrounds. It is also held that he played an important role in [[South Eastern Europe]] in promoting peace, reconciliation and cooperation between religious communities, primarily because he has contacts among all important religions and religious leaders in the [[Balkans]] and in Europe. He was directly involved in many initiatives during his engagement in the [[Pax Christi]] office in Belgrade. He has written a number of articles and theoretical texts. As an 18-year-old student he published his first book, ''On Writings as an Artistic, Historical, Social and Cultural Phenomenon''. He is a founding member and the art director of the [[Flexible Art Network]] and vice president of the Christian Cultural Center. He lives and works in [[Freiburg]], [[Münster]] and [[Belgrade]]. Based on the ''Aesthetik der Absenz'', formulated in German-speaking art circles, he recognized and explained the phenomenon of "absence of body" in twentieth-century art. In 2007 his name was added to the list of 100 most influential people in the world, originating from the South Eastern European region.

[[File:Darwin's finches.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Darwin's finches]] are a clear and famous example of divergent evolution, in which an ancestral species [[adaptive radiation|radiates]] into a number of descendant species with both similar and different traits.]]

'''Divergent evolution''' or '''divergent selection''' is the accumulation of differences between closely related species populations, leading to [[speciation]]. Divergent evolution is typically exhibited when two populations become separated by a geographic barrier (such as in [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]] or [[peripatric speciation]]) and experience different [[natural selection|selective pressures]] that drive adaptions to their new environment. After many generations and continual evolution, the populations become [[reproductive isolation|unable to interbreed]] with one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/speciationmodes_05 |title=Sympatric speciation |publisher= |accessdate=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American naturalist [[J. T. Gulick]] (1832-1923) was the first to use the term "divergent evolution",&lt;ref name="Gulick"&gt;{{closed access}} {{cite journal |last=Gulick |first=John T. |authorlink=J. T. Gulick |title= Divergent Evolution through Cumulative Segregation |journal=Journal of the Linnean Society of London, Zoology |date=September 1888 |volume= 20 |issue=120 |pages=189–274 |doi=10.1111/j.1096-3642.1888.tb01445.x |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cNQUAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=editions:HARVARD32044106309446&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= 26 September 2011}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its use becoming widespread in modern evolutionary literature. Classic examples of divergence in nature are the [[adaptive radiation]] of the [[Darwin's finches|finches]] of the [[Galapagos]] or the coloration differences in populations of a species that live in different habitats such as with [[Rock pocket mouse|pocket mice]] and [[Eastern fence lizard|fence lizards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Evolution |edition=2nd |author=Carl T. Bergstrom and Lee Alan Dugatkin |date=2016 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |isbn=9780393937930 |pages=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term can also be applied in [[molecular evolution]], such as to [[protein]]s that derive from [[homology (biology)|homologous]] genes. Both orthologous genes (resulting from a speciation event) and paralogous genes (resulting from [[gene duplication]]) can illustrate divergent evolution. Through gene duplication, it is possible for divergent evolution to occur between two genes within a species. Similarities between species that have diverged are due to their common origin, so such similarities are homologies. In contrast, [[convergent evolution]] arises when an [[adaptation]] has arisen independently, creating [[analogous structures]] such as the wings of birds and of insects.

[[Image:EISCAT dish Kiruna.JPG|right|thumb|EISCAT Kiruna Radar (diameter 32m)]]

'''EISCAT''' ('''European Incoherent Scatter Scientific Association''') operates three [[incoherent scatter]] [[radar]] systems, at 224&amp;nbsp;MHz, 931&amp;nbsp;MHz in Northern [[Scandinavia]] and one at 500&amp;nbsp;MHz on [[Svalbard]], used to study the interaction between the [[Sun]] and the [[Earth]] as revealed by disturbances in the [[ionosphere]] and [[magnetosphere]]. At the Ramfjordmoen facility (near [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]]), it also operates an [[ionospheric heater]] facility, similar to [[HAARP]]. Additional receiver stations are located in [[Sodankylä]], [[Finland]], and [[Kiruna]], [[Sweden]]. The '''EISCAT Svalbard radar''' ('''ESR''') is located in [[Longyearbyen]], Norway. The EISCAT Headquarters are also located in [[Kiruna]].

EISCAT is funded and operated by research institutes and research councils of [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Japan]], [[China]] and the [[United Kingdom]] (the EISCAT Associates). Institutes in other countries also contribute to operations, including [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Germany]] and [[South Korea]].

The system was also tested for [[space debris]] [[space surveillance|tracking]] and the radars were proven to be capable of statistical observations of [[Low-Earth orbit]] (LEO) debris (altitudes of 500 to 1500&amp;nbsp;km) down to 2&amp;nbsp;cm in size. Since these measurements are insufficient to determine complete [[orbit]]s, the radar has only limited space surveillance value.&lt;ref name=bulletin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esapub/bulletin/bulletin133/bul133f_klinkrad.pdf|title=Europe's Eyes on the Skies|publisher=[[ESA]]|access-date=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the space debris tracking change is only a dedicated back-end computer system, the primary EISCAT observations are not compromised. As a result of that, the EISCAT radars allow continuous monitoring of the LEO debris in a [[beam park]] mode, functioning as a space surveillance system part of the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[Space Situational Awareness Programme]] (SSA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Operations/Space_Debris/Scanning_observing |title=ESA - Space Debris - Scanning &amp; observing|publisher=ESA|access-date=2015-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1973, the EISCAT proposal&amp;nbsp;— which was originally planned for France, Germany and the three Nordic countries&amp;nbsp;— seemed moribund. Then, Welsh physicist [[Granville Beynon]] became involved and by 1975, the agreement was signed, with the UK as a member. The proposal for UK membership had originally been turned down by the appropriate SRC committee. Beynon, however, persuaded the Board to reverse the decision of the committee and as a result of his efforts, hundreds of European scientists have had the opportunity to use the world's most advanced ionospheric radar.&lt;ref name=mist /&gt;

In 2008, [[Doritos]] embarked upon an "out-of-this-world" advertising campaign, literally beaming a 30-second advertisement for Doritos brand tortilla chips into a solar system 42 light years away. This project is in collaboration with EISCAT Space Centre in [[Svalbard]]. The "You Make It, We'll Play It" contest chose the winning advertisement that was transmitted on June 12, 2008. The ad was beamed towards a distant star, within the Ursa Major constellation which is orbited by planets which may harbor life.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;

== EISCAT facilities==
[[Image:Ramfjordmoen forskningsstasjon winter 1.jpg|right|thumb|EISCAT Ramfjordmoen facility (near Tromsø) in winter]]
[[Image:EISCAT Sodankylä radar.JPG|right|thumb|EISCAT Sodankylä receiver antenna (diameter 32m) after conversion to 224 MHz (crossed dipole replaced Cassegrain subreflector at focal point)]]

EISCAT operates several facilities north of the [[Scandinavia]]n [[arctic circle]].&lt;ref name=eiscat-new&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eiscat.se/about/whatiseiscat_new| title=What is EISCAT| publisher=EISCAT| access-date=2015-05-23| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151004043210/https://www.eiscat.se/about/whatiseiscat_new| archivedate=2015-10-04| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At Ramfjordmoen, near [[Tromsø]], Norway the EISCAT facility has: a [[Ionospheric heater]] with HF radar capabilities; a tristatic [[VHF]] radar at 224&amp;nbsp;MHz with a 4 x 30m-by-40m [[parabolic cylinder antenna]]; and a monostatic [[UHF]] radar at 931&amp;nbsp;MHz with a 32 m [[parabolic dish antenna]].&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eiscat.se/scientist/document/technical-specifications/| title=The EISCAT facilities| publisher=EISCAT| access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the start in 1981 the [[UHF]] radar was a steerable tristatic system, but due to interference from telecommunications in the 930 MHZ band, the remote receivers were converted to receive the VHF signal during 2012.
* At [[Kiruna]], EISCAT operates a 32 m parabolic dish antenna receiver which was originally part of the tristatic UHF system but was converted to receive the VHF frequency (224&amp;nbsp;MHz) during 2012.&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities /&gt;
* At [[Sodankylä]], Finland, EISCAT also operates a 32 m VHF-band parabolic dish antenna receiver working at 224&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities /&gt;
* At [[Longyearbyen]], on the Norwegian [[Svalbard]] archipelago, EISCAT operates the EISCAT Svalbard radar (ESR). It consists of a 32 m steerable parabolic dish antenna and a 42 m field aligned antenna, operating at 500&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=eiscat-new /&gt;&lt;ref name=eiscat-facilities /&gt;

The Tromsø VHF transmitter, together with the Kiruna and Sodankylä VHF receivers, form a [[multistatic radar]] system.

Additionally, the [[KAIRA|Kilpisjärvi Atmospheric Imaging Receiver Array]] (KAIRA), near [[Kilpisjärvi]], Finland can also serve as a VHF receiver in conjunction with the Tromsø transmitter.&lt;ref name=kira&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sgo.fi/KAIRA/| title=SGO: KAIRA| publisher=SGO| access-date=2015-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EISCAT 3D==

EISCAT is planning on building a next generation radar capable of providing 3D monitoring of the atmosphere and ionosphere. The new system is called '''EISCAT_3D'''.

In 2008, the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures selected EISCAT_3D for its "Roadmap 2008 for Large-Scale European Research Infrastructures for the next 20–30 years."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiscat3d.se/idea "What is Eiscat 3D?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

EISCAT_3D will be a [[multistatic radar]] composed of five [[phased-array radar|phased-array]] antenna fields. each field will have around 10,000 crossed [[dipole antenna]] elements. All five sites will act as receivers, with a single core site transmitting at 233&amp;nbsp;MHz (VHF band). The sites will be spread over Finland, Norway and Sweden. Each site will have a central array, surrounded by a set of smaller arrays, providing a high spatial resolution via  [[aperture synthesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eiscat3d.se/status2015/configuration| title=EISCAT_3D System configuration| access-date=2015-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Preparations for EISCAT_3D ===
During the summer of 2017, EISCAT will build a 91-element subarray at the site at Ramfjordmoen for hardware testing purposes and the full system is expected to be operational around 2021.
The [[KAIRA]] system is also a pathfinder for the development of EISCAT_3D.&lt;ref name=kira /&gt;

The '''Edmund key''' is a variant of the [[Ortman Key]]. It is a [[coupling]] device used to secure two adjacent cylindrical segments of a [[pressure vessel]] common in tactical [[rocket motor]]s.  The key is made of elongated rectangular metal bar stock, such as steel, and is inserted into juxtaposed annular grooves around the circumference of the mating parts.  An Edmund key also provides a feature at the end of the key to allow the key to be extracted from the groove for disassembly.

[[Image:FirehoseNbody.png|thumb|right|300px|Fig. 1. The firehose instability in an [[N-body simulation]] of a [[prolate]] [[elliptical galaxy]]. Time progresses top–down, from upper left to lower right.  Initially, the long-to-short axis ratio of the galaxy is 10:1.  After the instability has run its course, the axis ratio is approximately 3:1. Note the boxy shape of the final galaxy, similar to the shapes of [[barred spiral galaxy|bars]] observed in many [[spiral galaxy|spiral galaxies]].
]]
The '''firehose instability''' (or '''hose-pipe instability''') is a dynamical [[instability]] of thin or elongated [[Galaxy|galaxies]]. The instability causes the galaxy to buckle or bend in a direction perpendicular to its long axis.  After the instability has run its course, the galaxy is less elongated (i.e. rounder) than before. Any sufficiently thin stellar system, in which some component of the internal velocity is in the form of random or counter-streaming motions (as opposed to [[rotation]]), is subject to the instability.

The firehose instability is probably responsible for the fact that [[elliptical galaxies]] and [[dark matter halo]]es never have axis ratios more extreme than about 3:1, since this is roughly the axis ratio at which the instability sets in.&lt;ref name="FP84"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or with beads sliding along an oscillating string.&lt;ref&gt;In spite of its name, the firehose instability is not related dynamically to the oscillatory motion of a hose spewing water from its nozzle.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stability analysis: sheets and wires==

The firehose instability can be analyzed exactly in the case of an infinitely thin, self-gravitating sheet of stars.&lt;ref name="Toomre66"/&gt; If the sheet experiences a small displacement &lt;math&gt;h(x,t)&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; direction, the vertical acceleration for stars of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; velocity &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; as they move around the bend is

:&lt;math&gt;
a_z = \left({\partial\over\partial t} + u{\partial\over\partial x}\right)^2h = 
{\partial^2h\over\partial t^2} + 2u {\partial^2h\over\partial t \partial x} + u^2 {\partial^2h\over\partial x^2},\,
&lt;/math&gt;

provided the bend is small enough that the horizontal velocity is unaffected. Averaged over all stars at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, this acceleration must equal the gravitational restoring force per unit mass &lt;math&gt;F_x&lt;/math&gt;. In a frame chosen such that the mean streaming motions are zero, this relation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
{\partial^2h\over\partial t^2} + \sigma_u^2 {\partial^2h\over\partial x^2} - F_z(x,t) =0,\,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma_u&lt;/math&gt; is the horizontal velocity dispersion in that frame.

For a perturbation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;
h(x,t)=H\exp\left[i\left(kx-\omega t\right)\right]
&lt;/math&gt;
the gravitational restoring force is
:&lt;math&gt;
F_z(x,t) = -G\Sigma\int_{-\infty}^\infty dy' \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}
{\left[ h(x,t) - h(x',t)\right]\over \left[(x-x')^2+(y-y')^2\right]^{3/2}}dx'
= -2\pi G\Sigma k h(x,t)
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is the surface mass density. The [[dispersion relation]] for a thin self-gravitating sheet is then&lt;ref name="Toomre66"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\omega^2 = 2\pi G\Sigma k - \sigma_u^2 k^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term, which arises from the perturbed gravity, is stabilizing, while the second term, due to the [[centrifugal force]] that the stars exert on the sheet, is destabilizing.

For sufficiently long wavelengths:

:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda =2\pi/k &gt; \lambda_J = \sigma_u^2/G\Sigma
&lt;/math&gt;

the gravitational restoring force dominates, and the sheet is stable; while at short wavelengths the sheet is unstable. The firehose instability is precisely complementary, in this sense, to the [[Jeans instability]] in the plane, which is ''stabilized'' at short wavelengths, &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt; \lambda_J&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="KMC71"&gt;{{Citation

==Stability analysis: finite-thickness galaxies==

At wavelengths shorter than the actual vertical thickness of a galaxy, the bending is stabilized.  The reason is that stars in a finite-thickness galaxy oscillate vertically with an unperturbed frequency &lt;math&gt;\kappa_z&lt;/math&gt;; like any oscillator, the phase of the star's response to the imposed bending depends entirely on whether the forcing frequency &lt;math&gt;ku&lt;/math&gt; is greater than or less than its natural frequency.  If &lt;math&gt;ku&gt;\kappa_z&lt;/math&gt; for most stars, the overall density response to the perturbation will produce a gravitational potential opposite to that imposed by the bend and the disturbance will be damped.&lt;ref name="MS94"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These arguments imply that a sufficiently thick galaxy (with low &lt;math&gt;\kappa_z&lt;/math&gt;) will be stable to bending at all wavelengths, both short and long.

Analysis of the linear normal modes of a finite-thickness slab shows that bending is indeed stabilized when the ratio of vertical to horizontal velocity dispersions exceeds about 0.3.&lt;ref name="Toomre66"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Since the elongation of a stellar system with this anisotropy is approximately 15:1 — much more extreme than observed in real galaxies — bending instabilities were believed for many years to be of little importance.  However, Fridman &amp; Polyachenko showed &lt;ref name="FP84"/&gt; that the critical axis ratio for stability of homogeneous (constant-density) [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]] and prolate spheroids was roughly 3:1, not 15:1 as implied by the infinite slab, and Merritt &amp; Hernquist&lt;ref name="MH91"/&gt; found a similar result in an [[N-body simulation|N-body]] study of inhomogeneous prolate spheroids (Fig. 1).

The discrepancy was resolved in 1994.&lt;ref name="MS94"/&gt;  The gravitational restoring force from a bend is substantially weaker in finite or inhomogeneous galaxies than in infinite sheets and slabs, since there is less matter at large distances to contribute to the restoring force. As a result, the long-wavelength modes are not stabilized by gravity, as implied by the dispersion relation derived above.  In these more realistic models, a typical star feels a vertical forcing frequency from a long-wavelength bend that is roughly twice the frequency &lt;math&gt;\Omega_z&lt;/math&gt; of its unperturbed orbital motion along the long axis.  Stability to global bending modes then requires that this forcing frequency be greater than &lt;math&gt;\Omega_z&lt;/math&gt;, the frequency of orbital motion parallel to the short axis.  The resulting (approximate) condition

:&lt;math&gt;
2\Omega_x &gt; \Omega_z\,
&lt;/math&gt;

predicts stability for homogeneous prolate spheroids rounder than 2.94:1, in excellent agreement with the normal-mode calculations of Fridman &amp; Polyachenko&lt;ref name="FP84"/&gt; and with N-body simulations of homogeneous oblate&lt;ref name="Jessop97"&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/ref&gt; and inhomogeneous prolate &lt;ref name=MH91/&gt; galaxies.

The situation for [[spiral galaxy|disk]] galaxies is more complicated, since the shapes of the dominant modes depend on whether the internal velocities are azimuthally or radially biased.  In oblate galaxies with radially-elongated velocity ellipsoids, arguments similar to those given above suggest that an axis ratio of roughly 3:1 is again close to critical, in agreement with N-body simulations for thickened disks.&lt;ref name="SM94"&gt;{{Citation

| bibcode=1994ApJ...425..530S}}
&lt;/ref&gt; If the stellar velocities are azimuthally biased, the orbits are approximately circular and so the dominant modes are angular (corrugation) modes, &lt;math&gt;\delta z \propto e^{im\phi}&lt;/math&gt;. The approximate condition for stability becomes

:&lt;math&gt;
m\Omega&gt;\kappa_z\,
&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; the circular orbital frequency.

==Importance==
The firehose instability is believed to play an important role in determining the structure of both [[spiral galaxy|spiral]] and [[elliptical galaxy|elliptical]] galaxies and of [[dark matter halo]]es.

* As noted by [[Edwin Hubble]] and others, elliptical galaxies are rarely if ever observed to be more elongated than [[Galaxy morphological classification|E6 or E7]], corresponding to a maximum axis ratio of about 3:1.  The firehose instability is probably responsible for this fact, since an elliptical galaxy that formed with an initially more elongated shape would be unstable to bending modes, causing it to become rounder.
* Simulated [[dark matter halo]]es, like elliptical galaxies, never have elongations greater than about 3:1.  This is probably also a consequence of the firehose instability.&lt;ref name="Bett07"&gt;{{citation

In some cases, subpopulations living in ecologically distinct peripheral environments can exhibit genetic divergence from the remainder of a population, especially where the range of a population is very large (see [[parapatric speciation]]). The genetic differences among divergent populations can involve [[silent mutations]] (that have no effect on the [[phenotype]]) or give rise to significant [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and/or [[physiology|physiological]] changes. Genetic divergence will always accompany reproductive isolation, either due to novel adaptations via selection and/or due to genetic drift, and is the principal mechanism underlying [[speciation]].&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.boundless.com/biology/textbooks/boundless-biology-textbook/evolution-and-the-origin-of-species-18/evolution-of-genomes-127/gene-duplications-and-divergence-511-13091/

[[Australian rules football]] is a sport played in many countries around the world at amateur level only.  In 2016, about 106,000 people played in structured competitions outside of Australia and at least 20 leagues that are recognised by the game's governing body, exist outside Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/GameDevelopment/International/tabid/285/Default.aspx AFL International Development] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070305000000/http://www.afl.com.au/GameDevelopment/International/tabid/285/Default.aspx |date=5 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 there was a total of 34,845 players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/2007_International_Census_Sheet_240807.pdf AFL International Census 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524130530/http://www.afl.com.au/Portals/0/afl_docs/2007_International_Census_Sheet_240807.pdf |date=24 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, there are over 800,000 players in Australia where the game is at its strongest; overseas players make up less than 2% of the total players worldwide.

Australian rules football is played professionally by men and women in Australia and is a major spectator sport in Australia and [[Nauru]].

== Players of Australian rules football ==
There have been several [[List of overseas-born AFL players|players in the VFL/AFL who were born outside Australia]] and since 1982, an increasing number of players have been recruited from outside Australia through initiatives such as the [[Irish experiment]] and more recently, international scholarship programs.  Despite the amateur competitions outside of Australia, no player from these competitions has yet debuted in the AFL Premiership Season.  Some have, however, featured in semi-professional competitions in Australia as well as in AFL pre-season practice matches. {{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The international growth of Australian rules in the 19th century and early 20th century was rapid, but it went into rapid decline following World War I.  After World War II, the sport experienced a small amount of growth in the Pacific region, particularly in [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], [[Australian rules football in Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea]] and [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]].

Australian Football emerged as an international sport much later than other forms of football, such as soccer or rugby, but has grown substantially as an amateur sport in some countries since the 1980s.  Initially, the sport grew with the [[Australian diaspora]], [[List of overseas-born AFL players|aided by multiculturalism]] and assisted by [[Australian football exhibition matches|exhibition matches]] and [[Players who have converted from one football code to another|players who have converted to and from other football codes]].  In Papua New Guinea, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United States, there are many thousands of players.  Canada, Japan, Denmark, and Sweden have also shown strong potential in the sport in the lead up to the [[2008 Australian Football International Cup]].

The AFL became the de facto international governing body for the sport when created the ''AFL International Development Committee'' and the IAFC was dissolved between 2002 and 2006.

Australian Football is played professionally by men, in Australia, and is the dominant spectator sport, with the exception of [[Australian rules football exhibition matches|exhibition games]] staged in other countries.

The game is played in many countries, the [[Australian Football League]] and has more than 13 affiliated international governing bodies, [[AFL Canada]], [[Danish Australian Football League]], [[BARFL]], [[AFL Japan]], [[ARFLI]], [[Nauru Australian Football Association]], [[New Zealand AFL]], [[USAFL]], [[AFL South Africa]], [[AFL PNG]], [[AFL Samoa]], [[Tonga Australian Football Association]] and [[AFL Germany]]. The league also has working relationships with bodies in additional countries, who have sent, or may in future send, teams to the International Cup. In 2010, a European association of 18 Countries was founded which later re-branded as [http://www.afleurope.org AFL Europe]. This association is affiliated to the Australian Football League, which funds the retention of a regional manager in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

==History of Australian rules football within Australia==
{{see also|Barassi Line}}
{{see also|History of Australian rules football}}
Australian rules football traditionally has seen its greatest support in [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]], the [[Northern Territory]] and the [[Riverina]] region of [[New South Wales]].

Prior to the establishment of the AFL in 1990, leagues were generally state-specific, with the [[Victorian Football League]] slowly beginning to expand prior to this point.

Since becoming a national league, the AFL has continued its attempt to grow in the rest of Australia, with the success of teams in those areas helping to fuel interest in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Douglass|first1=Mark|title=GWS Giants' AFL success being felt at all levels of Aussie Rules in Western Sydney|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-07-18/giant-tide-rising-in-sydneys-west/8720542|publisher=ABC.au|accessdate=20 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of Australian rules outside Australia==

===Early beginnings===
Almost as soon as the game was becoming established in Australia, it had spread to [[Australian rules football in New Zealand|New Zealand]] and [[Australian rules football in South Africa|South Africa]], initially because of the [[Otago Gold Rush]] and [[Witwatersrand Gold Rush]].  The game was further fuelled in South Africa by Australian soldiers in the [[First Boer War|First]] and [[Second Boer War]]s.

There were reports of early competitions in England, Scotland, and [[Australian rules football in Japan|Japan]], started by expatriate Australians and servicemen.

===The First World Governing Body and international competition===
In New Zealand, where proximity to Australia saw a formidable league, the sport quickly grew to a sizeable 115 clubs by the turn of the 20th century.  As the game spread, it became known as ''Australasian Football'', with delegates from New Zealand added to the newly formed Australasian Football Council.

In 1908, New Zealand defeated both New South Wales and Queensland at the '''Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival''', an event held to celebrate 50 years of Australian Football.

===Decline and hiatus===
World War I saw the game being played by Australian servicemen around the world, particularly in Egypt, and in Europe in France, Belgium, and England.

Following the war, the game went into a sharp decline outside of Australia, with all international domestic competitions dying out. National teams and international competition in the sport became non-existent for three quarters of the 20th century. The return of many Australian expatriates from overseas gold fields and tours of duty, combined with Australia's low profile on the world stage, offered few opportunities for the game to grow during this time. With the withdrawal of its New Zealand delegates, the sport returned to the title of ''Australian Football'', governed by the Australian Football Council. Concerned primarily with the growth of their own domestic competitions, the Australian leagues and governing bodies made little effort to develop or promote the game until the 1950s, and the council's role was mainly to oversee the growing importance of [[Interstate matches in Australian rules football|interstate test matches]].

Nevertheless, the longest running fixture outside of Australia, the annual Varsity match between [[Oxford University Australian Rules Football Club]] and [[Cambridge University]] in England, has been held since 1921, and has emerged into a fierce rivalry, worthy of [[University Sporting Blue|half-blue status]] at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt2005wk7/Sport/triumphant_oxford_are_rucking_great |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820202818/http://www.oxfordstudent.com/mt2005wk7/Sport/triumphant_oxford_are_rucking_great |archivedate=20 August 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Triumphant Oxford are rucking great from oxfordstudent.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from this match, however the game was rarely played in England.

===Return of Oceania football===
[[Image:Linkbelt1999-Finalspiel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Action from an Aussie Rules game in [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]] at the [[Linkbelt Oval]]]]
Australian Football has been continuously played in the former Australian [[League of Nations mandate|trustee mandate]] of [[Australian rules football in Nauru|Nauru]], which began both senior and junior local competitions in the 1930s.  Australian Football was also introduced to the [[Territory of New Guinea]] in 1944 and the [[Territory of Papua]] in 1948.

[[World War II]] saw some servicemen play the game overseas, particularly in Malaysia, Indonesia, Egypt, and Algeria.  During the [[Vietnam War]], matches were even played by servicemen against the local Vietnamese.

In the 1960s, Australian leagues began to show some interest in expansion of the game outside of Australia.  1963 saw the first [[Australian rules football exhibition matches]] played in the United States.  Australian state leagues began occasionally promoting themselves in this way over the following decades.

In 1967, it was reported in the [[VFL/AFL|VFL]] Record's "Footy Facts" column that Australian football clubs existed in [[Johannesburg]], [[Pretoria]], and [[Cape Town]] and that the VFL was optimistic about the future of the game in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;AFL Record.  Round 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of how or when these clubs had formed or what later became of them.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Since 1967, there have been many matches between Australian and Irish teams, under various sets of hybrid, compromise rules. In 1984, the first official representative matches of [[International rules football]] were played, and these games have continued to be played annually each October, now attracting considerable public interest, drawing sizable crowds, and receiving regular television coverage. New Zealand resumed a local competition in 1974.

By 1975, Papua New Guinea had gained independence and test matches began to be played against teams from Australia.  The first ever full international match involving Australia was played in 1977 at under 17 level between Australia and Papua New Guinea in Adelaide, with Australia taking the honours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=1977-1980 | work=Full Points Footy | url=http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/1977_to_1980.htm | accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, Australia have been peerless in the sport and seldom compete at international level.

Despite these advancements and others to the international aspects of the game, progress overseas is rarely covered in the [[Media of Australia|Australian media]].

===1980s and '90s===
In the late 1980s, successful VFL exhibition matches attracted large crowds and spawned fledgling local competitions in both Japan and Canada.  The Australian media showed only a token interest in the matches in London and Japan involving VFL clubs.  It was during this decade that the sport was first televised in North America and the United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Some nationalities respond well to less formal means,{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} however, and many trends in sporting activities are achieved outside formally organized programs.  For instance, although Australian football was not formally established in Tonga until 2003 however informal matches had been introduced to schools as early as 1985.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Game spreads===
The largest barriers to growth of Australian Football internationally have traditionally been distance, field availability, and player numbers.  With a total of 36 players normally required for a game, and a cricket sized oval, organising games can be difficult in countries where space is a premium and devotees are spread widely.  While these factors have not been a problem in Papua New Guinea or New Zealand, they did pose large problems to leagues in Europe, Asia, and the Americas.  This disadvantage has been turned into an advantage with some organisers accepting modified versions of the game, such as [[Variations of Australian rules football#9-a-side|nine-a-side]], requiring fewer players and less space.

In the late 1980s, as organisers adapted, amateur leagues were established in [[Australian rules football in Japan|Japan]] (1987), [[Australian rules football in England|England]], [[Australian rules football in Denmark|Denmark]], and [[Australian rules football in Canada|Canada]] (1989).  In the case of Japan and Canada, these were directly sparked by VFL exhibition matches.

In the 1990s, the Australian diaspora had spread and amateur competition had grown in countries such as [[Australian rules football in Sweden|Sweden]] (1993), [[Australian rules football in Germany|Germany]] (1995), the [[Australian rules football in the United States|USA]] (1996), [[Australian rules football in Argentina|Argentina]], [[Australian rules football in Spain|Spain]],  [[Australian rules football in Samoa|Samoa]] (1997), and [[Australian rules football in South Africa|South Africa]] (1998), as well as a number of mainly expatriate teams, mainly based in [[South East Asia]].

During this time, the VFL expanded to become the AFL and began to command a greater national and international audience.  Word of the sport grew out of AFL exhibition matches, cult television followings, and Internet communication.  [[North America]]n fans formed an organisation, [[AFANA]], specifically to work for improved media coverage of Australian Football.

The traditionalists in the governing bodies of Australia (which became the AFL) were reluctant to sanction any games which were not played exactly according to the Laws of the Game, and the AFL initially did not recognise leagues that played the game on fields that did not closely match the proper dimensions, or had less than 16 players per side. Since the 1990s, these attitudes have changed somewhat, and the AFL and other development bodies have directly contributed to the development of the game overseas.

===Formation of a world governing body===
The [[International Australian Football Council]] (IAFC) was formed after football first featured at the [[Arafura Games]] in 1995. Since 1998, the [[Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament]], endorsed by the AFL as part of its International Policy, has hosted several junior teams from other countries.

Since 2000, fledgling competitions have been established in countries such as [[Australian rules football in Ireland|Ireland]] (2000), [[Australian rules football in Tonga|Tonga]] (2002), [[Australian rules football in Scotland|Scotland]], [[Australian rules football in France|France]], and [[Australian rules football in China|China]] (2005). Television and the internet have since helped to increase the awareness of the game outside of Australia.

Inspired by successful Arafura Games competitions, the inaugural [[Australian Football International Cup]] was held in Melbourne in 2002, an initiative of the IAFC and the AFL.  The first International Cup also marked the beginnings of a very small media interest in the international aspects of the game in Australia.

At the 2002 International Cup, meetings held between the AFL, IAFC, and international teams saw a unanimous vote amongst member countries that the AFL become the ''de facto'' world governing body for the sport, with the leagues linked to the teams affiliating with the AFL.  The IAFC's public relations officer, Brian Clarke, disputed this move and continued the organisation in name.  This organisation was finally dissolved in 2005, dropping all public claims to being the world governing body for the sport and being replaced by the development organisation Aussie Rules International.

===21st century===
In recent years, the game has grown particularly strongly in Papua New Guinea and New Zealand.  In  percentage terms, their increases are high in comparison to the growth of the sport in Australia, and their total player numbers are at least 100,000, making senior competition involving Australia at open level unlikely for some time.

In 2004, a volunteer group known as World Footy News&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com World Footy News]&lt;/ref&gt; began documenting the growth of Australian football internationally through their website, becoming a major source of international football news, and for the first time providing a source of detailed coverage for the International Cups (2005 and 2008).  Its website states that it "was created to foster awareness of Australian Football around the globe and to aid communication between clubs, leagues and individuals playing and supporting Aussie Rules".  At various times between 2004 and 2007, other regularly updated sources included OziRulzGlobal, Fourth Quarter, and with slowly improving quantity, an International Leagues section of the AFL website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au AFL website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, after eight years of growing domestic competition, the South African government declared Australian Football to be the sport for "the new South Africa", injecting government funding into the sport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2005/s1296562.htm South Africa embraces Australian Rules football]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Australian rules football in Pakistan|Pakistan]], [[Australian rules football in Indonesia|Indonesia]], [[Australian rules football in Catalonia|Catalonia]], [[Australian rules football in Croatia|Croatia]], Norway, [[Australian rules football in Bermuda|Bermuda]] and [[Australian rules football in East Timor|East Timor]] joined the list of playing nations.

On 3 July 2006, the AFL announced that it had formed an International Development Committee to support overseas leagues. The AFL hopes to develop the game in other countries to the point where Australian football is played at an international level by top-quality sides from around the world. The AFL plans to host the International Cup regularly every three or four years, beginning in 2008, the 150th anniversary of the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AFL International Development plans | work=World Footy News | url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=2006063006252654 | accessdate=2006-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the AFL's interest in the internationalisation of the game, coverage in the Australian media grew substantially.

On 14 April 2007, the [[Australian Institute of Sport]] Under 17 squad competed against the [[South African national Australian rules football team]] in the first international match between the two countries at [[North West Cricket Stadium]] in [[Potchefstroom]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=20070418011543665 Aussie talent all class on African footy's big day] from worldfootynews.com&lt;/ref&gt; The Australians won  by a score of 162-12.  In the same month, a massive junior program called "FootyWILD", similar to Auskick, was launched in the country.

On 25 April 2013, the first premiership match outside of Australia was held at [[Westpac Stadium]] in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, between the Sydney Swans and the St Kilda Saints, and attracted a crowd of over 22,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/other-sports/8598398/AFL-boys-put-on-show-for-new-Wellington-fans Fairfax NZ News - AFL boys put on show for new Wellington fans]&lt;/ref&gt; In the two subsequent years crowds at this event dwindled, and the matches in New Zealand were scrapped after 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/news/2015-10-27/no-new-zealand-games-in-2016-as-saints-kiwi-push-teeters-on-the-brink&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==International competition==
{{See also|List of International Australian rules football Tournaments}}
The first truly international competitor in Australian Football was New Zealand.  In 1908, the Jubilee Australasian Football Carnival was held to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Australian rules football.  New Zealand (then representing a total of 115 clubs) defeated both New South Wales and Queensland in the carnival, but lost to Victoria and Tasmania.

The 1995 [[Arafura Games]], held in [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], [[Northern Territory]], Australia became the first international sporting event to have Australian football as a competition sport, rather than a [[demonstration sport]]. [[Papua New Guinea]] won the [[gold medal]] and retained it in subsequent games.  Other teams that have competed at Australian Rules in the games include Japan, [[Nauru]], and a Northern Territory indigenous team.  The [[International Australian football Council]] (IAFC) was formed after the 1995 Games.&lt;ref name="Cup"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?page=1&amp;sy=nstore&amp;docID=SAG020811FMO5D5J30JN|title=World Game Steps Up To The Mark|first=Peter |last=Hanlon|date=11 August 2002|work=The Sunday Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by successful Arafura Games competitions, the inaugural [[Australian Football International Cup]] was [[2002 Australian Football International Cup|held in Melbourne in 2002]], as the last act of the IAFC, and held in conjunction with the AFL. The 2002 cup was contested by eleven teams from around the world, made up exclusively of non-Australians.&lt;ref name="Cup"/&gt;  Ireland won, defeating [[Papua New Guinea]] in the final.

In the interim years, Japan and New Zealand played an annual game as a curtain raiser to the AFL games. The New Zealand national team were victorious by 100 points in 2003, and so, in 2004, a club side from [[Auckland]] played the game, which Japan lost by two points.  The amateur [[Australian Convicts]] also toured, playing several matches against sides from developing nations.

The second Australian Football International Cup [[2005 Australian Football International Cup|was held in Melbourne in 2005]], again under the guidance and funding of the AFL, with New Zealand defeating [[Papua New Guinea]] in the final. Third place went to the [[United States of America]].

In 2001 The United States, Great Britain, Denmark and Ireland competed in the Atalantic Alliance Cup. This was fore runner to other European competitions starting with the EU Cup which became the Euro Cup and also the Central European Australian Football league Championships .

In 2006, Denmark, Sweden and Germany competed in a tri-nations series, which was planned to be repeated annually.

The third [[2008 Australian Football International Cup|Australian Football International Cup]] was held in 2008 by the AFL in Melbourne, with a record 16 teams competing. Papua New Guinea won their first title, defeating New Zealand, and South Africa controversially defeated Ireland by 1 point to finish third.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php/20080906151723980 Controversial finish as South Africa defeat Ireland after the siren]&lt;/ref&gt;

The fourth [[2011 Australian Football International Cup|Australian Football International Cup]] was held in 2011 by the AFL in Melbourne and Sydney, with a record 18 teams competing. Ireland won their second title by defeating Papua New Guinea who have appeared in every AFL International Cup grand final.

Other international competitions that included some  Australian expatriates are also held, including the [[EU Cup]], which [[2005 EU Cup Australian rules football|was first held in 2005 in London]], featuring ten teams. In 2007 the Cup [[2007 EU Cup Australian rules football|was held in Hamburg]], with twelve teams.

In 2013 the East Asia Australian Football League was formed  with Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Jakarta and Laos competing. 
Also the South China Australian Football League consists of three teams from Hong Kong, Macau, Landau and Gangzhou.

===World rankings===
{{main article|Australian Football International Cup#Overall tournament results}}

Although the AFL is regarded as the world governing body, it does not publish statistics for matches that it does not specifically sanction. By 2009, the only attempt to consolidate all world rankings was created by the [http://www.worldfootynews.com World Footy News website], which for 2008 listed 22 countries, from Australia (1st) through to India (22nd). Detailed criteria were given as to whether a country qualified for consideration, though ultimately the rankings were listed as unofficial, and are only noteworthy because of the lack of any other system. [http://www.worldfootynews.com/staticpages/index.php/World_Rankings_2008 The unofficial 2008 Australian Football World Rankings].

=== International rules Australia vs Ireland ===

A series of hybrid [[International rules]] matches between the [[Australian Football League]]'s best professional players and a representative [[Gaelic football]] team from Ireland's [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] amateur players is staged annually.  The rules are a compromise between the two codes, using a round ball and a rectangular field.  The fierce [[tackle (football move)|tackling]] of the Australian code is allowed, although this has caused controversy with the Irish players. The series have remained evenly matched with the Irish using speed and athleticism, and the Australians strength and power — both inherent skills in their respective codes.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

== International promotion, funding &amp; governance ==
The [[International Australian football Council]] (IAFC) was formed in 1995 by a subset of playing countries to promote and develop Australian football internationally, before unanimously dissolving in favour of the AFL in 2002.

Australian football is not yet considered large enough internationally for a [[FIFA]] style governing body, so the [[Australian Football League]] is primarily responsible for funding and governance.  In the mid-2000s, it provided around $30 million for development of the game in Australia and around [[Australian dollar|A$]]500,000 annually for international development, with the following breakdown in 2005:

*New Zealand $150,000
*South Africa $100,000
*United States of America $90,000
*Papua New Guinea $45,000
*Other $115,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realfooty.theage.com.au/realfooty/articles/2005/08/13/1123353542237.html Union in Aussie rules] by Caroline Wilson from the Age 14 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Including AFL exhibition and NAB Cup matches, indigenous and AIS youth tours, International Cup funding and staff funding, this will have risen to around [[Australian dollar|A$]]2,000,000 annually by 2008.  Additional support for countries such as South Africa is leveraged through contacts with industry, and is increasingly adding to the total investment.

Much of the additional international promotion of the game is fuelled by exhibition matches, expatriate Australians, local leagues, and various [[AusAID]] projects.  The internet is seen as a key tool in keeping diverse Australian football communities in contact.

===High profile advocates===
Although international football has a low profile within Australia, the issue is getting increased media exposure as several high-profile Australians have become advocates for international football.  Former players and coaches that are involved in, have expressed interest in or are passionate about international footy at some stage include [[Ron Barassi]], [[Kevin Sheedy (Australian footballer)|Kevin Sheedy]], [[Jim Stynes]], [[Paul Roos (footballer)|Paul Roos]], [[Robert DiPierdomenico]], [[Michael Long (footballer)|Michael Long]], [[Garry Lyon]], [[Peter Schwab]], [[Guy McKenna]], [[Glenn Archer]], [[Jason McCartney (footballer)|Jason McCartney]], [[Wayne Schwass]], and [[Mal Michael]].  Current players who have expressed views or interest on the topic include [[David Rodan]], [[Alipate Carlile]], [[Jimmy Bartel]], [[Jason Akermanis]], [[Aaron Edwards]], and [[Brad Moran (footballer)|Brad Moran]].  Former AFL players [[Mark Zanotti]] and [[John Ironmonger]] have been directly involved in living and establishing clubs overseas. Other non-players such as [[John So]], [[Eddie McGuire]], and [[Tiffany Cherry]] have also expressed interest in the media about the game being played or watched overseas.

==Women's competitions==
[[Image:Women's marking contest mark.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Women's Australian rules football]]
Australia has had many women's leagues at both state and local level for decades. The first semi-professional women's Australian football league, the [[AFL Women's|AFLW]] was founded in late 2016, after the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] had conducted [[AFL Women's#Women's exhibition games (2013–2016)|several exhibition matches]] over the previous few years. The inaugural season, held in [[2017 AFL Women's season|2017]] was considered a huge success by the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] and the league intends to expand from eight teams to 14 by the 2020 season.

Internationally, women's Australian football is played at amateur level in several countries, particularly in the United Kingdom, North America and parts of Europe and Asia. and a dozen teams have represented their nations at one or more [[Australian Football International Cup]] since [[2011 Australian Football International Cup#Women's Fixtures|2011]]. Ireland and Canada have dominated thus far, being the only teams to contest the women's grand final in the competition. Ireland's team, nicknamed the Banshees, are the most recent winners, defeating Canada by just four points in the grand final of the [[2017 Australian Football International Cup#Women's Tournament|2017 tournament]].

== Junior competitions==
Several countries now have youth Australian rules programs in place. These countries include [[Papua New Guinea]], New Zealand, [[Samoa]], [[Tonga]], [[Nauru]], Denmark, [[South Africa]], England, [[Indonesia]], the United States, and Canada. The number of participants is quite high in PNG, RSA and NZ generally dependent on the level of AFL funding but some "private" endeavours in Canada and the UK have produced significant results.

Since 1998, the [[Barassi International Australian Football Youth Tournament]], endorsed by the Australian Football League as part of its International Policy, has hosted several of these nation's representative youth teams.

The first fully representative junior international Australian football outside of Australia was played between England and Denmark in Farum, Denmark, in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AFL Roller Coaster Ride for Danes on the International Front | work=World Footy News | url=http://www.worldfootynews.com/article.php?story=20060919061738283 | accessdate=2006-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jakarta Bulldogs Australian Football Club,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australianrulesfootball.com.au/pages/aflindonesiaas#JAKARTA%20BULLDOGS]&lt;/ref&gt; founded in 2006 by Alf Eddy, was an Australian Football Club made up of Under 18-year-old expatriate and local students in Jakarta. The team played against local teams such as the Pancawati Eagles, Depok Garudas, and the Jakarta Bintangs, and also travelled to Singapore and Malaysia in 2008 and 2009, respectively, for the Asian Australian Football Championships. The Bulldogs won the competition in both years.
Currently there is an increasing number of junior international Australian Football notably, North America, Scandinavia and the Pacific.

==Specific development projects==

===South African AusAID project===
An [[AusAID]] funded project is South African junior development began in 2003, which is assisted by aid agency [[Australian Volunteers International]] in partnership with programs such as AFL [[Auskick]], and sponsored by [[Tattersalls (gambling organisation)|Tattersalls]] as well as the South African North West Academy of Sport.

====Aussie Rules Schools (England)====
Another funded junior project is Aussie Rules Schools UK, which is funded by [[Sport England]] and co-ordinated by AFL England and AFL Europe.  This project has seen up to ten English schools adopt Aussie Rules as part of the school curriculum to combat obesity.

====China AusAID project====
In February 2006, a joint project between the AFL, [[Melbourne Football Club]], [[Melbourne City Council]], and AusAID to post an Australian Youth Ambassador in [[Tianjin]], a city of 10 million, about {{convert|120|km}} southeast of [[Beijing]] in an effort to kickstart Australian Football in China was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldsun.news.com.au/footy/common/story_page/0,8033,18039362%5E20322,00.html Melbourne's China experiment a reality] by Brett Northey for World Footy News. 18 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacific AusAID projects====
There have been full-time development officers in [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]], as part of [[AusAid]] projects, since 2005.

==International drafts and converts==

===International players===
[[Michito Sakaki]] from Japan became the first international player to play at AFL level when selected to play for the [[Essendon Football Club]] against the [[Sydney Swans]] at an exhibition match at [[North Sydney Oval]] in February 2006. [[Mike Pyke]], a former Canadian rugby player, was drafted to the [[Sydney Swans]] in 2009, and played his first game in Round 7 of 2009 against Geelong, becoming the first non-Irish international player to play an official league game.

===Converts===
{{See also|List of Football Code Converts}}

====Gaelic converts to Australian football====
Australia has recruited several Irish Gaelic footballers to play Aussie Rules.  As Gaelic football is primarily an amateur competition and the AFL competition is professional, there is a strong financial lure.  In the 1980s, the [[Melbourne Football Club]] recruited [[Jim Stynes]], who would turn out to be the most successful Irish player in the history of the VFL/AFL, winning the [[Brownlow medal]].  At around the same time, the club recruited the Scot [[Sean Wight]].  In more recent years, the [[Sydney Swans]] recruited Irishman [[Tadhg Kennelly]], who played in a premiership with the club and has also represented Ireland against Australia.  [[Carlton Football Club]] experimented with brothers [[Setanta Ó hAilpín]] and [[Aisake Ó hAilpín]].  The [[Collingwood Football Club]] has recruited Martin Clarke, and the [[Brisbane Lions]] recruited [[Colm Begley]] and [[Brendan Quigley]] to their international rookie list.  Due to increasing concern from the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], in 2006 the AFL made a deal with the GAA to limit the number of junior Gaelic drafts.

====Australian football converts to American football (Gridiron)====
{{See also|Australian sportsmen linked to professional American Football}}
Australia has exported players to the [[NFL]].  Since the 1980s, many AFL players have tried out as American football [[Punter (football)|punters]]. The [[Special teams#Special teams|special teams]] position requires the long range kicking skills often used by Australian football players, particularly those playing [[centre half-forward]] and [[full-forward]].  Although the punter position is one of the least valuable on an NFL team, punters and kickers have an average salary of around US$860,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0807/nfl.average.salaries.by.position/content.10.html NFL's Average Salaries By Position: Punter/Kicker $868,005], ''Sports Illustrated''&lt;/ref&gt; which surpasses the wages of AFL players, who average A$221,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=90746 Average player salary tops $221,000], ''AFL.com'', 19 March 2010. Retrieved 21 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As the position is less physically demanding, it has also become attractive for players heading into retirement.

The '''Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict''' is the first [[international treaty]] that focuses exclusively on the protection of [[cultural property]] in armed conflict. It was signed at [[The Hague]], [[Netherlands]] on 14 May 1954 and entered into force on 7 August 1956. As of September 2018, it has been ratified by 133 states.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

The provisions of the 1954 Convention were supplemented and clarified by two protocols concluded in 1954 and 1999. All three agreements are part of International Humanitarian Law, which, in the form of further agreements, primarily includes provisions defining the permissible means and methods of warfare and aiming at the widest possible protection of persons not involved in the fighting. In contrast to these parts of International Humanitarian Law, the agreements on the protection of cultural property were drawn up under the auspices of the United Nations (UN); the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) is primarily responsible for the dissemination and monitoring of compliance. In addition to rules designed to ensure the protection and respect of cultural property during an armed conflict, these agreements also provide for security measures to be implemented in times of peace. As of June 2018, 132 states are party to the Hague Convention of 1954, 109 and 77 states respectively have acceded to the Protocols of 1954 and 1999. Blue Shield International, based in The Hague, is active in the field of international coordination with regard to military and civil structures for the protection of cultural assets.

The guiding principles of the Convention and the motivation for its conclusion, dissemination and respect are summarised in the preamble, which states, among other things,

"... that any damage to cultural property, irrespective of the people it belongs to, is a damage to the cultural heritage    of all humanity, because every people contributes to the world's culture..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1954-hague-convention/text/|title=Text  {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural property==
For the purposes of the present Convention, the term 'cultural property' shall cover, irrespective of origin or ownership:

(a) movable or immovable property of great importance to the cultural heritage of every people, such as monuments of architecture, art or history, whether religious or secular; archaeological sites; groups of buildings which, as a whole, are of historical or artistic interest; works of art; manuscripts, books and other objects of artistic, historical or archaeological interest; as well as scientific collections and important collections of books or archives or of reproductions of the property defined above;

(b) buildings whose main and effective purpose is to preserve or exhibit the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a) such as museums, large libraries and depositories of archives, and refuges intended to shelter, in the event of armed conflict, the movable cultural property defined in sub-paragraph (a);

(c) centers containing a large amount of cultural property as defined in sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), to be known as 'centers containing monuments'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2018-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural property]] is the manifestation and expression of the cultural heritage of a group of people or a society. It is an expression of the ways of living developed by a community and passed on from generation to generation, including the customs of a people, their practices, places, objects, artistic endeavours and values. The protection of cultural property during times of armed conflict or occupation is of great importance, because such property reflects the life, history and identity of communities; its preservation helps to rebuild communities, re-establish identities, and link people's past with their present and future.

== History ==
The [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] preceded the Hague Convention of 1954.&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The laws of armed conflicts : a collection of conventions, resolutions, and other documents |date=1988 |publisher=Nijhoff |last=Schindler |first=Dietrich |last2=Toman |first2=Jiří |isbn=9024733065 |edition=3rd |location=Dordrecht |oclc=13270517}}&lt;/ref&gt; The multilateral agreement of 1899 and the slightly amended later version of 1907 contained in Article 27 the commandment for the attacking party to spare historical monuments, educational institutions and institutions of religious, not-for-profit, artistic or scientific significance as far as possible during sieges and bombardments. The party under attacked is called upon to ark appropriate buildings. Article 56 also contained a general ban on the confiscation, destruction or damage of such facilities. However, during the [[First World War]], acceptance of these first Hague Conventions was severely restricted by the so-called all-participation clause. It stated that, in the event of war or armed conflict, this Agreement should apply only if all States involved in that conflict are parties to the Convention.

The Russian lawyer, painter and writer [[Nicholas Roerich]], who witnessed the destruction of cultural assets in Russia during the First World War and the [[October Revolution]], initiated the development of an independent treaty at the beginning of the 1930s to protect cultural assets during armed conflicts. Ten years later, just before the beginning of the First World War, he had also addressed his idea to the Russian Tsar Nicholas II. On his initiative, Georges Chklaver of the Institute for Higher International Studies at the University of Paris drew up a corresponding draft in 1929. This proposal was subsequently discussed by the International Museum Office of the [[League of Nations]] and at private conferences in Bruges in 1931 and 1932 and in Washington, D.C. in 1933. The seventh international conference of American states, which took place in Buenos Aires in 1933, recommended the adoption of the draft. The Board of the Pan-American Union subsequently presented a treaty "on the protection of artistic and scientific institutions and historical monuments", which was signed on 15 April 1935 in the White House by 21 states in North, Central and South America.&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"/&gt; Ten of the signatory states also became parties by ratification, the first of which was the United States on 13 July 1935 and the last of which was Colombia on 20 February 1937. The agreement, also known as the [[Roerich Pact]] after its initiator, entered into force on 26 August 1935.

The Roerich Pact contained eight articles and several significant innovations compared with the general provisions of Articles 27 and 56 of the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907. On the one hand, the treaty established the status of neutrality for historical monuments, museums, scientific and artistic institutions as well as educational and cultural institutions. This legal position, comparable to the neutrality of medical personnel and comparable institutions during a war, resulted in respect for these goods by all parties involved in a conflict and thus their protection. The Parties should send lists of monuments and sites for which they claimed protection under the Treaty to the Pan-American Union, which should forward them to all States Parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Roerich Pact|date=2018-05-08|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Roerich_Pact&amp;oldid=840203974|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|language=en|accessdate=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Banner of Peace from the Roerich Pact.svg|thumb|120x120px|The Banner of Peace- The Emblem of Protection of the Roerich Pact]]
In addition, the Treaty defined a protection mark for the marking of cultural objects, consisting of three red dots in a red circle on a white background. Nicholas Roerich, who designed it with early symbolism in mind, described the significance of the three points as a symbol of art, science and religion as the three most important cultural activities of humanity, with the circle as the element that linked these three aspects in the past, present and future. The symbol was also called the "Banner of Peace", the movement based on the Roerich Pact under the name Pax Cultura in analogy to the [[Geneva Conventions]] as the "Red Cross of Culture".

However, the acceptance of the Roerich Pact was limited to the United States and the countries of Central and South America. Not a single country in Europe and Asia, the geopolitical focus of the Second World War that began a few years later, signed or ratified the treaty. Even though it remains valid in relations between the parties and the Organization of American States (OAS) and continues to act as a depositary in succession to the Pan-American Union, the Roerich Pact remained without significant practical relevance. As the USA is not party to the 1999 Second Protocol of the Hague Convention, the Roerich Pact is therefore still of importance as a contractual obligation in the area of cultural property protection. Nevertheless, with the establishment of a protective label and the administration of lists of cultural assets worthy of protection by a central international institution, this treaty introduced two important far-reaching principles in the area of the protection of cultural assets in armed conflicts that remain important today.

Only four years after the Roerich Pact was signed, the government of the Netherlands presented a draft for a new convention, in the drafting of which the International Museum Office of the League of Nations was also significantly involved. However, the start of the [[Second World War]] in the same year prevented all further steps to develop and implement this proposal. After the end of the war, in 1948 the Netherlands again submitted a proposal to UNESCO, which had been founded three years earlier. In 1951, the General Conference of UNESCO decided to set up a committee of governmental experts to draft a new convention. A year later, this committee submitted a draft to the General Conference, which forwarded it to the national governments for further discussion. From 21 April to 14 May 1954, an international conference was held in The Hague with the participation of 56 states, which drew up a final version and adopted it as the "Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict".&lt;ref name="Nijhoff"/&gt; The agreement entered into force on 7 August 1956. After the 1948 [[Genocide Convention]] on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, this was the second important agreement in the field of international humanitarian law to which the United Nations played a major role in its creation and implementation.

== The Hague Convention==
The Hague Convention outlines various prohibitions and obligations which States Parties are expected to observe, both in peacetime and in times of conflict.

Broadly, the Hague Convention requires that States Parties adopt protection measures during peacetime for the safeguarding of cultural property. Such measures include the preparation of inventories, preparation for the removal of movable cultural property and the designation of competent authorities responsible for the safeguarding of cultural property.

States Parties undertake to respect cultural property, not only located within their own territory, but also within the territory of other States Parties, during times of conflict and occupation. In doing so, they agree to refrain from using cultural property and its immediate surroundings for purposes likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict. States Parties also agree to refrain from any act of hostility directed against such property.

The Convention also requires the establishment of special units within national military forces, to be charged with responsibility for the protection of cultural property. Furthermore, States Parties are required to implement criminal sanctions for breaches of the Convention, and to undertake promotion of the Convention to the general public, cultural heritage professionals, the military and law-enforcement agencies.

An example of the successful implementation of the Hague Convention was the Gulf War, in which many members of the coalition forces (who were either party to the Convention or who, in the instance of the US, were not party to the Convention) accepted the Convention's rules, most notably by creating a "no-fire target list" of places where cultural property was known to exist.

===Safeguarding cultural property===
The obligation of States Parties to safeguard cultural property in peacetime is outlined in Article 3. It stipulates:

'The High Contracting Parties undertake to prepare in time of peace for the safeguarding of cultural property situated within their own territory against the foreseeable effects of an armed conflict, by taking such measures, as they consider appropriate.'&lt;ref name="portal.unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Respect for cultural property===
The Hague Convention sets out a minimum level of respect which all States Parties must observe, both in relation to their own national heritage as well as the heritage of other States Parties. States are obliged not to attack cultural property, nor to remove or misappropriate movable property from its territory of origin. Only exceptional cases of 'military necessity' will excuse derogation from this obligation. However, a State Party is not entitled to ignore the Convention's rules by reason of another Party's failure to implement safeguarding measures alone.

This is set out in Article 4 of the Hague Convention:

'Article 4:

(1) The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect cultural property situated within their own territory as well as within the territory of other High Contracting Parties by refraining from any use of the property and its immediate surroundings or of the appliances in use for its protection for purposes which are likely to expose it to destruction or damage in the event of armed conflict; and by refraining from any act of hostility directed against such property.

(2) The obligations mentioned in paragraph I of the present Article may be waived only in cases where military necessity imperatively requires such a waiver.

(3) The High Contracting Parties further undertake to prohibit, prevent and, if necessary, put a stop to any form of theft, pillage or misappropriation of, and any acts of vandalism directed against, cultural property. They shall, refrain from requisitioning movable cultural property situated in the territory of another High Contracting Party.

(4) They shall refrain from any act directed by way of reprisals against cultural property.

(5) No High Contracting Party may evade the obligations incumbent upon it under the present Article, in respect of another High Contracting Party, by reason of the fact that the latter has not applied the measures of safeguard referred to in Article 3.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=13637&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupation===
The rules set out in the Hague Convention also apply to States who are Occupying Powers of territory during conflict or otherwise. The Convention obliges Occupying Powers to respect the cultural property of the occupied territory, and to support local national authorities in its preservation and repair when necessary. This obligation is articulated in Article 5:

'Article 5:

(1) Any High Contracting Party in occupation of the whole or part of the territory of another High Contracting Party shall as far as possible support the competent national authorities of the occupied country in safeguarding and preserving its cultural property.

(2) Should it prove necessary to take measures to preserve cultural property situated in occupied territory and damaged by military operations, and should the competent national authorities be unable to take such measures, the Occupying Power shall, as far as possible, and in close co-operation with such authorities, take the most necessary measures of preservation.

(3) Any High Contracting Party whose government is considered their legitimate government by members of a resistance movement, shall, if possible, draw their attention to the obligation to comply with those provisions of the Conventions dealing with respect for cultural property.'&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Special protection ===
The Hague Convention establishes a 'special protection' regime, which obliges States Parties to ensure the immunity of cultural property under special protection from acts of hostility (Articles 8 and 9).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Under Article 8, this protection may be granted to one of three categories of cultural property: (1) refuges intended to shelter movable cultural property in the event of armed conflict; (2) centers containing monuments; and (3) other immovable cultural property of very great importance. To receive special protection, cultural property must also be located an adequate distance from an industrial center or location which would render it vulnerable to attack, and must not be used for military purposes.

== First Protocol to the Hague Convention ==
The First Protocol was adopted at the same time as the Hague Convention, on 14 May 1954. It specifically applies to movable cultural property only, and prohibits the export of movable property from occupied territory and also requires its return to its original territory at the conclusion of hostilities (Article 1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15391&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html#STATE_PARTIES|title=Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; States Parties under the obligation to prevent the export of such property may be required to pay an indemnity to States whose property was removed during hostilities.

==Second Protocol to the Hague Convention==
{{anchor|Second Protocol to the Hague Convention}}
Criminal acts committed against cultural property in the late 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s highlighted the deficiencies in the implementation of the Hague Convention and its First Protocol. As a result of the 'Boylan review' (a review of the Convention led by Professor Patrick Boylan),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0010/001001/100159eo.pdf|title=Review of the Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in Armed Conflict|last=Boylan|first=Patrick J.|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention was adopted at a Diplomatic Conference held at The Hague in March 1999. The Second Protocol seeks complement and expand upon the provisions of the Hague Convention, by including developments in international humanitarian law and cultural property protection which had emerged since 1954. It builds on the provisions contained in the Convention relating to the safeguarding of and respect for cultural property, as well as the conduct of hostilities; thereby providing greater protection for cultural property than that conferred by the Hague Convention and its First Protocol.

===Enhanced protection===
[[File:Azerbaijan Gobustan site - EP sign.jpg|thumb|The enhanced protection emblem displayed at the Gobustan Archaeological site in Azerbaijan.]]
One of the most important features of the Second Protocol is the 'enhanced protection' regime it establishes. This new category of cultural property is outlined in Chapter Three of the Second Protocol. Enhanced protection status means that the relevant cultural property must remain immune from military attack, once it is inscribed on the List of Cultural Property Under Enhanced Protection.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/enhanced-protection/|title=Enhanced Protection {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the 1954 Hague Convention requires States not to make any cultural property the object of attack except for cases of 'military necessity', the Second Protocol stipulates that cultural property under enhanced protection must not be made a military target, even if it has (by its use) become a 'military objective'. An attack against cultural property which enjoys enhanced protection status is only excusable if such an attack is the 'only feasible means of terminating the use of property [in that way]' (Article 13).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To be granted enhanced protection, the cultural property in question must satisfy the three criteria stipulated in Article 10 of the Second Protocol. The three conditions are:

(a) it  is cultural heritage of the greatest importance for humanity;

(b) it is protected by adequate domestic legal and administrative measures recognising its exceptional cultural and historic value and ensuring the highest level of protection; and

(c) it is not used for military purposes or to shield military sites and a declaration has been made by the Party which has control over the cultural property, confirming that it will not be so used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently there are 13 cultural properties from 8 States Parties inscribed on the Enhanced Protection List. These include sites in Azerbaijan, Belgium, Cambodia, Cyprus, Georgia, Italy, Lithuania, and Mali.&lt;ref name="unesco.org"/&gt;

===The Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict===
Article 24 of the Second Protocol establishes a 12-member Committee for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its members are elected for a term of four years, and an equitable geographic representation is taken into account at the election of its members. The Committee meets once a year in ordinary session, and in extraordinary sessions if and when it deems necessary.

The Committee is responsible for the granting, suspension and cancellation of enhanced protection to cultural properties nominated by States Parties. It also receives and considers requests for international assistance which are submitted by States, as well as determining the use of the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Under Article 27 of the Second Protocol, the Committee also has a mandate to develop Guidelines for the implementation of the Second Protocol.

===The Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict===
Article 29 of the Second Protocol establishes the Fund for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict. Its purpose is to provide financial or other assistance for 'preparatory or other measures to be taken in peacetime'. It also provides financial or other assistance in relation to 'emergency, provisional or other measures to protect cultural property during periods of armed conflict', or for recovery at the end of hostilities. The Fund consists of voluntary contributions from States Parties to the Second Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/fund/|title=Fund {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the sums of US $50,000 and US $40,000 were provided to Libya and Mali respectively from the Fund, in response to their requests for assistance in the installation of emergency and safeguarding measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/protection/protection-of-cultural-heritage-in-armed-conflict/international-assistance/|title=International Assistance {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanctions and individual criminal responsibility===
Chapter Four of the Second Protocol specifies sanctions to be imposed for serious violations against cultural property, and defines the conditions in which individual criminal responsibility should apply. This reflects an increased effort to fight impunity through effective criminal prosecution since the adoption of the Hague Convention in 1954. The Second Protocol defines five 'serious violations' for which it establishes individual criminal responsibility (Article 15):&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15207&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Second Protocol to the Hague Convention of 1954 for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict|website=portal.unesco.org|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# making cultural property under enhanced protection the object of attack; 
# using cultural property under enhanced protection or its immediate surroundings in support of military action; 
# extensive destruction or appropriation of cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol; 
# making cultural property protected under the Convention and this Protocol the object of attack; and
# theft, pillage or misappropriation of, or acts of vandalism directed against cultural property protected under the Convention.
States are obligated to adopt appropriate legislation to make these violations criminal offences under their domestic legislation, to stipulate appropriate penalties for these offences, and to establish jurisdiction over these offences (including universal jurisdiction for three of the five serious violations, as set out in Article 16(1)(c)).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icrc.org/ihl/INTRO/590&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of prosecution for crimes against cultural property is ''The Prosecutor v Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi'' case, handed down by the International Criminal Court on 27 September 2016. Al Mahdi was charged with and pleaded guilty to the war crime of intentionally directing attacks against historic monuments and buildings dedicated to religion, and sentenced to nine years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf|title=Case Information Sheet: The Prosecutor v Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi|last=International Criminal Court|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803043957/https://www.icc-cpi.int/mali/al-mahdi/Documents/AlMahdiEng.pdf|archive-date=3 August 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Mahdi was a member of the Ansar Eddine group (a group associated with Al Qaeda), and a co-perpetrator of damaging and destroying nine mausoleums and one mosque in Timbuktu, Mali, in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Military Manual ===
[[File:Military manual.jpg|thumb|150x150px|Military Manual on the Protection of Cultural Property]]
In 2016 UNESCO, in collaboration with the Sanremo International Institute of Humanitarian Law, published a manual titled 'Protection of Cultural Property: Military Manual'. This manual outlines the rules and obligations contained in the Second Protocol, and provides practical guidance on how these rules should be implemented by military forces around the world. It also contains suggestions as to best military practices in relation to these obligations. It relates only to the international laws governing armed conflict, and does not discuss military assistance that is provided in connection with other circumstances such as natural disasters.

==Destruction of cultural property in World War II==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===The Nazis and "degenerate art"===
[[File:Jean Metzinger, 1913, Le Canot, En Canot, Femme au Canot et a l'Ombrelle, Im Boot, approximate dimensions 150 x 116.5 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Metzinger]]'s ''[[En Canot|En Canot (Im Boot)]]'' was one of many works classified as [[degenerate art]] and confiscated by the Nazis.]]The Nazi Party headed by [[Adolf Hitler]] rose to power in Germany in 1933 after the country's crippling defeat, and its socioeconomic distress during the years following [[World War I]]. [[World War II]] was aimed at reclaiming the glory of the once great Germanic state. Cultural property of many European nations and significant ethnic and social groups within them fell victim to Nazi Germany. The Nazi party, through the [[Third Reich]], confiscated close to 20% of all Western European art during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.archives.gov/research/holocaust/records-and-research/documenting-nazi-plunder-of-european-art.html|title=Documenting Nazi Plunder of European Art|date=2016-08-15|work=National Archives|access-date=2018-06-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Nazi party had looted and collected thousands of objects, art works and artefacts from occupied nations, destroyed many, or stored them in secret.

With artists depicting the hardship of the German people after World War I, and further expressing the fear of anti-Semitism and fascism, the Nazi party and Hitler himself soon realised the dangerous power of art, and began to clamp down on artistic production and forcing both artists and the public alike to adhere to a Nazi-approved style.&lt;ref name="Alter-Müri 2004 15–20"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alter-Müri|first=Simone|date=2004|title=Teaching about War and Political Art in the New Millennium|jstor=3194079|journal=Art Education|volume=57|issue=1|pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inherent within the Nazi's ideology was the idea of supremacy of the [[Aryan race|Aryan Race]] and all that it produced; as such the Nazi campaign's aims were to neutralize non-Germanic cultures and this was done through the destruction of culturally significant art and artefacts. This is illustrated greatest in the Jewish communities throughout Europe; by devising a series of laws that allowed them to justify and regulate the legal confiscation of cultural and personal property. Within Germany the looting of German Jewish cultural property began with the confiscation of non-Germanic artwork in the German state collection. Further, artists that were Jewish and artworks that did not match the Nazi ideology, or posed a threat to it, were stamped as [[degenerate art]]. Degenerate works of art, culminating in the infamous exhibition with the same name, were those whose subject, artist, or art was either Jewish or expressed Anti-Nazi sentiments, and was as such offensive to the Third Reich.&lt;ref name="Alter-Müri 2004 15–20"/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, Bücherverbrennung.jpg|default px|thumbnail|right|[[Nazi book burnings]].]]

Jewish collections were looted the most throughout the war. German Jews were ordered to report their personal assets, which were then privatized by the country. Jewish owned art galleries were forced to sell the works of art they housed. The Nazis concentrated their efforts on ensuring that all art within Germany would be Aryan in nature, speaking to the might of the Germanic state rather than Jewish art which was deemed as a blight on society. In a feat to "purge" German museums and collections, confiscation committees seized approximately 16,000 items within Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780198604761.001.0001/acref-9780198604761-e-1002|title=Degenerate art - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780198604761.001.0001/acref-9780198604761-e-1002|access-date=2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining unexploited art was destroyed in massive bonfires. As the war progressed, the Nazi party elite ordered the confiscation of cultural property throughout various European countries.

===Nazi plunder in Eastern Europe===
[[File:Amber Room-1.jpg|thumbnail|Modern Day Amber Room]]
In the [[Soviet Union]], Nazi plunder of cultural significant art is best illustrated in the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich's]] pillage of the [[Catherine Palace]] near [[St Petersburg]] and its famous [[Amber Room]] dating to the early 1700s. In October 1941, the Nazis had occupied the western portion of the Soviet Union, and began removing art treasures to the west. The entirety of the [[Amber Room]] was removed to [[Königsberg]] and reconstructed there. In January 1945, with the Russian army advancing on the city, the Amber Room was ordered to be moved again but its fate is thereafter unclear. A post-war Russian report concluded that 'summarizing all the facts, we can say that the Amber Room was destroyed between 9 and 11 April 1945' during the battle to take the city. However, in the absence of definitive proof, other theories about its fate continue to be entertained to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/a-brief-history-of-the-amber-room-160940121/|title=A Brief History of the Amber Room|work=Smithsonian|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With financial assistance from German donors, Russian craftsmen reconstructed a new Amber Room during the 1990s. The new room was dedicated by Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] at the 300th anniversary of the city of Saint Petersburg.

==After World War II==
With the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]] and the subsequent defeat of the [[Axis Powers]], the atrocities which the Nazi leadership condoned, leading to the removal of culturally significant items and the destruction of numerous others could not be allowed to occur in future generations. This led the victorious [[Allied forces (World War II)|Allied forces]] to create provisions to ensure safeguards for culturally significant items in times of war. As a result, following the signature of the [[Roerich Pact]] by the American States in 1935, attempts were undertaken to draft a more comprehensive convention for the protection of monuments and works of art in time of war. In 1939, a draft convention, elaborated under the auspices of the International Museums Office, was presented to governments by the Netherlands. Due to the onset of the Second World War the draft convention was shelved with no further steps being taken. With the conclusion of the war, a new proposal was submitted to [[UNESCO]] by the Netherlands in 1948. The General Conference of [[UNESCO]] in 1951 decided to convene a committee of government experts to draft a convention. This committee met in 1952 and thereafter submitted its drafts to the General Conference. The intergovernmental Conference, which drew up and adopted the Convention and the further Acts, took place at The Hague from 21 April to 14 May 1954 where 56 States were represented. Following this international agreement The Hague Convention For the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict would come into force in 1956 in order to be an instrument of non derogation for the states bound by the document to stop the looting and destruction of cultural property.

==Implementation of the Convention==

=== Punishment for infringements ===
The [[Rome Statute]], adopted in July 1998 and entering into force four years later, as the legal basis of the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), defines in Article 8(2) deliberate attacks against buildings of a religious, educational, artistic, scientific or non-profit nature and against historical monuments as [[war crimes]] in both international and non-international armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/ihl|title=Treaties, States parties, and Commentaries - By topic|website=ihl-databases.icrc.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Criminal Court is thus authorised to prosecute such crimes if such an act was committed either by a national of a Contracting Party or on the territory of a Contracting Party. However, it only exercises its competence if the country concerned is unwilling or unable to ensure effective prosecution itself. Since September 2015, Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mahdi has been charged with the destruction of mausoleums in Timbuktu in the first trial before the ICC over the destruction of cultural assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icc-cpi.int/iccdocs/PIDS/publications/AlMahdiEng.pdf|title=Situation in the Republic of Mali, The Prosecutor v.

=== Siege of Dubrovnik and the Mostar Bridge ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2017}}
[[File:Aerial view Dubrovnik Old City.jpg|thumbnail|The Old City of Dubrovnik]]
Article 3 of the Statute of the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] also contains provisions that allow the prosecution of violations of the fundamental principles of the Hague Convention of 1954. On the basis of this article, for the first time since the conclusion of the Convention, proceedings were brought in an international court for the destruction of cultural property during an armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abtahi|first=Hirad|date=|title=The Protection of Cultural Property in Times of Armed Conflict: The Practice of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia|url=https://www.law.upenn.edu/live/files/6418-abtahi-hirad-2001-protection-of-cultural-property|journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the time of its establishment the city of Dubrovnik was under the protection of the [[Byzantine Empire]]; after the Fourth Crusade the city came under the sovereignty of Venice 1205–1358 CE, and by the [[Treaty of Zadar]] in 1358, it became part of the Hungarian-Croatian Kingdom. Following the 1815 Congress of Vienna, the city was annexed by Austria and remained part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire until the conclusion of the First World War. From 1918 to 1939 Dubrovnik was part of the Zetska Banovina District that established its Croatian connections. From 1945 to 1990 Croatia would become part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. One of the most striking features of the historic city of Dubrovnik, and that which gives its characteristic appearance are its intact medieval fortifications. Its historic city walls run uninterrupted encircling the Old-City. This complex structure of fortification is one of the most complete depictions of medieval construction in the Mediterranean, consisting of a series of forts, bastions, casemates, towers and detached forts. Within the Old City are many medieval churches, cathedrals, and palaces from the Baroque period, encircled by its fortified wall, which would ensure its listed place by [[UNESCO]] as a world heritage site in 1972. The Old Town is not only an architectural and urban ensemble of high quality, but it is also full of museums and libraries, such as the collection of the Ragusan masters in the Dominican Monastery, the Museum of the History of Dubrovnik, the Icon Museum, and the libraries of the Franciscan and Dominican Monasteries. It also houses the archives of [[Ragusa (Croatia)|Ragusa]], which have been kept continuously since the 13th century and are a very important source for Mediterranean history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/95|title=Old City of Dubrovnik|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archives hold materials created by the civil service in the Republic of Ragusa.

The Siege of Dubrovnik was a military engagement fought between the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) and Croatian forces which defended the city of Dubrovnik and its surroundings during the Croatian War of Independence. The Old Town was specifically targeted by the JNA even though it served no military purpose to bomb this town. At the heart of the bombing efforts by the JNA elite was the complete eradication of the memory of the Croatian people and history by erasing their cultural heritage and destroying their cultural property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/strugar/cis/en/cis_strugar_en.pdf|title=ICTY Information Sheet on Dubrovnik Case and Strugar|last=|first=|date=|website=ICTY|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court's convictions, which among other charges were also based on this article, were issued in February 2001 against Dario Kordić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/kordic_cerkez/4|title=Kordić &amp; Čerkez (IT-95-14/2) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a commander of the Croatian Defence Council (HVO) during the war in Bosnia, against Miodrag Jokić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/miodrag_jokic/4|title=Jokić, Miodrag (IT-01-42/1) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a senior commander in the navy of the Yugoslav People's Army during the Battle of Dubrovnik in 1991, and against Milan Martić,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/martic/4|title=Martić (IT-95-11) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; a politician and military leader of the internationally unrecognized Republic of Serbian Krajina. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/prlic/4|title=Prlić et al. (IT-04-74) {{!}} International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|website=www.icty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the fire on the bridge.

The historic town of [[Mostar]], spanning a deep valley of the Neretva River, developed in the 15th and 16th centuries as an Ottoman frontier town and during the [[Austro-Hungarian]] period in the 19th and 20th centuries. Mostar was mostly known for its old Turkish houses and specifically the [[Old Bridge, Mostar|Old Bridge]]; the Stari Mostar, after which it is named. In the 1990s conflict with the former Yugoslavia, however, most of the historic town and the Old Bridge were destroyed purposely by Croatian Army and their allies. This type of destruction was in step with that of the Old Town of Dubrovnik, where the aim was the eradication of the memory of the people that once occupied the land, an effort reminiscent of the [[Third Reich]] and the Nazi party. The attacks on the Herzegovinian city of Mostar, which in November 1993 led to the destruction of the Stari most bridge, internationally recognised as an outstanding cultural asset, led to the trial of six defendants before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in April 2006. Among them is the Croatian General Slobodan Praljak, who is suspected of having ordered the firing of the bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/case/prlic/4|title=Prlić et al.

=== Khmer Rouge Tribunal ===
The [[Khmer Rouge Tribunal]], established by the United Nations together with the government of Cambodia in July 2006, has the possibility of prosecuting the destruction of cultural assets during the [[Khmer Rouge]] dictatorship from April 1975 to January 1979, with explicit reference to the Hague Convention of 1954, pursuant to Article 7 of the Law on the Establishment of Extraordinary Chambers.&lt;ref&gt;Law on the establishment of extraordinary Chambers

https://www.eccc.gov.kh/sites/default/files/legal-documents/KR_Law_as_amended_27_Oct_2004_Eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, most of the more than 3,300 temples and 130 mosques in Cambodia were severely damaged by the Khmer Rouge. They also destroyed all 73 Catholic churches and many other sites of religious or cultural significance. The Hague Convention of 1954 can be applied in principle, since Cambodia became a party to the Convention in 1962, before the Khmer Rouge came to power, and because Article 19 of the Convention stipulates that even in non-international armed conflicts, each party to the conflict is bound at least by the provisions on respect for cultural property.

However, it is not yet known whether and to what extent trials will be instituted in the court which are based on the destruction of cultural property. A possible problem with the application of Article 7 and thus with the Hague Convention, is that it is a legal requirement to establish the existence of an armed conflict. This would then resemble the definition commonly used in international humanitarian law. Whether such an assessment of the Khmer Rouge dictatorship will be possible, cannot yet be predicted.

===Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL===
{{main|Destruction of cultural heritage by ISIL}}

Deliberate destruction and theft of cultural heritage has been conducted by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] since 2014 in [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], and to a lesser extent in [[Libya]].  The destruction targets various places of worship under ISIL control and ancient historical artifacts. In Iraq, between the [[fall of Mosul]] in June 2014 and February 2015, ISIL has plundered and destroyed at least 28 historical religious buildings.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01|title=Iraq churches, mosques under ISIL attack|author=Khalid al-Taie|publisher=mawtani.al-shorfa.com|date=13 February 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219092526/http://mawtani.al-shorfa.com/en_GB/articles/iii/features/2015/02/13/feature-01|archivedate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The valuable items from some buildings were looted in order to smuggle and sell them to finance ISIL activities.&lt;ref name="al-shorfa"/&gt;

Although Libya, Syria and Iraq ratified the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict in 1957, 1958 and 1967 respectively,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/eri/la/convention.asp?KO=13637&amp;language=E&amp;order=alpha|title=Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict with Regulations for the Execution of the Convention. The Hague|date=14 May 1954|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has not been effectively enforced.

== International Acceptance and Partnering Organisations ==
As of June 2018, 131 states have become party to the Hague Convention of 1954 and 109 states to the first protocol. 77 states have become party to the Second Protocol of 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/states-parties/|title=States Parties {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council]], France became a party in 1957. Russia is contracting party in legal succession of the Soviet Union, which also became party in 1957. the People's Republic of China ratified the convention in 2000 and the United States acceded in 2009. The United Kingdom signed the Agreement in 1954 and ratified the Convention and acceded to the Protocols in 2017.

The main reason for the long period between signature and ratification by the United States were the reservations of the [[US Department of Defense]] during the [[Cold War]], that the Convention's obligations regarding the possible use of nuclear weapons could not be fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usicomos.org/hague-convention-and-usicomos/|title=Hague Convention and US/ICOMOS|website=www.usicomos.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Chiefs of Staff, to which the commanders-in-chief of all units of the American armed forces belong, unanimously declared itself in 1995 in favour of voluntary compliance with the Convention. On 6 January 1999, then US President Bill Clinton recommended that the US Senate ratify both agreements. In his opinion, they were not only in accordance with the principles and methods of the American Armed Forces, but were even based on them in essential aspects. After the Senate approved accession in September 2008, the US Ambassador to UNESCO, Stephen Engelken, handed over the instrument of ratification to [[Kōichirō Matsuura]], Secretary-General of UNESCO on 13 March 2009. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Convention on 14 May 2004, the Government of the United Kingdom declared its intention to become a party to the Convention and the two Protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/20121223133857/http://www.culture.gov.uk/reference_library/media_releases/2452.aspx|title=[ARCHIVED CONTENT] UK To Ratify Convention Safeguarding Cultural Heri…|date=2012-12-23|work=archive.is|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the conclusion of the Second Protocol of 1999, which, in the view of the British government, eliminated essential weaknesses and ambiguities of the 1954 Convention. A draft law containing ratification of the Convention, the two protocols and criminal law provisions was announced by the UK government in November 2006.

=== UNESCO ===
The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]), a legally independent specialized agency of the United Nations based in Paris, and is the most important international institution in the field of dissemination and implementation of the protection of cultural property in armed conflicts. It acts as depositary of the Hague Convention of 1954 and its two Protocols and administers the "International Register of Cultural Property under Special Protection".

=== Blue Shield International ===
In addition, Blue Shield International (formerly the [[International Committee of the Blue Shield]], ICBS; in French Comité International du Bouclier Bleu, CIBB) has existed since 1996. Its mission is to improve international cooperation in the field of cultural heritage protection and to support local and regional activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53136889|title=A Blue shield for the protection of our endangered cultural heritage : proceedings of the open session co-organized by PAC core activity and the section on national libraries|date=2003|publisher=International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions, Core Acitivity on Preservation and Conservation|others=Koch, Corine., IFLA Programme on Preservation and Conservations.|isbn=2912743028|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=53136889}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Second Protocol of 1999 explicitly mentions in Articles 11 and 27 the consultative role of the International Committee of the Blue Shield in the implementation of the Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/culture/themes/armed-conflict-and-heritage/convention-and-protocols/1999-second-protocol/text/|title=Text  {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the International Committee was founded in 2017, national Blue Shield Committees have already been established in Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Benin, Brazil, Chile, Curacao, Denmark, France, Georgia, Guatemala, Haiti, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Madagascar, Macedonia, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Romania, Senegal, Spain, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and the USA, comparable to the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement]]. These national associations support the work of the International Committee in their respective home countries. The Association of the National Committees of the Blue Shield (ANCBS) was established on September 28, 2006 as its umbrella organization. Since 2017, all international activities have been bundled in Blue Shield International.

While in many wars the freedom of movement of United Nations personnel is significantly restricted due to security concerns, Blue Shield is regarded as particularly suitable due to its structure to act flexibly and autonomously in armed conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Gezielte Zerstörung von (Welt- )Kulturerbe in Krisenländern als Herausforderung für die Vereinten Nationen |author=Sabine Freifrau von Schorlemer |publisher=Nomos Verlagsgesellschaft mbH &amp; Co.

From Blue Shield's point of view, it is not enough to develop and adopt international law norms such as the Second Protocol to the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of Armed Conflict or the Doha Statement of the Conference of 'Ulamâ on Islam and Cultural Heritage'. It is necessary to implement these standards effectively on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://derstandard.at/2000012502400/Bildersturm-in-MossulKlassische-Normen-und-Uebereinkuenfte-versagen|title=Bildersturm: Die globalen Normen zum Schutz von Kulturgut greifen nicht - derStandard.at|website=DER STANDARD|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also concerns the prevention of the illicit trade in antiquities and stolen cultural assets to finance military conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/07/05/real-life-indiana-jones-vs-isis|title=Real-Life Indiana Jones Vs.

=== Other civil society structures ===
The "International League of National Societies for the Protection of Cultural Property", based in the Swiss city of Freiburg, was also established in May 1997 as an international umbrella organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dgks-ev.org/internationale-liga/|title=Internationale Liga – Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturgüterschutz e.V.|website=dgks-ev.org|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the activities of these national and international organisations and associations, which also include the protection of cultural property against disasters in times of peace, [[civil society]] structures will play an increasing role in the field of cultural property protection and support the work of state and international institutions.

One example of international cooperation in the protection of cultural assets was the temporary storage of art treasures from the National Museum in [[Kabul]], [[Afghanistan]], in Switzerland. The art objects, which were severely threatened in the National Museum both by the [[Afghan Civil War (1996–2001)]] that lasted until 1995 and by the subsequent rule of the [[Taliban]] regime, were moved to a so-called "Afghanistan Museum in Exile" in the Swiss town of Bubendorf in 1999 with the consent of all parties to the conflict. The exhibition, which was supported primarily by the voluntary work of Swiss citizens and exiled Afghans, as well as by donations of around 1.5 million Swiss francs and supervised by the Swiss Afghanistan Institute based in Bubendorf, was open to the public from October 2000 to October 2006 and was visited by around 50,000 people during this time. In March 2007, the objects were returned to Kabul under the direction of UNESCO and with the support of the German Air Force. According to the spokesman of the Bubendorf Museum, this was the largest return of art objects since the end of the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.phototheca-afghanica.ch/afghanistanmuseum/|title=Internet - The Afghanistan Museum in Exile|website=www.phototheca-afghanica.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, the Iraqi National Museum in [[Baghdad]] was seriously plundered from 8 to 12 April 2003, some three weeks after the start of the [[Iraq War]]. The museum was reopened only three years earlier on 28 April 2000, some nine years after its closure as a result of the war. Later investigations carried out by a US commission in collaboration with museum staff found evidence of at least three independent incidents.[1] According to the Commission's findings, the looting was sometimes spontaneous and indiscriminate. However, a number of indications also indicated that some of the thieves had a good knowledge of the museum and expert knowledge of the cultural assets on display. Although particularly valuable objects were kept in the cellar of the museum in the run-up to the war, considerable losses were also incurred here. The Commission corrected initial estimates of some 170,000 stolen works of art to 11,000 to 15,000 stolen objects. By the time the study results were published in 2005, about 5,000 of them had been recovered in various ways.

'''Impurities''' are [[chemical substance]]s inside a confined amount of [[liquid]], [[gas]], or [[solid]], which differ from the [[chemical composition]] of the material or compound.

Impurities are either naturally occurring or added during [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] of a chemical or commercial product. During production, impurities may be purposely, accidentally, inevitably, or incidentally added into the substance.

The levels of impurities in a material are generally defined in relative terms.  [[standardization|Standards]] have been established by various organizations that attempt to define the permitted levels of various impurities in a manufactured product.  Strictly speaking, then a material's level of purity can only be stated as being more or less pure than some other material.

==Destructive impurities== 

Impurities can be destructive when they obstruct the working nature of the material. Examples include [[wiktionary:ash|ash]] and [[debris]] in [[metals]] and leaf pieces in blank white papers. The removal of impurities is usually done chemically. For example, in the manufacturing of [[iron]], calcium carbonate is added to the [[blast furnace]] to remove [[silicon dioxide]] from the [[iron ore]]. [[Zone refining]] is an economically important method for the purification of semiconductors.

However, some kinds of impurities can be removed by physical means. A mixture of water and [[salt]] can be separated by [[distillation]], with water as the distillate and salt as the solid [[residue (chemistry)|residue]]. Impurities are usually physically removed from liquids and gases. Removal of sand particles from metal ore is one example with solids.

No matter what method is used, it is usually impossible to separate an impurity completely from a material. The reason that it is impossible to remove impurities completely is of thermodynamic nature and is predicted by the second law of thermodynamics. Removing impurities completely means reducing the [[entropy]] of the system to zero. This would require an infinite amount of work and energy as predicted by the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. What technicians can do is to increase the purity of a material to as near 100% as possible or economically feasible.

==Impurities and nucleation==
When an impure liquid is cooled to its [[melting point]] the liquid, undergoing a [[phase transition]], [[crystal]]lizes around the impurities and becomes a crystalline solid. If there are no impurities then the liquid is said to be pure and can be [[supercooled]] below its melting point without becoming a solid. This occurs because the liquid has nothing to condense around so the solid cannot form a natural crystalline solid. The solid is eventually formed when [[dynamic arrest]] or [[glass transition]] occurs, but it forms into an [[amorphous solid]]&amp;nbsp;– a [[glass]], instead, as there is no [[long-range order]] in the structure.

Impurities play an important role in the nucleation of other phase transitions.   For example, the presence of foreign elements may have important effects on the mechanical and magnetic properties of metal alloys.  Iron atoms in copper cause the renowned [[Kondo effect]] where the conduction electron spins form a magnetic bound state with the impurity atom.    Magnetic impurities in [[superconductors]] can serve as generation sites for [[vortex]] defects.   Point defects can nucleate reversed domains in [[ferromagnet]]s and dramatically affect their [[coercivity]].  In general impurities are able to serve as initiation points for [[phase transition]]s because the energetic cost of creating a finite-size [[Domain wall (magnetism)|domain]] of a new phase is lower at a point defect. In order for the nucleus of a new phase to be stable, it must reach a critical size. This threshold size is often lower at an impurity site.

'''Incest between twins''' or '''twincest'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wagner|first1=Roy|title=An Anthropology of the Subject: Holographic Worldview in New Guinea and its meaning and significance for the world of anthropology|date=2001|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a subclass of [[sibling incest]] and includes both [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] relationships. While in modern Western European culture such behaviour is considered [[incest taboo|taboo]], incest between twins is a common feature in [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Asia]]n (such as Japan) and [[Oceania]]n [[mythology]], and there are a few societies in which the prohibition on it is limited or it is partially accepted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== In Asian culture ==
In traditional [[Bali]]nese culture, it was{{when|date=December 2013}} common for a set of [[twin]]s of the opposite sex to marry each other, since it was assumed that they had had sex in utero. The standard anthropological explanation of this custom is based in explications of the conflicts between [[Cultural heritage|descent]] and affinity in Balinese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twin incest was a common feature of Balinese mythology. As in many other mythologies, the Balinese [[deities]] frequently marry their siblings without any of the incest-related issues faced by similarly-situated human couples.

This was commonplace in [[Southeast Asia]]n [[creation myth]]s which prominently featured twin or sibling couples. In these stories, the brother usually wooed and wed his sister, who bore his child(ren), but on discovering that they are siblings, they are often (but not always) forced to part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Errington, Atkinson |first=Shelley, Jane Monnig|title=Power and Difference: Gender in Island Southeast Asia|year=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-1781-8|pages=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgWrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] mythology, Malakás ("strong") and Magandá ("beautiful"), the first humans on earth, were fraternal twins born of the same bamboo stalk.

An old Japanese myth says that if two [[star-crossed lovers]] commit [[Suicide pact|dual suicide]], they are [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] as fraternal twins.

== In European culture ==
Twin incest is a prominent feature in ancient Germanic mythology, and its modern manifestations, such as the relationship between Siegmund and Sieglinde in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and a feature in some [[Greek mythology]], such as the story of [[Byblis]] and [[Kaunos (mythology)|Kaunos]]. There are strong parallels between the Germanic portrayals of twin incest and those of the Balinese [[Ramayana]], and some scholars have speculated an early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme also appears in [[English literature]], such as the incest between the twins Polydore and Urania in [[Delarivier Manley]]'s ''The New Atlantis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollak|first=Ellen|title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684-1814|year=2003|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-7204-4|pages=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heN14DHX_IIC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1983 review of the scholarly literature on twin homosexuality and twin incest, Ray Bixler concluded that "most same-sex homosexual twins, if reared with their co-twins, do not attempt or even want to seduce them in adulthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bixler |first=Ray H. |date=August 1983 |title=Homosexual Twin Incest Avoidance |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=296–302 |doi=10.1080/00224498309551190  |jstor=3812342}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study drew on [[Edvard Westermarck]]'s [[Westermarck effect|hypothesis]] that sexual desire is generally absent in relationships between members of a [[nuclear family]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edvard Westermarck|Westermarck, Edvard]] (1922). ''The History of Human Marriage'', Vol. II. New York: Allerton, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

One case of incest between twins, in which twins who were adopted by separate families as babies later married without knowing they were brother and sister, was mentioned in a [[House of Lords]] debate on the Human Fertility and Embryology Bill in January 2008. According to the charity Adults Affected by Adoption, there had been other cases of this sort that had involved siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parted-at-birth twins 'married' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7182817.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was widely publicised in the British press,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/shock-for-the-married-couple-who-discovered-they-are-twins-separated-at-birth-6682411.html|title=Shock for the married couple who discovered they are twins separated|last=|first=|date=2008-01-11|website=|publisher=The Evening Standard|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its truthfulness was called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech identical twins Michal and Radek Cuma are male pornographic actors who in 2009 began having sex together in video performances as "Milo and Elijah Peters". They consider themselves both brothers and romantic partners, and report that, outside their video performances with other actors, they have sex solely with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas|last=Rogers|title=Gay Porn's Most Shocking Taboo|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/05/21/twincest/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''infiltration basin''' (also known as a '''recharge basin''' or in some areas, a '''[[sump]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Fagin |first=Dan |title=Ancient, Clean, Controversial: Preserving deep reserves of water is LI's chief environmental issue |year= 2007 |newspaper=Newsday |location=Melville, NY |url=http://regentsearth.com/Projects/Ancient,%20Clean,%20Controversial.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''percolation pond'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://akvopedia.org/wiki/Water_Portal_/_Rainwater_Harvesting_/_Groundwater_recharge_/_Infiltration_ponds|title=Water Portal / Rainwater Harvesting / Groundwater recharge / Infiltration ponds}}&lt;/ref&gt;), is a type of device that is used to manage [[stormwater]] [[surface runoff|runoff]], prevent [[flood]]ing and downstream [[erosion]], and improve [[water quality]] in an adjacent [[river]], [[stream]], [[lake]] or [[bay]]. It is essentially a shallow artificial pond that is designed to [[infiltration (hydrology)|infiltrate]] stormwater through permeable soils into the [[groundwater]] [[aquifer]].  Infiltration basins do not release water except by infiltration, evaporation or emergency overflow during flood conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Pekarek |first1=Kathryn A. |last2=Shelton |first2=David P. |last3=Feehan |first3=Kelly A. |last4=Holm  |first4=Bobbi A. |date=2011 |title=Stormwater Management: Terminology |url=http://extensionpublications.unl.edu/assets/pdf/ec701.pdf |display-authors=1 |publisher=University of Nebraska-Lincoln |page=7 |id=EC701}} Extension Circular.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. Trenton, NJ.[http://www.njstormwater.org/tier_A/pdf/NJ_SWBMP_9.5.pdf "New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513104435/http://www.njstormwater.org/tier_A/pdf/NJ_SWBMP_9.5.pdf |date=2008-05-13 }} Chapter 9.5: Standard for Infiltration Basins. April 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=August 1999 |title=Preliminary Data Summary of Urban Storm Water Best Management Practices |chapter=Ch. 5: Description and Performance of Storm Water Best Management Practices |url=https://www.epa.gov/eg/industrial-wastewater-studies-miscellaneous |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=EPA-821-R-99-012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is distinguished from a [[detention basin]], sometimes called a '''dry pond''', which is designed to discharge to a downstream water body (although it may incidentally infiltrate some of its volume to groundwater); and from a [[retention basin]], which is designed to include a permanent pool of water.

==Design considerations==
Infiltration basins must be carefully designed to infiltrate the soil on a given site, at a rate that will not cause flooding.  They may be less effective in areas with:
*high groundwater levels, close to the infiltrating surface;
*[[soil compaction|compacted soils]];
*high levels of [[sediment]] in stormwater; or
*high [[clay]] soil content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wef.org Water Environment Federation], Alexandria, VA; and [http://www.asce.org American Society of Civil Engineers], Reston, VA. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdU-VXXV_H0C "Urban Runoff Quality Management."] WEF Manual of Practice No. 23; ASCE Manual and Report on Engineering Practice No. 87. 1998. {{ISBN|1-57278-039-8}}. Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some sites infiltration basins have worked effectively where the installation also includes an extended [[detention basin]] as a pretreatment stage, to remove sediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Clar | first1=Michael L. |last2=Barfield |first2=Billy J. |last3=O'Connor |first3=Thomas P. |date=2004 |title=Stormwater Best Management Design Guide; Volume 3: Basin Best Management Practices |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000D1L8.txt |publisher=EPA |chapter=Pretreatment |pages=4–8 |id=EPA 600/R-04/121B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basins may fail where they cannot be frequently maintained, and their use is discouraged in some areas of the [[United States]]. For example, they are not recommended for use in the U.S. state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], which has many areas with high clay soil content, unless soil on the particular site is modified ("engineered soil") during construction, to improve the infiltration characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Atlanta Regional Commission |date=2016 |title=Georgia Stormwater Management Manual, Volume 2 - Technical Handbook |chapter=Infiltration Practices |url=http://www.atlantaregional.com/environment/georgia-stormwater-manual |pages=247–252|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many learned researchers in astronomy, physics, engineering or informatics are working there. 

The institute manages 3 instruments: two parabolic aerials built by CNR and the [[radio telescope]] ''[[Croce del Nord]]'' (Northern Cross) built by the [[University of Bologna]] and inaugurated in 1964.

The institute also operates on: 

*the [[Medicina Radio Observatory]] and the [[VLBI]] aerial in [[Medicina]], [[Emilia-Romagna]]. 
*the [[Noto Radio Observatory]] in [[Noto]], [[Sicily]]
*The new radio telescope [[Sardinia Radio Telescope]] (SRT) in [[Sardinia]].

After the short-lived [[Prague Spring]], he incurred the disfavor of his country's [[Communist Party of Czechoslovakia|Communist regime]] and had to adopt the [[pseudonym]] '''Michal Hájků''' in order to write a series of compositions in a style which evoked earlier periods of music, called ''Storie apocrifa della musica Boema''.

The [[List of compositions by Antonín Dvořák|works of Antonín Dvořák]] are commonly referred to today (as an alternative to the often confusing or absent [[opus number]]s) by their '''Burghauser numbers''', based on an authoritative [[List of compositions by Antonín Dvořák|chronological catalog Burghauser prepared]] of [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]]'s œuvre. Dvořák's pieces were not published in the order he wrote them, and his publisher gave his works opus numbers corresponding to  publishing date. Burghauser has helped greatly to clear up this confusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1979">'''LEEP Online Education''' is a [[distance learning]] program offered by the UIUC iSchool (formerly GSLIS [Graduate School of Library and Information Science]) at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].

The LEEP program provides students who are not able to relocate to the [[Urbana, Illinois|Urbana]]-[[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]] area a means to attend the university's [[American Library Association|ALA]]-accredited [[Master of Library and Information Science]], Master of Information Science or [[Certificate of Advanced Study]] (CAS) program. The program, and the iSchool overall, is ranked #1 by U.S. News &amp; World Report.

==History==

The [[acronym]] LEEP originally stood for Library Education Experimental Program. Founded in 1995, the program is no longer considered experimental.&lt;ref&gt;Catherine A. Thompson, [http://www.nelibraries.org/200606/200606-thompson.htm "LEEPing to an Advanced Library School Degree,"] ''New England Libraries'', Vol. 2, No. 5 (June, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coursework==
LEEP differentiates itself from other distance learning [[library and information science|library and information science (LIS)]] programs through the integration of brief periods of on-campus participation, [[Internet]] instruction through synchronous sessions, and independent learning. Off-campus students attend classes via the school's [[Moodle]] Virtual Learning Environment (VIS) and the Blackboard Collaborate platform. With the 21st LEEP cohort, beginning in the summer/fall of 2016, the on-campus participation was condensed to a weekend program (as opposed to a week+).

'''Medical statistics''' deals with applications of [[statistics]] to [[medicine]] and the [[health science]]s, including [[epidemiology]], [[public health]], [[forensic medicine]], and [[clinical research]]. Medical statistics has been a recognized branch of statistics in the United Kingdom for more than 40 years but the term has not come into general use in North America, where the wider term '[[biostatistics]]' is more commonly used.&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003)  ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{isbn|0-19-850994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "biostatistics" more commonly connotes all applications of statistics to [[biology]].&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt; Medical statistics is a subdiscipline of statistics. "It is the science of summarizing, collecting, presenting and interpreting data in medical practice, and using them to estimate the magnitude of associations and test hypotheses. It has a central role in medical investigations. It not only provides a way of organizing information on a wider and more formal basis than relying on the exchange of anecdotes and personal experience, but also takes into account the intrinsic variation inherent in most biological processes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirkwood|first=Betty R.|title=essential medical statistics|year=2003|publisher=Blackwell|location=Blackwell Science, Inc., 350 Main Street, Malden, Massachusetts 02148–5020, USA|isbn=978-0-86542-871-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pharmaceutical statistics==
'''Pharmaceutical statistics''' is the application of statistics to matters concerning the [[pharmaceutical industry]].  This can be from issues of [[design of experiments]], to analysis of drug trials, to issues of commercialization of a medicine.

There are many professional bodies concerned with this field including:
* European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry (EFSPI)
* [[Statisticians In The Pharmaceutical Industry]] (PSI)

There are also journals including:
* ''[[Statistics in Medicine (journal)|Statistics in Medicine]]''
* ''[[Pharmaceutical Statistics]]''

==Basic concepts==
;For describing situations
* [[Incidence (epidemiology)]] vs. [[Prevalence]] vs. [[Cumulative incidence]]
*all types of medical test results can be true positive or [[false positive]] and true negative or [[false negative]]...these categories are hugely dependent on the prevalence of the disease being tested for; and, for example, a false positive test result is more likely when the prevalence of the disease being tested for is very low (such as a lab test for cold-weather influenza being done  in June in South Carolina, USA. and giving a "positive" result).
* [[Transmission risks and rates|Transmission rate]] vs. [[force of infection]]
* [[Mortality rate]] vs. [[standardized mortality ratio]] vs. [[age-standardized mortality rate]]
* [[Pandemic]] vs. [[epidemic]] vs. [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] vs. [[syndemic]]
* [[Serial interval]] vs. [[incubation period]]
* [[Cancer cluster]]
* [[Sexual network]]
* [[Years of potential life lost]]
* [[Maternal mortality rate]]
* [[Perinatal mortality rate]]
* [[Birth weight|Low birth weight ratio]]

;For assessing the effectiveness of an intervention:
* [[Absolute risk reduction]]
* [[Control event rate]]
* [[Experimental event rate]]
* [[Number needed to harm]]
* [[Number needed to treat]]
* [[Odds ratio]]
* [[Relative risk reduction]]
* [[Relative risk]]
* [[Relative survival]]
* [[Minimal clinically important difference]]

==Related statistical theory==
* [[Survival analysis]]
* [[Proportional hazards models]]
* Active control trials: clinical trials in which a kind of new treatment is compared with some other active agent rather than a placebo.
* ADLS(Activities of daily living scale): a scale designed to measure physical ability/disability that is used in investigations of a variety of chronic disabling conditions, such as arthritis. This scale is based on scoring responses to questions about self-care, grooming, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=S|first=KATZ|author2=FORD A B |author3=MOSKOWITZ R W |author4=JACKSON B A |author5= JAFFE M W |title=STUDIES OF ILLNESS IN THE AGED.

'''Music archaeology''' is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] study field that combines [[musicology]] and [[archaeology]]. As it includes music from numerous cultures, it is often seen as being a part of [[ethnomusicology]], and indeed a study group looking into music archaeology first emerged from ethnomusicological group the ICTM, not from within archaeology.

==Definitions==

"In its broadest sense, music archaeology is the study of the phenomenon of past musical behaviours and sounds", as music archaeologist Adje Both connects several definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Arnd Adje Both, Music Archaeology: Some Methodological and Theoretical Considerations, in: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/i25735471 Yearbook for Traditional Music, Vol. 41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180513001609/https://www.jstor.org/stable/i25735471 |date=13 May 2018 }}, 2009, published by the [http://www.ictmusic.org/group/music-archaeology ICTM] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219215540/http://www.ictmusic.org/group/music-archaeology |date=19 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Music archaeologists use methods of both musicology and archaeology. A theoretical and methodological basic work is still missing and one of the desiderata of the international community of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;Ricardo Eichmann, [http://www.dainst.org/de/profile/ricardo-eichmann?ft=all Einführung in die Musikarchäologie] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413221402/http://www.dainst.org/de/profile/ricardo-eichmann?ft=all |date=13 April 2014 }}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

There are different goals in music archaeology: One of the most important is the exploration of excavated artefacts that are relevant for the reconstruction of ancient music, such as sound-producing devices, representations of musical scenes and textual evidence. The archaeological analysis and documentation of such artefacts, their dating and description as well as the explanation of find contexts and cultural contexts can shed light on its use and function in everyday life of the past, and can help us to rebuild them - i.e., to construct playable replicas.
To produce music in a broader sense may also mean the investigation of early musical notations and literary sources that are "excavated" in libraries or other hidden places. These results may illuminate how instruments were played or how music was sung. But ultimately what was played in ancient times must remain in the dark of the past, and much fantasy is needed by modern musicians to imagine how melodies and rhythms may have been composed. Strictly speaking, only the sound of the instruments can be revived - these are the possibilities and limits of Music Archaeology.
In the last few years the field has expanded considerably, with the inclusion of neurophysiological, biological, and psychological research. These approaches explore the possible beginnings of sound production by seeking the earliest prerequisites in the evolution of mankind for music making and musical 'understanding'.
At the other end of the continuum, newly published evidence for musical notations and theoretical writings, or new literary and iconographic sources relevant to ancient music, can add to our understanding of mostly vanished music cultures. The observation and integration of ethnographic analogies in recent or contemporary societies may also help us discover long lasting traditions in making music which are comparable to the silent past.

==History==

A first attempt to join the two distinct disciplines of Musicology and Archaeology took place at the conference of the International Musicological Society at Berkeley in 1977. One of the round tables was designated "Music and Archaeology", to which were invited specialists to discuss the musical remains of ancient cultures - Bathia Bayer (Israel), Charles Boilès (Mexico), Ellen Hickmann (Egypt), David Liang (China), Casja Lund (Scandinavia). The main stimulus for this was the sensational discovery of an ancient Mesopotamian musical system by Anne D. Kilmer, assyriologist in Berkeley. On the basis of this she was able to advance a decipherment and transcription into Western notation of a late Bronze Age hymn in the Hurrian language, excavated from Ugarit, which contained notation based on the Mesopotamian system. With the help of musicologist Richard L. Crocker (Berkeley) and instrument maker Robert Brown, a replica of a Sumerian lyre was made, and Kilmer's version of the Hurrian hymn was recorded, accompanied by a carefully prepared commentary, as Kilmer/Crocker/Brown, Sounds from Silence, Recent Discoveries in Ancient Eastern Music (LP with information booklet, Bit Enki Publications, Berkeley, 1976). At the round table in Berkeley, Kilmer explained their method of reconstruction and demonstrated the resulting sound. This was the starting point of the [http://www.ictmusic.org/group/music-archaeology ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology], officially founded within the International Council for Traditional Music (ICTM) in Seoul/Korea in 1981, and recognized by the ICTM in New York in 1983 following its first meeting on current music-archaeological research in Cambridge/UK in 1982.

The ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology went on to hold international conferences in Stockholm (1984), Hannover/Wolfenbüttel (1986), Saint Germain-en-Laye (1990), Liège (1992), Istanbul (1993), Jerusalem (1994/1995, together with the ICTM-Study Group for Iconography), and Limassol, Cyprus (1996). These meetings resulted in comprehensive conference reports.

The [[International Study Group on Music Archaeology]] ([http://www.musicarchaeology.org/index.php ISGMA]) has been founded by Ellen Hickmann and Ricardo Eichmann in 1998. The Study Group emerged from the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology with the objective to obtain closer cooperation with archaeologists. Since then, the ISGMA has worked continuously with the German Archaeological Institute, Berlin (DAI, Deutsches Archäologisches Institut, Berlin). A new series called "Studien zur Musikarchäologie" was created as a sub-series of "Orient-Archäologie" to present the conference reports of the ISGMA, and to integrate music-archaeological monographs independent of the Study Group's meetings; it is published by the Orient Department of the DAI through the Verlag Marie Leidorf. Between 1998 and 2004, conferences of ISGMA were held every two years at Michaelstein Monastery, Music Academy of Sachsen-Anhalt (Kloster Michaelstein, Landesmusikakademie Sachsen-Anhalt), sponsored by the German Research Foundation (DFG, Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft).

In close cooperation with the Department for Ethnomusicology at the Ethnological Museum Berlin (Ethnologisches Museum Berlin, SMB SPK, Abteilung Musikethnologie, Medien-Technik und Berliner Phonogramm-Archiv), the 5th and 6th Symposium of the ISGMA were held in 2006 respectively in 2008 at the Ethnological Museum Berlin. In friendly cooperation with the Tianjin Conservatory of Music, the 7th Symposium of the ISGMA was held in Tianjin, China, in 2010. The 8th Symposium of the ISGMA (2012) was also held in China, in Suzhou and Beijing, and the 9th Symposium is being planned for September 2014, again held at the Ethnological Museum Berlin.

Meanwhile, the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology continued separately, and holds its own events, although a number of researchers are involved in both groups. After a couple of years of no activities, Julia L. J. Sanchez re-established the Study Group in 2003 on the initiative of Anthony Seeger, beginning with meetings in Los Angeles, California (2003), and Wilmington, North Carolina (2006). These were followed by a joint-conference in New York (2009), the 11th of the Study Group since its foundation in 1981 (also the 12th Conference of the Research Center for Music Iconography). The 12th conference was then held in Valladolid, Spain (2011), which was the largest meeting of the ICTM Study Group so far, followed by the 13th symposium of the Study Group held in Guatemala 2013. In 2015, the 14th symposium will be held in Poland. In 2013 it was decided to establish a new series, [http://www.ekho-verlag.com/category/series/publications-of-the-ictm-study-group-on-music-archaeology/ Publications of the ICTM Study Group on Music Archaeology], published through [https://www.facebook.com/ekhoverlag Ekho Verlag].

On 27 May 2011 a public concert under the banner of ''Palaeophonics'', funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) ''Beyond Text'' programme and the University of Edinburgh Campaign, took place at the George Square Theatre in Edinburgh. The event showcased the outcomes of collaborative research and creative practice by archaeologists, composers, filmmakers and performers from across Europe and the Americas. Whilst inspired and driven by research in music archaeology, ''Palaeophonics'' represents the emergence of a new, possibly significant, development within the field and within musicology which approaches the subject through the production and performance of new sound and music based multi-media creative works instead of through direct representation and reproduction. Said by some observers as 'experimental' and 'avant-garde', the event provoked mixed feedback from a wide public audience of around 250 people. A related publication is planned and further ''Palaeophonics'' events are thought to be taking place in the future, although none are currently programmed, whilst funding for developing the project is sourced.

In 2013, the [http://www.emaproject.eu European Music Archaeology Project] (EMAP) has been funded by the EU funding programme [http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/index_en.php EACEA], for the period of 5 years. The project will develop a touring exhibition on ancient music in Europe and an elaborate concert and event program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/musik-in-der-steinzeit-eu-projekt-zum-sound-der-vergangenheit-a-937534.html|title=Musik früherer Jahrhunderte: Von wegen alte Leier|first=Angelika|last=Franz|date=28 December 2013|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428122446/http://www.spiegel.de/wissenschaft/mensch/musik-in-der-steinzeit-eu-projekt-zum-sound-der-vergangenheit-a-937534.html|archivedate=28 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archaiologia.gr/en/blog/2013/06/13/listening-to-the-past/&lt;/ref&gt;

In communication studies, '''organizational communication''' is the study of communication within organizations. The flow of communication could be either formal or informal.  

==History==

The field traces its lineage through business information, business communication, and early mass communication studies published in the 1930s through the 1950s. Until then, organizational communication as a discipline consisted of a few professors within speech departments who had a particular interest in [[Speech communication|speaking]] and [[writing]] in business settings. The current field is well established with its own theories and empirical concerns distinct from other fields.

Several seminal publications stand out as works broadening the scope and recognizing the importance of communication in the organizing process, and in using the term "organizational communication". [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] Laureate [[Herbert A. Simon]] wrote in 1947 about "organization communications systems", saying communication is "absolutely essential to organizations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Simon |first=Herbert A. |date=1997 |origyear=1947 |title=Administrative Behavior: A Study of Decision-Making Processes in Administrative Organizations |edition=4th |location=New York |publisher=Free Press |isbn=0684835827 |oclc=35159347}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|208}} [[W. Charles Redding]] played a prominent role in the establishment of organizational communication as a discipline.

In the 1950s, organizational communication focused largely on the role of communication in improving organizational life and organizational output. In the 1980s, the field turned away from a business-oriented approach to communication and became concerned more with the constitutive role of communication in organizing. In the 1990s, [[critical theory]] influence on the field was felt as organizational communication scholars focused more on communication's possibilities to oppress and liberate organizational members.

==Early underlying assumptions==

Some of the main assumptions underlying much of the early organizational communication research were:

* Humans act rationally. Some people do not behave in rational ways, they generally have no access to all of the information needed to make rational decisions they could articulate, and therefore will make unrational decisions, unless there is some breakdown in the communication process—which is common. Irrational people rationalize how they will rationalize their communication measures whether or not it is rational.
* Formal logic and empirically verifiable data ought to be the foundation upon which any theory should rest. All we really need to understand communication in organizations is (a) observable and replicable behaviors that can be transformed into variables by some form of measurement, and (b) formally replicable syllogisms that can extend theory from observed data to other groups and settings
* Communication is primarily a mechanical process, in which a message is constructed and encoded by a sender, transmitted through some channel, then received and decoded by a receiver. Distortion, represented as any differences between the original and the received messages, can and ought to be identified and reduced or eliminated.
* Organizations are mechanical things, in which the parts (including employees functioning in defined roles) are interchangeable. What works in one organization will work in another similar organization. Individual differences can be minimized or even eliminated with careful management techniques.
* Organizations function as a container within which communication takes place. Any differences in form or function of communication between that occurring in an organization and in another setting can be identified and studied as factors affecting the communicative activity.

[[Herbert A. Simon]] introduced the concept of ''[[bounded rationality]]'' which challenged assumptions about the perfect rationality of communication participants. He maintained that people making decisions in organizations seldom had complete information, and that even if more information was available, they tended to pick the first acceptable option, rather than exploring further to pick the optimal solution.

In the early 1990s [[Peter Senge]] developed new theories on organizational communication.  These theories were [[learning organization]] and [[systems thinking]].  These have been well received and are now a mainstay in current beliefs toward organizational communications.

===Communication networks===

Networks are another aspect of direction and flow of communication. Bavelas has shown that communication patterns, or networks, influence groups in several important ways. Communication networks may affect the group's completion of the assigned task on time, the position of the de facto leader in the group, or they may affect the group members' satisfaction from occupying certain positions in the network. Although these findings are based on laboratory experiments, they have important implications for the dynamics of communication in formal organizations.

There are several patterns of communication, such as "chain", "wheel", "star", "all-channel" network, and "circle".&lt;ref name="multiple3"&gt;Summarized from concepts developed by Alex Bavelas, "Communication Patterns in Task-Oriented Groups," pp. 503–11; Harold Guetzkow, "Differentiation of Roles in Task-Oriented Groups," pp. 512–26, in Cartwright and Zander, Group Dynamics; H.J. Leavitt, "Some Effects of Certain Communication Patterns on Group Performance," Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology vol.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Flow nomenclature===
Abbreviations are used to indicate the two-way flow of information or other transactions, e.g. ''B2B'' is "business to business". [[Duplex (telecommunications)|Duplex]] [[Point-to-point (telecommunications)|point-to-point]] communication systems, [[computer network]]s, non-electronic telecommunications, and meetings in person are all possible with the use of these terms. Examples:

==Interpersonal communication==
{{Main|Interpersonal communication}}
One-to-one or ''interpersonal communication'' between individuals may take several forms- messages may be [[Words|verbal]] (that is, expressed in words), or non-verbal such as gestures, facial expressions, and postures ("body language"). [[Nonverbal]] messages may even stem from silence.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Arvid Johnson|title=Management, systems, and society : an introduction|publisher=Goodyear Pub. Co.|location=Pacific Palisades, Calif.|year=1976 |pages=148–142|isbn= 9780876205402|oclc=2299496|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Managers do not need answers to operate a successful business; they need questions. Answers can come from anyone, anytime, anywhere in the world thanks to the benefits of all the electronic communication tools at our disposal.  This has turned the real job of management into determining what it is the business needs to know, along with the who/what/where/when and how of
learning it. To effectively solve problems, seize opportunities, and achieve objectives, questions need to be asked by managers—these are the people responsible for the operation of the enterprise as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, J. F. (2008). ''The Art of Asking: Ask Better Questions, Get Better Answers''. FT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ideally, the meanings sent are the meanings received. This is most often the case when the [[message]]s concern something that can be verified objectively. For example, "This piece of pipe fits the threads on the coupling." In this case, the receiver of the message can check the sender's words by actual trial, if necessary. However, when the sender's words describe a feeling or an opinion about something that cannot be checked objectively, meanings can be very unclear. "This work is too hard" or "Watergate was politically justified" are examples of opinions or feelings that cannot be verified. Thus they are subject to interpretation and hence to distorted meanings. The receiver's background of experience and learning may differ enough from that of the sender to cause significantly different perceptions and evaluations of the topic under discussion. As we shall see later, such differences form a basic barrier to [[communication]].&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

[[Nonverbal]] content always accompanies the verbal content of messages.  When speaking about nonverbal communication, Birdwhistell says "it is complementary to (meaning "adds to") rather than redundant with (or repeating of) the verbal behavior". For example, if someone is talking about the length of an object, they may hold out their hands to give a visual estimate of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Birdwhistell|first1=Ray L.|title=Kinesics and Context: Essays on Body Motion Communication|date=1970|publisher=University of Pensilvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reasonably clear in the case of face-to-face communication. As [[Virginia Satir]] has pointed out, people cannot help but communicate symbolically (for example, through their clothing or possessions) or through some form of body language. In messages that are conveyed by the telephone, a messenger, or a letter, the situation or context in which the message is sent becomes part of its non-verbal content. For example, if the [[company]] has been losing [[money]], and in a letter to the production division, the [[front office]] orders a reorganization of the shipping and receiving departments, this could be construed to mean that some people were going to lose their jobs — unless it were made explicitly clear that this would not occur.&lt;ref name="Virginia"&gt;{{cite book |author= Virginia Satir|title= Conjoint family therapy; a guide to theory and technique|publisher= Science and Behavior Books|location= Palo Alto, Calif.|year=1967|pages=76–81|isbn=|oclc=187068|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of variables influence the [[effectiveness]] of [[communication]]. Some are found in the environment in which communication takes place, some in the personalities of the sender and the receiver, and some in the relationship that exists between [[sender]] and [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]. These different variables suggest some of the difficulties of communicating with understanding between two people. The sender wants to formulate an idea and communicate it to the receiver. This desire to communicate may arise from his thoughts or feelings or it may have been triggered by something in the environment. The [[communication]] may also be influenced by the relationship between the sender and the receiver, such as status differences, a staff-line relationship, or a learner-teacher relationship.&lt;ref name="Virginia"/&gt;

Whatever its origin, [[information]] travels through a series of filters, both in the sender and in the receiver, and is affected by different channels, before the idea can be transmitted and re-created in the receiver's mind. Physical capacities to see, hear, smell, taste, and touch vary between people, so that the image of reality may be distorted even before the mind goes to work. In addition to physical or sense filters, cognitive filters, or the way in which an individual's mind interprets the world around him, will influence his assumptions and feelings. These filters will determine what the sender of a message says, how he says it, and with what purpose. Filters are present also in the receiver, creating a double complexity that once led [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] to say that human communication is "doubly relative". It takes one person to say something and another to decide what he said.&lt;ref name="Simon"&gt;{{cite book |author=James G March;  Herbert A Simon|title= Organizations|publisher=Wiley|location=New York|year=1958|pages=9–11|isbn= 9780471567936|oclc=1329335|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical and cognitive, including semantic [[wiktionary:Filter|filter]]s (which decide the meaning of words) combine to form a part of our memory system that helps us respond to reality. In this sense, March and Simon compare a person to a data processing system. Behavior results from an interaction between a person's internal state and environmental stimuli. What we have learned through past experience becomes an inventory, or data bank, consisting of values or goals, sets of expectations and preconceptions about the consequences of acting one way or another, and a variety of possible ways of responding to the situation. This memory system determines what things we will notice and respond to in the environment. At the same time, stimuli in the environment help to determine what parts of the memory system will be activated. Hence, the memory and the environment form an interactive system that causes our behavior. As this interactive system responds to new experiences, new learnings occur which feed back into memory and gradually change its content. This process is how people adapt to a changing world.&lt;ref name="Simon"/&gt;

==Formal and informal==
Informal and formal communication are used in an organization. Communication flowing through formal channels are downward, horizontal and upward whereas communication through informal channels are generally termed as grapevine.

Informal communication, generally associated with interpersonal, horizontal communication, was primarily seen as a potential hindrance to effective organizational performance. This is no longer the case. Informal communication has become more important to ensuring the effective conduct of work in modern organizations.

Grapevine is a random, unofficial means of informal communication. It spreads through an organization with access to individual interpretation as gossip, rumors, and single-strand messages. Grapevine communication is quick and usually more direct than formal communication. An employee who receives most of the grapevine information but does not pass it onto others is known as a ''dead-ender''. An employee that receives less than half of the grapevine information is an ''isolate''. Grapevine can include destructive miscommunication, but it can also be beneficial from allowing feelings to be expressed, and increased productivity of employees. 

Top-down approach: This is also known as downward communication. This approach is used by the top level management to communicate to the lower levels. This is used to implement policies, guidelines, etc. In this type of organizational communication, distortion of the actual information occurs. This could be made effective by feedbacks.

Additionally, [[Constitutive role of communication in organizations|McPhee and Zaug]] (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McPhee|first=R.|author2=Zaug, P.|title=The Communicative Constitution of Organizations: A framework for explanation|journal=Electronic Journal of Communication/La Revue Electronique de Communication|year=2000|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  take a more nuanced view of communication as constitutive of organizations (also referred to as [[Constitutive role of communication in organizations|CCO]]). They identify four constitutive flows of communication, formal and informal, which become interrelated in order to constitute organizing and an organization:
* organizational self-structuring
* membership negotiation
* activity coordination
* institutional positioning.

== Perspectives==
Shockley-Zalabak identified the following two perspectives, essentially as ways of understanding the organizational communication process as a whole.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shockley-Zalabak|first1=Pamela S.|title=Fundamentals of Organizational Communication|date=2015|publisher=Pearson|location=United States of America|edition=9th}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}}

=== The functional tradition===
According to Shockley-Zalabak, the functional tradition is "a way of understanding organizational communication by describing what messages do and how they move through organizations." There are different functions within this process that all work together to contribute to the overall success of the organization, and these functions occur during the repetition of communication patterns in which the members of the organization engage in.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|28}} The first types of functions are message functions which are "What communication does or how it contributes to the overall functioning of the organization", and we describe message functions in three different categories which are organizational functions, relationship functions, and change functions.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|30–31}} Organizing functions as Shockley-Zalabak states, are "Messages that establish the rules and regulations of a particular environment". These messages can include items such as newsletters or handbooks for a specific organization, that individuals can read to learn the policies and expectations for a certain company.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|31}} Relationship functions are "Communication that helps individuals define their roles and assess the compatibility of individual and organizational goals". These relationship functions are a key aspect to how individuals identify with a company and it helps them develop their sense of belonging which can greatly influence their quality of work.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|31–32}} The third and final subcategory within message functions are change functions, which are defined as "messages that help organizations adapt what they do and how they do it". Change messages occur in various choice making decisions, and they are essential to meet the employee's needs as well as have success with continual adaptations within the organization.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|32}}

===The meaning centered approach===
According to Shockley-Zalabak, the meaning centered approach is "a way of understanding organizational communication by discovering how organizational reality is generated through human interaction". This approach is more concerned with what communication is instead of why and how it works, and message functions as well as message movement are not focused on as thoroughly in this perspective.&lt;ref name="Shockley-Zalabak"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

==Research==

===Research methodologies===
Historically, organizational communication was driven primarily by quantitative research methodologies. Included in functional organizational communication research are [[statistical]] analyses (such as [[Statistical survey|surveys]], text indexing, [[network mapping]] and [[behavior]] [[scientific model|modeling]]). In the early 1980s, the [[interpretive]] revolution took place in organizational communication. In Putnam and Pacanowsky's 1983 text ''Communication and Organizations: An Interpretive Approach''. they argued for opening up methodological space for [[qualitative research|qualitative]] approaches such as [[narrative]] analyses, participant-observation, [[interviewing]], [[rhetorical|rhetoric]] and textual approaches readings) and philosophic inquiries.

In addition to qualitative and quantitative research methodologies, there is also a third research approach called mixed methods. "Mixed methods is a type of procedural approach for conducting research that involves collecting, analyzing, and mixing quantitative and qualitative data within a single program of study. Its rationale postulates that the use of both qualitative and quantitative research provides a better and richer understanding of a research problem than either traditional research approach alone provides."&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Abeza |first1=Gashaw |last2=O'Reilly |first2=Norm |last3=Dottori |first3=Mark |last4=Séguin |first4=Benoit |last5=Nzindukiyimana |first5=Ornella |date=January 2015 |title=Mixed methods research in sport marketing |journal=International Journal of Multiple Research Approaches |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=40–56 |doi=10.1080/18340806.2015.1076758}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42}} Complex contextual situations are easier to understand when using a mixed methods research approach, compared to using a qualitative or quantitative research approach. There are more than fifteen mixed method design typologies that have been identified.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|42}} Because these typologies share many characteristics and criteria, they have been classified into six different types. Three of these types are sequential, meaning that one type of data collection and analysis happens before the other. The other three designs are concurrent, meaning both qualitative and quantitative data are collected at the same time.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

===Sequential explanatory design===
To achieve results from a sequential explanatory design, researchers would take the results from analyzing quantitative data and get a better explanation through a qualitative follow up. They then interpret how the qualitative data explains the quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

===Sequential exploratory design===
Although sequential exploratory design may resemble sequential explanatory design, the order in which data is collect is revered. Researchers begin with collecting qualitative data and analyzing it, then follow up by building on it through a quantitative research method. They use the results from qualitative data to form variables, instruments and interventions for quantitative surveys and questionnaires.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

===Sequential transformative design===
Researchers in line with sequential transformative design are led by a "theoretical perspective such as a conceptual framework, a specific ideology, or an advocacy position and employs what will best serve the researcher's theoretical or ideological perspective".&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|44}} Therefore, with this research design, it could be either the qualitative or quantitative method that is used first and priority depends on circumstance and resource availability, but can be given to either.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|44}}

===Concurrent triangulation design===
With a concurrent triangulation design, although data is collected through both quantitative and qualitative methods at the same time, they are collected separately with equal priority during one phase. Later, during the analysis phase, the mixing of the two methods takes place.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

===Concurrent embedded design===
In a concurrent embedded design, again, both qualitative and quantitative data is collected, although here one method supports the other. Then, one of the two methods (either qualitative or quantitative) transforms into a support for the dominant method.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

===Concurrent transformative design===
The concurrent transformative design allows the researcher to be guided by their theoretical perspective, so their qualitative and quantitative data may have equal or unequal priority. Again, they are both collected during one phase.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;{{rp|45}}

Mixed methods capitalizes on maximizing the strengths of qualitative and quantitative research and minimizing their individual weaknesses by combining both data.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt; Quantitative research is criticized for not considering contexts, having a lack of depth and not giving participants a voice. On the other hand, qualitative research is criticized for smaller sample sizes, possible researcher bias and a lack of generalizability.&lt;ref name="Abeza 2015"/&gt;

During the 1980s and 1990s critical organizational scholarship began to gain prominence with a focus on issues of [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Social class|class]], and power/knowledge. In its current state, the study of organizational communication is open methodologically, with research from [[postpositivism|post-positive]], [[interpretive]], [[critical theory|critical]], [[postmodern]], and [[discourse|discursive]] paradigms being published regularly.

Organizational communication scholarship appears in a number of communication journals including but not limited to ''[[Management Communication Quarterly]]'', ''[[Journal of Applied Communication Research]]'', ''[[Communication Monographs]]'', ''[[Academy of Management Journal]]'', ''[[Communication Studies]]'', and ''Southern Communication Journal''.

==Current research topics==
In some circles, the field of organizational communication has moved from acceptance of mechanistic models (e.g., information moving from a sender to a receiver) to a study of the persistent, hegemonic and taken-for-granted ways in which we not only use communication to accomplish certain tasks within organizational settings (e.g., public speaking) but also how the organizations in which we participate affect us.

These approaches include "postmodern", "critical", "participatory", "feminist", "power/political", "organic", etc. and adds to disciplines as wide-ranging as sociology, philosophy, theology, psychology, business, business administration, institutional management, medicine (health communication), neurology (neural nets), semiotics, anthropology, international relations, and music.

Currently, some topics of research and theory in the field are:

'''Constitution''', e.g.,
* how communicative behaviors construct or modify organizing processes or products
*how communication itself plays a [[Constitutive role of communication in organizations|constitutive role in organizations]]
* how the organizations within which we interact affect our communicative behaviors, and through these, our own identities
* structures other than organizations which might be constituted through our communicative activity (e.g., markets, cooperatives, tribes, political parties, social movements)
* when does something "become" an organization? When does an organization become (an)other thing(s)? Can one organization "house" another? Is the organization still a useful entity/thing/concept, or has the social/political environment changed so much that what we now call "organization" is so different from the organization of even a few decades ago that it cannot be usefully tagged with the same word&amp;nbsp;– "organization"?

'''Narrative''', e.g.,
*how do group members employ narrative to acculturate/initiate/indoctrinate new members?
*do organizational stories act on different levels? Are different narratives purposively invoked to achieve specific outcomes, or are there specific roles of "organizational storyteller"? If so, are stories told by the storyteller received differently from those told by others in the organization?
*in what ways does the organization attempt to influence storytelling about the organization? under what conditions does the organization appear to be more or less effective in obtaining a desired outcome?
*when these stories conflict with one another or with official rules/policies, how are the conflicts worked out? in situations in which alternative accounts are available, who or how or why are some accepted and others rejected?

'''Identity''', e.g.,
* who do we see ourselves to be, in terms of our organizational affiliations?
* do communicative behaviors or occurrences in one or more of the organizations in which we participate effect changes in us?  To what extent do we consist of the organizations to which we belong?
* is it possible for individuals to successfully resist organizational identity? what would that look like?
* do people who define themselves by their work-organizational membership communicate differently within the organizational setting than people who define themselves more by an avocational (non-vocational) set of relationships?
* for example, researchers have studied how human service workers and firefighters use humor at their jobs as a way to affirm their identity in the face of various challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Tracy |first= S.J. |author2=K. K. Myers |author3=C. W. Scott |year= 2006 |journal=Communication Monographs |volume= 73|pages=283–308 |doi= 10.1080/03637750600889500 |title= Cracking Jokes and Crafting Selves: Sensemaking and Identity Management Among Human Service Workers |issue= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have examined the identities of police organizations, prison guards, and professional women workers.

'''Interrelatedness''' of organizational experiences, e.g.,
* how do our communicative interactions in one organizational setting affect our communicative actions in other organizational settings?
* how do the phenomenological experiences of participants in a particular organizational setting effect changes in other areas of their lives?
* when the organizational status of a member is significantly changed (e.g., by promotion or expulsion) how are their other organizational memberships affected?
* what kind of future relationship between business and society does organizational communication seem to predict?

'''[[Power (sociology)|Power]]''' e.g.,
* How does the use of particular communicative practices within an organizational setting reinforce or alter the various interrelated power relationships within the setting? Are the potential responses of those within or around these organizational settings constrained by factors or processes either within or outside of the organization&amp;nbsp;– (assuming there is an "outside")?
* Do taken-for-granted organizational practices work to fortify the dominant [[hegemonic]] narrative? Do individuals resist/confront these practices, through what actions/agencies, and to what effects?
* Do status changes in an organization (e.g., promotions, demotions, restructuring, financial/social strata changes) change communicative behavior? Are there criteria employed by organizational members to differentiate between "legitimate" (i.e., endorsed by the formal organizational structure) and "illegitimate" (i.e., opposed by or unknown to the formal power structure) behaviors? When are they successful, and what do we mean by "successful" when there are "pretenders" or "usurpers" who employ these communicative means?

[[File:LysonsWoodchesterOrpheus-1-.jpg|thumb|The [[Woodchester]] Orpheus mosaic, drawn as found in 1797]]
'''Orpheus mosaics''' are found throughout the [[Roman Empire]], normally in large [[Roman villa]]s. [[Orpheus]] was a popular subject in classical art, and was also used in [[Early Christian art]] as a symbol for [[Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Hachilli, 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard depiction in [[Roman mosaic]] scenes (for the Romano-British variant see below) shows him seated and playing a [[lyre]] or [[cithara]], wearing a [[Phyrgian cap]], often beside a tree, and includes many animals drawn and pacified by his playing. The fox was considered Orpheus's special animal and may be placed beside him. In large examples the animals spread to occupy the whole floor of a room.  Titles such as ''Orpheus Charming/Taming the Beasts'' may be used.&lt;ref&gt;Hachilli, 72-74; Henig, 153&lt;/ref&gt;  Usually the whole scene occupies the same space, but sometimes Orpheus and the animals are each in compartments separated by borders with geometrical decoration.

An example of the usual composition with animals in the 6th-century [[Gaza synagogue]] is identified as [[David]] by an inscription in Hebrew, and has added royal attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Hachilli, 72-74&lt;/ref&gt;  Another adaptation is a Christian mosaic of [[Adam]] giving names to the animals ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 2: 19-20) in a church of around 486-502 in [[Apamea, Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;Hachilli, 74&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the mosaics seem to relate to the rather elusive philosophical or religious doctrines of [[Orphism (religion)|Orphism]].&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 152, but see Drijvers, H. J. W., [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=69YUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA191 ''Cults and Beliefs at Edessa''], p. 191, 1980, Brill Archive, {{ISBN|9004060502}}, 9789004060500&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Byzantine mosaic]] large scenes with animals tended to be hunting scenes (one of the largest being again at Apamea).  These are, at least initially, drawn from the popular [[venatio]] ("hunting") displays in the [[Roman amphitheatre|amphitheatre]]s, where a variety of exotic beasts were released to fight and be killed.&lt;ref&gt;Kondoleon, 271-314&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite the contrast in atmosphere, the Berlin mosaic from a house in [[Miletus]] manages to combine both a ''venatio'' and an Orpheus with animals in its two parts.&lt;ref&gt;Kondoleon, 282&lt;/ref&gt;  A staged scene in the arena recorded by [[Martial]] combined an acted [[Orpheus]] with the punishment of criminals by ''[[damnatio ad bestias]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kondoleon, 310-311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romano-British composition==
In what appears to be a unique feature of Orpheus mosaics from [[Roman Britain]], the animals may be arranged parading in a circle around him, feet facing out, so that some are the right way up whatever angle the floor is seen from; nine examples are known.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbabin, 92-94; [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-23529098 "Roman Orpheus mosaic to be displayed at Bristol museum"], BBC, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject is found, for example, in [[Woodchester]] in England, the second largest of its kind in Europe and one of the most intricate. It dates to c. AD 325 and was re-discovered by Gloucestershire-born [[antiquarian]] [[Samuel Lysons]] in 1793. It has been uncovered seven times since 1880,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wUuIAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT147 dates]&lt;/ref&gt; the last time in 1973, but there are no plans to reveal it again.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbabin, 92-94; Henig, 152-154; G. Thomas, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Other English examples are at [[Littlecote Roman Villa]],&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 154, and 152-154 generally on British mosaics&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brading Roman Villa]],&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 153&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Corinium Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://coriniummuseum.org/object/2015-71-2/ Corinium Museum page]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another, from [[Newton St Loe]], is now in [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]], but between 1841 and 1851 had been moved to [[Keynsham railway station]], and set in a floor there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-23529098 "Roman Orpheus mosaic to be displayed at Bristol museum"], BBC, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  The Corinium (that is, modern [[Cirencester]]) example gives its name to the "Corinium Orpheus School" of Romano-British mosaic artists.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbabin, 92-94&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two other circular Orpheus mosaics, in [[Volubilis]] in present-day [[Morocco]], and [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] in Spain, but the compositions are different.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbabin, 92, note&lt;/ref&gt;

The Littlecote mosaic in particular, which seems to have been added to a room used as some kind of private space for religious cult, has been suggested as evidencing a syncretic cult of Orpheus, Apollo and Bacchus.&lt;ref&gt;Henig, 154&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
A large example takes up all the floor of a room in the [[Villa Romana del Casale]], [[Piazza Armerina]], Sicily, one of the finest sites for mosaics.  Other notable examples are in [[Leptis Magna]] in [[Libya]] (''in situ''),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livius.org/articles/place/lepcis-magna/photos/lepcis-magna-villa-of-the-orpheus-mosaic/ "Lepcis Magna, Villa of the Orpheus Mosaic"]&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Palermo]], [[Arles]], the Musée gallo-romain in [[Saint-Romain-en-Gal]] [[Vienne]], [[Perugia]] and the [[Bardo National Museum (Tunis)]].  A new Orpheus mosaic has recently been found found in [[Prusias ad Hypium]], near present-day [[Duzce]] in Turkey.

'''Out of the Ordinary''' Festival was an annual family- and eco-friendly [[festival]] near [[Hailsham]] (grid reference TQ  569 088)&lt;ref&gt;http://streetmap.co.uk/idgc.srf?x=556900&amp;y=108800&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Sussex]] countryside. It celebrated the [[autumn equinox]] in [[England]] with a variety of live music,&lt;ref name="cobley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazine.brighton.co.uk/Home/Editorial/Out%20Of%20The%20Ordinary:%20Autumn%20Equinox%20Festival%20Announce%20Music%20Line-Up/21_45_2988 |last=Cobley |first=Mike |title=Out Of The Ordinary: Autumn Equinox Festival Announce Music Line-Up |website=brighton.co.uk |date=15 September 2009|accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; talks and workshops, performances, activities for children with green and ethical businesses, many powered by solar panels and wind generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brighton-hove.gov.uk/index.cfm?request=b1000327&amp;event_id=B114CB610EFB35CB802574C0003458EE&amp;cDate=14-Sep-08&amp;caller=showWeek&amp;action=showEvent |title=Out of the Ordinary Festival |publisher=Brighton &amp; Hove Council|date=2008 |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It started as a development of The Antiquarian Society in [[Brighton]]. The festival took place for three days in the [[autumn]] and had a capacity of 5,000 people. The festival was held at Knockhatch Park, a setting which comprises an ex-landfill site (Arlington Landfill Site, near Hailsham - grid reference TQ 569 088).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eastsussex.gov.uk/nr/rdonlyres/53d65748-d86e-40a6-aa54-00e32d6f3ebb/0/arlington.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Festival details ==

The Out of the Ordinary business was started by Stuart Mason and his partner Emily in 2007 on the [[Sussex Downs]] near the vale of the [[Long Man of Wilmington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/outordinary/efestivals |title=Out of the Ordinary Festival |date=2 September 2009 |accessdate=19 March 2011 |publisher=efestivals.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workshops and talks included such topics as [[prehistoric]] culture, ancient knowledge and [[earth mysteries]]. This included [[yoga]], [[meditation]], [[alternative healing]] and the chance to use a variety of [[telescopes]], a [[planetarium]] and laser guided tours of the [[constellation]]s. Notable speakers include Professor [[Gordon Hillman]], [[Jonathan Cainer]], [[Andy Thomas]], Edmund Marriage, Leo Rutherford and [[Robert Bauval]].&lt;ref name="sussex"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wellbeingmagazine.co.uk/article/out-ordinary-festival |title=Sussex Downs College co-sponsors music stage at the OOTO festival |date=2010 |accessdate=19 March 2011 |work=Well Being}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival was divided into seven areas named after each of the seven [[chakras]]. The music area was appropriately named the throat chakra with two stages, the Ootopia and Peace Stage, as well as an indoor bar and the Conscious Cabaret. In 2011, the site had a new, simplified layout comprising the four elements, though still paying tribute to the seven chakras that defined its inner workings. The festival has an eclectic mix of music ranging from [[Folk Music|folk]] to [[reggae]] and [[Electronic Music|electronic]] and [[DJ]]s. [[Sussex Downs College]] co-sponsored a [[solar-powered]] music stage at the festival in 2010.&lt;ref name="sussex"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10586">In [[political science]], [[political economy|political economics]], and [[peace and conflict studies]], referring to the [[military–industrial complex]], the '''peace–industrial complex''' defines the industry and economy derived from [[international development|development]], [[peacemaking]], [[peacebuilding]], and [[conflict resolution]] at both the domestic and foreign levels. While some scholars (Seiberling 1972) argue that the peace–industrial complex must oppose the military-industrial complex, others (Aberkane 2012) argue it is destined to become its natural, peaceful evolution, and further call it the "military-industrial complex 2.0". The latter argue the peace-industrial complex more precisely consists of turning military [[research and development]] into civilian technology as systematically as possible. Although it has been discussed in more recent times the concept was introduced as early as in 1969 by the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations]].&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969 p.147&lt;/ref&gt;

== In relation to the War Against War ==

=== Origin of the Peace-industrial complex ===
At least two approaches to the [[War Against War]] may be distinguished, the frontal opposition to war or [[Anti-war movement]] on the one side and the transcendent, post-war conception of [[William James]]' 'Moral Equivalent of war' positing, in the way of the [[UNESCO]], that the only way to end conflicts is to make Humanity busy with more fascinating endeavors than wars. In his Nobel acceptance speech [[Martin Luther King]] further underlined that idea which would become the basis of the transcendentist school (e.g. Aberkane):

{{cquote| We will not build a peaceful world by following a negative path. It is not enough to say "We must not wage war." It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war, but on the positive affirmation of peace. There is a fascinating little story that is preserved for us in Greek literature about [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s. The Sirens had the ability to sing so sweetly that sailors could not resist steering toward their island. Many ships were lured upon the rocks, and men forgot home, duty, and honor as they flung themselves into the sea to be embraced by arms that drew them down to death. Ulysses, determined not to be lured by the Sirens, first decided to tie himself tightly to the mast of his boat, and his crew stuffed their ears with wax. But finally he and his crew learned a better way to save themselves: they took on board the beautiful singer [[Orpheus]] whose melodies were sweeter than the music of the Sirens. When Orpheus sang, who bothered to listen to the Sirens?&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-lecture.html Martin Luther King, Nobel Lecture, Dec. 11th 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:Martin Luther King, Jr..jpg|thumb|right|200px| Official picture of Martin Luther King Jr. at the Nobel Foundation, 1964]]

Various scholars (Suter 1986, Aberkane 2012, Roberts 2009) and politicians (Seiberling 1972) have thus advocated that peace profiteering should simply be made palatably larger than any possible [[war profiteering]], thus transcending the war against war. However, the first generations of Peace-Industrial scholars have advocated frontal opposition to the military-industrial complex rather than its transcendent, voluntary metamorphosis into a globally benevolent yet very profitable peace-industrial complex.

[[File:John F. Seiberling 93rd Congress 1973.jpg|thumb|right|200px| US. Rep. John F. Seiberling circa the time of his 1972 address to the Congress calling for a Peace-industrial complex]]

In 1986 [[Keith Suter|Keith D. Suter]] defended his Ph.D dissertation on ''Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex'',&lt;ref&gt;Suter, K. D.  Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex, Ph.D Thesis, Deakin University, Victoria, 1986 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kwAcNQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was further cited in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Summy, R. Salla, M.E 'Why the Cold War Ended: A Range of Interpretations' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995 p.202&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a Peace–industrial complex had already been introduced as early as in 1969 in the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969 p.147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ83AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The original quote affirmed direct opposition to the military-industrial complex and was therefore not transcendent in nature: "It is time for the United States to break the Huge military-industrial complex and begin in its stead a people and peace-industrial complex". It received further citation throughout the 1970s. The notion appeared in the '[[United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology|United States Congress House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development' in 1972&lt;ref&gt;National science policy and priorities act of 1972: Hearings, Ninety-second Congress, second session U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1972 p.153 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kXsqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwADgK]&lt;/ref&gt;  in a congressional address by US [[John F. Seiberling|Rep. J.F. Seiberling]] (1972)&lt;ref&gt;Rep. J. F. Seiberling, "The case for economic conversion" Congressional record v.118, n°95, 13 June 1972, pp E6177-6179, cited in Science Policy Reviews, Volumes 4 à 5 Battelle Memorial Institute, 1972 p. 398 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ggQFAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgK], see also Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress, Volume 118, Part 16 U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972 p.20738 [https://books.google.com/books?id=G20Udh7ynykC&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjgK]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suter further defended that "each country create a national Ministry for Peace",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i4pinternational.org/files/202/7.+national+ministries+for+peace.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; which was contemporary to the creation of the Ministry for Peace Australia (MFPA) initiative and the Global Alliance for Ministries &amp; Infrastructures for Peace (GAMIP). An Education for a Peace Industrial Complex conference (EPIC) is also mentioned in a 1984 issue of the Nuclear Times.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Times, Volumes 3 to 4, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Transcendentist school ===
If Kofi J. Roberts&lt;ref&gt;Roberts K. J. The Sargasso Bridge, iUniverse 2009 p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly called for the substitution of a military-industrial complex by a peace industrial complex which would enable the focusing of federal spendings on construction rather than destruction, [[Idriss Aberkane|Idriss J. Aberkane]] further defended the transcendent approach to the peace-industrial complex by calling it the "military-industrial complex 2.0" and thus neither the enemy nor the political complement to the military industrial complex but rather its natural, inevitable evolution on the account that investors (either institutional or private) will inevitably realize the larger profitability of construction over destruction. Aberkane also advocates the political viability of a peace-industrial complex by declaring that in the 21st century, what he calls "weapons of mass construction" will grant much larger political leverage, leadership and [[soft power]] than weapons of mass destruction.

{{cquote| every time a military technology makes it to civilian use it changes the world for good and what it brings you is love rather than hatred, for if you project destruction you're gonna be hated, if you project construction, you're gonna be loved. So what is power, truly, what is a [[superpower]]? Is it a nation that has [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]? No it is not! Many nations have weapons of mass destruction they are not all superpowers (...) when you're looking at [[The Pentagon]] you're looking at a [[Military budget of the United States|budget]] of 740 billion US dollars, that's the budget of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] plus de [[Expenditures in the United States federal budget#Discretionary spending|discretionary budget]] that is allocated to Research and Development for defense. I'm not saying we should take it away from the Pentagon, I say we should move to the Pentagon 2.0. For so far, what has America gained in projecting every bits of these dollars? Every time America uses these dollars is it more loved? Is it more respected? Is it safer? Is it more trusted? Does it have more leadership? (...) America could project this money to gain love, respect, leadership and political power. This, is the military-industrial complex 2.0. [It] will be interested in weapons of mass construction rather than weapons of mass destruction because these weapons are the future in terms of power. For what was the power of the 20th century? In the 20th century power was [[Nuclear winter|the ability to go from a beautiful blue planet to a red one]]. If you could turn a blue planet into a red one you were powerful. We have the technology to do that, these (sic) are called weapons of mass destruction. Do we have the technology to go the other way around? Can we [[Terraforming|turn a red planet - Mars in that case - into a beautiful green planet]]? We can't but when you're looking at a budget of seven hundred billions US dollars you can look into that. This is gonna be 21st century power, weapons of mass construction. Why? because if you project these weapons I guarantee you people are gonna love you&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLIzupsfiV8 Aberkane, Bring on the Peace-Industrial Complex, Wikistage Paris 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is generally accepted that the mechanism of mineral phosphate solubilization by PSB strains is associated with the release of low molecular weight [[organic acids]], through which their [[hydroxyl]] and [[carboxyl]] groups chelate the [[cations]] bound to phosphate, thereby converting it into soluble forms. PSB have been introduced to the Agricultural community as phosphate [[Biofertilizer]]. Phosphorus (P) is one of the major essential macronutrients for plants and is applied to soil in the form of phosphate fertilizers. However, a large portion of soluble inorganic phosphate which is applied to the soil as chemical fertilizer is immobilized rapidly and becomes unavailable to plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Mohammad Ali Malboobi |author2=Parviz Owlia |author3=Mandana Behbahani |author4=Elaheh Sarokhani |author5=Sara Moradi |author6=Bagher Yakhchali |author7=Ali Deljou |author8=Kambiz Morabbi Heravi |title=Solubilization of organic and inorganic phosphates by three highly efficient soil bacterial isolates |date=2009 |journal=World Journal of Microbiology and Biotechnology |volume= 25 |issue= 8 |doi=10.1007/s11274-009-0037-z|pages=1471–1477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the main purpose in managing soil phosphorus is to optimize crop production and minimize P loss from soils. PSB have attracted the attention of agriculturists as soil inoculums to improve the plant growth and yield. When PSB is used with [[rock phosphate]], it can save about 50% of the crop requirement of phosphatic fertilizer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} The use of PSB as inoculants increases P uptake by plants. Simple inoculation of seeds with PSB gives crop yield responses equivalent to 30&amp;nbsp;kg P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; /ha or 50 percent of the need for phosphatic fertilizers. Alternatively, PSB can be applied through fertigation or in hydroponic operations. Many different strains of these bacteria have been identified as PSB, including ''[[Pantoea agglomerans]]'' (P5), ''[[Microbacterium laevaniformans]]'' (P7) and ''[[Pseudomonas putida]]'' (P13) strains are highly efficient insoluble phosphate solubilizers. Recently, researchers at Colorado State University demonstrated that a consortia of four bacteria (sold commercially as [http://www.mammothmicrobes.com Mammoth P]), synergistically solubilize phosphorus at a much faster rate than any single strain alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baas|first=Peter|last2=Bell|first2=Colin|last3=Mancini|first3=Lauren M.|last4=Lee|first4=Melanie N.|last5=Conant|first5=Richard T.|last6=Wallenstein|first6=Matthew D.|date=2016-06-14|title=Phosphorus mobilizing consortium Mammoth P™enhances plant growth|url=https://peerj.com/articles/2121/|journal=PeerJ|language=en|volume=4|pages=e2121|doi=10.7717/peerj.2121|issn=2167-8359|pmc=4911952|pmid=27326379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, phosphate (P) compounds are capable of immobilizing heavy metals, especially Pb, in contaminated environments through phosphate-heavy metal precipitation. However, most P compounds are not readily soluble in soils so it is not readily used for metal immobilization.  Phosphate solubilizing bacteria (PSB) have the potential to enhance phosphate-induced immobilization of metals to remediate contaminated soil. However, there is a limit on the amount of phosphate which can be added to the environment due to the issue of eutrophication.&lt;ref&gt;Park, J. H., Bolan, N., Megharaj, M., &amp; Naidu, R. (2011). Isolation of phosphate solubilizing bacteria and their potential for lead immobilization in soil. Journal of hazardous materials, 185(2), 829-836.&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphate is often adsorbed onto the surface of different type of minerals, for example iron containing minerals. Recent data suggest that bacteria growin under phosphorus starvation release iron-chelating molecules. Considering the geochemical interaction between these two elements, the authors suggest that some bacteria can dissolve iron-containing minerals in order to access the adsorbed phosphate &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Romano S, Bondarev V, Kölling M, Dittmar T, Schulz-Vogt HN | title = Phosphate limitation triggers the dissolution of precipitated iron by the marine bacterium Pseudovibrio sp.

'''Randolph–Macon College''' is a private, [[co-education]]al [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] located in [[Ashland, Virginia]], [[United States]], near the capital city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Founded in 1830, the school has an enrollment of more than 1,400 students. The college offers [[bachelor's degree]]s in 38 major disciplines in the [[liberal arts]], including [[political science]], [[business]], [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[international relations|international studies]], and [[computer science]], as well as 34 minors, including [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmc.edu/Academics.aspx |title=Academics: Majors &amp; Minors |publisher=Randolph-Macon College |accessdate=June 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140611125002/http://www.rmc.edu/Academics.aspx |archive-date=2014-06-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph–Macon College is a member of the [[Annapolis Group]] of colleges in the United States, as well as the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges.

== History ==
Randolph–Macon was founded in 1830 by the Virginia [[Methodists]] and is the second-oldest Methodist-run college in the country. It was originally located in [[Boydton, Virginia|Boydton]], near the [[North Carolina]] border; but as the railroad link to Boydton was destroyed during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the college's trustees decided to relocate the school to Ashland in 1868. The college takes its name from Virginia statesmen [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] and North Carolina statesman [[Nathaniel Macon]]. (The original site of Randolph–Macon features a historical marker and ruins of the classroom buildings.)

In 1847, Randolph–Macon College established a relationship with the [[Hampden–Sydney College]]. The relationship led to the formation of the Randolph–Macon Medical School, which closed in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markeroni.com/catalog/display.php?code=VA_F_069 Landmarks Visited Catalog: Randolph-Macon Medical School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308033004/http://markeroni.com/catalog/display.php?code=va_f_069 |date=2016-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its president [[William Andrew Smith (educator)|William A. Smith]] delivered a set of lectures advocating slavery in 1856 and 1857.&lt;ref&gt;http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/smith/bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The college has a historical relationship with [[Randolph College]] (formerly known as Randolph–Macon Woman's College) in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. The former women's college was founded under Randolph–Macon's original charter in 1893 by the then-president William Waugh Smith; it was intended as a female counterpart to the then all-male Randolph–Macon. The two schools later separated to become distinct institutions governed by two separate boards.  Randolph–Macon College became [[co-education]]al in 1971 with the enrollment of 50 women and the first full-time female faculty member.  (Randolph College became co-educational in 2007.)

In 1892, two [[University-preparatory school|preparatory schools]] — both called Randolph–Macon Academy — were founded. The only one that remains today is [[Randolph–Macon Academy]] in [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], [[Virginia]]. Randolph–Macon Academy is today the only co-educational military boarding school in the country affiliated with the [[United States Air Force]] [[Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (AFJROTC).

Randolph–Macon College became the first college south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] to require physical education coursework for graduation. The old gym, built in 1887, was the first structure in the South to be constructed solely for instruction in physical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Virginia E.|title=Randolf-Macon College (Campus History)|date=2011|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, S.C.|isbn=978-0738587141|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Randolph–Macon is considered to be the first college in the [[Southern United States|South]] to offer English as a full discipline and to develop biology as a distinct study.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, James. ''Randolph-Macon College: A Southern History, 1825-1967.'' University Press of Virginia, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its computer science department is one of the oldest in the country associated with a liberal arts school; in the 1960s when the program was established, many academics believed computer science to be more appropriate for a commercial trade or secretarial school than a traditional four-year institution.

Since 1923, the college has been home to the Zeta of Virginia chapter of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]], the nation's oldest academic honor society.  Chi Beta Phi, the national science honorary society, was founded at Randolph–Macon in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmc.edu/why-rmc/about/history/timeline04.aspx History of Randolph-Macon College] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805124018/http://www.rmc.edu/why-rmc/about/history/timeline04.aspx |date=2012-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic program ==
Randolph–Macon College offers a broad-based curriculum in the liberal arts and sciences.  The education emphasizes the development of critical thinking skills and effective oral and written communication.  All students must satisfy the general collegiate curriculum, which requires them to take courses in each of the Areas of Knowledge: [[civilization]]s, [[art]]s and [[literature]], [[social science]]s, [[natural science|natural]] and [[mathematics]], foreign languages, and [[health|wellness]].

Randolph–Macon offers two undergraduate degrees: the [[Bachelor of Arts]] and the [[Bachelor of Science]].  The college awards degrees in 38 majors: [[Accounting]], [[Archaeology]],  [[Art History]], [[Arts Management]], [[Asian studies]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Classical Studies]], [[Communication Studies]], [[Computer Science]], [[Drama]], [[Economics]], [[Economics/Business]], [[Engineering Physics]], [[English language|English]], [[Environmental Studies]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[History]], [[International studies]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Mathematics]], [[Music]], [[Nursing]], [[Philosophy]], [[Physics]], [[Political Science]], [[Pre-Engineering]], [[Pre-law]], [[Pre-med]], [[Pre-ministry]], [[Psychology]], [[Religious Studies]], [[Sociology]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Studio Art]], and [[Women's studies]].

The student-faculty ratio is 12:1.&lt;ref name="faculty"/&gt;

=== Calendar ===
Randolph–Macon operates on a 4-1-4 academic calendar. This allows for two four-month semesters (fall and spring) with a one-month term in January to split up the semesters. During the January Term (colloquially called "J-Term"), students are afforded the opportunity to take intensive study courses on the Randolph–Macon campus, travel the globe as part of a study-abroad course, or participate in professional internships in their field(s) of study and interest.

=== Four-Year Degree Guarantee ===
In 2011, Randolph–Macon announced a Four-Year Degree Guarantee program. The College guarantees that entering freshmen will graduate in four calendar years and, if qualifying students are not able to meet that requirement, then Randolph–Macon College will waive tuition costs for the courses that the student needs to complete their degree.

Randolph–Macon College has over 60 academic, administrative, athletic, and residential buildings on its campus of {{convert|116|acre|km2}} located in the heart of Ashland, Virginia.  The oldest building is Washington-Franklin Hall, built in 1872, soon after the college moved to Ashland from Boydton.  It was the first brick building in Ashland, and its construction was funded by the students.  Renovated in 1987, Washington-Franklin Hall now houses the history department.  Pace-Armistead Hall was built in 1876 (renovated 1997) and originally housed the chemistry department.  Today, it is home to the studio art department, including the Flippo Art Gallery.  The original Duncan Methodist Church was built in 1879 and was renovated to include classrooms and offices for the music and arts departments.  All three buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and collectively they make up "Historic Campus."

Copley Science Center is the largest academic building on campus.  The biology, chemistry, physics/astrophysics, environmental studies, computer science, and mathematics departments are all located in Copley.  Copley Science Center was built as an extension of Smithey Hall, which today houses the psychology department.  Just north of Copley is [[Keeble Observatory]], which includes a 12" Cassegrain reflector optical telescope, and two [[radio telescope]]s.

Randolph–Macon has one main library: McGraw-Page Library.  Formerly, the library was located in Peele Hall, which is now the main administrative building on-campus and includes the Copy Center, Registrar's Office, Human Resources, provost, dean of students, and the president.

There are 12 residence halls on campus.  The seven halls on the north end of campus are collectively known as the Freshman Village.  About 75% of the college's freshmen live in one of those halls.  The four located near the center of campus house upperclassmen and the remaining freshmen.  These include the two oldest residence halls - Thomas Branch Hall and Mary Branch Hall.  The college also owns most of the fraternity and sorority houses, other houses devoted to special interest groups, and on-campus townhouses (usually reserved for seniors). Andrews Hall, named after former Dean of Students Rev. Ira Andrews, opened in fall 2011. The newest residence hall, Birdsong Hall, named for Constance and Thomas Birdsong '49, opened in fall 2014. Birdsong Hall provides state-of-the-art housing for upperclassmen, including common areas, study rooms, and laundry facilities.

The College announced a $100 million capital campaign in 2011.  A large portion of the funds will go toward enhancing facilities, including two new residence halls, new football and baseball fields and stadiums, additions and renovations to the McGraw-Page Library and Copley Science Center, along with the destruction of the Brown Campus Center that was rebuilt into the Brock Commons in 2013.

The main north-south railroad line for the east coast runs through the campus.  Most of the campus is located to the east of the railroad, but a handful of college offices, special interest houses, and athletic fields are located to the west of the tracks.  The Ashland train station (not part of the R-MC campus) is directly across from the southern entrance to the campus.

== Athletics ==
{{main article|Randolph–Macon Yellow Jackets}}

Randolph–Macon's [[college athletics|sports]] teams are known as the '''Yellow Jackets''' or, more simply, as "The Jackets." Randolph–Macon College plays in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC), a member of Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

Men's sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, and tennis. Women's sports include basketball, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. Men's volleyball will be added in the 2019 season (2018–19 school year).

The college maintains a Hall of Fame of former especially accomplished athletes based upon their past athletic records.

'''Regional science''' is a field of the [[social science]]s concerned with analytical approaches to problems that are specifically [[Urban area|urban]], [[rural]], or [[region]]al. Topics in regional science include, but are not limited to [[location theory]] or spatial economics, location modeling, transportation, migration analysis, [[land use]] and [[urban development]], [[input-output analysis|interindustry analysis]], environmental and [[ecology|ecological]] analysis, [[resource management]], urban and regional [[policy]] analysis, [[geographical information systems]], and [[spatial data analysis]]. In the broadest sense, any social science analysis that has a spatial dimension is embraced by regional scientists.

==Origins==
Regional science was founded in the late 1940s when some [[economist]]s began to become dissatisfied with the low level of regional [[economics|economic]] analysis and felt an urge to upgrade it. But even in this early era, the founders of regional science expected to catch the interest of people from a wide variety of disciplines. Regional science's formal roots date to the aggressive campaigns by [[Walter Isard]] and his supporters to promote the "objective" and "scientific" analysis of settlement, industrial location, and urban development. Isard targeted key universities and campaigned tirelessly. Accordingly, the [[Regional Science Association]] was founded in 1954, when the core group of scholars and practitioners held its first meetings independent from those initially held as sessions of the annual meetings of the American Economics Association.&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. 1975. ''Introduction to Regional Science.'' New York: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;  A reason for meeting independently undoubtedly was the group's desire to extend the new science beyond the rather restrictive world of economists and have natural scientists, psychologists, anthropologists, lawyers, sociologists, political scientists, planners, and geographers join the club.&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. 1975. ''Introduction to Regional Science.'' New York: Prentice Hall, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Now called the [[Regional Science Association International]] (RSAI), it maintains subnational and international associations, journals, and a conference circuit (notably in North America, continental Europe, [[Japan]], and [[South Korea]]). Membership in the RSAI continues to grow.

==Seminal publications==

Topically speaking, regional science took off in the wake of [[Walter Christaller]]'s book ''Die Zentralen Orte in Sűddeutschland'' (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1933; transl. ''Central Places in Southern Germany'', 1966), soon followed by [[Tord Palander]]'s (1935) ''Beiträge zur Standortstheorie''; [[August Lösch]]'s ''Die räumliche Ordnung der Wirtschaft'' (Verlag von Gustav Fischer, Jena, 1940; 2nd rev. edit., 1944; transl. ''The Economics of Location'', 1954) ; and [[Edgar M. Hoover]]'s two books--''Location Theory and the Shoe and Leather Industry'' (1938) and ''The Location of Economic Activity'' (1948). Other important early publications include: [[Edward Chamberlin|Edward H. Chamberlin]]'s (1950) ''The Theory of Monopolistic Competition'' ; [[François Perroux]]'s (1950) ''Economic Spaces: Theory and Application''; [[Torsten Hägerstrand]]'s (1953) ''Innovationsförloppet ur Korologisk Synpunkt''; [[Edgar S. Dunn]]'s (1954)''The Location of Agricultural Production'' ; [[Martin J. Beckmann]], C.B McGuire, and Clifford B. Winston's (1956) ''Studies in the Economics of Transportation''; [[Melvin L. Greenhut]]'s (1956) ''Plant Location in Theory and Practice''; [[Gunnar Myrdal]]'s (1957) ''Economic Theory and Underdeveloped Regions''; [[Albert O. Hirschman]]'s (1958) ''The Strategy of Economic Development''; and [[Claude Ponsard]]'s (1958) ''Histoire des Théories Économiques Spatiales''. Nonetheless, Walter Isard's first book in 1956, ''Location and Space Economy'', apparently captured the imagination of many, and his third, ''Methods of Regional Analysis'', published in 1960, only sealed his position as the father of the field.

As is typically the case, the above works were built on the shoulders of giants. Much of this predecessor work is documented well in Walter Isard's ''Location and Space Economy''&lt;ref&gt;Isard, Walter. 1956. ''Location and Space-Economy: A General Theory Relating to Industrial Location, Market Areas, Land Use, Trade and Urban Structure'' Cambridge, Massachusetts: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Claude Ponsard's ''Histoire des Théorie Économique Spatiales''.&lt;ref&gt;Ponsard, Claude. 1958. ''Histoire des Théories Économiques Spatiales''. Paris: Librairie Armand Colin (Translated in 1983 by Benjamin H. Stevens, Margaret Chevallier and Joaquin P. Pujol as ''History of Spatial Economic Theory''. Springer-Verlag: New York.)&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly important was the contribution by 19th century German economists to [[location theory]]. The early German hegemony more or less starts with [[Johann Heinrich von Thünen]] and runs through both [[Wilhelm Launhardt]] and [[Alfred Weber]] to [[Walter Christaller]] and [[August Lösch]].

==Core journals==

If an academic discipline is identified by its journals, then technically regional science began in 1955 with the publication of the first volume of the ''Papers and Proceedings, Regional Science Association'' (now ''[[Papers in Regional Science]]'' published by [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]). In 1958, the  ''[[Journal of Regional Science]]'' followed. Since the 1970s, the number of journals serving the field has exploded. The [http://www.regionalscience.org/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;layout=category&amp;task=category&amp;id=95&amp;Itemid=619 RSAI website] displays most of them.

Most recently the journal ''[[Spatial Economic Analysis]]'' has been published by the RSAI British and Irish Section with the ''[[Regional Studies Association]]''. The latter is a separate and growing organisation involving economists, planners, geographers, political scientists, management academics, policymakers, and practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk/ Regional Studies Association – Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219053606/http://www.regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk/ |date=2008-12-19 }}. Regional-studies-assoc.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic programs==

[[Walter Isard]]'s efforts culminated in the creation of a few academic departments and several university-wide programs in regional science. At Walter Isard's suggestion, the [[University of Pennsylvania]] started the Regional Science Department in 1956. It featured as its first graduate [[William Alonso]] and was looked upon by many to be the international academic leader for the field. Another important graduate and faculty member of the department is [[Masahisa Fujita]]. The core curriculum of this department was [[microeconomics]], [[input-output analysis]], [[location theory]], and [[statistics]]. Faculty also taught courses in [[mathematical programming]], [[transportation economics]], [[labor economics]], energy and ecological policy modeling, [[spatial statistics]], spatial interaction theory and models, [[benefit/cost analysis]], urban and regional analysis, and economic development theory, among others. But the department's unusual multidisciplinary orientation undoubtedly encouraged its demise, and it lost its department status in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, David. 2004. "A Short History of the field of Regional Science," ''Papers in Regional Science,'' 83, 31–57. The source for a few dates in this paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;

With a few exceptions, such as [[Cornell University]], which awards graduate degrees in Regional Science,&lt;ref&gt;[http://aap.cornell.edu/crp/programs/regsci/ Cornell College of Architecture, Art, and Planning, Department of City and Regional Planning: About Regional Science]&lt;/ref&gt; most practitioners hold positions in departments such as economics, geography, [[civil engineering]], [[agricultural economics]], [[rural sociology]], urban planning, public policy, or [[demography]]. The diversity of disciplines participating in regional science have helped make it one of the most interesting and fruitful fields of academic specialization, but it has also made it difficult to fit the many perspectives into a curriculum for an academic major. It is even difficult for authors to write regional science textbooks, since what is elementary knowledge for one discipline might be entirely novel for another.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Loveridge discusses the pros and cons of a multidisciplinary field. [http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm link]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624065420/http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm |date=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public policy impact==
Part of the movement was, and continues to be, associated with the political and economic realities of the role of the local community. On any occasion where public policy is directed at the sub-national level, such as a city or group of counties, the methods of regional science can prove useful. Traditionally, regional science has provided policymakers with guidance on the following issues:&lt;ref&gt;Classical regional science questions. [http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm link]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624065420/http://www.rri.wvu.edu/loveridgeintroregsci.htm |date=June 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Regional economic impact of the arrival or departure of a firm
:*Determinants of internal migration patterns and land-use change
:*Regional specialization and exchange
:*Environmental impacts of social and economic change
:*Geographic association of economic and social conditions

By targeting federal resources to specific geographic areas the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration realized that political favors could be bought. This is also evident in Europe and other places where local economic areas do not coincide with political boundaries. In the more current era of devolution knowledge about "local solutions to local problems" has driven much of the interest in regional science. Thus, there has been much political impetus to the growth of the discipline.

==Developments after 1980==
Regional science has enjoyed mixed fortunes since the 1980s. While it has gained a larger following among economists and public policy practitioners, the discipline has fallen out of favor among more radical and [[post-modernist]] geographers. In an apparent effort to secure a larger share of research funds, geographers had the [[National Science Foundation]]'s Geography and Regional Science Program renamed "Geography and Spatial Sciences".

===New economic geography===
In 1991, [[Paul Krugman]], as a highly regarded international trade theorist, put out a call for economists to pay more attention to economic geography in a book entitled ''Geography and Trade'', focusing largely on the core regional science concept of  agglomeration economies. Krugman's call renewed interest by economists in regional science and, perhaps more importantly, founded what some term the "new economic geography", which enjoys much common ground with regional science. Broadly trained "new economic geographers" combine quantitative work with other research techniques, for example at the [[London School of Economics]]. The unification of Europe and the increased internationalization of the world's economic, social, and political realms has further induced interest in the study of regional, as opposed to national, phenomena.  The new economic geography appears to have garnered more interest in Europe than in America where amenities, notably climate, have been found to better predict human location and re-location patterns, as emphasized in recent work by Mark Partridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1435-5957.2010.00315.x | volume=89 | title=The duelling models: NEG vs amenity migration in explaining US engines of growth | journal=Papers in Regional Science | pages=513–536 | last1 = Partridge | first1 = Mark D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Krugman won the [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences]] and his Prize Lecture has references both to work in regional science's location theory as well as economic's trade theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economics/laureates/2008/krugman-lecture.html Paul Krugman's Nobel Prize Lecture 2008]. Nobelprize.org (2008-12-08). Retrieved on 2011-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms===
Today there are dwindling numbers of regional scientists from academic [[planning]] programs and mainstream [[geography]] departments. Attacks on regional science's practitioners by radical critics began as early as the 1970s, notably [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] who believed it lacked social and political commitment. Regional science's founder, Walter Isard, never envisioned regional scientists would be political or planning activists. In fact, he suggested that they will seek to be sitting in front of a computer and surrounded by research assistants. [[Trevor J. Barnes]] suggests the decline of regional science practice among planners and geographers in North America could have been avoided. He says "It is unreflective, and consequently inured to change, because of a commitment to a God’s eye view. It is so convinced of its own rightness, of its Archimedean position, that it remained aloof and invariant, rather than being sensitive to its changing local context." &lt;ref&gt;Barnes in ''Canadian J of Reg. Sci''.

'''''Rethinking "Gnosticism": An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category''''', is a 1996 book by Michael Allen Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Michael allen|title=Rethinking "Gnosticism:" An Argument for Dismantling a Dubious Category|date=1996|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0-691-01127-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is one of the first critical works that goes about comparing the established academic definitions of [[gnosticism]] to the texts discovered at [[Nag Hammadi library|Nag Hammadi]]. The main points of the book are that there is no established definition of "gnosticism" by people who use the term, let alone the academic world; and that the groups referred to as "gnostic" by the [[Christian]] Church [[apologist]]s referred to themselves often by their leader or leaders' names but no group referred to themselves as "gnostic" or "gnostics".

Also, Williams mentions the [[argument]] that none of the groups labeled "gnostic" shared a common set of beliefs that put them in a group together. The only things close to this would be the Christian [[heresiographical]] use of referring to these varied groups as "gnostics". As well as the varied set of interruptions of the creator of the material world ([[Yahweh]] or [[demiurge]]) by these early groups. Finally Williams clarifies that the ancient "gnosticism" of the Nag Hammadi groups and the misused "gnosticism" of moderns groups and academia have little if anything in common. Williams suggests a better and more adequate term for these [[heresy|heretical]] groups would be "biblical [[demiurge|demiurgical]] traditions".

In 1956, [[Anthony F. C. Wallace]] published a paper called '''"Revitalization Movements"''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sjsu.edu/people/mira.amiras/courses/c10/s2/AFC_Wallace_RevitalizationMvt.pdf   Wallace, Anthony F.C. 1956. "Revitalization Movements," ''[[American Anthropologist]]'' 58: 264-281.]&lt;/ref&gt; to describe how [[culture]]s change themselves.   A revitalization movement is a "deliberate, organized, conscious effort by members of a society to construct a more satisfying culture" (p.&amp;nbsp;265), and Wallace describes at length the processes by which a revitalization movement takes place.

Wallace' model 1956 describes the process of a '''revitalization movement'''. It is derived from studies of a Native American religious movement, The Code of [[Handsome Lake]], which may have led to the formation of the [[Longhouse Religion]]. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{Plainlist|
*I. ''Period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to a group's social and natural environment.
*II. ''Period of increased individual stress''. While the group as a whole is able to survive through its accustomed  cultural behavior, changes in the social or natural environment frustrate efforts of many people to obtain normal satisfactions of their needs.
*III. ''Period of cultural distortion''. Changes in the group's social or natural environment drastically reduce the capacity of accustomed cultural behavior to satisfy most persons' physical and emotional needs.
*IV. ''Period of revitalization'': (1) reformulation of the cultural pattern; (2) its communication; (3) organization of a reformulated cultural pattern; (4) adaptation of the reformulated pattern to better meet the needs and preferences of the group; (5) cultural transformation; (6) routinization, when the adapted reformulated cultural pattern becomes the standard cultural behavior for the group.
*V. ''New period of generally satisfactory adaptation'' to the group's changed social and/or natural environment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace derived his theory from studies of so-called primitive peoples (preliterate and homogeneous), with particular attention to the [[Iroquois]] revitalization movement led by [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] religious leader and [[prophet]] [[Handsome Lake]] (1735-1815). Wallace believed that his revitalization model applies to movements as broad and complex as the rise of [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], or [[Wesleyanism|Wesleyan Methodism]].

Revitalizaton is a part of social movements.

Scholars such as Vittorio Lanternari (1963) and Peter Worsley (1968) have developed and adapted Wallace's insights.

'''Roots of Europe''' (full name: '''Roots of Europe – Language, Culture, and Migrations''') is an interdisciplinary research centre at the [[University of Copenhagen]], focusing on [[prehistoric Europe]]. It is headed by [[Birgit Anette Olsen]] (2008-2013 by [[Jens Elmegård Rasmussen]]) and involves more than 40 linguists, archaeologists, geneticists and other scholars from universities in Europe and the USA. 
The centre was initiated in 2008 and is financed through the University of Copenhagen Programmes of Excellence. It has close ties to the local programme in [[Indo-European studies]]. It is physically based at the Department of Nordic Studies and Linguistics and hosts the departmental collection of Indo-European linguistics handbooks.

==Structure and activities ==

The common research projects are organized from Copenhagen. While the basic working group there mainly concentrates on the linguistic aspects, the external project members deal both with linguistics, religion and mythology, archaeology and genetics. An international advisory board covers all of the basic fields. From 2013 onwards, the centre also functions as an umbrella for several new research projects, which do not form part of the original programme but are founded by the [[VELUX]] foundation and the Danish Research Council for the Humanities.
Research results emerging from the projects are published mainly in the book series [[Copenhagen Studies in Indo-European]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8683">The '''School Health Education Study''' (SHES) was a crucial event in transforming [[health education]] as practiced in [[Public school (government funded)|American public schools]]. It has been called, "the most significant school health education initiative of the 1960s"&lt;ref&gt;Allensworth, et al. 1997 p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; and was largely responsible for establishing the value of comprehensive health education rather than separate disease-specific units and in introducing the concept-based approach to education in general. Most health curricula developed since have followed the model set by the SHES in its School Health Curriculum Project.&lt;ref&gt;Allensworth, et al., 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
In 1960 millionaire distiller and philanthropist [[Samuel Bronfman]] asked Dr. Granville Larimore, then Deputy Commissioner of the New York State Department of Health and a member of the Joint Committee on Health Problems in Education of the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA) and the [[National Education Association]] (NEA), to suggest several projects in health or education that should receive funding but were being neglected by governmental and private funders. Dr. Larimore suggested three priorities: (I) graduate medical education, (2) effectiveness of the mass media for health education, and (3) school health education. After hearing presentations on each of these three priorities, the [[Samuel Bronfman Foundation]]’s board decided to provide $200,000 for a study of the status of health education in the nation’s schools.

== Initial study ==
The Study was envisioned as an independent, two-year-long investigation, affiliated with the [[American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance|American Association for Health, Physical Education and Recreation]] (AAHPER) and the National Education Association. Bronfman sought the advice of [[Delbert Oberteuffer]], professor at the [[Ohio State University]] and widely regarded as the leading figure in health education at that time, regarding who could best lead the study. Oberteuffer recommended one of his young OSU colleagues, [[Elena Sliepcevich]]. Dr. Sliepcevich accepted the appointment and moved to Washington, DC where the SHES leased office space on Dupont Circle in the building next door to the NEA.&lt;ref&gt;Johns, 1962; Means, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first year, the Study assessed the state of health education offerings in a total of 135 school systems covering 38 states and involving some 1101 individual [[Primary education|elementary schools]] and 359 secondary schools. This survey remains the broadest of its type ever completed in the United States. In the second year test instruments were administered to students in grades 6, 9, and 12 of the participating schools. Of 17,634 usable answer sheets re¬turned to the researchers, a weighted sample of 2000 scores for each of the three [[grade level]]s representative of the makeup of the school sample was selected for analysis. Analysis of the results required a third year of Bronfman Foundation support and led to the conclusion that the state of health education in the nation’s public schools was "appalling".&lt;ref&gt;Sliepcevich, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

== School Health Curriculum Project ==
The [3M] Corporation funded SHES for a further six years (1963–1969) to develop a model curriculum—the School Health Curriculum Project or SHCP. Ann E. Nolte, of Ohio State University, joined SHES as associate director of the study and a curriculum writing team was assembled, consisting of:  William H. Creswell, Jr., professor of health education at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]]; Gus T. Dalis, of the Los Angeles County Schools; Edward B. Johns, professor of school health education at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]; Marion B. Pollock, assistant professor of health education at [[California State University, Long Beach|California State College, Long Beach]]; Richard K. Means, professor of health education at [[Auburn University]]; and [[Robert D. Russell]], associate professor of health education at [[Southern Illinois University]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof. Russell proposed as the initial point of view for the SHCP that health was a unified concept of well-being. This was expressed in the curriculum as follows, "Health is a quality of life involving dynamic interaction and interdependence among the individual's physical well-being, his (or her) mental and emotional reactions, and the social complex in which he (or she) exists".&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, et al., 1967, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  From this starting point, the SHCP writers identified ten key concepts. Sub concepts were then developed in the physical, mental, and social dimen¬sions for each of the ten concepts. The 31 sub concepts were each linked to behavioral objectives written at four progressive levels—grades K-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12—in the cognitive, affective, and behavioral domains.

== Concepts ==
The ten concepts developed by the SHES as the basis for the SHCP were:
# Growth and development influences and is influenced by the structure and functioning of the individual.
# Growing and developing follows a predictable sequence, yet is unique for each individual.
# Protection and promotion of health is an individual, community, and international responsibility.
# The potential for hazards and accidents exists, whatever the environment.
# There are reciprocal relationships involving man (humanity), disease, and environment.
# The family serves to perpetuate man (humanity) and to fulfill certain health needs.
# Personal health practices are affected by a complexity of forces, often conflicting.
# Utilization of health information, products, and services is guided by values and perceptions.
# Use of substances that modify mood and behavior arises from a variety of motivations.
# Food selection and eating patterns are determined by physical, social, mental, economic, and cultural factors.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell, et al., 1967, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[File:sonicbm2.ogg|thumb|right|250px|Aircraft sonic boom. {{deletable image-caption|Monday, 21 December 2009}}]] --&gt;
A '''sonic boom''' is the sound associated with the [[shock wave]]s created whenever an object travelling through the air travels faster than the [[speed of sound]]. Sonic booms generate enormous amounts of [[sound]] energy, sounding similar to an [[explosion]] or a [[thunder]]clap to the human ear. The crack of a supersonic [[bullet]] passing overhead or the crack of a [[bullwhip]] are examples of a sonic boom in miniature.&lt;ref name="americanscientist.org"&gt;[http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2002/9/crackin-good-mathematics Mike May, ''Crackin' Good Mathematics'', American Scientist, Volume 90, Number 5, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonic booms due to large supersonic aircraft can be particularly loud and startling, tend to awaken people, and may cause minor damage to some structures. They led to prohibition of routine supersonic flight over land. Although they cannot be completely prevented, research suggests that with careful shaping of the vehicle the nuisance due to them may be reduced to the point that overland supersonic flight may become a practical option.

A sonic boom does not occur only at the moment an object crosses the speed of sound; and neither is it heard in all directions emanating from the speeding object. Rather the boom is a continuous effect that occurs while the object is travelling at supersonic speeds. But it only affects observers that are positioned at a point that intersects a region in the shape of a geometrical cone behind the object. As the object moves, this conical region also moves behind it and when the cone passes over the observer, they will briefly experience the ''boom''.

==Causes==
When an aircraft passes through the air it creates a series of [[P-wave|pressure waves]] in front of the aircraft and behind it, similar to the [[Bow wave|bow and stern waves]] created by a boat. These waves travel at the [[speed of sound]] and, as the speed of the object increases, the waves are forced together, or compressed, because they cannot get out of each other's way quickly enough. Eventually they merge into a single shock wave, which travels at the speed of sound, a critical speed known as ''Mach 1'', and is approximately {{convert|1235|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} at sea level and {{convert|20|C|F}}.

In smooth flight, the shock wave starts at the nose of the aircraft and ends at the tail.  Because the different radial directions around the aircraft's direction of travel are equivalent (given the "smooth flight" condition), the shock wave forms a ''Mach cone'', similar to a [[vapour cone]], with the aircraft at its tip.  The half-angle between direction of flight and the shock wave &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin( \alpha) =\frac{v_\text{sound}}{v_\text{object}} &lt;/math&gt;,

where  &lt;math&gt; \frac{v_\text{sound}}{v_\text{object}} &lt;/math&gt; is the inverse &lt;math&gt;\Big(\frac{1}{Ma}\Big)&lt;/math&gt; of the plane's [[Mach number]] (&lt;math&gt;Ma = \frac{v_\text{object}}{v_\text{sound}}&lt;/math&gt;).  Thus the faster the plane travels, the finer and more pointed the cone is.

There is a rise in pressure at the nose, decreasing steadily to a negative pressure at the tail, followed by a sudden return to normal pressure after the object passes. This "[[overpressure]] profile" is known as an N-wave because of its shape. The "boom" is experienced when there is a sudden change in pressure; therefore, an N-wave causes two booms – one when the initial pressure-rise reaches an observer, and another when the pressure returns to normal. This leads to a distinctive "double boom" from a supersonic aircraft. When the aircraft is maneuvering, the pressure distribution changes into different forms, with a characteristic U-wave shape.

Since the boom is being generated continually as long as the aircraft is supersonic, it fills out a narrow path on the ground following the aircraft's flight path, a bit like an unrolling [[red carpet]], and hence known as the ''boom carpet''.  Its width depends on the altitude of the aircraft. The distance from the point on the ground where the boom is heard to the aircraft depends on its altitude and the angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha &lt;/math&gt;.

For today's supersonic aircraft in normal operating conditions, the peak overpressure varies from less than 50 to 500 [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] (1 to 10 psf (pound per square foot)) for an N-wave boom. Peak [[overpressure]]s for U-waves are amplified two to five times the N-wave, but this amplified overpressure impacts only a very small area when compared to the area exposed to the rest of the sonic boom. The strongest sonic boom ever recorded was 7,000 Pa (144 psf) and it did not cause injury to the researchers who were exposed to it. The boom was produced by an [[F-4 Phantom II|F-4]] flying just above the speed of sound at an altitude of {{convert|100|ft|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://proceedings.esri.com/library/userconf/proc01/professional/papers/pap284/p284.htm Analyzing Sonic Boom Footprints of Military Jets, Andy S. Rogers, A.O.T, Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent tests, the maximum boom measured during more realistic flight conditions was 1,010 Pa (21 psf). There is a probability that some damage — shattered glass, for example — will result from a sonic boom. Buildings in good condition should suffer no damage by pressures of 530 Pa (11 psf) or less. And, typically, community exposure to sonic boom is below 100 Pa (2 psf). Ground motion resulting from sonic boom is rare and is well below structural damage thresholds accepted by the [[U.S. Bureau of Mines]] and other agencies.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;USAF Fact Sheet 96-03, Armstrong Laboratory, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The power, or volume, of the shock wave depends on the quantity of air that is being accelerated, and thus the size and shape of the aircraft. As the aircraft increases speed the shock cone gets ''tighter'' around the craft and becomes weaker to the point that at very high speeds and altitudes no boom is heard.  The "length" of the boom from front to back depends on the length of the aircraft to a power of 3/2. Longer aircraft therefore "spread out" their booms more than smaller ones, which leads to a less powerful boom.&lt;ref name=seebass&gt;[ftp://ftp.rta.nato.int/PubFulltext/RTO/EN/RTO-EN-004/$EN-004-06.pdf Sonic Boom Minimization Richard Seebass]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several smaller shock waves can and usually do form at other points on the aircraft, primarily at any convex points, or curves, the leading wing edge, and especially the inlet to engines. These secondary shockwaves are caused by the air being forced to turn around these convex points, which generates a shock wave in [[Supersonic speed|supersonic flow]].

The later shock waves are somewhat faster than the first one, travel faster and add to the main shockwave at some distance away from the aircraft to create a much more defined N-wave shape. This maximizes both the magnitude and the "rise time" of the shock which makes the boom seem louder. On most aircraft designs the characteristic distance is about {{convert|40000|ft|m|sigfig=2}}, meaning that below this altitude the sonic boom will be "softer". However, the drag at this altitude or below makes supersonic travel particularly inefficient, which poses a serious problem.

==Measurement and examples==
The [[pressure]] from sonic booms caused by aircraft often are a few pounds per square foot. A vehicle flying at greater altitude will generate lower pressures on the ground, because the shock wave reduces in intensity as it spreads out away from the vehicle, but the sonic booms are less affected by vehicle speed.

==Abatement==
[[File:Large-Scale Low-Boom Supersonic Inlet Model.jpg|thumb|New research is being performed at NASA's [[Glenn Research Center]] that could help alleviate the sonic boom produced by supersonic aircraft. Testing was recently completed of a Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model with micro-array flow control. A NASA aerospace engineer is pictured here in a wind tunnel with the Large-Scale Low-Boom supersonic inlet model.]]

In the late 1950s when [[supersonic transport]] (SST) designs were being actively pursued, it was thought that although the boom would be very large, the problems could be avoided by flying higher. This assumption was proven false when the [[North American B-70]] ''Valkyrie'' started flying, and it was found that the boom was a problem even at 70,000 feet (21,000&amp;nbsp;m). It was during these tests that the N-wave was first characterized.

Richard Seebass and his colleague Albert George at [[Cornell University]] studied the problem extensively and eventually defined a "[[figure of merit]]" (FM) to characterize the sonic boom levels of different aircraft. FM is a function of the aircraft weight and the aircraft length. The lower this value, the less boom the aircraft generates, with figures of about 1 or lower being considered acceptable. Using this calculation, they found FMs of about 1.4 for [[Concorde]] and 1.9 for the [[Boeing 2707]]. This eventually doomed most SST projects as public resentment mixed with politics eventually resulted in laws that made any such aircraft impractical (flying supersonically only over water for instance). Another way to express this is [[wing span]]. The [[fuselage]] of even a large supersonic aircraft is very sleek and with enough angle of attack and wing span the plane can fly so high that the boom by the fuselage is not important. The larger the wing span, the greater the downwards impulse which can be applied to the air, the greater the boom felt. A smaller wing span favors small aeroplane designs like [[business jets]].&lt;ref name=seebass/&gt;

Seebass and George also worked on the problem from a different angle, trying to spread out the N-wave laterally and temporally (longitudinally), by producing a strong and downwards-focused ([[SR-71 Blackbird]], [[Boeing X-43]]) shock at a sharp, but wide angle nosecone, which will travel at slightly supersonic speed ([[Shock wave|bow shock]]), and using a swept back [[flying wing]] or an [[Oblique wing|oblique flying wing]] to smooth out this shock along the direction of flight (the tail of the shock travels at sonic speed). To adapt this principle to existing planes, which generate a shock at their [[nose cone]] and an even stronger one at their wing leading edge, the fuselage below the wing is shaped according to the [[area rule]]. Ideally this would raise the characteristic altitude from {{convert|40000|ft|m}} to 60,000 feet (from 12,000&amp;nbsp;m to 18,000&amp;nbsp;m), which is where most SST aircraft were expected to fly.&lt;ref name=seebass/&gt;

[[File:Northrop F-5E (modified) DARPA sonic tests 04.07R.jpg|thumb|NASA F-5E modified for DARPA sonic boom tests]]
This remained untested for decades, until [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency|DARPA]] started the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration|Quiet Supersonic Platform]] project and funded the [[Shaped Sonic Boom Demonstration]] (SSBD) aircraft to test it. SSBD used an [[F-5 Freedom Fighter]].  The F-5E was modified with a highly refined shape which lengthened the nose to that of the F-5F model.  The [[aircraft fairing|fairing]] extended from the nose all the way back to the inlets on the underside of the aircraft.  The SSBD was tested over a two-year period culminating in 21 flights and was an extensive study on sonic boom characteristics. After measuring the 1,300 recordings, some taken inside the shock wave by a [[chase plane]], the SSBD demonstrated a reduction in boom by about one-third. Although one-third is not a huge reduction, it could have reduced Concorde's boom to an acceptable level; one below the FM&amp;nbsp;= 1 limit stated above, for instance.

As a follow-on to SSBD, in 2006 a [[NASA]]-[[Gulfstream Aerospace]] team tested the [[Quiet Spike]] on NASA-Dryden's F-15B aircraft 836.  The [[Quiet Spike]] is a telescoping boom fitted to the nose of an aircraft specifically designed to weaken the strength of the shock waves forming on the nose of the aircraft at supersonic speeds. Over 50 test flights were performed.  Several flights included probing of the shockwaves by a second F-15B, NASA's [[Intelligent Flight Control System]] testbed, aircraft 837.

There are theoretical designs that do not appear to create sonic booms at all, such as the [[Busemann's Biplane]]. However, creating a shockwave is inescapable if they generate aerodynamic lift.&lt;ref name=seebass/&gt;

NASA and [[Lockheed Martin]] Aeronautics Co. are working together to build an experimental aircraft called the [[Low Boom Flight Demonstrator]] (LBFD), which will reduce the sonic boom synonymous with high-speed flight to the sound of a car door closing. The agency has awarded a $247.5 million contract to construct a working version of the sleek, single-pilot plane by summer 2021 and should begin testing over the following years to determine whether the design could eventually be adapted to commercial aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

==Perception, noise and other concerns==
The sound of a sonic boom depends largely on the distance between the observer and the aircraft shape producing the sonic boom. A sonic boom is usually heard as a deep double "boom" as the aircraft is usually some distance away. However, as those who have witnessed landings of [[space shuttle]]s have heard, when the aircraft is nearby the sonic boom is a sharper "bang" or "crack". The sound is much like that of [[Mortar (weapon)|mortar bombs]], commonly used in [[firework display]]s. It is a common misconception that only one boom is generated during the subsonic to supersonic transition; rather, the boom is continuous along the boom carpet for the entire supersonic flight. As a former Concorde pilot puts it, "You don't actually hear anything on board. All we see is the pressure wave moving down the aeroplane - it gives an indication on the instruments. And that's what we see around Mach 1. But we don't hear the sonic boom or anything like that. That's rather like the wake of a ship - it's behind us.".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/3207470.stm BBC News interview with former Concorde Pilot (2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, NASA and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] began the [[Oklahoma City sonic boom tests]], which caused eight sonic booms per day over a period of six months. Valuable data was gathered from the experiment, but 15,000 complaints were generated and ultimately entangled the government in a [[class action]] lawsuit, which it lost on appeal in 1969.

Sonic booms were also a nuisance in North Cornwall and North Devon in the UK as these areas were underneath the flight path of Concorde. Windows would rattle and in some cases the "torching" (pointing underneath roof slates) would be dislodged with the vibration.

There has been recent work in this area, notably under DARPA's Quiet Supersonic Platform studies.  Research by acoustics experts under this program began looking more closely at the composition of sonic booms, including the frequency content.  Several characteristics of the traditional sonic boom "N" wave can influence how loud and irritating it can be perceived by listeners on the ground.  Even strong N-waves such as those generated by Concorde or military aircraft can be far less objectionable if the rise time of the overpressure is sufficiently long.  A new metric has emerged, known as ''perceived'' loudness, measured in PLdB.  This takes into account the frequency content, rise time, etc.  A well-known example is the snapping of one's fingers in which the "perceived" sound is nothing more than an annoyance.

The energy range of sonic boom is concentrated in the 0.1–100 [[hertz]] [[frequency range]] that is considerably below that of subsonic aircraft, [[Gunshot|gunfire]] and most [[industrial noise]]. Duration of sonic boom is brief; less than a second, 100 milliseconds (0.1 second) for most fighter-sized aircraft and 500 milliseconds for the space shuttle or Concorde jetliner. The intensity and width of a sonic boom path depends on the physical characteristics of the aircraft and how it is operated. In general, the greater an aircraft's altitude, the lower the overpressure on the ground. Greater altitude also increases the boom's lateral spread, exposing a wider area to the boom. Overpressures in the sonic boom impact area, however, will not be uniform. Boom intensity is greatest directly under the flight path, progressively weakening with greater horizontal distance away from the aircraft flight track.  Ground width of the boom exposure area is approximately {{convert|1|smi|km}} for each {{convert|1000|ft|m}} of altitude (the width is about five times the altitude); that is, an aircraft flying supersonic at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} will create a lateral boom spread of about {{convert|30|mi|km}}. For steady supersonic flight, the boom is described as a carpet boom since it moves with the aircraft as it maintains supersonic speed and altitude. Some manoeuvers, diving, acceleration or turning, can cause focusing of the boom. Other manoeuvers, such as deceleration and climbing, can reduce the strength of the shock. In some instances weather conditions can distort sonic booms.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

Depending on the aircraft's altitude, sonic booms reach the ground two to 60 seconds after flyover. However, not all booms are heard at ground level. The speed of sound at any altitude is a function of air temperature. A decrease or increase in temperature results in a corresponding decrease or increase in sound speed. Under standard atmospheric conditions, air temperature decreases with increased altitude. For example, when sea-level temperature is 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15&amp;nbsp;°C), the temperature at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} drops to minus 49 degrees Fahrenheit (−45&amp;nbsp;°C). This temperature gradient helps bend the sound waves upward. Therefore, for a boom to reach the ground, the aircraft speed relative to the ground must be greater than the speed of sound at the ground. For example, the speed of sound at {{convert|30000|ft|m}} is about {{convert|670|mph|km/h}}, but an aircraft must travel at least {{convert|750|mph|km/h}} (Mach 1.12, where Mach 1 equals the speed of sound) for a boom to be heard on the ground.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet" /&gt;

The composition of the atmosphere is also a factor.  Temperature variations, [[humidity]], [[atmospheric pollution]], and [[wind]]s can all have an effect on how a sonic boom is perceived on the ground.  Even the ground itself can influence the sound of a sonic boom.  Hard surfaces such as [[concrete]], [[Road surface|pavement]], and large buildings can cause reflections which may amplify the sound of a sonic boom.  Similarly [[grass]]y fields and lots of [[foliage]] can help attenuate the strength of the overpressure of a sonic boom.

Currently there are no industry accepted standards for the acceptability of a sonic boom.  Until such metrics can be established, either through further study or supersonic overflight testing, it is doubtful that legislation will be enacted to remove the current prohibition on supersonic overflight in place in several countries, including the United States.

==Bullwhip==
[[File:Bullwhip.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An Australian bullwhip.]]
The cracking sound a [[bullwhip]] makes when properly wielded is, in fact, a small sonic boom. The end of the whip, known as the ''"cracker"'', moves faster than the speed of sound, thus creating a sonic boom.&lt;ref name="americanscientist.org"/&gt; The whip is probably the first human invention to break the [[sound barrier]].{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

A bullwhip tapers down from the handle section to the cracker. The cracker has much less mass than the handle section. When the whip is sharply swung, the energy is transferred down the length of the tapering whip.  Goriely and McMillen showed that the physical explanation is complex, involving the way that a loop travels down a tapered filament under tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Alain Goriely and Tyler McMillen | title = Shape of a Cracking Whip | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 88 | issue = 12 | year = 2002 | pages = 244301-1–244301-4 | url = http://www.e-kaczor.net/keiko/whip.pdf|doi=10.1103/physrevlett.88.244301 |bibcode = 2002PhRvL..88x4301G | pmid=12059302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''resource starvation''' is a problem encountered in [[concurrent computing]] where a [[computer process|process]] is perpetually denied necessary [[Resource (computer science)|resources]] to process its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Operating Systems |last=Tanenbaum |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Tanenbaum |year=2001 |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-092641-8 |pages=184–185 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starvation may be caused by errors in a scheduling or [[mutual exclusion]] algorithm, but can also be caused by [[resource leak]]s, and can be intentionally caused via a [[denial-of-service attack]] such as a [[fork bomb]].

When starvation is impossible in a [[concurrent algorithm]], the algorithm is called '''starvation-free''', '''lockout-freed'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Art of Multiprocessor Programming |first1=Maurice |last1=Herlihy |authorlink1=Maurice Herlihy |first2=Nir |last2=Shavit |authorlink2=Nir Shavit |publisher=Elsevier |year=2012 |page=24 |isbn=9780123977953}}&lt;/ref&gt; or said to have '''finite bypass'''.{{r|raynal}} This property is an instance of [[liveness]], and is one of the two requirements for any mutual exclusion algorithm; the other being [[Correctness (computer science)|correctness]]. The name "finite bypass" means that any process (concurrent part) of the algorithm is bypassed at most a finite number times before being allowed access to the [[shared resource]].&lt;ref name="raynal"&gt;{{cite book |title=Concurrent Programming: Algorithms, Principles, and Foundations |first=Michel |last=Raynal |authorlink=Michel Raynal |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |year=2012 |isbn=3642320279 |page=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scheduling==
Starvation is usually caused by an overly simplistic [[scheduling algorithm]]. For example, if a (poorly designed) multi-tasking system always switches between the first two tasks while a third never gets to run, then the third task is being starved of [[CPU time]]. The scheduling algorithm, which is part of the [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]], is supposed to allocate resources equitably; that is, the algorithm should allocate resources so that no process perpetually lacks necessary resources.

Many operating system schedulers employ the concept of process priority. A high priority process A will run before a low priority process B. If the high priority process (process A) blocks and never yields, the low priority process (B) will (in some systems) never be scheduled—it will experience starvation. If there is an even higher priority process X, which is dependent on a result from process B, then process X might never finish, even though it is the most important process in the system. This condition is called a [[priority inversion]].  Modern scheduling algorithms normally contain code to guarantee that all processes will receive a minimum amount of each important resource (most often CPU time) in order to prevent any process from being subjected to starvation.

In computer networks, especially wireless networks, [[scheduling algorithm]]s may suffer from scheduling starvation. An example is [[maximum throughput scheduling]].

Starvation is normally caused by [[deadlock]] in that it causes a process to freeze. Two or more processes become deadlocked when each of them is doing nothing while waiting for a resource occupied by another program in the same set. On the other hand, a process is in starvation when it is waiting for a resource that is continuously given to other processes. Starvation-freedom is a stronger guarantee than the absence of deadlock: a mutual exclusion algorithm that must choose to allow one of two processes into a [[critical section]] and picks one arbitrarily is deadlock-free, but not starvation-free.{{r|raynal}}

A possible solution to starvation is to use a scheduling algorithm with priority queue that also uses the [[Aging (scheduling)|aging]] technique. Aging is a technique of gradually increasing the priority of processes that wait in the system for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;

The '''theory of indispensable attributes''' ('''TIA''') is a theory in the context of [[perceptual organization|perceptual organisation]] which asks for the functional units and elementary features that are relevant for a [[perceptual system]] in the constitution of perceptual objects. Earlier versions of the theory emerged in the context of an application of research on [[Visual system|vision]] to [[Auditory system|audition]], and analogies between vision and audition were emphasised,&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael: Concurrent-Pitch Segregation and the Theory of Indispensable Attributes. In: Kubovy, Michael/Pomeranz, James R. (Eds.): Perceptual Organization, Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1981, 55–98.&lt;/ref&gt;
whereas in more recent writings the necessity of a [[Sensory modality|modality-general]] theory of perceptual organisation and objecthood is stressed.&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael/Valkenburg, D. Van: ''In defense of the theory of indispensable attributes.'' Cognition 87, 2003, pp. 225–233, here: p. 226.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject of perceptual organisation, and with it TIA, constitute a prime example of how theories of [[Gestalt psychology]]  have been taken up and kept alive in [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kubovy, Michael (1999): ''Gestalt Psychology''. In: Robert A. Wilson/Frank C. Keil (Eds.), The MIT Encyclopedia of the Cognitive Sciences, pp. 346–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

TIA has been drawn on in the context of music research, in the areas of music philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Charles O. (2007): ''The Musical Representation. Meaning, Ontology, and Emotion'', Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;
and systematic music theory.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Schmidt, Lüder/Schmidt, Silke/Seifert, Uwe/Gernemann, Andreas: ''Perceptual Organization and Systematic Music Theory: Musical Surface, Auditory Objects, and the Theory of Indispensable Attributes.'' In: Proceedings of the APSCOM Conference Seoul 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Perceptual grouping ==
Since the [[perception]] of objects implies a segregation of some parts of the environment (''figure'') from other parts of the environment (''ground''), a [[perceptual system]] will have to rely on certain features in the environment for the aggregation of what goes together. This aggregation is termed [[Principles of grouping|''perceptual grouping'' (PG)]], and the aim of TIA is the identification of conditions for the occurrence of PG.&lt;ref name="kubovy227"&gt;Kubovy, M./Valkenburg, D. Van: "In defense of the theory of indispensable attributes." ''Cognition'' 87, 2003, pp. 225–233, here: p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

PG is considered as a transformation happening between some input and some output. The input &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; is considered a set of discrete elements which are distributed over some medium &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. Media are also termed ''indispensable attributes'' (IA). The output PP is termed a ''phenomenal partition'' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; into subsets, or ''blocks'', E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., E&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="kubovy227" /&gt;

The grouping into some block E&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; occurs in reference to at least one feature F&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; from a set of features &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Kubovy and Van Valkenburg (2003) recommend the following expression for the description of a PP: "... the elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{E}&lt;/math&gt; spread over &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, are grouped by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;."&lt;ref name="kubovy227" /&gt;

'''Enno Friedrich Wichard Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff''' (22 December 1848 &amp;ndash; 25 September 1931) was a German [[Classical philology|classical philologist]]. Wilamowitz, as he is known in scholarly circles, was a renowned authority on [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|its literature]].

== Life ==

=== Youth ===
Wilamowitz-Moellendorff was born in [[Markowice, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Markowitz (Markowice)]], a small village near [[Inowrocław|Hohensalza (Inowrocław)]], in the then [[Province of Posen]] (now part of the [[Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship]]), to a [[Germanization|Germanized]] family of distant [[Poles|Polish]] ancestry. His father, a [[Prussian Junker]], was Arnold Wilamowitz, of [[Szlachta]] origin and using the [[Ogończyk coat of arms]], while his mother was Ulrika, née Calbo. The couple settled in a small manor confiscated from a local noble in 1836. The Prussian part of their name, von Moellendorf, was acquired in 1813, when Prussian field marshal [[Wichard Joachim Heinrich von Möllendorf]] adopted Ulrich's ancestors. Wilamowitz, a third child, grew up in [[East Prussia]].

In 1867 Wilamowitz passed his ''[[Abitur]]'' at the renowned boarding school at [[Schulpforta]].

=== Studies ===
Until 1869 Wilamowitz studied [[Classical Philology]] at the [[University of Bonn]]. His teachers, [[Otto Jahn]] and [[Hermann Usener]], had a formative influence on him. Willamowitz's relationship with Usener was strained. He developed a lifelong rivalry with his fellow student [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and a close friendship with his contemporary [[Hermann Diels]]. Together with Diels, he moved to [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] in 1869, where he graduated as a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] [[cum laude]] in 1870. After voluntary service in the [[Franco-Prussian War]], he embarked on a study tour to Italy and Greece.

=== Conflict with Nietzsche and Wagner ===
Even before he gained a professorial title, Wilamowitz was a member of a scholarly dispute about Nietzsche's ''[[Birth of Tragedy]]'' that attracted much attention. In 1872–73, he published two unusually aggressive polemics ([[German language|German]]: ''"Zukunftsphilologie"'', i.e. ''"Philology of the future"''), which strongly attacked Nietzsche (then Professor at the [[University of Basel]]) and Professor [[Erwin Rohde]] ([[University of Kiel]]). [[Richard Wagner]], whose views on art had influenced Nietzsche and Rohde, reacted by publishing an [[open letter]] and Rohde wrote a damning response. The issue at stake was the deprecation of [[Euripides]], on whom Nietzsche blamed the destruction of [[Greek tragedy]]. Wilamowitz saw the methods of his adversaries as an attack on the basic tenets of scientific thought, unmasking them as enemies of the [[scientific method]]. His polemic was considered as Classical philology's reply to Nietzsche's challenge.&lt;ref&gt;M. S. Silk &amp; [[J. P. Stern]], ''Nietzsche on Tragedy'', Cambridge University Press, 1981 pp.90-106&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 80 when Wilamowitz wrote his memoirs, he saw the conflict with Nietzsche less passionately, but did not retract the essential points of his critique. He stated that he had not fully realised at the time that Nietzsche was not interested in scientific understanding but rather in Wagner's musical drama, but also that he was nevertheless right to take his position against Nietzsche's "rape of historical facts and all [[historical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;Wilt Aden Schröder: "Fünf Briefe des Verlegers Eduard Eggers an Wilamowitz, betreffend die Zukunftsphilologie! und die Analecta Euripidea", in: ''Eikasmos'' '''12''' (2001:367-383) p. 373f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greifswald ===
[[File:Wilamowitz Young.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Wilamowitz in Greifswald (1878)]]
In 1875, he gained a professorial title for his study ''Analecta Euripidea''. In the same year he gave his first public academic lecture in Berlin. In 1876, he was employed as ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) for Classical Philology at [[University of Greifswald|Ernst-Moritz-Arndt-Universität]] at [[Greifswald]]. During this period, he also married Marie Mommsen, the eldest daughter of [[Theodor Mommsen]], and published ''Homeric Studies'' (''Homerische Studien'').

=== Göttingen ===
In 1883, he took a further professorial position at [[Göttingen University|Georg-August-Universität]] in [[Göttingen]]. Here, he continued to teach Classical Philology but also gave replacement lectures in [[Ancient History]]. His influence ensured the employment of his Greifswald colleague, [[Julius Wellhausen]], in Göttingen. In 1891, he became vice-chancellor of the university, and he was appointed a member of Göttingen's Royal Academy of Sciences one year later. When Wilamowitz left Göttingen, he was succeeded by [[Georg Kaibel]], a close associate from his student days and his successor at Greifswald.

=== Berlin ===
In 1897, with the support of his friend Diels, Wilamowitz was offered a position at the Royal [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] at Berlin, as successor to [[Ernst Curtius]]. He stayed until his retirement in 1921. In 1915, he was appointed chancellor of the university for one year. Together with Diels, he founded the Berlin Institute for Ancient Studies (''Institut für Altertumskunde'') in 1897. His public lectures on subjects of [[Classical antiquity]], which took place twice a week, attracted large audiences.

=== Teaching activities and memberships ===
In 1891, Wilamowitz was elected a corresponding member of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] and he was a full member from 1899. In 1902 he took the academy's presidency. As a member of the Göttingen academy, he strongly encouraged the publication of the ''[[Thesaurus Linguae Latinae]]''. From 1897 he also worked as a member to the academy's Commission for [[Patristics]]. In 1894 he was elected full member of the [[German Archaeological Institute]]. He also was editor of the series ''Philologische Untersuchungen'' from 1880 to 1925.

Further, Wilamowitz taught as a guest lecturer in [[Oxford]] (1908) and [[Uppsala]] (1912), was a corresponding member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]] (1909) and the Scientific Society of [[Lund]] (1921).

===''Inscriptiones Graecae''===
During his presidency of the Prussian Academy, Wilamowitz oversaw the continuation of [[August Böckh]]'s and [[Adolf Kirchhoff]]'s publication series, the ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]''. Wilamowitz had a formative influence on the further development of that project, which he directed until his death.

=== World War I ===
Wilamowitz was an initiator of the memorandum ''Erklärung der Hochschullehrer des Deutschen Reiches'' ("Declaration by the University Teachers of the German Reich"), in which 3,016 signatories supported German participation in the First World War. Shortly after, he also signed the ''[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]]'', from which he distanced himself later. In 1914, his son, Tycho von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, who was also active as a classical philologist, fell in the battle of [[Dęblin|Ivangorod]]. The memorandum appeared a few days later.

=== Family ===
In 1878 he married Maria Mommsen, the eldest daughter of the famous [[ancient historian]], [[Theodor Mommsen]], whom he actively assisted in the completion of his ''Roman History''.

Wilamowitz spent his last years in seclusion, suffering from severe kidney problems. He died in Berlin on 25 September 1931, having been in a coma for a short time. He is buried in his native village, along with his wife, Maria (1855–1936), and their only son, Tycho. He also had a daughter, Dorothea Freifrau Hiller von Gaertringen, wife of archaeologist [[Friedrich Hiller von Gaertringen]], who died on 24 March 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UGv24_aqFs0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=el#PPA92,M1 Greek Literature: Greek literature in the classical period]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Achievements ==
Wilamowitz is one of the central figures of 19th and 20th century Classical philology. As a great authority of the literature and history of [[Ancient Greece]], Wilamowitz took a stance against traditional methodology and [[textual criticism]]. As a representative of Postclassicism, he concentrated less on [[literary history]] but rather aimed to extract biographical information on the respective authors from the preserved texts. Thus, he employed historical perspectives to serve philology. Apart from his seminal general works (''Greek Literature from Antiquity'', ''Hellenistic Poetry''), he published numerous detailed studies of [[Euripides]], [[Homer]], [[Aeschylus]], [[Pindar]] and [[Aristotle]]. As a scientific organiser, he was also responsible for the publication of important standard-setting source material publications, such as ''[[Inscriptiones Graecae]]''.

He also passionately supported the preservation of Classical education in the German school system.

Notable pupils of his include [[Felix Jacoby]], [[Karl Mittelhaus]], [[Wolfgang Schadewaldt]], [[Eduard Fraenkel]], [[Werner Jaeger]], [[Johannes Geffcken]], [[Paul Maas (classical scholar)|Paul Maas]], [[Eduard Schwartz]], [[Gilbert Murray]], [[Paul Friedländer (philologist)|Paul Friedländer]], [[Friedrich Solmsen]] and [[Johannes Sykutris]].

In recent decades, the American scholar [[William M. Calder III]] has been publishing a series of important documents about and by Wilamowitz, including much of his correspondence with Diels, [[Eduard Norden]], [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]], [[Paul Wendland]], and others.

A '''zoophyte''' is an [[animal]] that visually resembles a [[plant]]. An example is a [[sea anemone]]. The name is obsolete in modern science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chambers 20th Century Dictionary|editor=Kirkpatrick, E. M.|publisher=Chambers|location=Edinburgh|year=1983|pages=1524}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Western history ==

Zoophytes are common in medieval and renaissance era [[herbal]]s, notable examples including the [[Vegetable Lamb of Tartary|Tartar Lamb]], a plant which grew sheep as fruit.&lt;ref name=royalsociety&gt;{{cite journal |last=Appleby |first=John H. |title=The Royal Society and the Tartar Lamb |journal=Notes and Records of the Royal Society |year=1997 |jstor=532033 |doi=10.1098/rsnr.1997.0003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoophytes appeared in many influential early medical texts, such as [[Pedanius Dioscorides|Dioscorides's]] ''[[De Materia Medica]]'' and subsequent adaptations and commentaries on that work, notably [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli|Mattioli's]] ''Discorsi''. Zoophytes are frequently seen as medieval attempts to explain the origins of exotic, unknown plants with strange properties (such as [[cotton]], in the case of the Tartar Lamb).&lt;ref name="Large&amp;Braggins" &gt;{{cite book | last=Large | first=Mark F. |author2=John E. Braggins  | title=Tree Ferns | publisher=Timber Press | year=2004 | location=Portland, Oregon | page=360 | isbn=978-0-88192-630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports of zoophytes continued into the seventeenth century and were commented on by many influential thinkers of the time period, including [[Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref name=royalsociety /&gt; It was not until 1646 that claims of zoophytes began to be concretely refuted, and skepticism towards claims of zoophytes mounted throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref name=royalsociety /&gt; However, the term was still used by [[Georges Cuvier]] in his ''[[Le Règne Animal]]'' in 1817, as the title of one of his four divisions (''Embranchements'') of the animal kingdom (called [[Radiata]] in English translations), and by Charles Darwin in his book ''[[The Voyage of the Beagle]]'' in 1845.

== Other cultures ==

In the Eastern cultures such as [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]] fungi were classified as plants in the [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] texts, and [[cordyceps]], and in particular ''[[Ophiocordyceps sinensis]]'' were considered zoophytes.&lt;ref name="mm" &gt;{{Cite book | author = Halpern, Miller | title = Medicinal Mushrooms | pages = 64–65 | publisher = M. Evans and Company, Inc. | location = New York, New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-87131-981-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
