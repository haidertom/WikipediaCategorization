'''''A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction''''' is a 1977 book on [[architecture]], [[urban design]], and community [[livability]].  It was authored by [[Christopher Alexander]], [[Sara Ishikawa]] and [[Murray Silverstein]] of the [[Center for Environmental Structure]] of [[Berkeley, California]], with writing credits also to Max Jacobson, Ingrid Fiksdahl-King and Shlomo Angel. Decades after its publication, it is still one of the best-selling books on architecture.&lt;ref&gt;review: [http://www.katarxis3.com/Review_Nature_Order.htm Towards a New Science of Architecture, and a New Architecture of Science, KATARXIS No 3, London UK, September 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book creates a new language, what the authors call a [[pattern language]] derived from timeless entities called patterns. As they write on page xxxv of the introduction, "All 253 patterns together form a language." Patterns describe a problem and then offer a solution. In doing so the authors intend to give ordinary people, not only professionals, a way to work with their neighbors to improve a town or neighborhood, design a house for themselves or work with colleagues to design an office, workshop or public building such as a school.

== Structure ==
Written in the 1970s at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], ''A Pattern Language'' was influenced by the then-emerging language to describe computer programming and design. "A pattern language has the structure of a network," the authors write on page xviii. Thus, each pattern may have a statement that is referenced to another pattern by placing that pattern's number in brackets, for example: '''(12)''' means go to the ''Community of 7,000'' pattern. In this way, it is structured as a [[hypertext]].

It includes 253 patterns such as ''Community of 7000'' (Pattern 12) given a treatment over several pages; page 71 states: "Individuals have no effective voice in any community of more than 5,000–10,000 persons." It is written as a set of problems and documented solutions.

According to Alexander &amp; team, the work originated from an observation that {{quote|text=At the core […] is the idea that people should design for themselves their own houses, streets and communities. This idea […] comes simply from the observation that most of the wonderful places of the world were not made by architects but by the people. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=front bookflap}}

The book uses words to describe patterns, supported by drawings, photographs and charts. It describes exact methods for constructing practical, safe, and attractive designs at every scale, from entire regions, through cities, neighborhoods, gardens, buildings, rooms, built-in furniture, and fixtures down to the level of doorknobs. The patterns are regarded by the authors not as infallible, but as hypotheses: {{quote|text=[…] each pattern represents our current best guess as to what arrangement of the physical environment will work to solve the problem presented. The empirical questions center on the problem—does it occur and is it felt in the way we have described it?—and the solution—does the arrangement we propose in fact resolve the problem? And the asterisks represent our degree of faith in these hypotheses. But of course, no matter what the asterisks say, the patterns are still hypotheses, all 253 of them—and are therefore all tentative, all free to evolve under the impact of new experience and observation. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. xv}}

Some patterns focus on materials, noting that some ancient systems, such as concrete, when adapted by modern technology, may become one of the best future materials: {{quote|text=We believe that ultra-lightweight concrete is one of the most fundamental bulk materials of the future. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. 958}} Other patterns focus on life experiences such as the Street Cafe (Pattern 88):{{quote |text=The street cafe provides a unique setting, special to cities: a place where people can sit lazily, legitimately, be on view, and watch the world go by […]. Encourage local cafes to spring up in each neighborhood. Make them intimate places, with several rooms, open to a busy path, where people can sit with coffee or a drink and watch the world go by. Build the front of the cafe so that a set of tables stretch out of the cafe, right into the street. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. 437,439}}

When these patterns are taken together, the authors say, they begin to form a kind of language, each pattern forming a word or thought of a true language rather than being a prescriptive way to design or solve a problem. As the authors write on p xiii, "Each solution is stated in such a way that it gives the essential field of relationships needed to solve the problem, but in a very general and abstract way—so that you can solve the problem for yourself, in your own way, by adapting it to your preferences, and the local conditions at the place where you are making it."

A notable value is that the architectural system consists only of timeless patterns tested in the real world and reviewed by multiple architects for beauty and practicality. The patterns include provision for future modification and repair, in keeping with the principle that the most satisfying living spaces are those which, like the lives of their occupants, tend to change and evolve over time.

The book values human rights such as freedom, and it shows how architecture can enhance or reduce an individual's sense of freedom {{quote|text=[…] we are saying that a centralized entrance, which funnels everyone in a building through it, has in its nature the trappings of control; while the pattern of many open stairs, leading off the public streets, direct to private doors, has in its nature the fact of independence, free comings and goings. |author=Christopher Alexander et al. |title=''A Pattern Language'' |source=p. 742}}

== Reception ==
This book's method was adopted by the [[University of Oregon]], as described in ''[[The Oregon Experiment]]'', and remains the official planning instrument.&lt;ref name="UOCampusPlan"&gt;University of Oregon Campus Plan -- Principle 11: Patterns. {{citation|title=UO Campus Plan|year=2018|location=Eugene, Oregon|url=https://cpfm.uoregon.edu/campus-plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been adopted in part by some cities{{which|date=April 2014}} as a building code.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Alexander's conception of [[pattern]]s, and [[pattern language]]s, were major factors in the creation of [[Ward Cunningham]]'s [[WikiWikiWeb]], the first [[wiki]], which was intended as an archive and discussion web application for the [[Portland Pattern Repository]].&lt;ref name="artima"&gt;{{cite web |title=Exploring with Wiki: A Conversation with Ward Cunningham, Part I |author=Bill Venners |date=October 20, 2003 |url=http://www.artima.com/intv/wiki.html |publisher=artima developer |accessdate=December 12, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205091836/http://www.artima.com/intv/wiki.html |archivedate=February 5, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a [[pattern language]] appears to apply to many complex engineering tasks, and has been applied to some of them. It has been especially influential in [[software engineering]] where [[Software design pattern|design patterns]] have been used to document collective knowledge in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Berna L.

As with most forms of sexual activity, anal sex participants risk contracting [[sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs/STDs). Anal sex is considered a high-risk sexual practice because of the vulnerability of the anus and rectum. The anal and rectal tissues are delicate and do not provide lubrication like [[Vaginal lubrication|the vagina does]], so they can easily tear and permit disease transmission, especially if a [[personal lubricant]] is not used.&lt;ref name="WebMD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krasner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert I Krasner| title =The Microbial Challenge: Science, Disease and Public Health| publisher =[[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]]|year = 2010|pages=416–417|accessdate = August 28, 2013| isbn = 0763797359 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nThtlYxP84QC&amp;pg=PA416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anal sex without protection of a [[condom]] is considered the riskiest form of sexual activity,&lt;ref name="Krasner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hales"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Dianne Hales|title=An Invitation to Health Brief 2010-2011| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2008|accessdate=August 29, 2013|pages =269–271| isbn = 0495391921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oP91HVIMPRIC&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werner"&gt;{{cite book |author=Werner W.

Strong views are often expressed about anal sex. It is controversial in various cultures, especially with regard to [[religion and homosexuality|religious prohibitions]]. This is commonly due to prohibitions against anal sex among males or teachings about the [[Reproduction|procreative]] purpose of sexual activity.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery.com"/&gt; It may be regarded as [[taboo]] or unnatural, and is a [[Crime|criminal offense]] in some countries, punishable by [[Corporal punishment|corporal]] or [[capital punishment]].&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery.com"/&gt; By contrast, people also regard anal sex as a natural and valid form of sexual activity that may be as fulfilling as other desired sexual expressions. They may regard it as an enhancing element of their [[Sex life|sex lives]] or as their primary form of sexual activity.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Discovery.com"/&gt;

The abundance of [[Nerve|nerve endings]] in the anal region and [[rectum]] can make anal sex pleasurable for men or women.&lt;ref name="Answer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt; The [[Sphincter ani internus muscle|internal]] and [[Sphincter ani externus muscle|external]] [[sphincter]] muscles control the opening and closing of the anus; these muscles, which are sensitive membranes made up of many nerve endings, facilitate pleasure or pain during anal sex.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt; The ''Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia'' states that "the inner third of the anal canal is less sensitive to touch than the outer two-thirds, but is more sensitive to pressure" and that "the rectum is a curved tube about eight or nine inches long and has the capacity, like the anus, to expand".&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;

The anal sphincters are usually tighter than the [[pelvic floor|pelvic muscles]] of the vagina, which can enhance the sexual pleasure for the inserting male during male-to-female anal intercourse because of the pressure applied to the penis.&lt;ref name="WebMD"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt; Men may also enjoy the penetrative role during anal sex because of its association with dominance, because it is made more alluring by a female partner or society in general insisting that it is forbidden, or because it presents an additional option for penetration.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding"/&gt;

In a 2010 clinical review article of heterosexual anal sex, ''anal intercourse'' is used to specifically denote penile-anal penetration, and ''anal sex'' is used to denote any form of anal sexual activity. The review suggests that anal sex is exotic among the sexual practices of some heterosexuals and that "for a certain number of heterosexuals, anal intercourse is pleasurable, exciting, and perhaps considered more intimate than vaginal sex".&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;

Anal intercourse is sometimes used as a substitute for vaginal intercourse during [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt; The likelihood of [[pregnancy]] occurring&lt;!-- NOTE: This paragraph, including this line, relates to practice far more than it does to health, so it seemingly fits better here than in the Health risks section. --&gt; during anal sex is greatly reduced, as anal sex alone cannot lead to pregnancy unless sperm is somehow transported to the vaginal opening. Because of this, some couples practice anal intercourse as a form of [[Birth control|contraception]], often in the absence of a condom.&lt;ref name="LeRoy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Crooks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SIECUS ''Prevalence of Unprotected Anal Sex among Teens Requires New Education Strategies''[https://web.archive.org/web/20171231103438/http://www.sexedlibrary.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Feature.showFeature&amp;featureid=1036&amp;pageid=682&amp;parentid=478] Accessed January 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Male-to-female anal sex is commonly viewed as a way of preserving female [[virginity]] because it is non-procreative and does not tear the [[hymen]]; a person, especially a teenage girl or woman, who engages in anal sex or other sexual activity with no history of having engaged in vaginal intercourse is often regarded among heterosexuals and researchers as not having yet experienced virginity loss.

Carpenter stated that this view "dates to the late 1600s, with explicit 'rules' appearing around the turn of the twentieth century, as in marriage manuals defining petting as 'literally every caress known to married couples but does not include complete sexual intercourse.'"&lt;ref name="Carpenter"/&gt;

===Prevalence===

Because most research on anal intercourse addresses [[men who have sex with men]], little data exists on the prevalence of anal intercourse among heterosexual couples.&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coleman&gt;{{cite book |authors =Hardin L.K. Coleman, Christine Yeh|title =Handbook of School Counseling|isbn = 1135283591|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|page=247|accessdate=December 10, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBiPAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Kimberly R. McBride's 2010 clinical review on heterosexual anal intercourse and other forms of anal sexual activity, it is suggested that changing [[Norm (social)|norms]] may affect the frequency of heterosexual anal sex. McBride and her colleagues investigated the prevalence of non-intercourse anal sex behaviors among a sample of men (n=1,299) and women (n=1,919) compared to anal intercourse experience and found that 51% of men and 43% of women had participated in at least one act of oral–anal sex, manual–anal sex, or anal sex toy use.&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt; The report states the majority of men (n=631) and women (n=856) who reported heterosexual anal intercourse in the past 12 months were in exclusive, monogamous relationships: 69% and 73%, respectively.&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt; The review added that because "relatively little attention [is] given to anal intercourse and other anal sexual behaviors between heterosexual partners", this means that it is "quite rare" to have research "that specifically differentiates the anus as a sexual organ or addresses anal sexual function or dysfunction as legitimate topics. As a result, we do not know the extent to which anal intercourse differs qualitatively from coitus."&lt;ref name="McBride and Fortenberry"/&gt;

According to a 2010 study from the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) that was authored by [[Debby Herbenick]] et al., although anal intercourse is reported by fewer women than other partnered sex behaviors, partnered women in the age groups between 18–49 are significantly more likely to report having anal sex in the past 90 days. Women engaged in anal intercourse less commonly than men. Vaginal intercourse was practiced more than insertive anal intercourse among men, but 13% to 15% of men aged 25 to 49 practiced insertive anal intercourse.&lt;ref name="Carroll 2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Janell L.

''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'', Vol. 7, Supplement 5. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to adolescents, limited data also exists. This may be because of the taboo nature of anal sex and that teenagers and caregivers subsequently avoid talking to one another about the topic. It is also common for subject review panels and schools to avoid the subject.  A 2000 study found that 22.9% of college students who self-identified as non-virgins had anal sex.  They used condoms during anal sex 20.9% of the time as compared with 42.9% of the time with vaginal intercourse.&lt;ref name=Coleman/&gt;

Anal sex being more common among heterosexuals today than it was previously has been linked to the increase in consumption of anal pornography among men, especially among those who view it on a regular basis.&lt;ref name="Boyle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johansson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Seidman"&gt;{{cite book|title =Introducing the New Sexuality Studies|edition =2nd|author=Steven Seidman|author2=Nancy Fischer|author3=Chet Meeks|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2011|pages=108–112|isbn=1136818103|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rmjynItoEkC&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seidman et al. argued that "cheap, accessible and, especially, interactive media have enabled many more people to produce as well as consume pornography", and that this modern way of producing pornography, in addition to the buttocks and anus having become more eroticized, has led to a significant interest in or obsession with anal sex among men.&lt;ref name="Seidman"/&gt;

===Prevalence===

Reports regarding the prevalence of anal sex among gay men and other men who have sex with men vary. A survey in ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' in 1994 indicated that 46% of gay men preferred to penetrate their partners, while 43% preferred to be the receptive partner.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; Other sources suggest that roughly three-fourths of gay men have had anal sex at one time or another, with an equal percentage participating as tops and bottoms.&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt; A 2012 NSSHB sex survey in the U.S. suggests high lifetime participation in anal sex among gay men: 83.3% report ever taking part in anal sex in the insertive position and 90% in the receptive position, even if only between a third and a quarter self-report very recent engagement in the practice, defined as 30 days or less.&lt;ref name=dodge&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sexual Behaviors of U.S. Men by Self-Identified Sexual Orientation: Results From the 2012 National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior|author1=Brian Dodge|author2=et al.|year=2016|journal=J Sex Med|volume=13|pages=37e649|doi=10.1016/j.jsxm.2016.01.015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly, heterosexual men reject the idea of being receptive partners during anal sex because they believe it is a [[Femininity|feminine]] act, can make them vulnerable, or contradicts their sexual orientation (for example, that it is indicative that they are gay).&lt;ref name="Zdrok"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Odets"/&gt; The ''[[BMJ]]'' stated in 1999, however:&lt;blockquote&gt;There are little published data on how many heterosexual men would like their anus to be sexually stimulated in a heterosexual relationship. Anecdotally, it is a substantial number.

Although anal sex alone does not lead to pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with anal sex or other forms of sexual activity if the penis is near the vagina (such as during [[intercrural sex]] or other [[Sex position#Genital-genital rubbing|genital-genital rubbing]]) and its sperm is deposited near the vagina's entrance and travels along the vagina's lubricating fluids; the risk of pregnancy can also occur without the penis being near the vagina because sperm may be transported to the vaginal opening by the vagina coming in contact with fingers or other non-genital body parts that have come in contact with semen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=R.

Most cases of anal cancer are related to infection with the human papilloma virus (HPV). Anal sex alone does not cause anal cancer; the risk of anal cancer through anal sex is attributed to HPV infection, which is often contracted through unprotected anal sex.&lt;ref name="Anal cancer"/&gt; Anal cancer is relatively rare, and significantly less common than cancer of the colon or rectum ([[colorectal cancer]]); the [[American Cancer Society]] states that it affects approximately 7,060 people (4,430 in women and 2,630 in men) and results in approximately 880 deaths (550 in women and 330 in men) in the United States, and that, though anal cancer has been on the rise for many years, it is mainly diagnosed in adults, "with an average age being in the early 60s" and it "affects women somewhat more often than men."&lt;ref name="Anal cancer"/&gt; Though anal cancer is serious, treatment for it is "often very effective" and most anal cancer patients can be cured of the disease; the American Cancer Society adds that "receptive anal intercourse also increases the risk of anal cancer in both men and women, particularly in those younger than the age of 30. Because of this, men who have sex with men have a high risk of this cancer."&lt;ref name="Anal cancer"/&gt;

Seducing those not of proper age (for example, non-adolescent children) into the practice was considered very shameful for the adult, and having such relations with a male who was no longer adolescent was considered more shameful for the young male than for the one mounting him; Greek courtesans, or [[hetaera]]e, are said to have frequently practiced male-female anal intercourse as a means of preventing pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = James E.|year = 1995 | title = The Practices of Romans 1:26: Homosexual or Heterosexual? | url = | journal = Novum Testamentum | volume = 37 | issue = 1| page = 9 | quote = Heterosexual anal intercourse is best illustrated in Classical vase paintings of hetaerae with their clients, and some scholars interpret this as a form of contraception | doi=10.1163/1568536952613631}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A male citizen taking the passive (or receptive) role in anal intercourse (''paedicatio'' in [[Latin]]) was condemned in Rome as an act of ''impudicitia'' (immodesty or un[[chastity]]); free men, however, frequently took the active role with a young male slave, known as a ''[[catamite]]'' or ''puer delicatus''. The latter was allowed because anal intercourse was considered equivalent to vaginal intercourse in this way; men were said to "take it like a woman" (muliebria pati, "to undergo womanly things") when they were anally penetrated, but when a man performed anal sex on a woman, she was thought of as playing the boy's role.&lt;ref name="Skinner"&gt;{{cite book|title =Invading the Roman Body: Manliness and Impenetrability in Roman Thought.

In Japan, records (including detailed [[Shunga (art)|shunga]]) show that some males engaged in penetrative anal intercourse with males,&lt;ref name="Leupp"&gt;{{cite book|title =Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan|author=Gary P.

Therefore, the reverse of common practices was often portrayed. The [[Larco Museum]] houses an erotic gallery in which this pottery is showcased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museolarco.org/iep_er.shtml |title=Larco Museum - Lima Peru - Experience Ancient Peru - Permanent Exhibition :: |publisher=Museolarco.org |accessdate=2013-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304101359/http://www.museolarco.org/iep_er.shtml |archivedate=March 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th century anthropologist [[Richard Francis Burton]] theorized that there is a geographical [[Sotadic zone]] wherein penetrative intercourse between males is particularly prevalent and accepted; moreover he was one of the first writers to advance the premise that such an orientation is biologically determined.&lt;ref name="burton1885"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/pwh/burton-te.html |first=Sir Richard Francis |last=Burton|publisher=[[Fordham University]]|work="Terminal Essay", from his translation of The Arabian Nights |title=Section D: Pederasty |year=1885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western cultures===
In many western countries, anal sex has generally been taboo since the [[Middle Ages]], when [[heresy in Christianity|heretical]] movements were sometimes attacked by accusations that their members practiced anal sex among themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Good in Bed Guide to Anal Pleasuring |publisher=Good in Bed Guides|first=Debby |last=Herbenick |isbn=978-0-9843221-6-9 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, [[Celibacy|celibate]] members of the Christian clergy were accused of engaging in "[[Crime against nature|sins against nature]]", including anal sex.&lt;ref name="Aldrich, Wotherspoo"&gt;{{cite book|title =Who's Who in Gay and Lesbian History Vol.1: From Antiquity to the Mid-Twentieth Century|author=Robert Aldrich|author2=Garry Wotherspoo|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2002|page=116|isbn=020398675X|accessdate=December 22, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QweE7SzJH2UC&amp;pg=PA116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[buggery]]'' originated in [[medieval]] Europe as an insult used to describe the rumored same-sex sexual practices of the heretics from a sect originating in [[Bulgaria]], where its followers were called ''[[bogomilism|bogomils]]'';&lt;ref name="McKean"&gt;{{cite book |title= [[New Oxford American Dictionary]], 2nd edition |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |location= |isbn= 0-19-517077-6 |editor=Erin McKean}}&lt;/ref&gt; when they spread out of the country, they were called ''buggres'' (from the [[ethnonym]] ''Bulgars'').&lt;ref name="McKean"/&gt; Another term for the practice, more archaic, is ''pedicate'' from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''pedicare'', with the same meaning.&lt;ref name="Pollini"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pollini|first=John|title =The Warren Cup: Homoerotic Love and Symposial Rhetoric in Silver | journal = [[BJUI]] | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = 21–52 |date=March 1999 | doi = 10.1080/00043079.1999.10786870|quote="I have derived the word pedicate from the Latin paedicare or pedicare, meaning "to penetrate anally."

XII (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1980). passim, and especially Chapter VII, "Epilogue", pp. 515–538.&lt;/ref&gt; states "since a man’s wife is permitted to him, he may act with her in any manner whatsoever. He may have intercourse with her whenever he so desires and kiss any organ of her body he wishes, and he may have intercourse with her naturally or unnaturally [traditionally, ''unnaturally'' refers to anal and oral sex], provided that he does not expend semen to no purpose. Nevertheless, it is an attribute of piety that a man should not act in this matter with levity and that he should sanctify himself at the time of intercourse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mishneh Torah |first=Moshe |last=Maimonides |page=Laws Concerning Forbidden Relations 21:9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{Main|Islamic views on anal sex}}

''Liwat'', or the sin of [[Lot (biblical person)|Lot]]'s people, which has come to be interpreted as referring generally to same-sex sexual activity, is commonly officially prohibited by Islamic sects; there are parts of the [[Quran]] which talk about smiting on [[Sodom and Gomorrah]], and this is thought to be a reference to unnatural sex, and so there are [[hadith]] and Islamic laws which prohibit it.&lt;ref name="Leach"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark M Leach|title =Cultural Diversity and Suicide: Ethnic, Religious, Gender, and Sexual Orientation Perspectives|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2014|page=121|isbn=1317786599|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NqLrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; While, concerning Islamic belief, it is objectionable to use the words ''al-Liwat'' and ''luti'' to refer to homosexuality because it is [[blasphemy]] toward the prophet of [[Allah]], and therefore the terms ''sodomy'' and ''homosexuality'' are preferred,&lt;ref name="Bambale"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yahaya Yunusa Bambale|title =Crimes and Punishments Under Islamic Law|publisher=Malthouse Press Limited|origyear=2003 |year=2008|page=40|isbn=9780231595|accessdate=September 15, 2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PVGPAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; same-sex male practitioners of anal sex are called ''luti'' or ''lutiyin'' in plural and are seen as criminals in the same way that a thief is a criminal, meaning that they are giving in to a universal temptation.&lt;ref name="Bambale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conner"&gt;{{cite book|author=Randy P.

The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics is [[the Five Precepts]].  These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction.

====Hinduism====
{{See also|History of sex in India|LGBT topics and Hinduism}}

Although Hindu society does not formally acknowledge sexuality between men, it formally acknowledges and gives space to sexuality between men and [[third gender]]s as a variation of male-female sex (meaning a part of heterosexuality, rather than homosexuality, if analyzed in western terms). Hijras, Alis, Kotis, etc. (the various forms of third gender that exist in India today) are all characterized by the gender role of having receptive anal and oral sex with men. However, sexuality between males (as distinct from third genders) has thrived, mostly unspoken and informally, without being seen as different in the way it is seen in the west; young men involved in "such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;[http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0277953600001672 The social construction of male 'homosexuality' in India], by S Asthana and R. Oostvogels, published in 'Social Science &amp; Medicine', vol 52(2001), Quote: "Indian culture is highly homosocial and displays of affection, body contact and the sharing of beds between men is socially acceptable (Kahn, 1994) This creates opportunities for sexual contact, though sexual behavior in this context is rarely seen as real sex, but as play. Much of this same-sex sexual activity begins in adolescence between school friends and within family environments and is non-penetrative... Young men who cultivate such relationships do not consider themselves to be 'homosexual' but conceive their behavior in terms of sexual desire, opportunity and pleasure."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wiki-anilingus.png|thumb|Depiction of anilingus]]
'''Anilingus''' (from the Latin ''anus'' + ''-lingus'', from ''lingere'', "to lick", variantly  spelled "'''analingus'''",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Contemporary Dictionary of Sexual Euphemisms|author =Jordan Tate|year=2007|publisher=DSt. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-36298-6|pages=8–9, 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anal Pleasure &amp; Health: A Guide for Men and Women|author =Jack Morin|year=2000|publisher=Down There Press|isbn=0-940208-20-2|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]] act in which a person stimulates the [[human anus|anus]] of another by using the mouth, including lips, tongue, or teeth. It is also called '''anal–oral contact''' and '''anal–oral sex'''; colloquial names include '''rimming''' and '''rim job'''. It may be performed by and on persons of any [[sexual orientation]] for pleasure or as a form of [[erotic humiliation]]. Health risks include [[fecal–oral route|fecal–oral transmission]].
==Etymology==
The term ''anilingus'' entered English through the 1899 F. J. Rebman translation or Edition 10 of [[sexologist]] [[Richard von Krafft-Ebing]]'s 1886 book ''[[Psychopathia sexualis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Forsyth. ''The Etymologicon: A Circular Stroll through the Hidden Connections of the English Language''. Icon Books, 2011, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED|anilingus|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
===General===
Pleasure for the giver during anilingus is usually based more on the principle of the act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; The anus has a relatively high concentration of [[Nerve|nerve ending]]s and can be an [[erogenous zone]], and the receiver may receive pleasure from external anal stimulation. The person receiving anilingus is regarded as the passive partner in the act, and the person performing anilingus is the active partner. People may engage in anilingus for its own sake, before anal [[Fingering (sexual act)|fingering]] or penetration, or as part of [[foreplay]]. Studies indicate that anilingus is a rare [[Lesbian sexual practices|sexual practice between women]].&lt;ref name="Zenilman &amp; Shahmanesh"&gt;{{cite book | title = Sexually Transmitted Infections: Diagnosis, Management, and Treatment| publisher = [[Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers]] | year = 2011 | pages = 329–330 | accessdate = 14 May 2014 |isbn = 0495812943| url = https://books.google.com/?id=lO5BND02eBwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=|quote= |author1=Jonathan Zenilman |author2=Mohsen Shahmanesh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Diamant AL, Lever J, Schuster M |title=Lesbians' Sexual Activities and Efforts to Reduce Risks for Sexually Transmitted Diseases |journal=J Gay Lesbian Med Assoc. |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=41–8 |date=Jun 2000 |doi=10.1023/A:1009513623365 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technique===
Anilingus can involve a variety of techniques to stimulate the anus, including [[kissing]] or licking; it may also involve the tongue moving around the edge of the anus or up and down the insides of the cheeks of the [[buttock]]s, and in and out of the anus.

Anilingus can be performed in a number of [[sex position]]s including:

* the passive partner is on all fours in the [[doggy position]] with the active partner performing anilingus from behind.
* the passive partner is on their back in the [[missionary position]] with their legs raised high with the knees drawn towards their chest, and with some sort of support (such as a pillow) under their hips for comfort and to raise their buttocks. With the partner's anus exposed, the active partner kneels between the partner's legs to perform anilingus.

==Health risks and prevention==

===Health risk===
{{Main|Fecal–oral route}}
Anilingus has potential health risks arising from the oral contact with [[human feces]]. Diseases which may be transmitted by contact with feces include: bacterial diseases including [[shigellosis]] (bacillary dysentery); viral systemic diseases including [[hepatitis A]], [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], [[poliomyelitis]], [[human papillomavirus]] (HPV) and [[herpes simplex virus]]; parasites including [[intestinal parasite]]s; and infections and inflammations [[chlamydia infection]], [[gastroenteritis]], [[conjunctivitis]], [[gonorrhea]], [[lymphogranuloma venereum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lgbt.foundation/get-support/for-men/think-you-have-an-sti-/Lymphogranuloma-Venereum|title=Lymphogranuloma Venereum - LGBT Foundation|author =LGBT Foundation|date=|work=lgbt.foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Applying the mouth to the genitals immediately after applying it to the anus can introduce the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' ("''E. coli''") into the [[urethra]], leading to a [[urinary tract infection]]. [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] is not believed to be easily transmitted through anilingus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Anilingus with a number of casual partners increases the health risks associated with the practice. Generally, people carrying infections that may be passed on during anilingus appear healthy. [[Intestinal parasite|Parasites]] may be in the feces if undercooked meat was consumed. The feces contain traces of [[hepatitis A]] only if the infected person has eaten contaminated food.

Another recent study suggests a [[correlation]] between [[oral sex]] and [[Head and neck cancer|throat cancer]]. It is believed that this is due to the transmission of HPV because this virus has been implicated in most [[cervical cancer]]s. The study concludes that people who had one to five oral-sex partners in their lifetime had approximately a doubled risk of throat cancer compared with those who never engaged in this activity. Those with more than five oral-sex partners had a 250% increased risk compared with those who never engaged in this activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Prevention===
[[Safe sex]] practices may include thorough washing of the anal region before anilingus to wash away most external fecal particles and reduce the risk of contraction of fecal-sourced infection. An [[enema]] can also reduce the risk of direct fecal contact.&lt;ref name="Castleman"&gt;{{cite web |last = Castleman |first = Michael |date=27 April 2010 |title = Rimming: The curious couple's guide to oral-anal play  |publisher = ''Psychology Today'' |accessdate=23 November 2012 |url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201004/rimming-the-curious-couples-guide-oral-anal-play}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[dental dam]] may also be used, and another safe sex practice is to avoid unprotected sex which involves [[fellatio]] after anal intercourse.

If the receiving partner has wounds or open sores on the genitals, or if the giving partner has wounds or open sores on or in the mouth, or bleeding gums, this poses an increased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Brushing the teeth, flossing, undergoing dental work, and eating crunchy foods (such as potato chips) relatively soon before or after performing anilingus also increases the risk of transmission, because all of these activities can cause small scratches on the inside of the lips, cheeks, and palate. These wounds, even when they are [[Microscopic scale|microscopic]], increase the chances of contracting sexually transmitted infections that can be transmitted orally under these conditions.

==As punishment==
Forced and mostly public anilingus was used as a form of humiliation and punishment, usually of prisoners. The use of the practice in the [[Thirty Years' War]] was described by [[Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen|Grimmelshausen]] in ''[[Simplicius Simplicissimus]]'' (1668).&lt;ref&gt;''Simplicissimus, The German Adventurer'', trans. John C. Osborne, Newfound Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-9797292-5-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is commonly referred to as "arse licking", and the term is still at times applied to the behaviour of someone who is overly respectful or helpful to someone in authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/arse-licking|title=arse-licking definition and synonyms - Macmillan Dictionary|date=|work=macmillandictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Incarceration in the United States|United States prison system]], anilingus is one of the ways one prisoner pays his dues to another inmate. In [[prison slang]], this activity is known as "tossing a salad".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Byrne | first1 = J. | last2 = Hummer | first2 = D. | doi = 10.1016/j.avb.2007.02.001 | title = In search of the "Tossed Salad Man" (and others involved in prison violence): New strategies for predicting and controlling violence in prison | journal = Aggression and Violent Behavior | volume = 12 | issue = 5 | pages = 531 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marc Levin]] for HBO (1996).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1715">'''Animal symbolicum''' ("symbol-making" or "symbolizing animal") is a [[List of alternative names for the human species|definition for humans]] proposed by the German [[neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]]. 

The tradition since [[Aristotle]] has defined a human being as ''animal rationale'' (a [[rational animal]]). However, Cassirer claimed that man's outstanding characteristic is not in his [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] or physical nature, but rather in his work. [[Human]]ity cannot be known directly, but has to be known through the analysis of the symbolic universe that man has created historically. Thus man should be defined as ''animal symbolicum'' (a symbol-making or symbolizing animal). 
On this basis, Cassirer sought to understand [[human nature]] by exploring symbolic forms in all aspects of a human being's experience. His work is represented in his three-volume ''Philosophie der Symbolischen Formen'' (1923–9, translated as ''The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms'') and is summarized in his ''An Essay on Man''. [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] used this term in his essay on "representation" to say that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"man, for many philosophers both ancient and modern, is the "representational animal,"  ''homo symbolicum'' {{sic}}, the creature whose distinctive character is the creation and manipulation of signs - things that stand for or take the place of something else." &lt;ref&gt;McLaughlin, T. &amp; Lentricchia, F. (1990). Critical Terms for [[Literary criticism|Literary Study]]. Chicago: [[University of Chicago|The University of Chicago]] press&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beit She'arim''' ({{lang-he-n|בֵּית שְׁעָרִים}}, "House of the Gates") is  the currently used name for the ancient Jewish town of '''Bet She'arāyim''' ({{Hebrew|בּית שערַיִם}}, "House of Two Gates") or '''Kfar She'arāyim''' ({{Hebrew|כְּפר שערַיִם}}, "Village of Two Gates").&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt; The site, located on a hill, was known initially by its [[Arabic]] name '''Sheikh Ibreik''' or '''Sheikh Abreik''',&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt; and which historical geographer [[Samuel Klein (scholar)|Samuel Klein]] in 1936 identified as Talmudic Beit She'arim.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 137 in: {{cite journal |last=Vitto|first=Fanny |title=Byzantine Mosaics at Bet She'arim: New Evidence for the History of the Site |journal='Atiqot |accessdate=31 August 2018 |volume=28|issue= |pages=115-146 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23458348 |date=1996|registration=yes |via=[[JSTOR]]}}. In the [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (''Kila'im'' 9:3), the town's name is written in an elided-consonant form, ({{Lang-he-n|בית שריי}}), which follows more closely the Greek transliteration in Josephus' ''[[Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' § 24, ({{lang-gr|Βησάραν}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Another Arabic name is ''bayt al-ġurabāʾ'' ({{lang|ar|بيت الغرباء}}).{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The partially excavated archaeological site consists mainly of an extensive [[necropolis]] of [[Rock-cut tombs in ancient Israel|rock-cut tombs]] and some remains of the town itself. The site is managed by the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority|National Parks Authority]] as the '''Beit She'arim National Park'''. It borders the town of [[Kiryat Tiv'on]] on the northeast and is located five kilometres west of [[Moshav]] [[Beit She'arim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0003_0_02881.html Modern Bet She'arim] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated 20&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Haifa]] in the southern foothills of the [[Lower Galilee]].

In 2015 it was declared a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The rationale of the committee was as follows: The town's vast necropolis, carved out of soft limestone, contains more than 30 burial cave systems. Although only a portion of the necropolis has been excavated, it has been likened to a book inscribed in stone. Its catacombs, mausoleums, and sarcophagi are adorned with elaborate symbols and figures as well as an impressive quantity of incised and painted inscriptions in Hebrew, Aramaic, Palmyrene, and Greek, documenting two centuries of historical and cultural achievement. The wealth of artistic adornments contained in this, the most ancient extensive Jewish cemetery in the world, is unparalleled anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4676480,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1471], [[UNESCO world heritage site]],&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
According to [[Moshe Sharon]], following [[Yechezkel Kutscher]], the name of the city was Beit She'arayim or Kfar She'arayim (the House/Village of Two Gates).&lt;ref name="Sharon"&gt;Sharon, Moshe (2004), Corpus Inscriptionum Arabicarum Palaestinae, Vol. III, D-F; page XXXVII [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR37#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Yemenite Jewish pronunciation of the name is also "Bet She'arayim", which is more closely related to the [[Ancient Greek]] rendition of the name, i.e. Βησάρα, "Besara".&lt;ref&gt;''Babylonian Talmud, Punctuated'' ({{Hebrew|תלמוד בבלי מנוקד}}), ed. Yosef Amar, Jerusalem 1980, s.v. ''Sanhedrin'' 32b (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular orthography for the Hebrew word for house, {{Hebrew|בֵּית}}, is "beit", while the traditional King James one is "beth", the effort being now to replace both with the etymologically better suited "bet".

==History==

===Iron Age===
Pottery shards discovered at the site indicate that a first settlement there dates back to the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Second Temple period===
[[File:BeitShearimSarcophagus1-v.jpg|thumb|200px|Two lions facing each other, a Greek mythological scene decorating a sarcophagus in the Cave of the Coffins]]
Beit She'arayim was founded at the end of the 1st century BCE, during the reign of King [[Herod the Great|Herod]].&lt;ref name=Mazar19&gt;Benjamin Mazar, ''Beth She'arim : Report on the Excavations during 1936-1940'', Vol. I, p19.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman Jewish historian [[Josephus Flavius]], in his [[The Life of Flavius Josephus|''Vita'']], referred to the city in Greek as Besara, the administrative center of the estates of [[Berenice II of Egypt|Queen Berenice]] in the [[Jezreel Valley]].&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;

===Roman and Byzantine periods===
[[Benjamin Mazar]] described it as a prosperous [[Jew]]ish town eventually destroyed by fire in 352, at the end of the [[Jewish revolt against Gallus]] and that after some time it was renewed as a [[Byzantine]] city,&lt;ref name=Mazar19/&gt; but more recent research shows that the Gallus revolt had a much lesser impact on the town.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; The [[Galilee earthquake of 363]] did damage Bet She'arayim, but without long-lasting effects.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

After the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE, the  [[Sanhedrin]] (Jewish legislature and supreme council) moved to Beit She'arayim.&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt; The town is mentioned rabbinical literature as an important center of Jewish learning during the 2nd century.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; Rabbi [[Judah the Prince]] (Yehudah HaNasi), head of the Sanhedrin and compiler of the [[Mishna]], lived there. In the last seventeen years of his life, he moved to [[Sepphoris]] for health reasons, but planned his burial in Beit She'arim. According to tradition, he owned there land he received as a gift from his friend, the Roman emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] Antoninus.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The most desired burial place for Jews was the [[Mount of Olives]] in [[Jerusalem]], but in 135 CE, when Jews were barred from the area, Beit She'arim became an alternative.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GhPlUt1kz-wC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=land+beit+she%27arim&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=IHnzWvgzpQ&amp;sig=8ycK-VQl1S8C-BScn4fxQfR8iqI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=czzcSp_6NqSwnQPvpKzaDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Holy Land: An Oxford archaeological guide, From earliest times to 1700, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried there led many other Jews from all over the country and from the [[Jewish Diaspora]], from nearby [[Phoenicia]]&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; to far-away [[Himyar]] in [[Yemen]],&lt;ref name="Hymiar"&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 53–57, 148, 283–284 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt; to be buried next to his grave.

While it was originally thought that Bet She'arayim was destroyed during the [[Jewish revolt against Gallus]] in the mid-4th century, recent research has revealed the destruction to be far less extensive.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; An earthquake in 386 caused some damage, but the town recovered and enjoyed prosperity during the era of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine rule]].&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; Almost 300 inscriptions primarily in [[Greek language|Greek]], but also in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], and [[Palmyrene dialect|Palmyrene]] were found on the walls of the catacombs containing numerous sarcophagi.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Early Islamic period===
From the beginning of the Early Islamic period (7th century), settlement was sparse.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar, p20.&lt;/ref&gt; Excavations uncovered 75 lamps dating to the period of [[Umayyad]] (7th-8th centuries) and [[Abassid]] (8th-13th centuries) rule over Palestine.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt; A large Abbasid-period [[glassmaking]] facility from the 9th century was also found at the site (see [[Beit She'arim National Park#Glassmaking industry (Abbasid period)|below]]).

===Crusader period===
There is some evidence of activity in the former city area and necropolis dating to the [[Crusades|Crusader period]] (12th century), probably connected to travellers and temporary settlement.&lt;ref name=Negev/&gt;

===Ottoman period===
A small Arab village called [[Sheikh Bureik, Lajjun|Sheikh Bureik]] was located here in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hütteroth, Wolf-Dieter; Abdulfattah, Kamal (1977), Historical Geography of Palestine, Transjordan and Southern Syria in the Late 16th Century. Erlanger Geographische Arbeiten, Sonderband, Erlangen, Germany: Vorstand der Fränkischen Geographischen Gesellschaft, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; A map by [[Pierre Jacotin]]  from [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|Napoleon's invasion of 1799]] showed the place, named as ''Cheik Abrit.''&lt;ref&gt;Karmon, 1960, p. [http://www.jchp.ucla.edu/Bibliography/Karmon,_Y_1960_Jacotin_Map_(IEJ_10).pdf 163]&lt;/ref&gt;

The village is mentioned again in [[Palestine Exploration Fund|The Survey of Western Palestine]] (SWP) citing data from 1859,&lt;ref name=SWP.273&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/273/mode/1up 273]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1875 by [[Victor Guérin]].&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1880, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr01unkngoog#page/n408/mode/1up  395]-397&lt;/ref&gt; In 1872, the Ottoman authorities sold Shayk Abreik (together with a total of 23 villages and some seventy square miles of land) for £20,000 to the  [[Sursuk family]] of Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.  [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/356/mode/1up  356]&lt;/ref&gt; "The Survey of Western Palestine", published in 1881, describes Sheikh Abreik as a small village situated on a hill with a conspicuous [[Maqam (shrine)|''maqam'']] (sanctuary, holy tomb) located to the south. The village houses were made mostly of [[adobe|mud]], and it belonged to the Sursuk family. The population at this time was estimated to be around 150.&lt;ref name=SWP.273/&gt; During [[World War I]], the "finest oaks" of Sheikh Bureik were "ruthlessly destroyed" by the Turkish Army for use as rail fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Agriculture and Fisheries, report of 1923, quoted by R. El-Eini, British forestry policy in Mandate Palestine 1929-48: Aims and realities, ''Middle Eastern Studies'', Vol. 35, 1999, pp 72–155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British Mandate===
The October [[1922 census of Palestine]] recorded Sheikh Abreik with a population of 111 Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Haifa, p. [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/PalestineCensus1922/p33.pdf  33]&lt;/ref&gt; At some time during the early 1920s, the Sursuk family sold the lands of the village to the [[Jewish National Fund]], via [[Yehoshua Hankin]], a [[Zionist]] activist who was responsible for most of the major land purchases of the [[World Zionist Organization]] in Ottoman Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Avneri, 1984, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8Teb4dKHQcoC&amp;pg=PA122 122]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1925, according to [[Media:ShawSursockTable.png|List of villages sold by Sursocks and their partners to the Zionists since British occupation of Palestine]], evidence to the [[Shaw Commission]], 1930&lt;/ref&gt; After the sale, which included lands from the Arab villages of Harithiya, Sheikh Abreik and [[Harbaj]], a total of 59 Arab tenants were evicted from the three villages, with 3,314 pounds compensation paid.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth W. Stein]], ''The Land Question in Palestine, 1917-1939'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 an agricultural settlement also named Sheikh Abreik was established by the [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]], a Zionist political party and settlement movement.&lt;ref&gt;''Universal Jewish Encyclopedia'', Vol 6, entry "Colonies, Agricultural", p287.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological importance of the site was recognized in the 1880s by the Survey of Western Palestine, which explored many tombs and catacombs but did no excavation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp01conduoft#page/343/mode/1up Survey of Western Palestine, Vol. I, pp. 325-328 and 343-351]&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] village of Sheikh Bureik was located on the hill until the 1920s, when the land was purchased by the [[Jewish National Fund]].  In 1936, [[Alexander Zaïd]], employed by the JNF as a watchman, reported that he had found a breach in the wall of one of the caves which led into another cave decorated with inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;Mazar, p27.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1930s and 1950s, the site was excavated by Benjamin Mazar and [[Nahman Avigad]].

===Jewish necropolis===
Most of the remains date from the 2nd to 4th century CE. A large number of individuals were buried in the more than twenty catacombs of the necropolis. Geographical references in inscriptions on the walls of the catacombs reveal that the necropolis was used by people from the town of Beit She'arim, from elsewhere in Galilee, and even from cities as far away as [[Palmyra]] and [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East'' considers Beth She'arim of international importance (Volume 1, p. 309-11); Tessa Rajak considers its importance regional ("The rabbinic dead and the Diaspora dead at Beth She’arim" in P. Schäfer (ed.), ''The Talmud Yerushalmi and Graeco-Roman culture'' 1 (Tübingen 1997), p. 349-66); S. Schwartz however, in ''Imperialism and Jewish society, 200 B.C.E. to 640 C.E.'' (Princeton 2001), p. 153-8, plays down the importance of Beth She'arim.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from an extensive body of inscriptions in several languages, the walls and tombs have many images, engraved and carved in [[relief]], ranging from Jewish symbols and geometric decoration to animals and figures from Hellenistic myth and religion.&lt;ref name="Beth She'arim"&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1643/ Beth She'arim], [[UNESCO world heritage site]] "tentative list", summary from 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, two new caves were opened to the public whose burial vaults date to the first two centuries CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1124426.html Row erupts over discovery of Beit Shearim caves, [[Haaretz]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cave of Judah the Prince====
The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] cites Beit She'arim as the burial place of Rabbi [[Judah the Prince]], Yehuda HaNasi in Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Kelaim 9, 32a-b&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral is described as follows: "Miracles were wrought on that day. It was evening and all the towns gathered to mourn him, and eighteen synagogues praised him and bore him to Bet Shearim, and the daylight remained until everyone reached his home (Ketubot 12, 35a)." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishmag.com/97mag/betshearim/betshearim.htm Bet Shearim archaeology]&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Rabbi Judah was buried here is believed to be a major reason for the popularity of the necropolis in Late Antiquity. The catacomb No. 14 is likely to have belonged to the family of Rabbi Judah the Prince.&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web |title=Beit She'arim - The Jewish necropolis of the Roman Period |author= |work=www.mfa.gov.il |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=2000 |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/mfa/israelexperience/history/pages/beit%20she-arim%20-%20the%20jewish%20necropolis%20of%20the%20roman.aspx |accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clear inscription stating the name and title of Rabbi Judah the Prince in that catacomb identifies it as his burial site.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford encyclopedia of Archaeology in the Near East'', Volume 1, p. 309-11. For a more cautious view see M. Jacobs, ''Die Institution des jüdischen Patriarchen, eine quellen- und traditionskritische Studie zur Geschichte der Juden in der Spätantike'' (Tübingen 1995), p. 247, n. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; A Hebrew wall inscription from Catacomb 14 reads "Simon [Shimon] my son shall be [[hakham]] [president of the Sanhedrin], Gamaliel my son [[Nasi (Hebrew title)#Late Roman empire to medieval period|patriarch]], Hanania bar Hama shall preside over the great court", in reference to Rabbi Judah's sons Rabbi Shimon and Rabbi Gamliel, and to his student, Rabbi [[Hanina bar Hama]].&lt;ref name="MFA"/&gt;  Two tombs located next to each other within the same catacomb are identified by bilingual Hebrew and Greek inscriptions as those of "R.

====Himyarite tombs====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Yemenite Jews]] ([[MOS:HEAD]])--&gt;
[[File:Tomb Inscription of Himyarite buried in Beit She'arim National Park (Israel).jpg|thumb|right|Tomb of Himyarite, in Greek uncials]]

In 1937, [[Benjamin Mazar]] revealed at Beit She'arim a system of tombs belonging to the Jews of [[Himyar]] (now [[Yemen]]) dating back to the 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946,  pp. 53–57, 148, 283–284 (Hebrew).&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of ties between Yemenite Jewry and the Land of Israel can be learnt by the system of tombs at Beit She'arim dating back to the 3rd century. It is of great significance that Jews from Ḥimyar were being brought for interment in what was then considered a prestigious place, near the catacombs of the [[Sanhedrin]]. Those who had the financial means brought their dead to be buried in the Land of Israel, as it was considered an outstanding virtue for Jews not to be buried in foreign lands, but rather in the land of their forefathers. It is speculated that the Ḥimyarites, during their lifetime, were known and respected in the eyes of those who dwelt in the Land of Israel, seeing that one of them, whose name was Menaḥem, was coined the epithet ''qyl ḥmyr'' [prince of Ḥimyar], in the eight-character Ḥimyari ligature, while in the Greek inscription he was called ''Menae presbyteros'' (Menaḥem, the community's elder).&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Seminar for Arabian Studies, 43 (2013): British Museum, London; Article by Yosef Tobi, ''The Jews of Yemen in light of the excavation of the Jewish synagogue in Qanī’'', p. 351.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of a woman written in Greek in its genitive form, Ενλογιαζ, is also engraved there, meaning either 'virtue', 'blessing', or 'gratis'; however, its precise transcription remains of scholarly dispute.&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Hirschberg, ''Yisrā’ēl ba-‘Arāb'', Tel Aviv 1946, pp. 56 – 57; p. 33 plate b. Christian Robin rejects the interpretation of the ligature ''qyl ḥmyr''. He notes that today the inscription ''Menae presbyteros'' can no longer be seen. The only secured inscription is ''Ômêritôn'' [the Ḥimyari].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abbasid period===

====Glassmaking industry====
In 1956, a bulldozer working at the site unearthed an enormous rectangular slab, 11×6.5×1.5 feet, weighing 9 tons. Initially, it was paved over, but it was eventually studied and found to be a gigantic piece of glass. A [[glassmaking]] furnace was located here in the 9th century during the [[History of Palestine#Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid periods|Abbasid period]], which produced great batches of molten glass that were cooled and later broken into small pieces for crafting glass vessels.&lt;ref name=Negev&gt;Negev and Gibson, 2001, [https://books.google.com/books?id=27nq65cZUIgC&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=sheikh+ibreik&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=sheikh%20ibreik&amp;f=false  pp86-87].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmog.org/dynamic.aspx?id=9420 The Mystery Slab of Beit She'arim, Corning Glass Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:מערת_הלולבים.JPG|thumb|"Cave of the [[Lulav]]im"]]

====Poem inside catacomb====
An [[elegy]] written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] script typical of the 9-10th century and containing the date AH 287 or 289 (AD 900 or 902) was found in the ''Magharat al-Jahannam'' ("Cave of Hell") catacomb during excavations conducted there in 1956. The sophisticated and beautifully worded elegy was composed by the previously unknown poet Umm al-Qasim, whose name is given in [[acrostic]] in the poem, and it can be read in Moshe Sharon's book or [[Sheikh Bureik, Lajjun#Poem from Abbasid period|here]] on Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=Sharon.xli&gt;Sharon, 2004, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;pg=PR41 xli]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moshe Sharon speculates that this poem might be marking the beginning of the practice of treating this site as the sanctuary of Sheikh Ibreik and suggests the site was used for burial at this time and possibly later as well.&lt;ref name="Sharon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sharon.xlii&gt;Sharon, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?id=01ogNhTNz54C&amp;pg=PR42  p.xlii]&lt;/ref&gt; He further notes that the cave within which the inscription was found forms part of a vast area of ancient ruins which constituted a natural place for the emergence of a local shrine. Drawing on the work of Tawfiq Canaan, Sharon cites his observation that 32% of the sacred sites he visited in Palestine were located in the vicinity of ancient ruins.&lt;ref name=Sharon.xlii/&gt;

===Recent excavations===
[[File:The gate of Bet Shearim 01.jpg|250px|thumb|The gate of Bet Shearim  that eas published on January 2017]]
The excavations at the site were resumed by  Adi Erlich, on behalf of the Zinman Institute of Archaeology, The [[University of Haifa]]. Erlich is focusing her excavation on the hilltop above the necropolis, where the ancient town had existed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Beth-Shearim-Excavation/556477027790445 Official Facebook page of renewed expedition]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carmine Benincasa''' (born 17 December 1947 in [[Eboli]]) is an Italian art critic and [[Art History|art historian]] professor.

== Biography ==
'''Carmine Benincasa''' was born in [[Eboli]] in the south of Italy. After studying in a religious school he moved to [[Rome]] to study [[theology]], [[philosophy]] and [[law]].

He was a professor of art history at the [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Macerata]], the Academy of Fine Arts in [[Florence]] and Professor of History of Art at the [[Faculty of Architecture]] of the [[University La Sapienza]] in Rome. During this period he met intellectuals like [[Jean-Paul Sartre]],&lt;ref&gt;http://bibliothequekandinsky.centrepompidou.fr/clientBookline/service/reference.asp?INSTANCE=INCIPIO&amp;OUTPUT=PORTAL&amp;DOCID=0357919&amp;DOCBASE=CGPP{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Marguerite Yourcenar]], [[Bruno Zevi]] and many more.

From 1978 to 1982 he was a member of the [[Venice Biennale]] Visual Arts Committee&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1987/10/16/biennale-il-psi-fa-incetta-di-poltrone.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and an advisor to the Ministry of Culture and Environment. In 1994 he was briefly accused and incarcerated for defrauding collectors by validating and selling false artworks.&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/07/08/critico-arte-professore-in-cella-per.html&lt;/ref&gt; The case was subsequently thrown out of court for lack of evidence. Benincasa was eventually cleared of every wrongdoing by the [[Supreme Court of Italy]] in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id%3D239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804000431/http://www.errorigiudiziari.com/pag_innocenti_ante.php?id=239 |archivedate=2010-08-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benincasa has published numerous essays, articles and monographs on artists such as [[Paul Klee]], [[Antoni Tàpies]], [[Renato Guttuso]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Mario Ceroli]], [[Willem De Kooning]], [[Joan Mirò]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Giacomo Balla]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Henri Matisse]] and [[Giorgio Morandi]]. He has also organized many international exhibitions, including a section of the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1982.

Benincasa is currently chief editor of the Italian edition of ''[[Cahiers d'Art]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3232">'''Coal slurry''' is a mixture of solids (mined [[coal]]) and liquids (usually water) produced by a [[coal preparation plant]].  As a [[slurry]], coal is separated from non-combustable components (ash) and can be fractionated by particle size as well.  Coal slurry can be transferred by pipeline&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redvalve.com/rv/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=137&amp;Itemid=56 Red Valve Company: Coal Slurry Pipeline]&lt;/ref&gt; or with specialised pumps such as a [[progressive cavity pump]] to pump the highly abrasive, corrosive and viscous coal slurry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Reasons why you should choose the right pump for coal slurry. | url=http://www.globalpumps.com.au/case-studies/2012/transferring-coal-slurry-made-easy/ | date=2012-07-18 | accessdate=September 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scale of water usage and hence potential costs and problems is large.  More than 7 billion tons of coal are mined per year (2010), using approximately 200 litres of water per ton.&lt;ref&gt;D. Woodruff and L. Macnamara, "Treatment of coal tailings" in "The Coal Handbook: Towards Cleaner Production" D Osborne, Ed. Woodhead Publishing, 2013. Print {{ISBN|0-85709-422-X}}.

[[File:Coal slurry spill at Patriot Coal, WV.jpg|thumb|A 2014 coal slurry spill into a river at Patriot Coal, West Virginia. A straw impoundment has been created across the river to try to hold the spillage.&lt;ref name="Coal slurry spill blackens 6 miles of West Virginia creek"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Conlon|first1=Kevin|title=Officials: Coal slurry spill blackens 6 miles of West Virginia creek|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/11/us/west-virginia-slurry-spill/|website=CNN|accessdate=2 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ideally, coal slurry consists only of crushed [[coal]] and water, which can be separated perfectly at low cost.  In practice, the separation is significantly costly(citation needed).  Furthermore, the slurry consists also of very fine coal dust that results in a waste called [[blackwater (coal)|blackwater]], which is stored in large impoundment ponds, often together with [[coal ash]].  Such ponds are susceptible to disastrous releases, such as the [[Buffalo Creek flood]] of 1972.   This impounded liquid waste can sometimes total billions of gallons in a single facility.  &lt;!-- coal ash is not coal slurryThe largest coal slurry impound in the United States, at [[Little Blue Run Lake]],  holds 20 billion gallons of coal ash and smokestack scrubber waste).&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopey|first=Don|date=3 April 2014|title=Little Blue Run coal ash site to close sooner; Plant owner must contain pollution |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2014/04/04/Coal-ash-site-to-close-sooner/stories/201404040080|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|accessdate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

Clary Sage College (CSC) is a cosmetology college based in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma|Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]]. Clary Sage College was established by [[Teresa Knox]] in 2005 as a branch campus of Community Care College.&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Laurie. [http://www.tulsaworld.com/business/article.aspx?subjectid=46&amp;articleid=20080919_46_E4_Please644701 "5 Questions with Teresa Knox"], ''[[Tulsa World]]'', Tulsa, 19 September 2008. Retrieved on 28 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The College is a degree-granting institution; students are eligible to earn an Associate of Occupational Science degrees in several of the programs offered by taking additional courses at the main campus, Community Care College.

The success of Community Care College (CCC) led to a decision by CEO and founder [[Teresa Knox]] to expand the career-based college by creating a second campus. Clary Sage College (CSC) was developed to provide an advanced education in the field of cosmetology, operating simultaneously as a cosmetology college and functioning spa so students could practice their skills and build clientele in a professional, real-world setting.&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Laurie.

Retrieved on 17 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, CSC expanded to include programs in Fashion and Interior Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Knox, Teresa (Host) |year=2011 |title=Modular Buildings - Clary Sage College Addition |medium=Video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTZHaqdTebk |accessdate=28 May 2013 |archivedate=3 November 2011 |format=Streaming Video |publisher=Ramtech Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Summer of 2015, the college converted from for-profit to nonprofit status in order to expand educational opportunities to those that need it the most through increased scholarships and reduced tuition.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld.com"/&gt;

The school is accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS) and licensed by the Oklahoma State Board of Cosmetology and the Oklahoma Board of Private Vocational Schools.&lt;ref name="ClarySage"&gt;"Clary Sage College Catalog 2011", ''Clary Sage College'', Tulsa, Retrieved 8 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Clary Sage College and/or employees have current affiliations with the National Cosmetology Association, America Association of Cosmetology Schools (AACS) and the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities (APSCU). Clary Sage College is approved by the U.S. Department of Education and for Veterans Education.&lt;ref&gt;"Employee Manual 2012", ''Clary Sage College'', Tulsa, 1 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campus===
In 2006, construction began on the current   campus located at 3131 S Sheridan Road Tulsa, OK. The property sits on six acres and is one of the largest schools of its kind in the United States.&lt;ref name="ClarySage" /&gt; The first floor was designed to resemble an upscale spa and includes a salon floor, barber shop, massage and esthetician clinics, pedicure and manicuring rooms, and a dispensary, all of which are used for the "hands-on" components of the curriculum of each program. The second floor hosts classrooms, computer lab and library.
In   2006, it began its expansion into a multi-campus college, starting with the establishment and construction of Clary Sage College (CSC). CSC was developed to provide an advanced education in the field of cosmetology, operating simultaneously as a cosmetology college and functioning spa so students could practice their skills in a professional setting.&lt;ref&gt;Winslow, Laurie.

Retrieved on 27 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the college expanded to include programs in Fashion and Interior Design.

==Oklahoma Technical College==
The success of '''Clary Sage College''' led to a decision to establish '''Oklahoma Technical College''' (OTC), offering programs in automotive technology, diesel technology, welding technology, and heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC) and refrigeration. OTC opened in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Banuelos, Rebecca. [http://www.free-press-release.com/news/200904/1241104066.html "Oklahoma Technical College Opens Campus Store"], ''[[Press Release]]'', Tulsa, 30 April 2009. Retrieved on 09 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The colleges operated under a for-profit corporation for 20 years, and on June 30, the assets of the colleges were acquired by a newly formed 501(c)(3) public charity, Community HigherEd.

Career colleges play a critical role in the nation's economic growth and development.  With the U.S. ranking 14th in people between the ages of 25-34 with a college degree, career-focused training of specialized skills will continue being instrumental in improving that metric so that the country improves international standing.

Although tax status with the IRS has changed, Founder [[Teresa Knox]] states that the company currently operates similar to a non-profit on many counts: it is socially wired, has a transparent culture, and is committed to being a contributing force to the community. The college wants to continue being evaluated, as all higher education institutions should be, on student outcomes….graduation rates, job placement rates, and student loan default rates.
 
"‘For Profit’ is periphery to our primary mission and purpose and minimizes our long-term goal," states CEO Teresa Knox, "Our strategy is to increase the number and amount of scholarships offered to students in order to reduce student loan debt and expand educational and career opportunities to those that need it most." &lt;ref name="tulsaworld.com"/&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}
'''Computational complexity theory''' focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical [[models of computation]] to study these problems and quantifying their [[computational complexity]], i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in [[communication complexity]]), the number of [[logic gate|gates]] in a circuit (used in [[circuit complexity]]) and the number of processors (used in [[parallel computing]]). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The [[P versus NP problem]], one of the seven [[Millenium Prize Problems]], is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=P vs NP Problem {{!}} Clay Mathematics Institute |url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem |website=www.claymath.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[computability theory]]. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.

==Computational problems==
[[Image:TSP Deutschland 3.png|thumb|333px|A traveling salesman tour through 14 German cities.]]

===Problem instances===
A [[computational problem]] can be viewed as an infinite collection of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of [[primality testing]]. The instance is a number (e.g., 15) and the solution is "yes" if the number is prime and "no" otherwise (in this case, 15 is not prime and the answer is "no"). Stated another way, the ''instance'' is a particular input to the problem, and the ''solution'' is the output corresponding to the given input.

To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the [[traveling salesman problem]]: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in [[Milan]] whose total length is at most 10&amp;nbsp;km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.

===Representing problem instances===
When considering computational problems, a problem instance is a [[string (computer science)|string]] over an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are [[bitstring]]s. As in a real-world [[computer]], mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, [[integer]]s can be represented in [[binary notation]], and [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s can be encoded directly via their [[adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]], or by encoding their [[adjacency list]]s in binary.

Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.

===Decision problems as formal languages===
[[Image:Decision Problem.svg|thumb|200px|A [[decision problem]] has only two possible outputs, ''yes'' or ''no'' (or alternately 1 or 0) on any input.]]
[[Decision problem]]s are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either ''yes'' or ''no'', or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem can be viewed as a [[formal language]], where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an [[algorithm]], whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer ''yes'', the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.

An example of a decision problem is the following. The input is an arbitrary [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is [[connectivity (graph theory)|connected]], or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs — to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.

===Function problems===
A [[function problem]] is a computational problem where a single output (of a [[total function]]) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a [[decision problem]]—that is, the output isn't just yes or no. Notable examples include the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]].

It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'') such that the relation ''a''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.

===Measuring the size of an instance===
To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2''n'' vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with ''n'' vertices?

If the input size is ''n'', the time taken can be expressed as a function of ''n''. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(''n'') is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size ''n''. If T(''n'') is a polynomial in ''n'', then the algorithm is said to be a [[polynomial time]] algorithm. [[Cobham's thesis]] argues that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.

==Machine models and complexity measures==

===Turing machine===
[[File:Turing machine 2b.svg|thumb|right|300px|An illustration of a Turing machine]]
{{main|Turing machine}}
A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a general model of a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a [[RAM machine]], [[Conway's Game of Life]], [[cellular automata]] or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.

Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as [[deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s, [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[symmetric Turing machine]]s and [[alternating Turing machine]]s. They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.

A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called [[randomized algorithm]]s. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see [[non-deterministic algorithm]].

===Other machine models===
Many machine models different from the standard [[Turing machine equivalents#Multi-tape Turing machines|multi-tape Turing machines]] have been proposed in the literature, for example [[random access machine]]s. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Arora|Barak|2009|loc=Chapter 1: The computational model and why it doesn't matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; What all these models have in common is that the machines operate [[deterministic algorithm|deterministically]].

However, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that [[non-deterministic time]] is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.

===Complexity measures===
For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the [[deterministic Turing machine]] is used. The ''time required'' by a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' on input ''x'' is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ("yes" or "no"). A Turing machine ''M'' is said to operate within time ''f''(''n''), if the time required by ''M'' on each input of length ''n'' is at most ''f''(''n''). A decision problem ''A'' can be solved in time ''f''(''n'') if there exists a Turing machine operating in time ''f''(''n'') that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time ''f''(''n'') on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by [[DTIME]](''f''(''n'')).

Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any [[Complexity|complexity measure]] can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the [[Blum complexity axioms]]. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include [[communication complexity]], [[circuit complexity]], and [[decision tree complexity]].

The complexity of an algorithm is often expressed using [[big O notation]].

===Best, worst and average case complexity===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|250px|Visualization of the [[quicksort]] [[algorithm]] that has [[Best, worst and average case|average case performance]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The [[best, worst and average case]] complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size ''n'' may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:
#Best-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size ''n''.
#Average-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem on an average. This complexity is only defined with respect to a [[probability distribution]] over the inputs. For instance, if all inputs of the same size are assumed to be equally likely to appear, the average case complexity can be defined with respect to the uniform distribution over all inputs of size ''n''.
#[[Amortized analysis]]: Amortized analysis considers both the costly and less costly operations together over the whole series of operations of the algorithm.
#Worst-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size ''n''.
The order from cheap to costly is: Best, average (of [[discrete uniform distribution]]), amortized, worst.

For example, consider the deterministic sorting algorithm [[quicksort]]. This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time [[Big O notation|O]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(''n'' log ''n''). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(''n'' log ''n'') time.

===Upper and lower bounds on the complexity of problems===
To classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the maximum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of [[analysis of algorithms]]. To show an upper bound ''T''(''n'') on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most ''T''(''n''). However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase "all possible algorithms" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of ''T''(''n'') for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than ''T''(''n'').

Upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the [[big O notation]], which hides constant factors and smaller terms. This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used. For instance, if ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;40, in big O notation one would write ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Complexity classes==
{{main|Complexity class}}

===Defining complexity classes===
A '''complexity class''' is a set of problems of related complexity. Simpler complexity classes are defined by the following factors:
* The type of computational problem: The most commonly used problems are decision problems. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s, [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s, [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.
* The model of computation: The most common model of computation is the deterministic Turing machine, but many complexity classes are based on non-deterministic Turing machines, [[Boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.
* The resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds: These two properties are usually stated together, such as "polynomial time", "logarithmic space", "constant depth", etc.

Some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework. Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:

:The set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within time ''f''(''n''). (This complexity class is known as DTIME(''f''(''n'')).)

But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham-Edmonds thesis]] states that "the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class [[P (complexity)|P]], which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is [[FP (complexity)|FP]].

===Important complexity classes===

[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|250px|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among complexity classes]]
Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:

The logarithmic-space classes (necessarily) do not take into account the space needed to represent the problem.

It turns out that PSPACE = NPSPACE and EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE by [[Savitch's theorem]].

Other important complexity classes include [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]], [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]] and [[RP (complexity)|RP]], which are defined using [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s; [[AC (complexity)|AC]] and [[NC (complexity)|NC]], which are defined using Boolean circuits; and [[BQP]] and [[QMA]], which are defined using quantum Turing machines. [[Sharp-P|#P]] is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like [[IP (complexity)|IP]] and [[AM (complexity)|AM]] are defined using [[Interactive proof system]]s. [[ALL (complexity)|ALL]] is the class of all decision problems.

===Hierarchy theorems===
{{main|time hierarchy theorem|space hierarchy theorem}}
For the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(''n'') is contained in DTIME(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.

More precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{DTIME}\big(f(n) \big) \subsetneq \mathsf{DTIME} \big(f(n) \sdot \log^{2}(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{DSPACE}\big(f(n)\big) \subsetneq \mathsf{DSPACE} \big(f(n) \sdot \log(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.

===Reduction===
{{main|Reduction (complexity)}}
Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at most as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.

The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.

This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems ''C'' if every problem in ''C'' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in ''C'' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in ''C''. The notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of [[NP-hard]] problems.

If a problem ''X'' is in ''C'' and hard for ''C'', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for ''C''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in ''C''. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in ''C''.) Thus the class of [[NP-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to another problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an [[NP-complete]] problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP.&lt;ref name="Sipser2006"/&gt;

==Important open problems==
[[Image:Complexity classes.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of complexity classes provided that P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP. The existence of problems in NP outside both P and NP-complete in this case was established by Ladner.&lt;ref name="Ladner75"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ladner|first=Richard E.|title=On the structure of polynomial time reducibility|journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] |volume=22|year=1975|pages=151–171|doi=10.1145/321864.321877|issue=1|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===P versus NP problem===
{{Main|P versus NP problem}}

The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm. This hypothesis is called the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]]. The complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], the [[Hamiltonian path problem]] and the [[vertex cover problem]]. Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.

The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution.&lt;ref name="Sipser2006"&gt;See {{harvnb|Sipser|2006|loc= Chapter 7: Time complexity}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions. These include various types of [[integer programming]] problems in [[operations research]], many problems in [[logistics]], [[protein structure prediction]] in [[biology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Protein folding in the hydrophobic-hydrophilic (HP) model is NP-complete|last=Berger|first=Bonnie A.|author1-link=Bonnie Berger|journal=Journal of Computational Biology|year=1998|volume=5|pages=27–40|pmid=9541869|doi=10.1089/cmb.1998.5.27|last2=Leighton|first2=T|author2-link=F.

===Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete===
It was shown by Ladner that if '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' then there exist problems in '''NP''' that are neither in '''P''' nor '''NP-complete'''.&lt;ref name="Ladner75" /&gt; Such problems are called [[NP-intermediate]] problems. The [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[discrete logarithm problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]] are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in '''P''' or to be '''NP-complete'''.

The [[graph isomorphism problem]] is the computational problem of determining whether two finite [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]]. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in '''P''', '''NP-complete''', or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete.&lt;ref name="AK06"&gt;{{Citation

The best algorithm for this problem, due to [[László Babai]] and [[Eugene Luks]] has run time &lt;math&gt;O(2^{\sqrt{n \log n}})&lt;/math&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices, although some recent work by Babai offers some potentially new perspectives on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Babai |first=László |date=2016 |title=Graph Isomorphism in Quasipolynomial Time |eprint=1512.03547 |class=cs.DS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[integer factorization problem]] is the computational problem of determining the [[prime factorization]] of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a prime factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in '''NP''' and in '''co-NP''' (and even in UP and co-UP&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]]. Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring. September 13, 2002. http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html&lt;/ref&gt;). If the problem is '''NP-complete''', the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., '''NP''' will equal '''co-NP'''). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the [[general number field sieve]], which takes time &lt;math&gt;O(e^{\left(\frac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}(\log n)^{1/3}(\log \log n)^{2/3}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram MathWorld: [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberFieldSieve.html Number Field Sieve]&lt;/ref&gt; to factor an integer ''n''. However, the best known [[quantum algorithm]] for this problem, [[Shor's algorithm]], does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

===Separations between other complexity classes===
Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved. For instance '''P''' ⊆ '''NP''' ⊆ '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' ⊆ '''PSPACE''', but it is possible that '''P''' = '''PSPACE'''. If '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', then '''P''' is not equal to '''PSPACE''' either. Since there are many known complexity classes between '''P''' and '''PSPACE''', such as '''RP''', '''BPP''', '''PP''', '''BQP''', '''MA''', '''PH''', etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.

Along the same lines, '''[[co-NP]]''' is the class containing the [[Complement (complexity)|complement]] problems (i.e. problems with the ''yes''/''no'' answers reversed) of '''NP''' problems. It is believed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/ Boaz Barak's course on Computational Complexity] [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/lec2.pdf Lecture 2]&lt;/ref&gt; that '''NP''' is not equal to '''co-NP'''; however, it has not yet been proven. It is clear that if these two complexity classes are not equal then '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', since if '''P'''='''NP''' we would also have '''P'''='''co-NP''', since problems in '''NP''' are dual to those in '''co-NP'''.

Similarly, it is not known if '''L''' (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in '''P''' or equal to '''P'''. Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as '''NL''' and '''NC''', and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.

It is suspected that '''P''' and '''BPP''' are equal. However, it is currently open if '''BPP''' = '''NEXP'''.

{{wikt|tractable|feasible|intractability|infeasible}}
A problem that can be solved in theory (e.g. given large but finite resources, especially time), but for which in practice ''any'' solution takes too many resources to be useful, is known as an '''{{visible anchor|intractable problem}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, J.E., Motwani, R. and Ullman, J.D. (2007) [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]], Addison Wesley, Boston/San Francisco/New York (page 368)&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a problem that can be solved in practice is called a '''{{visible anchor|tractable problem}}''', literally "a problem that can be handled". The term ''[[wikt:infeasible|infeasible]]'' (literally "cannot be done") is sometimes used interchangeably with ''[[wikt:intractable|intractable]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Algorithms and Complexity |first=Gerard |last=Meurant |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-08093391-7 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6WriBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=computational+feasibility+tractability p. 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this risks confusion with a [[feasible solution]] in [[mathematical optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tractable problems are frequently identified with problems that have polynomial-time solutions ('''P''', '''PTIME'''); this is known as the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]]. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are [[EXPTIME]]-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then [[NP-hard]] problems are also intractable in this sense.

However, this identification is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, and may be impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that takes a long time in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in [[Presburger arithmetic]] has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete [[knapsack problem]] over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and [[SAT solver]]s routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].

To see why exponential-time algorithms are generally unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; operations before halting. For small ''n'', say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; operations each second, the program would run for about 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years, which is the same order of magnitude as the [[age of the universe]]. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes 1.0001&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; operations is practical until ''n'' gets relatively large.

Similarly, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances. Indeed, in practice even ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; algorithms are often impractical on realistic sizes of problems.

==History==
An early example of algorithm complexity analysis is the running time analysis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]] done by [[Gabriel Lamé]] in 1844.

Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers. Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer.

The beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal 1965 paper "On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms" by [[Juris Hartmanis]] and [[Richard E. Stearns]], which laid out the definitions of [[time complexity]] and [[space complexity]], and proved the hierarchy theorems.&lt;ref name="Fortnow 2003"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fortnow|Homer|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 1965 [[Jack Edmonds|Edmonds]] suggested to consider a "good" algorithm to be one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Karp, "[http://cecas.clemson.edu/~shierd/Shier/MthSc816/turing-karp.pdf Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness]", 1985 Turing Award Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include&lt;ref name="Fortnow 2003"/&gt; [[John Myhill]]'s definition of [[linear bounded automata]] (Myhill 1960), [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s study of rudimentary sets (1961), as well as [[Hisao Yamada]]'s paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yamada | first1 = H. | title = Real-Time Computation and Recursive Functions Not Real-Time Computable | journal = IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers | volume = EC-11 | issue = 6 | pages = 753–760 | year = 1962 | doi = 10.1109/TEC.1962.5219459}}&lt;/ref&gt; on real-time computations (1962). Somewhat earlier, [[Boris Trakhtenbrot]] (1956), a pioneer in the field from the USSR, studied another specific complexity measure.&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenbrot, B.A.: Signalizing functions and tabular operators. Uchionnye Zapiski
Penzenskogo Pedinstituta (Transactions of the Penza Pedagogoical Institute) 4, 75–87 (1956) (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; As he remembers:

{{quote|However, [my] initial interest [in automata theory] was increasingly set aside in favor of computational complexity, an exciting fusion of combinatorial methods, inherited from [[switching theory]], with the conceptual arsenal of the theory of algorithms. These ideas had occurred to me earlier in 1955 when I coined the term "signalizing function", which is nowadays commonly known as "complexity measure".&lt;ref&gt;Boris Trakhtenbrot, "From Logic to Theoretical Computer Science – An Update". In: ''Pillars of Computer Science'', LNCS 4800, Springer 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, [[Manuel Blum]] formulated a set of [[axiom]]s (now known as [[Blum axioms]]) specifying desirable properties of complexity measures on the set of computable functions and proved an important result, the so-called [[Blum's speedup theorem|speed-up theorem]]. The field began to flourish in 1971 when the [[Stephen Cook]] and [[Leonid Levin]] [[Cook–Levin theorem|proved]] the existence of practically relevant problems that are [[NP-complete]]. In 1972, [[Richard Karp]] took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", in which he showed that 21 diverse [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] and [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Richard M.

In the 1980s, much work was done on the average difficulty of solving NP-complete problems—both exactly and approximately. At that time, computational complexity theory was at its height, and it was widely believed that if a problem turned out to be NP-complete, then there was little chance of being able to work with the problem in a practical situation. However, it became increasingly clear that this is not always the case, and some authors claimed that general asymptotic results are often unimportant for typical problems arising in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1143|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11736">The '''Designation Scheme''' is an [[England|English]] system that awards "Designated status" to museum, library and archive collections of national and international importance.

The Scheme was first launched in 1997 under the auspices of what eventually became the [[Museums, Libraries and Archives Council]] (MLA) and originally covered only museum collections. [[Harewood House]] became the first stately home to be awarded Designated status in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/the-first-stately-museum-of-england-1196544.html The first stately museum of England], ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme was expanded to cover libraries and archives in 2005. Responsibility was transferred to the Arts Council in October 2011 following the closure of the MLA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/news/arts-council-news/museums-and-libraries-formally-transfer-arts-counc/.| title = Arts Council - Museums and libraries formally transfer to Arts Council England| accessdate = 10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers''''' (English: ''Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts''),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Buchanan, ''A Dictionary of Critical Theory'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; better known as '''''Encyclopédie''''', was a general [[encyclopedia]] published in [[France]] between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the [[Encyclopédistes]]. It was edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and, until 1759, co-edited by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].

The ''Encyclopédie'' is most famous for representing the thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. According to Denis Diderot in the article "Encyclopédie", the ''Encyclopédie'''s aim was "to change the way people think" and for people to be able to inform themselves and to know things.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot as quoted in Hunt, p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; He and the other contributors advocated for the [[secularization]] of learning away from the [[Jesuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University of the State of New York|title=Annual Report of the Regents, Volume 106|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABxEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot wanted to incorporate all of the world's knowledge into the ''Encyclopédie'' and hoped that the text could disseminate all this information to the public and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot as quoted in Kramnick, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors, and it was the first general encyclopedia to describe the [[Artes Mechanicae|mechanical arts]]. In the first publication, seventeen folio volumes were accompanied by detailed engravings. Later volumes were published without the engravings, in order to better reach a wide audience within Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2013). ''Books: a living history''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The ''Encyclopédie'' was originally conceived as a French translation of [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Magee, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Ephraim Chambers had first published his ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' in two volumes in London in 1728, following several dictionaries of arts and sciences that had emerged in Europe since the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1971. pp. 3–5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RS 1970"&gt;[[Robert Shackleton]] "[https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA390 The ''Encyclopedie'']" in: ''Proceedings, American Philosophical Society'' (vol. 114, No. 5, 1970. p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt; This work became quite renowned, and four editions were published between 1738 and 1742. An Italian translation appeared between 1747 and 1754. In France a member of the banking family Lambert had started translating Chambers into French,&lt;ref&gt;''Précis de la vie du citoyen Lambert'', Bibliothèque nationale, Ln. 11217; Listed in Shackleton (1970, p. 130).&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1745 the expatriate Englishman [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]] and German [[Gottfried Sellius]] were the first to actually prepare a French edition of Ephraim Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'' for publication, which they entitled ''Encyclopédie''.

Early in 1745 a prospectus for the ''Encyclopédie''&lt;ref&gt;Recently rediscovered in the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]'', see [http://blog.bnf.fr/lecteurs/index.php/2010/12/prospectus-pour-une-traduction-francaise-de-la-cyclopaedia-de-chambers/ Prospectus pour une traduction française de la Cyclopaedia de Chambers] blog.bnf.fr, Dec. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was published to attract subscribers to the project. This four page prospectus was illustrated by Jean-Michel Papillon,&lt;ref&gt;[[André-François Le Breton]], Jean-Michel Papillon, Ephraim Chambers. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-4AxtwAACAAJ Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire universel des arts et des sciences]''. 1745&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanied by a plan, stating that the work would be published in five volumes from June 1746 until the end of 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction from 1745 original in: Luneau de Boisjermain (1771) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIdYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 Mémoire pour les libraires associés à l'Encyclopédie: contre le sieur Luneau de Boisjermain].'' p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was translated by Mills and Sellius, and it was corrected by an unnamed person, who appears to have been [[Denis Diderot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp Blom]]. ''Encyclopédie: the triumph of reason in an unreasonable age Fourth Estate'', 2004. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospectus was reviewed quite positively and cited at some length in several journals.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=9OMTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 Prospectus du Dictionnaire de Chambers, traduit en François, et proposé par souscription]" in: M. Desfontaines. ''Jugemens sur quelques ouvrages nouveaux.'' Vol 8. (1745). p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts'' journal was lavish in its praise: "voici deux des plus fortes entreprises de Littérature qu'on ait faites depuis long-temps" (here are two of the greatest efforts undertaken in literature in a very long time).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eX9KAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA934 Review] in: ''Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts'', May 1745, Nr. 2. pp. 934–38&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mercure Journal'' in June 1745, printed a 25-page article that specifically praised Mill's role as translator; the ''Journal'' introduced Mills as an English scholar who had been raised in France and who spoke both French and English as a native. The ''Journal'' reported that Mills had discussed the work with several academics, was zealous about the project, had devoted his fortune to support this enterprise, and was the sole owner of the publishing privilege.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercure Journal'' (1745, p. 87) cited in: Lough (1971), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the cooperation fell apart later on in 1745. [[André Le Breton]], the publisher commissioned to manage the physical production and sales of the volumes, cheated Mills out of the subscription money, claiming for example that Mills's knowledge of French was inadequate. In a confrontation Le Breton physically assaulted Mills. Mills took Le Breton to court, but the court decided in Le Breton's favour. Mills returned to England soon after the court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Mills' summary of this matter was published in [[:fr:Pierre-Joseph Luneau de Boisjermain|Boisjermain]]'s ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wRhBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA162 Mémoire pour P. J. F. Luneau de Boisjermain av. d. Piéc. justif]'' 1771, pp. 162–63, where Boisjermain also gave his version of the events (pp. 2–5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comments by Le Breton are published in his biography; in the preface of the encyclopedia; in John Lough (1971); etc.&lt;/ref&gt; For his new editor, Le Breton settled on the mathematician [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]]. Among those hired by Malves were the young [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Denis Diderot]]. Within thirteen months, in August 1747, Gua de Malves was fired for being an ineffective leader. Le Breton then hired Diderot and d'Alembert to be the new editors.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot would remain as editor for the next twenty-five years, seeing the ''Encyclopédie'' through to its completion; d'Alembert would leave this role in 1758. As d'Alembert worked on the ''Encyclopédie'', its title expanded. As of 1750, the full title was ''Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de lettres, mis en ordre par M. Diderot de l'Académie des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Prusse, et quant à la partie mathématique, par M. d'Alembert de l'Académie royale des Sciences de Paris, de celle de Prusse et de la Société royale de Londres.'' ("Encyclopedia: or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts, by a Company of Persons of Letters, edited by M. Diderot of the Academy of Sciences and ''[[Belles-lettres]]'' of Prussia: as to the Mathematical Portion, arranged by M. d'Alembert of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris, to the Academy of Sciences in Prussia and to the Royal Society of London.") The title page was amended as d'Alembert acquired more titles.

==Publication==
[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice section 256px.jpg|thumb|Extract from the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of the ''Encyclopédie'' (1772). It was drawn by [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] and engraved by Bonaventure-Louis Prévost. The work is laden with [[symbol]]ism: The figure in the centre represents truth—surrounded by bright light (the central symbol of the Enlightenment). Two other figures on the right, reason and philosophy, are tearing the veil from truth.]]
The work consisted of 28 volumes, with 71,818 articles and 3,129 illustrations. The first seventeen volumes were published between 1751 and 1765; eleven volumes of plates were finished by 1772. Engraver [[Robert Bénard]] provided at least 1,800 plates for the work. Because of its occasional radical contents (see "Contents" below), the ''Encyclopédie'' caused much controversy in conservative circles, and on the initiative of the [[Joseph Omer Joly de Fleury#Opposition to the Encyclopédie|Parlement of Paris]], the French government suspended the encyclopedia's ''privilège'' in 1759.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Magee, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the suspension, work continued "in secret," partially because the project had highly placed supporters, such as [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]] and [[Madame de Pompadour]]. The authorities deliberately ignored the continued work; they thought their official ban was sufficient to appease the church and other enemies of the project.

During the "secretive" period, Diderot accomplished a well-known work of subterfuge. The title pages of volumes 1 through 7, published between 1751 and 1757, claimed Paris as the place of publication. However, the title pages of the subsequent text volumes, 8 through 17, published together in 1765, show Neufchastel as the place of publication. Neufchastel (now Neuchâtel) is safely across the French border in what is now part Switzerland but which was then an independent principality,&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, D (1992) ''Postcompulsory Education in Suisse romande'', unpublished PhD thesis, University of Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt; where official production of the ''Encyclopédie'' was secure from interference by agents of the French state. In particular, regime opponents of the ''Encyclopédie'' could not seize the production plates for the ''Encyclopédie'' in Paris because those printing plates ostensibly existed only in Switzerland. Meanwhile, the actual production of volumes 8 through 17 quietly continued in Paris.

In 1775, [[Charles Joseph Panckoucke]] obtained the rights to reissue the work. He issued five volumes of supplementary material and a two-volume index from 1776 to 1780. Some scholars include these seven "extra" volumes as part of the first full issue of the ''Encyclopédie'', for a total of 35 volumes, although they were not written or edited by the original authors.

&lt;!-- info taken from the French article --&gt;From 1782 to 1832, Panckoucke and his successors published an expanded edition of the work in some 166 volumes as the ''[[Encyclopédie méthodique]]''. That work, enormous for its time, occupied a thousand workers in production and 2,250 contributors.&lt;!-- From where this is it refers to the EM, but elsewhere the ''Encyclopédie''. Remove for now: The run of the press was 4,250 copies — a ridiculously small number for the present but very large for the 18th century where editions rarely exceeded 1,500 copies. --&gt;

==Contributors==
Since the objective of the editors of the ''Encyclopédie'' was to gather all the knowledge in the world, Diderot and D'Alembert knew they would need various contributors to help them with their project.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[philosophes]] ([[intellectuals]] of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]) contributed to the ''Encyclopédie'', including Diderot himself, [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The most prolific contributor was [[Louis de Jaucourt]], who wrote 17,266 articles between 1759 and 1765, or about eight per day, representing a full 25% of the ''Encyclopédie''. The publication became a place where these contributors could share their ideas and interests.

Still, as [[Frank Kafker]] has argued, the Encyclopedists were not a unified group:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camargofoundation.org/fellowdetails_new05.asp?recno=357 |title=Fellow Project Details |publisher=The Camargo Foundation |date= |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... despite their reputation, [the Encyclopedists] were not a close-knit group of [[Radicalization|radicals]] intent on subverting the Old Regime in France. Instead they were a disparate group of men of letters, physicians, scientists, craftsmen and scholars ... even the small minority who were persecuted for writing articles belittling what they viewed as unreasonable customs—thus weakening the might of the Catholic Church and undermining that of the monarchy—did not envision that their ideas would encourage a revolution.}}

Following is a list of notable contributors with their area of contribution (for a more detailed list, see [[Encyclopédistes]]):

*[[Jean Le Rond d'Alembert]] – editor; science (especially mathematics), contemporary affairs, philosophy, religion, among others
*[[Claude Bourgelat]] – manège, farriery
*[[André Le Breton]] – chief publisher; article on printer's ink &lt;!--to be noted elsewhere: he was the only person to have participated for the entire duration of the project.--&gt;
*[[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] – natural history
*[[Denis Diderot]] – chief editor; economics, mechanical arts, philosophy, politics, religion, among others
*[[Baron d'Holbach]] – science (chemistry, mineralogy), politics, religion, among others
*[[Louis de Jaucourt|Chevalier Louis de Jaucourt]] – economics, literature, medicine, politics, bookbinding, among others
*[[Jean-Baptiste de La Chapelle]] – mathematics
*[[Abbé]] [[André Morellet]] – theology, philosophy
*[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] – part of the article "Goût" ("Taste")
*[[François Quesnay]] – articles on tax farmers and grain
*[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] – music, political theory
*[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]] – economics, etymology, philosophy, physics
*[[Voltaire]] – history, literature, philosophy

Due to the controversial nature of some of the articles, several of its editors went to jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Ian|title=An Encyclopedia Brown story: Bound and determined to fight for the facts in the time of Trump|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/an-encyclopedia-ian-brown-story/article35586033/|accessdate=8 July 2017|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents and controversies ==

===Structure===
[[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|300px|thumb|Fig. 3: "[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]", the structure that the ''Encyclopédie'' organised knowledge into. It had three main branches: memory, reason, and imagination.]] Like most encyclopedias, the ''Encyclopédie'' attempted to collect and summarize human knowledge in a variety of fields and topics, ranging from philosophy to theology to science and the arts. The ''Encyclopédie'' was controversial for reorganizing knowledge based on [[humanism|human]] [[rationalism|reason]] instead of by nature or theology.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, pp. 7,  539&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge and intellect branched from the three categories of human thought, whereas all other perceived aspects of knowledge, including theology, were simply branches or components of these man made categories.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 1993, pp. 18–23&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction to the ''Encyclopédie'', D'Alembert's "[[Preliminary Discourse]]", is considered an important exposition of Enlightenment ideals.  Among other things, it presents a [[Figurative system of human knowledge|taxonomy of human knowledge]] (see Fig. 3), which was inspired by [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[The Advancement of Learning]]''. The three main branches of knowledge are: "Memory"/History, "Reason"/Philosophy, and "Imagination"/Poetry. This tree of knowledge was created to help readers evaluate the usefulness of the content within the ''Encyclopédie'', and to organize its content.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is the fact that theology is ordered under "Philosophy" and that "Knowledge of God" is only a few nodes away from "[[Divination]]" and "[[Black Magic]]".

===Religious and political controversies===
The authors of the ''Encyclopédie'' challenged religious authority. The authors, especially Diderot and d'Alembert, located religion within a system of reason and philosophy. They did not reject all religious claims, but believed theology and notions of [[God]] must be proven. [[Louis de Jaucourt]] therefore harshly criticized superstition as an intellectual error in his article on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 51–2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers emphasized an individual’s right to religious sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Lough, p. 196"&gt;Lough, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; They therefore doubted the authenticity of presupposed historical events cited in the Bible and questioned the validity of miracles and the Resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living story|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some contemporary scholars argue the skeptical view of miracles in the ''Encyclopédie'' may be interpreted in terms of "[[Protestant]] debates about the cessation of the charismata."&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The writers emphasized an individual’s right to religious sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Lough, p. 196"/&gt;

These challenges led to suppression from church and state authorities. The ''Encyclopédie'' and its contributors endured many attacks and attempts at censorship by the clergy or other censors, which threatened the publication of the project as well as the authors themselves. The [[Curia regis#France|King's Council]] suppressed the ''Encyclopédie'' in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&amp;artid=780 "Diderot's Encyclopedia"]. Historical Text Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]], under [[Pope Clement XIII]], placed it on its [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|list of banned books]]. Prominent intellectuals criticized it, most famously [[Jean-Jacques Lefranc, Marquis de Pompignan|Lefranc de Pompignan]] at the [[Académie française|French Academy]]. A playwright, [[Charles Palissot de Montenoy]], wrote a play called ''Les Philosophes'' to criticize the ''Encyclopédie''. When Abbé [[André Morellet]], one of the contributors to the ''Encyclopédie'', wrote a mock preface for it, he was sent to the [[Bastille]] due to allegations of libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldridge|first=Alfred Owen|title=Voltaire and the Century of Light|year=2015|publisher=Princeton Legacy Library|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEl9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To defend themselves from controversy, the encyclopedia’s articles wrote of theological topics in a mixed manner. Some articles supported orthodoxy, and some included overt criticisms of Christianity. To avoid direct retribution from censors, writers often hid criticism in obscure articles or expressed it in ironic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the contributors still openly attacked the Catholic Church in certain articles with examples including criticizing excess festivals, monasteries, and celibacy of the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, pp. 258–66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and society===
The ''Encyclopédie'' is often seen as an influence for the [[French Revolution]] because of its emphasis on Enlightenment political theories. Diderot and other authors, in famous articles such as "Political Authority", emphasized the shift of the origin of political authority from divinity or heritage to the people. This Enlightenment ideal, espoused by Rousseau and others, advocated that people have the right to consent to their government in a form of social contract.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major, contentious component of political issues in the ''Encyclopédie'' was personal or natural rights. Articles such as "Natural Rights" by Diderot explained the relationship between individuals and the general will. The natural state of humanity, according to the authors, is barbaric and unorganized. To balance the desires of individuals and the needs of the general will, humanity requires civil society and laws that benefit all persons. Writers, to varying degrees, criticized [[Thomas Hobbes]]' notions of a selfish humanity that requires a sovereign to rule over it.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, pp. 191–92&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of economics, the ''Encyclopédie'' expressed favor for [[laissez-faire]] ideals or principles of economic liberalism. Articles concerning economics or markets, such as "Economic Politics", generally favored free competition and denounced monopolies. Articles often criticized guilds as creating monopolies and approved of state intervention to remove such monopolies. The writers advocated extending laissez-faire principles of liberalism from the market to the individual level, such as with privatization of education and opening of careers to all levels of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, pp. 331–35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and technology===
At the same time, the ''Encyclopédie'' was a vast compendium of knowledge, notably on the technologies of the period, describing the traditional craft tools and processes. Much information was taken from the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et Métiers]]''. These articles applied a scientific approach to understanding the mechanical and production processes, and offered new ways to improve machines to make them more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot felt that people should have access to "useful knowledge" that they can apply to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Encyclopédie'' played an important role in the intellectual ferment leading to the French Revolution. "No encyclopaedia perhaps has been of such political importance, or has occupied so conspicuous a place in the civil and literary history of its century. It sought not only to give information, but to guide opinion," wrote the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']]. In ''The Encyclopédie and the Age of Revolution'', a work published in conjunction with a 1989 exhibition of the ''Encyclopédie'' at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], Clorinda Donato writes the following:
{{quote|The encyclopedians successfully argued and marketed their belief in the potential of reason and unified knowledge to empower human will and thus helped to shape the social issues that the French Revolution would address. Although it is doubtful whether the many artisans, technicians, or laborers whose work and presence and interspersed throughout the ''Encyclopédie'' actually read it, the recognition of their work as equal to that of intellectuals, clerics, and rulers prepared the terrain for demands for increased representation. Thus the ''Encyclopédie'' served to recognize and galvanize a new power base, ultimately contributing to the destruction of old values and the creation of new ones (12).}}

While many contributors to the ''Encyclopédie'' had no interest in radically reforming French society, the ''Encyclopédie'' as a whole pointed that way. The ''Encyclopédie'' denied that the teachings of the Catholic Church could be treated as authoritative in matters of science. The editors also refused to treat the decisions of political powers as definitive in intellectual or artistic questions. Some articles talked about changing social and political institutions that would improve their society for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Spielvogel, pp. 480–81&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Paris was the intellectual capital of Europe at the time and that many European leaders used French as their administrative language, these ideas had the capacity to spread.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The ''Encyclopédie''{{'}}s influence continues today. Historian Dan O'Sullivan compares it to [[Wikipedia]]:

{{quote|Like Wikipedia, the ''Encyclopédie'' was a collaborative effort involving numerous writers and technicians. As do [[Wikipedians]] today, Diderot and his colleagues needed to engage with the latest technology in dealing with the problems of designing an up-to-date encyclopedia. These included what kind of information to include, how to set up links between various articles, and how to achieve the maximum readership.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Quotations==
* The goal of an encyclopedia is to assemble all the knowledge scattered on the surface of the earth, to demonstrate the general system to the people with whom we live, &amp; to transmit it to the people who will come after us, so that the works of centuries past is not useless to the centuries which follow, that our descendants, by becoming more learned, may become more virtuous &amp; happier, &amp; that we do not die without having merited being part of the human race. (''Encyclopédie'', Diderot)&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"En effet, le but d'une Encyclopédie est de rassembler les connoissances éparses sur la surface de la terre; d'en exposer le système général aux hommes avec qui nous vivons, &amp; de le transmettre aux hommes qui viendront après nous; afin que les travaux des siecles passés n'aient pas été des travaux inutiles pour les siecles qui succéderont; que nos neveux, devenant plus instruits, deviennent en même tems plus vertueux &amp; plus heureux, &amp; que nous ne mourions pas sans avoir bien mérité du genre humain." From [http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1252.encyclopedie0513 uchicago.edu].&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Reason is to the philosopher what [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] is to the Christian...  Other men walk in darkness; the philosopher, who has the same passions, acts only after reflection;  he walks through the night, but it is preceded by a torch.  The philosopher forms his principles on an infinity of particular observations.  He does not confuse truth with plausibility; he takes for truth what is true, for forgery what is false, for doubtful what is doubtful, and probable what is probable.  The philosophical spirit is thus a spirit of observation and accuracy." (''Philosophers'', Dumarsais)
* "If exclusive privileges were not granted, and if the financial system would not tend to concentrate wealth, there would be few great fortunes and no quick wealth.  When the means of growing rich is divided between a greater number of citizens, wealth will also be more evenly distributed; extreme poverty and extreme wealth would be also rare." (''Wealth'', Diderot)
* "[[Urena lobata|Aguaxima]], a plant growing in Brazil and on the islands of South America. This is all that we are told about it; and I would like to know for whom such descriptions are made. It cannot be for the natives of the countries concerned, who are likely to know more about the aguaxima than is contained in this description, and who do not need to learn that the aguaxima grows in their country. It is as if you said to a Frenchman that the pear tree is a tree that grows in France, in Germany, etc. It is not meant for us either, for what do we care that there is a tree in Brazil named aguaxima, if all we know about it is its name? What is the point of giving the name? It leaves the ignorant just as they were and teaches the rest of us nothing. If all the same I mention this plant here, along with several others that are described just as poorly, then it is out of consideration for certain readers who prefer to find nothing in a dictionary article or even to find something stupid than to find no article at all." (''Aguaxima'', Diderot)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10016">'''Environmental design''' is the process of addressing surrounding environmental parameters when devising plans, programs, policies, buildings, or products. Classical prudent design may have always considered environmental factors; however, the [[environmental movement]] beginning in the 1940s has made the concept more explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Richard Plunz|last=Chermayeff | first=Serge | title=Design and the public good : selected writings, 1930-1980 | publisher=MIT Press | publication-place=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=1982 | isbn=978-0-262-16088-9 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental design can also refer to the applied arts and sciences dealing with creating the human-designed environment. These fields include [[architecture]], [[geography]], [[urban planning]], [[landscape architecture]], and [[interior design]]. Environmental design can also encompass interdisciplinary areas such as [[historical preservation]] and [[lighting]] design. In terms of a larger scope, environmental design has implications for the industrial design of products: innovative automobiles, [[wind-electricity]] generators, [[solar-electric]] equipment, and other kinds of equipment could serve as examples. Currently, the term has expanded to apply to ecological and [[sustainability]] issues.

==History==
[[File:Training meeting in a ecodesign stainless steel company in brazil.JPG|thumb|300px|right|The photo shows a training meeting with factory workers in a stainless steel [[ecodesign]] company from [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:i2amvaz.jpg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of an ancient house in the Greek city of [[Priene]]. {{deletable image-caption|Tuesday, 8 December 2009}}]] --&gt;
The first traceable concepts of environmental designs focused primarily on [[solar heating]], which began in [[Ancient Greece]] around 500 BCE. At the time, most of Greece had exhausted its supply of [[fuel wood|wood for fuel]], leading architects to design houses that would capture the [[solar energy]] of the sun.  The Greeks understood that the position of the sun varies throughout the year. For a latitude of 40 degrees in summer the sun is high in the south, at an angle of 70 degrees at the zenith, while in winter, the sun travels a lower trajectory, with a [[zenith]] of 26 degrees. Greek houses were built with south-facing façades which received little to no sun in the summer but would receive full sun in the winter, warming the house. Additionally, the southern orientation also protected the house from the colder northern winds. This clever arrangement of buildings influenced the use of the [[grid pattern]] of ancient cities. With the North-South orientation of the houses, the streets of Greek cities mainly ran East-West.

The practice of solar architecture continued with the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], who similarly had deforested much of their native [[Italian Peninsula]] by the first century BCE. The Roman ''[[heliocaminus]]'', literally 'solar furnace', functioned with the same aspects of the earlier Greek houses. The numerous public baths were oriented to the south. Roman architects added glass to windows to allow for the passage of light and to conserve interior heat as it could not escape. The Romans also used greenhouses to grow crops all year long and to cultivate the exotic plants coming from the far corners of the Empire. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote of [[greenhouse]]s that supplied the kitchen of the [[Emperor Tiberius]] during the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://habitat.aq.upm.es/boletin/n9/amvaz.html|title=Una brevísima historia de la arquitectura solar|author=|date=|journal=Boletín CF+S|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the solar orientation of buildings and the use of glass as a solar heat collector, the ancients knew other ways of harnessing solar energy. The Greeks, Romans and Chinese developed [[curved mirror]]s that could concentrate the sun's rays on an object with enough intensity to make it burn in seconds. The solar reflectors were often made of polished silver, copper or brass.

Early roots of modern environmental design began in the late 19th Century with writer/designer [[William Morris]], who rejected the use of industrialized materials and processes in wallpaper, fabrics and books his studio produced. He and others, such as [[John Ruskin]] felt that the industrial revolution would lead to harm done to nature and workers.

The narrative of Brian Danitz and Chris Zelov's documentary film ''[[Ecological Design: Inventing the Future]]'' asserts that in the decades after World War II, "The world was forced to confront the dark shadow of science and industry."  From the middle of the twentieth century, thinkers like [[Buckminster Fuller]] have acted as catalysts for a broadening and deepening of the concerns of environmental designers.  Nowadays, [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], [[appropriate technology]], [[organic horticulture]] and [[Organic agriculture|agriculture]], [[environmental restoration|land restoration]], [[New Urbanism]], and ecologically [[sustainable energy]] and waste systems are recognized considerations or options and may each find application.

By integrating renewable energy sources such as [[solar photovoltaic]], [[solar thermal]], and even [[geothermal energy]] into structures, it is possible to create [[zero emission]] buildings, where energy consumption is self-generating and non-polluting. It is also possible to construct "energy-plus buildings" which generate more energy than they consume, and the excess could then be sold to the grid. In the [[United States]], the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Green Building Rating System rates structures on their environmental sustainability.

==Environmental design and planning==
'''Environmental design and planning''' is the moniker used by several Ph.D. programs that take a multidisciplinary approach to the built environment. Typically environmental design and planning programs address architectural history or design (interior or exterior), city or regional planning, landscape architecture history or design, environmental planning, construction science, cultural geography, or historic preservation. Social science methods are frequently employed; aspects of sociology or psychology can be part of a research program.

The concept of "environmental" in these programs is quite broad and can encompass aspects of the natural, built, work, or social environments.

==Examples==
Examples of the environmental design process include use of roadway noise computer models in design of noise barriers and use of roadway air dispersion models in analyzing and designing urban highways.

Designers consciously working within this more recent framework of philosophy and practice seek a blending of nature and technology, regarding ecology as the basis for design. Some believe that strategies of conservation, stewardship, and regeneration can be applied at all levels of scale from the individual building to the community, with benefit to the human individual and local and planetary ecosystems.

Specific examples of large scale environmental design projects include:
*[[Boston Transportation Planning Review]]
*BART - [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] System Daly City Turn-back project and airport extension.
*[[Metropolitan Portland]], Oregon light rail system

A '''famine''' is a widespread scarcity of [[food]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kelly |first=James |jstor=30008004 |title=Scarcity and Poor Relief in Eighteenth-Century Ireland: The Subsistence Crisis of 1782–4 |journal=Irish Historical Studiesvolume=28 |date=May 1992 |pages=38–62 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by several factors including war, inflation, [[crop failure]], [[Demographic trap|population imbalance]], or government policies. This phenomenon is usually accompanied or followed by regional [[malnutrition]], [[starvation]], [[epidemic]], and increased [[death|mortality]]. Every inhabited continent in the world has experienced a period of famine throughout history. In the 19th and 20th century, it was generally Southeast and South Asia, as well as Eastern and Central Europe that suffered the most deaths from famine. The numbers dying from famine began to fall sharply from the 2000s.

Some countries, particularly in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], continue to have extreme cases of famine. Since 2010, Africa has been the most affected continent in the world. As of 2017, the [[United Nations]] has warned some 20 million are at risk in South Sudan, Somalia, Nigeria and [[Famine in Yemen|Yemen]]. Agricultural conditions have been fluctuating more and more due to variations in weather, and the distribution of food has been affected by conflict. Most programmes now direct their aid towards Africa.
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Definitions==
According to the [[United Nations]] humanitarian criteria, even if there are food shortages with large numbers of people lacking nutrition, a famine is declared only when certain measures of mortality, malnutrition and hunger are met. The criteria are:
*At least 20% of households in an area face extreme food shortages with a limited ability to cope
*The prevalence of acute malnutrition in children exceeds 30%
*The death rate exceeds two persons per 10,000 persons per day
The declaration of a famine carries no binding obligations on the UN or member states, but serves to focus global attention on the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39025927|title=South Sudan declares famine in Unity State|date=20 February 2017|accessdate=20 February 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Further|List of famines}}
The cyclical occurrence of famine has been a mainstay of societies engaged in [[subsistence agriculture]] since the dawn of agriculture itself. The frequency and intensity of famine has fluctuated throughout history, depending on changes in food demand, such as  [[population growth]], and supply-side shifts caused by changing [[climate|climatic]] conditions. Famine was first eliminated in Holland and England during the 17th century, due to the [[commercialization]] of agriculture and the implementation of improved techniques to increase [[crop yield]]s.

===Decline of famine===
In the 16th and 17th century, the feudal system began to break down, and more prosperous farmers began to [[enclosure|enclose]] their own land and improve their yields to sell the surplus crops for a profit. These [[capitalism|capitalist]] landowners paid their labourers with [[wage labour|money]], thereby increasing the commercialization of rural society. In the emerging competitive labour market, better techniques for the improvement of labour productivity were increasingly valued and rewarded. It was in the farmer's interest to produce as much as possible on their land in order to sell it to areas that demanded that product. They produced guaranteed [[surplus value|surpluses]] of their crop every year if they could.

Subsistence peasants were also increasingly forced to commercialize their activities because of increasing [[tax]]es. Taxes that had to be paid to central governments in money forced the peasants to produce crops to sell. Sometimes they produced [[industrial crop]]s, but they would find ways to increase their production in order to meet both their subsistence requirements as well as their tax obligations. Peasants also used the new money to purchase manufactured goods. The agricultural and social developments encouraging increased food production were gradually taking place throughout the 16th century, but took off in the early 17th century.

By the 1590s, these trends were sufficiently developed in the rich and commercialized province of [[Holland]] to allow its population to withstand a general outbreak of famine in Western Europe at that time. By that time, the [[Netherlands]] had one of the most commercialized agricultural systems in Europe. They grew many industrial crops such as [[flax]], [[hemp]] and [[hops]]. Agriculture became increasingly specialized and efficient. The efficiency of Dutch agriculture allowed for much more rapid urbanization in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries than anywhere else in Europe. As a result, productivity and wealth increased, allowing the Netherlands to maintain a steady food supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bieleman |first=Jan |url=http://www.neha.nl/publications/eshn-4/08-bieleman.pdf |title=Dutch Agriculture in the Golden Age, 1570–1660 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100401022510/http://www.neha.nl/publications/eshn-4/08-bieleman.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1650, English agriculture had also become commercialized on a much wider scale. The last peace-time famine in England was in 1623–24. There were still periods of hunger, as in the Netherlands, but no more famines ever occurred. Common areas for pasture were [[enclosure|enclosed]] for private use and large scale, efficient farms were consolidated. Other technical developments included the draining of marshes, more efficient field use patterns, and the wider introduction of industrial crops. These agricultural developments led to wider prosperity in England and increasing urbanization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curtler |first=W.H.R. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yomy8cKVOtkC |title=A Short History of English Agriculture |publisher=Etusevi Company |chapter=ch. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 17th century, English agriculture was the most productive in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burns |first=William E. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59ITUOLbVkoC |title=The Scientific Revolution: An Encyclopedia |year=2001 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both England and the Netherlands, the population stabilized between 1650 and 1750, the same time period in which the sweeping changes to agriculture occurred. Famine still occurred in other parts of [[Europe]], however. In [[East Europe]], famines occurred as late as the twentieth century.

===Attempts at famine alleviation===
[[File:Skibbereen by James Mahony, 1847.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Skibbereen]], Ireland, during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]], 1847 illustration by [[James Mahony]] for the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'']]

Because of the severity of famine, it was a chief concern for governments and other authorities. In pre-industrial Europe, preventing famine, and ensuring timely food supplies, was one of the chief concerns of many governments, although they were severely limited in their options due to limited levels of external trade and an infrastructure and bureaucracy generally too rudimentary to effect real relief. Most governments were concerned by famine because it could lead to [[revolt]] and other forms of social disruption.

By the mid-19th century and the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], it became possible for governments to alleviate the effects of famine through [[price controls]], large scale importation of food products from foreign markets, stockpiling, [[rationing]], regulation of production and [[charity (practice)|charity]]. The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine of 1845]] in Ireland was one of the first famines to feature such intervention, although the government response was often lacklustre. The initial response of the British government to the early phase of the famine was "prompt and relatively successful," according to [[F. S. L. Lyons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ireland since the famine |first=Francis Stewart Leland |last=Lyons |publisher=Fontana |year=1973 |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confronted by widespread crop failure in the autumn of 1845, Prime Minister [[Robert Peel|Sir Robert Peel]] purchased £100,000 worth of maize and [[cornmeal]] secretly from America. [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers &amp; Co]] initially acted as purchasing agents for the Prime Minister. The government hoped that they would not "stifle private enterprise" and that their actions would not act as a disincentive to local relief efforts. Due to weather conditions, the first shipment did not arrive in Ireland until the beginning of February 1846.{{sfn|Kinealy|1995|p=38}} The maize corn was then re-sold for a penny a pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Disraeli |last=Blake |first=Robert |lccn=67011837 |series=University paperbacks |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QpRnAAAAMAAJ |year=1967 |publisher=St. Martin's Press |page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Peel moved to repeal the [[Corn Laws]], [[tariff]]s on grain which kept the price of bread artificially high. The famine situation worsened during 1846 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in that year did little to help the starving Irish; the measure split the Conservative Party, leading to the fall of Peel's ministry.{{sfn|Blake|1967|pp=221–41}} In March, Peel set up a programme of public works in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Great Hunger |first=Cecil |last=Woodham-Smith |year=1962 |pages=78–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Famine in India Natives Waiting for Relief in Bangalore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|People waiting for famine relief in [[Bangalore]] From the ''[[Illustrated London News]]'', 1877]]

Despite this promising start, the measures undertaken by Peel's successor, [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], proved comparatively "inadequate" as the crisis deepened. Russell's ministry introduced public works projects, which by December 1846 employed some half million Irish and proved impossible to administer. The government was influenced by a [[laissez-faire]] belief that the market would provide the food needed. It halted government food and relief works, and turned to a mixture of "indoor" and "outdoor" direct relief; the former administered in [[workhouse]]s through the [[Irish Poor Laws|Poor Law]], the latter through [[soup kitchen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Ireland: History of a Nation |first=David |last=Ross |year=2002 |publisher=New Lanark: Geddes &amp; Grosset |isbn=1-84205-164-4 |pages=224, 311}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A systematic attempt at creating the necessary regulatory framework for dealing with famine was developed by the [[British Raj]] in the 1880s. In order to comprehensively address the issue of famine, the British created an Indian Famine commission to recommend steps that the government would be required to take in the event of a famine.&lt;ref name="L.

The famine code was also one of the first attempts to scientifically predict famine in order to mitigate its effects. These were finally passed into law in 1883 under [[George Robinson, 1st Marquess of Ripon|Lord Ripon]].

The [[Indian Famine Codes|Code]] introduced the first [[famine scale]]: three levels of [[food insecurity]] were defined: near-scarcity, scarcity, and famine.  "Scarcity" was defined as three successive years of [[crop failure]], [[crop yield]]s of one-third or one-half normal, and large populations in distress. "Famine" further included a rise in food prices above 140% of "normal", the movement of people in search of food, and widespread mortality.&lt;ref name="L. Brennan"&gt;{{Citation |last=Brennan |first=L |year=1984 |contribution=The development of the India Famine Codes: personalities, policies and politics |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FoNS2fM8N0kC |editor-last=Currey |editor-first=Bruce |editor2-last=Hugo |editor2-first=Graeme |title=Famine as a geographical phenomenon |edition=Illustrated |series=GeoJournal library |publisher=Springer |volume=Volume 1 |pages=91–110 |isbn=90-277-1762-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission identified that the loss of wages from lack of employment of agricultural labourers and artisans were the cause of famines. The Famine Code applied a strategy of generating employment for these sections of the population and relied on open-ended public works to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Hunger and Public Action |last1=Drèze |first1=Jean |last2=Sen |first2=Amartya Kumar |isbn=978-0-19-828365-2 |lccn=89025504 |series=Studies in Development Economics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OjCHQR-M0ocC |year=1991 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford; New York |authorlink1=Jean Drèze |authorlink2=Amartya Sen |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
During the 20th century, an estimated 70 million people died from [[List of famines|famines across the world]], of whom an estimated 30 million died during the [[Three Years of Natural Disasters|famine of 1958–61]] in [[China]].&lt;ref name=IDSWorkingPaper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/wp105.pdf|

[[File:Feed The World Logo.GIF|thumb|Feed The World logo designed for [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]].]]
A few of the great famines of the late 20th century were: the [[Biafra|Biafran famine]] in the 1960s, the [[Khmer Rouge]]-caused famine in [[Cambodia]] in the 1970s, the [[North Korea]]n [[North Korean famine|famine of the 1990s]] and the [[Ethiopia]]n [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia|famine of 1983–85]].

The latter event was reported on television reports around the world, carrying footage of starving [[Ethiopia]]ns whose plight was centered around a feeding station near the town of [[Korem]]. This stimulated the first mass movements to end famine across the world.

[[BBC]] newsreader [[Michael Buerk]] gave moving commentary of the tragedy on 23 October 1984, which he described as a "biblical famine". This prompted the [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]] single, which was organized by [[Bob Geldof]] and featured more than 20 pop stars. The [[Live Aid]] concerts in [[London]] and [[Philadelphia]] raised even more funds for the cause. Hundreds of thousands of people died within one year as a result of the famine, but the publicity Live Aid generated encouraged Western nations to make available enough surplus grain to end the immediate hunger crisis in Africa.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/live-aid-concert|title=Live Aid concert - Jul 13, 1985 - HISTORY.com|work=HISTORY.com|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==21st century==
Until 2017, worldwide deaths from famine had been falling dramatically. The [[World Peace Foundation]] reported that from the 1870s to the 1970s, great famines killed an average of 928,000 people a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.tufts.edu/wpf/famine/|title=Famine Trends Dataset, Tables and Graphs – World Peace Foundation|website=sites.tufts.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1980, annual deaths had dropped to an average of 75,000, less than 10% of what they had been until the 1970s. That reduction was achieved despite the approximately 150,000 lives lost in the [[2011 East Africa drought|2011 Somalia famine]]. Yet in 2017, the [[UN]] officially declared famine had returned to Africa, with about 20 million people at risk of death from starvation in Nigeria, in [[2017 South Sudan famine|South Sudan]], in [[Famine in Yemen|Yemen]], and in [[2017 Somalian drought|Somalia]].&lt;ref name = "democracyFT"/&gt;

{{category see also|Famines in Africa}}
;Early history
In the mid-22nd century BC, a sudden and short-lived climatic change that caused reduced rainfall resulted in several decades of drought in [[Upper Egypt]]. The resulting famine and civil strife is believed to have been a major cause of the collapse of the [[Old Kingdom]].
An account from the [[First Intermediate Period]] states, "All of Upper Egypt was dying of hunger and people were eating their children." In 1680s, famine extended across the entire [[Sahel]], and in 1738 half the population of [[Timbuktu]] died of famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/desclim.html |title=Len Milich: Anthropogenic Desertification vs 'Natural' Climate Trends |website=Ag.arizona.edu |date=10 August 1997 |accessdate=1 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211081648/http://ag.arizona.edu/~lmilich/desclim.html |archivedate=11 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Egypt]], between 1687 and 1731, there were six famines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Quataert |first=Donald |title=The Ottoman Empire, 1700–1922 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-521-83910-6 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The famine that afflicted Egypt in 1784 cost it roughly one-sixth of its population.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/11/061121232204.htm Icelandic Volcano Caused Historic Famine In Egypt, Study Shows]".

According to John Iliffe, "Portuguese records of [[Angola]] from the 16th century show that a great famine occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys."&lt;ref&gt;John Iliffe (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Africans: the history of a continent''].

The first documentation of weather in West-Central Africa occurs around the mid-16th to 17th centuries in areas such as Luanda Kongo, however, not much data was recorded on the issues of weather and disease except for a few notable documents. The only records obtained are of violence between Portuguese and Africans during the [[Battle of Mbilwa]] in 1665. In these documents the Portuguese wrote of African raids on Portuguese merchants solely for food, giving clear signs of famine. Additionally, instances of [[cannibalism]] by the African Jaga were also more prevalent during this time frame, indicating an extreme deprivation of a primary food source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Joseph C. |title=The Significance of Drought, Disease and Famine in the Agriculturally Marginal Zones of West-Central Africa |journal=Journal of African History |date=January 1982 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=17–61 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=3243140&amp;jid=AFH&amp;volumeId=23&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=3243132 |accessdate=11 November 2011 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700020235 |pmid=11632226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable period of famine occurred around the turn of the 20th century in the [[Congo Free State]].

The introduction of cash crops such as [[cotton]], and forcible measures to impel farmers to grow these crops, sometimes impoverished the peasantry in many areas, such as northern Nigeria, contributing to greater vulnerability to famine when severe drought struck in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Papaioannou |first=Kostadis J. |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629815000578 |title=Climate shocks and conflict: Evidence from colonial Nigeria |journal=Political Geography |volume=50 |date=January 2016 |pages=33–47 |publisher=Elsevier |doi=10.1016/j.polgeo.2015.07.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large-scale famine occurred in [[Ethiopia]] in 1888 and succeeding years, as the [[1890s African rinderpest epizootic|rinderpest epizootic]], introduced into [[Eritrea]] by infected cattle, spread southwards reaching ultimately as far as [[South Africa]]. In Ethiopia it was estimated that as much as 90 percent of the national herd died, rendering rich farmers and herders destitute overnight. This coincided with [[drought]] associated with an el Nino oscillation, human epidemics of [[smallpox]], and in several countries, intense [[war]]. The [[Famines in Ethiopia|Ethiopian Great famine]] that afflicted Ethiopia from 1888 to 1892 cost it roughly one-third of its population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/ijas/ijasno2/georgis.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911102037/http://www.ccb.ucar.edu/ijas/ijasno2/georgis.html |date=11 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Sudan]] the year 1888 is remembered as the worst famine in history, on account of these factors and also the exactions imposed by the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist state]].

Records compiled for the [[Himba people|Himba]] recall two droughts from 1910 to 1917. They were recorded by the Himba through a method of [[oral tradition]]. From 1910 to 1911 the Himba described the drought as "drought of the omutati seed" also called ''omangowi'', which means the fruit of an unidentified vine that people ate during the time period. From 1914 to 1916 droughts brought ''katur' ombanda'' or ''kari' ombanda'' which means "the time of eating clothing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=Joseph C. |title=The Significance of Drought, Disease and Famine in the Agriculturally Marginal Zones of West-Central Africa |journal=Journal of African History |date=January 1982 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=17–61 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayFulltext?type=1&amp;fid=3243140&amp;jid=AFH&amp;volumeId=23&amp;issueId=01&amp;aid=3243132 |accessdate=27 November 2011 |doi=10.1017/S0021853700020235 |pmid=11632226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the middle part of the 20th century, agriculturalists, economists and geographers did not consider Africa to be especially famine prone. From 1870 to 2010, 87 per cent of deaths from famine occurred in Asia and Eastern Europe, with only 9.2 per cent in Africa.&lt;ref name = "democracyFT"&gt;{{Cite news

Although the drought was brief the main cause of death in Rwanda was due to Belgian prerogatives to acquisition grain from their colony (Rwanda). The increased grain acquisition was related to WW2. This and the drought caused 300,000 Rwandans to perish.&lt;ref name="Masci 2002"/&gt;

From 1967 to 1969 large scale famine occurred in Biafra and Nigeria due to a [[Nigerian Civil War|government blockade of the Breakaway territory]]. It is estimated that 1.5 million people died of starvation due to this famine. Additionally, drought and other government interference with the food supply caused 500 thousand Africans to perish in Central and West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iliffe |first=John |title=Africans: The History of a Continent |year=1995 |publisher=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine recurred in the early 1970s, when [[Ethiopia]] and the west African [[Sahel]] suffered [[Sahel drought|drought and famine]]. The Ethiopian famine of that time was closely linked to the crisis of feudalism in that country, and in due course helped to bring about the downfall of the Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. The Sahelian famine was associated with the slowly growing crisis of pastoralism in Africa, which has seen livestock herding decline as a viable way of life over the last two generations.

[[File:Starved girl.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|A girl during the [[Nigerian Civil War]] of the late 1960s. Pictures of the famine caused by Nigerian blockade garnered sympathy for the Biafrans worldwide.]]
Famines occurred in [[Sudan]] in the late-1970s and again in 1990 and 1998. The 1980 famine in [[Karamoja]], [[Uganda]] was, in terms of mortality rates, one of the worst in history. 21% of the population died, including 60% of the infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unu.edu/unupress/food/8F091e/8F091E05.htm|title=Food and bulletin volume 9, number 1, march 1987|website=www.unu.edu|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, large scale multilayer drought occurred in the Sudan and Sahelian regions of Africa. This caused famine because even though the Sudanese Government believed there was a surplus of grain, there were local deficits across the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=BE |first=Spiers |title=Famine in Africa |url=http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9110094&amp;q=Famine+in+Africa&amp;uid=791203203&amp;setcookie=yes |accessdate=27 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823070354/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9110094&amp;q=Famine+in+Africa&amp;uid=791203203&amp;setcookie=yes |archivedate=23 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1984, television reports describing the Ethiopian famine as "biblical", prompted the [[Live Aid]] concerts in [[London]] and [[Philadelphia]], which raised large sums to alleviate the suffering. A primary cause of the famine (one of the largest seen in the country) is that Ethiopia (and the surrounding Horn) was still recovering from the droughts which occurred in the mid-late 1970s. Compounding this problem was the intermittent fighting due to [[Ethiopian civil war|civil war]], the [[Derg|government]]'s lack of organization in providing relief, and hoarding of supplies to control the population. Ultimately, over 1 million Ethiopians died and over 22 million people suffered due to the prolonged drought, which lasted roughly 2 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethiopia in Crisis: Famine and Its Aftermath 1984–1988|url=http://countrystudies.us/ethiopia/35.htm|publisher=U.S. Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Somalia became a war zone with no effective government, police, or basic services after the collapse of the dictatorship led by [[Siad Barre]] and the split of power between warlords. This coincided with a massive drought, causing over 300,000 Somalis to perish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Masci |first=David |title=Famine In Africa |journal=CQ Researcher |date=8 November 2002 |volume=12 |issue=39 |url=http://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre2002110800#top}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Recent years

Since the start of the 21st century, more effective early warning and humanitarian response actions have reduced the number of deaths by famine markedly. That said, many African countries are not self-sufficient in food production, relying on income from [[cash crop]]s to import food. [[Agriculture]] in Africa is susceptible to [[climate|climatic]] fluctuations, especially [[drought]]s which can reduce the amount of food produced locally. Other agricultural problems include [[Soil fertility|soil infertility]], [[land degradation]] and [[erosion]], swarms of [[desert locust]]s, which can destroy whole crops, and livestock diseases. [[Desertification]] is increasingly problematic: the [[Sahara]] reportedly spreads up to {{convert|30|mi|km|0|order=flip}} per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0801/p01s02-woaf.html |title=Hunger is spreading in Africa |website=CSMonitor.com |date=1 August 2005 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most serious famines have been caused by a combination of drought, misguided economic policies, and conflict. The 1983–85 famine in Ethiopia, for example, was the outcome of all these three factors, made worse by the Communist government's censorship of the emerging crisis. In Sudan at the same date, drought and economic crisis combined with denials of any food shortage by the then-government of President [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], to create a crisis that killed perhaps 250,000 people—and helped bring about a popular uprising that overthrew Nimeiry.

Numerous factors make the [[food security]] situation in Africa tenuous, including political instability, armed conflict and [[civil war]], [[political corruption|corruption]] and mismanagement in handling food supplies, and trade policies that harm African agriculture. An example of a famine created by human rights abuses is the [[1998 Sudan famine]]. [[AIDS]] is also having long-term economic effects on agriculture by reducing the available workforce, and is creating new vulnerabilities to famine by overburdening poor households. On the other hand, in the modern history of Africa on quite a few occasions famines acted as a major source of acute political instability.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Daria Khaltourina]] ''[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=165&amp;Itemid=70 Secular Cycles and Millennial Trends in Africa]''. Moscow: Russia, 2006.  {{ISBN|5-484-00560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Africa]], if current trends of [[population growth]] and [[soil retrogression and degradation|soil degradation]] continue, the continent might
be able to feed just 25% of its population by 2025, according to [[United Nations University]] (UNU)'s Ghana-based Institute for Natural Resources in Africa.&lt;ref name="news.mongabay.com"/&gt;

Today, famine is most widespread in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], but with exhaustion of food resources, overdrafting of [[groundwater]], wars, internal struggles, and economic failure, famine continues to be a worldwide problem with hundreds of millions of people suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Christian Science Monitor  |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0724/p01s01-wogi.html |title=Rising food prices curb aid to global poor |date=24 July 2007 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; These famines cause widespread malnutrition and impoverishment. The [[1984–1985 famine in Ethiopia|famine in Ethiopia]] in the 1980s had an immense death toll, although Asian famines of the 20th century have also produced extensive death tolls. Modern African famines are characterized by widespread destitution and malnutrition, with heightened mortality confined to young children.

;Current initiatives
Against a backdrop of conventional interventions through the state or markets, alternative initiatives have been pioneered to address the problem of food security. One pan-African example is the [[Great Green Wall]]. Another example is the "Community Area-Based Development Approach" to agricultural development ("CABDA"), an NGO programme with the objective of providing an alternative approach to increasing food security in Africa. CABDA proceeds through specific areas of intervention such as the introduction of drought-resistant crops and new methods of food production such as agro-forestry. Piloted in [[Ethiopia]] in the 1990s it has spread to [[Malawi]], [[Uganda]], [[Eritrea]] and [[Kenya]]. In an analysis of the programme by the [[Overseas Development Institute]], CABDA's focus on individual and community capacity-building is highlighted. This enables farmers to influence and drive their own development through community-run institutions, bringing food security to their household and region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The role of African Unity organization===
The organization of African unity and its role in the African crisis has been interested in the political aspects of the continent, especially the liberation of the occupied parts of it and the elimination of racism. The organization has succeeded in this area but the economic field and development has not succeeded in these fields. African leaders have agreed to waive the role of their organization in the development to the United Nations through the Economic Commission for Africa "ECA".&lt;ref&gt;Al-Kout, Bashir.

These events are comparable, though somewhat smaller in scale, to the ecological trigger events of China's vast 19th-century famines.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre-Etienne Will, ''Bureaucracy and Famine''&lt;/ref&gt; Qing China carried out its relief efforts, which included vast shipments of food, a requirement that the rich open their storehouses to the poor, and price regulation, as part of a state guarantee of subsistence to the peasantry (known as ''ming-sheng'').

When a stressed monarchy shifted from state management and direct shipments of grain to monetary charity in the mid-19th century, the system broke down. Thus the 1867–68 famine under the [[Tongzhi Restoration]] was successfully relieved but the [[Northern Chinese Famine of 1876–1879|Great North China Famine]] of 1877–78, caused by drought across northern China, was a catastrophe. The province of [[Shanxi]] was substantially depopulated as grains ran out, and desperately starving people stripped forests, fields, and their very houses for food. Estimated mortality is 9.5 to 13 million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/U8480E/U8480E05.htm Dimensions of need&amp;nbsp;– People and populations at risk].

;Great Leap Forward
The [[Great Chinese Famine|largest famine of the 20th century]], and almost certainly of all time, was the 1958–61 [[Great Leap Forward]] famine in China. The immediate causes of this famine lay in Mao Zedong's ill-fated attempt to transform China from an agricultural nation to an industrial power in one huge leap. Communist Party cadres across China insisted that peasants abandon their farms for collective farms, and begin to produce steel in small foundries, often melting down their farm instruments in the process. Collectivisation undermined incentives for the investment of labor and resources in agriculture; unrealistic plans for decentralized metal production sapped needed labor; unfavorable weather conditions; and communal dining halls encouraged overconsumption of available food.&lt;ref&gt;Chang, G, and Wen, G (1997), "[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Communal%20dining%20and%20the%20Chinese%20Famine%201958-1961&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Search Communal dining and the Chinese Famine 1958–1961]"&lt;/ref&gt; Such was the centralized control of information and the intense pressure on party cadres to report only good news—such as [[production quota]]s met or exceeded—that information about the escalating disaster was effectively suppressed. When the leadership did become aware of the scale of the famine, it did little to respond, and continued to ban any discussion of the cataclysm. This blanket suppression of news was so effective that very few Chinese citizens were aware of the scale of the famine, and the greatest peacetime demographic disaster of the 20th century only became widely known twenty years later, when the veil of censorship began to lift.

The exact number of famine deaths during 1958–61 is difficult to determine, and estimates range from 18&lt;ref name=grada9&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gráda |first=Cormac Ó |title=Great Leap into Famine |series=UCD Centre For Economic Research Working Paper Series |year=2011 |page=9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to at least 42 million&lt;ref name=dikotterxii&gt;Dikötter, Frank.

;Khmer Rouge
[[File:Choeungek2.JPG|thumb|Skulls of [[Khmer Rouge]] murder victims at [[Choeung Ek]]]]
In 1975, the [[Khmer Rouge]] took control of [[Cambodia]]. The new government was led by [[Pol Pot]], who desired to turn Cambodia into a communist, agrarian utopia. His regime emptied the cities, abolished currency and private property, and forced Cambodia's population into slavery on communal farms. In less than four years, the Khmer Rouge had executed nearly 1.4 million people, mostly those believed to be a threat to the new ideology.

Due to the failure of the Khmer Rouge's agrarian reform policies, Cambodia experienced widespread famine. As many as one million more died from starvation, disease, and exhaustion resulting from these policies.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, William, ''The Quality of Mercy: Cambodia, Holocaust and Modern Conscience'', Touchstone, 1985, pp. 115–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kaplan"&gt;Kaplan, Robert D., ''The Ends of the Earth'', Vintage, 1996, p. 406.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 [[Vietnam]] invaded Cambodia and removed the Khmer Rouge from power.

This [[Autarky|autarkic]] [[Urban area|urban]], industrial state depended on massive inputs of subsidised goods, including fossil fuels, primarily from the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[People's Republic of China]]. When the Soviet collapse and China's marketization switched trade to a hard currency, full-price basis, North Korea's economy collapsed. The vulnerable agricultural sector experienced a massive failure in 1995–96, expanding to full-fledged famine by 1996–99.

Estimates based on the North Korean census suggest that 240,000 to 420,000 people died as a result of the famine and that there were 600,000 to 850,000 unnatural deaths in North Korea from 1993 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spoorenberg |first1=Thomas |last2=Schwekendiek |first2=Daniel |title=Demographic Changes in North Korea: 1993–2008 |journal=Population and Development Review |volume=38 |issue=1 |date=March 2012 |pages=133–58 |doi=10.1111/j.1728-4457.2012.00475.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korea has not yet regained food self-sufficiency and relies on external [[food aid]] from [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Russia]] and the [[United States]].

{{Main|Famine in India}}
{{See also|Timeline of major famines in India during British rule}}
Owing to its almost entire dependence upon the [[monsoon]] rains, [[India]] is vulnerable to crop failures, which upon occasion deepen into famine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Famine |display=Famine § Famines in India |volume=10 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were 14 famines in [[History of India|India]] between the 11th and 17th centuries (Bhatia, 1985). For example, during the 1022–1033 Great famines in India entire provinces were depopulated. Famine in [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] killed at least two million people in 1702–1704. B.M. Bhatia believes that the earlier famines were localised, and it was only after 1860, during the [[British Raj|British rule]], that famine came to signify general shortage of foodgrains in the country. There were approximately 25 major famines spread through states such as [[Tamil Nadu]] in the south, and [[Bihar]] and [[Bengal]] in the east during the latter half of the 19th century.

[[File:India-famine-family-crop-420.jpg|thumb|Victims of the Great Famine of 1876–78 in India during British rule, pictured in 1877.]]
[[Romesh Chunder Dutt]] argued as early as 1900, and present-day scholars such as [[Amartya Sen]] agree, that some historic famines were a product of both uneven rainfall and British economic and administrative policies, which since 1857 had led to the seizure and conversion of local farmland to foreign-owned plantations, restrictions on internal trade, heavy taxation of Indian citizens to support British expeditions in [[Afghanistan]] (see [[European influence in Afghanistan#Second Anglo-Afghan War|The Second Anglo-Afghan War]]), inflationary measures that increased the price of food, and substantial exports of staple crops from India to Britain. (Dutt, 1900 and 1902; Srivastava, 1968; Sen, 1982; Bhatia, 1985.)

Some British citizens, such as [[William Digby (writer)|William Digby]], agitated for policy reforms and famine relief, but [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]], the governing British viceroy in India, opposed such changes in the belief that they would stimulate shirking by Indian workers. The first, the [[Bengal famine of 1770]], is estimated to have taken around 10 million lives—one-third of Bengal's population at the time. Other notable famines include the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]], in which 6.1 million to 10.3 million people died&lt;ref name=mikedavis7&gt;Davis, Mike. ''[[Late Victorian Holocausts]]''. 1.

The observations of the Famine Commission of 1880 support the notion that food distribution is more to blame for famines than food scarcity. They observed that each province in British India, including [[Burma]], had a surplus of foodgrains, and the annual surplus was 5.16 million tons (Bhatia, 1970). At that time, annual export of rice and other grains from India was approximately one million tons.

{{cquote|Population growth worsened the plight of the peasantry. As a result of peace and improved sanitation and health, the Indian population rose from perhaps 100 million in 1700 to 300 million by 1920. While encouraging agricultural productivity, the British also provided economic incentives to have more children to help in the fields. Although a similar population increase occurred in Europe at the same time, the growing numbers could be absorbed by industrialization or emigration to the Americas and Australia. India enjoyed neither an industrial revolution nor an increase in food growing. Moreover, Indian landlords had a stake in the cash crop system and discouraged innovation. As a result, population numbers far outstripped the amount of available food and land, creating dire poverty and widespread hunger.|20x|20x|-Craig A.

The [[Great Famine of 1315–1317]] (or to 1322) was the first major food crisis to strike Europe in the 14th century. Millions in northern Europe died over an extended number of years, marking a clear end to the earlier period of growth and prosperity during the 11th and 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=R688at3KskQC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Story of Ireland]''.

Most nobles, cities, and states were slow to respond to the crisis and when they realized its severity, they had little success in securing food for their people. In 1315, in Norfolk England, the price of grain soared from 5 shillings/quarter to 20 shillings/quarter.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=o8ea33eCFQgC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;dq=great+wave+great+famine+inflation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQsO3RzPbWAhWT3oMKHXv-Bb4Q6AEIJTAA#v=snippet&amp;q=1315&amp;f=false] David Hackett Fisher The Great Wave p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine was a very destabilizing and devastating occurrence. The prospect of [[starvation]] led people to take desperate measures. When scarcity of food became apparent to peasants, they would sacrifice long-term prosperity for short-term survival. They would kill their [[draught animal]]s, leading to lowered production in subsequent years. They would eat their [[seed]] corn, sacrificing next year's crop in the hope that more seed could be found. Once those means had been exhausted, they would take to the road in search of food. They migrated to the cities where merchants from other areas would be more likely to sell their food, as cities had a stronger purchasing power than did rural areas. Cities also administered relief programs and bought grain for their populations so that they could keep order. With the confusion and desperation of the migrants, [[crime]] would often follow them. Many peasants resorted to [[bandit]]ry in order to acquire enough to eat.

One famine would often lead to difficulties in the following years because of lack of seed stock or disruption of routine, or perhaps because of less-available labour. Famines were often interpreted as signs of [[God]]'s displeasure. They were seen as the removal, by God, of His gifts to the people of the Earth. Elaborate religious processions and rituals were made to prevent God's wrath in the form of famine.

;16th century
[[File:Goya-Guerra (59).jpg|thumb|An engraving from [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'s ''[[Disasters of War]]'', showing starving women, doubtless inspired by the terrible famine that struck [[Madrid]] in 1811–1812.]]
During the 15th century to the 18th century, famines in Europe became more frequent due to the [[Little Ice Age]]. The colder climate resulted in harvest failures and shortfalls that led to a rise in [[conspiracy theories]] concerning the causes behind these famines, such as the [[Pacte de Famine]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Steven. ''The Famine Plot Persuasion in Eighteenth-Century France''. Pennsylvania: Diane Publishing Co, 1982. {{ISBN|0-87169-723-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1590s saw the worst famines in centuries across all of Europe. Famine had been relatively rare during the 16th century. The economy and population had grown steadily as subsistence populations tend to when there is an extended period of relative peace (most of the time). Although peasants in areas of high population density, such as northern Italy, had learned to increase the yields of their lands through techniques such as promiscuous culture, they were still quite vulnerable to famines, forcing them to work their land even more intensively.

The great famine of the 1590s began a period of famine and decline in the 17th century. The price of grain, all over Europe was high, as was the population. Various types of people were vulnerable to the succession of bad harvests that occurred throughout the 1590s in different regions. The increasing number of wage labourers in the countryside were vulnerable because they had no food of their own, and their meager living was not enough to purchase the expensive grain of a bad-crop year. Town labourers were also at risk because their wages would be insufficient to cover the cost of grain, and, to make matters worse, they often received less money in bad-crop years since the disposable income of the wealthy was spent on grain. Often, unemployment would be the result of the increase in grain prices, leading to ever-increasing numbers of urban poor.

All areas of Europe were badly affected by the famine in these periods, especially rural areas. The Netherlands was able to escape most of the damaging effects of the famine, though the 1590s were still difficult years there. [[Amsterdam]]'s grain trade with the [[Baltic region|Baltic]], guaranteed a food supply.

;17th century
The years around 1620 saw another period of famine sweep across Europe. These famines were generally less severe than the famines of twenty-five years earlier, but they were nonetheless quite serious in many areas. Perhaps the worst famine since 1600, the great famine in [[Finland]] in 1696, killed one-third of the population.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/nehapfin.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009053403/http://www.euro.who.int/document/peh-ehp/nehapfin.pdf |date=9 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Devastating harvest failures afflicted the northern [[Italy|Italian]] economy from 1618 to 1621, and it did not recover fully for centuries. There were serious famines in the late-1640s and less severe ones in the 1670s throughout northern Italy.

Over two million people died in two famines in [[France]] between 1693 and 1710. Both famines were made worse by ongoing wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ó Gráda |first=Cormac |last2=Chevet |first2=Jean-Michel |year=2002 |title=Famine And Market In ''Ancient Régime'' France |journal=The Journal of Economic History |pmid=17494233 |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=706–33 |doi=10.1017/S0022050702001055 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=122547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 872 days of the [[Siege of Leningrad]] (1941–1944) caused unparalleled famine in the Leningrad region through disruption of utilities, water, energy and food supplies. This resulted in the deaths of about one million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=24841 |title=The Moscow Times&amp;nbsp;— News, Business, Culture &amp; Multimedia from Russia |website=Sptimes.ru |date= |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Famine even struck in Western Europe during the [[Second World War]]. In the [[Netherlands]], the ''[[Dutch famine of 1944|Hongerwinter]]'' of 1944 killed approximately 30,000 people. Some other areas of Europe also experienced famine at the same time.

Beginning in the 20th century, nitrogen [[fertilizer]]s, new [[pesticide]]s, [[desert farming]], and other agricultural technologies began to be used to increase food production, in part to combat famine. Between 1950 and 1984, as the [[Green Revolution]] influenced [[agriculture]], world grain production increased by 250%.  Developed nations have shared these technologies with developing nations with a famine problem. However, as early as 1995, there were signs that these new developments may contribute to the decline of arable land (e.g. persistence of pesticides leading to [[soil contamination]], [[Soil salinity|salt accumulation due to irrigation]], [[erosion]]).

In 1994, David Pimentel, professor of ecology and [[agriculture]] at [[Cornell University]], and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), estimated the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million.&lt;ref&gt;David Pimentel, Mario Giampietro 1994.

According to geologist [[Dale Allen Pfeiffer]], coming decades could see rising [[food]] prices without relief and massive [[starvation]] on a global level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/2225|title=The Oil Drum: Europe&amp;nbsp;— Agriculture Meets Peak Oil: Soil Association Conference|website=Europe.theoildurm.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Water deficits]], which are already spurring heavy [[grain]] imports in numerous smaller countries, may soon do the same in larger countries, such as [[China]] or [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HG21Df01.html|title=Asia Times Online: South Asia news&amp;nbsp;— India grows a grain crisis|website=Atimes.com|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The water tables are falling in many countries (including Northern China, the US, and India) due to widespread overconsumption. Other countries affected include [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], and [[Mexico]]. This will eventually lead to [[water scarcity]] and cutbacks in grain harvest. Even while overexploiting its [[aquifers]], China has developed a [[grain]] deficit, contributing to the upward pressure on grain prices. Most of the three billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing [[water shortages]].

After [[China]] and [[India]], there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits&amp;nbsp;– [[Algeria]], [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Mexico]], and [[Pakistan]]. Four of these already import a large share of their grain. Only Pakistan remains marginally self-sufficient.

Evan Fraser, a geographer at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]], Canada, explores the ways in which [[climate change]] may affect future famines.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E. 2007a. Travelling in antique lands: Studying past famines to understand present vulnerabilities to climate change. Climate Change 83:495–514.&lt;/ref&gt; To do this, he draws on a range of historic cases where relatively small environmental problems triggered famines as a way of creating theoretical links between climate and famine in the future.  Drawing on situations as diverse as the [[Great Irish Potato Famine]],&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E. 2003. Social vulnerability and ecological fragility: building bridges between social and natural sciences using the Irish Potato Famine as a case study. Conservation Ecology 7:9 (online).&lt;/ref&gt; a series of weather induced famines in [[Asia]] during the late 19th century, and famines in Ethiopia during the 1980s, he concludes there are three "lines of defense" that protect a community's [[food security]] from [[environmental change]]. The first line of defense is the [[Agroecosystem|agro-ecosystem]] on which food is produced: diverse ecosystems with well managed soils high in [[organic matter]] tend to be more resilient. The second line of defense is the wealth and skills of individual households: If those households affected by bad weather such as [[drought]] have savings or skills they may be able to do all right despite the bad weather.  The final line of defense is created by the formal institutions present in a society.  Governments, churches, or NGOs must be willing and able to mount effective relief efforts. Pulling this together, Evan Fraser argues that if an [[ecosystem]] is resilient enough, it may be able to withstand weather-related shocks. But if these shocks overwhelm the ecosystem's line of defense, it is necessary for the household to adapt using its skills and savings. If a problem is too big for the family or household, then people must rely on the third line of defense, which is whether or not the formal institutions present in a society are able to provide help. Evan Fraser concludes that in almost every situation where an environmental problem triggered a famine you see a failure in each of these three lines of defense.&lt;ref name="Fraser2006"&gt;Fraser, E.

Definitions of famines are based on three different categories—these include food supply-based, food consumption-based and mortality-based definitions. Some definitions of famines are:
* Blix&amp;nbsp;– Widespread food shortage leading to significant rise in regional death rates.{{sfn|Blix|Svensk näringsforskning|1971|p=}}
* Brown and Eckholm&amp;nbsp;– Sudden, sharp reduction in food supply resulting in widespread hunger.{{sfn|Brown|Eckholm|1974|p=}}
* Scrimshaw&amp;nbsp;– Sudden collapse in level of food consumption of large numbers of people.{{sfn|Scrimshaw|1987|p=}}
* Ravallion&amp;nbsp;– Unusually high mortality with unusually severe threat to food intake of some segments of a population.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=2}}
* Cuny&amp;nbsp;– A set of conditions that occurs when large numbers of people in a region cannot obtain sufficient food, resulting in widespread, acute malnutrition.{{sfn|Cuny|1999|p=}}

Food shortages in a population are caused either by a lack of food or by difficulties in food distribution; it may be worsened by natural climate fluctuations and by extreme political conditions related to oppressive government or warfare. The conventional explanation until 1981 for the cause of famines was the Food availability decline (FAD) hypothesis. The assumption was that the central cause of all famines was a decline in food availability.{{sfn|Encyclopædia Britannica|2010|p=}} However, FAD could not explain why only a certain section of the population such as the agricultural laborer was affected by famines while others were insulated from famines.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} Based on the studies of some recent famines, the decisive role of FAD has been questioned and it has been suggested that the causal mechanism for precipitating starvation includes many variables other than just decline of food availability. According to this view, famines are a result of entitlements,  the theory being proposed is called the "failure of exchange entitlements" or FEE.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} A person may own various commodities that can be exchanged in a market economy for the other commodities he or she needs. The exchange can happen via trading or production or through a combination of the two. These entitlements are called trade-based or production-based entitlements. Per this proposed view, famines are precipitated due to a breakdown in the ability of the person to exchange his entitlements.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}} An example of famines due to FEE is the inability of an agricultural laborer to exchange his primary entitlement, i.e., labor for rice when his employment became erratic or was completely eliminated.{{sfn|Chaudhari|1984|p=135}}

According to the Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), global [[climate change]] is additionally challenging the Earth's ability to produce food, potentially leading to famine.&lt;ref name="Psrccaf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and Famine|url=http://www.psr.org/resources/climate-change-and-famine.html|publisher=Physicians for Social Responsibility|accessdate=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements make a particular region more vulnerable to famine. These include poverty, [[population growth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14291581 |title='Top 10 culprits' for Horn of Africa hunger |publisher=BBC News |date=26 July 2011 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an inappropriate social infrastructure, a suppressive political regime, and a weak or under-prepared government.{{sfn|Ravallion|1996|p=1}}

According to a FEWSNET report, "Famines are not natural phenomena, they are catastrophic political failures."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oxfam.org/en/pressroom/reactions/fewsnet-report-260000-people-died-somalia-famine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate and population pressure===
[[File:Starved child.jpg|thumb|upright|A child suffering extreme starvation in [[India]], 1972]]
Many famines are caused by imbalance of food production compared to the large populations of countries whose [[Human overpopulation|population exceeds the regional carrying capacity]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Historically, famines have occurred from agricultural problems such as [[drought]], crop failure, or [[infectious disease|pestilence]]. Changing weather patterns, the ineffectiveness of medieval governments in dealing with crises, wars, and [[List of epidemics|epidemic diseases]] such as the [[Black Death]] helped to cause hundreds of famines in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]], including 95 in Britain and 75 in France.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3609390/Poor-studies-will-always-be-with-us.html "Poor studies will always be with us"], ''The Telegraph''&lt;/ref&gt; In France, the [[Hundred Years' War]], crop failures and epidemics reduced the population by two-thirds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3031536.html Don O'Reilly, "Hundred Years' War: Joan of Arc and the Siege of Orléans] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109043743/http://www.historynet.com/magazines/military_history/3031536.html |date=9 November 2006 }}", ''TheHistoryNet.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure of a harvest or change in conditions, such as [[drought]], can create a situation whereby large numbers of people continue to live where the [[carrying capacity]] of the land has temporarily dropped radically. Famine is often associated with [[subsistence]] agriculture. The total absence of agriculture in an economically strong area does not cause famine; [[Arizona]] and other wealthy regions import the vast majority of their food, since such regions produce sufficient economic goods for trade.

Famines have also been caused by volcanism. The 1815 eruption of the [[Mount Tambora]] volcano in Indonesia caused crop failures and famines worldwide and caused the worst famine of the 19th century. The current consensus of the scientific community is that the aerosols and dust released into the upper atmosphere causes cooler temperatures by preventing the sun's energy from reaching the ground. The same mechanism is theorized to be caused by very large meteorite impacts to the extent of causing mass extinctions.

===State-sponsored famines===
In certain cases, such as the [[Great Leap Forward]] in China (which produced the [[Great Chinese Famine|largest famine in absolute numbers]]), [[North Korean famine|North Korea in the mid-1990s]], or [[Zimbabwe]] in the early-2000s, famine can occur because of government policy.

[[File:GolodomorKharkiv.jpg|thumb|The government's [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|forced collectivization]] of agriculture was one of the main causes of the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]].]]
In 1932, under the rule of the USSR, [[Ukraine]] experienced one of its largest famines when between 2.4 and 7.5 million peasants died as a result of a state sponsored famine. It was termed the [[Holodomor]], suggesting that it was a deliberate campaign of repression designed to eliminate resistance to collectivization. Forced grain quotas imposed upon the rural peasants and a brutal reign of terror contributed to the widespread famine.

Barely enough grain was left for the peasants, and starvation occurred in many rural areas. Exportation of grain continued despite the famine and the government attempted to conceal it. While the famine is attributed to unintended consequences, it is believed that the government refused to acknowledge the problem, thereby further contributing to the deaths. In many instances, peasants were persecuted. Between 20 and 45 million people perished in this famine, making it one of the deadliest famines to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/maos-great-leap-forward-killed-45-million-in-four-years-2081630.html |title=Mao's Great Leap Forward 'killed 45 million in four years' |last=Akbar |first=Arifa |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |location=London |work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malawi ended its famine by subsidizing farmers despite the strictures imposed by the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref name=newyorktimes /&gt; During the 1973 [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia#Wollo famine|Wollo Famine]] in [[Ethiopia]], food was shipped out of Wollo to the capital city of [[Addis Ababa]], where it could command higher prices. In the late-1970s and early-1980s, residents of the [[dictatorship]]s of Ethiopia and [[Sudan]] suffered massive famines, but the [[democracy]] of [[Botswana]] avoided them, despite also suffering a severe drop in national food production. In [[Somalia]], famine occurred because of a [[failed state]].

According to Amartya Sen (1999)  “there has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracy”. Hasell and Roser have demonstrated that while there have been a few minor exceptions, famines rarely occur in democratic systems but are strongly correlated with [[Autocracy|autocratic]] and [[Colonialism|colonial]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ourworldindata.org/famines/|title=Famines|work=Our World in Data|access-date=2017-12-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famine prevention==
[[File:Famine in Algeria 1869.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|A starving child during the 1869 famine in [[Algeria]].]]
Relief technologies, including [[immunization]], improved [[public health]] infrastructure, general food rations and supplementary feeding for vulnerable children, has provided temporary mitigation to the mortality impact of famines, while leaving their economic consequences unchanged, and not solving the underlying issue of too large a regional population relative to food production capability. Humanitarian crises may also arise from [[genocide]] campaigns, [[civil war]]s, [[refugee]] flows and episodes of extreme violence and state collapse, creating famine conditions among the affected populations.

Despite repeated stated intentions by the world's leaders to end hunger and famine, famine remains a chronic threat in much of Africa, Eastern Europe, the Southeast, South Asia, and the Middle East. In July 2005, the [[Famine Early Warning Systems Network]] labelled [[Niger]] with emergency status, as well as [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[South Sudan]], [[Somalia]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. In January 2006, the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] warned that 11 million people in Somalia, [[Kenya]], [[Djibouti]] and Ethiopia were in danger of starvation due to the combination of severe drought and military conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2006/1000206/index.html|title=Millions of people are on the brink of starvation in the Horn of Africa|website=Fao.org|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the most serious humanitarian crisis in Africa was in [[Sudan]]'s region [[Darfur]].

[[Frances Moore Lappé]], later co-founder of the [[Institute for Food and Development Policy]] (Food First) argued in ''[[Diet for a Small Planet]]'' (1971) that [[vegetarian]] diets can provide food for larger populations, with the same resources, compared to omnivorous diets.

Noting that modern famines are sometimes aggravated by misguided economic policies, political design to impoverish or marginalize certain populations, or acts of war, political economists have investigated the political conditions under which famine is prevented. Economist [[Amartya Sen]]{{refn|Sen is known for his assertion that famines do not occur in democracies in much the same way that [[Adam Smith]] is associated with the "[[invisible hand]]" and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] with "[[creative destruction]]".{{sfn|Massing|2003|p=1}}|group=note}} states that the liberal institutions that exist in India, including competitive elections and a free press, have played a major role in preventing famine in that country since independence. [[Alex de Waal]] has developed this theory to focus on the "political contract" between rulers and people that ensures famine prevention, noting the rarity of such political contracts in Africa, and the danger that international relief agencies will undermine such contracts through removing the locus of accountability for famines from national governments.

[[File:Russia Famine Saratov 1921.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|A woman, a man and a child, all three dead from starvation. [[Russia]], 1921.]]
The demographic impacts of famine are sharp. Mortality is concentrated among children and the elderly. A consistent demographic fact is that in all recorded famines, male mortality exceeds female, even in those populations (such as northern India and Pakistan) where there is a male longevity advantage during normal times. Reasons for this may include greater female resilience under the pressure of malnutrition, and possibly female's naturally higher percentage of body fat. Famine is also accompanied by lower fertility. Famines therefore leave the reproductive core of a population—adult women—lesser affected compared to other population categories, and post-famine periods are often characterized a "rebound" with increased births.

Even though the theories of [[Thomas Malthus]] would predict that famines reduce the size of the population commensurate with available food resources, in fact even the most severe famines have rarely dented population growth for more than a few years. The mortality in China in 1958–61, Bengal in 1943, and Ethiopia in 1983–85 was all made up by a growing population over just a few years. Of greater long-term demographic impact is emigration: Ireland was chiefly depopulated after the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|1840s famines]] by waves of emigration.

===Food security===
{{Main|food security}}
Long term measures to improve food security, include investment in modern [[agriculture]] techniques, such as [[fertilizers]] and [[irrigation]],&lt;ref name=obama&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/09/world/europe/09food.html "Obama enlists major powers to aid poor farmers with $15 billion"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but can also include strategic national [[food storage]].

[[World Bank]] strictures restrict government subsidies for farmers, and increasing use of fertilizers is opposed by some environmental groups because of its unintended consequences: adverse effects on water supplies and habitat.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/02/world/africa/02malawi.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=1 "Ending Famine, Simply by Ignoring the Experts"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 2 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atlantic&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/issues/97jan/borlaug/borlaug.htm |title=Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity |publisher=The Atlantic |date=5 January 2016 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Norman Borlaug]], father of the [[Green Revolution]], is often credited with saving over a billion people worldwide from starvation.]]
The effort to bring modern agricultural techniques found in the [[Western world]], such as [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizers]] and [[pesticides]], to the [[Indian Sub-continent]], called the [[Green Revolution]], resulted in decreases in malnutrition similar to those seen earlier in Western nations. This was possible because of existing [[infrastructure]] and institutions that are in short supply in [[Africa]], such as a system of roads or public [[seed]] companies that made seeds available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/world/africa/10rice.html|title=In Africa, Prosperity From Seeds Falls Short|date=10 October 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting [[farmer]]s in areas of food insecurity, through such measures as free or subsidized [[fertilizer]]s and [[seed]]s, increases food harvest and reduces food prices.&lt;ref name=newyorktimes/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Christian Science Monitor  |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0618/p07s01-woaf.html |title=How a Kenyan village tripled its corn harvest |date=18 June 2008 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] and some rich nations press nations that depend on them for aid to cut back or eliminate subsidized agricultural inputs such as fertilizer, in the name of [[privatization]] even as the [[United States]] and [[Europe]] extensively subsidized their own farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4678592.stm|title=BBC NEWS&amp;nbsp;— Africa&amp;nbsp;— Zambia: Fertile but hungry|website=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relief===
{{Main|Famine relief}}
There is a growing realization among aid groups that giving cash or cash vouchers instead of food is a cheaper, faster, and more efficient way to deliver help to the hungry, particularly in areas where food is available but unaffordable.&lt;ref name=csmonitor&gt;{{cite web |author=The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0604/p01s02-woaf.html |title=UN aid debate: Give cash, not food? |date=4 June 2008 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations]]' [[World Food Program]] (WFP), the biggest non-governmental distributor of food, announced that it will begin distributing cash and vouchers instead of food in some areas, which Josette Sheeran, the WFP's executive director, described as a "revolution" in food aid.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;&lt;ref name=wfp&gt;http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212124012/http://www.wfp.org/english/?ModuleID=137&amp;Key=2899 |date=12 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aid agency [[Concern Worldwide]] is piloting a method through a [[mobile phone]] operator, Safaricom, which runs a money transfer program that allows cash to be sent from one part of the country to another.&lt;ref name=csmonitor/&gt;

[[Ethiopia]] has been pioneering a program that has now become part of the World Bank's prescribed recipe for coping with a food crisis and had been seen by aid organizations as a model of how to best help hungry nations. Through the country's main food assistance program, the Productive Safety Net Program, Ethiopia has been giving rural residents who are chronically short of food, a chance to work for food or cash. Foreign aid organizations like the World Food Program were then able to buy food locally from surplus areas to distribute in areas with a shortage of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author =The Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0506/p01s06-woaf.html?page=2 |title=Ethiopia: A model of African food aid is now in trouble |date=6 May 2008 |work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Revolution]] was widely viewed as an answer to famine in the 1970s and 1980s. Between 1950 and 1984, hybrid strains of high-yielding crops transformed agriculture around the globe and world grain production increased by 250%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/6496585.stm|title=Special Reports&amp;nbsp;– The limits of a Green Revolution?|work=BBC News|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some{{who|date=August 2013}} criticize the process, stating that these new high-yielding crops require more chemical [[fertilizer]]s and [[pesticide]]s, which can harm the environment.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Although these high-yielding crops make it technically possible to feed more people, there are indications that regional food production has peaked in many world sectors, due to certain strategies associated with intensive agriculture such as [[groundwater]] [[overdrafting]] and overuse of [[pesticide]]s and other agricultural chemicals.

===Levels of food insecurity===
{{Main|Famine scales}}
In modern times, local and political governments and [[non-governmental organization]]s that deliver famine relief have limited resources with which to address the multiple situations of food insecurity that are occurring simultaneously.  Various methods of categorizing the gradations of food security have thus been used in order to most efficiently allocate food relief.  One of the earliest were the [[Indian Famine Codes]] devised by the British in the 1880s. The Codes listed three stages of food insecurity: near-scarcity, scarcity and famine, and were highly influential in the creation of subsequent famine warning or measurement systems.  The early warning system developed to monitor the region inhabited by the [[Turkana people]] in northern [[Kenya]] also has three levels, but links each stage to a pre-planned response to mitigate the crisis and prevent its deterioration

The experiences of famine relief organizations throughout the world over the 1980s and 1990s resulted in at least two major developments: the "livelihoods approach" and the increased use of nutrition indicators to determine the severity of a crisis. Individuals and groups in food stressful situations will attempt to cope by rationing consumption, finding alternative means to supplement [[income]], etc., before taking desperate measures, such as selling off plots of [[agriculture|agricultural]] land. When all means of self-support are exhausted, the affected population begins to migrate in search of food or fall victim to outright mass [[starvation]]. Famine may thus be viewed partially as a social phenomenon, involving [[Market (economics)|market]]s, the price of food, and social support structures. A second lesson drawn was the increased use of rapid nutrition assessments, in particular of children, to give a quantitative measure of the famine's severity.

Since 2003, many of the most important organizations in famine relief, such as the [[World Food Programme]] and the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], have adopted a five-level scale measuring intensity and magnitude. The intensity scale uses both livelihoods' measures and measurements of mortality and child malnutrition to categorize a situation as food secure, food insecure, food crisis, famine, severe famine, and extreme famine. The number of deaths determines the magnitude designation, with under 1000 fatalities defining a "minor famine" and a "catastrophic famine" resulting in over 1,000,000 deaths.

==Society and culture==
Famine personified as an [[allegory]] is found in some cultures, e.g. one of the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] in Christian tradition,  the [[fear gorta]] of Irish folklore, or the [[Wendigo]] of [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tradition.

The '''Fraunhofer Society''' ({{lang-de|Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der angewandten Forschung e.{{nnbsp}}V.}},&lt;ref&gt;{{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|aʊ|n|ˌ|h|oʊ|f|ər}}; {{IPA-de|ˈfraʊnˌhoːfɐ|lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Fraunhofer Society for the Advancement of Applied Research") is a German research organization with 72{{nbsp}}institutes spread throughout [[Germany]], each focusing on different fields of applied science (as opposed to the [[Max Planck Society]], which works primarily on basic science). With over 25,000 employees, mainly [[scientist]]s and [[engineer]]s and with an annual research budget of about €2.3{{nbsp}}billion&lt;ref name = Facts&gt;[http://www.fraunhofer.de/en/about-fraunhofer/profile-structure/facts-and-figures.html Facts and Figures]&lt;/ref&gt; it is the biggest organisation for applied research and development services in Europe. 

Some basic funding for the Fraunhofer Society is provided by the state (the German public, through the federal government together with the states or ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'', "owns" the Fraunhofer Society), but more than 70% of the funding is earned through contract work, either for government-sponsored projects or from industry.&lt;ref name = Facts/&gt;

It is named after [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] who, as a scientist, an engineer, and an entrepreneur, is said to have superbly exemplified the goals of the society.

The organization has seven centers in the United States, under the name "Fraunhofer USA", and three in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== The Fraunhofer model ==
The so-called "Fraunhofer model" has been in existence since 1973 and has led to the society's continuing growth. Under the model, the Fraunhofer Society earns about 70% of its income through contracts with industry or specific government projects. The other 30% of the budget is sourced in the proportion 9:1 from federal and state (Land) government grants and is used to support preparatory research.

Thus the size of the society's budget depends largely on its success in maximizing revenue from commissions. This funding model applies not just to the central society itself but also to the individual institutes. This serves both to drive the realisation of the Fraunhofer Society's strategic direction of becoming a leader in applied research as well as encouraging a flexible, autonomous and entrepreneurial approach to the society's research priorities.

==Institutes==
The Fraunhofer Society currently operates 72 institutes and research units. These are '''Fraunhofer Institute'''s for:

==History==
[[Image:Stamp Germany 1999 MiNr2038 Fraunhofer Gesellschaft.jpg|thumb|right|A German stamp: 50 years of the Fraunhofer Society]]
The Fraunhofer Society was founded in [[Munich]] on March 26, 1949, by representatives of industry and academia, the government of [[Bavaria]], and the nascent [[Federal Republic of Germany|Federal Republic]].

In 1952, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs declared the Fraunhofer Society to be the third part of the non-university German research landscape (alongside the [[German Research Foundation]] (DFG) and the [[Max Planck Institute]]s). Whether the Fraunhofer Society should support applied research through its own facilities was, however, the subject of a long-running dispute.

From 1954, the Society's first institutes developed. By 1956, it was developing research facilities in cooperation with the Ministry of Defense. In 1959, the Fraunhofer Society comprised nine institutes with 135 coworkers and a budget of 3.6&amp;nbsp;million [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]].

In 1965, the Fraunhofer Society was identified as a sponsor organization for applied research.

In 1968, the Fraunhofer Society became the target of public criticism for its role in military research.

By 1969, Fraunhofer had more than 1,200 employees in 19 institutes. The budget stood at 33 million [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]]. At this time, a "commission for the promotion of the development of the Fraunhofer Society" planned the further development of the Fraunhofer Society (FhG). The commission developed a financing model that would make the Society dependent on its commercial success. This would later come to be known as the "Fraunhofer Model".

The Model was agreed to by the Federal Cabinet and the Bund-Länder-Kommission in 1973. In the same year, the executive committee and central administration moved into joint accommodation at Leonrodstraße 54 in [[Munich]].

The Fraunhofer program for the promotion of the consulting research for [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]] was established, and has gained ever more significance in subsequent years.

In 1977, the political ownership of the society was shared by the Ministries of Defense and Research.

By 1984, the Fraunhofer Society had 3,500 employees in 33 institutes and a research budget of 360 million [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]].

By 1988, defense research represented only about 10% of the entire expenditure of the Fraunhofer Society.

By 1989, the Fraunhofer Society had nearly 6,400 employees in 37 institutes, with a total budget of 700 million [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]].

In 1991, the Fraunhofer Society faced the challenge of integrating numerous research establishments in former East Germany as branch offices of already-existing institutes in the Fraunhofer Society.

In 1993, the Fraunhofer Society's total budget exceeded 1&amp;nbsp;billion [[German mark|Deutsche Mark]].

In 1994, the Society founded a US-based subsidiary, Fraunhofer USA, Inc., to extend the outreach of Fraunhofer's R&amp;D network to American clients.

Its mission statement of 2000 committed the Fraunhofer Society to being a market and customer-oriented, nationally and internationally active sponsor organization for institutes of the applied research.

In 1999, Fraunhofer initiated Fraunhofer Venture, a [[University_technology_transfer_offices|technology transfer office]], to advance the transfer of its scientific research findings and meet the growing entrepreneurial spirit in the Fraunhofer institutes.

Between 2000 and 2001, the institutes and IT research centers of the GMD (Gesellschaft für Mathematik und Datenverarbeitung – Society for Mathematics and Information technology) were integrated into the Fraunhofer Society at the initiative of the Federal Ministry for Education and Research.

The year 2000 marked a noteworthy success at Fraunhofer-Institut for Integrated Circuits (IIS): [[MP3]], a [[Lossy compression|lossy]] audio format which they developed, is the most widely adopted method for compressing and decompressing digital audio.

In 2002, ownership of the Heinrich-Hertz-Institut for Communications Technology Berlin GmbH (HHI), which belonged to the Gottfried William Leibniz Society e. V. (GWL), was transferred to the Fraunhofer Society. With this integration the Fraunhofer Society budget exceeded €1&amp;nbsp;billion for the first time.

In 2003, the Fraunhofer Society headquarters moved to its own building in [[Munich]].

The Fraunhofer Society developed and formulated a firm specific mission statement summarizing fundamental targets and codifying the desired "values and guidelines" of the society's "culture". Amongst these, the society committed itself to improving the opportunities for female employees and coworkers to identify themselves with the enterprise and to develop their own creative potential.

In 2004, the former "Fraunhofer Working Group for Electronic Media Technology" at the Fraunhofer-Institut for Integrated Circuits (IIS) gained the status of an independent institute. It becomes Fraunhofer-Institut for Digital Media Technology IDMT.

New alliances and topic groups helped to strengthen the market operational readiness level of the institutes for Fraunhofer in certain jurisdictions.

In 2005, two new institutes, the Leipzig Fraunhofer-Institut for Cell Therapy and Immunology (IZI), and the Fraunhofer Center for Nano-electronic technologies CNT in [[Dresden]], were founded.

In 2006, the Fraunhofer Institute for Intelligent Analysis and Information Systems (IAIS) was founded as a merger between the Institute for Autonomous Intelligent Systems (AIS), and the Institute for Media Communication (IMK).

In 2009, the former FGAN Institutes were converted into a Fraunhofer Institutes, amongst them the Fraunhofer Institute for Communication, Information Processing and Ergonomics FKIE and the Fraunhofer Institute for Radar and High Frequency Technology FHR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fkie.fraunhofer.de/de/Pressemeldungen/FKIE_staerkt_Bonn_als_nationales_Zentrum_fuer_Cybersicherheit.html |title=Fraunhofer-FKIE stärkt Bonn als nationales Zentrum für Cybersicherheit | access-date=2017-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6827">[[File:Bloomsbury Square1.jpg|thumb|[[Bloomsbury Square]], a garden square in central London, England.]]

A '''garden square''' is a type of [[communal garden]] in an urban area wholly or substantially surrounded by buildings and, commonly, continues to be applied to public and private parks formed after such a garden becomes accessible to the public at large. The archetypal garden square is surrounded by tall [[terraced houses]] and other types of [[townhouse]]. It is subtly distinguished from a public-access version throughout the existence of the square &amp;ndash; the [[town square]].  Due to its inherent private history it may have a pattern of dedicated [[footpath]]s and tends to have considerably more plants than hard surfaces and/or large monuments. 

==Propagation==
{{see also|Town square}}
At their conception in the early 17th century each such garden was a private [[commons|communal amenity]] for the residents of the overlooking houses akin to a garden [[courtyard]] within a palace or community. Such community courtyards date back to at least [[Ur]] in 2000 BC where two-storey houses were built of fired brick around an open square. [[Kitchen]], working, and public spaces were located on the ground floor, with private rooms located upstairs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YvpfndOKwGgC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=false#v=onepage&amp;q=false&amp;f=false Tim McNeese (1999), ''History of Civilization - The Ancient World'', Lorenz Educational Press, p. 10] {{ISBN|9780787703875}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The conversion of many during the 20th century into public parks renders those garden squares a subset of town squares, that is those with a garden square heritage. Some remain private &amp;mdash; they may open intermittently or regularly &amp;mdash; but many today are open to the public at least during part of every day, serving as small parks.

==Occurrence==
===Europe===
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
====United Kingdom====
London is famous for them; they are described as one of the glories of the capital.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/7881665/Court-denies-couple-use-of-garden-square.html "Court denies couple use of garden square"], Martin Evans, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 10 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Many were built or rebuilt during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, at the height of [[Georgian architecture]], and are surrounded by [[Townhouse (Great Britain)|elegant townhouses]]. Large projects, such as the [[Bedford Estate]], included garden squares in their development. The [[Notting Hill]] and [[Bloomsbury]] neighbourhoods both have many garden squares, with the former mostly still restricted to residents, and the latter open to all.  Other UK cities prominent in the Georgian era such as [[Edinburgh]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], [[Bristol]] and [[Leeds]] have several garden squares.

Householders with access to a private garden square are commonly required to pay a maintenance levy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/councilanddemocracy/counciltax/gardensquarelevies.aspx Council tax and garden square levies], [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Normally the charge is set annually by a garden committee. 

Sometimes private garden squares are opened to the public, such as during Open Garden Squares Weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensquares.org/ Open Garden Squares Weekend], London, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
=====In Paris=====
Privately owned squares which survived the decades after the [[French Revolution]] and 19th century [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris]] include the [[Place des Vosges]] and [[Square des Épinettes]] in Paris. It was a fashionable and expensive square to live in during the 17th and 18th centuries, and one of the central reasons that [[Le Marais]] district became so fashionable for French nobility.  It was inaugurated in 1612 with a grand ''[[carrousel]]'' to celebrate the engagement of [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] to [[Anne of Austria]] and is a prototype of the residential squares of European cities that were to come. What was new about the ''Place Royale'' as it was known in 1612 was that the house fronts were all built to the same design, probably by [[Baptiste du Cerceau]].

In town squares, similarly green but publicly accessible from the outset, is the [[Square René Viviani]]. Gardens substantially cover a few of the famous ''Places'' in the capital; instead the majority are paved and replete with profoundly hard materials such as [[Place de la Concorde]].  Inspired by ecological interests and a 21st century focus on pollution mitigation, an increasing number of the Places in Paris today many have a focal tree, or surrounding raised flower beds/and or rows of trees such as the [[Place de la République]].  

The enclosed garden terraces (''French: jardins en terrain'') and courtyards (''French: cours'') of some [[List_of_palaces#France|French former palaces]] have resulted in redevelopments into spaces equivalent to garden squares.  The same former single-owner scenario applies to at least one garden square in London ([[Squares_in_London#West_and_southwest|Coleridge Square]]).

=====Outside of Paris=====
Grandiose instances of garden-use town squares are a part of many French cities, others opt for solid material town squares.  

===Belgium===
The Square de Meeûs and Square Orban are notable examples in Brussels. 

===Ireland===
Dublin has several Georgian examples, including [[Merrion Square]].

===The Americas===
{{expand section|date=March 2018}}
====United States====
[[Rittenhouse Square]] in the [[Center City, Philadelphia]] encases a public garden, one of the five original open-space parks planned by William Penn and his surveyor Thomas Holme during the late 17th century. It was first named Southwest Square.

Nearby [[Fitler Square]] is a similar garden square named for late 19th century Philadelphia mayor Edwin Henry Fitler shortly after his death in 1896. The Square, cared for through a public private partnership between the Department of Parks and Recreation and the Fitler Square Improvement Association.

In [[Boston]] tens of squares exist, some having a mainly residential use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3489">'''Helmut Winschermann''' (born 22 March 1920) is a German classical oboist, conductor and teacher.  He founded the [[Deutsche Bachsolisten]] (German Bach Soloists) and has been their conductor since 1960.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Deutsche Bachsolisten 1973 on tour of Southern Africa.jpeg|thumb|right|Photo 1973, Bachsolisten orchestra tour Southern Adrica.Dedicated to tour organiser Hans Adler.[http://classicalmusicianstoza.blogspot.ca/2014/06/deutche-bachsolisten-under-helmut.html] ≈]] --&gt;

==Career==
Helmut Winschermann was born in [[Mülheim|Mülheim an der Ruhr]] in 1920.  He became an orchestral oboist with the Municipal Orchestra of [[Oberhausen]] after studying in Essen and Paris.  From 1945 he was principal oboe with the [[hr-Sinfonieorchester|Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra]] including in its period known as the Hessen Radio Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name=all&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/helmut-winschermann-mn0000574882/biography AllMusic]; Retrieved 27 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

With the flautist [[Kurt Redel]] and harpsichordist Irmgard Winschermann Lechner, he was a co-founder of the chamber music ensemble Collegium Pro Arte, later called the Collegium Instrumentale Detmold.

In 1956 he was appointed principal chair of the oboe department at the [[Hochschule für Musik Detmold]], having taught there since 1948.&lt;ref name=all/&gt;  His students include [[Hansjörg Schellenberger]], [[Fumiaki Miyamoto]], [[Ingo Goritzki]], Günther Passin and Gernot Schmalfuß.

He recorded the [[Oboe Quartet (Mozart)| Mozart Oboe Quartet in F Major (K.370)]] with the [[Günter Kehr|Kehr]] Trio issued in 1957 on [[Teldec|Telefunken]] LGX 66065 in the UK.

He maintained a touring schedule as a soloist, and frequently collaborated with the [[Cappella Coloniensis]], the Chamber Orchestra of the Saar under [[Karl Ristenpart]], and the [[Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra]] under [[Karl Münchinger]].

Winschermann founded the instrumental ensemble [[Deutsche Bachsolisten]] in 1960, in order to provide [[historically informed performance]]s of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and his baroque contemporaries.  He initially divided his time between playing the oboe and conducting the group, but later focussed on conducting solely.&lt;ref name=all/&gt;  Under his direction they have made a multitude of recordings and toured widely internationally.  They are particularly popular in Japan, having visited there at least 14 times.&lt;ref name=all/&gt; 

In 2010 the group celebrated its 50th anniversary in a concert at the [[Beethovenhalle]] in [[Bonn]], with the 90-year-old Winschermann conducting his own orchestration of Bach's ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''.

==Honours==
In 1992 Helmut Winschermann was made an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.&lt;ref name=all/&gt;

In 2013 he won the [[Georg Philipp Telemann Prize]] of [[Magdeburg]].

He has twice been awarded the [[Edison Prize]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2043">'''Imprelis''' is a selective herbicide created by [[DuPont]].  The active ingredient is [[aminocyclopyrachlor]], a synthetic [[auxin]].&lt;ref&gt;Product label: http://www2.dupont.com/Professional_Products/en_US/assets/downloads/pdfs/H65717.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MSDS: http://msds.dupont.com/msds/pdfs/EN/PEN_09004a358053f153.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Imprelis was registered with the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;EPA site http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/chemical/pesticide-registrations/aminocyclopyrachlor.html&lt;/ref&gt; for sale in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ksl.com/?nid=153&amp;sid=16681845&lt;/ref&gt;  Sale of Imprelis was voluntarily suspended&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imprelis-facts.com/&lt;/ref&gt; a week before the EPA required sales stopped.&lt;ref&gt;EPA site http://www.epa.gov/compliance/resources/cases/civil/fifra/dupontimprelis.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ksl.com/?nid=153&amp;sid=16681845&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont acknowledged it was killing or damaging evergreen trees, including [[white pine]] and [[Norway spruce]].&lt;ref name="DFP"&gt;Detroit Free Press, May 21, 2012, page A1&lt;/ref&gt; DuPont allegedly knew Imprelis would damage evergreens before seeking EPA approval.&lt;ref&gt;Detroit Free Press, Aug 12, 2011, page A1&lt;/ref&gt;

DuPont offered to compensate customers whose trees were affected. They asked that a claim be submitted, and said that they would send a claim resolution agreement, which would specify the amount DuPont would pay to settle the claim. By late May 2012, the end of the planting season, many tree owners had not heard from DuPont. Other tree owners who accepted payment agreements with DuPont had not been paid.&lt;ref name="DFP"/&gt;

Several hundred tree owners have filed lawsuits with DuPont. They are seeking [[class action]] status.&lt;ref name="DFP"/&gt;

'''Infant crying''' is the crying of infants as a response to an internal or external [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]]. Infants cry as a form of basic instinctive [[communication]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eEsyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT35&amp;dq=Infants+cry+as+a+form+of+basic+instinctive+communication#v=onepage&amp;q=Infants%20cry%20as%20a%20form%20of%20basic%20instinctive%20communication&amp;f=false|title=The Calm and Happy Toddler: Gentle Solutions to Tantrums, Night Waking, Potty Training and More|last=Chicot|first=Dr Rebecca|date=2015-12-03|publisher=Random House|isbn=9781473527591|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, [[newborn]]s are transitioning from life in the [[womb]] to the external environment.{{sfn | Walker| page = 210}} Up to 27% of parents describe problems with infant crying in the first four months.

==Physiology==
Crying may elicit the [[Valsalva maneuver|Valsalva reflex]]. This reflex negatively impacts [[breastfeeding|sucking]] [[Suction|pressure]]s and results in poor feeding. The [[cortisol]] levels will rise along with [[blood pressure]]. Increased blood pressure will have an effect on [[cerebral blood flow]], [[cerebral blood flow velocity]] and [[intracranial pressure]]. Increased pressures and velocity can lead to [[intracranial hemmorrhage]]. Prolonged exhalation may also cause some [[adverse effect]]s. Obstructed [[venous return]] and quick inspiratory gasp can occur. [[Foramen ovale (heart)|Foramen ovale]] shunting can occur.{{sfn | Walker | page = 210}} Adults can often determine whether an infant's cries signify [[anger]] or [[pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zeskind|first=P.

==Misconceptions==
Misconceptions regarding the purpose of crying in the infant are common among caregivers and medical personnel. These are usually determined by cultural mores and not by [[evidence-based medicine|evidence-based]] explanations. The crying of an infant is regarded by some to be normal and good.&lt;ref name = roberts&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2004/0815/p735.html|title=Infantile Colic|first1=Donna M.|last1=Roberts|first2=Michael|last2=Ostapchuk|first3=Jmes G.|last3=O'Brien|date=15 August 2004|journal=American Family Physician|volume=70|issue=4|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It's OK to be a cry baby at bedtime, study says."

===Colic===
{{Main|Colic}}
The term 'colic' was defined in 1954 as: " crying for more than three hours per day, for more than three days per week, and for more than three weeks in an infant that is well-fed and otherwise healthy."&lt;ref name = roberts/&gt; Colic and excessive crying by infants is synonymous to some clinicians.&lt;ref name=Gri2014&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grimes|first1=edited by Frank Domino, Robert A.

==Maternal responses==
Crying in infants is associated with high stress levels and depression in mothers.&lt;ref name=AFP2015&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.aafp.org/afp/2015/1001/p577.html|last1=Johnson|first1=JD|last2=Cocker|first2=K|last3=Chang|first3=E|title=Infantile Colic: Recognition and Treatment|journal=American Family Physician|date=1 October 2015 |accessdate = 22 July 2017| volume=92|issue=7|pages=577–82|pmid=26447441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = hu&gt;{{cite journal|title=Maternal anxiety versus depressive disorders: specific relations to infants' crying, feeding and sleeping problems|first1=J.|last1=Petzoldt|first2=H.-U.|last2=Wittchen|first3=F.|last3=Einsle|first4=J.|last4=Martini|date=1 March 2016|journal=Child: Care, Health and Development|volume=42|issue=2|pages=231–245|doi=10.1111/cch.12292|pmid=26490836}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Fallon|last2=Seymour|first2=Monique|last3=Giallo|first3=Rebecca|last4=Cann|first4=Warren|last5=Nicholson|first5=Jan M.|last6=Green|first6=Julie|last7=Hiscock|first7=Harriet|title=Comparison of methods for recruiting and engaging parents in online interventions: study protocol for the Cry Baby infant sleep and settling program|journal=BMC Pediatrics|volume=15|issue=1|pages=174|year=2015|doi=10.1186/s12887-015-0502-9|pmid=26556032|pmc=4640160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excessive crying has also been linked to maternal "physical aggression" and "angry speaking". The burden of care of the mother, that is, mothers without assistance in caring for the infant, are more prone to physical aggression and angry speaking.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt; During evaluations of maternal depression responses to infant crying, sleeping problems are closely associated with excessive crying and may confound the conclusions of such research. Also, it is not always clear that when sleeping problems are associated with infant crying, whether the sleeping problems are descriptive of the mother or the infant or both.&lt;ref name = hu/&gt; Maternal stress is associated with excessive crying.&lt;ref name=Ia2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Iacovou|first=M|author2=Ralston, RA |author3=Muir, J |author4=Walker, KZ |author5= Truby, H |title=Dietary management of infantile colic: a systematic review.|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|date=August 2012|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1319–31|pmid=21710185|doi=10.1007/s10995-011-0842-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effects on young children==
One definition used to study excessive crying in infants is crying for three or more hours per 24 hours. Excessive infant crying has been associated with a twofold increased risk of the overall problem behavior, conduct problems, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6. Excessive infant crying doubles the risk of behavioral, hyperactivity, and mood problems at the age of 5–6, as reported by their mother. Excessive crying is not the only factor in later childhood difficulties. Behavioral problems in childhood include the so-called regulatory problems, such as excessive crying, sleeping, and feeding problems, which occur in 20% of infants in multiproblem families. Excessive crying, whining and sleeping problems at 4–6 months are associated with decreased social development at 12 months.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Several factors may contribute to, and partly explain, an association between excessive infant crying and later behavioral and emotional problems. During early infancy, the quality of the mother–child dyad can be considered to be a crucial vehicle for child’s healthy mental development. Both early maternal and early paternal reciprocity in infancy are predictive of social competence and lower aggression in preschoolers.&lt;ref name=clara/&gt;

Compared to other infants, excessive crying infants had a slightly lower birth weight and a slightly younger gestational age. Excessive crying infants more often had a single, lower educated mother, originating from a non-industrialized country, who reported more depression, a higher burden of infant care, and more aggressive behavior and had an authoritarian parenting style. Excessive crying was associated with a higher risk for hyperactivity/inattention problems, emotional symptoms, conduct problems, peer relationship problems, and overall problem behavior at the age of 5–6, as well as a higher risk for decreased pro-social behavior as reported by the mother. Excessive crying was also associated with mood problems as well as generalized anxiety problems at the age of 5–6.&lt;ref name = clara/&gt;

==Abuse==
{{Main|Abusive head trauma}}

===Normal crying===
The physical abuse of infants is related to crying.&lt;ref name = reij&gt;{{cite journal|title=Infant crying and abuse|first1=Sijmen A.|last1=Reijneveld|first2=Marcel F.|last2=van der Wal|first3=Emily|last3=Brugman|first4=Remy A. Hira|last4=Sing|first5=S.

This is the most common cause of child abuse death. Fathers are often the ones who shake the infant. Shaking may occur many times. This shaking can cause serious injuries in almost 50% of the time. Some caregivers are unaware that shaking the baby can seriously harm or kill the infant. This type of abuse is being addressed by efforts to educate parents and caregivers with educational flyers and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Parents' behavior in response to infant crying: Abusive head trauma education|first1=Hina|last1=Simonnet|first2=Anne|last2=Laurent-Vannier|first3=Wenlun|last3=Yuan|first4=Marie|last4=Hully|first5=Sakil|last5=Valimahomed|first6=Malek|last6=Bourennane|first7=Mathilde|last7=Chevignard|date=1 December 2014|journal=Child Abuse &amp; Neglect|volume=38|issue=12|pages=1914–1922|doi=10.1016/j.chiabu.2014.06.002|pmid=25043922}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention and treatment==
Infant crying is worse in the first few months of life, but improves as the child grows. A baby can sometimes be calmed by rocking gently, offering a pacifier, singing or talking softly, taking a walk with a stroller, or going for a drive in the car. If a baby won’t stop crying, it can be sick and seen by a doctor. Frustration and stress can be overwhelming for those with a crying infant. If caregivers feel as if they may lose control there are preventative measures that can be taken. The caregiver may benefit by calling a friend, relative, neighbor, or parent helpline for support. Another suggestion is to  put the baby in a safe place and walk away. The baby can be checked  every 5 to 10 minutes. 
Babies may be in danger if a person who is easily irritated or has a temper or history of violence cares for or watches the baby.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childmaltreatment/abusive-head-trauma.html {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When "normal" causes of excessive crying are ruled out, some caregivers adopt alternative and complementary treatments for excessive crying. Those practices include: 
* Eliminating milk products, eggs, wheat, and nuts from the diet of breastfeeding mothers
* Feeding infants fiber-enriched formula; not proven to be of benefit for most infants
* Counseling parents about specific colic-management techniques; not proven to be effective for most infants
* Infant massage; not proven to be effective or recommended&lt;ref name = roberts/&gt;

Those who realize that an infant can be in a situation where abuse is a possibility, support can be offered to give a parent or caregiver a break when needed. Education and understanding can let the parent know that dealing with a crying baby can be very frustrating—especially when they are tired or stressed, but infant crying is normal and it will pass. Parents can be encouraged to take a calming break if needed while the baby is safe in the crib. Others can be sensitive and supportive in situations when parents are trying to calm a crying baby.

'''Informal learning''' is any learning that is not [[formal learning]] or [[non-formal learning]], such as self-directed learning or learning from experience. Informal learning is organized differently than formal and non-formal learning because it has no set objective in terms of learning outcomes and is never intentional from the learner’s standpoint. For all learners this includes heuristic language building, socialization, enculturation, and play. Informal learning is a pervasive ongoing phenomenon of learning via participation or learning via knowledge creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning via knowledge acquisition.

The term is often conflated, however, with non-formal learning, and self-directed learning. It is widely used in the context of corporate training and education in relation to return on investment (ROI), or return on learning (ROL). It is also widely used when referring to science education, in relation to citizen science, or informal science education.  The conflated meaning of informal and non-formal learning explicates mechanisms of learning that organically occur outside the realm of traditional instructor-led programs, e.g., reading self-selected books, participating in self-study programs, navigating performance support materials and systems, incidental skills practice, receptivity of coaching or mentoring, seeking advice from peers, or participation in [[communities of practice]], to name a few. Informal learning is common in communities where individuals have opportunities to [[observational learning|observe]] and participate in social activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=Ruth|author2=Barbara Rogoff|title=Side by side: Learning by observing and pitching in|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychological Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterizations==
[[File:Open House Day 2015 Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters.jpg|thumb|Open House Day at [[ESO]]’s Headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open House Day 2015 – Long Night of Science at ESO’s Headquarters|url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1526a/|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Informal learning can be characterized as the following:
* It usually takes place outside [[education]]al [[school|establishments]];
* It does not follow a specified [[curriculum]] and is not often professionally organized but rather originates accidentally, sporadically, in association with certain occasions, from changing [[practical]] requirements;
* It is not necessarily planned [[pedagogically]], systematically according to fixed [[course (education)|subject]]s, [[test (student assessment)|test]] and [[wikt:qualification|qualification]]-oriented, but rather, either unconsciously incidental or consciously intended intuition, [[holistic]]ally [[problem]]-related, and related to actual situations and fitness for [[life]];
* It is experienced directly in its "[[Nature (philosophy)|natural]]" function of everyday life.
* It is often spontaneous and creative.
* It is a key component to an alternative learning system coined, [[Learning by Observing and Pitching In]] (LOPI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogoff|first=Barbara|title=Learning by Observing and Pitching-In Overview|url=http://www.learningbyobservingandpitchingin.com/icp-overview-english|accessdate=May 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the learning methods observed to be common in many Indigenous American communities.

==History==
In international discussions, the concept of informal learning, already used by [[John Dewey]] at an early stage and later on by [[Malcolm Knowles]], experienced a renaissance, especially in the context of development policy. At first, informal learning was only delimited from formal school learning and [[nonformal learning]] in courses ([[P. H. Coombs|Coombs]]/Achmed 1974). Marsick and Watkins take up this approach and go one step further in their definition. They, too, begin with the organizational form of learning and call those learning processes informal which are non-formal or not formally organized and are not financed by institutions ([[K. Watkins|Watkins]]/Marsick, p.&amp;nbsp;12 et sec.). An example for a wider approach is Livingstone's definition which is oriented towards [[autodidactic]] and self-directed learning and places special emphasis on the self-definition of the learning process by the learner ([[D. W. Livingstone|Livingstone]] 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;68 et seq.).

==Differences between informal and non-formal learning==
{{main|Non-formal learning}}
As noted above, informal learning is often confused with non-formal learning. Non-formal learning has been used to often describe organized learning outside of the formal education system, either being short-term, voluntary, and having, few if any, prerequisites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However they typically have a curriculum and often a facilitator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; As stated on the non-formal learning page, non-formal learning can be seen in various structured learning situations, such as swimming lessons, community-based sports programs and conference style seminars.

==Other perspective==
Merriam et al. (2007) state: "Informal learning, Schugurensky (2000) suggests, has its own internal forms that are important to distinguish in studying the phenomenon. He proposes three forms: self-directed learning, incidental learning, and socialization, or tacit learning. These differ among themselves in terms of intentionality and awareness at the time of the learning experience. Self-directed learning, for example, is intentional and conscious; incidental learning, which Marsick and Watkins (1990) describe as an accidental by-product of doing something else, is unintentional but after the experience she or he becomes aware that some learning has taken place; and finally, socialization or tacit learning is neither intentional nor conscious (although we can become aware of this learning later through 'retrospective recognition') (Marsick &amp; Watkins, 1990, p. 6)" (p.&amp;nbsp;36). More recently, Bennett (2012) extended Schugurenksky's (2000) conceptualization of informal by recommending four modes of informal learning: a) self-directed, which is conscious and intentional, b) incidental, which is conscious and unintentional, c) tacit, which replaces socialization and is both nonconscious and unintentional, and d) integrative, which is nonconscious and intentional. Drawing upon implicit processing literature, she further defined integrative learning as "a learning process that combines intentional nonconscious processing of tacit knowledge with conscious access to learning products and mental images" (Bennett, 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;4) and she theorized two possible sub-processes: knowledge shifting and knowledge sublimation, which describe limited access learners have to tacit knowledge.

==In American Indigenous communities==
People in many Indigenous communities of the Americas often learn through observation and participation in everyday life of their respective communities and families. Barbara Rogoff, a professor of psychology, and her colleagues describe the ways in which children in Indigenous communities can learn by observing and participating in community endeavors, having an eagerness to contribute, fulfilling valuable roles, and finding a sense of belonging in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rogoff|first=B|author2=L. Alcala |author3=A. Coppens |author4=A. Lopez |author5=O. Ruvalcaba |author6=K. Silva |title=Pitching in and catching on: Learning through intent community participation|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These learning experiences rely on children’s incorporation in the community and the child’s attentiveness. This form of informal learning allows the children to collaborate in social endeavors, which grants the child the opportunity to learn by pitching in.

Learning occurs through socialization processes in one's culture and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pewewardy|first1=Cornel|title=Learning styles of American Indian/Alaska native students: A review of the literature and implications for practice|journal=Journal of American Indian Education|date=2002|volume=41|issue=3|pages=22–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning by observing and pitching in (LOPI) is an Informal learning model often seen in many Indigenous communities of the Americas.

An example is the process where children learn slash-and-burn agriculture by being present in the situation and contributing when possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskins|first=S|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Noteworthy is children's own initiative and assumption of responsibility to perform tasks for the households' benefit. Many Indigenous communities provide self-paced opportunities to kids, and allow exploration and education without parental coercion. Collaborative input is highly encouraged and valued.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Children's Initiative in Contributions to Family Work in Indigenous-Heritage and Cosmopolitan Communities in Mexico|last = Alcala|first = et. al.|date = 2014|journal = Human Development |doi = 10.1159/000356763|pmid = |access-date =|volume=57|issue = 2–3|pages=96–115|bibcode = 2001HuDev..44..103S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both children and adults are actively involved in shared endeavors. Their roles as learner and expert are flexible, while the observer participates with active concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paradise|first=R|author2=B. Rogoff2|title=Side-by Side: Learning by Observing and Pitching In|journal=Journal of the Society for Psychology and Anthropology|year=2009|pages=102–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indigenous ways of learning include practices such as [[Observational learning#Indigenous communities of the Americas|observation]], experiential learning, and apprenticeship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hart|first=M|title=Indigenous Knowledge and Research: The Míkiwáhp as a Symbol for Reclaiming Our Knowledge and Ways of Knowing|url=http://journals.sfu.ca/fpcfr/index.php/FPCFR/article/view/26/64|journal=The First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review|year=2007|volume=3|issue=1|pages=83–90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Child work in indigenous American cultures|Child work]], alongside and combined with play, occupies an important place in American Indigenous children’s time and development. The interaction of a Navajo girl assisting her mother weaving and who eventually becomes a master weaver herself illustrates how the child's presence and the availability of these activities allow the child to learn through observation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Göncü|first=A.|title=Children’s and researchers’ engagement in the world|journal=Library of Congress Catalog|year=1999|pages=3–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Children start at the periphery, observing and imitating those around them, before moving into the center of activities under supervision and guidance. An example of 2-year-old Indigenous Mexican girl participating in digging-the-holes project with her mother highlights children's own initiation to help, after watching, and enthusiasm to share the task with family and community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Schooling and traditional collaborative social organization of problem solving by Mayan mothers and children |journal = Developmental Psychology|pages = 55–66|volume = 38|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/0012-1649.38.1.55|first = Pablo|last = Chavajay|first2 = Barbara|last2 = Rogoff|pmid=11806702|date=Jan 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work is part of a child’s development from an early age, starting with simple tasks that merge with play and develop to various kinds of useful work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bourdillon|first=M.|author2=D.

Children in Nicaragua will often learn to work the land or learn to become street vendors by watching other individuals in their community perform it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liebel|first=M.|title=The dignity of the working child: What children in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala think about their work|journal=Working Children's Protagonism: Social Movements and Empowerment in Latin America, Africa and India|year=2001|pages=53–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These activities provide opportunities for children to learn and develop through forms of social learning which are made up of everyday experiences rather than a deliberate curriculum, and contain ordinary setting in which children’s social interaction and behavior occur.  Informal learning for children in American Indigenous communities can take place at work where children are expected to contribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gaskin|first=S.|title=Children's Daily Activities in a Mayan Village: A Culturally Grounded Description|journal=Cross-Cultural Research|year=2000|volume=34|issue=4|pages=375–389|doi=10.1177/106939710003400405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nonverbal communication as a learning tool===

In terms of the cultural variation between traditional Indigenous American and European-American middle class, the prevalence of nonverbal communication can be viewed as being dependent on each culture’s definition of achievement. Often in mainstream middle-class culture, success in school and work settings is gained through practicing competitiveness and working for personal gain.&lt;ref&gt;Wynia, E. A. (2000). Teach the way the student learns: Culturally relevant teaching strategies appropriate to the native american student in the speech communication classroom. North Dakota Journal of Speech and Theatre, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The learning and teaching practices of traditional Indigenous Americans generally prioritize harmony and cooperation over personal gain.In order to achieve mutual respect in teachings, what is often relied on in Indigenous American culture is nonverbal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Hwang, C. Philip, Michael E. Lamb, and Irving E. Siegel. "Learning Respect for Everything: Navajo Images of Development." Images of Childhood. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1996. 167-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonverbal communication in Indigenous communities creates pathways of knowledge by watching and then doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 3195944|title = Interactional Style and Nonverbal Meaning: Mazahua Children Learning How to be Separate-but-Together|journal = Anthropology &amp; Education Quarterly|volume = 25|issue = 2|pages = 156–172|last1 = Paradise|first1 = Ruth|year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example where nonverbal behavior can be used as a learning tool can be seen in Chillihuani culture. Children in this community learn about growing crops by observing the actions and respect adults have for the land. They learn that caring for their crops is vital for them to grow and in turn for the community to thrive. Similarly, when children participate in rituals, they learn the importance of being part of the community by watching how everyone interacts. This again needs no explicit verbal communication, it relies solely on observing the world around. Chillihuani culture does not explicitly verbalize expectations. Their knowledge is experienced rather than explained through modeled behavior for community benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ennew | first1 = J | year = 2010 | title = Growing up in a culture of respect: child rearing in highland Peru – By Bolin, Inge | url = | journal = Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 168–169 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-9655.2009.01604_5.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the indigenous culture of the Matsigenka, infants are kept in close proximity to their mother and members of the community. The infant does not go far from the mother at any time. In this way, the child is encouraged to explore away from the mother and other family members who will still keep watch. As the child wanders he may come to a place that is unknown and potentially dangerous but the mother will not stop him, she will just watch as he explores. The lack of verbal reprimand or warning from an adult or elder enable the child to assimilate his surroundings more carefully.&lt;ref&gt;Ochs, E., &amp; Izquierdo, C. (n.d.). Responsibility in childhood: Three developmental trajectories.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal and informal education==
To fully understand informal learning it is useful to define the terms "formal" and "informal" education. Formal education can be defined as a setting that is highly institutionalized, can be possibly bureaucratic,  while being curriculum driven, and formally recognized with grades, diplomas, or other forms of certifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baumgartner|first1=Sharan B. Merriam, Rosemary S. Cafarella, Lisa M.|title=Learning in adulthood : a comprehensive guide|date=2007|publisher=Jossey-Bass|location=San Francisco|isbn=978-0787975883|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal education is closely tied in with informal learning, which occurs in a variety of places, such as at home, work, and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society. Informal learning often takes place outside educational establishments, and does not follow a specified curriculum and may originate accidentally, or sporadically, in association with certain occasions, although that is not always the case. Informal education can occur in the formal arena when concepts are adapted to the unique needs of individual students.

==Research and data==
Merriam and others (2007) state: "studies of informal learning, especially those asking about adults' self-directed learning projects, reveal that upwards of 90 percent of adults are engaged in hundreds of hours of informal learning. It has also been estimated that the great majority (upwards of 70 percent) of learning in the workplace is informal (Kim, Collins, Hagedorn, Williamson, &amp; Chapman, 2004), although billions of dollars each year are spent by business and industry on formal training programs" (p.&amp;nbsp;35–36). Both formal and informal learning are considered integral processes for Virtual Human Resource Development (Bennett, 2009), with informal learning the stronger form.

==Experiences and examples==
Informal knowledge is information that has not been externalized or captured and the primary locus of the knowledge may be inside someone's head. (Grebow, David, "At the Water Cooler of Learning" in Conner, M. L., &amp; Clawson, J.G. (eds.) "Transforming Culture: An Executive Briefing on the Power of Learning", Charlottesville: University of Virginia, 2002). For example, in the cause of [[language acquisition]], a mother may teach a child basic concepts of grammar and language at home, prior to the child entering a 
formal education system (Eaton, Sarah (2011). "Family Literacy and the New Canadian: Formal, Non-Formal and .Informal Learning: The Case of Literacy, Essential Skills and Language Learning in Canada"). In such a case, the mother has a tacit understanding of language structures, syntax and morphology, but she may not be explicitly aware of what these are. She understands the language and passes her knowledge on to her offspring.

Other examples of informal knowledge transfer include instant messaging, a spontaneous meeting on the Internet, a phone call to someone who has information you need, a live one-time-only sales meeting introducing a new product, a chat-room in real time, a chance meeting by the water cooler, a scheduled Web-based meeting with a real-time agenda, a tech walking you through a repair process, or a meeting with your assigned mentor or manager.

Experience indicates that much of the learning for performance is informal (The Institute for Research on Learning, 2000, Menlo Park). Those who transfer their knowledge to a learner are usually present in real time. Such learning can take place over the telephone or through the Internet, as well as in person.

In the UK, the government formally recognized the benefits of informal learning in "The Learning Revolution" White Paper published on March 23, 2009 (Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, 2009). The Learning Revolution Festival ran in October 2009 and funding has been used by libraries—which offer a host of informal learning opportunities such as book groups, "meet the author" events and family history sessions—to run activities such as [http://www.northeastlibraries.org.uk The North East Festival of Learning].

==Trends in formal and informal learning==
40% of adults have self-taught themselves at some point and respondents in a survey indicated that they were twice as likely to participate in independent learning as traditional learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The average adult spends 10 hours a week (500 hours a year) on informal learning practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Livingstone|first1=D.W.|title=Informal Learning: Conceptual Distinctions and Preliminary Findings|journal=Counterpoints|date=2006|volume=249|pages=203–227}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a whole, this type of knowledge is more learner-centered and [[situational]] in response to the interests or needed application of the skill to a particular workforce. Formal training programs have limited success in increasing basic skills for individuals older than age 25, therefore, these individuals rely mostly on [[on-the-job training]].

Although rates of formal education have increased, many adults entering the workforce are lacking the basic math, reading and [[interpersonal skills]] that the “unskilled” labor force requires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lines between formal and informal learning have been blurred due to the higher rates of college attendance. The largest increase in population for manual or low-skilled labor is in individuals who attended college but did not receive a degree. A recent collection of cross-sectional surveys were conducted and polled employers across the United States to gauge which skills are required for jobs which do not require college degrees. These surveys concluded that 70% require some kind of customer service aspect, 61% require reading or writing paragraphs, 65% require math, 51% require the use of computers. In regards to training and academic credentials, 71% require a high school diploma, 61% require specific vocational experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lerman|first1=Robert I.|last2=Schmidt|first2=Stefanie R.|title=The Low-Skilled Labor Market|url=https://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/history/herman/reports/futurework/conference/trends/trendsVII.htm|website=US Department of Labor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rates of men entering the low-skilled labor force have remained static over the last fifty years, indicating a shift of less than 1%. Women’s participation in the unskilled labor force has steadily increased and projections indicate that this trend will continue.

==Business perspective==
The majority of companies that provide training are currently involved only with the formal side of the continuum. Most of today's investments are on the formal side. The net result is that companies spend the most money on the smallest part—25%—of the learning equation. The other 75% of learning happens as the learner creatively "adopts and adapts to ever changing circumstances". The informal piece of the equation is not only larger, it's crucial to learning how to do anything.

==Summary==
Lifelong learning, as defined by the [[OECD]], includes a combination of formal, non-formal and informal learning. Of these three, informal learning may be the most difficult to quantify or prove, but it remains critical to an individual's overall cognitive and social development throughout the lifespan.

The '''Klein Sexual Orientation Grid''' ('''KSOG''') developed by [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]] attempts to measure [[sexual orientation]] by expanding upon the earlier [[Kinsey scale]]. Klein first described the KSOG in his 1978 book ''[[The Bisexual Option]]''.&lt;ref name="Coleman1987a"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coleman|first=Edmond J|title=Integrated Identity for Gay Men and Lesbians: Psychotherapeutic Approaches for Emotional Well-Being|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfXmSHMDIBgC&amp;pg=PA13|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=1987-09-10|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=9780866566384|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newitz1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=The Bad Subjects Production Team|title=Bad Subjects: Political Education for Everyday Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6inQN6MN0-AC&amp;pg=PT108|accessdate=29 August 2012|date=1997-11-01|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814757932|pages=108–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bancroft2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bancroft|first=John|title=Human Sexuality And It Problems|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bI-Jau14aLAC&amp;pg=PA262|accessdate=29 August 2012|year=2009|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780443051616|pages=262–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1985"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein|first=Fritz|author2=Barry Sepekoff |author3=Timothy J.

In response to the criticism of the Kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation, Klein developed a multidimensional grid for describing sexual orientation. Unlike the Kinsey Scale, the Klein grid investigates sexual orientation in the past, the present and in the idealized future with respect to seven factors each, for a total of twenty-one values. The KSOG uses values of 1–7, rather than the 0–6 scale of the Kinsey Scale, to describe a continuum from exclusively opposite-sex to exclusively same-sex attraction.&lt;ref name="Coleman1987b"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coleman|first=Eli|year=1987|title=Assessment of Sexual Orientation|journal=Journal of Homosexuality|volume=14|issue=1–2|pages=9–24|issn=0091-8369|doi=10.1300/J082v14n01_02|pmid=3655356}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Introduced in Klein's book ''The Bisexual Option'' the KSOG uses a seven-point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual's life: past (from early adolescence up to one year ago), present (within the last 12 months), and ideal (what would be chosen if it were voluntary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Fritz|title=The Bisexual Option|year=1993|publisher=The Haworth Press|isbn=978-1-56024-380-9|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shortcomings==
{{main|Sexual orientation#Sexual orientation distinguished from sexual identity and behavior}}
{{Criticism section|date=October 2012}}
Klein, while recognizing that the grid explored many more dimensions of sexual orientation than previous scales, acknowledged that it omitted the following aspects of sexual orientation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Fritz|title=The Bisexual Option|year=1993|pages=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Age of partner
* Differentiation of love and friendship in the emotional preference variable
* Sexual attraction being distinguished between [[sexual desire]] and [[limerence]]
* Whether [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] referred to number of partners or number of occurrences
* [[Sex role]]s as well as masculine and feminine roles

While Klein held the belief that including more dimensions of sexual orientation was better, Weinrich et al. (1993) found that all of the dimensions of the KSOG seemed to be measuring the same construct.&lt;ref name="Weinrich 1993 157–168"&gt;{{cite journal|author=J. Weinrich|title=A factor analysis of the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid in two disparate samples.|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|year=1993|volume=22|issue=2|pages=157–168|doi=10.1007/bf01542364|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study conducted a [[factor analysis]] of the KSOG to see how many factors emerged in two different samples. In both groups, the first factor to emerge loaded substantially on all of the grid's 21 items, indicating that this factor accounted for a majority of the variance. They further found that a second factor emerged containing time dimensions of social and emotional preferences suggesting that those dimensions may have also been measuring something other than sexual orientation. Therefore, despite the scale being helpful in promoting the concept of sexual orientation as being multidimensional and dynamic, the additional dimensions measured do not necessarily reveal any more of an accurate description of one's overall sexual orientation than the Kinsey Scale.

Another concern with the KSOG is that different dimensions of sexual orientation may not identify all people of a certain orientation in the same way. Measures of [[sexual attraction]], sexual activity, and [[sexual identity]] identify different (though often overlapping) populations. Laumann et al. (1994) found that of the 8.6% of women reporting some same gender sexuality, 88% reported same gender sexual attraction, 41% reported some same gender sexual behaviour and 16% reported a lesbian or gay identity.&lt;ref name="Laumann 1994 303"&gt;{{cite book|last=Laumann|title=The Social Organization of Sexuality|year=1994|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-46957-7|pages=303|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is not clear what exactly the scale may be measuring as depending on which aspect is taken into consideration, sexual orientation may or not be revealed.

A '''Language Program Director''' (LPD) is a usually senior academic position in United States universities. In some institutions a LPD can also be referred to as a 'Language Program Coordinator' (LPC), while in others the LPD has a hierarchically higher position than an LPC, the latter coordinating just one course level.

Most LPDs are not on a [[tenure]]-track because traditionally [[linguistics|linguistic studies]] have been considered by Departments of Foreign Languages and Literatures as less important than [[literary studies]]. According to a recent MLA report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mla.org/flreport Report from the MLA Ad Hoc Committee on Foreign Languages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; this is a trend that should be reversed. In the past LPD positions were generally filled by people - usually women - with degrees in literature and no training in [[second language acquisition]] or [[applied linguistics]]. This has resulted in a lack of innovation in US language programs. Recently, however, more and more universities are looking for new program directors with specific training in applied linguistics.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://web2.adfl.org/adfl/bulletin/v30n1/301052.htm Surviving the Leap from Graduate Student to Language Program Director: Issues, Challenges, Rewards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108190058/http://web2.adfl.org/adfl/bulletin/v30n1/301052.htm |date=2009-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and are offering their LPDs tenure-track positions.

The '''list of uninhabited regions''' includes a number of places around the globe. The list changes year over year as human beings migrate into formerly uninhabited regions, or migrate out of formerly inhabited regions.

==List==
As a group, the list of uninhabited places are called the "nonecumene".  This is a special geography term which means the uninhabited area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gosh, Ajay Kumar. (2005).

[[File:M-T-Cicero.jpg|thumb|[[Cicero]] discussed the method of loci in his ''[[De Oratore]]''.]]
The '''method of loci''' (''loci'' being Latin for "places") is a method of memory enhancement which uses visualizations with the use of spatial memory, familiar information about one's environment, to quickly and efficiently recall information. The method of loci is also known as the '''memory journey''', '''memory palace''', or '''mind palace technique'''. This method is a [[mnemonic]] device  adopted in [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] and [[ancient Greece|Greek]] rhetorical treatises (in the anonymous ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'', [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Oratore]]'', and [[Quintilian]]'s ''[[Institutio Oratoria]]''). Many [[Memory sport|memory contest]] champions claim to use this technique to recall faces, digits, and lists of words.

The term is most often found in specialised works on [[psychology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[memory]], though it was used in the same general way at least as early as the first half of the nineteenth century in works on [[rhetoric]], [[logic]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in a discussion of "topical memory" (yet another designator) Jamieson mentions that "memorial lines, or verses, are more useful than the method of loci." [[Alexander Jamieson]], ''A Grammar of Logic and Intellectual Philosophy'', A. H. Maltby, 1835, p112&lt;/ref&gt; [[John O'Keefe (neuroscientist)|John O'Keefe]] and [[Lynn Nadel]] refer to:&lt;blockquote&gt;'the method of loci', an imaginal technique known to the ancient Greeks and Romans and described by [[Frances Yates|Yates]] (1966) in her book ''[[The Art of Memory]]'' as well as by [[Alexander Luria|Luria]] (1969). In this technique the subject memorizes the layout of some building, or the arrangement of shops on a street, or any geographical entity which is composed of a number of discrete loci. When desiring to remember a set of items the subject 'walks' through these loci in their imagination and commits an item to each one by forming an image between the item and any feature of that locus. Retrieval of items is achieved by 'walking' through the loci, allowing the latter to activate the desired items. The efficacy of this technique has been well established (Ross and Lawrence 1968, Crovitz 1969, 1971, Briggs, Hawkins and Crovitz 1970, Lea 1975), as is the minimal interference seen with its use.&lt;ref name="cognitivemap"&gt;{{cite book| last1 = O'Keefe| first1 =John |last2 = Nadel |first2 =Lynn| authorlink2 = Lynn Nadel  | title =The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map'| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = December 7, 1978| location = Oxford|url =http://www.cognitivemap.net | isbn = 978-0198572060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The items to be remembered in this mnemonic system are mentally associated with specific physical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Psychology the science of behaviour|year=2010|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|isbn=9780205645244|pages=245}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The method relies on memorized spatial relationships to establish order and recollect memorial content. It is also known as the "Journey Method", used for storing lists of related items, or the "Roman Room" technique, which is most effective for storing unrelated information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Roman Room Technique| work = AcademicTips.org| url =http://www.academictips.org/memory/romanrom.html| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary usage==
Many effective memorisers today use the "method of loci" to some degree. Contemporary memory competition, in particular the [[World Memory Championship]], was initiated in 1991 and the first [[USA Memory Championship|United States championship]] was held in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Foer| first =Joshua| authorlink =Joshua Foer| title =Forget Me Not: How to win the U.S. memory championship| work =[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]| date = March 16, 2005| url =http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/dispatches/2005/03/forget_me_not.single.html| accessdate = October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the competition requires committing to memory and recalling a sequence of digits, two-digit numbers, alphabetic letters, or playing cards. In a simple method of doing this, contestants, using various strategies well before competing, commit to [[long-term memory]] a unique vivid image associated with each item. They have also committed to long-term memory a familiar route with firmly established stop-points or loci. Then in the competition they need only deposit the image that they have associated with each item at the loci. To recall, they retrace the route, "stop" at each locus, and "observe" the image. They then translate this back to the associated item. For example, Ed Cooke, a World Memory Champion Competitor, describes to Josh Foer in his book ''[[Moonwalking with Einstein]]'' how he uses the method of loci. First, he describes a very familiar location where he can clearly remember many different smaller locations like his sink in his childhood home or his dog's bed. Cooke also advises that the more outlandish and vulgar the symbol used to memorize the material, the more likely it will stick.

Memory champions elaborate on this by combining images. Eight-time [[World Memory Champion]] [[Dominic O'Brien]] uses this technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 1997 World Memory Championships| work = Mind Sports Worldwide| url =http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514121614/http://www.msoworld.com/brain/mental/memory97_2.html| archivedate = May 14, 2011| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mt.artofmemory.com/wiki/Memory_Town_System_for_Languages|title=Memory Town System for Languages - Memory Techniques Wiki|author=|date=|website=mt.artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 [[World Memory Champion]], [[Clemens Mayer]], used a 300-point-long journey through his house for his world record in "number half marathon", memorising 1040 random digits in a half-hour. Gary Shang has used the method of loci to memorise [[pi]] to over 65,536 (2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) digits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Using this technique a person with ordinary memorisation capabilities, after establishing the route stop-points and committing the associated images to long-term memory, with less than an hour of practice, can remember the sequence of a shuffled deck of cards. {{cn|date=September 2017}} The world record for this is held by Simon Reinhard at 21.19 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 5 Minute Speed Cards| work = World Memory Statistics| publisher = World Memory Sports Council| url =http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/discipline.php?id=spdcards| accessdate =October 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is taught as a metacognitive technique in learning-to-learn courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn|title=Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects - Coursera|author=|date=|website=Coursera}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally applied to encoding the key ideas of a subject. Two approaches are:
# Link the key ideas of a subject and then deep-learn those key ideas in relation to each other, and
# Think through the key ideas of a subject in depth, re-arrange the ideas in relation to an argument, then link the ideas to loci in good order.

The method of loci has also been shown to help sufferers of [[Major depressive disorder | depression]] remember positive, self-affirming memories.&lt;ref name="Dagleish"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dalgleish |first=Tim |last2=Navrady |first2=Lauren |last3=Bird |first3=Elinor |last4=Hill |first4=Emma |last5=Dunn |first5=Barnaby D. |last6=Golden |first6=Ann-Marie |date=12 February 2013 |title=Method-of-Loci as a Mnemonic Device to Facilitate Access to Self-Affirming Personal Memories for Individuals With Depression |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2167702612468111 |journal=Clinical Psychological Science |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=156–162 |doi=10.1177/2167702612468111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the University of Maryland evaluated participants ability to accurately recall two sets of familiar faces, using a traditional desktop, and with a head-mounted display. The study was designed to leverage the method of loci technique, with virtual environments resembling memory palaces. The study found an 8.8% recall improvement in favor of the head-mounted display, in part due to participants being able to leverage their vestibular and proprioceptive sensations.&lt;ref name="EKrokos"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Krokos|first=Eric|last2=Plaisant|first2=Catherine|last3=Varshney|first3=Amitabh |date=16 May 2018|title=Virtual Memory Palaces: Immersion Aids Recall|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3 |pages=1-15 |doi=10.1007/s10055-018-0346-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==
The ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' and most other sources recommend that the method of loci should be integrated with [[elaborative encoding]] (i.e., adding visual, auditory, or other details) to strengthen memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/research/memoria/Ad_Herennium_Passages.html|title=Rhetorica ad Herennium Passages on Memory|first=Douglas Boin/Karl|last=Galinsky|date=|website=www.utexas.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/quintillian-on-memory-109.html|title=Quintilian on Memory - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=25 November 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the strength of spatial memory, simply mentally placing objects in real or imagined locations without further elaboration can be effective for simple associations.

A variation of the "method of loci" involves creating imaginary locations (houses, palaces, roads, and cities) to which the same procedure is applied. It is accepted that there is a greater cost involved in the initial setup, but thereafter the performance is in line with the standard loci method. The purported advantage is to create towns and cities that each represent a topic or an area of study, thus offering an efficient filing of the information and an easy path for the regular review necessary for long term memory storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bremer| first = Rod| title =The Manual - A guide to the Ultimate Study Method (USM)| publisher =  Fons Sapientiae Publishing | date = September 20, 2011| location = Cambridge, United Kingdom| isbn = 978-0956990709}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/memory-techniques-brazilian-portuguese-795.html|title=New Project: Use Memory Techniques to Learn Brazilian Portuguese - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=18 December 2010|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Something that is likely a reference to the "method of loci" techniques survives to this day in the common English phrases "in the first place", "in the second place", and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Finger| first =Stanley| title =Origins of Neuroscience: A History of Explorations Into Brain Function| publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]| date = October 11, 2001| location = Oxford| pages = 333 | isbn = 978-0195146943}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.artofmemory.com/first-place-second-place-5806.html|title="In the First Place, in the Second Place" - Art of Memory Blog|author=|date=12 January 2015|website=artofmemory.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is also used for second language vocabulary learning, as polyglot [[Timothy Doner]] described in his 2014 [[TED (conference)|TED]] talk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donor|first1=Timothy|title=Breaking the language barrier|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNmf-G81Irs|accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is further described in Anthony Metiver's book "How to learn and memorise German vocabulary". What the author suggests is creating a memory palace for each letter of the German alphabet. Each memory palace then shall include a number of loci where an entry (a word or a phrase) can be stored and recalled whenever you need it.

==Applicability of the term==
The designation is not used with strict consistency. In some cases it refers broadly to what is otherwise known as the [[art of memory]], [[Art of memory#Origins and history|the origins of which are related]], according to tradition, in the story of [[Simonides of Ceos]] and the collapsing banquet hall.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Yates, ''The Art of Memory'', University of Chicago, 1966, p1-2&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after relating the story of how Simonides relied on remembered seating arrangements to call to mind the faces of recently deceased guests, Stephen M. Kosslyn remarks "[t]his insight led to the development of a technique the Greeks called the method of loci, which is a systematic way of improving one's memory by using imagery."&lt;ref&gt;Stephen M. Kosslyn, "Imagery in Learning" in: Michael S. Gazzaniga (Ed.), ''Perspectives in Memory Research'', MIT Press, 1988,  p245; it should be noted that Kosslyn fails to cite any example of the use of an equivalent term in period Greek or Latin sources.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Skoyles (scientist)|Skoyles]] and [[Dorion Sagan|Sagan]] indicate that "an ancient technique of memorization called Method of Loci, by which memories are referenced directly onto spatial maps" originated with the story of Simonides.&lt;ref&gt;John Robert Skoyles, Dorion Sagan, ''Up From Dragons: The Evolution of Human Intelligence'', McGraw-Hill, 2002, p150&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to mnemonic methods, Verlee Williams mentions, "One such strategy is the 'loci' method, which was developed by Simonides, a Greek poet of the fifth and sixth centuries BC."&lt;ref&gt;Linda Verlee Williams, ''Teaching For The Two-Sided Mind: A Guide to Right Brain/Left Brain Education'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986, p110&lt;/ref&gt; Loftus cites the [[foundation story]] of Simonides (more or less taken from [[The Art of Memory|Frances Yates]]) and describes some of the most basic aspects of the use of space in the [[art of memory]]. She states, "This particular mnemonic technique has come to be called the "method of loci".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth F. Loftus, ''Human Memory: The Processing of Information'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1976, p65&lt;/ref&gt; While place or position certainly figured prominently in ancient mnemonic techniques, no designation equivalent to "method of loci" was used exclusively to refer to mnemonic schemes relying upon space for organization.&lt;ref&gt;For example, Aristotle referred to ''topoi'' (places) in which memorial content could be aggregated - hence our modern term "topics", while another primary classical source, ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'' (Bk III) discusses rules for places ''and'' images. In general Classical and Medieval sources describe these techniques as the art or arts of memory (''ars memorativa'' or ''artes memorativae''), rather than as any putative "method of loci". Nor is the imprecise designation current in specialized historical studies, for example Mary Carruthers uses the term "architectural mnemonic" to describe what is otherwise designated "method of loci".&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases the designation is generally consistent, but more specific: "The Method of Loci is a Mnemonic Device involving the creation of a Visual Map of one's house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Gutman| first =Sharon A.| title =Quick Reference Neuroscience For Rehabilitation Professionals| publisher = SLACK Incorporated| date = December 1, 2007 |location =Thorofare, New Jersey| pages = 216| isbn =978-1556428005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This term can be misleading: the ancient principles and techniques of the [[art of memory]], hastily glossed in some of the works, cited above, depended equally upon images ''and'' places. The designator "method of loci" does not convey the equal weight placed on both elements. Training in the art or arts of memory as a whole, as attested in classical antiquity, was far more inclusive and comprehensive in the treatment of this subject.

== Spatial mnemonics and specific brain activation ==

Brain scans of "superior memorizers", 90% of whom use the method of loci technique, have shown that it involves activation of regions of the brain involved in spatial awareness, such as the [[Parietal lobe|medial parietal cortex]], [[retrosplenial cortex]], and the [[Hippocampus|right posterior hippocampus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Patients who have medial parietal cortex damage have trouble linking landmarks with certain locations; many of these patients are unable to give or follow directions and often get lost. The retrosplenial cortex is also linked to memory and navigation.  In one study on the effects of selective granular retrosplenial cortex lesions in rats, the researcher found that damage to the retrosplenial cortex led to impaired spatial learning abilities. Rats with damage to this area failed to recall which areas of the maze they had already visited, rarely explored different arms of the maze, almost never recalled the maze in future trials, and took longer to reach the end of the maze, as compared to rats with a fully working retrosplenial cortex.

In a classic study in cognitive [[neuroscience]], O'Keefe and Nadel proposed "that the hippocampus is the core of a neural memory system providing an objective spatial framework within which the items and events of an organism's experience are located and interrelated."&lt;ref This theory has generated considerable debate and further experiment. It has been noted that "[t]he hippocampus underpins our ability to navigate, to form and recollect memories, and to imagine future experiences. How activity across millions of hippocampal [[neurons]] supports these functions is a fundamental question in neuroscience, wherein the size, sparseness, and organization of the hippocampal neural code are debated.":&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a more recent study, memory champions during resting periods did not exhibit specific regional brain differences, but distributed functional brain network connectivity changes compared to control subjects. When volunteers trained use of the method of loci for six weeks, the training-induced changes in brain connectivity were similar to the brain network organization that distinguished memory champions from controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Fictional portrayals ==
Fictional portrayals of the method of loci extend as far back as [[Greek mythology|ancient Greek myths]]. The method of loci also features prominently in the [[BBC]] series  ''[[Sherlock (TV series)|Sherlock]]'', in which the titular main character uses a "mind palace" to store information. In the original [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] stories, [[Sherlock Holmes]] referred to his [[brain]] as an [[attic]].&lt;ref name="Zielinski18"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zielinski|first1=Sarah|title=The Secrets of Sherlock’s Mind Palace|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/secrets-sherlocks-mind-palace-180949567/|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=Smithsonian|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Hannibal Rising]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], a detailed description of [[Hannibal Lecter]]'s memory palace is provided.&lt;ref name="harris-thomas-hanibal-rising"&gt;{{cite book |last=Harris|first=Thomas|year=2006|title=[[Hannibal Rising]]|location=United States|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|isbn=0385339410|pages=1-2,167,178-179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martinez-conde-susana-sciam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez-Conde|first=Susana|title=Neuroscience in Fiction: Hannibal Lecter's Memory Palace|date=April 26, 2013|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/illusion-chasers/hannibal-lecter/|work=Scientific American|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{original research|date=May 2018}}
'''''Miguxês''''' ({{IPA-pt|miɡuˈʃes}} or {{IPA-pt|miɣuˈʃeʃ|}}), also known in [[Portugal]] as '''''pita talk''''' or '''''pita script''''' (&lt;small&gt;pronounced &lt;/small&gt;{{IPA-pt|ˈpitɐ|}}), is an [[Internet slang]] of the [[Portuguese language]], commonly used by mostly [[Brazil]]ian teenagers in [[Internet]] and other electronic media, such as messages written in [[cell phone]].

==Brief history==

Its name derives from ''miguxo'', a corruption from ''amiguxo'', turn a term used for ''amiguinho'', or "buddy" in Portuguese. This [[sociolect]] of Vernacular [[Brazilian Portuguese]] brings possible simplifications in the grammatical structures, since the vehicles in which ''miguxês'' is used are nearly universally colloquial, often space-delimited (such as [[SMS message]]s, [[instant messenger]]s or [[social network]]s). It also tends to have "simpler" orthography in comparison to standard Portuguese orthography, which leads to the most strong criticism to it (''miguxês'' without its common alternative spellings is associated with the just normal Internet and/or youth slang).

There are identitarian and orthographic differences between the so-called [[leet]]speak, ''miguxês'', ''tiopês'' and ''internetês'' — Brazilian Portuguese for [[netspeak]], which is by far the one that most closely resembles standard Portuguese —, all common sociolects found in the Portuguese-speaking digital network community, the three latter ones created in it.

Basically, the use of each category depends on the individual choice and the environment in which people are interacting. While in the Internet, in a general manner, there is a handful of a different phenomenon in which users communicate with abbreviations to simplify writing, ''miguxês'' carries with it an effective intention, that is, to express an infantile language in a conversation between friends, or even satirize this style of communication. In certain subcultures in Brazil, especially in the case of what is called '[[emo]]' there, ''miguxês'' is an item of group identification. So it would not be unusual for someone which opposes such subcultures to also develop a distaste for ''miguxês''. Brazilian '[[Emo#Backlash|anti-emo]]' groups usually satirize 'emo' teenagers with use of ''miguxês''.

Together with the cited urban tribes, they started to fell out of the mainstream in the early 2010s, so that they have much lower popularity with the following teen generation that did not see its spreading as a frequent Internet meme.

==Spelling==

Although orthography rules of ''miguxês'' may vary individually, and also in each region and in different [[urban tribe]]s since it is plain broken Portuguese, there are certain characteristics often commonly found as:

* Replacement of ''s'' and ''c'' for ''x'', simulating the [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of native Portuguese-speaking children's speech through their language acquisition: ''você'' (Second person singular), ''vocês'' (Second person plural) &gt; ''vuxeh'', ''vuxeix'';
* Omission or replacement of [[diacritics]], notably by replacing an acute accent over a vowel with the letter ''h'' after the vowel as in ''é'' ("is") &gt; ''eh'' (to distinguish it from the word ''e'' meaning "and") or ''será'' ("will be") &gt; ''serah''. Or replacing the [[tilde]] with ''n''/''m'' to indicate nasalization: ''não'' ("no") &gt; ''nawn''/''naum''
* Replacement of ''i'' by ''ee'', influenced by [[English language]] orthography: ''gatinha'' (female kitten, also a slang for pretty girl) &gt; ''gateenha'';
* Replacement of ''o'' and ''e'' by ''u'' and ''i'' respectively, specially in non-tonic syllables: ''quero'' (I want) &gt; ''keru''.
* Replacing the digraph ''qu'' and the letter ''c'' as ''k'' both for brevity and as a form of [[sensational spelling]], and deleting the ''u'' of these environments: ''quem'' (who), ''escreveu'' (wrote) &gt; ''kem'', ''ixkrevew''

==Tiopês==
[[2010s in fashion#Youth fashion|Brazilian indie and scene kids]] use a related Internet sociolect, the ''tiopês'' (from ''tiop'', which is a corruption of Portuguese ''tipo'', or equivalent to English "like, totally", in ''tiopês''), which mainly uses [[ingroup]] [[Internet meme|meme]]s as well purposeful ridiculous-sounding [[Spelling#Misspellings|misspellings]] to add humor or irony to the message and bring group identification, much like [[teh]] of English-derived leetspeak.&lt;ref&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://youpix.com.br/memepedia/a-origem-do-tiopes/ The origin of "tiopês" – memepedia – youPIX, people + pixels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010130045/http://youpix.com.br/memepedia/a-origem-do-tiopes/ |date=2012-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it is common for the ''miguxês'', there are detractors of ''tiopês'', although much less numbered and for different reasons (usually, people which are detractors at the same time of different youth subcultures deemed as alienated, including 'emo' teenagers, [[2000–2009 in fashion#Youth fashion|scene kids]] and [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|indie kids]]). ''Tiopês'' is also much less common in the Portuguese-speaking Internet community, and is said to be a phenomenon limited to Brazil.

===Example===
* Tiopês: amiogs, eo tiop a~mo a dercycolpëdya, rsrsrs1!!11! o artigo deels sorb noës indys eh tuod mas asi~m meninës nein toads os saitys de parödjas soa lezgaus tiop augums pormoven ~polëmicas~ conmo precomseiots e eu noa asho iso valiod un boa~m eggzenpel ~master no ingreis AEAEAEAE~ seriä a tau da emceeclopëdia dramatchyca q aepzar do noem noa shorem leëtros pro sel fin11!11!
* Rough colloquial Brazilian Portuguese translation of the ''tiopês'' piece: Gente, eu absolutamente adoro a Desciclopédia, hahahaha, o artigo deles sobre nós indies é tudo, mas tenho algo a dizer a vocês, nem todos os ''sites'' de paródia são legais, alguns deles promovem coisas controversas como preconceitos, e eu não acho esse tipo de coisa válida, um bom exemplo seria uma certa Encyclopedia Dramatica que apesar do nome, não é de se sofrer um drama por seu fim.
* English, literal translation of the Portuguese piece: You guys, I [have to tell that I] absolutely love/adore [[Uncyclopedia]], hahahaha, their [Portuguese] article on us indie kids is awesome, but I have something to say [to you], not every parody site is cool, some of them promote controversial things such as [a number of] prejudices, and I am reticent of [all] this kind of thing, a good example would be a so-called [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] that in spite of its name, would not be worth of a drama because of its end.

The '''North South Atlantic Training Transect''' (NoSoAT) is a program that was developed by the [[Alfred Wegener Institute]] (AWI), the [[Strategic Marine Alliance for Research and Training]] (SMART), and the [[Partnership for Observation of the Global Oceans]] (POGO) in order to further the education and practical training of postgraduate students in climate and [[marine science]]s. Each year, about 30 students are selected through a rigorous application process to join a voyage from [[Bremerhaven]], Germany to [[Cape Town]], South Africa aboard the [[RV Polarstern]]. The month-long course is designed to provide students with relevant lectures and projects, as well as provide them with hands-on training for the use of atmospheric and oceanographic equipment and the opportunity to learn about data processing and analysis.&lt;ref name=MIFnM&gt;{{cite web|title=Apply now to join North South Atlantic Training Transect (NoSoAT 2016) {{!}} Marine Institute|url=http://www.marine.ie/Home/site-area/news-events/news/apply-now-join-north-south-atlantic-training-transect-nosoat-2016|website=Marine Institute Foras na Mara|accessdate=2 November 2016|date=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Call Closed: North South Atlantic Training Transect 2016 {{!}} SMART|url=http://www.smartseaschool.com/nosoat2016|website=Strategic Marine Alliance for Research and Training|accessdate=2 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Results from Previous Cruises ==
Each cruise has a unique focus, varying as topics become more or less important.

=== NoSoAT 2015 - Expeditions PS95.1 and PS95.2 ===
The cruise track covers a broad range of habitats for various organisms and a broad range of characteristically different waters. Data collected during this cruise came from equipment such as a [[CTD (instrument)|Conductivity, Temperature, and Depth (CTD) Sonde]], a [[Bongonet]], a [[Ferrybox]], and a [[Continuous Plankton Recorder]] (CPR). Additionally, samples of [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] were obtained and analyzed in conjunction with satellite data. Some preliminary results included the identification of three distinct water masses along the [[transect]], discrepancies in the comparison of ship-board [[chlorophyll a]] measurements with satellite-derived chlorophyll a data, latitudinal variations in the depth of the chlorophyll a maximum, and variations in the impact of [[microzooplankton]] grazing on phytoplankton communities.&lt;ref name=Expedition2015/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12693">The '''Planetary Collegium''' is an international research platform that promotes the integration of art, science, technology, and consciousness research, under the rubric of ''technoetic arts''.  It is currently based in [[Plymouth University]]. The Collegium's Hub is the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in Integrative Arts (CAiiA), and it has had nodes in Zurich, Milan, Lucerne, Trento, Kefalonia, and currently in Shanghai. The founding President is Professor [[Roy Ascott]].
[[File:Logo for The Planetary Collegium.jpg|thumb|Planetary Collegium logo]]

== History ==
The Planetary Collegium was  conceived and established by [[Roy Ascott]] as the ''Centre for Advanced Inquiry in the Interactive Arts'' ('''CAiiA''')  in 1994 at what is now the [[University of Wales, Newport]] 

Three years later, Ascott established '''STAR''' (Science Technology and Art Research) in the School of Computing, University of Plymouth. '''CAiiA-STAR''' constituted a joint research platform, with access to supervisory and technical resources of both universities.

In 2003, Ascott contracted to relocate the platform to [[Plymouth University]], renaming it the '''Planetary Collegium''', where it is currently located in the Faculty of Arts and Humanities. The contract with Plymouth University expires in July 2021, when Ascott plans to relocate it in China. 

Since 1997, the Collegium has given more than seventy conferences and symposia in Europe, North and South America, Japan, China and Australia.

Since its inception, first at the University of Wales, and currently at Plymouth,  over 80 doctoral candidates have graduated from the programme. 

==Aims==
The Collegium aims to produce new knowledge in the context of the arts, through transdisciplinary inquiry and critical discourse, with special reference to [[technoetic]] research and to advances in science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/artist/ascott/biography/|title=Media Art Net - Ascott, Roy: Biography|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its seeks to reflect the social, technological and spiritual aspirations of an emerging planetary society, while sustaining a critical awareness of the retrograde forces and fields that inhibit social and cultural development. It combines the face-to-face association of individuals with the trans-cultural unity of telematic communities, thereby developing a network of research nodes strategically located across the planet, each with a distinctive cultural ethos. The Collegium seeks outcomes that involve new language, systems, structures, and behaviours, and insights into the nature of mind, matter and human identity. 

== Structure ==
As conceived and directed by Ascott, the Planetary Collegium consists of artists, theoreticians and scholars working within the context of [[transdisciplinarity]] and [[syncretism]] so as to develop their research in the practice and theory of [[new media art]] with a special interest in [[telematics]] and [[technoetics]]. Currently, their doctoral research leads to the award of the '''University of Plymouth PhD'''. Post-doctoral research is also pursued. It has attracted an impressive number of internationally well-established artists, musicians, performers, designers, architects, theorists and scholars involved in doctoral and post-doctoral research.

Currently, the hub of the Collegium, '''CAiiA-Hub''' (the Centre for Advanced Inquiry in Integrative Arts) is situated in the School of Art and Media, Faculty of Arts, [[Plymouth University]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated464"&gt;Kristine Stiles &amp; Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 464&lt;/ref&gt; The Collegium has a Node '''De Tao-Node''' [http://www.detao-node.com] in Shanghai. The programme, which is largely part-time, has a virtually 100% success rate, with well over 80 doctoral graduates .

In addition to doctoral candidates and graduates, supervisors and honorary members, its constituency also includes general members, who share the aims and interests of the Collegium, and are invited to participate in its development

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">'''''Postminimalism''''' is an art term coined (as '''''post-minimalism''''') by [[Robert Pincus-Witten]] in 1971&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;Chilvers, Ian and Glaves-Smith, John, ''A Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art'', second edition (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 569. {{ISBN|0199239665}}.&lt;/ref&gt; used in various artistic fields for work which is influenced by, or attempts to develop and go beyond, the aesthetic of [[minimalism]]. The expression is used specifically in relation to music and the visual arts, but can refer to any field using minimalism as a critical reference point.  
In music, ''postminimalism'' refers to music following [[minimal music]].

==Visual art==
{{See also|List of postminimalist artists}}
In visual art, postminimalist art uses minimalism either as an aesthetic or conceptual reference point. Postminimalism is more an artistic tendency than a particular movement.  Postminimalist artworks are usually everyday objects, use simple materials, and sometimes take on a "pure", [[Formalism (art)|formalist]] aesthetic. However, since postminimalism includes such a diverse and disparate group of artists, it is impossible to enumerate all the continuities and similarities between them.

The work of [[Eva Hesse]] is also postminimalist: it uses "grids" and "seriality", themes often found in minimalism, but is also usually hand-made, introducing a human element into her art, in contrast to the machine or custom-made works of minimalism. [[Richard Serra]] is a prominent post-minimalist.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Roberta (April 14, 2011). "[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/arts/design/richard-serras-drawings-at-metropolitan-museum-of-art.html?pagewanted=all Richard Serra's Drawings at Metropolitan Museum of Art]", ''NYTimes.com''. Accessed 8 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Mamoru Fujieda]]. See [[WP:MOS#Section management]] --&gt;&lt;!--[[Postminimalism (music)]] and [[Postminimal music]] redirect directly here.--&gt;
{{See also|List of postminimalist composers}} 
In its general musical usage, ''postminimalism'' refers to works influenced by [[minimal music]], and it is generally categorized within the meta-genre [[art music]]. Writer [[Kyle Gann]]&lt;ref name="Gann2001"&gt;Kyle Gann. 2001. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604040811/http://www.newmusicbox.org/article.nmbx?id=1536 Minimal Music, Maximal Impact: Minimalism's Immediate Legacy: Postminimalism]". ''New Music Box: The Web Magazine from the American Music Center'' (November 1) (Accessed 4 February 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; has employed the term more strictly to denote the style that flourished in the 1980s and 1990s and characterized by: 
#a steady [[pulse (music)|pulse]], usually continuing throughout a work or movement; 
#a [[diatonic scale|diatonic]] pitch language, [[tonality|tonal]] in effect but avoiding traditional [[diatonic function|functional tonality]]; 
#general evenness of [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], without strong climaxes or nuanced emotionalism; and 
#unlike [[minimalism]], an avoidance of obvious or linear formal design.

Minimalist procedures such as [[additive rhythm and divisive rhythm|additive]] and subtractive [[process music|process]] are common in postminimalism, though usually in disguised form, and the style has also shown a capacity for absorbing influences from world and popular music ([[Balinese gamelan]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], Jewish [[cantillation]], and so on). 

For a musical style derived from minimalism, see [[Totalism (music)]].

'''Radio Progreso &amp; ERIC-SJ''' (''Equipo de Reflexión, Investigación y Comunicación'' – ERIC) is a [[Jesuit]] center for reflection, research, and communications, founded in [[El Progreso]], [[Honduras]], in 1980. Its stated aim is to improve the human rights of the rural poor in Honduras.&lt;ref name=cpal/&gt; Its work has been extended to the rest of [[Central America]].

==History==
Honduras ranks second from the bottom in all of [[Latin America]] in per capita [[GDP]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalpropertyguide.com/Latin-America/gdp-per-capita|title=GDP per Capita in Latin-America {{!}} Real GDP per Capita in Latin-America|last=Guide|first=Global Property|website=www.globalpropertyguide.com|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has the highest per capita homicide rate in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/VC.IHR.PSRC.P5|title=Intentional homicides (per 100,000 people) {{!}} Data|website=data.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; ERIC-SJ began from an initiative of Fernando Bandeiram, S.J., as a service to the Catholic parishes around El Progresso, [[Yoro]] District, to help the people reflect on the situation of their country as it impacted them.&lt;ref name=cpal/&gt; In May 1980 three other Jesuits joined Bandeiram and founded the Reflection, Research and Communication Center at what became Casa San Ignacio at the Jesuit property in El Progresso.

Courses were offered on the "national reality" and a monthly newsletter was published focused especially on the [[Catholic Church]] in Latin America. Services were extended to the clergy in [[San Pedro Sula]], [[Copán Department]], and to the general meetings of CONFEREH, which brings together religious congregations that work against human trafficking in Central America.&lt;ref name=cpal/&gt;

Early works included dissemination throughout Central America of a denunciation of the massacre allegedly carried out by the El Salvadoran National Guard on the banks of the [[Sumpul River]] in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=cpal/&gt; This was followed by efforts to organize the [[Jicaque people]] in [[Yoro]], [[Olanchito]], and [[Morazán Department]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, assisting them with their land titles.&lt;ref name=cpal&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cpalsocial.org/centro_134.html|title=ERIC - Equipo de reflexión, investigación y comunicación|newspaper=cpalsocial.org|language=es-CO|access-date=2016-12-12}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Berta Cáceres]], who became world prominent for her efforts to secure water rights for the people and was assassinated for her efforts, was "working in alliance with the parishes of Atlántida and the ERIC and Radio Progreso, initiatives of the Jesuit Ismael Moreno"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presenciaadsis.org/berta-caceres-mujer-indigena-y-cristiana/|title=Berta Cáceres. Mujer indígena y cristiana – Presencia Adsis|website=www.presenciaadsis.org|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://eleconomista.com.mx/internacional/2016/03/05/despiden-ambientalista-berta-caceres-honduras|title=Despiden a la ambientalista Berta Cáceres en Honduras|last=Afp|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univision.com/noticias/asesinatos/miles-asisten-al-sepelio-de-la-am Univision. Accessed 14 December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the station and center today includes grassroots radio programming, training on human rights, urging greater government transparency and accountability, community organizing and empowerment, combating violence against women, formation of leadership committed to social change, and assisting returned migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cafodca.org/contrapartes/11/|title=Equipo de Reflexión, Investigación y Comunicación / Radio Progreso|website=cafodca.org|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of the 2009 coup in Honduras, Jesuits from around Latin America met and expressed their support of ERIC-SJ efforts to oppose the killings and restore constitutional government to Honduras. Signatories to the document included the farmers' rights groups [[Center for Research and Promotion of Farmers|CIPCA]] in Bolivia, [[Instituto Mayor Campesino|IMCA]] in Colombia, CEPAG in Paraguay, and ALBOAN in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cedoh.org/publicaciones/articulos/files/A mecate corto.pdf CEDOH. Accessed 14 December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

ERIC also represents Honduras in hearings before the [[Inter-American Commission on Human Rights]], as in cases involving intrusion by mining and energy companies on the water rights of local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aida-americas.org/organizations-testify-inter-american-commission-human-rights-regarding-systematic-violation-of-the-right-to-water|title=NGOs testify before IACHR regarding violation of the right to water by extractive activities|date=2015-10-26|newspaper=AIDA|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Randolph–Macon College''' is a private, [[co-education]]al [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] located in [[Ashland, Virginia]], [[United States]], near the capital city of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. Founded in 1830, the school has an enrollment of more than 1,400 students. The college offers [[bachelor's degree]]s in 38 major disciplines in the [[liberal arts]], including [[political science]], [[business]], [[psychology]], [[biology]], [[international relations|international studies]], and [[computer science]], as well as 34 minors, including [[education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rmc.edu/Academics.aspx |title=Academics: Majors &amp; Minors |publisher=Randolph-Macon College |accessdate=June 11, 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140611125002/http://www.rmc.edu/Academics.aspx |archive-date=2014-06-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Randolph–Macon College is a member of the [[Annapolis Group]] of colleges in the United States, as well as the Virginia Foundation for Independent Colleges.

== History ==
Randolph–Macon was founded in 1830 by the Virginia [[Methodists]] and is the second-oldest Methodist-run college in the country. It was originally located in [[Boydton, Virginia|Boydton]], near the [[North Carolina]] border; but as the railroad link to Boydton was destroyed during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the college's trustees decided to relocate the school to Ashland in 1868. The college takes its name from Virginia statesmen [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] and North Carolina statesman [[Nathaniel Macon]]. (The original site of Randolph–Macon features a historical marker and ruins of the classroom buildings.)

In 1847, Randolph–Macon College established a relationship with the [[Hampden–Sydney College]]. The relationship led to the formation of the Randolph–Macon Medical School, which closed in 1851.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.markeroni.com/catalog/display.php?code=VA_F_069 Landmarks Visited Catalog: Randolph-Macon Medical School&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308033004/http://markeroni.com/catalog/display.php?code=va_f_069 |date=2016-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its president [[William Andrew Smith (educator)|William A. Smith]] delivered a set of lectures advocating slavery in 1856 and 1857.&lt;ref&gt;http://docsouth.unc.edu/church/smith/bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The college has a historical relationship with [[Randolph College]] (formerly known as Randolph–Macon Woman's College) in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. The former women's college was founded under Randolph–Macon's original charter in 1893 by the then-president William Waugh Smith; it was intended as a female counterpart to the then all-male Randolph–Macon. The two schools later separated to become distinct institutions governed by two separate boards.  Randolph–Macon College became [[co-education]]al in 1971 with the enrollment of 50 women and the first full-time female faculty member.  (Randolph College became co-educational in 2007.)

In 1892, two [[University-preparatory school|preparatory schools]] — both called Randolph–Macon Academy — were founded. The only one that remains today is [[Randolph–Macon Academy]] in [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], [[Virginia]]. Randolph–Macon Academy is today the only co-educational military boarding school in the country affiliated with the [[United States Air Force]] [[Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (AFJROTC).

Randolph–Macon College became the first college south of the [[Mason–Dixon line]] to require physical education coursework for graduation. The old gym, built in 1887, was the first structure in the South to be constructed solely for instruction in physical education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=Virginia E.|title=Randolf-Macon College (Campus History)|date=2011|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|location=Charleston, S.C.|isbn=978-0738587141|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Randolph–Macon is considered to be the first college in the [[Southern United States|South]] to offer English as a full discipline and to develop biology as a distinct study.&lt;ref&gt;Scanlon, James. ''Randolph-Macon College: A Southern History, 1825-1967.'' University Press of Virginia, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its computer science department is one of the oldest in the country associated with a liberal arts school; in the 1960s when the program was established, many academics believed computer science to be more appropriate for a commercial trade or secretarial school than a traditional four-year institution.

Since 1923, the college has been home to the Zeta of Virginia chapter of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]], the nation's oldest academic honor society.  Chi Beta Phi, the national science honorary society, was founded at Randolph–Macon in 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rmc.edu/why-rmc/about/history/timeline04.aspx History of Randolph-Macon College] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805124018/http://www.rmc.edu/why-rmc/about/history/timeline04.aspx |date=2012-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic program ==
Randolph–Macon College offers a broad-based curriculum in the liberal arts and sciences.  The education emphasizes the development of critical thinking skills and effective oral and written communication.  All students must satisfy the general collegiate curriculum, which requires them to take courses in each of the Areas of Knowledge: [[civilization]]s, [[art]]s and [[literature]], [[social science]]s, [[natural science|natural]] and [[mathematics]], foreign languages, and [[health|wellness]].

Randolph–Macon offers two undergraduate degrees: the [[Bachelor of Arts]] and the [[Bachelor of Science]].  The college awards degrees in 38 majors: [[Accounting]], [[Archaeology]],  [[Art History]], [[Arts Management]], [[Asian studies]], [[Biology]], [[Chemistry]], [[Classical Studies]], [[Communication Studies]], [[Computer Science]], [[Drama]], [[Economics]], [[Economics/Business]], [[Engineering Physics]], [[English language|English]], [[Environmental Studies]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[History]], [[International studies]], [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Mathematics]], [[Music]], [[Nursing]], [[Philosophy]], [[Physics]], [[Political Science]], [[Pre-Engineering]], [[Pre-law]], [[Pre-med]], [[Pre-ministry]], [[Psychology]], [[Religious Studies]], [[Sociology]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Studio Art]], and [[Women's studies]].

The student-faculty ratio is 12:1.&lt;ref name="faculty"/&gt;

=== Calendar ===
Randolph–Macon operates on a 4-1-4 academic calendar. This allows for two four-month semesters (fall and spring) with a one-month term in January to split up the semesters. During the January Term (colloquially called "J-Term"), students are afforded the opportunity to take intensive study courses on the Randolph–Macon campus, travel the globe as part of a study-abroad course, or participate in professional internships in their field(s) of study and interest.

=== Four-Year Degree Guarantee ===
In 2011, Randolph–Macon announced a Four-Year Degree Guarantee program. The College guarantees that entering freshmen will graduate in four calendar years and, if qualifying students are not able to meet that requirement, then Randolph–Macon College will waive tuition costs for the courses that the student needs to complete their degree.

Randolph–Macon College has over 60 academic, administrative, athletic, and residential buildings on its campus of {{convert|116|acre|km2}} located in the heart of Ashland, Virginia.  The oldest building is Washington-Franklin Hall, built in 1872, soon after the college moved to Ashland from Boydton.  It was the first brick building in Ashland, and its construction was funded by the students.  Renovated in 1987, Washington-Franklin Hall now houses the history department.  Pace-Armistead Hall was built in 1876 (renovated 1997) and originally housed the chemistry department.  Today, it is home to the studio art department, including the Flippo Art Gallery.  The original Duncan Methodist Church was built in 1879 and was renovated to include classrooms and offices for the music and arts departments.  All three buildings are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and collectively they make up "Historic Campus."

Copley Science Center is the largest academic building on campus.  The biology, chemistry, physics/astrophysics, environmental studies, computer science, and mathematics departments are all located in Copley.  Copley Science Center was built as an extension of Smithey Hall, which today houses the psychology department.  Just north of Copley is [[Keeble Observatory]], which includes a 12" Cassegrain reflector optical telescope, and two [[radio telescope]]s.

Randolph–Macon has one main library: McGraw-Page Library.  Formerly, the library was located in Peele Hall, which is now the main administrative building on-campus and includes the Copy Center, Registrar's Office, Human Resources, provost, dean of students, and the president.

There are 12 residence halls on campus.  The seven halls on the north end of campus are collectively known as the Freshman Village.  About 75% of the college's freshmen live in one of those halls.  The four located near the center of campus house upperclassmen and the remaining freshmen.  These include the two oldest residence halls - Thomas Branch Hall and Mary Branch Hall.  The college also owns most of the fraternity and sorority houses, other houses devoted to special interest groups, and on-campus townhouses (usually reserved for seniors). Andrews Hall, named after former Dean of Students Rev. Ira Andrews, opened in fall 2011. The newest residence hall, Birdsong Hall, named for Constance and Thomas Birdsong '49, opened in fall 2014. Birdsong Hall provides state-of-the-art housing for upperclassmen, including common areas, study rooms, and laundry facilities.

The College announced a $100 million capital campaign in 2011.  A large portion of the funds will go toward enhancing facilities, including two new residence halls, new football and baseball fields and stadiums, additions and renovations to the McGraw-Page Library and Copley Science Center, along with the destruction of the Brown Campus Center that was rebuilt into the Brock Commons in 2013.

The main north-south railroad line for the east coast runs through the campus.  Most of the campus is located to the east of the railroad, but a handful of college offices, special interest houses, and athletic fields are located to the west of the tracks.  The Ashland train station (not part of the R-MC campus) is directly across from the southern entrance to the campus.

== Athletics ==
{{main article|Randolph–Macon Yellow Jackets}}

Randolph–Macon's [[college athletics|sports]] teams are known as the '''Yellow Jackets''' or, more simply, as "The Jackets." Randolph–Macon College plays in the Old Dominion Athletic Conference (ODAC), a member of Division III of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA).

Men's sports include baseball, basketball, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, and tennis. Women's sports include basketball, field hockey, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, and volleyball. Men's volleyball will be added in the 2019 season (2018–19 school year).

A '''rosette sampler''' is a device used for [[water]] [[Sample (material)|sampling]] in deep water (such as the [[Great Lakes]] or [[Ocean|oceans]]) in order to investigate about its [[water quality|quality]].

== Description ==
A rosette sampler is made of an assembly of 12 to 36 sampling bottles.&lt;ref name=whoi&gt;[https://www.whoi.edu/page.do?pid=8415&amp;tid=7342&amp;cid=11375 Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, "Rosette Sampler"]&lt;/ref&gt; Each bottle is a [[volume]] that range from a minimum value of 1.2 [[Litre|L]] to a maximum value of 30 L.&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; All of them constitutes the rosette sampler and are clustered around a cylinder situated in the center of the assembly,&lt;ref name=whoi/&gt; where there is a sensing system called Sea-Bird or [[CTD (instrument)|CTD]], that stands for "Conductivity, Temperature and Depth", although other variables can be measured by modern CTDs (e.g. water [[turbidity]], dissolved [[oxygen]] [[concentration]], [[chlorophyll]] concentration and [[pH]]).&lt;ref name=cee&gt;[http://www.cee.mtu.edu/great_lakes/images2/spotlight_rosette_CDT.html Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering Department at Michigan Tech, "CTD and the Rosette samples on Lake Superior"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The apparatus is attached to a wire rope. A winch on board of the boat unroll the rope during descent and roll up it during the ascent (i.e. at the end of the samples collection). During operations in the ocean, a rosette sampler can approach the seabed at a distance from 1 to 5 m, depending on the particular sea conditions.&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

The opening of each sampling bottle can be automatic (by reaching a certain depth) or manual (by operator, remotely).&lt;ref name=cee/&gt;

== Applications ==
Water sampling is used in general for [[chemical analysis]] and [[ecotoxicology|ecotoxicological]] assessment.&lt;ref name=jan&gt;[https://www.cefas.co.uk/premiam/publications/post-incident-monitoring-guidelines-subsea-oil-releases-and-dispersant-use/tg01-water-sampling/ Jan Brant, "Collection of water samples"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A rosette sampler is preferred to [[Winchester sampler]] for collection of water sampling at depths greater than 50 [[meter|m]].&lt;ref name=jan/&gt;

'''Social media mining''' is the process of obtaining [[big data]] from user-generated content on social media sites and [[mobile apps]] in order to extract patterns, form conclusions about users, and act upon the information, often for the purpose of advertising to users or conducting research. The term is an analogy to the resource extraction process of [[mining]] for rare minerals. Resource extraction mining requires mining companies to sift through vast quantities of raw ore to find the precious minerals; likewise, social media mining requires human data analysts and automated software programs to sift through massive amounts of raw social media data in order to discern patterns and trends relating to social media usage, online behaviours, sharing of content, connections between individuals, online buying behaviour, and more. These patterns and trends are of interest to companies, governments and not-for-profit organizations, as these organizations can use these patterns and trends to design their strategies or introduce new programs, new products, processes or services.

Social media mining uses a range of basic concepts from [[computer science]], [[data mining]], [[machine learning]] and [[statistics]]. Social media miners develop [[algorithm]]s suitable for investigating massive files of social media data. Social media mining is based on theories and methodologies from  [[social network analysis]], [[network science]], [[sociology]], [[ethnography]], optimization and mathematics. It encompasses the tools to formally represent, measure and model meaningful patterns from large-scale social media data.&lt;ref name="Zafarani"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zafarani |first1=Reza |last2=Abbasi |first2=Mohammad Ali |last3=Liu |first3=Huan |title=Social Media Mining: An Introduction |year=2014 |url=http://dmml.asu.edu/smm |accessdate = 15 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010s, major corporations, governments and not-for-profit organizations engaged in social media mining to obtain data about customers, clients and citizens.

==Background==

As defined by Kaplan and Haenlein,&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Kaplan |first1=Andreas M. |last2=Haenlein |first2=Michael|title=Users of the world, unite! The challenges and opportunities of social media |year=2010 |journal = Business Horizons | volume = 53 | issue = 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; social media is the "group of internet-based applications that build on the ideological and technological foundations of Web 2.0, and that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content." There are many categories of social media including, but not limited to, social networking (Facebook or LinkedIn), microblogging (Twitter), photo sharing (Flickr, Photobucket, or Picasa), news aggregation (Google reader, StumbleUpon, or Feedburner), video sharing (YouTube, MetaCafe), livecasting (Ustream or Twitch.tv), virtual worlds (Kaneva), social gaming (World of Warcraft), social search (Google, Bing, or Ask.com), and instant messaging (Google Talk, Skype, or Yahoo! messenger).

The first social media website was introduced by [[GeoCities]] in 1994. It enabled users to create their own homepages without having a sophisticated knowledge of [[HTML]] coding. The first social networking site, [[SixDegrees.com]], was introduced in 1997. Since then, many other social media sites have been introduced, each providing service to millions of people. These individuals form a virtual world in which individuals (social atoms), entities (content, sites, etc.) and interactions (between individuals, between entities, between individuals and entities) coexist. Social norms and human behavior govern this virtual world. By understanding these social norms and models of human behavior and combining them with the observations and measurements of this virtual world, one can systematically analyze and mine social media. Social media mining is the process of representing, analyzing, and extracting meaningful patterns from data in social media, resulting from social interactions. It is an interdisciplinary field encompassing techniques from computer science, data mining, machine learning, social network analysis, network science, sociology, ethnography, statistics, optimization, and mathematics. Social media mining faces grand challenges such as the big data paradox, obtaining sufficient samples, the noise removal fallacy, and evaluation dilemma.
Social media mining represents the virtual world of social media in a computable way, measures it, and designs models that can help us understand its interactions. In addition, social media mining provides necessary tools to mine this world for interesting patterns, analyze information diffusion, study influence and homophily, provide effective recommendations, and analyze novel social behavior in social media.

== Uses ==

Social media mining is used across several industries including business development, social science research, health services, and educational purposes.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"&gt;Zafarani, R., Ali Abbasi, M., Liu, H., (2014). Social Media Mining. Cambridge University Press. http://dmml.asu.edu/smm.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Singh, A., (2017). "Mining of Social Media data of University students." ''Education and Information Technologies'', 22: 1515-1526.&lt;/ref&gt; Once the data received goes through [[social media analytics]], it can then be applied to these various fields. Often, companies use the patterns of connectivity that pervade social networks, such as assortativity—the social similarity between users that are induced by influence, homophily, and reciprocity and transitivity.&lt;ref name="Tang, J. 2016"&gt;Tang, J., Chang, Y., Aggarwal, C., Liu, H., (2016). "A Survey of Signed Network Mining in Social Media". ''ACM Computing Surveys'', 49: 3.&lt;/ref&gt; These forces are then measured via statistical analysis of the nodes and connections between these nodes.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Social analytics also uses [[sentiment analysis]], because social media users often relay positive or negative sentiment in their posts.&lt;ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013"&gt;Adedoyin-Olowe, M., Gaber, M., &amp; Stahl, F., (2013). "A Survey of Data Mining Techniques for Social Media Analysis."&lt;/ref&gt; This provides important social information about users' emotions on specific topics.&lt;ref&gt;Laeeq, F., Nafis, T., &amp; Beg, M. (2017). "Sentimental Classification of Social Media using Dating Mining." ''International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science'', 8: 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

These three patterns have several uses beyond pure analysis. For example, influence can be used to determine the most influential user in a particular network.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Companies would be interested in this information in order to decide who they may hire for [[influencer marketing]]. These influencers are determined by recognition, activity generation, and novelty—three requirements that can be measured through the data mined from these sites.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; Analysts also value measures of homophily: the tendency of two similar individuals to become friends.&lt;ref name="Tang, J. 2016"/&gt; Users have begun to rely on information of other users' opinions in order to understand diverse subject matter.&lt;ref name="Adedoyin-Olowe, M. 2013"/&gt; These analyses can also help create recommendations for individuals in a tailored capacity.&lt;ref name="dmml.asu.edu"/&gt; By measuring influence and homophily, online and offline companies are able to suggest specific products for individuals consumers, and groups of consumers. Social media networks can use this information themselves to suggest to their users possible friends to add, pages to follow, and accounts to interact with.

'''Social science fiction''' is a [[subgenre]] of [[science fiction]], usually (but not necessarily) [[soft science fiction]], concerned less with [[technology in science fiction|technology]]/[[space opera]] and more with speculation about society. In other words, it "absorbs and discusses anthropology" and speculates about human behavior and interactions.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;"[http://archaeology.about.com/od/fictionstoriesandnovels/Archaeology_in_Fiction_Stories_and_Novels.htm Archaeology in Fiction, Stories, and Novels]". [[about.com]]. May 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration of fictional societies is a significant aspect of science fiction, allowing it to perform predictive (''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895); ''[[The Final Circle of Paradise]]'', 1965) and precautionary (''[[Brave New World]]'', 1932; ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', 1949; ''[[Childhood's End]]'',  ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', 1953) functions, to criticize the contemporary world (''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', 1726; the [[Alexander Gromov|works of Alexander Gromov]], 1995 - Present) and to present solutions (''[[Walden Two]]'', ''[[Freedom™]]''), to portray alternative societies (''[[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky#Noon Universe|World of the Noon]]'') and to examine the implications of ethical principles, as for example in the [[Sergei Lukyanenko bibliography|works]] of [[Sergei Lukyanenko]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== In English ==

'''Social fiction''' is a broad term to describe any work of [[speculative fiction]] that features social commentary (as opposed to, say, hypothetical technology) in the foreground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/applied-and-social-sciences-magazines/social-science-fiction|title=Social Science Fiction - Dictionary definition of Social Science Fiction - Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social science fiction is a subgenre thereof, where social commentary (cultural or political) takes place in a sci-fi universe. [[Utopian and dystopian fiction]] is a classic, polarized genre of social science fiction, although most works of science fiction can be interpreted as having social commentary of some kind or other as an important feature. It is not uncommon, therefore, for a sci-fi work to be labeled as social sci-fi as well as numerous other categories.

[[Thomas More]]'s book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516) represents an early example of the genre.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} Another early classic writer, [[Jonathan Swift]], penned critical views on current society—his most famous work, ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' (1726), is an example of a novel that is partially social science fiction (with such classic sci-fi elements as pioneering in strange new worlds and experimenting with variations of the human anatomy) and partially high fantasy (e.g., fantastical races that satirize various sectors of society).

One of the writers who used science fiction to explore the sociology of  near-future topics was [[H. G. Wells]], with his classic ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895) revealing the human race diverging into separate branches of [[Eloi]]s and [[Morlock]]s as a consequence of [[Social class|class inequality]]: a happy pastoral society of Elois preyed upon by the Morlocks but yet needing them to keep their world functioning—a thinly veiled criticism of capitalist society, where the exploiter class, or the bourgeoisie, is symbolized by the useless, frivolous Elois, and the exploited working class, or the proletariat, is represented by the subterranean-dwelling, malnourished Morlocks. Wells' ''[[The Sleeper Awakes]]'' (1899, 1910) predicted the spirit of the 20th century: technically advanced, undemocratic and bloody. Next to prognoses of the future of society if current social problems persisted, as well as depictions of alien societies that are exaggerated versions of ours (exemplified by ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' of 1897), Wells also heavily criticized the then-popular concept of vivisection, experimental "psychiatry" and research that was done for the purpose of restructuring the human mind and memory (clearly emphasized in ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', 1896).

Other early examples of influential novels include ''[[Vril|Vril, the Power of the Coming Race]]'' (1871) by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]],  ''[[Erewhon]]'' (1872) by [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], [[Looking Backward|''Looking Backward: 2000-1887'']] (1888) by [[Edward Bellamy]] and ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' (1890) by [[William Morris]]

In the U.S. the new trend of science fiction away from gadgets and space opera and toward speculation about the human condition{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} was championed in pulp magazines of the 1940s by authors such as [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and by [[Isaac Asimov]], who coined the term "social science fiction" to describe his own work.&lt;ref&gt;In his essay appearing in ''Modern Science Fiction: Its Meaning and Its Future'' (ed. [[Reginald Bretnor]], 1953).&lt;/ref&gt; The term is not often used today except in the context of referring specifically to the changes that took place in the 1940s,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} but the subgenre it defines is still a mainstay of science fiction.

Utopian fiction eventually gave birth to a negative and often more cynical genre, known as [[dystopia]]n: [[Aldous Huxley]]'s "negative utopia" ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) and, ''[[Animal Farm]]'' (1945) and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) by [[George Orwell]]. "The thought-destroying force" of [[McCarthyism]] influenced [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953). Examples of [[young adult fiction|young adult]] dystopian fiction include ''[[The Hunger Games (novel)|The Hunger Games]]'' (2008) by [[Suzanne Collins]], ''[[The House of the Scorpion]]'' (2002) by [[Nancy Farmer]], ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]'' (2011) by [[Veronica Roth]], ''[[The Maze Runner]]'' (2009) by [[James Dashner]], and ''[[Delirium (Lauren Oliver novel)|Delirium]]'' (2011) by [[Lauren Oliver]].

''[[The Chrysalids]]'' (1955) by [[John Wyndham]] explored the society of several telepathic children in a world hostile to such differences. [[Robert Sheckley]] studied polar civilizations of criminal and stability in his 1960 novel ''[[The Status Civilization]]''.

The modern era of social science fiction began with the 1960s,{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} when authors such as [[Harlan Ellison]], [[Brian Aldiss]], [[William Gibson]] and [[Frank Herbert]] wrote novels and stories that reflected real-world political developments and ecological issues, but also experimented in creating hypothetical societies of the future or of parallel populated planets. Ellison's main theme was the protest against increasing militarism. [[Kurt Vonnegut]] wrote ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]'' (1969), which used the science-fiction storytelling device of [[time travel in fiction|time-travel]] to explore anti-war, moral, and sociological themes. [[Frederik Pohl]]'s series ''[[Gateway (novel)|Gateway]]'' (1977–2004) combined social science fiction with [[hard science-fiction]]. Modern exponents of social science fiction in the [[John W. Campbell|Campbellian]]/[[Robert A. Heinlein|Heinlein]] tradition include [[L. Neil Smith]] who wrote both ''[[The Probability Broach]]'' (1981) and ''[[Pallas (Heinlein)|Pallas]]'', which dealt with [[Alternate future|alternative "sideways in time" futures]] and what a libertarian society would look like. He is considered{{by whom|date=March 2015}} the heir to [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s [[individualism]] and [[libertarianism]] in science fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Fitting, Peter. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20719029 "Utopias Beyond Our Ideals: The Dilemma of the Right-Wing Utopia."] Utopian Studies. Vol. 2, No. 1/2, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Today, the tradition is continued, although the term may be out of use. --&gt;[[Kim Stanley Robinson]] explored different models of the future in his ''[[Three Californias Trilogy]]'' (1984, 1988, 1990)&lt;!-- and carried out extensive studies of Mars colonization in ''[[Mars trilogy]]'' (1992, 1993, 1996) --&gt;.

''[[The Saga of Recluce]]'' (1991–present), by [[L. E. Modesitt, Jr.]] represents a fusion of science fiction and [[fantasy]] that can be described{{by whom|date=March 2015}} as social science fiction. The 13 books of the series describe the changing relationships between two technologically advanced cultures and the cultures of a primitive world to which each is involuntarily transported. Themes of gender stereotyping, sexism, ethics, economics, environmentalism and politics are explored in the course of the series, which examines the world through the eyes of all its protagonists.

[[Doris Lessing]] won the 2007 Nobel Prize for literature. Although mostly known for her mainstream works, she wrote numerous notable works of social science fiction, including ''[[Memoirs of a Survivor]]'' (1974), ''[[Briefing for a Descent into Hell]]'' (1971), the ''[[Canopus in Argos]]'' series (1974–1983), and ''[[The Cleft]]'' (2007).

The '''Sokal affair''', also called the '''Sokal hoax''',&lt;ref name="Derrida97"&gt;Derrida (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[scholarly publishing sting]] perpetrated by [[Alan Sokal]], a [[physics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[University College London]]. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to ''[[Social Text]]'', an academic journal of [[postmodern]] [[cultural studies]]. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's [[Rigour#Intellectual rigour|intellectual rigor]] and, specifically, to investigate whether "a leading North American journal of cultural studies&amp;nbsp;– whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as [[Fredric Jameson]] and [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]]&amp;nbsp;– [would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref name="experiments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html |title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies |last=Sokal |first=Alan D.|work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' |date= 5 June 1996 |accessdate= 2016-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article, "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative [[Hermeneutics]] of Quantum Gravity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sokal|first1=Alan D.|title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity|journal=Social Text|date=1996|volume=46–47|pages=217–252|doi=10.2307/466856|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the ''Social Text'' spring/summer 1996 "[[Science Wars]]" issue. It proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a social and linguistic construct. At that time, the journal did not practice academic [[peer review]] and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html| title = Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity| accessdate=April 3, 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| date=November 28, 1994| work = [[Social Text]] #46/47 (spring/summer 1996)| publisher = [[Duke University]] Press| pages = 217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MST"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]| url = http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html| title = Mystery science theater| author1 = Bruce Robbins| author2 = Andrew Ross|date=July 1996}}. Reply by Alan Sokal.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' that the article was a hoax.&lt;ref name="experiments"/&gt;

The hoax sparked a debate about the scholarly merit of commentary about the physical sciences by those in the humanities; the influence of [[postmodern philosophy]] on social disciplines in general; academic ethics, including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors and readers of ''Social Text''; and whether ''Social Text'' had exercised appropriate intellectual rigor.

==Background==
In an interview on the U.S. radio program ''[[All Things Considered]]'', Sokal said he was inspired to submit the bogus article after reading ''[[Higher Superstition]]'' (1994), in which authors [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt]] claim that some humanities journals would publish anything as long as it had "the proper leftist thought" and quoted (or was written by) well-known leftist thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first = Alan|last = Sokal|subjectlink = Alan Sokal|interviewer = [[Robert Siegel]]|title = Parody|work = [[All Things Considered]]|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]|date = 15 May 1996|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1043441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=mLgyyDSicEwC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=higher+superstition+proper+leftist+thought#v=onepage&amp;q=higher%20superstition%20proper%20leftist%20thought&amp;f=false|title = The Ivory Tower of Babel: Why the Social Sciences are Failing to Live Up to Their Promises|first = David|last = Demers|publisher = [[Algora Publishing]]|year = 2011|isbn = 9780875868806|chapter = Jesse Jackson vs. The Professors|pages = 15–40|quote = Sokal got the idea for his "experiment" after reading Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt's ''Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994).  Gross and Levitt argued that the success of getting published in postmodern journals was based not on the quality of the work but rather on its "academic leanings &amp;ndash; papers displaying the proper leftist thought, especially if written by or quoting well known authors, were being published in spite of their low quality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross and Levitt had been vocal defenders of the [[scientific realist]] camp of the "[[science wars]]", opposing postmodernist academics who questioned [[Objectivity (science)|scientific objectivity]]. They asserted that [[anti-intellectual]] sentiment in [[liberal arts]] departments (and especially in English departments) caused the rise of [[deconstruction]]ist thought, which eventually led to a deconstructionist critique of science.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} They saw the critique as a "repertoire of rationalizations" for avoiding the study of science.&lt;ref&gt;''Higher Supersitition'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Article==
Sokal reasoned that, if the presumption of editorial laziness was correct, the nonsensical content of his article would be irrelevant to whether the editors would publish it. What would matter would be [[ideology|ideologic]] obsequiousness, fawning references to deconstructionist writers, and sufficient quantities of the appropriate jargon.  Writing after the article was published and the hoax revealed, he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The results of my little experiment demonstrate, at the very least, that some fashionable sectors of the American academic Left have been getting intellectually lazy. The editors of Social Text liked my article because they liked its conclusion: that "the content and methodology of postmodern science provide powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project" [sec. 6]. They apparently felt no need to analyze the quality of the evidence, the cogency of the arguments, or even the relevance of the arguments to the purported conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. "Revelation: A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies". ''Sokal Hoax: The Sham That Shook the Academy.'' Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska, 2000. 49-54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Content of the article===
"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" proposed that [[quantum gravity]] has [[Progressivism|progressive]] political implications, and that the "[[morphogenetic field (Rupert Sheldrake)|morphogenetic field]]" could be a cutting-edge theory of quantum gravity (a morphogenetic field is a concept adapted by [[Rupert Sheldrake]] in a way that Sokal characterized in the affair's aftermath as "a bizarre [[New Age]] idea").&lt;ref name="experiments"/&gt; Sokal wrote that the concept of "an external world whose properties are independent of any individual human being" was "dogma imposed by the long post-Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook".

After referring skeptically to the "so-called scientific method", the article declared that "it is becoming increasingly apparent that physical 'reality{{'"}} is fundamentally "a social and linguistic construct".  It went on to state that because scientific research is "inherently theory-laden and self-referential", it "cannot assert a privileged epistemological status with respect to counterhegemonic narratives emanating from dissident or marginalized communities" and that therefore a "liberatory science" and an "emancipatory mathematics", spurning "the elite caste canon of 'high science{{'"}}, needed to be established for a "postmodern science [that] provide[s] powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project".

Moreover, the article's footnotes conflate academic terms with sociopolitical rhetoric, e.g.:

{{quote|Just as [[liberal feminist]]s are frequently content with a minimal agenda of legal and social equality for women and "[[pro-choice]]", so liberal (and even some [[socialist]]) mathematicians are often content to work within the hegemonic [[Zermelo–Fraenkel framework]] (which, reflecting its nineteenth-century liberal origins, already incorporates the axiom of equality) supplemented only by the [[axiom of choice]].}}

===Publication===
Sokal submitted the article to ''Social Text'', whose editors were collecting articles for the "[[Science Wars]]" issue. "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" was the only article submitted by a natural scientist. Later, after Sokal's self-exposure of his [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[hoax]] article in the journal ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', the ''Social Text'' editors said in a published essay that they had requested editorial changes that Sokal refused to make,&lt;ref name="MST" /&gt; and had had concerns about the quality of the writing, stating "We requested him (a)&amp;nbsp;to excise a good deal of the philosophical speculation and (b)&amp;nbsp;to excise most of his footnotes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html|title=Lingua Franca|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, despite subsequently designating the physicist as having been a "difficult, uncooperative author", and noting that such writers were "well known to journal editors", ''[[Social Text]]'' published the article in acknowledgment of the author's credentials in the May 1996 Spring/Summer "Science Wars" issue.&lt;ref name="MST" /&gt; The editors did not seek peer review of the article by physicists or otherwise; they later defended this decision on the basis that ''Social Text'' was a journal for open intellectual inquiry and the article was not offered as a contribution to the physics discipline.&lt;ref name="MST" /&gt;

==Responses==

===Follow-up between Sokal and the editors===
In the May 1996 issue of ''Lingua Franca'', in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", Sokal revealed that "Transgressing the Boundaries" was a hoax and concluded that ''Social Text'' "felt comfortable publishing an article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject" because of its ideological proclivities and editorial bias.&lt;ref name="experiments" /&gt; In their defense, the ''Social Text'' editors said they believed that "Transgressing the Boundaries" "was the earnest attempt of a professional scientist to seek some kind of affirmation from postmodern philosophy for developments in his field" and that "its status as parody does not alter, substantially, our interest in the piece, itself, as a symptomatic document".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ross, [http://www.math.tohoku.ac.jp/~kuroki/Sokal/sokaltxt/00005.txt "A discussion of Jacques Derrida and Deconstruction"], May 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Besides criticizing his writing style, the ''Social Text'' editors accused Sokal of behaving [[ethics|unethically]] in deceiving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bruce |last1=Robbins |first2=Andrew |last2=Ross |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/SocialText_reply_LF.pdf |format=PDF |title=Editorial response to Sokal hoax by editors of Social Text |year= 1996|publisher=Physics.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokal said the editors' response illustrated the problem he highlighted. ''Social Text'', as an academic journal, published the article not because it was faithful, true and accurate to its subject but because an "[[Argument from authority|academic authority]]" had written it and because of the appearance of the obscure writing. The editors said they considered it poorly written but published it because they felt Sokal was an academic seeking their intellectual affirmation. Sokal remarked:

{{quote|My goal isn't to defend science from the barbarian hordes of [[literary criticism|lit crit]] (we'll survive just fine, thank you), but to defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself. ... There are hundreds of important political and economic issues surrounding science and technology. Sociology of science, at its best, has done much to clarify these issues. But sloppy sociology, like sloppy science, is useless, or even counterproductive.&lt;ref name=MST/&gt;}}

''Social Text'''s response revealed that none of the editors had suspected Sokal's piece was a parody. Instead, they speculated Sokal's admission "represented a change of heart, or a folding of his intellectual resolve". Sokal found further humor in the idea that the article's absurdity was hard to spot:

{{quote|In the second paragraph I declare without the slightest evidence or argument, that "physical 'reality' (note the scare quotes) [...] is at bottom a social and linguistic construct."  Not our ''theories'' of physical reality, mind you, but the reality itself. Fair enough. Anyone who believes that the laws of physics are mere social conventions is invited to try transgressing those conventions from the windows of my apartment.  I live on the twenty-first floor.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, John, The Oxford Book of Parodies, Oxford University Press, 2010, pg. 307&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Book by Sokal and Bricmont===
{{main|Fashionable Nonsense}}
In 1997, Sokal and [[Jean Bricmont]] co-wrote ''Impostures intellectuelles'' (U.S.: ''[[Fashionable Nonsense|Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science]]'', U.K.: ''Intellectual Impostures'', 1998).&lt;ref name="EnglishPreface"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokal|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Sokal|author2=[[Jean Bricmont]]|title=Intellectual Impostures|publisher=Profile Books|year=1998|location=London|page=xii|isbn=1-86197-631-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The book featured analysis of extracts from established [[intellectual]]s' writings that Sokal and Bricmont claimed misused scientific terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies|accessdate=March 5, 2008|last=Sokal|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Sokal|work=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]|date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It closed with a critical summary of [[postmodernism]] and criticism of the [[strong programme]] of [[social constructionism]] in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Epstein97"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue22/epstei22.htm|title=Postmodernism and the Left|accessdate=March 5, 2008|last=Epstein|first=Barbara|authorlink=Barbara Epstein|work=[[New Politics (magazine)|New Politics]]&lt;!-- vol. 6, no. 2 (new series), whole no. 22 --&gt;|date=Winter 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512004646/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue22/epstei22.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage and Jacques Derrida===
As Sokal revealed the hoax, the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] was initially one of the targets of discredit in the United States, particularly in newspaper coverage.&lt;ref name="Derrida97"/&gt; A U.S. weekly magazine used two images of Derrida, a photo and a [[caricature]], to illustrate a "dossier" on the Sokal article.&lt;ref name="Derrida97"/&gt; Derrida responded to the hoax in "Sokal et Bricmont ne sont pas sérieux" ("Sokal and Bricmont Aren't Serious"), first published on 20 November 1997 in ''[[Le Monde]]''. He called Sokal's action sad (''triste'') for having overshadowed Sokal's mathematical work and ruining the chance to carefully sort out controversies about scientific objectivity. Derrida went on to fault him and coauthor Jean Bricmont for what he considered an act of intellectual bad faith in describing their follow-up book, ''Impostures intellectuelles'' (UK: ''Intellectual Impostures''; US: ''Fashionable Nonsense''): they had published two articles almost simultaneously, one in English in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 17 October 1997&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. "The Furor Over Impostures intellectuelles: What Is All the Fuss About?" ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' 17 October 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and one in French in ''[[Libération]]'' on 18–19 October 1997,&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. "Que se passe-t-il ?" ''[[Libération]]'' 18–19 October 1997. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; but while the two articles were almost identical, they differed in how they treated Derrida. The English-language article had a list of French intellectuals who were not included in Sokal and Bricmont's book: "Such well-known thinkers as Althusser, Barthes, and Foucault—who, as readers of the TLS will be well aware, have always had their supporters and detractors on both sides of the Channel—appear in our book only in a minor role, as cheerleaders for the texts we criticize." The French-language list, however, included Derrida: "Des penseurs célèbres tels qu'Althusser, Barthes, Derrida et Foucault sont essentiellement absents de notre livre." Derrida may also have been sensitive to a slight difference between the French and English versions of ''Impostures intellectuelles''. In the French, his citation from the original hoax article is said to be an "isolated" instance of abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. ''Impostures intellectuelles''. Paris: Odile Jacob, 1997. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the English text adds a parenthetical remark that Derrida's work contained "no systematic misuse (or indeed attention to) science."&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. ''Fashionable Nonsense''. New York: Picador USA, 1998. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Brian J. (2006). Hopkins Impromptu: Following Jacques Derrida Through Theory's Empire. ''MLN'', 121(4), pp. 919-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida cried foul, but Sokal and Bricmont insisted that the difference between the articles was "banal."&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. "Réponse à Jacques Derrida et Max Dorra." ''[[Le Monde]]'', 12 December 1997. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Derrida concluded, as the title of his article indicates, that Sokal was not serious in his approach, but had used the spectacle of a "quick practical joke" to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derrida |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |title=Paper Machine |origyear=1994 |year=2005 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |pages=70 |nopp=true |isbn=08-047-4619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social science criticism===
Sociologist Stephen Hilgartner, the [[Cornell University]] science and technology studies department chairman, wrote "The Sokal Affair in Context" (1997),&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein used a similar approach to Sokal's, submitting fictitious articles to real academic journals to measure their response. Though far more systematic than Sokal's work, it received scant media attention. Hilgartner argued that the intellectual impact of the successful Sokal hoax cannot be attributed to its quality as a "demonstration" but rather to journalistic hyperbole and the anti-intellectual biases of some American journalists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The Sokal Affair scandal extended from academia to the public press. The [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Bruno Latour]], criticized in ''Fashionable Nonsense'', described the scandal as a "[[tempest in a tea cup]]". Retired [[Northeastern University]] [[Mathematics|mathematician]] turned social scientist Gabriel Stolzenberg wrote essays meant to discredit the statements of Sokal and his allies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gabriel |last=Stolzenberg |url=http://math.bu.edu/people/nk/rr |title=Debunk: Expose as a Sham or False |publisher=Math.bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that they insufficiently grasped the philosophy they criticized, rendering their criticism meaningless. In ''Social Studies of Science'', Bricmont and Sokal responded to Stolzenberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/reply_to_stolzenberg_v2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Reply to Gabriel Stolzenberg|work=Social Studies of Science |publisher=Physics.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; denouncing his "tendentious misrepresentations" of their work and criticizing Stolzenberg's commentary about the "[[strong programme]]" of the sociology of science. In the same issue, Stolzenberg replied, arguing that their critique and allegations of misrepresentation were based on misreadings. He advised readers to slowly and skeptically examine the arguments proposed by each party, bearing in mind that "the obvious is sometimes the enemy of the true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stolzenberg|first1=Gabriel|title=Reply to Bricmont and Sokal|url=http://math.bu.edu/people/nk/rr/reply_to_bs.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological follow-up study==
In 2009, Cornell sociologist Robb Willer performed an experiment in which undergraduate students read Sokal's paper and were told either that it was written by another student or that it was by a famous academic. He found that students who believed the paper's author was a high-status intellectual rated it higher in quality and intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willer |first= Robb|last2= Kuwabara|first2= Ko|last3= Macy|first3= Michael|date= September 2009|title= The False Enforcement of Unpopular Norms|url=https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/4570/false%20enforcement.pdf|journal= American Journal of Sociology|volume= 115|issue= 2|pages= 451–90|access-date=21 February 2015|doi=10.1086/599250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spiritism and Spiritualism ===
At the beginning of the first chapter Hartmann explains that "the word '[[Spiritism]]' is of French production" but the English, and most part of the Germans prefer the term "Spiritualism." The author presents to use the term [[Spiritualism (beliefs)|"Spiritualism"]] to denote the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] point of view, which is the opposite of [[materialism]], and the explanation of [[Mediumship|mediumistic]] phenomena through participation of "[[spirit]]s", he offers to call by the term "Spiritism." {{sfn|Hartmann|2012|p=1}}{{refn|group=note|"Spiritualism is a religion based upon the belief that mediumship, the ability demonstrated by a few select persons to contact the world of spirits, proves that the individual survives bodily death. It arose in midnineteenth-century America and has spread around the world."{{sfn|Melton|2014|p=118}}}} He believes that most people, who are aspiring for Spiritism and read Spiritist journals, have no interest in a scientific study of the phenomena of mediumship, but instead seek "the confirmation of their belief in [[Afterlife|immortality]]."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=2|Treitel|2004|2p=14}}{{refn|group=note|History of "[[table-turning]]" in Germany began "in January 1853 when a woman in Bremen" received from New York a letter by her brother in which he, having reported on his successful spiritualistic experiments, suggested to her to conduct hers own experiments, in accordance with the detailed instructions attached to the letter. A few days later, in the salon belonging to the Bremen businessman, one of the first spiritualistic [[séance]]s in Europe was held.{{sfn|Treitel|2004|p=30}}}} Hartmann considers a reopening of the huge field of phenomena, that were rejected in the [[Age of Enlightenment]], as a great merit of the modern spiritistic movement. However, in his opinion, Spiritism threatens to become a public disaster in Germany, therefore the state should use its authority in order to interest scientists in a study of the spiritistic phenomena. He writes that the public has the complete right to know about these things, and since it is not able to formulate its own opinion, it only remains to wait for the conclusions drawn by the official representatives of science.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=14, 15, 20|Treitel|2004|2pp=14, 15|Doyle|2013|3p=183}}{{refn|group=note|[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] stated that, in accordance with the Hartmann philosophy, "the [[soul|ego]] survives death as a discarnate entity against a background of... Christian theology, and spiritualist speculations."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|1993|p=23}}}}{{refn|group=note|[[Frank Podmore]] wrote that the immature views of the first American Spiritualists were "transmuted and elaborated by European, and especially by German thinkers [including Hartmann]," who have leaded the phenomena into rank of scientific facts "by postulating new forces or new extensions of familiar forces, resident in the human organism, rather than to be content with adopting an explanation which is practically the negation of all explanations—the operations of spirits."{{sfn|Podmore|2011|p=162}}}}

=== Research methodology ===
Hartmann writes that in order to study the [[Paranormal|"abnormal phenomena of human nature"]] it is necessary to appeal to persons who are endowed with an abnormal organism. It should be remembered, he continues, that just as in "experiments with an electrical friction machine", there may be failures in experiments with mediums, but this should not prevent the "investigation of abnormal phenomena." He believes that the scientific study of spiritism should be based on "general methodological axioms" which can not be "transgressed with impunity."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1pp=4, 112|Карышев|1895|2p=27}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"First, principles are not to be multiplied without necessity; thus a second sort of causes are not to be supposed, as long as a single sort will suffice. Secondly, we should as long as possible abide by causes whose existence is guaranteed by experience or indubitable inference, and should not unnecessarily catch at causes of doubtful or unproven existence, such as are to be first established by their value as hypothesis for the explanation of phenomena in question. Thirdly, we should as long as possible try to do with natural causes and not touch supernatural ones without urgent necessity. Against these three axioms Spiritism offends."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1pp=112–3|Aksakow|1894a|2pp=333–4}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hypothesis of hallucinations ===
The study of "masked [[somnambulism]]," as Hartmann argues, can give an understanding of the "whole area" of mediumistic phenomena.{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=31}}{{refn|group=note|"'''Somnambulism''', a state of sleep, or half-waking trance, spontaneously or artificially induced in which subconscious faculties take the place of normal consciousness and direct the body in the performance of erratic (sleep walking) or highly intellectual actions (solving problems)."{{sfn|Fodor|1966a}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Massey, facts of somnambulism in respect to mediumistic phenomena "have certainly been too much neglected by Spiritualists."{{sfn|Massey|2012|p=xi}} Du Prel wrote that somnambulism is "the most convincing proof" of the existence of supersensible world, since it shows that subconsciously "we have intertwined" with this transcendental world. Somnambulism proves that "[[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] and Hartmann were right," when they asserted that the will and the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] compose basis for the phenomenon of man.{{sfnm|Du Prel|1889|1p=189|Du Prel|2012a|2p=166}}}} He explains that an "universal medium must be more than autosomnambule; he must be at the same time a powerful [[Animal magnetism|magnetiser]]." In his opinion, on a spiritistic [[séance]] medium plunges itself into a state of "masked or open somnambulism." Further, such a medium-autosomnambule has hallucinations, considered by him for reality, and at the same time, he possesses a strong desire that those present should see this imaginary reality, i.e. would have the same hallucinatory ideas as he himself.{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=32|Аксаков|1910|2pp=269–71}}

Hartmann believes that "from the scientific psychological standpoint" every participator of mediumistic séance must constantly think on himself that he is under the influence of a very powerful [[Animal magnetism|mesmerist]] who aims to immerse him in masked somnambulism and thus taint him with his hallucinations.{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=53|Аксаков|1910|2p=277}}{{refn|group=note|Hartmann explains mediumistic phenomena "psychologically in terms of hidden mental powers." He argues that medium is "a powerful mesmerist, capable of... creating a shared hallucination."{{sfn|Wolffram|2009|p=42}}}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The mediums in their state of masked or open somnambulism have a size of nerve force, be it self-produced or extracted and accumulated by those present, as no magnetiser in his waking state has made it unfold, so surely theirs ability must with the help of this superior quantity of force to put those present in a state of open or masked somnambulism, greater than that of any magnetiser acting in the awake state."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=55|Aksakow|1894a|2p=309}}{{refn|group=note|According to Hartmann, the existence of a "mediumistic nerve force", which, he writes, is "mistakenly" called a psychic one, is a fact.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=111|Аксаков|1910|2p=668}}}}{{hidden|Original text (in German)|Die Medien in ihrem larvirten oder offenen Somnambulismus über ein Maass von Nervenkraft, sei es selbstproducirter, sei es von den Anwesenden extrahirter und angesammelter, verfügen, wie noch kein Magnetiseur im ganz wachen Zustand es zur Entfaltung gebracht hat, so gewiss muss auch ihre Fähigkeit, mit Hilfe dieses überlegenen Kraftquantums die Anwesenden in einen Zustand von offenem oder larvirtem Somnambulismus zu versetzen, grösser sein als die irgend eines im wachen Zustand agirenden Magnetiseurs.|headerstyle=background:#DDDDDD}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Hartmann, the waking will of the medium in the somnambulic state fulfills the function of a magnetiser, giving the somnambulic consciousness a certain direction in relation to emerging hallucinations. If a medium "has the hallucination" of no longer being itself but of being the "spirit of [[Katie King (spirit)|Katie King]]," for example, and of appearing as such, the hallucination will also be transmitted to the recipients, that the medium who emerges from the curtain really is "Katie King."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=95|Аксаков|1910|2p=272}} He believes that materialisation is most often just a transfiguration of medium himself,{{refn|group=note|"'''Transfiguration''', metamorphic power of the medium to assume bodily characteristics of deceased people for their representation."{{sfn|Fodor|1966b}}}} because when the phantom was separating from the medium it always appeared that it was completely coming from the medium and returning to him.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=110|Аксаков|1910|2p=669}}{{refn|group=note|Hartmann tries to refer to "cases of hallucination-transference" that took place among "Indian fakirs and Turkish dervishes,"{{sfn|Hartmann|2012|p=89}} however, according to [[William Walker Atkinson|Ramacharaka]], although the images materialized "from the air" by fakirs are similar to those that are observed in spiritualistic séances, "there is really no connection between the two classes of phenomena."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=310}}}}

The hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann rejects the possibility of obtaining photographs on which both the medium and the materialised figure would be simultaneously placed, since hallucination can not be photographed, thus, in the opinion of its author, all such photographs are fake.{{sfn|Вагнер|1889|p=lii}} For example, about a photograph taken by [[William Crookes]], on which can seen the medium simultaneously with the phantom, Hartmann writes that it is exposed to the strong suspicion that "instead of the supposed phantom the medium, and instead of the supposed medium the dress of the medium, stuffed with a cushion in a half-concealed position, have been photographed."{{sfnm|Hartmann|2012|1p=93|Аксаков|1910|2p=238}}{{refn|group=note|[[Helena Blavatsky]] wrote: "Man can create. Given a certain intensity of will, and the shapes created by the mind become subjective. Hallucinations, they are called, although to their creator they are real as any visible object is to any one else. Given a more intense and intelligent concentration of this will, and the form becomes concrete, visible, objective."{{sfn|Blavatsky|1877|p=62}}}}

=== Hypothesis of nerve force ===
According to Hartmann, any physical phenomena of mediumship, regardless of their complexity, are always fulfilled due to "mediumistic nerve force,"{{sfn|Carrington|1907|p=367}}{{sfn|Melton|2001b}} which is nothing else than a physical force that is "produced" by medium's nervous system and passes unhindered through any substance, "like magnetism."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=50|Aksakow|1894a|2p=156}}{{refn|group=note|"Hartmann explained the physical phenomena as due to some force analogous to electricity or magnetism emanating from the medium's body."{{sfn|Podmore|2011|p=162}}}} The medium's will must direct this force and control the one, and the distribution of the one depends on the "fantastic image that is in the somnambulistic conscious of the medium." In addition, physical phenomena that require "a special strain of nerve force" are occurring when mediums sink into "an open somnambulism."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=31, 51|Aksakow|1894a|2pp=221, 317}} The author confirms that the imprints of organic forms belong to "the most striking phenomena" of mediumship—they had been surpassed only cases of "matter's penetration through matter." He admits that the imprints undoubtedly prove that in this case there is no transfer of hallucinations but "an objective-real impact of mediumistic force on matter,"{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=52|Аксаков|1910|2p=132}} and explains this phenomenon as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we imagine another arrangement of the pressure and tension lines of the mediumistic nerve force—an arrangement corresponding to those pressures that are produced by inner side of the flat laying hand on a soft substance capable of perceiving the imprint, then the movement of the particles of matter caused by such a dynamical system should again be consistented with that, which is caused by direct pressure of the hand, i.e. imprint of an organic form would have been obtained, although such a form, capable of producing such imprint, might not has been in material kind."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=50|Aksakow|1894a|2p=154}}{{refn|group=note|This passage of the philosopher was commented by Aksakov as follows, "This explanation contains a number of impossibilities from the point of view of physics."{{sfn|Aksakow|1894a|p=154}}}}{{hidden|Original text (in German)|Denkt man sich eine andre Anordung der Druck- und Zuglinien der mediumistischen Nervenkraft, entsprechend denjenigen Druckverhältnissen, welche die Innenseite einer flach ausgestreckten Hand auf einen eindrucksfähigen Stoff hervorbringt, so müsste die Verschiebung der Stofftheilchen, welche durch ein solches dynamisches System hervorgebracht würde, wiederum mit der durch den Druck der Hand hervorgebrachten übereinstimmen, d. h. den Abdruck einer organischen Form zeigen, ohne dass eine organische Form in materieller Gestalt vorhanden gewesen wäre, welche diesen Abdruck hervorgebracht hätte.|headerstyle=background:#DDDDDD}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the phenomena Hartmann explains by the fact that medium in a state of somnambulism allegedly combines "the hallucination of the emerging image" with the idea on the need to move a real object and unconsciously produces this [[Psychokinesis|displacement]] "with the help of his mediumistic nerve force," while remaining confident that it was performed by own force of the fantastic image that has appeared by him, that is, through the "transfer of his hallucination to the audience," he unconsciously inspires them with the idea that the displacement that occurred really was fulfilled by that ghost which is just his hallucination.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=102|Аксаков|1910|2p=127}}{{refn|group=note|Aksakov commented, "So, we have here a hallucination with additive of the nerve force."{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=127}}}}{{refn|group=note|Ramacharaka wrote that many of the so-called spiritistic phenomena are actually produced by "the unconscious [[astral projection]] of medium," and not by incorporeal beings, staying on other [[Plane (esotericism)|planes of existence]].{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=323}}}}

=== Mental manifestations ===
Regarding spiritistic messages, Hartmann argues that only "the somnambulistic consciousness" can be the source of their content. He writes, "All messages have a content corresponding to the mental level and views of the medium." As a rule, this level happens to be "below the spiritual level" of the medium and participants of the séance, less often it equals, but it happens to be never higher.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=116|Аксаков|1910|2pp=304, 349}}

The author writes that some mediums, with their "mimic transfigurations", exhibit striking linguistic abilities. They can reproduce words and phrases "in strange, incomprehensible dialects", which they had previously accidentally heard without paying attention to this.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=60|Аксаков|1910|2p=380}} According to Hartmann, only a medium, who can write, can "produce [[automatic writing]] or perform writing at a distance [without the involvement of the hand]."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=49|Аксаков|1910|2p=369}}{{refn|group=note|However, Aksakov discovered "in the annals of spiritualism" several cases of mediumship of babies, associated with automatic writing.{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=369}}}}

=== Explanation of paranormal ===
In principle, Hartmann admits the possibility of a mediumistic phenomenon of "the penetration of matter", as well as allows for the possibility of all other phenomena confirmed by the testimony of witnesses. However, he opposes the hypothesis by German astronomer [[Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner|Zöllner]] about the fourth dimension of space, preferring, rather,  the statement "on the molecular shakes of material bonds in the body, than the one on movements and vibrations outside of three-dimensional space."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=45|Aksakow|1894a|2p=116}}{{refn|group=note|Zöllner never admitted that spiritistic phenomena are produced by the spirits of dead people, but he connected them with the actions of some "mysterious beings" controlling the fourth dimension of space.{{sfn|Treitel|2004|p=14}}}} According to Hartmann, neither the sack nor the cage in which the medium can be contained will not be a hindrance to him: if he can pass through a substance in a state of sleep, "nothing prevents him from appearing as a phenomenon in front of the audience, in spite of all these precautions."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=88|Aksakow|1894a|2p=223}}{{refn|group=note|In Aksakow's opinion, "penetration" of one solid body by another can be imagined as the dematerialization of matter at the moment of passing through the object and then its reverse materialization.{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=101}}}}

After the mentioning to the "expansive action" of the mediumistic nerve force that overcomes the "cohesion of material particles" and leads to acoustic phenomena, Hartmann proceeds to spiritistic phenomena related to "penetration of matter", classifying them as "an especially incredible field of phenomena." He refers to the confirmed experiments of Zöllner and the facts of "a [[apport (paranormal)|transference]]" of objects into a locked room,{{sfn|Melton|2001}} which repeatedly observed under the most stringent conditions of control. He lists various types of "the penetration of matter": the passing an iron ring through the hand of a medium, penetration of coins, slate-pencils, etc. in completely closed boxes, the inserting a ring on the table's leg, the tying of knots on ropes and belts with "sealed" ends, the bringing into the séance's room the items from another room or other houses, as well as bringing of flowers which were growing outside the room.{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=44–5|Aksakow|1894a|2p=115}}

According to Hartmann, medium can't by only his will or by his purely psychological influence, cause the above-mentioned physical phenomena in inanimate objects. The main action of the will is a release the "mediumistic nerve force" out the nervous system and its directing with a certain way on the living or dead objects. Nevertheless, according to him, in the study of any phenomena of mediumism, with the exception of [[clairvoyance]], there is no need to go "beyond the bounds of the natural explanations."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=106|Aksakow|1894a|2pp=127, 224}}

=== On hypothesis of spirits ===
In conclusion, Hartmann assesses the central idea of spiritism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Thus the whole hypothesis of spirits has dissolved into pure nothingness, after first the direct physical power, then the production of the phenomena of materialisation, and finally production of the ideality of the manifestations, have shifted from the presupposed spirits to the mediums. Whether there are spirits or not, we do not have to examine here; in any case, if there are any, they are referred back to that other world from which Spiritualism believed them to have sunk into this world."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1p=117|Aksakow|1894b|2p=749}}{{sfn|Carroll|2003}}{{refn|group=note|According to Massey, the spiritualistic hypothesis about the activities of the spirits of dead people was greatly exaggerated, and most of the reports allegedly originating from them could be explained by other reasons that were not recognized. He wrote, "The current Spiritualist conception of death as a simple change of external conditions, so that there is a mere continuity of consciousness on the same level, and in the same modes, seems to me to denote great poverty of thought nor are we constrained to accept it on the evidence of facts."{{sfn|Massey|2012|p=xv}} However, according to [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]], after he made five hundred séances with a medium [[Leonora Piper]], "no other hypothesis except for the spiritualistic one can explain the phenomena that he observed."{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=677}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
One of the most active critics of Hartmann's book was [[Alexander Aksakov]].{{sfn|Melton|2001a}}{{refn|group=note|His "Answer for Hartmann" Aksakov began to print in parts in a German journal ''Psychische Studien'' immediately after the publication of this book. In 1890, it was published as a single edition entitled ''Animismus und Spiritismus.''{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=16}}}} The proofs which Aksakov used to "disprove Hartmann's hallucination hypothesis" were the photographs of spirits. The pictures "taken during the séances, in which both the medium and the materialised form were visible," were convincingly demonstrating, according to Aksakov, that materialisation is "an objective phenomenon", and not a kind the mass hypnosis (see the photo on the left). Criticism by Aksakov was supported in the publications of occultists in the journal [[:de:Sphinx (Zeitschrift)|''Sphinx'']], where "Hartmann was portrayed variously as obtuse or dishonest for his refusal to recognise his logical errors."{{sfn|Wolffram|2009|p=42}} Aksakov has been emphasizing that Hartmann had no practical experience and did not pay enough attention to those facts that did not correspond to his convictions, and many phenomena were "completely unknown" to him.{{sfn|Doyle|2013|p=184}}{{refn|group=note|Karl Du Prel highly praised Aksakov's book as having great significance for spreading Spiritism in Germany—it was in detail discussed in his article "Hartmann contra Aksakof" published in the ''Sphinx'' in June 1891.{{sfn|Kaiser|2009|p=69}} He wrote that Hartmann's work takes only 118 pages, whereas Aksakov's response is more than 800 pages (two volumes). This contrast, which is "remarkable in itself," is further strengthened when the reader learns that, according to Hartmann, he himself was never present at séances,{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=16}} whereas Aksakov who has become interested in the Spiritist movement in 1855, since 1870, repeatedly participated in the spiritistic séances.{{sfnm|Treitel|2004|1p=14|Aksakow|2012|2p=xxv|Du Prel|2012b|3p=26}}}}

[[File:Axakov materialization.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;A materialised figure and medium in trance. Photo by A. N. Aksakov.&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Sir William Crookes and Katie King.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;William Crookes, Katie King, and hers medium.&lt;/center&gt;]]
Professor [[:da:Alfred Lehmann|Alfred Lehmann]] wrote that Hartmann uses his hypotheses, according to how it is more convenient to him: if a materialised figure appears on séance, then for him it is just a hallucination imagined by the participators of the séance; if this phantom is displayed in the photo, then its appearance is explained by the action of the mediumistic nerve force, since otherwise it could not be photographed. But the view arbitrarily using such unstable explanations is "scientifically untenable."{{sfn|Lehmann|1908|pp=375–6}} Commenting on Hartmann's statement that imprints of the organic forms are produced by the mediumistic nerve force,{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|p=52}} Aksakov wrote that this hypothesis necessarily leads to "the acceptance of the length, thickness, and density" of this force, in other words, to that which usually serves to define the body, thus such imprints should be produced "by the action of an invisible body formed with help of the medium," that is, by the materialised form.{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=138}} Hartmann also speaks that mediumistic nerve force "can cause thermal and light phenomena," for example, it can produce certain forms, "at least inorganic ones: crosses, stars, a bright field with light points shimmering on it."{{sfn|Hartmann|1885|pp=49–50}} Hence, here, according to Aksakov's commentary, the nerve force becomes visible and does not constitute a hallucination. Why then does the same force that has become visible in a materialized organic image, sometimes in a luminous one, turns into a hallucination? According to Aksakov, the hallucinatory hypothesis by Hartmann is destroyed "by his own logic."{{sfn|Аксаков|1910|p=284}}

In connection with the hypothesis of the author, explaining the physical phenomena of mediumship, Massey noted that "the opinion of most persons conversant with them will be that Hartmann's hypothesis is too complicated in itself, and even thus is unadequate to the facts."{{sfn|Massey|2012|p=xiv}} [[Karl, Freiherr von Prel|Karl Du Prel]] brought such Hartmann's statement from the first chapter of his book: "Since I never attended a séance myself, I am not in a condition to form a judgment on the reality of the phenomena in question... On the other hand, I hold myself at any rate competent to offer a conditional judgment on the conclusions to be drawn from these phenomena in case of their reality, for this is peculiarly the office of the philosopher."{{sfnm|Hartmann|1885|1pp=16, 23|Du Prel|1891|2p=380}} Then he commented on this passage as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I must admit, I always believed that there is 'a golden rule for the philosopher'—to remain silent where he has no experience, so that no one could be told: 'Si tacuisses, philosophus mansisses!' (If you had been silent, you would have remained a philosopher!) That is why my final verdict lies in the fact that Hartmann, with his writings against spiritism, has certainly contributed to [[eristic]] but not in philosophy."{{sfn|Du Prel|1891|p=380}}{{refn|group=note|Nevertheless, according to professor Heather Wolffram, such researchers as Hartmann and Aksakov with their searches "of a new scientific psychology based on the phenomena of the unconscious" are no less important for modern science than the materialist physiologist [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and his colleagues.{{sfn|Wolffram|2012}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

The newspaper was founded by  Syed Azmathullah in 1927.&lt;ref name="ToI_Each"/&gt; It was inaugurated by Dr. [[Mukhtar Ahmed Ansari]], the president of the Madras session of the [[Indian National Congress]].&lt;ref name="Hindu_nurtures"&gt;{{cite news

 | author = Suganthy Krishnamachari
 | publisher = [[The Hindu]]
  | date = 2007-11-02
  | accessdate = 2008-04-30
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper's office has been located at the [[Triplicane]] High Road in Chennai.

After Syed Azmathullah's death, the newspaper was edited by Syed Fazullah, who died on 26 April 2008, at the age of 78.&lt;ref name="ToI_Each"/&gt; In 2007, Fazullah had expressed fear that the calligraphy might die with him, since his sons were not interested in carrying on the calligraphy tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/multimedia/2007/07/gallery_calligraphers?slide=7&amp;slideView=5 Image 7 of 22]. ''India's News Calligraphers Do It on Deadline''. [[Wired News|Wired]].&lt;/ref&gt; Fazullah's son, Syed Nasarulla, had stated that he has no interest in calligraphy, and "there will be changes", when he takes over.&lt;ref name="Wired_Future"/&gt;

As of 30 April 2008, the new editor had yet to be decided, but the newspaper is still published "hand-written" every day.

==The team==

The calligraphers, known as ''[[katib]]s'', work in a little corner of an 800&amp;nbsp;ft. one-room office. They don't have many facilities — only two wall [[electric fan|fans]], three [[electric bulb|bulbs]] and a [[tube light]].&lt;ref name="ToI_Each"/&gt; As of 2008, the calligraphy team consists of one man and two women, who work almost three hours on each page of the hand-written newspaper.&lt;ref name="ToI_Each"/&gt; The hand-written product is processed onto a photo negative and mass-produced with a [[printing press]].

As of 2007, Rahman Husseini is the chief katib (copywriter) of the paper. He joined the newspaper as an accountant, and took over as the katib, when the then chief katib died in 1980. In 2007, Rahman Husseni earned [[Indian rupee|Rs.]] 2,500 a month, while the other ''katib''s Shabana and Khurshid earned Rs. 60 a day per page.&lt;ref name="Hindu_nurtures"/&gt;

The chief reporter is Chinnaswamy Balasubramaniam, who has been with the newspaper for past 20 years.&lt;ref name="Hindu_nurtures"/&gt; The newspaper has correspondents all over India, including [[New Delhi]], [[Kolkata]], and [[Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh|Hyderabad]].&lt;ref name="ToI_Each"/&gt;

The newspaper's office often hosts renowned poets, religious leaders and royalty, some of whom contribute to the pages.&lt;ref name="Wired_Future"/&gt;

== Format ==

The newspaper consists of four pages. The front page is for national and international news, the second and the third pages are for local news, and the fourth page is for sports. Some space is left blank at the bottom right corner of the front page, in case there is some breaking news.&lt;ref name="ToI_Each"/&gt;

As of April 2008, the paper is sold for 75 [[paise]] a copy, and has around 22,000 subscribers.&lt;ref name="ToI_Each"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2013}}
''' ''The Province of Jurisprudence Determined'' ''' is a book written by [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], first published in 1832, in which he sets out his theory of law generally known as the 'command theory'. Austin believed that the science of general jurisprudence consisted in the clarification and arrangement of fundamental legal notions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Province of Jurisprudence Determined  |last= Austin  |first= John |authorlink= John Austin (legal philosopher) |editor = |year= 1832 |publisher= John Murray |location=London |edition= |volume= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= https://archive.org/stream/provincejurispr02austgoog#page/n5/mode/2up |accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His object in this book is to identify the distinguishing characteristics of positive law to free it from the precepts of religion and morality. The book consists of six lectures designed to be delivered in a law school setting. Although his theory did not receive significant attention in the 19th Century, it has since become central to the jurisprudential canon, and has been criticised, adapted and enlarged upon by subsequent jurists such as [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Ronald Dworkin]].

Austin was a student of [[Jeremy Bentham]], and as such subscribed to [[Utilitarianism]]. He adopted this perspective in his understanding of law, and argued that all laws should work toward promoting the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

According to Austin, a law is 'a rule laid down for the guidance of an intelligent being by an intelligent being having power over him.' This was what Austin defined as positive law. Austin believed that positive law was the appropriate focus of study for jurisprudence. He states that:

{{Quote|text='Every positive law, or every law simply and strictly so called, is set, directly or circuitously, by a sovereign person or body, to a member or members of the independent political society wherein that person or body is supreme.'}}

According to Austin, the sovereign could not be legally limited, 'supreme power limited by positive law is a flat contradiction in terms' he states. However, he did concede that a sovereign may be limited in a non-legal sense by 'popular opinion'.

He defined divine law as 'law set by God to his human creatures'. Although he contends that God's (law) is above and beyond human law, he also states that:

{{Quote|text='To say that human laws which conflict with the Divine law are not binding, that is to say, are not law, is to talk stark nonsense.' He emphasises that a law set by a sovereign to a subject is not negated by any apparent conflicting divine or moral law.'}}

'''Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr''' (TSKK) is a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] research-institute working on issues related to the [[Konkani language]], literature, culture and education. It is based in Alto [[Porvorim]], on the outskirts of the state capital of [[Goa]], India.

==Aim==

The TSKK says it "is devoted to the promotion of education and research in the Konknni language, literature and culture". It was registered under the Societies Registration Act in 1982 and first functioned from 1986 at the locality of [[Miramar, Panaji|Miramar]], before its current premises was built. It is located alongside the also Jesuit [[Xavier Centre of Historical Research]].

==Current status, and name==

TSKK is a Society registered under the Indian [[Societies Registration Act]] of  1860. From June 1999, it has been recognized by the [[Goa University]] as a  Konknni research institute.

This institution gets its name from the sixteenth-century English Jesuit priest, [[Thomas Stephens (missionary)|Thomas Stephens]] (1549–1619), a linguist and Marathi poet. Stephens came to Goa, then a Portuguese colony, on 24 October 1579. According to the institution, Stephens learned the Konknni and Marathi languages and wrote in them. He produced the first grammar to be produced in an Indian language, in Konknni  printed in 1622. Stephens died in Goa in 1619.

==Research bulletin==
[[File:India Goa TSKKBulletin.jpg|thumb|TSKK's Sod research bulletin]]

One of the activities of the TSKK is the publication of a research bulletin called ''Sod''. This journal is edited, produced and published as part of TSKK's "research efforts ... devoted to the promotion of education and research in (the) Konknni language, literature and culture". Its articles are a mix of Konknni written in Devanagari-script, [[Konkani in the Roman script|the Roman (Romi) script]], and occasionally in English too.

Issue No 10 April 2006 contains the following articles: 

* Konkani Myths: Pratap Naik SJ
* Social damage done by Goa's language controversy and (the) conspiracy behind it. Ramnath G Naik
* Roman script, the soul of Konknni. Nelson Lopes.
* Socio-economic growth of the Goan community through the Konkani language. Tomazinho Cardozo
* Roman script for Konkani, a must: now or never. Godfrey Gonsalves.
* Script controversy. Eduardo Faleiro.
* A response to "Konknni Myths". Alito Siqueira.
* Scripting controversy: debating the war of the Konknnis. Jason Keith Fernandes.
* An attempt to understand Konknni language assertion movement. Sammit Khandeparkar.
* Mother tongue blues. Madhavi Sardesai.
* Konkani versus scripts. Matthew Almeida, SJ
* The African, Portuguese, Kannada, Marathi, Malvani, Hindi and English influences on the hybridized Siddi-Konkani dialect. Geralda de Lima Angenot
* English medium primary education for better future. Cypriano Lopes.
* Response to "English medium primary education for better future" Joe F Vaz.

Generally ''Sod'' issues are priced at Rs 50 each (in Goa).

==Courses in Konkani, etc==

TSKK also offers courses in the [[Konknni]] language, and on project methodology for researchers, and study methodology for students. Currently (September 2006), the TSKK is working on language-teaching books for adults and children to learn Konkani (in the '''Romi''' or '''Roman''' script).

==Management and location==
[[File:India Goa TSKK PratapNaik.jpg|thumb|Pratap Naik, sj, director of TSKK]]
Earlier, this institute was headed by [[Fr Mathew Almeida, sj]] who has been succeeded by [[Fr Pratap Naik sj]].

Thomas Stephens Konknni Kendr is located at B.B.Borkar Road, Alto Porvorim, Goa (India) 403 521.

==Publications==

TSKK has come out with a number of publications in the [[Konknni]] language, or in languages like English introducing themes related to [[Konknni]], which is India's smallest language, spoken mainly along the west coast of this country.  

Some of its publication include a 1988 guide to writing [[Devanagari]] script [[Konknni]] (20 pp, then priced at Rs 3, now out of print), ''A Description of Konknni'' by [[Matthew Almeida, sj]] (1989), ''Teacher's and Parent's Manual'' (1996, pp 150)by Pratap Naik,S.J., ''TSKK Konknni Basic Course'' (Matthew Almeida, SJ, 1991), ''Tisvaddeacheo Igorzo'' ([[Moreno de Souza]], SJ, 1994, on the churches of the sub-district of [[Tiswadi]] in Goa), ''TSKK Romi Lipi'' (TSKK's orthography for Roman-script Konknni by Pratap Naik, SJ 2005 pp 52).

In addition it has also brought out five cassettes and CDs, of Konknni music containing devotional songs and nursery rhymes and children's songs.

==TSKK's plant collection==
[[File:India Goa TSKKgarden.jpg|thumb|TSKK's botanical garden]]

[[Jesuit]] priest [[Pratap Naik sj]], director of the TSKK currently, has been building a collection of over 328 trees and plants, all in the yard of a research institution studying the local [[Konknni]] language. Naik  argues that the culture of a place is reflected "not only" in its language, but also in its flora—apart from its fauna, architecture, food habits and dress.

He has been quoted saying that he wants to grow one of every fruit-bearing tree that grows in [[Goa]] which is rich in plant diversity. This richness is thanks in significant part to plant exchanges by the former rulers who centuries back controlled international seaways and had an empire straddling the continents.

Many months of hard work has seen Naik piece together a well-maintained and neatly labelled botanical garden. Visible are the local names in Konknni, the botanical names, their [[English language|English]] names. Elsewhere, he keeps a list of the original native countries of these [[Goa]]-adopted plants.

Among the collection are the '''ainno madd''' (the Fan Palm in [[English language|English]], or [[Livistona rotundifolia]] as it's known by its botanical name). It comes from tropical [[United States|America]].  There's the '''ambaddo''', dismissively perhaps called the [[Spondias|hog-plum]] that traces its origins to [[India]] itself. The '''ambor''' ([[mulberry]], or [[Morus alba]]) has [[China|Chinese]] origins. '''Kalljirem''' (black cumin, [[Nigella sativa]]) is again of [[India]]n origin. 

'''Kiraitem''' ([[canscora]] in English, or [[Canscora decussata]]) is from [[India]], but the '''zaifoll''' ([[nutmeg]], [[Mystica fragans]]) comes from the [[Moluccas]], the so-called [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] of past centuries, in the [[Far East]]. '''Gozgo''' (the [[fever nut]] or [[Caesalpinia bonduc]]) is, again, of [[India]]n origin.

Naik says he has already found the names of 325 species from among the 329 he planted. "Some don't have names in Konknni (the local language)," he is quoted as saying, obviously because of their exotic origins.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3121">'''Transformative arts''' is the use of artistic activities, such as [[Storytelling|story-telling]], [[painting]], and [[Musical composition|music-making]], to precipitate constructive individual and social change.

The individual changes effected through transformative arts are commonly [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Emotion|emotional]]. This results from the way participation in a [[Creativity|creative process]] and pursuit of an artistic practice can promote a critical re-evaluation of previously held [[Belief|beliefs]], accompanied by unfamiliar [[Feeling|feelings]], which alters [[Social perception|perception]] of the world, oneself, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Preminger, S., 2012. Transformative art: art as means for long-term neurocognitive change. Frontiers in human neuroscience, 6, p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social changes effected through transformative arts occurs when this altered perception manifests in new ways of interacting with others.&lt;ref&gt;Vail, J. and Hollands, R., 2013. Creative democracy and the arts: The participatory democracy of the Amber Collective. Cultural Sociology, 7(3), pp.352-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although engagement in artistic activities has been integral to the means by which individuals and communities have sought [[Comfort|personal comfort]], [[Self-reflection|self-reflection]], and [[Group cohesiveness|group cohesion]] for thousands of years, the origin of transformative arts as a modern formal concept is commonly attributed to the work of [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref&gt;Goldblatt, P., 2006. How John Dewey's theories underpin art and art education. Education and culture, pp.17-34.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey espoused four main ideas around which transformative arts pivot. Firstly, art is not an object but an experience, in which one or more persons participate. Secondly, every individual is potentially an artist by way of his or her capacity to participate in this experience, through any artistic activity. Thirdly, such participation inevitably precipitates some kind of transformative change to how the participants think, feel, and [[behave]]. Fourthly, art is therefore both psychological and social, transforming not only individual intrapersonal processes, but also interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;John, D., 1934. Art as experience. New York: Minton, Balch, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, transformative arts are facilitated by artists with the psychological purpose of promoting individual [[introspection]],&lt;ref&gt;Brooke, S.L. and Myers, C.E. eds., 2015. Therapists Creating a Cultural Tapestry: Using the Creative Therapies Across Cultures. Charles C Thomas Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the social purpose of promoting [[Social_exclusion#Social_inclusion|inclusion]], [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocity]], and [[social justice|justice]].&lt;ref&gt;LeBaron, M. and Sarra, J. eds., 2018. Changing Our Worlds: Arts as Transformative Practice (Vol. 12). AFRICAN SUN MeDIA.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4318">The skull and bones of a man buried between 9,800 and 10,200 years ago on [[San Miguel Island]], in California's [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]], were exposed by beach erosion and discovered and preserved in 2005 by [[University of Oregon]] archaeologists. The remains were dated by way of radiocarbon dating and evaluation of artifacts which had been intentionally buried with him. They were analyzed, but it was not possible to extract the Tuqan Man's DNA, though increasingly better testing techniques and methods became available and were utilized over the 12 years that passed after his original discovery. The remains were studied before their return to the island, which was delayed by resolution of tribal identification and ownership issues contingent on resolution of the precedent-setting [[Kennewick Man]] case from Washington State. Analysis of the bones indicated that he was in his forties when he died, and had spent time some distance east of what is now the Santa Barbara coastal region. Under procedures in accordance with the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), in May, 2018, they were restored to the claiming Chumash tribe, for reburial on the island. The [[Chumash people]] had long occupied the island before the arrival of the first European explorers, and the find was given the place name of the island in the [[Chumash language]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/special-reports/outdoors/2018/06/13/ancient-remains-discovered-reburied-san-miguel-island-tuqan-man-channel-islands-santa-ynez-chumash/670609002/ Tuqan Man, human remains buried 10,000 years ago, found on the Channel Islands], ''[[Ventura County Star]]'', Cheri Carlson, June 13, 2018. Retrieved June 15, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeological research has shown that San Miguel Island was first settled by humans at least 12,000 years ago, when San Miguel was still part of the larger Santarosae Island that connected the northern Channel Islands when sea levels were lower near the end of the Last Glacial period. Because the northern Channel Islands have not been connected to the adjacent mainland in recent geological history, the Paleo-Indians who first settled the island clearly had boats and other maritime technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Erlandson, J.M., T.C.

Willis 2011 Paleoindian seafaring, maritime technologies, and coastal foraging on California’s Channel Islands. Science 441:1181-1185.&lt;/ref&gt; San Miguel was occupied by the ancestors of today's [[Chumash people]] for many millennia. They had developed a complex and rich maritime culture based on ocean fishing, hunting, and gathering. They called the island Tuquan in the Chumash language. For many centuries, they built and used sophisticated canoes, called [[tomol]]s, made from sewn planks caulked with [[asphaltum]] (bitumen). In tomols, they fished and hunted in island waters and participated in active trade with their neighbors on the other islands and the mainland.

Among its distinguished [[List of UNITO law people|faculty and alumni]] are leading writers, philosophers and legal scholars.  Nowadays the Department of Law continues the tradition, with particular strengths in the fields of [[private law]], [[EU law]], [[comparative law]] and related fields.

==History of the Department==

The history of the Department of Law can be traced to the establishment of the [[University of Turin]], in 1404, and has followed its developments over the ensuing six centuries.

In autumn 1404, a [[papal bull|bull]] issued by [[Antipope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]], the Avignon Pope, marked the actual birth of a centre of higher learning in Torino, formally ratified in 1412 by the Emperor Sigmund's certification and subsequently, in 1413, by a bull issued by [[antipope John XXIII]], the Pisan Pope, and probably by another issued in 1419 by [[Martin V]], Pope of Rome, and by a series of papal privileges. The new institution, which initially only held courses in [[Civil law (area)|civil]] and [[canon law]], was authorized to confer both the academic "licentia" and "doctoratus" titles which were later to become a single "laurea" (degree) title. It was the Bishop, as Rector of Studies, who proclaimed and conferred the title on the new doctors.

In 1436, ducal licenses established the three core faculties of Theology, Arts and Medicine, as well as Civil and Canon law.  In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,  the legal studies increasingly grew, giving the Department a national and international reputation. Notable academics contributed to the growth of the Department. During the years of the [[Italian unification|Resurgence]], when a numerous group of patriots and intellectuals took refuge in the [[Savoy]] capital city, some of Italy's most remarkable names taught at the University and the Department of Law, like the jurist and statesman [[Pasquale Stanislao Mancini]], and the two economics professors [[Antonio Scialoja]] and [[Francesco Ferrara]].

In modern Italian history, the UNITO Department of Law was known for its central role in Italian national unification and cultural progressiveness.  For instance, in 1881, the  Department of Law graduated [[Lidia Poët]], who would become the controversial first female jurist in modern Italy.

In the first half of  20th century some outstanding names in the history of the Department and the university include: [[Luigi Einaudi]], in the field of the financial studies; [[Gaetano Mosca]] in public law; [[Francesco Ruffini]] in [[canon law]] and [[Paolo Greco]] in [[commercial law]]. 
Most recently should be mentioned at least [[Norberto Bobbio]], in legal philosophy; [[Giovanni Conso]], in criminal law; [[Gastone Cottino]] in commercial law; [[Marcello Gallo]], in criminal law; [[Giuseppe Grosso]] in [[Roman law]]; [[Rodolfo Sacco]] in civil and [[comparative law]].
The Department of Law is located in [[Turin]], nearby the fascinating [[Mole Antonelliana]].
It is one of the leading law departments in [[Europe]], with particular strengths in the fields of comparative law and private law. Additionally, the Department of Law has improved its physical facilities (including course offerings in [[Cuneo]] and international exchange programs with a number of the world's leading research universities).  
The Department of Law coordinates the research work of more than 120 law professors in the different areas of law.


==Academics and Degree Programs==
The Department offers a number of degrees, starting with the ''laurea di giurisprudenza'' (equivalent to an [[LL.B.]]), ''laurea specialistica'' or ''laurea magistrale'' (postgraduate law degree, equivalent to an [[LL.M.]]) and several specialized LL.M. programs.
The Department also offers some brief degree courses (three years).  In addition, the Department offers the ''dottorato di ricerca'' or the traditional research [[Ph.D.]] degree.  As a result of the [[Bologna Process]], all of the UNITO Law degrees are fully comparable and transferrable across Europe, and graduates of the law department in fact practice in a number of leading jurisdictions across Europe.

'''''Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in Australia. It was written by the Australian anthropologist Lynne Hume and first published in 1997 by [[Melbourne University Press]].

Hume first encountered the Pagan movement in Canada, before beginning to explore Pagan groups in her native Australia.

==Background==

===Academic fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practising Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.{{sfn|Orion|1995}}

===Hume and her research===
Lynne Hume had been born and raised into the Christian faith but maintained an interest in non-Christian beliefs and societies, becoming a [[religious pluralism|religious pluralist]] and leading her to study the discipline of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was introduced to the Pagan movement while in Canada during the early 1990s. Attending a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church in [[Calgary]], it was here that a group of Wiccans had been invited to give a talk on their magico-religious practices during a Sunday morning service. Intrigued, she joined two separate Wiccan covens; one, known as the Daughters of the Moon, was exclusively for women, while the other was a mixed gender group. She remained in these groups for a year before returning to Australia in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in her homeland, she began looking for Pagan groups here as well, encountering several Pagan individuals in Queensland before attending the second annual Pagan Summer Gathering (PSG), which was organised by the [[Church of All Worlds]] and held in the rural outskirts of [[Canberra]]. Although knowing nobody at the festival, she took part in the rituals which took place over the next five days, including a [[neoshamanism|neoshamanic]] meditation, an runic women's rite, a tree planting ceremony and a [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]]-inspired ritual devoted to the goddess [[Oya]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="In publishing this book, I hope that I can dispel some of the fear surrounding the topic and convey a more accurate picture of this little-known movement in Australia."|source=—Lynne Hume, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In preparation for ''Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia'', Hume spent five years among the Pagan community in both Canada and Australia, attending both private and public events including Sabbat festivals, workshops and conferences. She visited Wiccan covens in [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]] and Queensland, interviewing people both informally and formally. Immersing herself in the movement, she made many Pagan friends, noting that it became "not only a research project, but a highly enjoyable pastime." Alongside her active participation, Hume also made a study of most of the available literature on the subject, subscribing to Pagan newsletters and researching in the archives of the Canberra Occult Reference Centre, [[Murdoch University]] and at the [[Theosophical Society]] in [[Brisbane]]. She also sent out questionnaires through various Pagan newsletters and gatherings, attaining responses through a [[snowball sampling]] method.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Chapter one, entitled "Doing is Knowing: Introduction and Approach", begins with an introduction to the new religious movement of contemporary Paganism. This is followed by Hume's discussion of how she first encountered and came to study the Pagan movement, while the chapter is then rounded off with a discussion of the anthropological methodology that she adopted in her investigation.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=1&amp;ndash;15}} The second chapter offers a brief historical outline of the Pagan and Wiccan movements, and their arrival in Australia.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=16&amp;ndash;40}} The third looks at commonly held beliefs in the Pagan community, such as their moral values, their respect for nature, and their cosmological views,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=41&amp;ndash;78}} while the fourth examines the organisation and structure of the movement, looking at how individuals and embrace and convert to it, and how Wiccan covens operate.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=79&amp;ndash;111}}

Chapter five offers an examination of [[rites of passage]] and the process of ritual in Paganism and Wicca,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=112&amp;ndash;143}} while the sixth looks at Pagan belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=144&amp;ndash;168}} The following chapter discusses Pagan experiental and emotional experiences and beliefs regarding other realms,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=169&amp;ndash;204}} and the eighth looks at morality and ethics in the movement alongside its relation with legality.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=205&amp;ndash;225}} In her conclusion, Hume discusses the movement's attraction for those with feminist and environmentalist attitudes.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=226&amp;ndash;238}}

==Reviews==
Emma Tomalin of [[Lancaster University]] reviewed the work for ''[[Nova Religio|Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions]]''. Tomalin notes that Hume did not look specifically at the uniquely Australian features of contemporary Paganism, and tends toward being "descriptive rather than discursive", thereby appealing more to those "interested in an overview of contemporary Pagan belief and practice
than those who wish to explore its wider political or social implications."{{sfn|Tomalin|1999|pp=174&amp;ndash;175}}
