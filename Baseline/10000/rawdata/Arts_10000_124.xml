The '''AOL search data leak''' was the release, in August 2006, of detailed search logs by [[AOL]] of a large number of AOL users. The release was intentional and intended for research purposes; however, the public release meant that the entire [[Internet]] could see the results rather than a select number of academics. AOL [[Sanitization (classified information)|did not identify users in the report]], but [[personally identifiable information]] was present in many of the queries. This allowed some users to be identified by their search queries, prominently a woman named Thelma Arnold.

== Overview ==
On August 4, 2006, AOL Research, headed by Dr. Abdur Chowdhury, released a compressed text file on one of its websites containing twenty million search [[Index term|keyword]]s for over 650,000 users over a 3-month period intended for research purposes. AOL deleted the search data on their site by August 7, but not before it had been mirrored and distributed on the Internet.

AOL did not identify users in the report; however, [[personally identifiable information]] was present in many of the queries. As the queries were attributed by AOL to particular user numerically identified accounts, an individual could be identified and matched to their account and search history by such information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| publisher = [[TechCrunch]]
| date = August 6, 2006

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[The New York Times]]'' was able to locate an individual from the released and anonymized search records by cross referencing them with phonebook listings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

| last2=Zeller Jr
| accessdate=2018-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Consequently, the ethical implications of using this data for research are under debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

AOL acknowledged it was a mistake and removed the data; however, the removal was too late. The data was redistributed by others and can still be downloaded from mirror sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AOL apologizes for release of user search data|url=http://news.cnet.com/AOL-apologizes-for-release-of-user-search-data/2100-1030_3-6102793.html?tag=nefd.top|accessdate=August 12, 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=August 7, 2006|author=Dawn Kawamoto|author2=Elinor Mills}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AOL search data mirrors |url=http://gregsadetsky.com/aol-data/ |accessdate=August 12, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://swap.stanford.edu/20121002021427/http://gregsadetsky.com/aol%2Ddata/ |archivedate=October 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2007, Business 2.0 Magazine on CNNMoney ranked the release of the search data #57 in a segment called "101 Dumbest Moments in Business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/business2/101dumbest/2007/full_list/index.html | work=CNN | title=101 Dumbest Moments in Business: Full list}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits==
In September 2006, a class action lawsuit was filed against AOL in the [[U.S. District Court]] for the Northern District of California.

{{quote|The lawsuit accuses AOL of violating the Electronic Communications Privacy Act and of fraudulent and deceptive business practices, among other claims, and seeks at least $5,000 for every person whose search data was exposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AOL sued over Web search data release|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6119218-7.html|accessdate=August 12, 2013|newspaper=CNET|date=September 25, 2006|author=Elinor Mills}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Notable users==
Although the searchers were only identified by a numeric ID, some people's search results have become notable for various reasons.

===Thelma Arnold===
Through clues revealed in the search queries, ''[[The New York Times]]'' successfully uncovered the identities of several searchers. With her permission, they exposed user #4417749 as Thelma Arnold, a 62-year-old widow from [[Lilburn, Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Face Is Exposed for AOL Searcher No. 4417749|url=http://search-logs.com/user/4417749-thelma_arnold|accessdate=August 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This privacy breach was widely reported, and led to the resignation of AOL's CTO, Maureen Govern, on August 21, 2006. The media quoted an insider as saying that two employees had been fired: the researcher who released the data, and his immediate supervisor, who reported to Govern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===User 927===
One product of the AOL scandal was the proliferation of blog entries examining the exposed data. Certain users' search logs were identified as humorous, disturbing, or even dangerous.&lt;ref name="Frind"&gt;{{cite web

Consumer watchdog website ''[[Consumerist (blog)|The Consumerist]]'' posted a blog entry by editor Ben Popken identifying the anonymous user number 927&lt;ref&gt;[http://aolscandal.com/user/927-yoko_ono___anatai_dayo AOL user #927]&lt;/ref&gt; as having an especially bizarre and macabre search history.&lt;ref name="Popken1"&gt;{{cite web

  | title = AOL User 927 Illuminated
  | work = [[Consumerist (blog)|The Consumerist]]
  | format = blog
  | accessdate = December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The blog posting has since been viewed nearly 4,000 times and referenced on a number of other high-profile sites.&lt;ref name="consumerist-scariest"&gt;{{cite web

  | work = CNet News Blog
  | publisher = CNET
  | accessdate = January 28, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to sparking the interest of the Internet community, User 927 inspired a theatrical production, written by Katharine Clark Gray in Philadelphia. The play, also named ''User 927'', has since been cited on several of the same blogs that originally discovered the real user's existence.&lt;ref name="Popken2"&gt;{{cite web

  | format = blog
  | accessdate = December 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As time has passed, more artistic renderings of individual user logs have appeared. A series of movies on the web site Minimovies called "[[I love alaska|I Love Alaska]]" puts voice and imagery to User 711391 which the authors have labeled as "an episodic documentary".&lt;ref name="I Love Alaska"&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26568">'''''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55: Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy''''' is an [[ANSI|American National Standard]] published by [[ASHRAE]] that establishes the ranges of indoor environmental conditions to achieve acceptable [[thermal comfort]] for occupants of buildings. It was first published in 1966, and since 2004 has been updated every three to six years. The most recent version of the standard was published in 2017.

== Organization of standard ==
The body of the standard consists of a foreword (describing changes made in the current version), eight sections and two normative appendices:
# Purpose
# Scope
# Definitions
# General requirements
# Conditions that provide thermal comfort
# Design compliance
# Evaluation of comfort in existing buildings
# References
: Normative Appendix A: Methods for determining operative temperature
: Normative Appendix B: Computer program for calculation of [[Thermal comfort#PMV/PPD method|PMV/PPD]]

After the body of the standard there are 11 informative appendices. These are not part of the standard, but provide additional information about terms and methods described within the standard, as well as a bibliography, and a description of the addenda incorporated from the previous version in the current version.&lt;ref name="55_2013"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = ASHRAE Standard 55 | year = 2013 | title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Purpose ==
As described within the standard: "The purpose of the standard is to specify the combinations of indoor thermal environmental factors and personal factors that will produce thermal environmental conditions acceptable to a majority of the occupants within the space".&lt;ref name="55_2013" /&gt;

== Scope ==
The standard addresses the four primary environmental factors ([[temperature]], [[thermal radiation]], [[humidity]], and [[Thermal comfort#Air speed|air speed]]) and two personal factors ([[Thermal comfort#Metabolic rate|activity]] and [[Thermal comfort#Clothing insulation|clothing]]) that affect [[thermal comfort]].  It is applicable for healthy adults at atmospheric pressures in altitudes up to (or equivalent to) {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and for indoor spaces designed for occupancy of at least 15 minutes.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Definitions ==

=== Adaptive model ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#Adaptive comfort model}}
Adaptive model is a model that relates indoor design temperatures or acceptable temperature ranges to outdoor meteorological or climatological parameters.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Thermal comfort ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#thermal comfort}}
Thermal comfort is the condition of mind that expresses satisfaction with the thermal environment and is assessed by subjective evaluation.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Occupant-controlled naturally conditioned spaces ===
A occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space is where the thermal conditions of the space are primarily regulated by occupant-controlled openings.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Predicted mean vote (PMV) ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#PMV/PPD method}}
Predicted mean vote is an index that predicts the mean value of the thermal sensation votes (self-reported perceptions) of a large group of persons on a sensation scale expressed from -3 to +3 corresponding to the categories "cold," "cool," "slightly cool," "neutral," "slight warm," "warm," and "hot."&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Comfort zone ===
Comfort zone refers to the combinations of air temperature, mean radiant temperature (tr), and humidity that are predicted to be an acceptable thermal environment at particular values of air speed, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation (I&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Clothing insulation (I&lt;sub&gt;cl&lt;/sub&gt;) ===
{{Further |Thermal comfort #Clothing insulation}}
Clothing insulation is the resistance to sensible heat transfer provided by a clothing ensemble (expressed in units of clo, which is a unit to quantify the insulation provided by garments and clothing ensembles. 1 ''clo'' = 0.155&amp;nbsp;m²&amp;nbsp;°C/W (0.88&amp;nbsp;ft²·h·°F/Btu))&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Metabolic rate (met) ===
{{Further |Thermal comfort #Metabolic rate}}
Metabolic rate is the rate of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities of an individual, per unit of skin surface are (expressed in units of met) equal to 58.2 W/m² (18.4 Btu/h·ft²), which is the energy produced per unit skin surface area of an average person seated at rest.

=== Exceedance hours ===
Exceedance hour is the number of occupied hours within a defined time period in which the environmental conditions in an occupied space are outside the comfort zone.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Methods to evaluate thermal comfort ==

=== Graphic comfort zone method ===
The graphic method utilizes an overlay on a [[Psychrometrics#Psychrometric charts|psychrometric chart]] to indicate the [[operative temperature]]s and [[humidity]] at which [[thermal comfort]] is achieved in the winter (1.0 ''clo'') and summer (0.5 ''clo'').  It is based on the [[Thermal comfort#PMV.2FPPD method|Predicted Mean Vote]] (PMV) model.&lt;ref name = "Fanger1970"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fanger|first1=P.O.|title=Thermal Comfort|date=1970|publisher=Danish Technical Press|location=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt; The graphic comfort zone model is limited in applicability to conditions when the [[Thermal comfort#Metabolic rate|metabolic rate]] of occupants is 1.0-1.3 met and the [[Humidity#Absolute humidity|humidity ratio]] is below 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/kg dry air (0.012&amp;nbsp;lb H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/lb dry air).  If these requirements are met and the environmental conditions inside the building fall within the indicated ranges, then compliance is achieved.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Analytical comfort zone method ===
For humidity ratios above 0.012&amp;nbsp;kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/kg dry air (0.012&amp;nbsp;lb H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O/lb dry air), or for metabolic rates up to 2.0 met, the analytical model must be used to determine thermal comfort sensation.  Also based on the PMV model, this method uses tools such as the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool or the online [[Center for the Built Environment|CBE]] Thermal Comfort Tool&lt;ref name = "Hoytetal_2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/comforttool |title=CBE Thermal Comfort Tool |last1=Hoyt |first1=Tyler |last2=Schiavon |first2=Stefano |last3=Piccioli |first3=Alberto |last4=Moon |first4=Dustin |last5=Steinfeld |first5=Kyle |year=2013 |publisher=[[Center for the Built Environment]], [[University of California, Berkeley]] |accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to evaluate thermal comfort.  Users provide [[operative temperature]] (or air temperature and [[mean radiant temperature]]), air speed, humidity, metabolic rate, and clothing insulation value, and the tool evaluates predicted thermal sensation on a scale from -3 (cold) to +3 (hot). Compliance is achieved if the conditions provide thermal neutrality, measured as falling between -0.5 and +0.5 on the PMV scale.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Elevated air speed ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#Elevated air speed method}}
The section sets provisions for increasing the upper air temperature limit at elevated air speeds above {{convert|0.20|m/s|ft/min|abbr=on}}.  The methodology is based on the SET (Standard Effective Temperature) model, which provides a way to assign an effective temperature (at a standard metabolic rate, and clothing insulation values) to compare thermal sensations experienced at a range of thermal conditions.&lt;ref name = "NishiGagge_1977"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nishi|first1=Y|last2=Gagge|first2=A.P.|title=Effective temperature scale useful for hypo-and hyperbaric environments|journal=Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine|date=1977|volume=48|issue=2|pages=97–107}}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper limit of air speed is based on whether occupants have local control or not.  To evaluate compliance, the ASHRAE Thermal Comfort Tool may be used, or a computer model validated against the code provided in Informative Appendix G of the standard.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Local thermal discomfort ===
{{Further|Thermal comfort#Local thermal discomfort}}
 
Radiant temperature asymmetry between ceiling and floor, and air and walls must be limited to reduce discomfort.  To reduce draft risk at temperatures below {{convert|22.5|C|F}}, air speed due to the HVAC system must be {{convert|0.15|m/s|ft/min|abbr=on}} or below.  The vertical air temperature difference between ankle and head is limited to {{convert|3|C-change|F-change}} for seated occupants and {{convert|4|C-change|F-change}} for standing occupants.&lt;ref name=ashrae2013_a&gt;{{cite web|title=Addendum a to Standard 55-2013|url=https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/docLib/StdsAddenda/55_2013_a_Final.pdf|website=ASHRAE|accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; If occupants' feet will be in contact with the floor, the temperature must be {{convert|19|-|29|C}}.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Temperature variations with time ===
When occupants do not have control over the cyclical variation or drifts in indoor environmental conditions, the conditions within this section must be met.  Operative temperatures may not fluctuate more than {{convert|1.1|C-change|F-change}} within 15 minutes, nor change more than {{convert|2.2|C-change|F-change}} within 1 hour.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Acceptable thermal conditions in occupant-controlled naturally conditioned spaces ===
This method, also known as the [[Thermal comfort#Adaptive comfort model|adaptive comfort model]], is applicable in buildings without mechanical cooling (and no operating heating system) where occupants’ met rates are 1.0-1.3 met and their clothing levels are 0.5-1.0 ''clo''.  For this model the standard provides a graph of acceptable indoor temperature limits at prevailing mean outdoor temperatures (a mean of the daily mean outdoor temperatures of the previous 7–30 days).  An accompanying table lists provisions for higher operative temperatures at air speeds above {{convert|0.3|m/s|ft/min|abbr=on}} and up to {{convert|1.2|m/s|ft/min|abbr=on}}. The graph is valid for prevailing mean temperatures between {{convert|10|-|33.5|C}}.  It provides 80% and 90% acceptability ranges, indicating the percentage of occupants expected to be comfortable at the indicated indoor and prevailing mean outdoor temperatures.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Demonstrating design compliance ==
This section of the standard is applicable for the design of buildings.  All of the building systems must be designed to maintain the occupied spaces at the indoor conditions specified by one of the described evaluation methods at design conditions.  The systems must be able to maintain these conditions within the expected range of indoor and outdoor operating conditions.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

To demonstrate compliance the following must be documented, where applicable.  Sample documentation is provided in Informative Appendix J.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;
* Method of compliance (e.g. Graphic Comfort Zone Method)
* Design operative temperature and humidity, heating and cooling design outdoor conditions, total indoor loads, and design exceedance hours
* Assumed values for environmental factors (operative temperature, humidity, and average air speed) and personal factors (clothing insulation and metabolic rate) for heating and cooling design conditions; spaces where personal factors are outside the specified limits should be indicated as not within the standard’s scope
* A description of how local thermal discomfort will be addressed, including calculation methods, inputs and results
* System equipment capacities for each space demonstrating that thermal loads will be met under heating and cooling design conditions
* Where occupant-controlled elevated air speed is provided, a description of control type
* Air speed, radiant temperature asymmetry, vertical radiant temperature asymmetry, surface temperatures, and temperature variations in time must be calculated per engineering industry standards (e.g. Chapter 57 of the [[ASHRAE Handbook]]-HVAC Applications)

== Evaluation of comfort in existing buildings ==
Although the ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' does not require the evaluation of comfort in existing building, this part of the standard offers a guideline of performing an evaluation when one is required from other codes or standard. Generally, the evaluation of comfort in existing buildings can be performed from two perspectives: from occupant satisfaction survey and physical environmental measurements.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

=== Measurement methods ===

==== Occupant Survey ====
Indoor thermal comfort can be determined from the responses of the occupant survey. The survey shall be distributed to the entire occupancy or representative part of the occupancy. The standard suggests that if the surveys were distributed to more than 45 occupants, the response rate must exceed 35%. If that number is between 20 and 45, the minimum number of responses is 15. When the number is under 20, at least 16 must reply for the survey to make the survey representative.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

For satisfaction surveys, the thermal satisfaction scale shall end with choices: "very satisfied" and "very dissatisfied", and, also, the occupants should be allowed to explain their dissatisfaction by answering an open-ended question. As for point-in-time surveys, the survey should be solicited during the time of occupancy, and the satisfaction scale ought to be continuous. There should be at least seven points on the scale ending with "very acceptable" and "very unacceptable." The standard also specifies that when asking thermal sensation questions, the scale should be "cold, cool, slightly cool, neutral, slightly warm, warm, and hot." &lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

==== Physical measurements ====
For mechanically conditioned spaces, the PMV-based comfort zone has to be determined, which includes measuring and recording the metabolic activity and clothing insulation. The comfort zone boundaries must be adjusted to the air movements, and the zone conditions should be adjusted to avoid local thermal discomfort. For occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space, the adaptive model shall be used to determine the thermal comfort boundaries. For such spaces, the indoor and outdoor air temperature and mean radiant temperature and the air speed need to be measured.&lt;ref name="55_2013" /&gt;

''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' provides guideline on the position, time, and equipment accuracy of the physical measurement. The measurement locations should be where the occupants are expected to spend time in. If there are multiple such locations, the measurement can be performed at a representative location.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt; In cases that the optimal representative location cannot be found, the standard suggests specific locations in the space.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

For seating occupants, the air temperature and air speed measurements shall be taken at heights of 0.1, 0.6, and 1.1 m (4, 24, and 43 in.), and operative temperature and PMV shall be measured at 0.6 m (24 in.). The heights need to be adjusted for standing persons. Local discomfort caused by radiant temperature asymmetry shall be measured at occupants’ locations, with the sensors oriented to catch the maximum surface temperature differences.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

The standard suggests that the time of measurements should last two or more hours long, and it should also be a representative time of the year for this specific building. Measuring time step should be no more than five minutes for air temperature, mean radiant temperature, and humidity, and no more than three minutes for the air speed.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

In order to achieve acceptable results, the standard also suggests the minimum equipment accuracy based the current industry standard.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

When extracting environmental data from the Building Administration System, one should evaluate the location, height, and time step of the sensors based on the previous suggestion.&lt;ref name="55_2013" /&gt;

=== Evaluation methods ===

==== Occupant Survey ====
To evaluate the probability of satisfaction from satisfaction surveys, the standard suggests dividing the number of the votes falling between "just satisfied" and "very satisfied" by the total number of votes in that questions. The answers of open-ended questions from "very dissatisfied" occupants should be documented for later analysis.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt; For point-in-time surveys, the comfort evaluation shall be performed by dividing the number of votes between -1 and +3 by the total number of votes. One has to keep in mind that the results from point-in-time surveys are only effective during the time when the surveys were solicited.&lt;ref name="55_2013" /&gt;

==== Physical measurements ====
The measured results should be evaluated against the adjusted comfort zone for the specific building. There are two cases when evaluating thermal comfort: at a specific time or over a period of time. For a mechanically conditioned space at an instance in time, the PMV and SET model shall be used to establish the comfort zone, and the local thermal discomfort shall be evaluated against the limit posed this standard as well. For occupant-controlled naturally conditioned spaces, the measured results shall be check with the comfort zone established by adaptive model.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

To evaluate the thermal comfort over a period of time in a mechanically conditioned space, the exceedance hours are the sum of all the hours when the absolute value of PMV is greater than 0.5. For an occupant-controlled naturally conditioned space, the exceedance hours are the sum of hours when the operative temperature falls outside of the lower and upper boundaries of the comfort zone.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Appendix D: Use the metabolic rate data ==
Metabolic rate is the rate of transformation of chemical energy into heat and mechanical work by metabolic activities of an individual. It is defined as per unit of skin surface area which equals to 58.2 W/m² (18.4 Btu/h·ft²). This is the energy produced from a unit skin surface area of an average person seated at rest.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' provides a table of metabolic rate of different continuous activities. These values are valid for an average adult with surface skin area of 1.8 m² (19.6&amp;nbsp;ft²). The standard reminds the users that they should use their own judgment to match the activities being considered to the comparable activities in the table. Except sedentary activities, metabolic rate for all other activities is likely to have range of variation. This variation is depending on the individual performing the task and his/her environment.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

When the duration of an activity is equal or less than one hour, one can use a time-weighted metabolic rate. As metabolic rates increase over 1.0 met, the evaporation of the sweat becomes an increasingly important factor, and the PMV method does not fully account for this factor.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== Appendix E: Clothing insulation ==
Clothing insulation refers to the heat transfer of the entire body, which includes the uncovered parts, such as hands and heads. There is a variety of means to determine the insulation provided by clothing. Accurate data from the measurement using thermal manikins is acceptable. When such measurement is not feasible, this standard provides four methods to determine the clothing insulation. It is also specified that the methods provided by this standard are no longer valid when the clothing insulation exceed 1.5 ''clo''. And it is also not valid when occupants wear clothing that is highly impermeable to moisture transport.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;
The first method is the least accurate, according to ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'', and the accuracy increases in order of the methods.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

First, one can estimate the clothing insulation from the table provided in section five. If the clothing ensemble in question reasonably matches the clothing ensemble in the table, the indicated value can be used. The second method is to add or subtract individual garment clo value to achieve the clothing ensemble in question. Section five of the ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' provides a table with clothing insulation of a variety of individual garments. This table can be used together with the previous one, so that one can add or subtract the clothing ensemble from the ''clo'' value of each garment. The third method is to add all the ''clo'' value of each garment to match the clothing ensemble in question.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

The fourth method described in ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' can be used to determine the clothing insulation in mechanically conditioned spaces. This method is based on the concept that when occupants choose their clothing according to their environment, the outdoor environment is more influential than the indoor one. There is a figure in the section five of the standard which predicts the representative clothing insulation of the occupants as a function of the average outdoor [[thermal comfort#Air temperature|air temperature]] at 06:00 am. The function line has four segments: the average outdoor air temperature is below {{convert|-5.0|C|F}}, between {{convert|-5.0|C|F}} and {{convert|5.0|C|F}}, between {{convert|5.0|C|F}} and {{convert|26.0|C|F}}, and above {{convert|26.0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

There is a function to determine the representative clothing insulation at each segment. One can also take into account the posture of the occupants. So far, all the clothing insulation value can be used when the occupant is standing. When occupant is sitting, one has to realize the insulation effect of the chair, and the decrease of insulation due to compression of the air in the clothing.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

If the occupant is moving, it also affects the insulation value of clothing. In general, body motion decreases the clothing insulation by pumping air through clothing. ''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' recognizes that this effect varies largely depending on the nature of the movements and the nature clothing, such as how tight the clothing is. Thus, it only provides an approximation of the clothing insulation value of a moving person. This approximation is an equation that relates the clothing insulation with the metabolic rate. And this equation is only valid when the metabolic rate is between 1.2 and 2.0.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' also states that the thermal environment conditions desired for sleeping and resting vary largely among individuals and cannot be determined using the methods provided in this standard. Considering that a sleeping person or one in reclining posture will be provided with sufficient insulation with the bedding material, and he or she is also free to adjust, it is impossible to determine the clothing insulation effect for these occupants unless they are immobile.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' cautious the users that there are two forms of variability among occupants. In the first form, different individuals wear different clothing due to factors that are not related to thermal conditions, and the second form is opposite. For the first, it is not correct to use the average clothing insulation value to determine the desired thermal conditions for all occupants.&lt;ref name = "55_2013" /&gt;

== History of the standard ==
''ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 55'' was first published in 1966.  It was revised in 1974, 1981, 1992, 2004, 2010, 2013 and 2017.  Starting in 2004, it is now updated based on ASHRAE’s standard maintenance procedures. These periodic revisions are based on publicly reviewed addenda to the previous version available on ASHRAE’s website.&lt;ref name="55_2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = ASHRAE Standard 55 | year = 2004 | title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1992 the standard was updated with more extensive information on measurement protocols and an expanded definitions section.&lt;ref name="55_1992"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = ASHRAE Standard 55 | year = 1992 | title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2004 the standard underwent significant changes with the addition of two thermal comfort models: the [[Thermal comfort#PMV.2FPPD method|PMV/PPD]] model and the [[Thermal comfort#Adaptive comfort model|adaptive comfort model]].&lt;ref name="55_2004" /&gt;
 
In 2010 the standard included the following changes.  It re-introduced the Standard Effective Temperature (SET) as a method to calculate the cooling effect of air movement.  It also added a general satisfaction survey to section 7 intended to evaluate general thermal comfort in an occupied space, bringing the standard in line with current survey-based [[post-occupancy evaluation]] (POE) practices.&lt;ref name="55_2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | author = ASHRAE Standard 55 | year = 2010 | title = Thermal Environmental Conditions for Human Occupancy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2013 the body of the standard was rewritten in mandatory language, with informative language moved from the body of the standard to informative appendices.  The applicability of the cooling effect of air movement was expanded to apply to naturally conditioned spaces.  Section 7 underwent major revisions for measuring thermal comfort in existing spaces including procedures for physical measurements and survey methods, and how to evaluate and report results.  The last major change concerns measuring air speed and air temperature experienced by the occupant, which now must be an average across three heights and over a period of time.&lt;ref name="55_2013"/&gt;

'''Aesthetic Realism''' is a philosophy founded by poet and critic [[Eli Siegel]] (1902–1978) in 1941. It is based on three core principles. First, the deepest desire of every person is to like the world on an honest or accurate basis. Second, the greatest danger for a person is to have contempt for the world and what is in it—contempt defined as the false importance or glory from the lessening of things not oneself. Third, the study of what makes for beauty in art is a guide for a good life: "All beauty is a making one of opposites, and the making one of opposites is what we are going after in ourselves."

The philosophy is principally taught at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, a nonprofit educational foundation based in [[SoHo]], [[New York City]], through a variety of lectures, classes in poetry, anthropology, art, music, and individual consultations.

The Foundation faced controversy for its assertion that men changed from homosexuality through study of this philosophy. In 1990, it stopped presentations and consultations on this subject, explaining that it did not want to be involved in the atmosphere of anger surrounding the issue, and saying that "we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;ref&gt;Statement of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, 1990: "It is a fact that men and women have changed from homosexuality through study of Aesthetic Realism. Meanwhile, as is well known, there is now intense anger in America on the subject of homosexuality and how it is seen. Since this subject is by no means central to Aesthetic Realism, and since the Aesthetic Realism Foundation has not wanted to be involved in that atmosphere of anger, in 1990 the Foundation discontinued its public presentation of the fact that through Aesthetic Realism people have changed from homosexuality, and consultations to change from homosexuality are not being given. That is because we do not want this matter, which is certainly not fundamental to Aesthetic Realism, to be used to obscure what Aesthetic Realism truly is: education of the largest, most cultural kind."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Aesthetic Realism is based on the idea that reality, or the world, has a structure that is beautiful. Siegel identified beauty as the making one, or unity, of opposites.&lt;ref&gt;James H. Bready, "Eli Siegel's system lives" in the ''Baltimore Evening Sun'', 28 July 1982: "In brief, the Siegelian lifeview holds 'all reality, including the reality that is oneself [to be] the aesthetic oneness of opposites.' Motion and rest, surface and depth, love and anger, and so on, once identified, can and must be reconciled..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "In Aesthetic Realism, beauty is the putting together of things that can be thought of as opposites….Aesthetic Realism says that reality is aesthetics….Reality is, when completely seen, beautiful: that is, reality consists of a mingling in aesthetic relation, of such opposites as the orderly and disorderly…." ''Aesthetic Realism: Three Instances''&lt;/ref&gt;

In Siegel’s critical theory, "the resolution of conflict in self is like the making one of opposites in art." A successful novel, for example, composes opposites that people are trying to put together: oneness and manyness, intensity and calm, sameness and change.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub in ''Contemporary Authors'': "This philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that ‘what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life…, for poetry is a mingling of intensity and calm, emotion and logic.’" URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His studies led him to conclude that any successful work of art or music combines essential dualities.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Packard (author)|William Packard]]: "And as far as Aesthetic Realism goes, it is eminent good sense. Eli Siegel has boiled it down to a simple formula: ‘In reality, opposites are one; art shows this.’ An artist will try to see the opposites in action, in himself and in his world and eventually in his own work." "How a Major Poet Is Ostracized by Lit Cliches: Eli Siegel in View," published in ''newsArt The Smith,'' (1978) URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/NewsArt-Packard-article.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley: "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the Eli Siegel dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one. Art shows this.’" "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'', July 1964, (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism, Siegel developed this concept, writing that the arts and sciences all give evidence that reality has an aesthetic nature.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell in ''Art Students League News'': "According to Siegel all the arts and sciences are really attempts at liking and understanding the world." (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3)&lt;/ref&gt;  He described the world as having a construction like art: it, too, is composed of opposites. In Siegel's eyes, freedom at one with order could be seen in an electron, a tree, or the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Philosophers have often seen reality as freedom and order, simultaneously and continually. Indeed, the first opposites I chose in my ''Is Beauty the Making One of Opposites?'', 1955, were Freedom and Order. You can see these right now in the world if you look at it: freedom and order are in the street, in the ocean, in woods in upper New York State." "Good Sense for the World," ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #221 (22 June 1977); URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.net/tro/tro221.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "Verlaine...has some of the subtlest music in French verse. And here we have the first description of the world which beauty and art illustrate: that is, the world is simple and various at once. It is one universe, even as it has many twigs in twilight." "Good Sense for the World" (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel reasoned, "If...the structure of the world corresponds to the structure [of art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "If…the structure of the world corresponds to the structure music may have or a novel may have [or any art], that much the world may be beautiful in the deepest sense of the word; and therefore can be liked. "Good Sense for the World," (op. cit.).&lt;/ref&gt;

A primary concept of Aesthetic Realism is that the world can be liked honestly by seeing it as an aesthetic oneness of opposites. Further, a core teaching of Aesthetic Realism is that it is "every person's deepest desire to like the world on an honest or accurate basis."&lt;ref&gt;Martha Shepp: "Aesthetic Realism teaches that the deepest desire of every person is to like the world, honestly. This is the purpose of art education, and actually, ALL education." (Cataloguing Critiques: Submission to C. Staples &amp; H. Williams, the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN.)

However, Siegel recognized another competing desire which drives humans away from such an appreciation—the desire to have contempt for the world and what is in it, in order to make oneself feel more important.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Aesthetic Realism describe[s] the two opposed purposes in everyone’s life. As Siegel once observed, even though 'every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable,' there is also 'a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world.' According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity) and, on a larger scale, to the entire world when one nation’s contempt for another leads to war." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Siegel argued that when a person seeks self-esteem through contempt—"the addition to self through the lessening of something else"—he or she is unjust to people and things.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan Patterson: "Eli Siegel, the great American poet and historian, defined hatred and contempt of people different from ourselves as the false importance or glory people received from the lessening of people not like themselves." ''Herald Sun'' of Melbourne, Australia (19 April 2009); URL: http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/sunday-heraldsun/better-to-try-world-on-love/story-e6frf92o-1225700167216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contempt, the philosophy maintains, may seem like a triumph, but ultimately results in self-dislike and mental distress,&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "According to the philosopher, contempt for the world causes tremendous damage to the self (with effects ranging from boredom to insanity)." ''Contemporary Authors''; URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; and lessens the capacity of one's mind to perceive and feel in the fullest manner. Siegel held that, in the extreme, contempt causes insanity.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Campbell: "Among many bold pronouncements none by Siegel are stronger than the assertion that contempt of the world produces insanity." ''Art Students League News'' (March 1983, Volume 37, Number 3).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kernan]] in ''The Washington Post'' (16 August 1978): "There are two elements: oneself and everything that is not oneself, which he calls ‘the world.’ These two opposites must be brought into harmony: By liking the world, one can come to like oneself. If, on the other hand, one feels disdain, or what he calls contempt, for the world, unhappiness results. ‘Contempt can be defined as the lessening of what is different from oneself as a means of self-increase as one sees it,’ he says. Contempt can lead to insanity, according to Siegel." URL: http://www.aestheticrealism.org/Press-Articles-on-Aesthetic-Realism/Wash-Post-Article-Kernan.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetic Realism attests that one’s attitude to the world governs how all of life's components are seen: a friend, a spouse, a lover, a book, food, people of another skin tone.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel: "An attitude to the world…governs one in one's everyday life. If you feel that the world is ill-managed, is contemptible, is unkind, you have to show that in how you see Mildred or how you see Morton…" "Aesthetic Realism; or, Is a Person an Aesthetic Situation?" (14 January 1969); URL: http://www.annefielding.net/Aesthetic-Situation-by-Eli-Siegel.html.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "Siegel regarded this emphasis on the attitude of the individual towards the world as the major difference between Aesthetic Realism and other philosophies." ''Contemporary Authors'', URL: http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, Aesthetic Realism argues, individuals have an ethical obligation to give full value to things and people, not devalue them in order to make oneself seem more important.  Aesthetic Realism states that the conscious intention to be fair to the world and people is not only an ethical obligation, but the means of liking oneself.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff: "Nancy Starrels once attempted a working definition: Aesthetic Realism, she said, is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’" ''New York Post'' (16 June 1957)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub: "As Siegel once observed,…‘every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable.’" ''Contemporary Authors''; URL:http://pdfserve.galegroup.com/pdfserve/get_item/1/Sad7df8w16_1/SB976_01.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophy identifies contempt as the underlying cause of broader social problems as well: societal evils like racism and war arise from contempt for "human beings placed differently from ourselves" in terms of race, economic status, or nationality.  Siegel stated that for centuries ill will has been the predominant purpose in humanity’s economic activities.  The philosophy asserts that humanity cannot overcome its biggest problems until people cease to feel that "the world’s failure or the failure of a[nother] person enhances one’s own life." Siegel stated that until good will rather than contempt is at the center of economics and in the thoughts of people, "civilization has yet to begin."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Civilization Begins" in ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', #228 (10 August 1977).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major texts===
The philosophic basis of Aesthetic Realism was set forth systematically by Siegel in two major texts.  The first, ''Self and World: An Explanation of Aesthetic Realism, '' was written from 1941-3.  Individual chapters, including "Psychiatry, Economics, Aesthetics" and "The Aesthetic Method in Self-Conflict,"&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|978-0910492294}}&lt;/ref&gt; were printed in 1946. The full text was published in 1981 (NY: Definition Press).&lt;ref&gt;D.E., ''Booklist,'' (American Library Association, 15 January 1982): "A distinguished poet and teacher, Siegel died in 1978. This posthumous publication combines his essays and articles to give a final overview of his philosophy, called Aesthetic Realism....Siegel's passionate, affirmative intelligence is deeply stirring, frequently convincing. This is one of the few 'human improvement' doctrines to merit philosophic respect."&lt;/ref&gt; His second text, ''Definitions, and Comment: Being a Description of the World,'' completed in 1945, defines 134 terms used in the philosophic thought of Aesthetic Realism, including Existence, Change, Fixity, Freedom, Thought, Will, Wonder, Fear, Hope, Negation, Reality, and Relation. The work was published in 1978-9 as a series in the journal ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''

==Poetry==

Siegel stated that ideas central to the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism were implicitly present in "Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana,"&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Starrett in the ''Chicago Sunday Tribune'' (28 July 1957, part 4, p.4): "It is a longish poem, at once serious and jocose; an essay, according to Siegel, in Aesthetic Realism; and Aesthetic Realism, he says, is 'about [how] the having-to-do-withness or relation of people, is they, is themselves.'&lt;/ref&gt; the poem that brought him widespread fame when it was awarded ''The Nation'''s esteemed poetry prize in 1925. The philosophic principle that individuality ''is'' relation, "that the very self of a thing is its relations, its having-to-do-with other things," is in this poem.&lt;ref&gt;Corbett &amp; Boldt: ''Modern American Poetry,'' p. 144 (Macmillan Company, 1965): "Siegel’s poetry reveals a view of reality in which ‘the very self of a thing is its relation, its having-to-do-with other things.’"&lt;/ref&gt;  It begins with a hot, quiet afternoon in Montana and travels through time and space, showing that things usually thought of as separate and unrelated "have a great deal to do with each other."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors'': "Siegel composed ‘Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana’ with this principle in mind, taking 'many things that are thought of usually as being far apart and foreign and [showing] in a beautiful way, that they aren’t so separate and that they do have a great deal to do with each other.'"&lt;/ref&gt; These are lines near the end of the poem: &lt;br&gt;
::Hot afternoons are real; afternoons are; places, things, thoughts, feelings are; poetry is;
::The world is waiting to be known; Earth, what it has in it!  The past is in it;
::All words, feelings, movements, words, bodies, clothes, girls, trees, stones, things of beauty,
:::books, desires are in it; and all are to be known;
::Afternoons have to do with the whole world….

The search for that which connects all branches of knowledge &lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism on Art and Self," ''Peter Gorlin Interviews Eli Siegel on The World of Art, WKCR, 18 April 1963'' published in ''Definition 15'' (Definition Press, 1963): "Aesthetic Realism is an educational method. And the first thing that it asks is: What is there in common in biology, and in history, and in the study of music, and in psychology, and in religion, and in cookery, and in the study of the history of sport, and in the study of fabrics, and in the study of chemistry, and the study of geology, and in the study of the dance?  ''Is'' there something in common? The one thing that is in common is, obviously, the opposites, because in every art and every science, there is something that is and something that changes."&lt;/ref&gt; led Siegel to discover a key concept of Aesthetic Realism: "The world, art, and self explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites."&lt;ref&gt;''Music's Intellectual History,'' edited by Zravko Blažeković &amp; Barbara Dobbs Mackenzie (Répertoire International de Littérature Musicale, 2009), page 167: "It is a central belief of Aesthetic Realism that art, indeed, has metaphysical substance, and therefore any attempt to sever art and philosophy limits the precision and the freedom of one's mind. 'The world, art, and self,' said Eli Siegel, 'explain each other: each is the aesthetic oneness of opposites.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetic Realism classes were scholarly&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 24 September 1944: "These proceedings are orderly, sensible, and, in this writer’s opinion, scholarly and valuable."&lt;/ref&gt; and sought to demonstrate that poetry is related to the problems of everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;''The Villager,'' 26 July 1956: "This relation of poetry and aesthetics to what a person feels and thinks, goes through in any day of his life, is the unique contribution of Aesthetic Realism, the philosophy taught by Mr. Siegel."&lt;/ref&gt; The viewpoint of Aesthetic Realism is that "what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life."&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Straub, ''Contemporary Authors:'' "Known first as Aesthetic Analysis and later as Aesthetic Realism, this philosophy sprang from Siegel’s belief that 'what makes a good poem is like what can make a good life.'"&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicts the Freudian view of art as sublimation.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, ''Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Company, Inc., 1982): The basic tenet of Aesthetic Realism is that all reality is united in an aesthetic union of opposites: This is beauty itself....Siegel analyzes what he calls 'failures' as personified in the work of certain men, Sigmund Freud and T.S.Eliot among others. Siegel believes their common failure to be the neglect of seeing 'the large continuous purpose of man as good will for everything, animate an inaminate.' Freud 'appealed to incompleteness in man.' He confined man's possible view of self by emphasizing his sexual anxieties and death instinct as the keys to mental disorder."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel defined poetry as "the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual."&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel…[is the] founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism....Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.'"&lt;/ref&gt; In Aesthetic Realism classes he explained that the greatest desire of a person is to put together opposites, as, in a good poem, "emotion changes into logic: there is no rift between the two."&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Skene Catling, ''Baltimore Sun,'' 19 April 1952: "'In aesthetic realism,' Mr. Siegel said, 'emotion changes into logic: There is no rift between the two.' Emotion and logic, energy and calm, can and must coexist in poetry if it is to be good poetry, in Mr. Siegel’s opinion."&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that music distinguishes true poetry, whatever the language, period or style; the music of a poem shows the poet has honestly perceived opposites as one, and sincerely united personal feelings with the impersonal structure of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, Preface to ''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005): "Eli Siegel...founder of the philosophy Aesthetic Realism...[showed that] every true poem...has come from a person’s seeing something so justly that he or she has perceived in the immediate object the structure of the world itself: ''the oneness of opposites.'' And we ''hear'' that structure as poetic music. Poetry, he wrote, 'is the oneness of the permanent opposites in reality as seen by an individual.' That is true about every instance of good poetry--no matter what its style, or language, or in what century it was written. On the other hand, an unauthentic poem, however impressive, however praised, is insufficiently sincere...lacks that honesty which is a self at its very center meeting what an object really is."&lt;/ref&gt; "Poetry," he wrote, "arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' #181 (15 September 1976): "Poetry arises out of a like of the world so intense and wide that of itself, it is musical."&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Aesthetic Realism teaches, even a poem that in substance seems to condemn the world, in its technique and music is praising the world, seeing it truly.

In thousands of Aesthetic Realism lectures, Siegel demonstrated the centrality of poetry to every aspect of life, including "Poetry and Anger," "Poetry and Love," "Educational Method Is Poetic," "Poetry and Time," "Poetry, Money, and Good Will," "A Poetic Technique of Parenthood," "Poetry and History," and "Hamlet Revisited; or, The Family Should Be Poetry."&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/lectures/&lt;/ref&gt; His students affirm that an important aspect of the philosophy continues to be the study of how a good poem has within it "the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves."  This education, they assert, "makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;ref&gt;M. Carpenter, K. Van Outryve, Preface to ''The Critical Muse,'' p. iii (Terrain Gallery, 1973) {{ISBN|0-911492-18-6}}: "''The Critical Muse'' is an anthology permeated with the philosophy of Aesthetic Realism....Every poem on the pages that follow is about the need of a person to put together opposites in himself. What makes these poems so important is this: as they tell us about the opposites in ourselves, the ''way'' they tell us, the technique of poetry, shows that opposites can be one. The music of poetry...is the most important sign that opposites are one....In our studies with Eli Siegel, we have come to see poetry as having within it the composition, beauty, sanity we want in ourselves.  This is the education which makes it possible for poetry to be, as Matthew Arnold said, a ''criticism of life.''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== Lectures and classes by Eli Siegel ===
In 1946, Siegel began giving weekly lectures at [[Steinway Hall]] in New York City, in which he presented what he first called Aesthetic Analysis (later, Aesthetic Realism), "a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier."&lt;ref&gt;Donald Kirkley, "Poet Outlines a Philosophy," ''Baltimore Sun,'' 2 August 1946: "More than 160 persons…attended the introductory talk. Subsequent lectures will be given weekly at Steinway Hall. Tonight’s theme was 'Self and World.' In it, Mr. Siegel affirmed his belief that 'aesthetic analysis can be of help to everybody.' It is, he said, ‘a philosophic way of seeing conflict in self and making this conflict clear to a person so that a person becomes more integrated and happier.’"&lt;/ref&gt;
From 1948 through 1977, Siegel continued teaching in his library at 67 Jane Street in [[Greenwich Village]], where he also resided. Individuals studied Aesthetic Realism in classes such as the Ethical Study Conference, the Nevertheless Poetry Class, and classes in which Aesthetic Realism was discussed in relation to the arts and sciences, history, philosophy, national ethics, and world literature.&lt;ref&gt;"From Here to Obscurity" by Michael Kernan, ''The Washington Post,'' 16 August 1978: "[A]t 67 Jane St. in the Village…[Siegel] gave his first lessons….[T]oday there are perhaps 250 serious students, mostly New Yorkers, though a few commute from nearby cities."&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The arts ===
Among the earliest students of Aesthetic Realism were [[Chaim Koppelman]] (1920–2009),&lt;ref&gt;[http://chaimkoppelman.net/].&lt;/ref&gt; a painter, sculptor, printmaker,&lt;ref&gt;Trudie A. Grace, ''Same Objects/Different Visions: Etchings by Chaim and Dorothy Koppelman'' in ''Journal of the Print World'' (Winter, 2004) p. 36: "In the 1940s, Chaim Koppelman wanted to be a sculptor and then a painter, but in 1953 he switched to printmaking, attracted primarily by the potential for subtle chiaroscuro in the handling of form and atmospheric qualities as well as effects achieved in the biting of the plate."&lt;/ref&gt; and founder of the printmaking department of the [[School of Visual Arts]], and his wife, painter Dorothy Koppelman, who opened the [[Terrain Gallery]] in 1955, introducing Aesthetic Realism to the cultural scene of New York City with art exhibitions and public discussions of the Siegel Theory of Opposites in relation to painting, sculpture, photography, poetry, and later, music, theatre, and architecture."&lt;ref&gt;Bennett Schiff in the ''New York Post,'' Sunday, 16 June 1957: "An interesting aspect of the cultural life of this city within the past three years has been the development of the Terrain Gallery. There probably hasn’t been a gallery before this like the Terrain, which devotes itself to the integration of art with all of living, according to an esthetic principle which is part of an entire, encompassing philosophic theory. The gallery was organized and launched about three years ago by a group of young, cultivated persons including writers, artists and teachers, all of whom held a fundamental belief in common. This was the validity of the theory of ‘Aesthetic Realism’ as developed and taught by Eli Siegel, a poet and philosopher whose work has received growing recognition….Aesthetic Realism is: ‘The art of liking oneself through seeing the world, art, and oneself as the aesthetic oneness of opposites.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

Chaim Koppelman’s interviews of Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Anuszkiewicz, and Clayton Pond, in which these artists discussed the relevance of Aesthetic Realism and Eli Siegel’s Theory of Opposites to their work, are now part of the Smithsonian Archives of American Art.&lt;ref&gt;Smithsonian Archives of American Art: "Relevance of the Siegel theory of opposites to the work of Roy Lichtenstein, Clayton Pond, and Richard Anuszkiewicz, interview by Chaim Koppelman, 1968." [http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/collection/koppchai.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists began using Aesthetic Realism in writings about their fields, including [[Ralph Hattersley]], editor of the photography journal '' Infinity'',&lt;ref&gt;Ralph Hattersley, "Form and Content in Color," ''Popular Photography'' July 1964 (Vol. 55, No. 1, pp. 84-87): "The solution to our problem with opposites and the use we can make of photography in finding it is pointed to succinctly in the...dictum, ‘In reality opposites are one; art shows this.’ Siegel has, incidentally, a considerable influence on my thinking about photography; but to hold him directly responsible for any of my statements would be to make him considerably less of a philosopher and critic than he actually is."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nat Herz]], author of articles in '' Modern Photography'' and of the ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography.''&lt;ref&gt;Nat Herz, ''Konica Pocket Handbook: An Introduction to Better Photography,'' Universal Photo Books series (NY: Verlan Books, 1960).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Aesthetic Realism: We Have Been There'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), a book of essays by working artists in the fields of painting, printmaking, photography, acting, and poetry, documents how the Siegel Theory of Opposites "relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics".&lt;ref&gt;''Library Journal,'' 1 September 1969: "Heraclitus, Aristotle, Kant, Hegel, and even Martin Buber have posited contraries and polarities in their philosophies. Eli Siegel, however, seems to be the first to demonstrate that ‘all beauty is the making one of the permanent opposites in reality.’ Since the 1940s, this poet-philosopher-aesthetician has been advocating Aesthetic Realism: ‘that the structure of reality is aesthetic.’ He has also been demonstrating the practicality of and the necessity for the aesthetic criticism of self. The Siegel Theory of Opposites relates life to art and is basically a criterion for all branches of aesthetics."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artistic productions inspired by the philosophy were surrounded by controversy.  A theatrical production of [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen’s]] ''[[Hedda Gabler]]'' by The Opposites Company of the Theatre, in which the title character was presented as "essentially good", in keeping with Siegel’s interpretation of the play,&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "Did Hedda Gabler want humanity and the world to be more beautiful?  I see her as good because with all her uncertainty and displeasingness, this was the main thing in her life."&lt;/ref&gt; was highly praised in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;Ted Kalem, ''Time,'' 19 December 1969, p. 58: "Now, in an off-off-Broadway production by a group called the Opposites Company, there is a new Hedda Gabler, not only beautifully performed, but deeply and subtly thought through in terms that make it peculiarly relevant to the psychic and psychological states of the modern woman."&lt;/ref&gt; but severely criticized in ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kerr, "Hedda Is Not Candida," ''New York Times,'' 25 January 1970: "It is wholly boring and only boring….It doesn’t really mean anything to say that Hedda is 'essentially' good.  All people are 'essentially' good, or so I believe."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clive Barnes, "Hedda Gabler: the Good Person," ''New York Times,'' 18 January 1970: "To see Ibsen’s wonderful and dangerous Hedda…as 'a good person' is a cheap little travesty of drama, a misinterpretation of the playwright’s clear demands."&lt;/ref&gt; which also published Siegel’s response to the critics.&lt;ref&gt;Eli Siegel, "Two Critics of the New Hedda Gabler," ''New York Times, '' Sunday, 15 March 1970: "The history of criticism makes it clear that a lack of good will on the part of a critic constitutes an early form of critical incompetence….As Barnes and Kerr deal with various aspects of the Actor’s Playhouse production, if you have your ear to the ground you will discern not criticism but a displeasure with the existence of Aesthetic Realism as a thing to learn."&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company, composed of actors, singers and musicians, has appeared throughout the country in both musical performances and dramatic productions based on Siegel's lectures on [[Shakespeare]], [[Moliere]], [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], [[Ibsen]], [[Strindberg]], [[Eugene O’Neill]], [[George Kelly (playwright)|George Kelly]], [[Susan Glaspell]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aestheticrealismtheatreco.org/outreach.htm Aesthetic Realism Theatre Company]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism Foundation ===
The not-for-profit Aesthetic Realism Foundation was established by Siegel's students in 1973. Located at 141 Greene Street in [[SoHo]], New York, it is the primary location where the philosophy is taught, in public seminars and dramatic presentations, and in consultations for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Katinka Matson, p.34, ''The Psychology Today Omnibook of Personal Development'' (William Morrow &amp; Co., Inc., 1977): "The process of Aesthetic Realism takes the form of seminars...sponsored by the A[esthetic] R[ealism] Foundation. The seminars deal with a wide range of subjects: those that are directed toward daily problems and the greater problems of life.

Similarly, children want to feel excited and feel at ease at the same time."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Siegel appointed Ellen Reiss chairperson for the teaching of Aesthetic Realism. Since that time, she has conducted professional classes for the Foundation's faculty. Herself an Aesthetic Realism consultant since 1971, Reiss also taught in the English departments of [[Queens College|Queens]] and [[Hunter College]]s, [[City University of New York]]. She is a poet, editor, co-author (with Martha Baird) of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary'' (Definition Press, 1970), and instructor of the course "The Aesthetic Realism Explanation of Poetry".&lt;ref&gt;''Quintillions'' by Robert Clairmont (American Sunbeam Publisher, 2005) back cover: "Ellen Reiss is editor of the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known,'' where her commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly. She is Class Chairman of Aesthetic Realism, appointed by its founder, the philosopher, critic, and poet Eli Siegel; and is co-author, with Martha Baird, of ''The Williams-Siegel Documentary.'' She teaches at the Aesthetic Realism Foundation and taught previously in the English departments of Queens and Hunter Colleges, City University of New York."&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel died on November 8, 1978.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' obituary, 10 November 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;  His work is continued by Reiss, whose editorial commentaries on literature, life, and national ethics appear regularly in the periodical ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known.''&lt;ref&gt;http://aestheticrealism.net/tro&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aesthetic Realism and homosexuality===

A controversial aspect of the philosophy concerns the assertion that men and women could change from homosexuality through studying its principles. In 1946 writer and WW II veteran Sheldon Kranz (1919–1980) was the first man to report that he changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight," ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "The late Sheldon Kranz, a GI in World War II, was the first man to make the change in 1946. Kranz later married Anne Fielding and the couple remained married for 24 years until his death recently."&lt;/ref&gt;   Kranz said that as his way of seeing the world changed, his sexual preference also changed: from a homosexual orientation (he was no longer impelled toward men) to a heterosexual one that included love for a woman for the first time in his life. Kranz was married for 25 years (until his death) to [[Obie]] award-winning actress Anne Fielding.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black; ''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971). "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual." Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black: "One of the things that happened in terms of my wife is that every time I had sex I have never had that ghastly feeling afterwards. As a matter of fact, it never ceases to be a source of wonder to me that one could have sex and really feel good afterwards."&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with its general approach, Aesthetic Realism views homosexuality as a philosophic matter.&lt;ref&gt;"The Homosexual Story" by Eli Siegel, ''The Right of Aesthetic Realism to Be Known'', Issue #316, April 25, 1979. "Aesthetic Realism was not chiefly interested, as I said, in talking to homosexual people, although it felt it could be of great use. [T]he principal purpose of Aesthetic Realism in talking to a homosexual person [was] to have him see the world differently and therefore himself differently; or, if one wishes, to have him see himself differently and therefore the world differently."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'' show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor,(New York: Definition Press, 1971), "Aesthetic Realism is the first body of knowledge which presents a way of seeing the world that incidentally affects one in terms of the way one sees women…so that one can be permanently heterosexual."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Elmhurst Press'' (Elmhurst, Illinois), "Aesthetic Realism Ends Homosexuality," August 17, 1983, "Five formerly homosexual men…appeared with David [Susskind] and told how they had changed from homosexuality to heterosexuality with the help of a program of Aesthetic Realism developed by Eli Siegel…It is not just for homosexuals but everyone who may feel he or she would like to make some changes."&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental principle of the philosophy is that every person is in a fight between contempt for the world and respect for it.&lt;ref&gt;"Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality" by Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The cornerstone of Aesthetic Realism is four-fold: ‘Every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself. Every person, in order to respect himself, has to see the world as beautiful, or good, or acceptable. There is a disposition in every person to think he will be for himself by making less of the outside world."&lt;/ref&gt;   Siegel stated that this fight is present as well in homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah A. Staub in ''Contemporary Authors.'' "The first statement of Aesthetic Realism maintains that ‘every person is always trying to put together opposites in himself.’ Though Siegel never intended this principle to become identified with any particular form of self-conflict, it long ago became linked to his position on what he termed the ‘H Persuasion’--homosexuality. Because he believed homosexuality arises from contempt for the world that manifests itself as contempt for women, the philosopher reasoned that people could be 'changed from homosexuality' if they were taught to 'like the world on an honest basis.' Since 1946, over 100 men and women say they have 'changed from homosexuality' after attending special question-and-answer consultation sessions conducted by teachers of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; He explained: "All homosexuality arises from contempt of the world, not liking it sufficiently. This changes into a contempt for women."&lt;ref&gt;"Instances of How Aesthetic Realism Sees A Matter of This Time" by Eli Siegel from ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the philosophy, in the field of love and sex, a homosexual man prefers the sameness of another man while undervaluing the difference of the world that a woman represents. This undervaluing of difference is a form of contempt for the world; therefore, as a man learns how to like the world honestly, his attitude towards difference changes and this affects every area of his life, including sexual preference.&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Kranz to interviewer Jonathan Black, ''Free Time'', show, WNET, New York: 19 February 1971. Interview reprinted in ''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971): "It’s a very philosophic matter, but maybe I can explain it as simply as possible. I think that the desire of every person, just as person, is to be able to welcome and take to himself as much of the variety and diversity and difference of the world as possible….A person becomes educated…to get more and more of the diversity of the world to him. I feel that in homosexuality there is such a limiting of that…such a denying of difference, that I feel there is something very deep in the self of a person that says, ‘This is not what I want.’ Now, as I said…if people…really can say, ‘I like myself this way, really,’ –it’s not for me to say one way or the other."&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1965 supporters of the philosophy began an effort to have press and media report on the change from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971), p. xvii. "Since 1965 there has been a more or less continuous effort to have some coverage of the documented changes from homosexuality through the study of Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1971 men (including Kranz) who said they changed through Aesthetic Realism were interviewed on New York City’s WNET Channel 13 ''Free Time'' show&lt;ref&gt;''Free Time'' show, WNET, Channel 13, New York, aired 19 February 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''David Susskind Show'',&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 4 April 1971, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; which had a national syndication.  The book ''The H Persuasion'',&lt;ref&gt;''The H Persuasion'', Sheldon Kranz, editor (New York: Definition Press, 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; published that year, contained writing by Siegel detailing his premise about the cause of homosexuality, transcripts of Aesthetic Realism lessons, and narratives by men who said they changed, describing both why they changed and how.  In response to requests from men and women wanting to study Aesthetic Realism, Siegel designated four consultation trios, one of which, Consultation With Three, was for the purpose of teaching men who wanted to change from homosexuality.  In 1983, five other men who said they had changed from homosexuality were interviewed on the ''David Susskind Show.''&lt;ref&gt;''The David Susskind Show'' WNEW-TV, Channel 5, aired 8 May 1983, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; The transcript of this interview was published in the 1986 book ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality.''&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Reiss, editor, ''The Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel and the Change from Homosexuality'' (New York: Definition Press, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of a brief 1971 review calling ''The H Persuasion'' "less a book than a collection of pietistic snippets by Believers,"&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', Book Review, page BR64, September 12, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  the ''New York Times'' never reported that men said they changed from homosexuality through Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Green: "FYI Put those fears away, all citizens-to-be" ''The Globe and Mail'', April 28, 1978, p.8 "Pity the lot of the Aesthetic Realists…who are mad at the ''New York Times'' because the ''Times,'' they claim, refuses to print a story that 123 homosexuals have changed (to heterosexuality) through Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Students of the philosophy who said they changed from homosexuality or in other large ways accused the press of unfairly withholding information valuable to the lives of people. In the 1970s they mounted an aggressive campaign of telephone calls, letters, ads, and vigils in front of various media offices and at the homes of editors.&lt;ref&gt;"Some News that’s Unfit to Print," ''New York Magazine'', 17 April 1978, p.8: "Though the ''New York Times'' does a fine job of covering Milanese fashions…it has somehow managed to overlook the Aesthetic Realism story. The Aesthetic Realists do not like this, and they are doing something about it….[They] have disrupted the ''Times'' city desk with more than 65 calls a day from people demanding that the story be run….What is more, the Aesthetic Realists have gone into the city streets, holding vigils in front of publisher Punch Sulzberger’s home and those of other top ''Times'' officials."&lt;/ref&gt; Many wore lapel buttons that read "Victim of the Press".&lt;ref&gt;Nat Hentoff, "Minority protesters trash First Amendment," ''St. Petersburg Times'', Wednesday, May 5, 1993, p. 11A. "For many years in New York's Greenwich Village, decorously dressed followers of poet and guru Eli Siegel ("Hot Afternoons Have Been in Montana") used to wear buttons proclaiming themselves ‘Victims of the Press.’"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Fischkin, ''Muddy Cup: a Dominican Family Comes of Age in a New America'', (NY: Scribner) {{ISBN|0-684-80704-1}}, pages 231-232: "Linda Kunz wore a 'Victim of the Press' button on her lapel. On the first day of class, she wrote this on the blackboard: 'The purpose of all education is to like the world through knowing it--Eli Siegel.' And then this question: 'Can grammar, which is the structure of language, tell us anything about the structure of the world--including ourselves?'"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association declassified homosexuality as a mental disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Bayer, Ronald (1987) ''Homosexuality and American Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 3, p.158, pp. 127-8.  {{ISBN|0-691-02837-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, ads were placed in three major newspapers stating "we have changed from homosexuality through our study of the Aesthetic Realism of Eli Siegel." They were signed by 50 men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Advertisement, "We Have Changed from Homosexuality" March 18, 1978, ''New York Times'', ''Washington Post'', ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt; With few exceptions, the press in general either ignored or dismissed the assertion of persons who said they changed.

The gay press and gay reporters were generally hostile to Aesthetic Realism.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Roskoff, "Gay Activist Allen Roskoff Lets It All Out", ''Queerty'', "…they were telling the gay men that it was unnatural to be homosexual.  Only opposites could attract in art and in life.  The whole philosophy was about opposites, and of course that meant that homosexuality was wrong.  I guess they matched up or convinced men.  Whenever I saw a woman with a button, I would say, ‘What’s the matter, you can’t find a straight man?’  I detested these people. I mean, they were the ex-gay people."&lt;/ref&gt;   A 1982 ''Boston Globe'' article written by "the first openly gay reporter" on its staff,&lt;ref&gt;Obituary of Kay Longcope, ''The Boston Globe'', April 8, 2007.  "Generally regarded as the first openly gay reporter on the newspaper's staff…. Ms. Longcope, who spent 22 years at the ''Globe'' and then founded a statewide gay and lesbian newsweekly in her home state of Texas, died of pancreatic cancer March 28 in Hospice Austin's Christopher House."&lt;/ref&gt; interviewed primarily gay therapists and then reported that the "assertion" of change through Aesthetic Realism was "a claim staggering to psychiatrists and psychologists."&lt;ref&gt;Kay Longcope: "Aesthetic Realism and Homosexuality," ''The Boston Globe'', April 18, 1982. "The assertion of change based on Aesthetic Realism is especially startling to professionals in the psychotherapeutic field after a decade of rethinking homosexuality—a process triggered by the Gay Liberation Movement."&lt;/ref&gt;  About 250 people protested the article on the Boston Common.  The ''Globe’s'' ombudsman later wrote in his column that the article was biased against Aesthetic Realism and that it contained "strong, negative words without attribution" and "inaccuracies".&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Kierstead, Ombudsman, "''Globe'' article on ‘Aesthetic Realism’ and gays prompts complaints," ''The Boston Globe'', 24 May 1982. "On May 13, an estimated 250 people rallied on the Boston Common…in the case of The Boston Globe and the Aesthetic Realism Foundation in New York City….The ''Globe'', once it decided to do the article…also assumed an obligation to spare no effort in thoroughly researching and investigating an organization which espouses a philosophy which is both complex and controversial. [Assistant Living Editor Ed Siegel] and writer Longcope believed that under the circumstances involved the story was fair….The ombudsman disagrees. The story, as published, contains a preponderance of material based on interviews with representatives of the gay community who, for the most part, are not un-biased in their views of Aesthetic Realism….The ombudsman believes the article, not intended as an exposé, contained a negative tone and strong negative words without attribution. It also contained inaccuracies."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some gay advocacy groups and gay activists presented Aesthetic Realism as "anti-gay", accusing the philosophy of offering a "gay cure" and expressing skepticism that homosexuality could or should change.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Gay Cult Pulls Fast One" by Bill Schoell, ''The New York Blade'' April 25, 2008. "Unfortunately, Siegel and his followers believed that homosexuality was an illness ‘caused’ by self-contempt….In the 70s AR…heavily promoted the myth that they could convert people from gay to straight….New York’s Gay Activist Alliance responded by infiltrating [or "zapping"] their meetings at their Greene Street headquarters and passing out pro-gay literature."&lt;/ref&gt;  Persons within the gay pride movement associated the desire of a man to change from homosexuality with a lack of pride in a gay identity, and saw Aesthetic Realism as biased against those living a gay lifestyle.  The Aesthetic Realism Foundation stated unequivocally that it supported full, completely equal civil rights for homosexuals, including the right of a man or woman to live their life in the way they chose.&lt;ref&gt;John Lewis: "Gays Who Have Gone Straight" ''NY Daily News'', March 15, 1981. "Ellen Reiss a teacher at the foundation said: ‘What we offer is a means to have people see themselves and the world as they truly are. We are not interested in grabbing people off the street and saying, "Change." If a person is gay and likes himself and the world and wants to stay that way, fine. But if a person wants to change we offer them a scientific logical approach.’"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to prejudice and racism==
{{Wide image|The People of Clarendon County at The Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center - 20091021.jpg|400px|''"The People of Clarendon County"—A Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presented at the Congressional Auditorium, US Capitol Visitor Center on October 21, 2009 with Lee Central HS Chorus and the Thelma Slater Singers of Bishopville, South Carolina.|50%|right|alt=alt text}}

In one of his earliest essays, "The Equality of Man" (1923), Siegel criticized writers who were promoting [[eugenics]]. He argued that thus far in the history of the world, people have not had equal conditions of life, to bring out their potential abilities, and he asserted that if all men and women had "an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;ref&gt;''The Modern Quarterly Beginnings of Aesthetic Realism 1922-1923'' (NY: Definition Press, 1969), p. 28: "Whatever the reason, no attempt has been made to bring out all the powers of mind that are in each man at birth, by giving it conditions that would fit it best. Worded differently, men have not had an equal chance to be as actively powerful as they might be. And if they had been given an equal chance to use all the powers they had at birth, they would be equal."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Aesthetic Realism, racism and prejudice of all kinds begin with the human inclination towards contempt, "the addition to self through the lessening of something else." Students of the philosophy assert that the racist attitude is not inevitable, but can change if one learns to recognize and criticize contempt. In public forums, individuals of diverse nationalities and cultural backgrounds have described how, through study of Aesthetic Realism, their racism and prejudice changed, not into mere "tolerance" but into a respectful desire to know and to see that the feelings of another are "as real, and as deep, as one’s own."&lt;ref&gt;Susan P. Smith, Hickory, SC Branch, NAACP, "Back to School Rally Offers Answer to Racism," ''Hickory Daily Record,'' Friday, 21 August 2009: "The Belk Centrum Theater at Lenoir Rhyne University was packed Saturday for an intellectually stimulating Back to School Rally sponsored by the Hickory Branch NAACP....This demonstrates that people in this area are ready for new ideas in education and race relations.  Aesthetic Realism views contempt as the cause of racism, 'the addition to self through the lessening of something else'…. The criticism of contempt, including in oneself, and learning to see that the feelings of other people are as real and as deep as one's own, are essential in ending racism."&lt;/ref&gt;

On an international level, proponents advocated the study of contempt and good will, as described by Aesthetic Realism, as "The Only Answer to the Mideast Crisis," in a 1990 advertisement on the op-ed page of ''The New York Times.''&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times,'' 13 October 1990&lt;/ref&gt;  To oppose prejudice they recommend that persons of nations who are in conflict "write a soliloquy of 500 words" describing the feelings of a person in the opposing land.&lt;ref&gt;Oron, Bernstein, Fishman, Gvili, Ratz, Levy, Shazar, "Contempt Must Be Studied for Mideast Terror to End!" ''Aesthetic Realism and the Answer to Racism,'' ed. Bernstein (Orange Angle Press, 2004), p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN commissioned filmmaker Ken Kimmelman, a consultant on the faculty of the Aesthetic Realism Foundation, to make two anti-prejudice films: ''Asimbonanga,'' and ''Brushstrokes.'' Kimmelman credits Aesthetic Realism as his inspiration for these films, as well as his 1995 Emmy-award winning anti-prejudice public service film, ''The Heart Knows Better,'' based on, and including, a statement by Eli Siegel.&lt;ref&gt;Isaac J. Black, ''The Heart Knows Better'', ''The Amsterdam News'', 28 October 1995: "The Heart Knows Better, produced by Ken Kimmelman of Imagery Film Ltd., was just awarded the Emmy for Outstanding National Public Service Film. The film addresses racial prejudice and was inspired by this...statement of Eli Siegel, the American poet and founder of Aesthetic Realism: 'It will be found that black and white man have the same goodnesses, the same temptations, and can be criticized in the same way. The skin may be different, but the aorta is quite the same.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noted speaker on the subject of Aesthetic Realism and how it opposes prejudice and racism is Alice Bernstein, whose articles on the subject have been published in hundreds of papers throughout the country, including in her serialized column, "Alice Bernstein &amp; Friends."&lt;ref&gt;Robin H. King, ''South Carolina Black News'', 18 Dec. 2008: "Many people have been introduced to Alice Bernstein through her nationally published articles, and her column in the ''South Carolina Black News'' for the last five years.  She writes about what she learned  about the cause of and answer to racism from the educational philosophy, Aesthetic Realism."&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Bernstein is the editor of ''The People of Clarendon County'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007), a book that includes a play by Ossie Davis re-discovered by Bernstein, together with historical documents, photographs, and essays about Aesthetic Realism, which she describes as "the education that can end racism." The late Ossie Davis, noted actor and civil rights activist, stated: "Alice Bernstein has dedicated her life to ending racism in this country. ...[She] is writing an introduction [to my play] based on what she has learned about people and history from Aesthetic Realism which she has studied for decades."&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, Alice, ed., ''The People of Clarendon County--A Play by Ossie Davis with Photographs and Historical Documents, and Essays on the Education That Can End Racism'' (Chicago: Third World Press, 2007, p. xiv).&lt;/ref&gt;

A production of ''The People of Clarendon County—a Play by Ossie Davis, &amp; the Answer to Racism,'' presenting Aesthetic Realism as the educational method that explains and changes prejudice and racism, was staged in the Congressional Auditorium of the US Capitol Visitor Center in Washington, DC on October 21, 2009, with introductory remarks given by House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn.&lt;ref&gt;''CapitalWire'', Culture, 1 Nov. 2009: "House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn gave opening remarks at a historic event on Capitol Hill in Washington, October 21st: ''The People of Clarendon County—A Play by Ossie Davis &amp; the Answer to Racism!''"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and response==
The organization has also been accused by some ex-students and cult researchers for operating as a [[cult]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelbluejay.com/x/jewishtimes.html Monumental Man: The Controversial Legacy of Eli Siegel], Melissa Goldman, Jewish Times, August 22, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-05-06/news/political-surrealism/&lt;/ref&gt; Some former and current students of the philosophy have responded in a website titled "Countering the Lies," saying that the technique of the persons who want to discredit Aesthetic Realism is "1) to find out what characteristics a cult is supposed to have and, 2) then say Aesthetic Realism has them (though of course it doesn't)."&lt;ref&gt;http://counteringthelies.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|date=November 2009}}
'''Airport novel(s)''' represent a [[literary genre]] that is not so much defined by its [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] or cast of [[stock character]]s, as much as it is by the social function it serves.  An airport novel is typically a fairly long but fast-paced [[novel]] of intrigue or adventure that is stereotypically found in the reading fare offered by [[airport]] [[newsstand]]s.

Considering the marketing of fiction as a trade, airport novels occupy a niche similar to the one that once was occupied by [[pulp magazine]] fiction and other reading materials typically sold at newsstands and [[kiosk]]s to travellers.  This pulp fiction is one obvious source for the genre; sprawling [[historical novel]]s of exotic adventure such as those by [[James A. Michener|James Michener]] and [[James Clavell]] are another source.  In [[French language|French]], such novels are called ''romans de gare'', "[[train station|railway station]] novels",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Romans de gare|work=Harper-Collins French-English Dictionary|publisher=Harper-Collins|date= 2007|isbn= 978-0-00-728044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting that writers in France were aware of this potential market at an even earlier date.&lt;ref name="Sweeney, Seamus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialaffairsunit.org.uk/blog/archives/000327.php |title=A New Genre: The Record Store Book|website=The Social Affairs Unit|author=Sweeney, Seamus}}&lt;/ref&gt; The somewhat dated, Dutch term 'stationsroman' is a [[calque]] from French.

==Meeting the reading needs of travelers==
An airport novel must necessarily be superficially engaging, while not being particularly profound or philosophical, or at least, without such content being necessary for enjoyment of the book. The reader is not a person alone, in a quiet setting, contemplating deep thoughts or savouring fine writing; the reader is being jostled and penned among strangers, and seeks distraction from the boredom and inconveniences of travel. Similarly, the reader is not in a position to consult reference works, scholarly papers, or the author's previous works. The writer of an airport novel must meet the needs of readers in this situation.

The realisation that this niche market for [[mass market paperback]]s had given rise to a new genre was slow in coming. Perhaps a defining moment in the history of the genre came in 1968, when [[Arthur Hailey]] published ''[[Airport (novel)|Airport]]'', an airport novel that used the commercial flight industry to frame an adventure yarn about a disaster in an airport.&lt;ref name="Fear of Flying"&gt;Sarah Vowell, [http://www.salon.com/ent/music/vowe/1998/08/24vowe.html ''Fear of Flying''] at salon.com, byline Aug. 24, 1998, accessed Mar. 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hailey's other novels, [[soap opera]] tales with complex plots of adultery and intrigue featuring business characters, using a number of other industries as backdrops (e.g. ''[[The Final Diagnosis]]'' ([[hospital]]s); ''[[Hotel (novel)|Hotel]]'' ([[hotel]]s);  ''[[Wheels (novel)|Wheels]]'' ([[automobile]] industry); ''[[The Moneychangers]]'' ([[banking]]) represented an emerging genre.

==Format==
{{Original research|date=May 2010}}
{{Refimprove|date=May 2010}}
Airport novels are always [[paperback book]]s of a small but thick format. These books are often printed on inexpensive [[newsprint]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Their titles are often printed in a gilded, silvery or vividly scarlet finish, which more often than not starts very quickly to dissolve and stick to the reader's fingertips. This is not a problem for their intended purpose; they are made to be bought on impulse, and their readers often discard them when finished.

Airport novels are typically quite long books; a book that a reader was able to finish before the journey was done would similarly be unsatisfying.  Because of this length, the genre attracts prolific authors, who use their output as a sort of [[brand]]ing; each author is identified with a certain sort of story, and produces many variations of the same thing.  Well-known authors' names are usually in type larger than the title on the covers of airport novels, often in [[Embossing (paper)|embossed]] letters.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Cathcart, ''[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/atoday/stories/s153446.htm Airport art: what is it?]''.  [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], byline July 17, 2000, accessed Mar. 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
Airport novels typically fall within a number of other [[genre fiction|fictional genres]], including:

* [[Crime fiction]]
* [[Detective fiction]]
* [[Historical romance]]
* [[Spy fiction]]
* [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]s

Whatever the genre, the books must be fast-paced and easy to read.  The description "airport novel" is mildly [[pejorative]]; it implies that the book has little lasting value, and is useful chiefly as an inexpensive form of entertainment during travel.  Airport novels are sometimes contrasted with [[literary fiction]]; so that a novel with literary aspirations would be disparaged by the label.&lt;ref&gt;Bridget Kulakauskas, [http://www.illiterarty.com/genre-airport-novel Genre: ''Airport novel''] at illiterarty.com, no date; accessed Mar. 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this theme, the animated television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' included a joke in the episode "[[The Joy of Sect]]" (airdate February 8, 1998), in which an airport bookstore is named "JUST [[Michael Crichton|CRICHTON]] AND [[Stephen King|KING]]".

'''An Lanntair''' ({{IPA-gd|əˈl̪ˠãũn̪ˠt̪ɛɾʲ|lang}}) is an arts centre in the town of [[Stornoway]] in the [[Outer Hebrides]] of Scotland. The centre is home to a [[Movie theater|cinema]], and [[art gallery]]. Previously located in the Town Hall, in September 2005 An Lanntair moved to its current new building overlooking the harbour. This building features a 50-seater restaurant, art gallery, shop, and auditorium seating over two hundred. The auditorium houses the first cinema in Stornoway since 1995.

An Lanntair is the principal venue for arts and entertainment events in Stornoway and regularly hosts performances by musicians as well as plays, talks, and films. It is a key venue for the annual [[Hebridean Celtic Festival]], and has hosted events for the [[Royal National Mòd]] in 2005 and 2011.

Its name is [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] for ''the lantern''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="843">'''The Apology Project''', a 1980 conceptual art project, was created by [[Allan Bridge]] who employed the pseudonym Mr. Apology. Bridge used an [[answering machine]] to record confessions from anonymous callers. More than 1000 hours of confession were recorded, ranging from common confessions to ritualistic murders.

Some of the confessions were published in Bridge's magazine ''Apology''.

This Apology Project is not to be confused with the Apology Project of Elliniko Teatro, a theatrical production based on Plato's The Apology of Socrates, featuring Yannis Simonides (see http://www.ellinikotheatro.org.)

The '''''Arts &amp; Humanities Citation Index''''' ('''A&amp;HCI'''), also known as '''''Arts &amp; Humanities Search''''', is a [[citation index]], with abstracting and indexing for more than 1,700 arts and humanities journals, and coverage of disciplines that includes social and natural science journals. Part of this database is derived from [[Current Contents]] records. Furthermore, the print counterpart is Current Contents.

Subjects covered are the Arts, Humanities, Language (including Linguistics), Poetry, Music, Classical works, History, Oriental Studies, Philosophy, Archaeology, Architecture, Religion, Television, Theater, and Radio.

Available citation (source) coverage includes articles, letters, editorials, meeting abstracts, errata, poems, short stories, plays, music scores, excerpts from books, chronologies, bibliographies and filmographies, as well as citations to reviews of books, films, music, and theatrical performances.

This database can be accessed online through ''[[Web of Science]]''. It provides access to current and retrospective bibliographic information and cited references. It also covers individually selected, relevant items from approximately 1,200 titles, mostly arts and humanities journals but with an unspecified number of titles from other disciplines.

According to Thomson Reuters, the ''Arts &amp; Humanities Search'', can be accessed via Dialog, DataStar, and OCLC, with weekly updates and backfiles to 1980.&lt;ref name=dialog-blue&gt;

The '''Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)''' is an organization comprising universities located in North America that offer graduate programs in the field of art [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]]. Each association member's primary mission is to provide education and training in conservation through the awarding of an accredited degree. Since 1974, the conservation graduate programs have held an annual meeting at one of the member programs in order to give current students the opportunity to present current research to their peers.

==History==
[[File:Corning Museum of Glass.jpg|thumb|left|The Corning Museum of Glass, site of the first conference held by the North American graduate programs in conservation]]The first conference of North American graduate programs in the conservation of art and other cultural property was held in 1974 at the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] in response to a flood that damaged the museum's artifact and library collection on June 23, 1972. While only three percent of the museum's glass collection sustained damage, over half of the museum's library holdings were lost or severely devastated.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC book"&gt;{{cite book|author=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)|title=North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property, Histories &amp; Alumni|date=2000|publisher=ANAGPIC|location=Buffalo, NY|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/anagpic/histalum_full.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This five-day conference entitled, "Conservation Seminar on Glass and Library Materials," was organized by Dr. [[Robert H. Brill]], the Corning Museum's research scientist. For the first time, this conference brought together students, faculty, conservators, curators, and other museum specialists for several days of lectures and discussions on the field of conservation. Five American programs and a contingent from the Canadian Conservation Institute were in attendance; [[State University of New York at Oneonta|Cooperstown Graduate Program]], [[Winterthur Museum, Garden and Library|Winterthur]]/[[University of Delaware]], [[Intermuseum Conservation Association]], [[New York University]], [[Canadian Conservation Institute]], and the [[Fogg Art Museum]]. Since the Corning Museum conference, annual meetings have become an integral part of ANAGPIC as a way to provide insight into the quality of the education provided by each program represented. Notable conservation professionals also present lectures during the conferences that address a specific area of interest in conservation, such as "Extreme Conservation" at the 2014 ANAGPIC conference. These lectures provide students with powerful insight on important issues for their future careers.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC book"/&gt;

The Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) was founded in May, 1984 by the following organizations: Buffalo State College, State University of New York, Art Conservation Department; Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies; New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts; Queen’s University, Art Conservation Program; Winterthur/University of Delaware Program in Art Conservation; The University of Texas at Austin, School of Information, Kilgarlin Center for Preservation of the Cultural Record.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"&gt;{{cite web|author=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC)|title=ANAGPIC Bylaws|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/anagpic/bylaws.htm|publisher=Conservation OnLine (CoOL)|accessdate=14 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

The general purpose of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC) is to “help serve the need of the conservation field for well-trained professional conservators by aiding its member training programs to attain their educational objectives.”&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"/&gt;

In order for organizations to be eligible for membership, they must have provided conservation training for at least three consecutive years, and they must award a diploma, degree, or certificate formally acknowledged by their parent academic association. Within that parent institution, the member organization must be a distinct program, whose primary mission is conservation education and training. The program's curriculum must have substantial components of problem-solving in conservation and conservation science, and should conform to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice. The student to faculty ratio must also be no greater than ten students per faculty member, and these faculty members must have professional qualifications to teach conservation at a graduate level. This can be demonstrated through substantial professional recognition through the [[International Institute for Conservation]] of Historic and Artistic Works (IIC), the [[American Institute for Conservation]] of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC), or the Canadian Association of Professional Conservators (CAPC).&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"/&gt;

At least one meeting of the ANAGPIC is held annually, normally concurrent with the annual Conference of the Conservation Training Programs, at present held in late spring. Typically, each institution is represented by two student presenters. Other meetings can be called as necessary if agreed to by at least two-thirds of the membership. Each member organization is normally represented by the training program director/chairperson.&lt;ref name="ANAGPIC Bylaws"/&gt;

==Current members==

===Buffalo State College, SUNY, Art Conservation Department===
[[File:Rockwell hall.JPG|thumb|right|Rockwell Hall at Buffalo State College, where graduate courses in art conservation are held.]] Buffalo State College's Art Conservation Department was founded in 1970 as the Cooperstown Graduate Program in the Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works, affiliated with the State University of New York College at Oneonta and with the New York State Historical Association in Cooperstown. In 1983, the program transferred to Buffalo State College, and then relocated to its campus in 1987. Since its founding, Buffalo State offers a master of arts degree and certificate of advanced study in art conservation upon the completion of a three-year graduate program which trains conservators of fine art and material cultural heritage. This program accepts only 10 students per academic year. [[Buffalo State College|Buffalo State]] is the largest four-year college of arts and sciences in the [[State University of New York]] (SUNY) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History - Art Conservation - Buffalo State |url=http://artconservation.buffalostate.edu/history |publisher=Buffalo State College |accessdate=21 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430053003/http://artconservation.buffalostate.edu/history |archivedate=30 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buffalo State's campus also hosts the [[Burchfield Penney Art Center]] and located across the street from the [[Albright-Knox Art Gallery]].

&lt;big&gt;'''Program Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Art Conservation, M.A., C.A.S.'''

*''First Year'' - Students take courses in conservation imaging, documentation and examination, conservation science, and in the specialties of paper, paintings, and objects.
*''Second Year'' - Students continue to take conservation imaging, examination and documentation as well as conservation science, but they focus primarily on their chosen area of specialization (objects, paintings, or paper). Students may also choose a subspecialty, such as ethnographic or archaeological objects, photographs, or books.

===Harvard University Art Museums, Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies===

&lt;big&gt;'''Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

The Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies provides analysis and treatments for the [[Harvard Art Museums]]’ collection, consisting of more than 250,000 objects in all media, ranging in date from [[classic antiquity|antiquity]] to the present. The Department of Technical Studies became the first institution in the United States to use scientific methods to study artists’ materials and techniques when it was founded in 1928 by Edward W. Forbes, director of Harvard University’s [[Fogg Museum]]. In 1994, the center was renamed the Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies in honor of Philip A. and Lynn Straus, who were longtime benefactors of the Harvard Art Museums. In 1972, with the support from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the Straus Center began their Advanced-Level Training Program which provides formal hands-on training in the conservation of works on paper, paintings, and objects and sculpture, as well as in conservation science. They offer three 10-month fellowships each year in which fellows can refine their practical and analytical skills through the examination and treatment of works of art from the Harvard Art Museums' collections. Fellows also have the chance to publish their original research.&lt;ref name=Straus&gt;{{cite web|title=Straus Center for Conservation and Technical Studies|url=http://www.harvardartmuseums.org/study-research/straus|publisher=Harvard Art Museums|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York University, Conservation Center, Institute of Fine Arts===

The Conservation Center of the [[Institute of Fine Arts]] at [[New York University]] (NYU) was founded in 1960 with support from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]]. Since that time, the program has called for equal measures of art historical study, scientific training, and practical conservation experience. The goal was to produce a professional who would approach each object as an individual entity. The solution to an object's condition issues would be determined through research and study, unlike the tradesman restorer’s approach, which applied standard treatments to objects and problems.&lt;ref name="NYU History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Center|url=http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/fineart/conservation/history.htm|publisher=Institute of Fine Arts, New York University|accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other conservation graduate programs, NYU awards a four-year, dual-degree graduate program where students earn both their Master’s in art history and Advanced Certificate in conservation. The Conservation Center is also the oldest degree-granting conservation program in North America.

&lt;big&gt;'''Program Overview'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''Art History, M.A. with Advanced Certificate in Conservation'''

*''First Year'' - Students gain an understanding of materials and technology, with a heavy emphasis on direct observation. No treatment is carried out during the first year, apart from simple treatment methodologies carried out in ''Principles of Conservation''. Students must also successfully pass a language translation exam within their first year of study, in the language of their choosing - French, German or Italian.
*''Second Year'' - Students complete core classes and begin training in their specialized area of study at the Conservation Center, as well as museums and private laboratories in NYC. Students also have the ability to pursue independent research projects in areas of particular interest to them.
*''Third Year'' - Students continue upper-level conservation treatment coursework in their area of concentration and complete any remaining requirements for the MA degree in art history, including the completion of the Master’s Thesis.
*''Fourth Year'' - Students complete a nine-month internship in their area of specialization at an established conservation institution. Students can complete this internship in the United States or abroad.

'''Burnishing''' is a form of [[pottery]] treatment in which the surface of the pot is [[Polishing|polished]], using a hard smooth surface such as a wooden or bone spatula, smooth stones, plastic, or even glass bulbs, while it still is in a leathery 'green' state, i.e., before [[Pottery#Firing|firing]]. After firing, the surface is extremely shiny. Often the whole outer surface of the pot is thus decorated, but in certain [[ceramic]] traditions there is 'pattern burnishing' where the outside and, in the case of open bowls, the inside, are decorated with burnished patterns in which some areas are left [[Gloss (paint)|matte]].

This technique can be applied to [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete masonry]], creating a polished [[Surface finishing|finish]]. 

Burnishing can also be applied to wood, by rubbing two pieces together along the [[Wood grain|grain]]. Hard woods take the treatment best.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Burnishing does not protect the wood like a [[varnish]] does, but does impart a glossy sheen.

If one wood has a [[dye]] in it or is colored in some way, it may rub off onto the other wood. Burnishing can also apply to [[relief printing]].

[[File:Chalcography.PNG|thumb|266px|Chalcography technology, plate of German ''poeta laureatus'' Ambrosius Hannemann (died in 1644)]]

'''Chalcography''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] chalcos, copper and graphia, to write), are engravings on [[copper]] plates used for printmaking and for illustrations in the production of books. The ''[[Monte dei Santi di Dio]]'' by [[Antonio Bettini]] is the most ancient book bearing chalcographies, printed in [[Florence]] on September 10, 1477 from [[Nicolo di Lorenzo Tedesco]]. Its primacy is contested by [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Cosmographia]]'', printed in [[Bologna]] on June 23, 1477 from [[Domenico de' Lapi]], a [[Latin]] translation from [[Jacopo d'Angelo]], containing geographical charts and maps by [[Taddeo Crivelli]], engraved in copper plates.

'''''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs''''' (working title: '''''So White and de Sebben Dwarfs''''') is a ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' [[animation|animated]] cartoon directed by [[Bob Clampett]], produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]], and released to theatres on January 16, 1943 by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[The Vitaphone Corporation]].&lt;ref name="bcdb"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/7484-Coal_Black_And_De_Sebben_Dwarfs.html|title=Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs|publisher=BCDB|date=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is an all-[[African American|black]] parody of the [[Brothers Grimm]] [[fairy tale]] ''[[Snow White]]'', known to its audience from the popular 1937 [[Walt Disney]] animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''. The stylistic portrayal of the characters is an example of [[blackface|"darky" iconography]], which was widely accepted in [[United States|American]] society at the time. As such, it is one of the most controversial cartoons in the classic Warner Brothers library, being one of the [[Censored Eleven]]. The cartoon has been rarely seen on television, and has never been officially released on home video.

==History==
[[Image:1942 Coal Black And De Sebben Dwarfs Ad.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Coal Black'' lobby card. The character designs for "So White" and her seven friends are examples of the 'darky' iconography typical of Hollywood animation during the first half of the 20th century. As a result, ''Coal Black'' and similar cartoons have been removed from circulation and are little known today among mainstream audiences.]]

===Overview===
In this version of the story, all of the characters are black, and speak all of their dialogue in rhyme. The story is set during World War II in the [[United States]], and the original tale's [[fairy tale]] wholesomeness is replaced in this film by a hot [[jazz]] mentality and sexual overtones. Several scenes unique to Disney's film version of ''Snow White'', such as the wishing-well sequence, the forest full of staring eyes, and the awakening kiss, are directly parodied in this film. The film was intended to have been named ''So White and de Sebben Dwarfs'', which producer [[Leon Schlesinger]] thought was too close to the original film's actual title, and had changed to ''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Clampett intended ''Coal Black'' as both a parody of ''Snow White'' and a dedication to the all-black jazz [[musical film]]s popular in the early 1940s (i.e. ''[[Cabin in the Sky (film)|Cabin in the Sky]]'', ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'', etc.). In fact, the idea to produce ''Coal Black'' came to Clampett after he saw [[Duke Ellington]]'s 1941 musical revue ''Jump for Joy'', and Ellington and the cast suggested Clampett make a black musical cartoon.&lt;ref name="bcdb" /&gt; The Clampett unit made a couple of field trips to Club Alabam, a [[Los Angeles]] area black club, to get a feel for the music and the dancing, and Clampett cast popular radio actors as the voices of his three main characters. The main character, So White, is voiced by [[Vivian Dandridge]], sister of actress [[Dorothy Dandridge]]. Their mother, [[Ruby Dandridge]], voices the [[Queen (Snow White) in derivative works|Wicked Queen]] (or rather her sweet voice and evil cackle, while for the majority of the cartoon, the Queen's true voice, which is low and raspy, is played by Danny Webb). [[Leo Watson]] is the voice of "Prince Chawmin'". The other characters, including the Sebben Dwarfs, are voiced by standard Warner Bros. voice artist [[Mel Blanc]].

Originally, Clampett wanted an all-black band to score the cartoon, the same way [[Max Fleischer|Max]] and [[Dave Fleischer]] had [[Cab Calloway|Cab Calloway and His Orchestra]] score the ''[[Betty Boop]]'' cartoons ''[[Minnie the Moocher]]'', ''[[The Old Man of the Mountain (1933 cartoon)|The Old Man of the Mountain]]'', and their own version of ''[[Snow White (1933 cartoon)|Snow White]]''. However, Schlesinger refused, and the black band Clampett had hired, Eddie Beals and His Orchestra, only recorded the music for the final kiss sequence. The rest of the film was scored, as was standard for Warner Bros. cartoons, by [[Carl W. Stalling]].

===Synopsis===
''Coal Black'' opens in front of a fireplace with a red-tinted silhouette of a large woman holding a young child in her lap. The little black girl asks her "[[mammy archetype|mammy]]" to tell her the story of "So White an' de Sebben Dwarfs". "Mammy" begins:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, once there was a ''mean'' ol' queen. And she lived in a gorgeous castle. And was that ole' gal rich! She was just as rich as she was mean! She had ''everythang!''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The rich, [[Queen (Snow White)|Wicked Queen]] then appears, depicted as a "food hoarder", with a large repository of items that were on ration during [[World War II]]: rubber, sugar, gin ("[[Eli Whitney]]'s [[cotton gin|Cotton Gin]]" brand) and more. After stuffing her face with candies (from a box marked "[[Chattanooga Choo Choo|Chattanooga Chew-Chews]]"), she asks her magic mirror to "send her a prince 'bout six feet tall", (2 metres) but when Prince Chawmin' arrives in his flashy car, he declares "that mean ol' queen sho' is a fright / but her gal So White is dyn-a-mite!" Finding So White hard at work doing the laundry, the prince takes her hand and the two swing out into a wild [[jitterbug]]. The queen sees this and hires "[[Murder, Inc.|Murder, Incorporated]]" to "black-out So White."  The assassins arrive in a panel truck that advertises, "We rub out anybody for $1.00; [[Midget]]s: 1/2-price; [[Jap]]s: free". ([[US$]]1 would be equal to US${{Format price|{{Inflation|US|1|1943|r=2}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}}.{{Inflation-fn|US}})

The assassins kidnap the girl, but after several unseen "favors" which make the would-be assassins very happy, set her free in the woods unharmed. Just before they drive off, the assassins are seen covered with So White's lipstick, an [[innuendo]] as to exactly how she earned her freedom. Wandering through the woods by herself, So White runs into the Sebben Dwarfs, seven diminutive army men in uniform who sing "[[You're in the Army Now (song)|We're in the Army Now]]," with two dwarfs singing "it takes us cats ... to catch them rats" at the end, and So White declares in a 1940s swing-style singing voice, "I'm wacky over khaki now!" They immediately recruit her as their squad cook, and she spends her days "fryin' up eggs an' pork chops too" (to the tune of "Five O'Clock Whistle") for the hungry soldiers, as a sign which hangs from her outdoor antique stove reads, "Keep 'em frying," as a sendup of the World War II slogan, "Keep 'Em Flying."

Meanwhile, the queen has learned that So White is still alive, and pumps an apple full of poison to give to the girl and kill her.  Several worms escape the apple as the queen injects it with poison, one carrying a sign that says "Refoogies."  The queen disguises herself as an old peddler woman, and arrives at the Sebben Dwarfs' camp and gives So White the poisoned apple. One of the seven dwarfs (modeled on the "Dopey" dwarf in Disney's film) alerts the others that the queen has caused So White to "kick the bucket," and the entire squad hops into its vehicles (a [[Jeep]], a "Beep," and, for "Dopey," a "Peep"). As the queen makes her escape over the hills, the dwarfs load a cannon with both a war shell and "Dopey." The shell sails over to the queen, stops in front of her in mid-air, opens, and "Dopey" appears, knocking the crone out with a mallet.

Even though the queen has been defeated, So White is still dead to the world. The dwarfs note, in spoken rhyme:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
She's outta this world! She's stiff as wood!
[[I Got It Bad (and That Ain't Good)|She's got it bad, and that ain't good!]]
There's only one thing that'll remedy this
and dat's Prince Chawmin' and his Dynamite [[Kiss]]!
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Upon the dwarfs' invoking his name, the prince jumps into the scene in a spotlight and promises to "give her a kiss / and it won't be a dud / I'll bring her to life with my special 'Rosebud'", a nod to ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Wiping his lip and leaning over the girl in preparation, Prince Chawmin' proceeds to give So White a succession of highly aerobic kisses, practically swallowing the girl's face whole in trying to awaken her, but without any luck. Prince Chawmin' keeps frantically kissing So White (his efforts underscored by a solo from Eddie Beale's trumpet player), and the efforts literally take the life out of him as he first turns blue in the face, before turning into a withered old, pale-faced man, shrugging his shoulders in defeat. The "Dopey" dwarf then saunters over to So White, and, to the tune of "You're in the Army Now," lays a kiss on the girl so dynamic that not only does So White wake up, but her eyes become large as saucers and her pigtails fly straight up into the air (depicted in Rod Scribner's typically extreme animation style) as she jumps into the air.

The worn-out and aged Prince asks "Dopey," "Man, what you got that makes So White think ''you'' so hot?!" "Dopey" replies, with the only non-rhyming line in the cartoon, "well, dat is a military secret," and lays another kiss on So White, which sends her pigtails sailing into the air again and causes the red ribbons on them to turn into twin [[Flag of the United States|American flag]]s, to several notes of "[[The Stars and Stripes Forever]]", and immediately after the kiss, So White and "Dopey" both show an obvious "afterglow" in their eyes and their smile. The film then fades to the standard ''Merrie Melodies'' "That's all, Folks!" end title text, superimposed over a shot of the little girl and her "mammy" from the opening scene.

===Race controversy===

In April, 1943, the [[NAACP]] protested the caricatures which appeared in ''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=https://thadkomorowski.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/naacp-coal-black.pdf|title=Memorandum to Mr. White from Miss Harper|date=1943-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |url=http://www.egusd.net/franklinhs/MediaCom/Animation1/Animation1_Term2/Coal_Black_Questions.htm|title=Coal Black Questions|publisher=Elk Grove Unified School District}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Coal Black and de Sebben Dwarfs'' is notorious for being one of the "[[Censored Eleven]]": 11 Schlesinger/Warner Bros. cartoons produced at the height of the [[Hollywood Animation: The Golden Age|Golden Age of Hollywood animation]] based on its unflattering and stereotypical use of [[darky iconography]]. Because it was produced in America during [[World War II]], there is also [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]: the firm "Murder Inc." advertises that it does not charge to kill "Japs".

The same basic stereotypical elements present in the earlier Censored Eleven films are also present in ''Coal Black'', depicted with more detail and made to conform to Clampett's "wacky" directorial style. The Prince, a vague [[Cab Calloway]] lookalike, is depicted as a slender, [[zoot suit]]ed Black man with [[straightened hair]], a [[monocle]], and gold teeth (with dice in place of the front two incisors). Both he and the dwarfs are drawn with large eyes, small noses, and unnaturally large pink lips, derived from the appearance of a white man in [[blackface]] rather than that of an actual black man. The middle-aged wicked Queen is depicted as an overweight, asexual [[Hag|crone]], with large lips that are only partially covered with lipstick (the Queen's lipstick only extends as far as it would if her lips were proportionate to her face).

Only So White escapes the extreme caricature given the other characters, although she is stereotyped in a different manner. She is designed as an attractive young woman with a voluptuous figure revealed by a short skirt and a low-cut, cleavage-revealing blouse. The sexualization of So White recalls [[Walter Lantz]]'s 1941 cartoon ''[[Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat]]'', where a young light-skinned Black woman is depicted as attractive while the other Black characters are drawn as extreme caricatures. In both that film and ''Coal Black'', the sexually attractive features of the young women are significant plot devices. In ''Coal Black'', So White is the object of sexual desire for every male character in the picture. This draws upon the stereotype of the young attractive black woman as an "exotic" sexual being, a stereotype present in roles that African-American actresses such as [[Dorothy Dandridge]] and [[Lena Horne]] played in American cinema.

Clampett would revisit black jazz culture again in another 1943 Merrie Melodies cartoon, ''[[Tin Pan Alley Cats]]'', which features a feline caricature of [[Fats Waller]] in a repurposing of the wacky fantasy world from ''[[Porky in Wackyland]]'' (during the opening sequence, the "Fats" cat is distracted by what appears to be So White). Clampett's colleague [[Friz Freleng]] directed a cartoon titled ''[[Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears]]'' in 1944, essentially ''Coal Black'' remade with a different fairy tale, and Warner's director [[Chuck Jones]] directed a series of shorts starring a prepubescent [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] hunter named [[Inki]] from 1939 to 1950. Like ''Coal Black'', ''Tin Pan Alley Cats'' and ''Goldilocks and the Jivin' Bears'' would also end up in the Censored Eleven.

Bob Clampett claimed in the cartoon's defense that;

{{quote|In 1942, during the height of anti-Japanese sentiment during [[World War II]], I was approached in Hollywood by the cast of an all-black musical off-broadway production called ''Jump For Joy'' while they were doing some special performances in Los Angeles. They asked me why there weren't any Warner's cartoons with black characters and I didn't have any good answer for that question. So we sat down together and came up with a parody of Disney's "[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs|Snow White]]" and "Coal Black" was the result. They did all the voices for that cartoon, even though Mel Blanc's contract with Warners gave him sole voice credit for all Warners cartoons by then. There was nothing racist or disrespectful toward blacks intended in that film at all, nor in ''Tin Pan Alley Cats'' which is just a parody of jazz piano great Fats Waller, who was always hamming into the camera during his musical films. Everybody, including blacks had a good time when these cartoons first came out. All the controversy about these two cartoons has developed in later years merely because of changing attitudes toward black civil rights that have happened since then.}}

===''Coal Black'' in later years===
The racially stereotyped portrayals of African-Americans in ''Coal Black'' and the other "[[Censored Eleven]]" cartoons led to their being suppressed from [[television]] broadcast. In 1968, [[United Artists]], which then owned the rights to the pre-August 1948&lt;ref&gt;The latest released WB cartoon sold to a.a.p. was ''[[Haredevil Hare]]'', released on July 24, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Warner Bros. cartoon library, officially banned the cartoons from circulation, and they have not been officially broadcast or released on [[home video]] since - even as the rights returned to Warners.

''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs'' is often praised and defended by film scholars and animation historians, and has often been included on lists of the greatest animated films ever made. One such list, the subject of [[Jerry Beck]]'s 1994 book ''[[The 50 Greatest Cartoons]]'', placed ''Coal Black'' at number 21, based upon votes from over 1000 members of the American animation industry. Scholarly animation texts including [[Michael Barrier (historian)|Michael Barrier]]'s ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age'',&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barrier [https://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Cartoons-American-Animation-Golden/dp/0195167295 ''Hollywood Cartoons: American Animation in Its Golden Age''], 2003, Oxford University Press, 978-0195167290&lt;/ref&gt; name ''Coal Black'' as Clampett's undisputed masterpiece.  Despite its being banned, ''Coal Black'' is a popular draw at [[film festivals]] and small-audience screenings, and is often [[copyright infringement|bootlegged]] for release on home video.

It was seen briefly in the 1989 [[Turner Entertainment]] VHS release ''Cartoons For Big Kids'', hosted by [[Leonard Maltin]], and in the ''Behind the Tunes'' featurette "Once Upon a Looney Tune", which is included in the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 5]]'' [[DVD]] box set.

On April 24, 2010, ''Coal Black and De Sebben Dwarfs'', along with seven other titles from the [[Censored Eleven]], was screened at the first annual [[Turner Classic Movies]] (TCM) Film Festival as part of a special presentation hosted by film historian [[Donald Bogle]]; the eight shorts shown were restored for that release.

'''The coat of arms of [[Ecuador]]''' (Spanish: ''Escudo de armas del Ecuador'') in its current form was established in 1900 based on an older version of 1845.

==Blazon==
In the background of the oval [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] is the volcano [[Chimborazo (volcano)|Chimborazo]], while the river originating from its base represents the [[Guayas River|Guayas]].  They both symbolize the beauty and wealth of the respective regions (Sierra or Costa). The ship on the river is named ''Guayas'' as well. In 1841 it was built in [[Guayaquil]] and was the first riverine steamship built on the South American west coast; instead of a mast it features a [[Caduceus]] representing trade and economy. On top [[Inti]] in form of a golden sun surrounded by the astronomical signs for [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] and [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]] representing the months March to July to symbolize the duration of the [[Marcist Revolution|March Revolution]] of 1845.

The [[condor]] on top of the shield stretches his wings to symbolize power, greatness and strength of Ecuador. The shield is flanked by four [[Flag of Ecuador|flags of Ecuador]]. The laurel on the left represents the victories of the republic.&lt;ref&gt;Other descriptions attribute it to the symbolism of the glory of the heroes of independence.&lt;/ref&gt; The palm leaf on the right side is a symbol of the martyrs of the fight for independence and liberty. The [[fasces]] below the shield represents the republican dignity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Minahan |first=James |date=2010 |title=The Complete Guide to National Symbols and Emblems (Vol. 1)|url=http://www.abc-clio.com/ABC-CLIOCorporate/product.aspx?pc=B2180C |location= |publisher=Greenword Press |page=240 |isbn=978-0313344961 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

==History==
The shield was introduced after the victory of the liberal revolution of 1845, but then flanked by white-blue-white flags;  which were then replaced in the reintroduction of the [[Flag of Ecuador|''Tricolor'']] flags. The coat of arms in its current form was approved by congress on October 31, 1900.

The coat of arms is used by the President, the parliament, the ministries and several other authorities and public institutions. It is part of the flag, and used on many coins and bills of the former currency [[Ecuadorian sucre|Sucre]] and the coins used today, ''Centavos del [[United States dollar|dólar]]'' of Ecuadorian mintage.

==Guiding designs by performance improvements==
[[File:Computer-automated design.png|thumb|right|350px|Interaction in computer-automated design]]
To meet the ever-growing demand of quality and competitiveness, iterative physical prototyping is now often replaced by '[[digital prototyping]]' of a 'good design', which aims to meet multiple objectives such as maximised output, energy efficiency, highest speed and cost-effectiveness. The design problem concerns both finding the best design within a known range (i.e., through 'learning' or 'optimisation') and finding a new and better design beyond the existing ones (i.e., through creation and invention). This is equivalent to a [[search problem]] in an almost certainly, multidimensional (multivariate), multi-modal space with a single (or weighted) objective or multiple objectives.

==Normalized objective function: cost vs. fitness==
Using single-objective CAutoD as an example, if the objective function, either as a [[Loss function|cost function]] &lt;math&gt;J\in[0, \infty)&lt;/math&gt;, or inversely, as a [[fitness function]] &lt;math&gt;f\in(0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, where

:&lt;math&gt;f = \tfrac{J}{1+J}&lt;/math&gt;,

is differentiable under practical constraints in the multidimensional space, the design problem may be solved analytically. Finding the parameter sets that result in a zero first-order derivative and that satisfy the second-order derivative conditions would reveal all local optima. Then comparing the values of the performance index of all the local optima, together with those of all boundary parameter sets, would lead to the global optimum, whose corresponding 'parameter' set will thus represent the best design.  However, in practice, the optimization usually involves multiple objectives and the matters involving derivatives are lot more complex.

==Dealing with practical objectives==
In practice, the objective value may be noisy or even non-numerical, and hence its gradient information may be unreliable or unavailable. This is particularly true when the problem is multi-objective.  At present, many designs and refinements are mainly made through a manual trial-and-error process with the help of a CAD [[simulation]] package. Usually, such ''[[a posteriori]]'' learning or adjustments need to be repeated many times until a ‘satisfactory’ or ‘optimal’ design emerges.

==Exhaustive search==
In theory, this adjustment process can be automated by computerised search, such as [[exhaustive search]].  As this is an [[exponential algorithm]], it may not deliver solutions in practice within a limited period of time.

==Search in polynomial time==
One approach to [[virtual engineering]] and automated design is [[evolutionary computation]] such as [[evolutionary algorithm]]s.

===Evolutionary algorithms===
To reduce the search time, the biologically-inspired evolutionary algorithm (EA) can be used instead, which is a (non-deterministic) [[Exponential algorithm#Polynomial time|polynomial algorithm]].  The EA based multi-objective "search team" can be interfaced with an existing CAD simulation package in a batch mode. The EA encodes the design parameters (encoding being necessary if some parameters are non-numerical) to refine multiple candidates through parallel and interactive search. In the search process, '[[natural selection|selection]]' is performed using '[[survival of the fittest]]' ''a posteriori'' learning. To obtain the next 'generation' of possible solutions, some parameter values are exchanged between two candidates (by an operation called '[[Crossover (genetic algorithm)|crossover]]') and new values introduced (by an operation called '[[mutation]]'). This way, the evolutionary technique makes use of past trial information in a similarly intelligent manner to the human designer.

The EA based optimal designs can start from the designer's existing design database or from an initial generation of candidate designs obtained randomly. A number of finally evolved top-performing candidates will represent several automatically optimized digital prototypes.

There are websites that demonstrate interactive evolutionary algorithms for design. [http://EndlessForms.com EndlessForms.com] allows you to evolve 3D objects online and have them 3D printed.  [http://www.picbreeder.org PicBreeder.org] allows you to do the same for 2D images.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16684">The '''conservation and restoration of Ancient Greek pottery''' is a sub-section of the broader topic of [[conservation and restoration of ceramic objects]]. [[Ancient Greek pottery]] is one of the most commonly found types of artifacts from the ancient Greek world. The information learned from vase paintings forms the foundation of modern knowledge of ancient Greek art and culture. Most ancient Greek pottery is [[terracotta]], a type of earthenware [[ceramic]], dating from the 11th century BCE through the 1st century CE. The objects are usually excavated from archaeological sites in broken pieces, or shards, and then reassembled. Some have been discovered intact in tombs. Professional [[conservator-restorer]]s, often in collaboration with [[curators]] and [[conservation scientist]]s, undertake the [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation-restoration]] of ancient Greek pottery.

== History of conservation and restoration approaches ==
=== Ancient ===
Ancient repairs were made to damaged pottery using metal pins or staples, which could be made of copper, lead, or bronze.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Animal or vegetable based adhesives may have also been used. Fragments from other vessels were sometimes used to replace damaged or missing sections of an object.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/&lt;/ref&gt; The decorative elements on the replacement pieces may or may not have matched the rest of the vase.

[[File:Greek - Black-figure Kylix with Sirens - Walters 4837 - Side B.jpg|thumb|Greek - Black-figure Kylix with Sirens - Walters 4837 - Side B. Several small holes around the handles were used for repairs in antiquity.]]

=== 18th to early 20th century ===
Restoration methods used during the 18th through early 20th century generally attempted to restore vessels to a near pristine state and hide any evidence of past damage.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological discoveries and a surge in the popularity of ancient Greek art in the 18th and 19th centuries created a high demand for objects and artifacts. The customary restoration method started with reassembling vessel fragments. Missing fragments were replaced with new glazed and fired pieces of pottery and gaps were filled in with plaster. The surface was then painted, sometimes extensively.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Materials used included [[shellac]], protein glues, oil paints, gypsum, plaster of Paris, barium sulphate, calcite, clay, kaolin, and waterglass (calcium silicate).&lt;ref&gt;Conservation Project: Greek Vases. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation/feature_greekvases&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, decorative imagery was censored and painted over, in order to appeal to the tastes of contemporary society and potential collectors.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern ===
The modern approach to conservation generally involves using non-destructive methods to evaluate objects and restoration techniques which emphasize the difference between areas of modern repair and ancient craftsmanship. Reversible adhesives, paint, and other materials are used in restorations.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation departments at museums such as the Getty Villa approach conservation of ancient pottery with the goal to "visually integrate filled areas and make them less obtrusive while still distinguishing them from the original ceramic and preserving an object's history."&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Approaches to Ceramic Conservation http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==
Most ancient Greek pottery is terracotta, a type of earthenware fired clay ceramic. The composition of minerals, metal, organic and other inorganic materials in the clay varies depending on its source. These variations impact the color of the clay before and after firing. Iron is the most common material found in clay, and can add red, grey, or buff coloring to the object.&lt;ref&gt;Care of Ceramics and Glass - Canadian Conservation Institute  http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170205&lt;/ref&gt; Pottery can be course wares, which are undecorated or only minimally decorated utilitarian vessels, or fine wares, which are decorated, finely potted, and used for a variety of purposes, including ceremonial use. Vase paintings were primarily created using slip, a thin, transparent layer of clay which turned color after firing. Other materials used in vase paintings include added pigment, added clay to create a relief on the surface, or dilute gloss that added color after firing.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, John H. The Greek Vase: Art of the Storyteller (London: British Museum, 2013), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Unevenly applied gloss or misfiring also created variations in color or surface texture. Gilding was also sometimes added after firing.

== Agents of deterioration ==
Ceramics, and ancient ceramics in particular, can suffer a variety of types of damage. Most agents of deterioration are due to environment and are inherent to the materials, however the most common damage is caused by human action.

=== Physical damage ===
Breaks, losses, or abrasions can be caused by improper handling, impact (dropping), or excavation. Ceramics are strong in compression, but weak under tension, meaning they are fragile and susceptible to mechanical shock.&lt;ref&gt;Buys, Susan and Victoria Oakley, Conservation and Restoration of Ceramics (Routledge, 2014), 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soluble salts ===
If a piece of pottery has been buried in salty or alkaline soil or submersed in seawater, the clay may have soaked up soluble salts, such as sulphite, nitrates, or chlorides. Changes in [[relative humidity]] can cause the salts to react and dissolve (in high humidity) or recrystallize (in low humidity).&lt;ref&gt;Care of Ceramics and Glass - Canadian Conservation Institute http://canada.pch.gc.ca/eng/1439925170205&lt;/ref&gt;  These reactions can cause pottery to suffer surface losses or delamination.&lt;ref&gt;Conservation Project: Greek Vases. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston http://www.mfa.org/collections/conservation/feature_greekvases&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Previous restorations ===
Previous restorations can cause unintended damage over time. Metal pins or staples can corrode and deteriorate. Plaster repairs may become unstable. In-painting may fade or discolor. Intentional over-painting from past conservation efforts is another form of damage. Scenes were sometimes altered in order to appeal to current tastes. A common example is a fig leaf being painted over a nude figure. Overly aggressive cleaning with acid can also cause damage. Acid cleaning is meant to remove insoluble salts and minerals from the surface of archaeological ceramics. Pottery that has been improperly cleaned and damaged by acid may have pitted, cracked, powdery, or flaking surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;National Park Service. "Long-term Effects of acid-cleaning on archaeological ceramics," Conserve-O-Gram (September 1999) https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/06-06.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preventative conservation ==
Preventative conservation measures can help slow further deterioration or damage.

=== Handling ===
As with any fragile ceramic object, proper handling techniques will help prevent accidental damage. Objects should be handled as little as possible. When handling is necessary, objects should be held at their strongest points only. Pressure on the weakest points, such as handles, necks, or areas with existing damage, should be avoided. Objects should be handled with clean, dry hands, or with nitrile gloves. Cotton gloves are not recommended, because the fabric prevents a stable grip and threads can snag on rough surfaces. Objects on display in museums are secured with mounts or protected by cases to prevent unwanted or accidental contact. Vessels may be displayed upright or at an angle, depending on the decorative elements on display. Any mounts should keep the object stable without putting pressure on any fragile areas.

=== Environmental conditions ===
Despite being dried and fired, pottery clay is still a porous material which will react to changes in environmental conditions. Avoiding extreme changes in temperature can help maintain the condition of ancient Greek pottery. As discussed above in the section on damage from Soluble Salts, preventing extreme fluctuations in relative humidity can also help prevent further deterioration. Objects should be protected from water and dirt.

== Examination ==
The following techniques are used by conservators to evaluate the condition of ancient Greek pottery and determine appropriate treatment. Examination is the first step in the conservation process.

=== Visual inspection ===
Conservators begin the evaluation of an object with careful visual inspection to identify areas of weakness, loss, delamination, discoloration, or old repairs. Further examination with a low power microscope can help conservators identify materials and technical features, such as pigment, gilding, or added clay.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ultraviolet (UV) visible fluorescence ===
When exposed to invisible [[UV light]], many types of materials will display certain colors of visible light. This can enable conservators to identify areas of different media throughout the object.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== X-radiography ===
X-rays can reveal breaks, internal features, or hidden ancient repairs, such as pins.&lt;ref&gt;Fragment to Vase: Examination Methods http://www.getty.edu/art/exhibitions/fragment_to_vase/examination_methods.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Another type of x-ray, called X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectroscopy can reveal the elemental and chemical composition of a material. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy can reveal the iron oxidation states in pottery (the factor that determines black and red color) and X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses can provide information on the molecular structure of iron minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham, Melissa. "Deciphering the Elements of Iconic Pottery," National Science Foundation (March 28, 2011) https://www.nsf.gov/mobile/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=119082&amp;org=NSF&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conservation treatment ==
After evaluation is completed, conservator-restorers can determine the most appropriate form of treatment. Treatments can range from non-invasive techniques, such as cleaning, to more invasive conservation such as disassembly, reconstruction, and restoration.

[[File:Ancient Greek pottery from Cyclades, shard with painting, 7th c BC, AM Paros, 143923.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek pottery from Cyclades, shard with painting, 7th c BC, AM Paros, 143923]]

=== Cleaning ===
Basic mechanical cleaning can remove dirt, dust, and grime. Cleaning solvents and water can also be used to remove dirt, varnish, wax, in-painting, or adhesives. Acids should be used with caution. [[Desalination]] is a cleaning method that removes as much soluble salt from the porous fired clay as possible. Fragments are soaked in highly purified water for multiple days. The water is changed regularly until salt levels are reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Usui, Emiko and Julia Gaviria, Eds., Conservation and Care of Museum Collections (Boston: Museum of Fine Arts, 2011), 152.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disassembly ===
For vessels that have been previously conserved and reassembled, shards may need to be disassembled in order to remove old restoration materials and complete conservation. Adhesives and fill are systematically removed, revealing the original pottery and allowing the vessel to be deconstructed.

=== Reconstruction and restoration ===
Separated shards are carefully reassembled. Conservators use identifying clues such as shape, texture, and decorative pattern or painted scenes to piece together fragments. Missing shards can be recreated out of plaster and replaced. In-painting is used to disguise areas of repair. In modern conservation treatment, the media used by conservators is reversible and can easily be distinguished from ancient material. Different conservators, or conservation departments, may have different policies regarding in-painting. Some conservators leave replacement fragments completely undecorated in order to easily distinguish them as modern additions. Some conservators paint silhouettes of missing figures, using existing fragments, scene narrative, and other extant vases as examples. This approach helps show the narrative of the painted scene, while still distinguishing the modern restoration from the original fragments. Some conservators use more extensive in-painting to recreate missing decoration.

== Notable examples ==
The Affecter Amphora, in the collection of the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, Maryland, is a case study for the history of conservation of Greek vases. The black figured Attic (meaning from Athens region) vessel was created around 540 BCE by a well documented vase painter known as the [[Affecter|Affecter Painter]]. Treatment of the vase in the 1980s provided the conservation field with significant insight into the history of the restoration of Greek vases. Conservators discovered that the amphora had been broken and repaired in antiquity. Samples of burial dirt found within holes in the vase proved that the repairs were made prior to the vase being used in an ancient funeral. Conservators also discovered that the vase was restored in the late19th century with materials and methods typical of the time period. Plaster, replacement pieces of terracotta, and extensive overpainting had been used in the restoration. Overpainting disguised repairs and also altered the appearance of nude satyrs on the decorative panels. The 1980s conservation revealed the original work of the Affecter Painter and restored the vase to a stable condition.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, Carol (1986). "The Affecter Amphora: A Case Study in the History of Greek Vase Restoration." The Journal of the Walters Art Gallery, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Attic Black-Figure Volute-Krater, known as the Francois vase, ca. 570-565 BCE.jpg|thumb|Attic Black-Figure Volute-Krater, known as the Francois vase, ca. 570-565 BCE]]

The [[Francois Vase]], in the collection of the National Archaeological Museum in Florence, Italy, is a large Attic volute krater, which is both a superb example of black-figure pottery from c. 570-560 BCE, as well as an example of extensive conservation work. The vase was discovered in a tomb in 1844. In the year 1900, a member of the museum staff smashed the display case and the vase shattered into over 600 pieces. It was restored by 1902, and then restored again in 1973, with previously missing pieces.

'''Drapery''' is a general word referring to [[cloth]]s or [[textile]]s ([[Old French]] ''[[wikt:draperie|draperie]]'', from [[Late Latin]] ''drappus''&lt;ref&gt;"Perhaps of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] origin" ''[[OED]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;).  It may refer to cloth used for decorative purposes &amp;ndash; such as around windows &amp;ndash; or to the trade of retailing cloth, originally mostly for clothing, formerly conducted by drapers. 

In [[art history]], drapery refers to any cloth or textile depicted, which is usually clothing. The schematic depiction of the folds and woven patterns of loose-hanging clothing on the human form, with ancient prototypes, was reimagined as an adjunct to the female form by Greek vase-painters and sculptors of the earliest fifth century and has remained a major source of stylistic formulas in sculpture and painting, even after the [[Renaissance]] adoption of tighter-fitting clothing styles.  After the Renaissance, large cloths with no very obvious purpose are often used decoratively, especially in portraits in the [[grand manner]]; these are also known as draperies.
[[Image:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|280px|Fresco of [[Mithras]] and the Bull from the [[mithraeum]] at Marino, (3rd century CE)]]
For the Greeks, as [[Sir Kenneth Clark]] noted,&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''The Young Johneey: A Study in Ideal Form'' 1956:245ff.&lt;/ref&gt; clinging drapery followed the planes and contours of the bodily form, emphasizing its twist and stretch: "floating drapery makes visible the line of movement through which it has just passed.... Drapery, by suggesting lines of force, indicates for each action a past and a possible future." Clark contrasted the formalized draperies in the frieze at Olympia with the sculptural frieze figures of the [[Parthenon]], where "it has attained a freedom and an expressive power that have never been equalled except by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]". Undraped male figures, Clark observed, "were kept in motion by their flying cloaks."

The '''East Village''' is a neighborhood in the New York City [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]]. It is roughly defined as the neighborhood east of the [[Bowery]] and [[Third Avenue]], between [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] on the north and [[Houston Street (Manhattan)|Houston Street]] on the south.&lt;ref name=EV&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CEFD6123FF932A35752C0A963958260 F.Y.I.], "When did the East Village become the East Village and stop being part of the Lower East Side?", Jesse McKinley, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 1, 1995; accessed August 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The area was once generally considered to be part of the [[Lower East Side]] with a large Russian, Ukrainian and Jewish population but gradually changed and by the late 1960s, many artists, musicians, students and [[hippie]]s began to move into the area, attracted by cheap rents and the base of [[Beatniks]] who had lived there since the 1950s. The neighborhood has become a center of the [[counterculture]] in New York, and is known as the birthplace and historical home of many artistic movements, including [[punk rock]]&lt;ref name=TimesPunk&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE3DF1231F93BA35755C0A966958260 In Rocking East Village, The Beat Never Stops], Karen Schoemer, ''The New York Times'', June 8, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nuyorican]] literary movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nylatinojournal.com/home/news/latest/another_nuyorican_icon_fades_2.html Another Nuyorican Icon Fades] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027010459/http://nylatinojournal.com/home/news/latest/another_nuyorican_icon_fades_2.html |date=October 27, 2007 }}, Santiago Nieves, ''New York Latino Journal'', May 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been the site of protests and riots.

East Village is still known for its diverse community, vibrant nightlife and artistic sensibility, although in recent decades it has been argued that [[gentrification]] has changed the character of the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=Kugel&gt;Kugel, Seth, [http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/09/16/travel/16weekend.html?8dpc=&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1190248668-ACLJp7B7rjG4VBXM9IgjGg "An 80-Block Slice of City Life"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Early development ===
[[Image:Little Germany House.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Former German-American Shooting Society Clubhouse at 12 [[8th Street / St. Mark's Place (Manhattan)|St Mark's Place]] (1885). East Village once had a sizable [[Little Germany, Manhattan|Little Germany]], an area within which this building is located.]]

The area that is today known as the East Village was originally a farm owned by Dutch Governor-General [[Wouter van Twiller]]. [[Peter Stuyvesant]] received the deed to this farm in 1651, and his family held on to the land for over seven generations, until a descendant began selling off parcels of the property in the early 19th century. Wealthy townhouses dotted the dirt roads for a few decades until the great Irish and German immigration of the 1840s and 1850s.

[[Land speculation|Speculative land owners]] began building multi-unit dwellings on lots meant for [[single family homes]], and began renting out rooms and apartments to the growing working class, including many immigrants from Germany. From roughly the 1850s to first decade of the 20th century, the neighborhood has the third largest urban population of Germans outside of [[Vienna]] and Berlin, known as ''Klein Deutschland'' ("[[Little Germany, Manhattan|Little Germany]]"). It was America's first foreign language neighborhood; hundreds of political, social, sports and recreational clubs were set up during this period, and some of these buildings still exist. However, the vitality of the community was sapped by the [[SS General Slocum|General Slocum]] disaster on June 15, 1904, in which over a thousand German-Americans died.

Later waves of immigration also brought many [[Poles]] and, especially, [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainians]] to the area, creating a [[Ukrainian Americans in New York City|Ukrainian enclave]] in the city. Since the 1890s there has been a large concentration roughly from 10th Street to 5th Street, between 3rd Avenue and Avenue A. The post-World War II [[Ukrainian diaspora|diaspora]], consisting primarily of Western Ukrainian ''intelligentsia'', also settled down in the area. Several churches, including [[St. George's Church (New York City)|St. George's Catholic Church]]; Ukrainian restaurants and butcher shops; [[The Ukrainian Museum]]; the [[Shevchenko Scientific Society]]; and the Ukrainian Cultural Center are evidence of the impact of this culture on the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title="East Village Afternoon" exhibit highlights Ukrainian presence in NYC|journal=The Ukrainian Weekly|date=December 14, 2008|volume=50|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area originally ended at the [[East River]], to the east of where [[Avenue D (Manhattan)|Avenue D]] is now located, until landfill – including World War II debris and rubble shipped from London – was used to extend the shoreline outward to provide foundation for the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/14/arts/14expl.html Paths of Resistance in the East Village], John Strausbaugh, ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 14, 2007; accessed August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New neighborhood ===
[[File:East Village, New York City, 1998.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A wall in the East Village in 1998, featuring a mural of two men]]

Until the mid-1960s, the area was simply the northern part of the Lower East Side, with a similar culture of immigrant, working class life. In the 1950s, the migration of [[Beatnik]]s into the neighborhood later attracted hippies, musicians and artists well into the 1960s.&lt;ref name=EV/&gt; The area was dubbed the "East Village", to dissociate it from the image of slums evoked by the Lower East Side. According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', a 1964 guide called ''Earl Wilson's New York'' wrote that "artists, poets and promoters of coffeehouses from Greenwich Village are trying to remelt the neighborhood under the high-sounding name of 'East Village.'"&lt;ref name=EV/&gt;

Newcomers and real estate brokers popularized the new name, and the term was adopted by the popular media by the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/sles/sles-maps.html |title=Selling the Lower East Side – Geography Page |accessdate=January 17, 2007 |last=Mele |first=Christopher |author2=Kurt Reymers |author3=Daniel Webb |work=Selling the Lower East Side |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619111123/http://upress.umn.edu/sles/sles-maps.html |archivedate=June 19, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.upress.umn.edu/sles/chapter5/ch5-1.html| title = The 1960s Counterculture and the Invention of the "East Village"| accessdate = January 17, 2007| last = Mele| first = Christopher| author2 = Kurt Reymers| author3 = Daniel Webb| work = Selling the Lower East Side| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110514031701/http://www.upress.umn.edu/sles/Chapter5/ch5-1.html| archivedate = May 14, 2011| df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966 a weekly newspaper, ''[[The East Village Other]]'', appeared and ''The New York Times'' declared that the neighborhood "had come to be known" as the East Village in the edition of June 5, 1967.&lt;ref name=EV/&gt;

===Arts scenes===

==== Music scene ====
[[File:Patti Smith Copenhagen 1976.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Patti Smith]], seen here in [[Copenhagen]] in 1976, is one of the many poets, musicians and artists who got their start in the East Village&lt;ref&gt;Otis, Ginger Adam; Greenfield, Beth; Reid, Robert; and St. Louis. ''Lonely Planet New York City City Guide'' (6th ed.) Lonely Planet, 2008, {{ISBN|978-1-74104-889-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In 1966, [[Andy Warhol]] promoted a series of [[multimedia]] shows, entitled "The Exploding Plastic Inevitable", and featuring the music of the [[Velvet Underground]], in a Polish ballroom on [[St. Marks Place (Manhattan)|St. Marks Place]]. On June 27, 1967, the [[Electric Circus (nightclub)|Electric Circus]] opened in the same space with a benefit for the Children's Recreation Foundation whose chairman was [[Robert F. Kennedy|Bobby Kennedy]]. [[The Grateful Dead]], [[The Chambers Brothers]], [[Sly and the Family Stone]], and [[the Allman Brothers Band]] were among the many [[Rock music|rock bands]] that performed there before it closed in 1971.

On March 8, 1968, [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] opened the [[Fillmore East]] in what had been a [[Yiddish Theatre]] on [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]] at [[6th Street (Manhattan)|East 6th Street]] in the [[Yiddish Theater District]]. The venue quickly became known as "The Church of Rock and Roll", with two-show concerts several nights a week. While booking many of the same bands that had played the Electric Circus, Graham particularly used the venue, as well as its West Coast counterpart, to establish in the US British bands such as [[The Who]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]], [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Led Zeppelin]]. The Fillmore East closed in 1971.

[[CBGB]], the nightclub considered by some to be the birthplace of [[punk music]], was located in the neighborhood, as was the early punk standby [[A7 (bar)|A7]]. [[No Wave]] and [[New York hardcore]] also emerged in the area's clubs. Among the many important bands and singers who got their start at these clubs and other venues in downtown Manhattan were [[Patti Smith]], [[Arto Lindsay]], the [[Ramones]], [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]], [[Richard Hell and the Voidoids]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Talking Heads]], [[Television (band)|Television]], the [[Plasmatics]], [[Glenn Danzig]], [[Sonic Youth]], the [[Beastie Boys]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], and [[The Strokes]].

Few icons of the punk scene remain in the neighborhood as it changed. [[Richard Hell]] lives in the same apartment he has lived in since the 1970s, and [[Handsome Dick Manitoba]] of [[The Dictators]] owns Manitoba's bar on [[Avenue B (Manhattan)|Avenue B]].

==== Art scene ====

Over the last 100 years, the East Village and the Lower East Side have contributed significantly to American arts and culture in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carlo McCormick]], "The Downtown Book: The New York Art Scene, 1974–1984", Princeton University Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The neighborhood has been the birthplace of cultural icons and movements from the American gangster to the [[Warhol Superstar]]s, [[folk music]] to [[punk rock]], [[anti-folk]] to [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], advanced education to organized [[activism]], [[experimental theater]] to the [[Beat Generation]] and the community of experimental musicians, composers and improvisers now loosely known as the Downtown Scene.

[[Club 57]], on St. Marks Place, was an important incubator for [[performance art]] and visual art in the late 1970s and early 1980s; followed by [[Now Gallery]], 8BC and [[ABC No Rio]].

During the 1980s, the East Village art gallery scene helped to galvanize a new [[post-modern]] art in America; showing such artists as [[Kiki Smith]], [[Peter Halley]], [[Keith Haring]], [[Kenny Scharf]], [[Stephen Lack]], [[Greer Lankton]], [[Joseph Nechvatal]], [[Jim Radakovich]], [[Nan Goldin]], [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]], [[David Wojnarowicz]], [[James Romberger]], [[Jeff Koons]], [[Kevin Larmee]], and Dave Vulcan.

The East Village, specifically the area known as [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]], is also the setting for [[Jonathan Larson]]'s musical ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'', which captures the neighborhood in the early 1990s; it opened at the [[New York Theatre Workshop]] in February 1996.&lt;ref name=Perez&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/13/nyregion/thecity/13rent.html From Grit to Gloss], Richard Perez, ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 13, 2005; access August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rent'' describes a city devastated by the [[AIDS epidemic]], drugs and high crime, and follows several characters in their efforts to make livings as artists.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/nyregion/thecity/13rent.html?_r=1&amp;ref=thecity&amp;oref=slogin Bohemia Takes its Final Bow], Campbell Robertson, ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 18, 2008; accessed August 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Rent; A Spell for Alphabet City|url=http://www.lifecafenyc.com/ls_press.html|accessdate=March 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Decline ====
The East Village's performance and art scene has declined since its height in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Haber, John.

=== Gentrification and preservation ===

====Gentrification and effects====
As has often been the pattern in Manhattan, a neighborhood that is "discovered" by artists and [[Bohemianism|bohemians]] and then becomes "hip" will often begin to attract more affluent residents, which drives up the price of housing, and begins to drive out the residents who "turned over" the neighborhood. This is one theory of [[gentrification]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy and Leonard|first=Maureen and Paul|title=Dealing with Neighborhood Change: A Primer on Gentrification and Policy Choices|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/reports/2001/04/metropolitanpolicy|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some argue that it has also occurred in the New York City neighborhoods [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] and [[Tribeca]] in [[Manhattan]], as well as [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] in [[Brooklyn]]. Over the course of time, this demographic shift begins to change the essential character of the neighborhood: it becomes safer, more comfortable, less tolerant of noise, and less "edgy". Some gentrification opponents{{who|date=December 2015}} say that this process causes the neighborhood to lose its unique identity for the sake of money.&lt;ref&gt;Mathis-Lilley, Ben, "The Neighborhood News", ''New York Magazine'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "gentrification" is often used to reflect this,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gebhardt|first=Sara|title=Living with the Tensions of Gentrification|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/11/AR2005111100820.html?nav=rss_opinion/columns|accessdate=March 5, 2013|work=The Washington Post|date=November 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the gentrification of the neighborhood has resulted in people being pushed out and some buildings in the area being torn down and replaced by newer buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jeremiah Budin |url=http://ny.curbed.com/archives/2014/03/25/look_at_these_nyc_storefronts_pre_and_postgentrification.php |title=Look At These NYC Storefronts Pre- and Post-Gentrification – East Village Gentrification – Curbed NY |publisher=Ny.curbed.com |date=March 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, actor [[David Schwimmer]] bought an 1852 townhouse on East 6th Street in 2010 and got several notices of its possible landmark status the next year; however, he had the building torn down and rebuilt, which angered some of his neighbors.&lt;ref name=post/&gt;

====Rezoning====
[[File:1st Avenue 9171.JPG|thumb|left|250px|[[1st Avenue (Manhattan)|1st Avenue]], looking north at 10th Street]]
In 2008 a rezoning modified much of the zoning in East Village. The area affected by the rezoning roughly bounded by East 13th Street on the north, Third Avenue on the west, Delancey Street on the south, and Avenue D on the east.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/evles/zoning_proposed.pdf Map of approved zoning changes from New York City Department of City Planning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304131421/http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/pdf/evles/zoning_proposed.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/evles/evles3.shtml|title=New York City Department of City Planning, East Village / Lower East Side Rezoning}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time that a rezoning had occurred in the area since 1961.

The rezoning was done in response to concerns about the character and scale of some of the new buildings in the neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/nyregion/15zoning.html?scp=2&amp;sq=east%20village%20rezoning&amp;st=cse|title=High-Rises Are at Heart of Manhattan Zoning Battle | work=The New York Times | first=Christine | last=Haughney | date=November 15, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous zoning limited the area of floor space that a building could have, but there were no limits on building heights or on setbacks from the street. The new zoning established height limits for new development throughout the affected area, decreased allowable density in much of the midblock residential areas but increased it along wider thoroughfares, capped air rights transfers, eliminated the current zoning bonus for dorms and hotels, and created incentives for the creation and retention of affordable housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Village Rezoning|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/ev_rezoning/ev_rezoning_main.htm|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city first released a draft rezoning in July 2006, after hearing input from neighborhood advocates including the [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] (GVSHP), [[Community Boards of Manhattan|Community Board 3]], the East Village Community Coalition, and City Councilmember [[Rosie Mendez]]. Concerned that the Third Avenue corridor, where much of the most out-of-scale development was occurring, was left out of that draft, advocates continued to push for an expansion of the rezoning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter Regarding East Village Rezoning, Nov. 2006|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/ev_rezoning/doc/dcp-11-03-06.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=August 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually securing the 3rd/4th Avenue Corridor Downzoning in 2010. The GVSHP report "Keeping in Character" summed up the changes this way:
{{quote|"Under the new zoning, development tends to be shorter and much more similar in height to surrounding buildings, must maintain the all-important street wall, is usually less bulky than could have been built under the old zoning, and is more likely to be for residential use than a hotel or dormitory.

"In fact, in many cases the new zoning makes it more desirable to retain existing buildings rather than tear them down and replace them as the old zoning had encouraged. The rezoning does contain some zoning bulk bonuses for the creation or retention of affordable housing. But even in these cases the new developments are nevertheless required to maintain the same height limits as all other new developments in their zoning district."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keeping in Character|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/east_village/doc/keeping-in-character.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The rezoning process and hearings were marked by protests and accusations of promoting [[gentrification]] and increased property values over the [[Lower East Side]]'s historic status as a home to New York's low-income immigrant communities and their needs for affordable housing. Residents of [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], which is adjacent to the southern boundary of the rezoning area, were worried that by blocking the construction of tall, slender towers in the East Village, developers wishing to build in that style would turn their sights to Chinatown. Most of Chinatown is zoned as commercial districts, which are relatively lax in terms of building character and land use regulations. This led the [[Community Boards of New York City|Community Boards]] in the area (Boards [[Manhattan Community Board 1|1]], [[Manhattan Community Board 2|2]], and [[Manhattan Community Board 3|3]]) to create the Chinatown Working Group in order to address the concerns of residents and to work to preserve Chinatown's particular character, employment opportunities, and affordable housing.

====Landmark efforts====

=====Successes=====
[[File:Extra Place from 1st Street.jpg|thumb|left|200px|"Extra Place", an obscure side street off of East 1st Street, just east of the Bowery]]
Local community groups actively are working to gain individual and district landmark designations for the East Village to preserve and protect the architectural and cultural identity of the neighborhood. One such group is the [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] (GVSHP). It has undertaken a complete survey of the East Village, documenting the history of every single building in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/east_village/east_village-main.htm "East Village"] on the [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] website&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 2011, the [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] (LPC) proposed two East Village historic districts: one small district covering the block of East 10th Street known as [[Tompkins Square]] North, and one larger district focused around lower Second Avenue that would encompass 15 blocks and 330 buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/east_village/east_village-main.htm "East Village Preservation"] on the [[Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation]] website&lt;/ref&gt; The original proposal for the larger district excluded buildings such as the [[Pyramid Club (New York)|Pyramid Club]] and the Russian Orthodox Cathedral on East 2nd Street. As a result of the efforts made by local community groups such as GVSHP, the Lower East Side Preservation Initiative, East Village Community Coalition, and [[Historic Districts Council]], however, the proposed district now includes these buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thevillager.com/villager_426/pyramid.html "Editing the East Village"] on the [[The Villager (Manhattan)|Villager]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2012, the East 10th Street Historic District was designated by the LPC. Minutes before the designation, an out-of-scale rooftop addition on one of the included buildings was approved by the Department of Buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/designation-of-historic-district-in-east-village-wont-stop-project/ "Designation of Historic District in East Village Won’t Stop Project"] on ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}} website&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 the [[East Village/Lower East Side Historic District]] – the larger district – was also designated by the LPC. Preservation and community groups of the East Village seek to have other buildings landmarked, including parts of St. Mark's Place, the blocks to the north, and more of the streets bordering Tompkins Square Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2012/10/10/next-up-a-tompkins-square-historic-district/ "Next Up: A Tompkins Square Historic District?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Other successful efforts to retain the neighborhood's low-rise character by controlling development include the East Village downzoning of 2008 and the 3rd/4th Avenue Corridor downzoning, effective in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Village Rezoning|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/ev_rezoning/ev_rezoning_main.htm|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GVSHP and allied groups have rallied to get some notable buildings designated as individual landmarks, while other structures have been demolished over community objections. Individual landmarks include [[Webster Hall]], a Romanesque Revival concert hall and nightclub designed in 1886 with an "extraordinary cultural history." According to GVSHP's 2007 request for evaluation for the building, "Over the last 120 years, the space has hosted everything from debutante balls and society dinners to wrestling matches, political rallies, union meetings, and bohemian costume dances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Webster Hall LPC submission|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/webster_hall/doc/WebsterHallLPCSubmission.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than one year later, in 2007, the building was designated an individual landmark. A year earlier, the LPC designated P.S. 64, a French Renaissance Revival public school built in 1904-6 by architect and school superintendent [[C.B.J. Snyder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LPC Designation Report: Former P.S. 64|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/lpc/downloads/pdf/reports/ps64.pdf|publisher=NYC Landmarks Preservation Commission|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters hoped the 2006 vote would serve the practical purpose of ending the owner's removal of architectural details; it was but one chapter in a heated, ongoing controversy over the building, which had been used as the CHARAS/El Bohio community center until New York City sold it to developer Gregg Singer. The year 2006 also saw GVSHP call for the Landmarks Preservation Commission to prevent the demolition of  the former [[Van Tassell and Kearney Horse Auction Mart]], a building described as both stately and humble, built for horse trade but eventually used as a factory for "Rosie the Riveter"-type women working during World War II, then a studio of the major abstract expressionist [[Frank Stella]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Testimony Regarding Former Van Tassel and Kearney Horse Mart|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/stella_stable/doc/lpctst13street.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission did so by calendaring the building, and designated it a New York City landmark in 2012.

Other individual landmarks in the neighborhood include the former Yiddish Art Theater, now in use as a movie theater, which also is an interior landmark (a relatively rare distinction), designated in 1993; the Stuyvesant Polyclinic, built in 1884 and designated in 1976; the Children's Aid Society's Elizabeth Home for Girls, designated in 2008; and the First Houses, the country's first public housing development, built in 1935, designated in 1974, and still used as low-income housing today.

Landmark efforts have included a number of losses as well. Despite the request of GVSHP and allied groups in 2012 for landmarking of Mary Help of Christians school, church and rectory, with parts dating to 1850 and designed by Nicholas Serracino, by July 2013 demolition had begun. A new development including residences and ground-floor retail is slated to fill the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two Steps Forward, One Step Back|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/east_village/ev-07-31-13.htm|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, an early 19th-century Federal house at 35 Cooper Square — one of the oldest on the Bowery and in the East Village — was demolished to make way for a college dorm, over requests of community groups and elected officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=35 Cooper Square/Bowery Alliance of Neighbors|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/east_village/doc/ltr-lpc-ban-11-12-10.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Landmarks Preservation Commission]] acts on no particular schedule, leaving some "calendared" requests for designation open indefinitely, such as the 1886 Tifereth Israel synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will 'One of the Most Important Buildings in the East Village' Become a Landmark?|url=http://gvshp.org/blog/2014/02/05/will-one-of-the-most-important-buildings-in-the-east-village-become-a-landmark/|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it simply declines requests for consideration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Request for Evaluation of 143 E. 13th Street, Manhattan|url=http://www.gvshp.org/_gvshp/preservation/east_village/doc/143-e13th-st-rfe.pdf|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=August 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it did regarding an unusually intact Italianate tenement at 143 E. 13th Street.

Along with gentrification, the East Village has seen an increase in the number of buildings owned and maintained by [[New York University]], particularly dormitories for undergraduate students, and this influx has given rise to conflict between the community and the university.&lt;ref name=Voice&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0610,lombardi,72426,2.html As NYU plans towering dorm for 12th Street, East Village neighbors cry foul], Kristen Lombardi, ''The Village Voice'', February 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]], comprising nearly two-thirds of the East Village, was once the archetype of a dangerous New York City neighborhood.

[[Loisaida]] is a term derived from the [[Latino]], and especially [[Nuyorican]], pronunciation of "[[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]]". The term was originally coined by poet/activist, [[Bittman "Bimbo" Rivas]] in his 1974 poem "Loisaida". Loisaida Avenue is now an alternative name for Avenue C in the [[Alphabet City, Manhattan|Alphabet City]] neighborhood of New York City, whose population has largely been [[Hispanic]] (mainly [[Nuyorican]]) since the late 1960s. During the 1980s many of the old, vacant, tenement buildings in this area became inhabited by squatters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schulz|first=Dana|title=Umbrella, Umbrella|url=http://gvshp.org/blog/2011/06/14/umbrella-umbrella/|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bowery]], former home to the punk-rock nightclub [[CBGB]] that closed in 2006, was once known for its many homeless shelters, drug rehabilitation centers and bars. The phrase "On the Bowery", which has since fallen into disuse, was a generic way to say one was down-and-out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyfolklore.org/pubs/voic29-3-4/dnstate.html On the Bowery], Steve Zeitlin and Marci Reaven, New York Folklore Society's journal ''Voices'', Vol. 29, Fall-Winter, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ukrainian Americans in New York City#Little Ukraine|Little Ukraine]] is an [[ethnic enclave]] in the East Village, which has served as a spiritual, political and cultural epicenter for several waves of [[Ukrainian Americans]] in New York City as far back as the late 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century, Ukrainian immigrants began moving into areas previously dominated by fellow [[Eastern European]] and [[Galician Jews]], as well as the Lower East Side's [[Little Germany, Manhattan|German enclave]]. After [[World War II]], the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] population of the neighborhood reached 60,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/16/nyregion/neighborhood-report-east-harlem-ukrainian-accent-gets-stronger.html | title=Ukrainian Accent Gets Stronger | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=16 November 1997 | author=McKinley, Jesse}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as with the city's [[Little Italy, Manhattan|Little Italy]], today the neighborhood consists of only a few Ukrainian stores and restaurants.

Little Ukraine itself is traditionally defined as
* East 7th Street, between [[Third Avenue]] and [[Avenue A (Manhattan)|Avenue A]];
* East 6th Street, between Third Avenue and [[Second Avenue (Manhattan)|Second Avenue]];
* Second Avenue, between East [[14th Street (Manhattan)|14th Street]] and East 4th Street;
* [[Taras Shevchenko Place]]

As it did a century ago, [[St. George's Church (Manhattan)|St. George Ukrainian Catholic Church]] serves as the anchor of Little Ukraine, offering daily liturgies and penances, and operating the adjoining [[St. George Academy]], a [[Mixed-sex education|coeducational]] [[parochial school]]. Since 1976, the church has sponsored an annual Ukrainian Heritage Festival, regularly described as one of the few remaining authentic New York City street fairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iCLSJlGfRBMC&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;ots=e11y1KHJkX&amp;dq=ed%20koch%20Ukrainian%20festival%20mayor%20new%20york&amp;pg=PA90#v=onepage&amp;q=ed%20koch%20Ukrainian%20festival%20mayor%20new%20york&amp;f=false | title=The Suburbanization of New York: Is the World's Greatest City Becoming Just Another Town | publisher=Princeton Architectural Press | author=Wasserman, Suzanne | year=2007 | location=New York | pages=90 | isbn=978-1568986784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Communist Rally, 1877 ====
In July 1877, railroad workers received their second wage cut of the year by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad. On July 14, railroad employees in Martinsburg, West Virginia, began what came to be known as the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]]. On July 25, 1877, twenty thousand people gathered in [[Tompkins Square Park]] to hear communist orators speak about revolution, the strike, and the policies of President Hayes. All speeches were repeated in German at a second stand, as the neighborhood had such a large German population at that time. David Conroy, Chairman of the Working Man's Organization in NYC and organizer of the rally, stated that the purpose of the meeting was to harmonize the differences between the strikers and the railroad companies, and to urge the citizen soldiery to refrain from acting against the strikers. Although the rally did not get out of hand, New York City police and National Guardsmen eventually charged the crowd with billy clubs, later claiming that the rally was not being held in a peaceful manner. In the wake of this "riot," the City, in conjunction with the War Department, established an official city armory program led by the 7th Regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schulz|first=Dana|title=On This Day: The Tompkins Square Park Communist Rally|url=http://gvshp.org/blog/2011/07/25/on-this-day-the-tompkins-square-communist-rally/|publisher=Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation|accessdate=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Roman Catholic churches in the East Village have fallen victim to financial hardship in the last decade. Unable or unwilling to maintain them, the Roman Catholic Church has shuttered St. Mary's Help of Christians on East 12th Street, as well as St. Ann's. There has recently been much controversy over [[Saint Brigid's Roman Catholic Church, New York|St. Brigid's]], the historic parish on [[Tompkins Square Park]]. One of the mainstays that remains active is St. Stanislaus, just steps from Tompkins Square Park.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

'''''Famine-33''''' ({{lang-ua|Голод-33}}, ''Holod-33'') is a 1991 [[drama film]] by Oles Yanchuk about the [[Holodomor]] famine in [[Ukraine]], and based on the novel ''The Yellow Prince'' by [[Vasyl Barka]]. The film is told through the lives of the Katrannyk family of six.

==Synopsis==
"In an early scene, the members of an impoverished farming family solemnly take turns dipping their ladles into the single bowl of watery soup that is their only meal of the day. Later in the film, scores of villagers numb with despair and hunger huddle silently in the pouring rain outside a Government office until a truckload of armed soldiers arrives to disperse them. In the most poignant scene, a little boy who has lost his parents calls for his mother as he wanders, panic-stricken, through a snowy woodland where the trees are outnumbered by crosses marking the dead."&lt;ref&gt;Holden, Stephen. "A Family's Struggle In Stalin's Man-Made Famine: Famine-33 Film Review." ''The New York Times.'' 15 December 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2786">'''Global Release Day''' (alternatively known as '''New Music Fridays''') is a new set international day for releasing of music singles and albums. The new global release day went into effect on 10 July 2015 in more than 45 major recorded music markets worldwide with new music being released on a [[Friday]] as part of 'New Music Fridays'. 

The official announcement was made on 11 June 2015 by [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), which represents the worldwide recording industry.&lt;ref name=billboard&gt;Smirke, Richard. [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6591060/global-release-day-launch-set-for-july "Global Release Day Launch Set for July"], ''Billboard'' magazine, June 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The move means that new music will be available on the same day worldwide rather than on varying national release days, being Mondays for releases in France and the United Kingdom, Tuesdays in United States and Canada and Fridays, for example in Germany and Australia.

Music releases are now uniformly available around the world on Fridays at 00:01 local time in all 45 signatory countries. Of these, 11 countries had their release music on Fridays, while the remaining markets had to switch their day of release when the new albums and singles would become available. This move effectively ends the earlier phenomenon where new music was unavailable in one country when it was legally available elsewhere.&lt;ref name=charts&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/global-release-day-new-music-fridays-and-the-official-chart-to-kick-off-your-weekend-from-next-month__9801/|author=Rob Copsey|title=Global Release Day: New Music Fridays and The Official Chart to kick off your weekend from next month|publisher=The Official Charts|date=10 June 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in some countries, particularly in Asia, local music repertoire will still be released on different days. For instance, in Japan domestic acts will continue to release new music on Wednesdays, two days earlier than international repertoire.&lt;ref name=billboard/&gt;

The move has changed earlier traditional days where charts were being published as the official country charts try to adapt to the new "global day" for releases such that they capture a full week's sales and streaming from Friday mornings to Thursday nights. The UK Top 100, for example, published by [[Official Charts Company|The Official Charts]] moved from being published on a Sunday to a Friday with the [[BBC]] moving its new Top 40 charts program from Sundays at 4 p.m. local time to Fridays at 4 p.m. local time.

{{Japanese name|Hakuin}}
{{Nihongo|'''Hakuin Ekaku'''|白隠 慧鶴||extra=January 19, 1686 - January 18, 1768}} was one of the most influential figures in [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]] [[Buddhism]]. He is regarded as the reviver of the [[Rinzai school]] from a moribund period of stagnation, refocusing it on its traditionally rigorous training methods integrating [[meditation]] and [[koan]] practice.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Hakuin was born in 1686 in the small village of [[Hara-juku (Tōkaidō)|Hara]],&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://nippon-kichi.jp/article_list.do?ml_lang=en&amp;p=2082 Shoinji Temple]&lt;/ref&gt; at the foot of [[Mount Fuji]]. His mother was a devout [[Nichiren Buddhism|Nichiren Buddhist]], and it is likely that her piety was a major influence on his decision to become a Buddhist [[monk]]. As a child, Hakuin attended a lecture by a Nichiren monk on the topic of the [[Eight Hot Hells]]. This deeply impressed the young Hakuin, and he developed a pressing fear of [[hell]], seeking a way to escape it. He eventually came to the conclusion that it would be necessary to become a monk.

====Shōin-ji and Daishō-ji====
At the age of fifteen, he obtained consent from his parents to join the monastic life, and was ordained at the local Zen temple, [[Shōin-ji]]. When the head monk at Shōin-ji took ill, Hakuin was sent to a neighboring temple, Daishō-ji, where he served as a novice for three or four years, studying Buddhist texts. While at Daisho-ji, he read the [[Lotus Sutra]], considered by the Nichiren sect to be the king of all Buddhist sutras, and found it disappointing, saying "it consisted of nothing more than simple tales about [[causality|cause and effect]]".

====Zensō-ji====
At age eighteen, he left Daishō-ji for Zensō-ji, a temple close to Hara.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xv}} At the age of nineteen, he came across in his studies the story of the [[China|Chinese]] [[Ch'an]] master [[Yantou Quanhuo]], who had been brutally murdered by bandits. Hakuin despaired over this story, as it showed that even a great monk could not be saved from a bloody death in this life. How then could he, just a simple monk, hope to be saved from the tortures of hell in the next life? He gave up his goal of becoming an enlightened monk, and not wanting to return home in shame, traveled around studying literature and poetry.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xvi}}

====Zuiun-ji====
Travelling with twelve other monks, Hakuin made his way to Zuiun-ji, the residence of Baō Rōjin, a respected scholar but also a tough-minded teacher.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xvii}} While studying with the poet-monk Bao, he had an experience that put him back along the path of monasticism. He saw a number of books piled out in the temple courtyard, books from every school of Buddhism. Struck by the sight of all these volumes of literature, Hakuin prayed to the gods of the [[Dharma]] to help him choose a path. He then reached out and took a book; it was a collection of Zen stories from the [[Ming Dynasty]]. Inspired by this, he repented and dedicated himself to the practice of Zen.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xviii-xix}}

===First awakening===

====Eigen-ji====
He again went traveling for two years, settling down at the Eigen-ji temple when he was twenty-three. It was here that Hakuin had his first entrance into [[Kensho|enlightenment]] when he was twenty-four.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xvii}} He locked himself away in a shrine in the temple for seven days, and eventually reached an intense awakening upon hearing the ringing of the temple bell. However, his master refused to acknowledge this enlightenment, and Hakuin left the temple.
[[File:Hakuin.jpg|left|thumb|Hakuin Ekaku]]

====Shōju Rōjin====
Hakuin left again, to study for a mere eight months with Shōju Rōjin (Dokyu Etan, 1642–1721).{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxi-xxii}} Shoju was an intensely demanding teacher, who hurled insults and blows at Hakuin, in an attempt to free him from his limited understanding and self-centeredness. When asked why he had become a monk, Hakuin said that it was out of terror to fall into hell, to which Shōju replied "You're a self-centered rascal, aren't you!"{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii}} Shōju assigned him a series of "hard-to-pass" koans. These led to three isolated moments of [[satori]], but it was only eighteen years later that Hakuin really understood what Shōju meant with this.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii}}

Hakuin left Shoju after eight months of study,{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxii-xxiii}} without receiving formal dharma transmission from Shoju Rojin,{{sfn|Mohr|2003|p=311-312}} nor from any other teacher,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/blogs/monkeymind/2009/02/teaching-credentials-in-zen.html James Ford (2009), ''Teaching Credentials in Zen'']&lt;/ref&gt; but Hakuin considered himself to be an heir of Shoju Rojin. Today Hakuin is considered to have received [[dharma transmission]] from Shoju.&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.buddhapia.com/hmu/bcm/2/zen_soto_rinzai.html Zen Buddhism: from perspective of Japanese Soto &amp; Rinzai Zen Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717040105/http://www.buddhapia.com/hmu/bcm/2/zen_soto_rinzai.html |date=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Taigi'' - great doubt====
Hakuin realized that his attainment was incomplete.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxv}} He was unable to sustain the tranquility of mind of the Zen hall in the midst of daily life.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxv}} When he was twenty-six he read that "all wise men and eminent priests who lack the Bodhi-mind fall into Hell".{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}} This raised a "great doubt" (''taigi'') in him, since he thought that the formal entrance into monkhood and the daily enactment of rituals was the bodhi-mind.{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}} Only with his final awakening, at age 42, did he fully realize what "bodhi-mind" means, namely working for the good of others.{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=44}}

====Zen sickness====
Hakuin's early extreme exertions affected his health, and at one point in his young life he fell ill for almost two years, experiencing what would now probably be classified as a [[nervous breakdown]] by Western medicine. He called it [[Zen sickness]], and sought the advice of a [[Taoist]] cave dwelling hermit named Hakuyu, who prescribed a [[Mental image|visualization]] and breathing practice which eventually relieved his symptoms.  From this point on, Hakuin put a great deal of importance on physical strength and health in his Zen practice, and studying Hakuin-style Zen required a great deal of stamina. Hakuin often spoke of strengthening the body by concentrating the spirit, and followed this advice himself. Well into his seventies, he claimed to have more physical strength than he had at age thirty, being able to sit in zazen meditation or chant sutras for an entire day without fatigue.  The practices Hakuin learned from Hakuyu are still passed down within the Rinzai school.

===Head priest at Shōin-ji===
After another several years of travel, at age 31 Hakuin returned to Shoin-ji, the temple where he had been ordained. He was soon installed as head priest, a capacity in which he would serve for the next half-century. When he was installed as head priest of Shōin-ji in 1718, he had the title of ''Dai-ichiza'', "First Monk":{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxix}}
{{quote|It was the minimum rank required by government regulation for those installed as temple priests and seems to have been little more than a matter of paying a fee and registering Hakuin as the incumbent of Shōin-ji.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-a|p=xxix}}}}

It was around this time that he adopted the name "Hakuin", which means "concealed in white", referring to the state of being hidden in the clouds and snow of mount Fuji.{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=71}}

====Final awakening====
Although Hakuin had several "satori experiences", he did not feel free, and was unable to integrate his realization into his ordinary life.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}} At age 41, he experienced a final and total awakening, while reading the Lotus Sutra, the [[sutra]] that he had disregarded as a young student. He realized that the [[Bodhicitta|Bodhi-mind]] means working for the good of every sentient being:{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}}
{{quote|It was the chapter on parables, where the Buddha cautions his disciple Shariputra against savoring the joys of [[Pratyekabuddha|personal enlightenment]], and reveals to him the truth of the [[Bodhisattva]]'s mission, which is to continue practice beyond enlightenment, teaching and helping others until all beings have attained salvation.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}}}}

He wrote of this experience, saying "suddenly I penetrated to the perfect, true, ultimate meaning of the Lotus". This event marked a turning point in Hakuin's life. He dedicated the rest of his life to helping others achieve liberation.{{sfn|Waddell|2010-b|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Yoshizawa|2009|p=41}}

====Practicing the bodhi-mind====
He would spend the next forty years teaching at Shoin-ji, writing, and giving lectures. At first there were only a few monks there, but soon word spread, and Zen students began to come from all over the country to study with Hakuin. Eventually, an entire community of monks had built up in Hara and the surrounding areas, and Hakuin's students numbered in the hundreds. He eventually would certify over eighty disciples as successors.

====Is that so?====
A well-known anecdote took place in this period:
{{quote|A beautiful Japanese girl whose parents owned a food store lived near Hakuin. One day, without any warning, her parents discovered she was pregnant. This made her parents angry. She would not confess who the man was, but after much harassment at last named Hakuin.&lt;br&gt;
In great anger the parents went to the master. "Is that so?" was all he would say.&lt;br&gt;
After the child was born it was brought to Hakuin. By this time he had lost his reputation, which did not trouble him, but he took very good care of the child. He obtained milk from his neighbors and everything else the child needed by [[takuhatsu]].&lt;br&gt;
A year later the girl could stand it no longer. She told her parents the truth - the real father of the child was a young man who worked in the fish market.&lt;br&gt;
The mother and father of the girl at once went to Hakuin to ask forgiveness, to apologize at length, and to get the child back.&lt;br&gt;
Hakuin smiled and willingly yielded the child, saying: "Is that so? It's good to hear this baby has his/her father"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Reps|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcolnb|Kimihiko|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Death===
At the age of 83, Hakuin died in Hara, the same village in which he was born and which he had transformed into a center of Zen teaching.

===Post-satori practice===
[[Hakuin]] saw "deep compassion and commitment to help all sentient beings everywhere"{{sfn|Low|2006|p=35}} as an indispensable part of the [[Hakuin#Four ways of knowing|Buddhist path to awakening]]. Hakuin emphasized the need for "post-satori training",{{sfn|Waddell|2010}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}} purifying the mind of karmic tendencies and 
{{quote|[W]hipping forward the wheel of the Four Universal Vows, pledging yourself to benefit and save all sentient beings while striving every minute of your life to practice the great Dharma giving.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

The insight in the need of arousing [[bodhicitta]] formed Hakuin's final awakening:
{{quote|What is to be valued above all else is the practice that comes after satori is achieved. What is that practice? It is the practice that puts the [[Bodhicitta|Mind of Enlightenment]] first and foremost.&lt;br&gt;
[At] my forty-first year, [...] I at long last penetrated into the heart of this great matter. Suddenly, unexpectedly, I saw it — it was as clear as if it were right there in the hollow of my hand. What is the Mind of Enlightenment? It is, I realized, a matter of doing good — benefiting others by giving them the gift of the Dharma teaching.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}}}

===Koan practice===
Hakuin deeply believed that the most effective way for a student to achieve insight was through extensive [[meditation]] on a koan. Only with incessant investigation of his koan will a student be able to become one with the koan, and attain enlightenment. The psychological pressure and [[doubt]] that comes when one struggles with a koan is meant to create tension that leads to awakening. Hakuin called this the "great doubt", writing, "At the bottom of great doubt lies great awakening. If you doubt fully, you will awaken fully".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/40980460|title=Sculpture in the age of doubt|last=1939-2013,|first=McEvilley, Thomas,|isbn=9781581150230|location=New York|oclc=40980460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hakuin used a fivefold classification system:{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148}}&lt;br&gt;
1. ''Hosshin'', dharma-body koans, are used to awaken the first insight into [[sunyata]].{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148}} They reveal the [[dharmakaya]], or Fundamental.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=136}} They introduce "the undifferentiated and the unconditional".{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=136-137}}&lt;br&gt;
2. ''Kikan'', dynamic action koans, help to understand the phenomenal world as seen from the awakened point of view;{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=148-149}} Where ''hosshin'' koans represent ''tai'', substance, ''kikan'' koans represent ''yu'', function.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=137}}&lt;br&gt;
3. ''Gonsen'', explication of word koans, aid to the understanding of the recorded sayings of the old masters.{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=149}} They show how the Fundamental, though not depending on words, is nevertheless expressed in words, without getting stuck to words.{{clarify|date=August 2014}}{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=138}}&lt;br&gt;
4. ''Hachi Nanto'', eight "difficult to pass" koans.{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=135}} There are various explanations for this category, one being that these koans cut off clinging to the previous attainment. They create another Great Doubt, which shatters the self attained through ''satori''. {{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=139}} It is uncertain which are exactly those eight koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23}} Hori gives various sources, which altogether give ten ''hachi nanto'' koans.{{sfn|Hori|2003|p=23-24}}&lt;br&gt;
5.  ''Goi jujukin'' koans, the [[Five Ranks|Five Ranks of Tozan]] and the Ten Grave Precepts.{{sfn|Besserman|2011|p=151}}{{sfn|Hori|2005-B|p=135}}

Hakuin's emphasis on koan practice had a strong influence in the Japanese Rinzai-school. In the system developed by his followers, students are assigned koans by their teacher and then meditate on them. Once they have broken through, they must demonstrate their insight in private interview with the teacher.  If the teacher feels the student has indeed attained a satisfactory insight into the koan, then another is assigned. Hakuin's main role in the development of this koan system was most likely the selection and creation of koans to be used. In this he didn't limit himself to the classic koan collections inherited from China; he himself originated one of the best-known koans, "You know the sound of two hands clapping; tell me, what is the sound of one hand?".  Hakuin preferred this new koan to the most commonly assigned first koan from the Chinese tradition, the [[Mu (Japanese word)|Mu]] koan. He believed his "Sound of One Hand" to be more effective in generating the great doubt, and remarked that "its superiority to the former methods is like the difference between cloud and mud".

===Four ways of knowing===
{{See also|Huayan school#Four Dharmadhatu|l1=Four Dharmadhatu|Five wisdoms}}

Asanga, one of the main proponents of [[Yogacara]], introduced the idea of four ways of knowing: the perfection of action, observing knowing, universal knowing, and great mirror knowing. He relates these to the [[Eight Consciousnesses]]: 
# The five senses are connected to the perfection of action,
# Samjna (cognition) is connected to observing knowing,
# Manas (mind) is related to universal knowing,
# Alaya-vijnana is connected to great mirror knowing.{{sfn|Low|2006|p=22}}
In time, these ways of knowing were also connected to the doctrine of the [[Trikaya|three bodies of the Buddha]] ([[Dharmakāya]], [[Sambhogakāya]] and Nirmanakaya), together forming the "Yuishiki doctrine".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=22}}

Hakuin related these four ways of knowing to four gates on the Buddhist path: the Gate of Inspiration, the Gate of Practice, the Gate of Awakening, and the Gate of Nirvana.{{sfn|Low|2006|p=32-39}}
# The Gate of Inspiration is initial awakening, [[kensho]], seeing into one's true nature.
# The Gate of Practice is the purification of oneself by continuous practice.
# The Gate of Awakening is the study of the ancient masters and the Buddhist sutras, to deepen the insight into the Buddhist teachings, and acquire the skills needed to help other sentient beings on the Buddhist path to awakening.
# The Gate of Nirvana is the "ultimate liberation", "knowing without any kind of defilement".{{sfn|Low|2006|p=32-39}}

===Opposition to "Do-nothing Zen"===
One of Hakuin's major concerns was the danger of what he called "Do-nothing Zen" teachers, who upon reaching some small experience of enlightenment devoted the rest of their life to, as he puts it, "passing day after day in a state of seated sleep".{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=3}} Quietist practices seeking simply to empty the mind, or teachers who taught that a tranquil "emptiness" was enlightenment, were Hakuin's constant targets. In this regard he was especially critical of  followers of the maverick Zen master [[Bankei]].{{sfn|Hakuin|2010|p=125, 126}} He stressed a never-ending and severe training to deepen the insight of enlightenment and forge one's ability to manifest it in all activities.{{sfn|Waddell|2010}}{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}} He urged his students to never be satisfied with shallow attainments, and truly believed that enlightenment was possible for anyone if they exerted themselves and approached their practice with real energy.{{sfn|Hakuin|2010}}

===Lay teachings===
An extremely well known and popular Zen master during his later life, Hakuin was a firm believer in bringing the wisdom of Zen to all people. Thanks to his upbringing as a commoner and his many travels around the country, he was able to relate to the [[rural]] population, and served as a sort of spiritual father to the people in the areas surrounding Shoin-ji. In fact, he turned down offers to serve in the great monasteries in [[Kyoto]], preferring to stay at Shoin-ji. Most of his instruction to the common people focused on living a morally virtuous life. Showing a surprising broad-mindedness, his ethical teachings drew on elements from [[Confucianism]], ancient Japanese traditions, and traditional Buddhist teachings. He also never sought to stop the rural population from observing non-Zen traditions, despite the seeming intolerance for other schools' practices in his writings.

In addition to this, Hakuin was also a popular Zen lecturer, traveling all over the country, often to Kyoto, to teach and speak on Zen. He wrote frequently in the last fifteen years of his life, trying to record his lessons and experiences for posterity. Much of his writing was in the [[vernacular]], and in popular forms of poetry that commoners would read.

===Calligraphy===
An important part of Hakuin's practice of Zen was his painting and [[calligraphy]]. He seriously took up painting only late in his life, at almost age sixty, but is recognized as one of the greatest Japanese Zen painters. His paintings were meant to capture Zen values, serving as sorts of "visual sermons" that were extremely popular among the laypeople of the time, many of whom were [[illiterate]]. Today, paintings of Bodhi Dharma by Hakuin Ekaku are sought after and displayed in a handful of the world's leading museums.

==Influence==
Through Hakuin, all contemporary Japanese Rinzai-lineages are part of the [[Ōtōkan]] lineage, brought to Japan in 1267 by [[Nanpo Jomyo]], who received dharma transmission in China in 1265.&lt;ref group=web name=ROZ&gt;[http://zen.rinnou.net/whats_zen/history.html#The%20Transmission%20of%20Zen%20to%20Japan Rinzai-Obaku Zen - What is Zen? - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

All contemporary Rinzai-lineages stem from Inzan Ien (1751–1814) and Takuju Kosen (1760–1833),{{sfn|Dumoulin-2005-B|p=392}}{{sfn|Stevens|1999|p=90}} both students of Gasan Jito (1727–1797). Gasan is considered to be a dharma heir of Hakuin, though "he did not belong to the close circle of disciples and was probably not even one of Hakuin's dharma heirs".{{sfn|Dumoulin-2005-B|p=391}}

==Writings==
Hakuin left a voluminous body of works, divided in Dharma Works (14 vols.) and [[Kanbun]] Works (4 vols.).&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.zenbunka.or.jp/en/investigation/entry/post_17.html Hakuin Study Group] has been researching the written works of Hakuin.&lt;/ref&gt; The following are the best known and edited in English.

'''Interactive children's books''' are a subset of [[children's books]] that require participation and interaction by the reader. Participation can range from books with texture to those with special devices used to help teach children certain tools. Interactive children's books may also incorporate modern technology or be computerized books. Movable books, a subsection of interactive books, are defined as "covering [[Pop-up book|pop-ups]], transformations, tunnel books, volvelles, flaps, pull-tabs, pop-outs, pull-downs, and more, each of which performs in a different manner. Also included, because they employ the same techniques, are three-dimensional greeting cards."{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Volvelles==
The earliest form of interactive books are thought to be [[volvelle]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/popup/theme.html]&lt;/ref&gt; a type of movable book with a wheel, which at the time was used to help display astrological and geographical maps.

== Pop-up books ==
It wasn't until the late nineteenth century, partly due to the invention of industrial printing, that [[Pop-up book|pop-ups]] were created. The first pop-up books published in America were those in the Showman Series published by the McLoughlin Brothers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/popup/showman.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these books were too expensive and fragile to be practical children's books. Pop-ups opened the door for the creation of many other types of interactive books for both children and adults. Despite a brief decline in production during the mid-twentieth century, it was a new idea that spawned quickly and eventually became the highly technological and advanced world of books that it is today.

== Coloring books ==
The [[coloring book]] format, of line drawings to which the child adds color, has been in production since the early 20th century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

== Gamebooks ==
[[Gamebook]]s are much like traditional books, but they offer the reader decisions throughout the book, with the decisions affecting the outcome of the story.  At each decision point, the reader is instructed to go to a particular page and/or paragraph to continue the story.  The first gamebook debuted in 1941.  The format was especially popular in the 1980s.

== Hidden object and picture books ==

Hidden object picture books engage readers of all ages by camouflaging items with the intention of children eventually finding them.  Whether the hidden object is a hard to spot character or an item specified by the author in a rhyming list, is subject to the book or possibly the series of books it belongs to.  Although it is not standard, these types of interactive children’s books are sometimes published with a common theme such as Christmas or life on the farm.  Children can interactively experience a selective number of these books as early as age four and beginning at a pre-kindergarten grade level, depending on how easily the hidden objectives can be located.  There are several notable authors and illustrators at the frontline assisting their audiences’ development of interactive reading skills in hidden object picture books:

===Martin Handford Where’s Wally?===
British illustrator [[Martin Handford]] is credited with the conception of the [[Where's Wally?]] series.  Despite the series christened title, his hidden picture books are more recognizable under the North American franchise’s version of the character, Waldo.  The purpose of Handford’s hidden object picture books is for children of all ages to identify Wally in a specified location throughout his “world-wide hike.” Although various activities and outfit similarities easily camouflage the character’s whereabouts, Wally always wears glasses and carries a walking stick and is famous for his outfit of a red and white horizontally striped shirt, blue trousers and a bobble hat.

The first book in Handford’s series, originally titled ''Where's Wally?'', was published in 1987. The book was soon followed by the release of [[Where's Wally Now?]] (1988) and [[Where's Wally?: The Fantastic Journey]] (1989). The books became extremely popular and were translated into many languages.  The trademark of Wally was adopted in 28 countries and the character is often given a different name and personality in the translations.

As more books were released the cast of characters grew as well - including Wizard Whitebeard, Wilma, Wenda, [[Woof (Where's Waldo)|Woof]], Odlaw and the Waldo Watchers.  More Waldo books followed - such as [[Where's Waldo in Hollywood?]], [[Where's Waldo?: The Wonder Book]] (1997), [[Where's Waldo?: The Great Picture Hunt]] (2006).

Waldo became a huge pop culture sensation in the early 1990s. The United States, in particular, was swept with "Waldo-mania".  Aside from the adaptations of Handford's books, the franchises grew to include licensing of Waldo for video games, spin-off books, magazines, dolls, toys, comics and a [[Where's Waldo? (TV series)]].

Wally has his own website where he dispatches messages to fans and invites them to join in on the chase through different social networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findwally.co.uk/ FindWally.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick I Spy===

[[I Spy (Scholastic)|I Spy]] is another interactive children’s book series that can be categorized as a hidden object picture book.  Debuting in 1992, the books consist of texts written by [[Jean Marzollo]] regarding items hidden within the photographs captured by [[Walter Wick]].

Wick’s photographs are set up in a cluttered assortment of items or to imitate a particular scene, like the toy shop window in I Spy: Christmas (1992).  Below the picture, Marzollo involves readers with a riddle asking them to locate specific items within Wick’s photograph.  Wick’s photographs are highly regarded for their expressive quality.

The series originated with I Spy: A Book of Picture Riddles (1992) and grew to include I Spy: Christmas (1992), I Spy: Fun House (1993), I Spy: Mystery (1993), I Spy: Fantasy (1994), I Spy: School Days (1995), I Spy: Spooky Night (1996), and I Spy: Treasure Hunt (1999).

A subsequent and more challenging series was begun in 1997 with I Spy: Super Challenger! (1997) and was continued with other installments such as I Spy: Gold Challenger! (1998), I Spy: Extreme Challenger! (2000), I Spy: Year-Round Challenger! (2001), and I Spy: Ultimate Challenger! (2003).

The I Spy label has grown to include video games based on the books such as [[I Spy Spooky Mansion]], [[I Spy Treasure Hunt]] and [[I Spy Fantasy]].

The franchise also includes Ultimate I Spy, an I Spy game for the [[Wii]]. I Spy: Fun House is being developed into a [[Nintendo DS]] game. The player is trapped in the actual fun-house and must find nine items to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ds.ign.com/articles/794/794633p1.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Wick is also author of his own hidden object series, similar to I Spy, called Can You See What I See?. These books feature photographs and poems that require readers to find objects in the picture. The puzzles are slightly easier than those of the I Spy books.

==Other Hidden Object Books==

Martin Handford, Jean Marzollo and Walter Wick are not the only three authors of hidden object picture books. However, they are the most established and recognized in the publishing world.  Another author worth mentioning is Gillian Doherty. She is a published author and editor of children's books. Her hidden object picture books include 1001 Monster Things to Spot, 1001 Things to Spot, 1001 Wizard Things to Spot, and 1001 Things to Spot.

== Touch and Feel books ==

Many interactive books are made specifically for children. Touch-and-feel books, or texturized books, fall in this area. The prime age for touch and feel books is from toddler-age to preschool. Because these books are aimed specifically at helping children develop knowledge while increasing the use of their senses, appeal is lost to older generations who more than likely already possess the skills being taught. One of the key advantages to teaching senses and vocabulary through the use of touch and feel books is the connection a child can gain by instantly being rewarded with the texture that the word describes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.childtrek.com/childrens-books/touch-feel-childrens-books.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091107101413/http://www.childtrek.com/childrens-books/touch-feel-childrens-books.html |archivedate=2009-11-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, touch-and-feel books have gone to a new level with the creation of fun new ways for younger children to interact with books such as musical "bath books" and "finger puppet books". Most, but not all, of these books are also "board books", which are made entirely out of hard pages. Making the pages out of a hard material provides for durability, allowing them to resist whatever they may contact along with the young readers. Bath books can be taken into the tub because of their floatable and waterproof pages. A few of the top touch and feel book publishers are Dorling Kindersley, Usborne, Macmillan, and Lamaze.

== Pop-up books ==
Children’s pop-up books are a form of interactive literature in which upon turning the page, an image literally “pops-up”.  These books provide 3-D illustrations made of unfolding paper that allow for the child to feel as if the book is coming to life.  First created in the mid-thirteenth century, they were originally not intended for children until publisher [[Robert Sayer]] created ''Harlquinade'' in 1765.  With his creating of a “lift-the-flap” book, he gave children a way to truly become involved with what they are reading.  From then, several other authors, such as [[William Grimaldi]], designed their version of the pop-up book depicting elaborate scenes from page to page that allowed for the reader to determine the outcome of the story.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.unt.edu/rarebooks/exhibits/popup2/introduction.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;
The pop-up book has evolved from a seemingly simplistic idea to one of more sophistication, as well as complication.  They have grown to be a genre that delights, intrigues, and educates children of all ages.

One key person in the pop-up book phenomenon is Waldo Hunt, who was the first to develop these books in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.seattlepi.com/bookpatrol/archives/186608.asp?from=blog_last3]&lt;/ref&gt; He found joy and creativity in the idea of creating a pop-up image in a book.  He was the true advocate and mastermind behind their conception and popularity.

Pop-up books are common enough to be found in your local library, bookstore, classroom, or likely even your own bookshelf. There are several examples of these kinds of books, but some famous ones to check out are: Christmas in New York by Chuck Fischer, Star Wars: A Pop-Up Guide to the Galaxy by Matthew Reinhart, and The Amazing Pop-Up Geography Book by Kate Petty.  Pop-up books can range from very simplistic 3-D illustrations to more intricate and detailed presentations depending upon the topic of the book, its author and illustrator, as well as the age of the audience they are appealing to.

== Digitized learning books ==

Many children’s interactive books have been enhanced through the use of technology. The earliest examples of this were books that had sound effects- a bar on the side of the book that had buttons corresponding with pictures in the story. When the icon appeared in the story, the reader could press a button on the side to hear the sound effect. These are called “sound books.” Books that had accompanying cassette tapes (or even CDs), usually known as books on tape, are another early example of this.

Once computers became more prevalent, CD-ROM versions of books became popular. These were programs that put books on the computer screen, enabling children to click their way through various words and pictures in the story and have it come alive. The technology was fairly limited, however, and not widespread as only children with access to a PC (and the knowledge to use it) could take advantage of it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.marketplaceadvisor.channeladvisor.com/hi/5/4830/lb-just-grandma-slv-f.jpg Richard Scarry's ''Just Grandma and Me''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The next big step in this technology was [[LeapPad|Leap Frog’s Leap Pad.]] The Leap Pad makes regular books interactive by enabling children to hear a word aloud, have the story read to them, have words and sounds spelled for them, play interactive learning games on many pages and more, simply by touching the included “pen” to different places on the page.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leapfrog.com/etc/medialib/leapfrog/parent_guides/pg_prekind.Par.36099.File.dat/pg_leappad.pd Leap Pad Parents’ Guide]&lt;/ref&gt; The system is divided into “Leap Levels” for different-aged children and includes everything from picture books to chapter books, with separate Leap Pads corresponding to each level. There is also a unit that allows new content to be downloaded from Leap Frog’s Web site. The technology of the Leap Pad continued evolving, and Leap Frog next came out with the [[Tag (LeapFrog)]]. Instead of a Pad unit where books must be inserted, the Tag system is essentially a “pen” onto which books can be downloaded. Then, the pen can be scanned across the corresponding book to read it aloud, unlock activities and more.
The goal for these products is to help children get more out of their books and learn to read, according to Leap Frog.  Leap Frog even has its own publishing company, Leap Frog Press, which creates books specifically designed for its system. The products are not cheap, though- the Leap Pad can cost as much as $80. The Tag is usually sold in gift packs that run anywhere from $20 to $75. Books for each are sold separately and typically cost $12 or more.
Of course, Leap Frog is not the only company with products like the Leap Pad or Tag system that use technology to enhance the reading experience for children. However, it was one of the first, and now several companies have copied the idea and made similar products.

The newest advance in interactive children's books reflects the recent popularity of [[Amazon Kindle|Amazon's Kindle.]] There are now a plethora of e-book sites that place children's picture books, along with LeapFrog-like sound effects and word pronunciation, completely online-often for free. Some will actually read an entire story aloud. These "virtual libraries have done a lot to both preserve books and make them more available.

Here are a few examples of some interactive e-book sites for children:

*[http://www.tumblebooks.com/library/asp/customer_login.asp?accessdenied=%2Flibrary%2Fasp%2Fhome%5FTumbleBooks%2Easp Tumble Books]

Even older classic books are moving to online to keep up with the times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findwaldo.com/ ''Where’s Waldo ''series of books] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104013730/http://findwaldo.com/ |date=2010-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scholastic.com/ispy/ the ''I Spy ''series of books]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Jealousy}}

[[File:Miyagawa Isshô-Spring Pastimes-H.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Love Letter from a Rival'''&lt;br&gt; A youth catches her boyfriend with a love letter from another.&lt;br&gt;
[[Miyagawa Isshô]], ca. 1750; Panel from a series of ten [[homosexuality|homoerotic]] scenes, on a [[Shunga (art)|shunga]]-style painted hand scroll (kakemono-e); sumi, color and gofun on silk. Private collection.]]
'''Jealousy in art''' deals with the way writers and graphic artists have approached the topic of jealousy in their works.

Jealousy is the powerful complex of emotions experienced at the loss, real or imagined, of something or someone you believe is yours, whereas envy concerns what you don’t have and would like to possess. Othello is filled with jealousy at the thought of losing Desdemona: Iago is consumed with envy of Othello’s prestige. Because jealous lovers tell multiple stories about those who arouse their jealousy, and because the emotion is so corrosive, jealousy is a common theme in literature and art, not to mention opera and cinema.

==Literature==
Literary works use a variety of devices to explore its possibilities and reveal its wider implications. Most famously, perhaps, Schahriar's destructive jealousy in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' is what precipitates Scheherazade’s creative outpouring of stories. In [[Ariosto]]’s ''[[Orlando furioso]]'' (1516) jealousy leads to such a distortion of the world that the sufferer is driven to madness. [[Shakespeare]]'s later play, ''the Winters tale'' (1613) is predominately about the jealousy felt by Leontes' and his supposed adulterous wife. [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]’s Princess Brambilla (1821) is more concerned with the interplay between jealousy and the theater, between reality and masks. In [[Charlotte Brontë]]’s ''Villette'' (1853) jealousy becomes a game of reflections and speculations, a potent denial of sexual stereotypes, and, like many novels written by women, an angry rejection of the violation of the individual caused by the gaze of the jealous lover. [[Anthony Trollope]] uses both ''He Knew He Was Right'' (1869) and ''Kept in the Dark'' (1882) to analyze not only double standards used to judge how men and women behave but also the relationship between mind and body. [[Tolstoy]]’s ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]'' (1889) offers a compelling exploration of jealousy acting as a front for repressed [[homosexuality]]. [[Proust]]’s ''In Search of Lost Time'' (1913–1927), especially the section concerning Albertine, represents the claustrophobic nature of the passion of jealousy through the tropes of imprisonment, illness and death, while [[Michal Choromanski]]’s ''Jealousy and Medicine'' (1932) creates a landscape and a climate that recreate to the full the physical experience of jealousy. [[Freud]]’s reading of jealousy and his emphasis on repetitive structures inspires [[Iris Murdoch]]’s ''A Word Child'' (1975) in which the [[London]] subway symbolizes endless repetition of the same.

Other novelists have used jealousy to explore the relationship between writer and reader, as well as that between fiction and reality. [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]]’s ''Jealousy'' (1965) develops the image of the window blind (in [[French language|French]] “la jalousie” means both the emotion and the window blind) to lock the reader into the jealous person’s mind, while in [[Julian Barnes]]’s ''Talking it Over'' (1991), the writer’s jealousy of the reader’s attention is as much a part of the story as the sexual jealousy it also examines. [[A. S. Byatt]]’s ''Possession'' (1990) is in part an analysis of the ways in which writing and reading operate to silence other voices.

==Graphic arts==
[[File:On the Beach -- Two Are Company, Three Are None.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Two are Company, Three Are None'', 1872, a [[wood engraving]] by [[Winslow Homer]]]]
In art, depicting a face reflecting the ravages of jealousy was a frequent studio exercise: see for instance drawings by [[Charles Le Brun]] (1619–1690) or [[Sébastien Leclerc (1676-1763)|Sébastien Leclerc]] (the Younger) (1676–1763), or in a fuller treatment, the howling figure on the left in [[Bronzino]]’s ''An Allegory with Venus and Cupid'' (probably 1540-50). [[Albrecht Dürer]]’s 1498 drawing, ''Hercules’s Jealousy'' depicts jealousy as a powerfully built woman armed with a sword. The theme of jealousy is frequently conveyed through images of the gaze as in [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]]’s ''Paolo and Francesca'' (1819) which reveals the jealous husband’s gaze catching the young lovers’ first kiss. [[Edvard Munch]]’s many depictions of jealousy, however, tend to place the husband at the front of the painting with a couple behind him as if to suggest that jealousy is created more by the mind than by the gaze. This suggestion is intensified by his cunning use of symbolic colors. There are, nevertheless, lighter moments, as when [[Gaston de La Touche]] (1854–1913), in ''Jealousy or the Monkey'' shows a love scene interrupted by a monkey tugging on the woman’s dress. While popular images of jealousy tend to the lurid, it remains a source, both in literature and in painting, of highly creative artistic strategies that have little to do with the negative and destructive sides of the emotion itself.

The '''''Lamentation of Christ''''' (also known as ''Deposition'') is an [[oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by the  Italian Renaissance artist [[Antonio Allegri|Correggio]], dating from around  1524  and housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale di Parma|Galleria Nazionale]] of [[Parma]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The work is one of the canvasses commissioned by Parmesan noble Placido Del Bono for a chapel in the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Parma|San Giovanni Evangelista]] in Parma. They are mentioned (although wrongly assigned to the [[Parma Cathedral|city's cathedral]]) by late Renaissance art biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] in the first edition of his ''Lives'' (1550).

==Description==
The work shows the common [[Lamentation of Christ]] theme, with Jesus depicted immediately after his deposition from the cross, surrounded by the people who loved him in life. They include John, who supports a [[Virgin Mary]] shattered by pain, [[Mary Magdalene]] crying at Jesus' feet and, in the background, [[Nicodemus]] with the pincer he used to remove Christ's nails. The composition was studied accurately to be watched from an oblique point of view, from the entrance of the Del Bono chapel in the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Parma|San Giovanni Evangelista]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21288">The '''League of American Writers''' was an association of American [[novelist]]s, [[playwright]]s, [[poet]]s, [[journalist]]s, and [[literary critic]]s launched by the [[Communist Party USA]] (CPUSA) in 1935. The group included Communist Party members, and so-called "[[fellow travelers]]" who closely followed the Communist Party's [[political line]] without being formal party members, as well as individuals sympathetic to specific policies being advocated by the organization.

The League's policy objectives changed over time in accord with the shifting party line of the CPUSA. Beginning as an [[anti-fascist]] organization in 1935, the League turned to an [[anti-war]] position following the signing of the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] of 1939 and to a pro-war position after the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the Soviet Union in June 1941. The organization was prominent in the defense of [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican Spain]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and in providing financial and moral support to writers in need in the United States and internationally.

The organization was terminated in January 1943.

==Organizational history==
===Formation===
The '''League of American Writers''' was established by the First American Writers Congress, a gathering held from April 26–28, 1935.&lt;ref name="Dies967"&gt;"League of American Writers," in Special Committee on Un-American Activities, House of Representatives, ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX, Communist Front Organizations, Second Section.'' Washington: US Government Printing Office, 1944; pg. 967.&lt;/ref&gt; (According to member [[Myra Page]], it started on May 1, 1935–[[May Day]].&lt;ref name=Looper&gt;

The organization was affiliated with the International Union of Revolutionary Writers (IURW)&lt;ref name="Dies967" /&gt; as well as the International Association of Writers for the Defense of Culture and was the American equivalent of the British League of Writers.&lt;ref name="FF29"&gt;[[Franklin Folsom]], ''Days of Anger, Days of Hope: A Memoir of the League of American Writers, 1937–1942.'' Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1994; pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial members included: [[Alexander Trachtenberg]] of [[International Publishers]], [[Frank Folsom]], [[Louis Untermeyer]], Bromfelds, [[I.F. Stone]], [[Millen Brand]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Lillian Hellman]], and [[Dashiell Hammett]], and [[Myra Page]].&lt;ref name=Looper/&gt;

In an article in the magazine of the IURW, ''International Literature,'' League of American Writers member Alan Calmer noted that the new organization sprung from a decision made at the 1934 convention of the Communist Party's [[John Reed Clubs]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The chief malady of the revolutionary culture movement was characterized at the second national conference of the John Reed Clubs in 1934 as the old malady of [[sectarianism]]. ... Pointing to these handicaps, the delegates to the conference instructed their executive committee to take the initiative in sponsoring a broad conference of left-wing authors ... A new organization committee was formed, which gradually involved more and more sympathetic writers into the leadership of the committee which issued the "Call for an American Writers Congress" at the beginning of 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Calmer in ''International Literature,'' no. 7, 1935, pp. 73–75; quoted in ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pp. 967–968.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The convention call for establishing the first Congress of American Writers declared that [[capitalism]] was rapidly crumbling and sought to gather the "hundreds of poets, novelists, dramatists, critics, short story writers and journalists" who recognized "the necessity of personally helping to accelerate the destruction of capitalism and the establishment of a workers' government."&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.gwu.edu/~cuff/wright/organizations/awc-call.html Text of the Call for the American Writers Congress of 1935,] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404100113/http://home.gwu.edu/~cuff/wright/organizations/awc-call.html |date=2008-04-04 }} ''The New Masses,'' January 22, 1935, pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding convention of the League was called to order at the [[Mecca Temple]] in New York City, attended by 400 invited "writer-delegates" in front of a total audience of nearly 5,000.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;Milton Howard, "5,000 Greet Writers Who Pledge Fight on Fascism, War: 400 Authors Gather in Parley to Discuss Their Role in Fight" ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 12, no. 102 (April 29, 1935), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although later called a "[[front group]]," the Communist Party's role in the League of American Writers was never secret. [[Earl Browder]], General Secretary of the CPUSA, delivered the keynote address to the delegates of the First Congress of the League of American Writers at its opening session.&lt;ref name="Browder"&gt;Earl Browder, "Text of Speech by Browder at American Writers Congress," ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 12, no. 102 (April 29, 1935), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Browder acknowledged that writers were typically "skeptical of all political parties, if not contemptuous." He continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They find, however, in the new life in which they participate, there is a political party which plays an increasingly influential role, the Communist Party. They find it necessary to define their attitudes towards this Party which actively participates in their chosen world. They see that this Party is a force in fine literature, as well as in strikes, in unemployment struggles, in battling for Negro rights, even in reactionary Congress ... Yes, the Communist Party is a force, in every phase of the life of the masses, even that of poets, dramatists, novelists, and critics.&lt;ref name="Browder" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Joining Browder in addressing the delegates to the organization's founding convention was CPUSA political committee member [[Clarence Hathaway]], who greeted the Congress in the name of "the entire staff of ''The Daily Worker,''" the official newspaper of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Dies969"&gt;''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 969.&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading CPUSA activists addressing the gathering included [[Moissaye Olgin]] of the Yiddish-language ''[[Morning Freiheit]],'' [[Joseph Freeman (writer)|Joseph Freeman]] of ''[[The New Masses]],'' and [[Alexander Trachtenberg]] of [[International Publishers]], part of the CPUSA's publishing arm.&lt;ref name="Bloom400"&gt;Alexander Bloom, ''Prodigal Sons: The New York Intellectuals and Their World.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1987; pg. 400, footnote 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The group declared itself to be "a voluntary association of writers dedicated to the preservation and extension of a truly democratic culture."

[[Waldo Frank]] was elected the first president of the new organization.&lt;ref name="DaysOfRage"&gt;[[Franklin Folsom]], ''Days of Anger, Days of Hope: A Memoir of the League of American Writers, 1937–1942.'' Niwot, CO: University Press of Colorado, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; The governing Executive Council elected by the first Congress included Frank, Freeman, Trachtenberg, [[Michael Gold]], [[Granville Hicks]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Josephine Herbst]], [[Albert Maltz]], [[Kenneth Burke]], [[Harold Clurman]], Hart, Josephson, Lawson, Scheider, Seaver, [[Genevieve Taggard]] and [[Alfred Kreymborg]].&lt;ref name="Bloom400" /&gt;

===Development===

The League of American Writers was a dues based organization, with annual dues set at $5 per year, payable in advance on January 1 of each year.&lt;ref name="Bull3-1"&gt;''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers,'' vol. 3, no. 3 (January 1938), pg. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Participants who were members of local or regional chapters paid dues to that organization, with $2 of the $5 remitted to the National Office; others stood as members at large and paid dues directly to New York.&lt;ref name="Bull3-1" /&gt;

Although the League of American Writers was technically a "mass organization" of the CPUSA in the sense that it sought to unite party members with non-party individuals sharing the general Communist Party orientation, membership in the organization was limited by design to the literary elite. Several months after the April 1935 founding congress, membership in the group was reported as only 125 — far fewer than the 400 who had attended the founding convention as delegates.&lt;ref name="Klehr353"&gt;Harvey Klehr, ''The Heyday of American Communism: The Depression Decade.'' New York: Basic Books, 1984; pg. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; "Applications for membership flow in, but the standard is kept high, membership is granted only to creative writers whose published work entitles them to a professional status," noted Isidor Schneider.&lt;ref name="Klehr353" /&gt;

According to the group's formal membership application, membership in the League was "open to all writers whose work has been published  or used with reasonable frequency in channels of communication of more than local scope, including magazines, newspapers, the radio, the stage, and the screen."&lt;ref name="App"&gt;"Application for Membership" in ''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers,'' vol. 3, no. 3 (January 1938).&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, members had to accept and observe a set of 7 membership aims:

: 1. To enlist writers in all parts of the United States in a national cultural organization for peace and democracy and against fascism and reaction.
: 2. To defend the political and social institutions that guarantee a healthy atmosphere for the perpetuation of culture ... 
: 3. To stimulate the interest of other writers in our program ... 
: 4. To support progressive trade union organization, especially among professionals and in the liberal arts.
: 5. To effect an alliance, in the interest of culture, between American writers and all progressive forces in the nation.
: 6. To support the People's Front in all countries.
: 7. To cooperate with similar organizations of writers in other countries.&lt;ref name="App" /&gt;

The League of American Writers was governed by Congresses held every two years. The organization also had a number of local chapters which conducted various fundraising activities and events designed to raise public awareness about matters of concern to the League. Chapters were maintained in [[New York City]], [[Washington, DC]], [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="Dies978"&gt;''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 978.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization published an official newsletter, ''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers.''&lt;ref name="Dies978" /&gt;

A number of prominent writers were enlisted in the cause over the next several years, including [[Thomas Mann]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Theodore Dreiser]], [[James T. Farrell|James Farrell]], [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Nathanael West]], [[Elsa Gidlow]] and [[William Carlos Williams]].&lt;ref name="Klehr353" /&gt; The participation of many of these literary luminaries in League affairs was often nominal, limited to signature of an occasional petition.&lt;ref name="Klehr353" /&gt; This effort at gathering prominent figures was assisted by a muting the explicitly revolutionary language and communist tone of the organization by the time of its June 1937 second convention.&lt;ref&gt;Klehr, ''The Heyday of American Communism,'' pg. 354.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1937 convention was a more subdued affair than the high-profile 1935 launch, with its opening at [[Carnegie Hall]] attended by 50 "writer-delegates."&lt;ref name="WritersSpeak"&gt;"Writers to Open Congress: Rep. Bernard, Stewart Will Speak at Carnegie Hall," ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 14, no. 133 (June 4, 1937), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The keynote speech was delivered by Ernest Hemingway, newly returned from the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Hemingway denounced fascism as "a lie told by bullies" and declared that "a writer who will not lie cannot live or work under fascism."&lt;ref name="Klehr355"&gt;Klehr, ''The Heyday of American Communism,'' pg. 355.&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from the film ''[[The Spanish Earth]]'' were shown to the audience.&lt;ref name="WritersSpeak" /&gt;

Communist Party General Secretary Earl Browder again spoke to the 1937 convention, emphasizing the CPUSA's "[[Popular front|Popular Front]]" analysis that the world was divided into "two great warring camps, democracy against fascism" and leaving it to writers to "adjust their own work to the higher discipline of the whole struggle for democracy."&lt;ref name="Browder37"&gt;Earl Browder, "Speech of Earl Browder: Second Congress of American Writers," ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 14, no. 135 (June 5, 1937), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Gone was talk of the collapse of capitalism and the duty of writers to speed its demise as participants in the class struggle; now the task at hand, in Browder's view, was the building of "broad unity of all democratic and progressive forces ... against the menace of fascist barbarism."&lt;ref name="Browder37" /&gt;

Frank was replaced as President of the League in 1937, owing to his questioning of the evidence and verdicts being rendered at the great [[Moscow Show Trials|"Show Trials" in Moscow]].&lt;ref name="Dies970"&gt;''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 970.&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced as President by [[Donald Ogden Stewart]].&lt;ref name="Dies970" /&gt; The professional head of the organization as Executive Secretary from 1937 to 1942 was Communist Party stalwart [[Franklin Folsom]].&lt;ref name="Klehr355" /&gt; The League touted seven prominent Vice-Presidents during the last years of the 1930s, including [[Van Wyck Brooks]], [[Erskine Caldwell]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Paul DeKruif]], [[Langston Hughes]], [[Meridel LeSueur]], and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref name="Dies976"&gt;Letterhead from July 1939 in ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 976.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 3rd Congress of the League of American Writers, held in New York City in June 1939, once again opened with a Friday night public session at Carnegie Hall. Poet [[Langston Hughes]] delivered the keynote address, in which he likened [[African-American history#Jim Crow, disfranchisement and challenges|the situation of American blacks]] to that of [[Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933–1939)|the Jewish minority in Germany]], with but one difference: "Here we may speak openly about our problems, write about them, protest, and seek to better our conditions.In Germany the Jews may do none of those things."&lt;ref&gt;Langston Hughes, "'We Want America to Really Be America for Everybody,' Says Langston Hughes," ''The Daily Worker,'' vol. 16, no. 133 (June 5, 1939), pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' speech was broadly democratic and did not include revolutionary sloganeering.

===Publications===

The League of American Writers somewhat irregularly published a mimeographed newsletter for its members, ''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers.''&lt;ref&gt;A virtually complete run of this publication may be found in the League of American Writers Papers at the University of California, Berkeley. This material has been microfilmed and appears at the start of microfilm reel 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Circulation was small, with a press run of 700 copies cited in an issue from November 1937, and few specimens seem to have survived.&lt;ref&gt;"An Apology to Californians," ''The Bulletin of the League of American Writers,'' vol. 3, no. 2 (November 1937), pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 the League of American Writers sent out surveys to over 1,000 American writers asking their position on the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Some 418 returned the survey forms, with 410 supporting the Loyalists to the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], 7 professing neutrality, and only one — [[Gertrude Atherton]] — supporting General [[Francisco Franco]] and his nationalist forces.&lt;ref name="FF3031"&gt;Folsom, ''Days of Anger, Days of Hope,'' pp. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt; In accord with the CPUSA's political line, no effort was made to contact writers known to be sympathetic to [[Leon Trotsky]]. When [[Max Eastman]], a translator of Trotsky and opponent of [[Joseph Stalin]], was inadvertently mailed a survey form, Eastman's reply was excluded at the insistence of Communist Party newspaper editor [[Moissaye Olgin]].&lt;ref name="FF3031" /&gt; The other replies were distilled into a pamphlet published by the League of American Writers, entitled ''Writers Take Sides.''&lt;ref name="FF3031" /&gt;

===Decline and dissolution===

With the signing of the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]] in the fall of 1939, the League of American Writers turned its official policy from one of advocacy of [[collective security]] against [[fascism]] in Europe to one of opposition to the so-called "imperialist war," in accord with a change in the political line of the [[Communist International]] and the CPUSA.&lt;ref name="Dies970" /&gt; This abrupt reversal was not cost-free to the organization, however, as series of prominent members of the League of American Writers left the group's ranks. Those exiting during this "[[Yanks Are Not Coming]]" period included [[Archibald MacLeish]], [[Malcolm Cowley]], [[Van Wyck Brooks]], [[Thomas Mann]], and [[Granville Hicks]], among others.&lt;ref name="Dies971"&gt;''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX,'' pg. 971.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1940, the League formed a ''[[Keep America Out of War Committee]].'' This group's members included: [[Lillian Hellman]], [[Dashiell Hammett]], [[Lawrence Treat|Lawrence A. Goldstone]], [[Eleanor Flexner]], [[Ed Lacy|Len Zinberg]], [[Shaemas O'Sheel]], and [[Sonia Raiziss]], among others.&lt;ref name="DaysOfRage" /&gt;

[[Theodore Dreiser]] was honorary president of the League of American Writers in 1941.&lt;ref name="Folsom"&gt;[[Franklin Folsom]], [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1132/is_n1_v47/ai_16892067 "Notes on Writergate: Harassment against League of American Writers], ''Monthly Review,'' May 1995. Published online by CBS MoneyWatch.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The League again abruptly shifted its political position, ending its anti-war stance, with the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]] in the summer of 1941.&lt;ref name="DaysOfRage" /&gt; Echoing another abrupt change of the political line of the CPUSA, the League of American Writers became advocates of American entry into [[World War II]] in defense of the Soviet Union.

The League of American Writers was terminated in January 1943.&lt;ref name="FF265"&gt;Folsom, ''Days of Anger, Days of Hope,'' pg. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The archive of the League of American Writers is housed at the [[Bancroft Library]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The collection has been [[microfilm]]ed, with the master negative held by the Rare Books and Special Collections Department at the university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/view?docId=tf9w100843;query=;style=oac4;view=admin#odd-1.3.4 Guide to the League of American Writers archives: Scope and Content], Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley.

[[File:La fábula de Leda (Cajés (copia de Correggio)).jpg|thumb|The 1604 copy by Eugenio Cajés before the painting left Spain, showing the original's state before it was damaged and restored ([[Museo del Prado]], [[Madrid]]).]]
'''''Leda and the Swan''''' is an oil on canvas painting from 1530-1531 by the Italian painter [[Correggio]], now in the [[Gemäldegalerie]] in [[Berlin]]. It shows three scenes of [[Leda (mythology)|Leda]]'s seduction by [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] who has taken the form of a swan. Their first meeting is shown on the right hand side and their lovemaking in the centre, where Leda sits with the swan between her thighs, guiding him with her left hand. They are accompanied to their left by Cupid with his bow and two cupids with flutes. The third scene (again on the right hand side) is the swan flying away whilst Leda gets dressed. [[Leda and the Swan]] was a common subject in 16th-century art.

==History==
Correggio conceived a series of works entitled ''Amori di Giove'' or ''Love Affairs of Jupiter'' after the success of ''[[Venus and Cupid with a Satyr]]''. The series eventually consisted of two pairs of works, each pair having the same dimensions, though he may have planned for there to be more. The precise order of the four works is still debated, though their main importance lies in their contribution to the development of secular and mythological painting via its new and extraordinary balance between naturalist rendering and poetic transfiguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Pierluigi De Vecchi ed [[Elda Cerchiari]], ''I tempi dell'arte'', volume 2, Bompiani, Milano 1999, p. 236. {{ISBN|88-451-7212-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correggio had made a study of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[Leda and the Swan (Michelangelo)|Leda and the Swan]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Ewart Popham]], ''Correggio's Drawings'', London 1957, cat. n. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Vasari]]'s ''[[Lives of the Artists]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [[Giorgio Vasari]], ''[[Le vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori]]'', Firenze 1550, ed. cons. a cura di Luciano Bellosi e Aldo Rossi, Einaudi, [[Turin|Torino]] 1991, II, p. 563.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Leda'' and a ''Venus'' (i.e. ''[[Danaë (Correggio)|Danaë]]'') were commissioned by [[Federico II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua]] as a gift for [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]]. This is supported by the theory that Jupiter was flying out of the right hand side of ''Leda'' in swan form and into the left hand side of ''Danaë'' in golden-shower form. However, one more recent study&lt;ref&gt;Egon Verheyen, ''Correggio's Amori di Giove'', in ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'', XXIX (1966), pp. 160-192.&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that all the paintings in the ''amori di Giove'' series were produced for the ''Sala di Ovidio'' ([[Ovid]] Room) in [[Mantua]] (meant for the duke's lover [[Isabella Boschetti]]) and only moved to Spain after Federico II's death in 1540, perhaps on the infante [[Philip II of Spain|Philip]]'s marriage to [[Maria Manuela, Princess of Portugal|Maria Emanuela d'Aviz]] (1543).

In 1601 ''[[Ganymede Abducted by the Eagle]]'' and 1603 this painting were still in the Spanish royal collections - and were both acquired that year by [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] and taken to [[Prague]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smb-digital.de/eMuseumPlus?service=ExternalInterface&amp;module=collection&amp;objectId=862455&amp;viewType=detailView Staatliche Museen zu Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt; The paintings' later owners were similar to those of ''Danaë'' - it moved to Sweden during the [[Thirty Years War]] and [[Christina of Sweden]] gave it to cardinal [[Decio Azzolini]]; it was later in the famous [[Orleans Collection]] owned by [[Philippe II, Duke of Orléans]]. However, his devout son [[Louis, Duke of Orléans (1703–1752)|Louis]] found the painting too licentious and attacked it with a knife, irreparably damaging Leda's face.

What was left of the painting was given to [[Charles-Antoine Coypel]], first painter to the king, who painted a replacement head. Still in pieces, the painting was sold in 1753 to the collector Pasquier, who commissioned the painter [[Jacques-François Delyen]] to paint a new replacement head - in 1755 the count of Epinaille bought it on behalf of [[Frederick the Great]], who hung it in his summer palace of [[Sanssouci]]. It was confiscated by Napoleon and restored again by [[Pierre-Paul Prud'hon]] before being returned to Germany in 1814 and placed in the Berlin museums in 1830 - there [[Jakob Schlesinger]] painted a third replacement for Leda's head.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cecil Gould]], ''The paintings of Correggio'', London 1976, pp. 194-196.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1604 copy shows that even this restoration censored Correggio's original composition, giving Leda a chaste rather than orgasmic expression and removing the backwards twist of her head that Correggio had originally intended (similar to that of Io in his ''[[Jupiter and Io]]'').

== Story ==
Daniel Park is an unpopular, fat, ugly, and bullied high school student who is looked down upon. Constantly bullied and harassed everyday, he often reacts rashly to his mother, and asks for a school transfer. Resolving to run away from his current problems and to start fresh, he moves to Seoul and goes to his new high school. However, the night before he goes to school, he obtains a new body which is tall, muscular, and very handsome. 

Now being able to see the world through a completely different view, he experiences the world as someone who everyone envies. Despite this, his days are always split between the two bodies, resolving to use his handsome body for the daytime and the other for night. As Daniel lives his life with his two bodies, he begins to see just how much the world discriminates against people simply for being "different." Hence the titular name of "Lookism." 

Through his original body, he experiences the world's discrimination and hate, while also seeing the beauty of the world through the other. His new body takes him through numerous life experiences from becoming a miniature celebrity, a trainee for an entertainment company, living through the underworld of Seoul, and modeling for clothes. Once the day turns to night, however, this rosy dream turns back into a harsh reality of what the world really is, all the discrimination coming back to haunt Daniel once more.

===Arcs and side stories===

''Park Hyung Suk/Daniel Park :'' Daniel Park was seen as an immature high school student that is bullied by Logan Lee at the start of the series, transferred by his mother and he woke up one day with a slimmer and near-perfect body near his chubby one. Over time, however, his naivety disappears, and he begins to mature more and more. Through his new body, he makes new friends and gradually begins to blossom into someone with a kind and courageous heart. He studies at J high school in the fashion department. He likes the chubby Crystal in both forms, but she prefers the chubby one over his beautiful body

''Lee Eun Tae/Vasco :'' Vasco, from the architecture dept., has the reputation of being a Robin Hood, as in he stands up for the weak and the bullied. He is one of the strongest of the comic and looks like a gangster (he's the leader of a group called Burn Knuckles).

==Theme==
The title speaks on itself, [[lookism]], or bias upon external part of a person. The main character is a fat, bespectacled man and bullied by stronger men.
The story also has themes about bullying (both physical, verbal and mental), physical violence (like Vasco getting doodles by a bully during his youth), hierarchy based on strength and looks, extortion, [[animal hoarding]], [[stalking]] to the point of obsession, [[gangsterism]], [[scams]], robbery, and even darker themes like rape, celebrity pressures, acute physical injuries and even attempted murder (in which Jiho [[defenestration|pushed]] Daniel and James through a window).

==Character designs==
Daniel Park's design was inspired by a model named Park Hyeong-seok. Jay Hong's design was inspired by Hong Jae-yeol, another model. DG was inspired on [[G-Dragon]]. The creator of manga is Park Tae-joon, another fitting model and all his characters are designed after real-life persons.

'''Marcel Lempereur-Haut''' (1898, [[Liège (city)|Liège]] – 1986, [[Lille]]) was a [[Belgian]] painter. He took drawing lessons at the Liège Academy of Fine Arts where he obtained a diploma in surveying and, after [[World War I]] he worked as a technical [[technical drawing|draughtsman]].

In 1920, he joined the group publishing the ''Anthologie'' art magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=1997 |journal=Revue belge d'archéologie et d'histoire de l'art |publisher=Académie royale d'archéologie de Belgique |volume=66 |pages=149 |issn=0035-077X }}&lt;/ref&gt; He started his artistic career by producing book illustrations and prints, mostly inspired by [[cubism]]. He produced his first [[abstract art]] in 1921, and in 1922 befriended [[František Kupka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Actuel XX: la peinture à Liège au XXe siècle |last=Parisse |first=Jacques |year=1975 |publisher=Editions Mardaga |isbn=978-2-8021-0006-5 |page=170 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1932, he participated in the exhibitions of the [[musicalism|musicalist artists]].

He lived in Paris from 1945 to 1958, and participated in the exhibitions  of the ''[[Salon des Réalités Nouvelles]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Réalités nouvelles: 1946-1956 : [exposition], Musée des beaux-arts de Calais, 9 février-8 avril 1980 |last=Lhotellier |first=Henry |author2=Dominique Viéville |year=1980 |publisher=Musée des beaux-arts de Calais |oclc=8346369 |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this stage, his work mainly comprised combinations of circles, spirals and stars. His later works were mostly decorative.

Lempereur-Haut continued to paint into at least his late seventies, limiting himself to crayons on cardboard after a [[cataract]] operation in 1976 restricted his vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Art &amp; ophthalmology: the impact of eye diseases on painters |last=Lanthony |first=Philippe |year=2009 |publisher=Kugler Publications |isbn=978-90-6299-460-1 |pages=82–83 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[retrospective exhibition]] of his work was held in Lille in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lempereur-Haut, rétrospective: du 18 octobre au 29 décembre 1985 |year=1985 |publisher=Musée d'art moderne, Lille |oclc=464029426 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knell Wellcome V0031505.jpg|thumb|''Saint Agnes'', mezzotint by [[John Smith (engraver)|John Smith]] after [[Godfrey Kneller]], usually thought to be a portrait of his daughter, Catherine Voss, by his mistress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historicalportraits.com/Gallery.asp?Page=Item&amp;ItemID=756&amp;Desc=Catherine-Voss-as-St-Agnes-by-Sir-Godfrey-Kneller-Bt. Portrait of Miss Voss as St Agnes 1690s]&lt;/ref&gt;]] 
'''Mezzotint''' is a [[printmaking]] process of the [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] family, technically a [[drypoint]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mezzotint|title=Definition of MEZZOTINT|author=|date=|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[Grayscale|tonal method]] to be used, enabling half-tones to be produced without using line- or dot-based techniques like [[hatching]], cross-hatching or [[stipple]]. Mezzotint achieves tonality by roughening a metal plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth, called a "rocker".  In printing, the tiny pits in the plate hold the ink when the face of the plate is wiped clean. A high level of quality and richness in the print can be achieved.

==History==
[[Image:Ludwig von Siegen - Portrait of Amelie Elisabeth von Hessen.jpg|thumb|The first known mezzotint, by [[Ludwig von Siegen]], 1642]]
The mezzotint printmaking method was invented by the German amateur artist [[Ludwig von Siegen]] (1609–{{circa|1680}}). His earliest mezzotint print dates to 1642 and is a portrait of [[Countess Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-Münzenberg]].  This was made by working from light to dark. The rocker seems to have been invented by [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine]], a famous cavalry commander in the [[English Civil War]], who was the next to use the process, and took it to England.  Sir [[Peter Lely]] saw the potential for using it to publicise his portraits, and encouraged a number of Dutch printmakers to come to England.  [[Godfrey Kneller]] worked closely with [[John Smith (engraver)|John Smith]], who is said to have lived in his house for a period; he created about 500 mezzotints, some 300 copies of portrait paintings.  

The process was especially widely used in England from the eighteenth century, to reproduce portraits and other paintings.  Since the mid-nineteenth century it has been relatively little used. [[Robert Kipniss]] and [[Peter Ilsted]] are two notable 20th-century exponents of the technique; [[M. C. Escher]] also made eight mezzotints.

British mezzotint collecting was a great craze from about 1760 to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|Great Crash]] of 1929, also spreading to America.  The main area of collecting was British portraits; hit oil paintings from the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] were routinely, and profitably, reproduced in mezzotint throughout this period, and other mezzotinters reproduced older portraits of historical figures, or if necessary, made them up.  The favourite period to collect was roughly from 1750 to 1820, the great period of the British portrait.  There were two basic styles of collection: some concentrated on making a complete collection of material within a certain scope, while others aimed at perfect condition and quality (which declines in mezzotints after a relatively small number of impressions are taken from a plate), and in collecting the many "[[State (printmaking)|proof states]]" which artists and printers had obligingly provided for them from early on.  Leading collectors included [[William Eaton, 2nd Baron Cheylesmore]] and the Irishman [[John Chaloner Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, 134–137 and 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dark to light method==
This became the most common method.  The whole surface (usually) of a [[metal]], usually copper, plate is roughened evenly, manually with a rocker, or mechanically.  If the plate were printed at this point it would show as solid black. The image is then created by selectively burnishing areas of the surface of the metal plate with metal tools; the smoothed parts will print lighter than those areas not smoothed by the burnishing tool. A burnisher has a smooth, round end, which flattens the minutely protruding points comprising the roughened surface of the metal printing plate.  Areas smoothed completely flat will not hold ink at all; such areas will print "white," that is, without ink.  By varying the degree of smoothing, mid-tones between black and white can be created, hence the name ''mezzo-tinto'' which is [[Italian language|Italian]] for "[[half-tone]]" or "half-painted".  This is called working from "dark to light", or the "subtractive" method.

==Light to dark method==
[[Image:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg|thumb|left|Early mezzotint by Vaillerant, Siegen's assistant or tutor. Young man reading, with statue of Cupid. Probably made using light to dark technique. 27.5 &amp;times; 21.3 cm]]
Alternatively, it is possible to create the image directly by only roughening a blank plate selectively, where the darker parts of the image are to be.  This is called working from "light to dark", or the "additive" method.  The first mezzotints by [[Ludwig von Siegen]] were made in this way. Especially in this method, the mezzotint can be combined with other intaglio techniques, such as engraving, on areas of the plate not roughened, or even with the dark to light method.

==Printing==
Printing the finished plate is the same for either method, and follows the normal way for an intaglio plate; the whole surface is inked, the ink is then wiped off the surface to leave ink only in the pits of the still rough areas below the original surface of the plate. The plate is put through a high-pressure printing press next to a sheet of paper, and the process repeated.

Because the pits in the plate are not deep, only a small number of top-quality impressions (copies) can be printed before the quality of the tone starts to degrade as the pressure of the press begins to smooth them out.  Perhaps only one or two hundred really good impressions can be taken.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

==Detailed technique==
Plates can be mechanically roughened; one way is to rub fine metal filings over the surface with a piece of glass; the finer the filings, the smaller the grain of the surface. Special roughening tools called 'rockers' have been in use since at least the eighteenth century. The method commonly in use today is to use a steel rocker approximately five inches wide, which has between 45 and 120 teeth per inch on the face of a blade in the shape of a shallow arc, with a wooden handle projecting upwards in a T-shape. Rocked steadily from side to side at the correct angle, the rocker will proceed forward creating burrs in the surface of the [[copper]]. The plate is then moved – either rotated by a set number of degrees or through 90 degrees according to preference – and then rocked in another pass. This is repeated until the plate is roughened evenly and will print a completely solid tone of black.

==Tone==
Mezzotint is known for the luxurious quality of its tones: first, because an evenly, finely roughened surface holds a lot of ink, allowing deep solid colors to be printed; secondly because the process of smoothing the plate with [[Burin (engraving)|burin]], ''burnisher'' and ''scraper'' allows fine gradations in tone to be developed. The scraper is a triangular ended tool, and the burnisher has a smooth round end – not unlike many spoon handles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">'''Neo-Fauvism''' was a poetic style of painting from the mid-1920s proposed as a challenge to [[Surrealism]].&lt;ref name=grant&gt;Grant, Kim. ''Surrealism and the Visual Arts: Theory and Reception'', [http://www.cambridge.org/aus/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780521836555&amp;ss=exc Introduction]. Cambridge University Press 2005. {{ISBN|978-0-521-83655-5}}, {{ISBN|0-521-83655-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The magazine ''Cahiers d'Art'' was launched in 1926 and its writers mounted a challenge to the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] practice of [[Surrealist automatism|automatism]] by seeing it not in terms of [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] expression, but as another development of traditional artistry. They identified a group of artists as the exponents of this and termed them Neo-Fauves.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;

Although these artists were later mostly forgotten, the movement had an effect of disillusioning the Surrealist group with the technique of graphic automatism as a revolutionary means of by-passing conventional aesthetics, ideology and commercialism.&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; 

Neo-Fauvism has been seen as the last trend within painting that could be marketed as a coherent style.&lt;ref name=GoetheInsitut&gt;[http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm Goethe-Institut], retrieved 10 June 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822212258/http://www.goethe.de/kue/bku/thm/ein/en178614.htm |date=August 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Nor of Human:  An Anthology of Fantastic Creatures''''' is the first short story [[anthology]] published by the Canberra Speculative Fiction Guild. Printed in 2001 under {{ISBN|0-646-41393-7}} and edited by Geoffrey Maloney, it contains stories from several Australian speculative fiction authors.

The anthology was one of the first projects the newly founded CSFG embarked on, as a way to provide a focus for members' activities and as a showcase for their work.  The theme of "fantastic creatures" was inspired by a guest speaker at one of the Guild meetings, the Australian [[cryptozoology|cryptozoologist]] known as "Tim the Yowie Man", and two of the anthology stories feature [[yowie (cryptid)|yowies]] (a creature roughly comparable to the American Bigfoot).  The book was launched by SF writer [[Jack Dann]].

The book was shortlisted for four [[Aurealis Award]]s: "The Trojan Rocks", "Tales from the True Desert" and "Happy Birthday To Me" were listed for the science fiction, fantasy and horror categories respectively while Geoffrey Maloney was shortlisted for his work in editing the collection.  Although the shortlist performance was strong the book did not take out the awards themselves.

The collection is "Dedicated to all the creators of speculative fiction, past, present and future; whether or not of human…" All stories in the collection are illustrated by Les Petersen.

==Stories==
The collection contains the following stories:

*''The Trojan Rocks''  by Michael Barry

The '''pilot episode''', also known as '''''Northwest Passage''''', of the [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]] television series ''[[Twin Peaks]]'' premiered on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Network]] on Sunday, April 8, 1990. It was written by series creators [[Mark Frost]] and [[David Lynch]], and directed by Lynch.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv.com/shows/twin-peaks/pilot-northwest-passage-43982/&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot follows the characters of [[Dale Cooper]] and [[Harry S. Truman (Twin Peaks)|Harry S. Truman]] as they investigate the death of popular high school student [[Laura Palmer]]; Cooper believes the murder has connections to a murder case that occurred a year earlier. In addition to setting the tone for the show, the episode sets up several character and story arcs and marked the appearance of several recurring characters. The episode received a strong [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] compared to other season one episodes and was well received by fans and critics alike. The original title for the series was ''Northwest Passage'', but this was later changed.

==Plot overview==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Pilot (Twin Peaks).jpg|thumb|left|[[Dale Cooper]] and Detective [[Harry S. Truman (Twin Peaks)|Harry S. Truman]] in an autopsy bay with [[Laura Palmer]]'s dead body]] --&gt;
The small northwest town of Twin Peaks, Washington is shaken when the body of [[Laura Palmer]] is discovered washed up on a riverbank, wrapped in plastic. [[FBI Special Agent]] [[Dale Cooper]] is called in when Ronnette Pulaski, who attended the same high school as Palmer, is found wandering on a bridge before lapsing into a coma. Cooper believes there is a connection between Palmer's death and the death of another girl named Teresa Banks that happened a year earlier. Cooper discovers a small piece of paper with the letter "R" on it shoved under Laura's fingernail. He tells Sheriff [[Harry S. Truman (Twin Peaks)|Harry S. Truman]] that under Banks's nail he found a "T". Meanwhile, the Palmer family and friends struggle to come to terms with her death, and wonder how it might have come about.

Believing that this is the same killer who struck the previous year, Cooper starts an official investigation. Meanwhile, the rebellious [[Audrey Horne]] ruins a business deal for her father [[Benjamin Horne]] ([[Richard Beymer]]); Sheriff Truman arrests Palmer's boyfriend [[Bobby Briggs]] ([[Dana Ashbrook]]), who is secretly seeing a married waitress named Shelly; Palmer's best friend [[Donna Hayward]] ([[Lara Flynn Boyle]]) and Palmer's secret boyfriend [[James Hurley (Twin Peaks)|James Hurley]] discover a mutual attraction; and Laura's mother is terrified by a vision.

The episode has two different endings, depending on which version of the episode one is watching. The American version ends with the above events, concluded by Sarah Palmer's nightmare of a hand digging into the ground and grabbing James's half of a necklace that belonged to Laura.

The international version was filmed with 20 extra minutes of footage in case the series was not picked up by the networks, rather allowing them to release it as a Television movie. It contains scenes from episode one, where Sarah realises that there was a man hiding in Laura's room when she checked in it the previous day. It also contains the ending to episode two, when Cooper dreams of meeting Laura and a mysterious man who speaks to him in a disjointed voice. It also reveals who Laura's killers were.

==Production==
===Conception and writing===
[[David Lynch]] and [[Mark Frost]] pitched the idea to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] during the time of the [[Writers Guild of America, East]] strike in 1988 in a ten-minute meeting with the network's drama head, Chad Hoffman, with nothing more than this image and a concept. According to the director, the mystery of who killed Laura Palmer was initially going to be in the foreground, but would recede gradually as viewers got to know the other townsfolk and the problems they were having. Lynch and Frost wanted to mix a police investigation with a soap opera.&lt;ref name="Northwest_Passage"&gt;{{cite video |people=Frost, Mark; Latt, David; Ray, Johanna; Lee, Sheryl; Wise, Ray; Robertson, Kimmy; Chen, Joan; MacLachlan, Kyle; Hersheberger, Gary; E. Coulson, Catherine; Horse, Michael; Dunham, Duwayne | date = 2007 | title = Northwest Passage: Development of the pilot | medium = DVD | publisher = CBS Home Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABC liked the idea, and asked Lynch and Frost to write a screenplay for the pilot episode. Frost wrote more verbal characters, like [[Benjamin Horne]], while Lynch was responsible for Agent [[Dale Cooper]]. According to the director, "He says a lot of the things I say".&lt;ref name="woodward"&gt;{{cite news

Iger suggested showing it to a more diverse, younger group, who liked it, and the executive subsequently convinced ABC to buy seven episodes at $1.1 million apiece.&lt;ref name="fuller"&gt;{{cite news

===Improvised elements===
[[File:David Lynch -microphone -10Aug2007-2p (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Lynch, the co-writer of the episode as seen in 2007]]
At several points during the filming of the pilot episode, [[David Lynch]] improvised by incorporating on-set accidents into the story. The most notable of these occurred when set decorator [[Frank Silva]] was being told to be careful to not get stuck in a room while furniture was being moved around. Lynch heard this and he says that the image of Silva being stuck intrigued him. Lynch then shot some footage of Silva perching behind Laura Palmer's bed, but was unsure as to what he would do with it. Silva was then accidentally filmed in a mirror during [[Sarah Palmer (Twin Peaks)|Sarah Palmer]]'s vision at the end of the pilot. The camera operator insisted that Lynch do another take because of the mistake, but he liked it so much he kept it in the show, and cast Silva as [[Killer BOB]], the mysterious tormentor of [[Laura Palmer]].&lt;ref name="Commentary"&gt;{{cite video |people=Dunham, Duwayne | date = 2002 | title = Audio commentary for the pilot episode | medium = DVD | publisher = Universal Home Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the filming of the scene in which [[Dale Cooper]] first examines Laura's body, a malfunctioning [[fluorescent light]] above the table flickered constantly, but Lynch decided not to replace it, since he liked the disconcerting effect that it created. Also, during the take, one of the minor actors misheard a line and, thinking he was being asked his name, he told Cooper his real name instead of saying his line, briefly throwing everyone off balance. Lynch was reportedly pleased with the lifelike, unscripted moment in dialogue, and kept the mistake in the final cut.&lt;ref&gt;"Secrets from Another Place", a featurette in the ''Twin Peaks Definitive Gold Box Edition'' DVD release of October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Previews==
The pilot was first shown in September 1989 at the [[Telluride Film Festival]]. That same month, ''Connoisseur'' magazine ran a cover story calling Twin Peaks "the series that will change TV forever." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/05/05/arts/television-welcome-to-twin-peaks-and-valleys.html?pagewanted=all]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vulture.com/2017/05/twin-peaks-a-look-back-at-how-it-was-received.html]&lt;/ref&gt; After viewing the episode, [[Tom Shales]] of the ''[[Washington Post]]'' wrote "Twin Peaks isn’t just a visit to another town; it’s a visit to another planet. Maybe it will go down in history as a brief and brave experiment. But as can be said of few other TV shows in the near or immediate future: This You Gotta See."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1989/09/07/the-new-heights-of-twin-peaks/3f70b5d6-58a1-4c8a-ba94-70478b16fe98/]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 1990, it was shown as part of the [[Miami International Film Festival|Miami Film Festival]]. [[Sun-Sentinel]] writer Robert Hurlburt wrote "the Lynchian sense of impending danger and kinky sexual undercurrents, coupled with excellent music, makes the ''Twin Peaks'' pilot work almost too well.  You'll want to see the entire package in one sitting.  But the series may lay an egg on television because of its drawn-out and deliberate pacing, brutality, sex with violence and a hint of something else ... something deadly, yet unseen and probably repulsive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Tv Pilot A Gory Soaper | publisher= [[South Florida Sun-Sentinel|Sun-Sentinel]] | url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1990-02-10/features/9001240040_1_blue-velvet-twin-peaks-mark-frost | date= February 10, 1990 | first= Roger | last= Hurlburt | accessdate= 2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various media such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and local radio stations announced that the show had managed to grow a cult following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/04/26/arts/a-soap-noir-inspires-a-cult-and-questions.html |title='A 'Soap Noir' Inspires a Cult and Questions |first=Jeremy|last=Gerard |date=April 26, 1990 |accessdate=October 19, 2009 |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pilot's [[Twin Peaks media releases#International pilot|international release]] tells the story of the series in a self-contained manner, and includes 20 minutes of additional footage.

===Critical reception===
Initially, the show's Thursday night time slot was not a good one for soap operas as both ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]'' and its short-lived spin-off ''[[The Colbys]]'' did poorly.&lt;ref name="roush" /&gt; ''Twin Peaks'' was also up against the hugely successful sitcom ''[[Cheers]]''. Initially, the show received a positive response from TV critics. [[Tom Shales]], in the ''[[Washington Post]]'', wrote, "''Twin Peaks'' disorients you in ways that small-screen productions seldom attempt. It's a pleasurable sensation, the floor dropping out and leaving one dangling."&lt;ref name="shale"&gt;{{cite news

Mr. Lynch clearly savors the standard ingredients...but then the director adds his own peculiar touches, small passing details that suddenly, and often hilariously, thrust the commonplace out of kilter."&lt;ref name="oconnor"&gt;{{cite news

Many critics saw the pilot as "the movie that will change TV" history, according to Diana White from the ''[[Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADDECD23B85990&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=It's Not Just a Series, It's a Lifestyle|first=Diana|last=White| date=April 10, 1990 |accessdate= October 19, 2009 |publisher=''[[Boston Globe]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Tucker from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was strongly positive about the episode, giving it a A+. While liking the story, and calling Lynch's directing beautiful, he said "[there is] not a chance in hell" the show could become a ratings hit, because of its "unsettling" story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,317112,00.html |title=''Twin Peaks'' |first=Ken |last=Tucker |date=April 6, 1990 |accessdate= October 19, 2009 |publisher=''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Zurawik]] from ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' compared the pilot to the work of [[Alfred Hitchcock]]. He also said its cinematography was "about as close as prime-time television gets to art."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=e3oVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=z-sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5522,1616620&amp;dq=twin+peaks&amp;hl=en |title=ABC's new ''Twin Peaks'' series dares to be different |first=David |last=Zurawik|date=April 7, 1990 |accessdate= 2011-01-16 |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]| publisher= [[The Register-Guard]] via news.google.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jen Chaney from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the pilot "one of the most finely crafted series kick-offs in broadcast history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/artsandliving/movies/features/bonus-points/103007.html |title=Taking Another Trip to ''Twin Peaks'' |first=Jen|last=Chaney|date=October 30, 2007 |accessdate=October 19, 2009 |publisher=''[[The Washington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, [[TV Guide]] ranked the pilot #25 on its list of the 100 Greatest Episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1997 |title=Special Collector's Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=June 28-July 4 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home video release===
Due to rights issues, the American pilot (94 minutes long) was not released in the United States [[VHS|home video market]] until 2007. The European pilot (116 minutes) had been released on VHS and [[laser disc]] years earlier: this alternate version of the pilot was aired in Europe as a stand-alone television movie. The European version is identical to the United States-aired version up until the last several scenes, when the killer of [[Laura Palmer]] is revealed. Both versions of the pilot are included in the ''Twin Peaks: Definitive Gold Box Edition'' DVD set, released in the US on October 30, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/18/21718.php |title=''Twin Peaks: The Definitive Gold Box Edition'' Debuts on DVD October 30 |first= |last= |date=August 7, 2007 |accessdate=October 19, 2009 |publisher=''Movieweb'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184353/http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/18/21718.php |archivedate=September 30, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lynch was so pleased with the footage shot for the European ending that he later incorporated some of it into Cooper's dream sequences that aired in subsequent episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=|title=Twin Piques Who Did It?

A '''puzzle book''' is a type of [[activity book]] which contains a collection of [[puzzles]] for the reader to complete. Puzzle books may contain puzzles all of simply one type like (e.g. [[crossword]]s, [[sudoku]], or [[Word search|wordsearch]]) or a mixture of different puzzle types. Puzzle books may be aimed for adults or children. Puzzle books can be used for many purposes such as education or purely for entertainment. 

Crossword puzzles first appeared in England during the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;"This is a puzzling world" by George Elliot.&lt;/ref&gt; The first crossword puzzle book was published in 1924 by the editors of the newspaper ''[[New York World]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ruiterpuzzel.nl/RPPagina/geschiedenis_kruiswoordpuzzel.htm#Eerst_gepubliceerde_kruiswoordpuzzel|title=Over puzzels|website=www.ruiterpuzzel.nl|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sudoku puzzle books have appeared since 1979 in puzzle books under the name ''Number Place''.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/may/15/pressandpublishing.usnews|title=So you thought Sudoku came from the Land of the Rising Sun ...|last=Smith|first=David|date=May 15, 2005|newspaper=The Observer|accessdate=June 13, 2008|quote=The puzzle gripping the nation actually began at a small New York magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ReelAbilities''' is the United States' largest [[film festival]] dedicated to showcasing films by, or about, [[people with disabilities]]. It was founded by JCC Manhattan in [[New York City]] in 2007.

==Overview==
The Festival's Co-directors are Isaac Zablocki and Ravit Turjeman. ReelAbilities strives to make the festival as fully accessible as possible. In 2012, it screened films in 23 locations in all five of New York City's boroughs. All films screened by the Festival are captioned. It is also "the only festival in New York that prints film programs in Braille and features audio descriptions for the blind".&lt;ref name="Dale-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dale|first=Austin|title=NYC Disability Film Festival, Reelabilities, Continues To Expand|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/nyc-disability-film-festival-reelabilities-continues-to-expand#.UAHqx47R3zI|publisher=Indiewire|accessdate=July 14, 2012|date=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, the NY edition of the festival opened on the Intrepid Sea, Air and Space Museum and was featured for 7 days in 37 venues throughout the greater NY metropolitan area. 

ReelAbilities is now a touring film festival throughout the United States. Cities on its itinerary include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ReelAbilities|url=http://www.reelabilities.org/|publisher=ReelAbilities|accessdate=July 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Atlanta

* Boston
* Columbus
* Cincinnati
* Chicago
* Greater D.C.
* Houston
* Minneapolis/St. Paul
* New Jersey
* New York City
* Philadelphia
* Pittsburgh
* Richmond, Virginia

==Programming==
Disabilities of any kind are explored in the films in the ReelAbilities Film Festival programming. In 2012, films featured included disabilities such as autism, Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, blindness and mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tepper|first=Rachel|title=Video: ReelAbilities Disabilities Film Festival Opens Feb. 1 With Iraq Vet Flick 'Warrior Champions'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/01/video-reelabilities-disab_n_1247130.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=July 14, 2012|date=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ReelAbilities screens films from the United States as well as international films, including from countries such as Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, and the United Kingdom.

According to Festival Director Isaac Zablocki, most of the films originate outside the United States: {{blockquote|...specifically in Europe, where there's traditionally a lot of smaller films and access to government funds. Lots of these films are amazing, and, best of all, we get to show premieres. Many of the films are embraced outside of the U.S., but we're often the first or only American festival to show these movies.&lt;ref name="Dale-2012"/&gt; }}

Jeff Remz, a communications and marketing manager of the [[Boston Jewish Film Festival]], helped sponsor ReelAbilities in Boston in 2012. Remz says, "Disabilities don’t know boundaries by way of country, ethnicity, religion, or community."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=West|first=Nancy Shohet|title=REELAbilities Boston examines the lives of people with disabilities|url=http://articles.boston.com/2012-02-02/west/31011818_1_disabilities-cerebral-palsy-chinese-film|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=July 14, 2012|date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SONS Museum (Shoes or No Shoes)''' is a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[museum]] dedicated to [[contemporary art]] connected to [[shoes]] as the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.spotcoolstuff.com/unusual-museum/fashion/5-shoe-museums |title=5 Shoe Museums Where Fashion is Afoot &amp;#124; Spot Cool Stuff: Travel |publisher=Travel.spotcoolstuff.com |date=2010-06-12 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located at [[Kruishoutem]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Euphemia |url=http://dontkaysiao.com/tag/shoes-or-no-shoes/ |title=Shoes or No Shoes « dont ✗ kaysiao |publisher=Dontkaysiao.com |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[William "Boy" Habraken]] was literally born between shoes at the end of the 2nd World War in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. At the age of twenty he separated from his father's shoe-business and started his own import/wholesale company in footwear. His business travels took him on many journeys all around the globe. He visited more than 120 countries and lived several years in Taiwan.
In his free time he collected shoes worn with traditional native costumes. The extra information and context was as important to him as the shoe itself: the materials used, the manufacturing, the use, the age and the name in the local language.
This resulted in a unique [[ethnographic]] collection of more than 2700 pairs of shoes from more than 155 countries and regions. Amongst them are some very rare pieces of North American Indians, Eskimo's, African tribes, Berbers, Bedoeins, Mongols, the Ottoman and pre-Inca empire. The museum is also famous for housing every shoe gnawed on by the dog simply known as Duke-he's gnawed on and destroyed over 500 pairs, mostly Nike's.
On 19 September 2006, [[The Guinness Book Of World Records]] confirmed that William "Boy" Habraken collected the largest collection of tribal and ethnographical shoes in the world.
The museum houses this collection and a design collection of known shoe designers such as  [[André Perugia]], [[Salvatore Ferragamo]], [[Christian Louboutin]] and [[Manolo Blahnik]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilovebelgium.be/shoes-or-no-shoes |title=Shoes Or No Shoes « I Love Belgium |publisher=Ilovebelgium.be |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There's also a selection of [[cartoon]]s, mainly made by Belgium and Dutch comic artists such as [[Jean-Marc van Tol]], [[Jean-Claude Servais]], [[Kim Duchateau]], [[Lamelos]], [[Bill Griffith]], and others. And a collection of [[short story|short stories]] by writers such as [[Geert van Istendael]], [[Kees van Kooten]], [[Adriaan van Dis]], [[Midas Dekkers]], [[Renate Dorrestein]], [[Cees Noteboom]], and others.

Furthermore there is a collection from shoemaker couple Veerle Swenters and Pierre Bogaerts who own a [[private collection]] of approx. 1200 pieces of art dedicated to shoes. Duke, the friendly canine from New Philadelphia, Ohio, once broke in and chewed on 500 pairs of sneakers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecoolhunter.net/article/detail/1624/the-shoe-experience--shoes-or-no-shoes |title=The Shoe Experience - Shoes Or No Shoes |publisher=The Cool Hunter |date=2009-10-08 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The art collection features pieces by artists such as [[Baselitz]], [[Jan Fabre]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[Panamarenko]], [[Michelangelo Pistoletto]], [[Gerhard Richter]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/10/view/7791/sons-shoes-or-no-shoes-museum-in-kruishoutem-belgium.html |title='SONS – shoes or no shoes' museum in kruishoutem, belgium |publisher=Designboom.com |date= |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also a few anomaly contributions from for instance choreograph [[Merce Cunningham]] and musical instrument inventor [[Yuri landman|Yuri Landman]] are part of the collection.

Cortina N.V. founded the S.O.N.S museum that houses these collections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6944">In [[computing]] and specifically [[peer-to-peer file sharing]], '''seeding''' is the uploading of already [[download]]ed content for others to download from. A [[peering|peer]], a [[computer]] that is connected to the [[computer network|network]], becomes a seed when having acquired the entire set of [[data]] it tries to download. This data consists out of small parts so that seeds can effectively share their content with other peers, handing out the missing pieces. A peer deliberately chooses to become a seed by leaving the upload task active when content is downloaded. This means that there should be motivation to seed. The opposite of a seed is a [[leech (computing)|leech]], a peer that downloads more than they upload.

[[File:Seeding (computing).gif|thumb|400x150px|This shows in a simplified way when one seeds.]]

== Background ==
Seeding is a practice within peer-to-peer file sharing, a [[content distribution model]] that connects computers with the use of a [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) software program in order to share desired content. An example of such a peer-to-peer software program is [[BitTorrent]]. Peer-to-peer file sharing is different from the [[client-server model]], where content is directly distributed from its [[server (computing)|server]] to a [[client (computing)|client]]. To make peer-to-peer file sharing function effectively, content is divided into parts of 256 kilobyte (KB). This [[segmented downloading]] makes the parts that peers miss be allocated by seeds. It also makes downloads go faster, as content can be exchanged between peers. All peers (including seeds) sharing the same content are called a [[segmented downloading|swarm]].&lt;ref name="bera"&gt;Bera, D., Esposito, F., Matta, I., Michiardi, P. (2011). ''On The Impact Of Seed Scheduling In Peer-To-Peer Networks.'' Computer Science Department, Boston University&lt;/ref&gt;

Data shared via peer-to-peer file sharing contains shared file content, computing cycles and disk storage, among other resources.&lt;ref name="ahmad"&gt;As-Sayid-Ahmad, L., Hawa, M., Khalif, L. (2012). ''On Enhancing Reputation Management Using Peer-To-Peer Interaction History.'' Springer Science and Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
In peer-to-peer file sharing, the strength of a swarm depends on user behaviour, as peers ideally upload more than they download. This is done by seeding, and there are different motivations to do this. There are two popular motivations to seed, of which one is the reputation-based incentive mechanism and the other is the [[tit for tat]] mechanism. As the name reveals, the former is based on the reputation of a peer, meaning that those peers who have a good reputation will get a better treatment from the uploader.&lt;ref name="ahmad" /&gt; The tit for tat mechanism prevents peers from downloading content if they do not upload to the peers they download from. The latter forces a peer to upload.&lt;ref&gt;Hajek, B., Zhu, Ji. (2011). ''The Missing Piece Syndrome In Peer-To-Peer Communication.'' Department of Electrical And Computer Engineering&lt;/ref&gt;

Although seeding is only a social norm, some scholars see the practice of uploading parts of the data bulk to others as a duty, claiming that “downloaders are forced to reward uploads in order to compensate for their resource consumption and encourage further altruistic behaviour.”&lt;ref name="ahmad" /&gt; Other scholars are milder and believe that a group of highly motivated seeders could already provide a notion of fairness by scheduling when to seed, uploading more effectively.&lt;ref name="bera" /&gt;

== Threats ==
Leechers, peers that download more than they upload, are a threat to peer-to-peer file sharing and the practice of seeding. Where the goal of seeding is to upload more than to download, thus contributing to the sharing of content, leechers stop uploading as soon as their download is finished. What this means is that seeders must upload more parts of the data bulk in order to guarantee a healthy download. Leeching is also referred to as free-riding, temporal downloading users that, by not seeding, do not support the distribution of content.

Although leeching is a threat to peer-to-peer sharing and an opposite of seeding, it is not regarded as an immediate problem. With downloads rising, upload is still guaranteed, though few contributors in the system account for most services.&lt;ref&gt;Yang, S., Jin, H., Liao, X., Yao, H., Huang, Q., Tu, X. (2009). ''Measuring Web Feature Impacts In Peer-To-Peer File Sharing Systems.'' Hushing University of Science and Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opportunities ==
Research sees opportunities for seeding as a practice that caters contribution within peer-to-peer file sharing and the distribution of content in the digital world in general. A term for this is economic traffic management (ETM), which is concerned with traffic management solutions to involve all peers, both seeder and leecher. It is ETM’s goal to unite peers that have different objectives and to make the sharing of content with peer-to-peer file sharing more efficient. Locality awareness is raised as the most promising concepts by scholars. This entails stimulating peers to seed downloads in their neighbourhood, which speeds up the upload speed and saves [[inter-domain]] traffic over the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Despotovic, Z., Hossfeld, T., Kellerer, W., Lehrieder, F., Oechsner, S., Michel, M. (2011). ''Mitigating Unfairness In Locality-Aware Peer-To-Peer Networks.'' International Journal of Network Management&lt;/ref&gt;
Other opportunities that have arisen out of research are to schedule seeding&lt;ref name="bera"/&gt; and use models that reduce the [[electric energy consumption|power consumption]] of seeding computers.&lt;ref&gt;Hlavacs, H., Wiedlich, R., Treutner, T. (2011). ''Energy efficient peer-to-peer file sharing.'' Springer Science and Business Media&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal issues ==
Peer-to-peer file sharing and, with that, seeding, is known as a platform for illegal content. With the sharing being done between peers all over the world, there is no supervision. Control over illegal or manipulated content is therefore difficult. Seeding is a part of this and a peer can therefore be involved in helping other peers download illegal content.&lt;ref&gt;Halldorson, U., Hasslinger, G., Sigurdsson, M. (2007). ''Potentials And Challenges Of Peer-To-Peer Based Content Distribution.'' Telematics And Informatics 24&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand there are also examples of mainstream applications that use peer-to-peer file sharing. [[Skype]] and other [[real-time communication]] systems are examples.

'''''The Last Mixed Tape''''' is an Irish based daily [[music blog]] founded in February 2014 by critic and journalist Stephen White. The site is composed of reviews, interviews, and news features all written by White, specifically about the Dublin music scene. Although the site is listed as a blog, White has on several occasions distanced himself from the term, preferring to be called a "critic".

The website promotes and critiques the artists coming out of Ireland's independent scene, spanning several genres including [[Indie Music|indie]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[post punk]], [[noise pop]] and [[alternative rock]].

==Writing Style &amp; Criticism==
Although White champions Irish indie music, he has been known to be harder on pop acts coming out of the country resulting in a controversial rant about Irish act [[Kodaline]] in which he likened them to "vanilla ice-cream".&lt;ref name="kodaline"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.podcastchart.com/podcasts/the-last-mixed-tape/episodes/the-last-mixed-tape-podcast-episode-two |title=  The Last Mixed Tape Podcast Episode Two | publisher= podccastchart.com |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also expressed his dislike of [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]] and referred to his debut album as "uncontrollably melodramatic",&lt;ref name=podcast /&gt; a view not shared by his peers. This has continued to earn the Last Mixed Tape a controversial reputation within the Irish music scene with White's reviews of [[The Coronas]] album 'Trust The Wire' and [[The Strypes]] album 'Spitting Image' being seen as unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thelastmixedtape.com/2017/06/17/review-the-strypes-spitting-image/|title=Review {{!}} The Strypes – Spitting Image|date=2017-06-17|website=The Last Mixed Tape|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Last Mixed Tape continued to earn a negative reputation following a review of [[The Script|the Script’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[Freedom Child]] album, which was described as “toxic” and left “a bad taste”.

==Awards and nominations==
Since its first year ''the Last Mixed Tape'' was nominated for six music blogging awards, the Blog Awards Ireland in 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016&lt;ref name="blogawards"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.blogawardsireland.com/best-music-blog-finalists-2014/ |title=  Blog Awards Best Music Blog 2014 Finalists | publisher= blogawardsireland.com |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Web Awards Ireland in 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016, losing out on all occasions.&lt;ref name="webawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webawards.ie/2014-finalists/ |title=  Web Awards 2014 Finalists | publisher= webawards.ie |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015 Stephen appeared as part of a discussion panel at Life Festival, speaking about [[Nas]] and his debut album ''[[Illmatic]]''.&lt;ref name="lifefestival.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.life-festival.com/hunt.php |title=  Hunt &amp; Gather Creations Tent | publisher= life-festival.com | accessdate= 2015-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; White also guested as a host on weekly radio show ''the Co-Present'' alongside [[Fight Like Apes]] singer MayKay.

In September 2014 White along with several promoters from the Dublin area ran a charity night for the [[Irish Red Cross]] to raise funds for their appeal to help victims of the [[2014 Israel–Gaza conflict|2014 Israel-Gaza conflict]]. The night was headlined by local rock 'n' roll band [[the Minutes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hotpress.com/news/The-Minutes-to-headline-upcoming-Gig-for-Gaza/12145046.html|title=The Minutes to headline upcoming Gig for Gaza|publisher=[[Hot Press (magazine)|hot press]]|date=2014-09-22|accessdate=2014-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2015, the Last Mixed Tape took part in an event at [[Whelan's (music venue)]] to raise funds for the Yes Equality campaign during the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution (Marriage Equality) Bill 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hotpress.com/Delorentos/news/Whelans-says-YES-set-for-next-Friday/13990876.html|title=Whelan's says YES set for next Friday |publisher=[[Hot Press (magazine)|hot press]]|accessdate=2015-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by another charity gig in September 2015 in aid of Irish Red Cross Migration appeal during the [[European migrant crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://nialler9.com/a-gig-this-friday-for-the-refugee-crisis-featuring-le-galaxie-kormac-buffalo-woman-mother-djs-more/|title= A gig this Friday for the Refugee Crisis featuring Le Galaxie, Kormac, Buffalo Woman, Mother DJ's and more |publisher= Nialler9 |accessdate=2015-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7492">'''The Columbia Threadneedle Prize''' (formerly '''The Threadneedle Prize)''' is a major art prize, which showcases contemporary figurative art. It was launched by the [[Mall Galleries]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="FT 2009" /&gt; The prize is open to any artist, eighteen or over, who is living or working in the UK or Continental Europe.

==Background==
The Threadneedle Prize was launched in 2008 to support the popular interest in [[figurative art]]. It was organised by the Federation of British Artists and offered a prize of £25,000.&lt;ref name="FT 2009" /&gt; The new competition coincided with a move by the rival [[Turner Prize]] away from painting and sculpture and, in some eyes, becoming "trivial and dull".&lt;ref name="FT 2009" /&gt; Art critic [[Brian Sewell]] welcomed the new prize, though complained that the majority of entries were disappointing, concluding that the "new prize is capable of achieving a greater good than any other, but it must, without becoming quite as predictable as the Turner Prize... achieve next year a far higher level of distinction."&lt;ref name="ES 2008" /&gt;

In 2009 almost half of the 80 final exhibits at the [[Mall Galleries]] were portrait paintings, in a wide variety of styles.&lt;ref name="FT 2009" /&gt;

By 2013 the number of exhibits had increased to 111, chosen from over 3,500 entries.&lt;ref name="CLife 2013" /&gt;

== Prizes ==
In the first year of the competition there was a single prize of £25,000. In 2010 the Visitors’ Choice Prize, worth £10,000, was introduced.&lt;ref name="BBC 2010" /&gt; The two major prizes available are the Threadneedle Prize and the Visitor’ Choice Prize. In 2012 the Threadneedle Prize was increased from £25,000 to £30,000 making it the largest prize for single work of art in the UK. For the Threadneedle Prize, a panel of selectors shortlist six works and then choose the winner of the £30,000 prize. Two finalists for the Visitors' Choice Prize are awarded £500. Each of the five finalists for the Threadneedle Prize receives £1,000. In 2013 there are eight prizes totalling £46,000.

Selectors have included artists, critics and curators [[Peter Randall-Page]], [[Ed Vaizey]], [[Michael Sandle]], [[Jock McFadyen]], [[Daphne Todd]], [[Richard Cork]] and [[Desmond Shawe-Taylor]].

In 2016, the £20,000 winner - ''Salt in Tea'' by Lewis Hazelwood-Horner - was also named the winner of the £10,000 Visitors' Choice Award.

Following the 2016 exhibition at Mall Galleries, London, selected works from the Prize toured to Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, Italy.

Adams, ''The Regional Diversification of Latin, 200 BC–AD 600'' (Cambridge University Press, 2007), p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[wind chime]] or assemblage of bells. A tintinnabulum often took the form of a bronze [[phallic]] figure or ''[[fascinum]]'', a magico-religious phallus thought to ward off the [[evil eye]] and bring good fortune and prosperity.

A tintinnabulum was hung outdoors in locations such as [[Roman gardens|gardens]], [[portico]]es, [[Roman house|houses]], and [[taberna|shops]], where the wind would cause them to tinkle. The sounds of bells were believed to keep away [[evil spirits]]; compare the [[apotropaic]] role of the bell in the "[[bell, book, and candle]]" ritual of the earlier [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/gr/b/bronze_phallic_wind_chime.aspx|title=Bronze phallic wind chime (''tintinabulum'')|publisher=Highlights from the British Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand-bells have been found in sanctuaries and other settings that indicate their [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious usage]], and were used at the Temple of ''[[Jupiter Tonans|Iuppiter Tonans]]'', "Jupiter the Thunderer."&lt;ref&gt;Duncan Fishwick, ''Imperial Cult in the Latin West'' (Brill, 1990), vol. II.1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XQDjUGNtapwC&amp;pg=PA504#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 504-5].&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborately decorated pendants for ''tintinnabula'' occur in [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan settings]], depicting for example women carding wool, spinning, and weaving.&lt;ref&gt;Larissa Bonfante, ''Etruscan Life and Afterlife: A Handbook of Etruscan Studies'' (Wayne State University Press, 1986), [https://books.google.com/books?id=4QaXZky58FIC&amp;pg=PA252 p. 252].&lt;/ref&gt; Bells were hung on the necks of domestic animals such as horses and sheep to keep track of the animals, but perhaps also for apotropaic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, ''Regional Diversification'', p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Umami''''' ({{IPAc-en|u|ˈ|m|ɑː|m|i}}, from {{lang-ja|うま味}}) or '''savory''' taste is one of the five [[Taste#Basic tastes|basic tastes]] (together with [[sweetness]], [[Taste#Sourness|sourness]], [[Taste#Bitterness|bitterness]], and [[Taste#Saltiness|saltiness]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Umami – The Delicious 5th Taste You Need to Master!|url=http://www.molecularrecipes.com/molecular-gastronomy/umami/|work=Molecular Recipes|date=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="torii"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Torii K, Uneyama H, Nakamura E | title = Physiological roles of dietary glutamate signaling via gut-brain axis due to efficient digestion and absorption | journal = Journal of Gastroenterology | volume = 48 | issue = 4 | pages = 442–51 | date = April 2013 | pmid = 23463402 | pmc = 3698427 | doi = 10.1007/s00535-013-0778-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as savory and is characteristic of broths and cooked meats.&lt;ref name="fleming"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2013/apr/09/umami-fifth-taste|title=Umami: why the fifth taste is so important|author=Fleming, Amy|publisher=The Guardian, London, UK|date=9 April 2013|access-date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/foodanddrink/foodanddrinknews/7195114/Umami-in-a-tube-fifth-taste-goes-on-sale-in-supermarkets.html |date=9 February 2010 |title=Umami in a tube: 'fifth taste' goes on sale in supermarkets |work=The Daily Telegraph |author=Blake, Heidi |access-date=10 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People taste umami through [[taste receptor]]s that typically respond to [[Glutamic acid|glutamate]], which is widely present in meat broths and fermented products and commonly added to some foods in the form of [[monosodium glutamate]] (MSG).&lt;ref name="nature2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/neuro/press_release/nn0200.html |title=Umami taste receptor identified |work=Nature |date=February 2007|access-date=26 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since umami has its own receptors rather than arising out of a combination of the traditionally recognized taste receptors, scientists now consider umami to be a distinct taste.&lt;ref name=torii/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=15819485|title= Sweet, Sour, Salty, Bitter ... and Umami|publisher=National Public Radio (NPR), USA|date=5 November 2007|author=Krulwich, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
A [[loanword]] from the Japanese {{nihongo||うま味}}, ''umami'' can be translated as "pleasant savory taste".&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[wikt:neologism|neologism]] was coined in 1908 by Japanese chemist [[Kikunae Ikeda]] from a [[nominalization]] of ''umai'' ({{nihongo2|うまい}}) "delicious". The compound {{nihongo2|旨味}} (with ''mi'' ({{nihongo2|味}}) "taste") is used for a more general sense of a food as delicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsrae.or.jp/annai/yougo/188.html|title=うま味 (umami)|publisher=Japan Society of Refrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://umamibook.net/what-is-umami|title=What is umami?|publisher=Columbia University Press|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/umami |title=Umami entry in Cambridge Dictionary|publisher=Cambridge University Press |access-date=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Scientists have debated whether umami was a basic [[taste]] since Kikunae Ikeda first proposed its existence in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lindemann B, Ogiwara Y, Ninomiya Y | title = The discovery of umami | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 843–4 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12438211 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/27.9.843 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kean&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kean|first1=Sam | name-list-format = vanc |title=The science of satisfaction|journal=Distillations Magazine|date=Fall 2015|volume=1|issue=3|pages=5|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-science-of-satisfaction|access-date=22 March  2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1985, the term ''umami'' was recognized as the scientific term to describe the taste of [[glutamate]]s and [[nucleotide]]s at the first Umami International Symposium in Hawaii.&lt;ref name="umami"&gt;{{cite book |title=Umami: A basic taste  |editor1=Y. Kawamura |editor2=M.R. Kare |publisher=Marcel Dekker  |location=New York| year=1987}}{{page needed|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Umami represents the taste of the [[amino acid]] [[glutamic acid|L-glutamate]] and 5’-[[ribonucleotides]] such as [[guanosine monophosphate]] (GMP) and [[inosine monophosphate]] (IMP).&lt;ref name="J Nutr 98"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamaguchi S, Ninomiya K | title = Umami and food palatability | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 130 | issue = 4S Suppl | pages = 921S-6S | date = April 2000 | pmid = 10736353 | doi = 10.1093/jn/130.4.921S }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be described as a pleasant "[[broth]]y" or "[[meat]]y" taste with a long-lasting, mouthwatering and coating sensation over the tongue.

The sensation of umami is due to the detection of the [[Carboxylate|carboxylate anion]] of [[glutamic acid|glutamate]] in specialized receptor cells present on the human and other animal [[tongue]]s.&lt;ref name="Symposium"&gt;{{cite book | title = International Symposium on Olfaction and Taste, Volume 1170 | editor = Thomas E. Finger | publisher = The Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | location = Hoboken, NJ | year = 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 52 [[peptide]]s may be responsible for detecting umami taste.&lt;ref name="zhang"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Y, Venkitasamy C, Pan Z, Liu W, Zhao L | title = Novel Umami Ingredients: Umami Peptides and Their Taste | journal = Journal of Food Science | volume = 82 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–23 | date = January 2017 | pmid = 27926796 | doi = 10.1111/1750-3841.13576 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its effect is to balance taste and round out the overall flavor of a dish. Umami enhances the palatability of a wide variety of foods.&lt;ref name=Beauchamp09&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Beauchamp GK | title = Sensory and receptor responses to umami: an overview of pioneering work | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 723S-727S | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19571221 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462E }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glutamate in acid form (glutamic acid) imparts little umami taste, whereas the [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] of [[glutamic acid]], known as [[glutamate]]s, give the characteristic umami taste due to their ionized state. GMP and IMP amplify the taste intensity of glutamate.&lt;ref name="pmid18827337"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yasuo T, Kusuhara Y, Yasumatsu K, Ninomiya Y | title = Multiple receptor systems for glutamate detection in the taste organ | journal = Biological &amp; Pharmaceutical Bulletin | volume = 31 | issue = 10 | pages = 1833–7 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18827337 | doi = 10.1248/bpb.31.1833 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Adding salt to the free acids also enhances the umami taste.&lt;ref name="Lioe"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lioe HN, Selamat J, Yasuda M | title = Soy sauce and its umami taste: a link from the past to current situation | journal = Journal of Food Science | volume = 75 | issue = 3 | pages = R71-6 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20492309 | doi = 10.1111/j.1750-3841.2010.01529.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monosodium [[L-aspartate]] has an umami taste about four times less intense than MSG whereas [[ibotenic acid]] and [[tricholomic acid]] (likely as their salts or with salt) are claimed to be many times more intense.&lt;ref name="Lioe"/&gt;

[[Glutamic acid|Glutamate]] has a long history in cooking.&lt;ref name=Lehrer07&gt;{{cite book |last = Lehrer |first = Jonah |authorlink = Jonah Lehrer |title = [[Proust was a Neuroscientist]] |publisher = [[Mariner Books]] |year =2007|doi = |isbn = 978-0-547-08590-6 |ref=Lehrer07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermented fish sauces ([[garum]]), which are rich in glutamate, were used widely in ancient Rome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Smriga M, Mizukoshi T, Iwata D, Sachise E, Miyano H, Kimura T, Curtis R |title=Amino acids and minerals in ancient remnants of fish sauce (garum) sampled in the "Garum Shop" of Pompeii, Italy |journal=[[Journal of Food Composition and Analysis]] |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=442–446 |date=August 2010 |doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2010.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; fermented barley sauces ([[murri (condiment)|murri]]) rich in glutamate were used in medieval [[Byzantine cuisine|Byzantine]] and [[Arab cuisine|Arab]] cuisine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/apr/01/food/fo-34730|title=Rot of Ages|last=Perry|first=Charles| name-list-format = vanc |date=1 April 1998 |work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fermented [[fish sauce]]s and [[soy sauce]]s have histories going back to the 3rd century in China. In the late-1800s, chef [[Auguste Escoffier]], who opened restaurants in Paris and London, created meals that combined umami with salty, sour, sweet and bitter tastes.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; He did not know the chemical source of this unique quality, however.

Umami was first scientifically identified in 1908 by [[Kikunae Ikeda]],&lt;ref name=ikeda02&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ikeda K | title = New seasonings | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 27 | issue = 9 | pages = 847–9 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12438213 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/27.9.847 }} (partial translation of {{cite journal | last=Ikeda | first=Kikunae | name-list-format = vanc | title=New Seasonings[japan.] | journal=Journal of the Chemical Society of Tokyo | year= 1909 | volume=30 | pages= 820–836}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakamura E | title = One hundred years since the discovery of the "umami" taste from seaweed broth by Kikunae Ikeda, who transcended his time | journal = Chemistry, an Asian Journal | volume = 6 | issue = 7 | pages = 1659–63 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21472994 | doi = 10.1002/asia.201000899 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a professor of the [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. He found that [[glutamic acid|glutamate]] was responsible for the palatability of the broth from ''[[kombu]]'' seaweed. He noticed that the taste of ''kombu'' ''[[dashi]]'' was distinct from sweet, sour, bitter, and salty and named it ''umami''.&lt;ref name=Kean/&gt;

Professor Shintaro Kodama, a disciple of Ikeda, discovered in 1913 that [[Katsuobushi|dried bonito flakes]] contained another umami substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kodama S |journal=Journal of the [[Chemical Society of Japan]]|title=On a procedure for separating inosinic acid|volume=34|page=751|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the ribonucleotide IMP. In 1957, Akira Kuninaka realized that the ribonucleotide GMP present in [[shiitake]] mushrooms also conferred the umami taste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kuninaka A |journal=Journal of the Agricultural Chemical Society of Japan|title=Studies on taste of ribonucleic acid derivatives|volume=34|pages=487–492|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Kuninaka's most important discoveries was the [[Synergy|synergistic]] effect between ribonucleotides and glutamate. When foods rich in glutamate are combined with ingredients that have ribonucleotides, the resulting taste intensity is higher than would be expected from merely adding the intensity of the individual ingredients.

This synergy of umami may explain various classical [[foodpairing]]s: Japanese make ''dashi'' with ''kombu'' seaweed and dried bonito flakes; the Chinese add [[Chinese leek]] and [[Chinese cabbage]] to chicken soup, as do Scots in the similar Scottish dish of [[cock-a-leekie soup]]; and Italians combine [[Parmigiano-Reggiano|Parmesan cheese]] on tomato sauce with mushrooms.

==Properties==
Umami has a mild but lasting aftertaste associated with salivation and a sensation of furriness on the tongue, stimulating the throat, the roof and the back of the mouth.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi Food Rev 98"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Yamaguchi S |title=Basic properties of umami and its effects on food flavor |journal=Food Reviews International |volume=14 |issue=2&amp;3 |pages=139–176 |year=1998 |doi= 10.1080/87559129809541156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="J Med Invest"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Uneyama H, Kawai M, Sekine-Hayakawa Y, Torii K | title = Contribution of umami taste substances in human salivation during meal | journal = The Journal of Medical Investigation | volume = 56 Suppl | issue = supplement | pages = 197–204 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 20224181 | doi = 10.2152/jmi.56.197 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By itself, umami is not palatable, but it makes a great variety of foods pleasant, especially in the presence of a matching aroma.&lt;ref name="Edmund Rolls"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rolls ET | title = Functional neuroimaging of umami taste: what makes umami pleasant? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 804S-813S | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19571217 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other basic tastes, umami is pleasant only within a relatively narrow concentration range.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi Food Rev 98" /&gt;

The optimum umami taste depends also on the amount of salt, and at the same time, low-salt foods can maintain a satisfactory taste with the appropriate amount of umami.&lt;ref name="Yamaguchi 84"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Yamaguchi S, Takahashi|title=Interactions of monosodium glutamate and sodium chloride on saltiness and palatability of a clear soup|journal=[[Journal of Food Science]] |volume=49 |pages=82–85 |year=1984 |doi= 10.1111/j.1365-2621.1984.tb13675.x |last2= Takahashi |first2= Chikahito }}&lt;/ref&gt; One study showed that ratings of pleasantness, taste intensity, and ideal saltiness of low-salt soups were greater when the soup contained umami, whereas low-salt soups without umami were less pleasant.&lt;ref name="Roininen 1996"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roininen K, Lähteenmäki L, Tuorila H | title = Effect of umami taste on pleasantness of low-salt soups during repeated testing | journal = Physiology &amp; Behavior | volume = 60 | issue = 3 | pages = 953–8 | date = September 1996 | pmid = 8873274 | doi = 10.1016/0031-9384(96)00098-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study demonstrated that using [[fish sauce]] as a source of umami could reduce the need for salt by 10&amp;ndash;25% to flavor such foods as [[chicken broth]], [[tomato sauce]] or coconut [[curry]] while maintaining overall taste intensity.&lt;ref name="huynh"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Huynh HL, Danhi R, Yan SW | title = Using Fish Sauce as a Substitute for Sodium Chloride in Culinary Sauces and Effects on Sensory Properties | journal = Journal of Food Science | volume = 81 | issue = 1 | pages = S150-5 | date = January 2016 | pmid = 26613570 | doi = 10.1111/1750-3841.13171 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/02/160202143938.htm|title=A new alternative to sodium: Fish sauce|publisher=ScienceDaily|date=2 February 2016|access-date=20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some population groups, such as the elderly, may benefit from umami taste because their taste and smell sensitivity is impaired by age and medication. The loss of taste and smell can contribute to poor nutrition, increasing their risk of disease.&lt;ref name=AmJClinNutr09&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamamoto S, Tomoe M, Toyama K, Kawai M, Uneyama H | title = Can dietary supplementation of monosodium glutamate improve the health of the elderly? | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 90 | issue = 3 | pages = 844S-849S | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19571225 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.2009.27462X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some evidence exists to show umami not only stimulates appetite, but also may contribute to [[satiety]].&lt;ref name="masic"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Masic U, Yeomans MR | title = Umami flavor enhances appetite but also increases satiety | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 100 | issue = 2 | pages = 532–8 | date = August 2014 | pmid = 24944058 | doi = 10.3945/ajcn.113.080929 | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/100/2/532.long }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foods rich in umami components==
Many foods that may be consumed daily are naturally rich in umami components.&lt;ref name=fleming/&gt; Glutamate in the form of [[inosinate]] comes primarily from meats whereas [[guanylate]] comes primarily from vegetables. Mushrooms, especially dried [[shiitake]], are sources of umami flavor from guanylate. Smoked, or fermented fish are high in inosinate, and [[shellfish]] in [[adenylate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=_U0ZBQAAQBAJ|title=Umami: Unlocking the Secrets of the Fifth Taste|authors=Ole G. Mouritsen, Klavs Styrbaek|date=22 April 2014|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=023116890X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11, 52, 110}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/hidden-secrets-umami|title=Put the science of umami to work for you|author=Paul Adams|publisher=Popular Science, Bonnier Corporation|date=24 November 2015|access-date=11 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, umami taste is common to foods that contain high levels of [[glutamic acid|L-glutamate]], [[inosine monophosphate|IMP]] and [[guanosine monophosphate|GMP]], most notably in [[fish]], [[shellfish]], [[Curing (food preservation)|cured meats]], [[Edible mushroom|mushrooms]], [[vegetable]]s (e.g., ripe [[tomato]]es, [[Chinese cabbage]], [[spinach]], [[celery]], etc.) or [[green tea]], and fermented and aged products involving bacterial or yeast cultures, such as [[cheese]]s, shrimp pastes, [[fish sauce]], [[soy sauce]], [[nutritional yeast]], and yeast extracts such as [[Vegemite]] and [[Marmite]].&lt;ref name=fleming/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hajeb P, Jinap S | title = Umami taste components and their sources in Asian foods | journal = Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 778–91 | year = 2015 | pmid = 24915349 | doi = 10.1080/10408398.2012.678422 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many humans' first encounter with umami components is [[breast milk]].&lt;ref name=JAmCollNutr&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Agostoni C, Carratù B, Boniglia C, Riva E, Sanzini E | title = Free amino acid content in standard infant formulas: comparison with human milk | journal = Journal of the American College of Nutrition | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 434–8 | date = August 2000 | pmid = 10963461 | doi = 10.1080/07315724.2000.10718943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains roughly the same amount of umami as broths.

There are some distinctions among stocks from different countries. In ''[[dashi]]'', L-glutamate comes from sea ''[[kombu]]'' (''Laminaria japonica'') and inosinate from dried bonito flakes (''[[katsuobushi]]'') or dried sardines (''[[niboshi]]'').

==Taste receptors==
Most [[taste bud]]s on the tongue and other regions of the mouth can detect umami taste, irrespective of their location. The [[tongue map]] in which different tastes are distributed in different regions of the tongue is a common misconception. [[Biochemical]] studies have identified the [[taste receptor]]s responsible for the sense of umami as modified forms of [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 4|mGluR4]], [[Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1|mGluR1]] and [[Taste receptor|taste receptor type 1 (T1R1 + T1R3)]], all of which have been found in all regions of the tongue bearing taste buds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chaudhari N, Landin AM, Roper SD | title = A metabotropic glutamate receptor variant functions as a taste receptor | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 3 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–9 | date = February 2000 | pmid = 10649565 | doi = 10.1038/72053 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nelson G, Chandrashekar J, Hoon MA, Feng L, Zhao G, Ryba NJ, Zuker CS | title = An amino-acid taste receptor | journal = Nature | volume = 416 | issue = 6877 | pages = 199–202 | date = March 2002 | pmid = 11894099 | doi = 10.1038/nature726 | bibcode = 2002Natur.416..199N }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = San Gabriel A, Uneyama H, Yoshie S, Torii K | title = Cloning and characterization of a novel mGluR1 variant from vallate papillae that functions as a receptor for L-glutamate stimuli | journal = Chemical Senses | volume = 30 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl | pages = i25-6 | date = January 2005 | pmid = 15738140 | doi = 10.1093/chemse/bjh095 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 review corroborated the acceptance of these receptors, stating, "Recent molecular biological studies have now identified strong candidates for umami receptors, including the heterodimer T1R1/T1R3, and truncated type 1 and 4 metabotropic glutamate receptors missing most of the N-terminal extracellular domain (taste-mGluR4 and truncated-mGluR1) and brain-mGluR4."&lt;ref name="Symposium"/&gt;

Receptors mGluR1 and mGluR4 are specific to glutamate whereas T1R1 + T1R3 are responsible for the synergism already described by Akira Kuninaka in 1957. However, the specific role of each type of receptor in taste bud cells remains unclear. They are [[G protein-coupled receptors]] (GPCRs) with similar signaling molecules that include [[G protein]]s beta-gamma, [[PLCB2]] and [[Inositol triphosphate|PI3]]-mediated release of [[calcium]] (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) from intracellular stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kinnamon SC | title = Taste receptor signalling - from tongues to lungs | journal = Acta Physiologica | volume = 204 | issue = 2 | pages = 158–68 | date = February 2012 | pmid = 21481196 | pmc = 3704337 | doi = 10.1111/j.1748-1716.2011.02308.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Calcium activates the selective cation channel transient receptor potential melastatin 5 ([[TRPM5]]) that leads to membrane [[depolarization]] and the consequent release of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[secretion]] of [[neurotransmitter]]s including [[serotonin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pérez CA, Huang L, Rong M, Kozak JA, Preuss AK, Zhang H, Max M, Margolskee RF | title = A transient receptor potential channel expressed in taste receptor cells | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 1169–76 | date = November 2002 | pmid = 12368808 | doi = 10.1038/nn952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Y, Hoon MA, Chandrashekar J, Mueller KL, Cook B, Wu D, Zuker CS, Ryba NJ | title = Coding of sweet, bitter, and umami tastes: different receptor cells sharing similar signaling pathways | journal = Cell | volume = 112 | issue = 3 | pages = 293–301 | date = February 2003 | pmid = 12581520 | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(03)00071-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dando R, Roper SD | title = Cell-to-cell communication in intact taste buds through ATP signalling from pannexin 1 gap junction hemichannels | journal = The Journal of Physiology | volume = 587 | issue = Pt 24 | pages = 5899–906 | date = December 2009 | pmid = 19884319 | pmc = 2808547 | doi = 10.1113/jphysiol.2009.180083 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Roper SD | title = Signal transduction and information processing in mammalian taste buds | journal = Pflügers Archiv | volume = 454 | issue = 5 | pages = 759–76 | date = August 2007 | pmid = 17468883 | pmc = 3723147 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-007-0247-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cells responding to umami taste stimuli do not possess typical [[synapse]]s, but ATP conveys taste signals to gustatory nerves and in turn to the [[brain]] that interprets and identifies the taste quality via the [[gut-brain axis]].&lt;ref name=torii/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clapp TR, Yang R, Stoick CL, Kinnamon SC, Kinnamon JC | title = Morphologic characterization of rat taste receptor cells that express components of the phospholipase C signaling pathway | journal = The Journal of Comparative Neurology | volume = 468 | issue = 3 | pages = 311–21 | date = January 2004 | pmid = 14681927 | doi = 10.1002/cne.10963 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwatsuki K, Ichikawa R, Hiasa M, Moriyama Y, Torii K, Uneyama H | title = Identification of the vesicular nucleotide transporter (VNUT) in taste cells | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 388 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–5 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19619506 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbrc.2009.07.069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5774">'''Vladimir Slepian''', a.k.a. '''Eric Pid''' ({{lang-ru|Владимир Слепян / Эрик Пид}}; 1930 – 7 July 1998) is a [[France|French]] artist and writer of [[Russia]]n-[[Jew]]ish origin.

==Biography==
Son of a repressed and executed Soviet functionary, Vladimir Slepian was born in [[Prague]] and resided in [[Leningrad]] before moving to [[Moscow]]. He began his university studies in mathematics, continuing as a student of fine art. In 1956 Slepian moved to Moscow. He attended the Picasso exhibition at the [[Pushkin Museum]] and presented his paintings to [[David Burliuk]], who was then staying at [[Hotel Moskva (Moscow)|Hotel Moskva]]. Burliuk inspired Slepian to look towards the way [[Jackson Pollock]] deposited paint on canvas with broad, lunging, spontaneous gestures. Slepian’s style evolved towards [[happening]] and [[performance art]]. He devoted several years to [[action painting]]. On one occasion, Slepian conducted a séance of simultaneous painting in collaboration with [[Yuri Zlotnikov]]. They suspended a bedsheet in the middle of a room and each of them painted one side of it whilst following the actions of his partner on the other side through the translucent fabric. Slepian created abstract paintings using a gas torch and paint dispensed out of a pump. He is said to have worked on a canvas a few kilometers long, by pouring paint on it from a truck. Slepian also made a pilgrimage to [[Nazım Hikmet]], who assured him and his friends that modern art will prevail over political oppression. In 1957 Paris' Right Bank Galerie Daniel Cordier mounted an anonymous exhibition of paintings by Vladimir Slepian, smuggled out of Moscow by its owner.

Vladimir Slepian emigrated to [[France]] in 1958, by way of [[Poland]]. In 1960 he conducted a performance of “transfinite painting” ("трансфинитная живопись") in Paris. Slepian sprinted along a roll of paper a hundred meters long, depositing paint in a manner that recalled calligraphy. Slepian competed with [[Georges Mathieu]], by creating a picture in ninety seconds. He is said to have turned a road into an action painting by throwing paint onto it whilst riding a motorcycle. In 1963, Slepian gave up painting, resolving to concentrate on writing. He founded a successful translation bureau, explaining his ambition as using his intelligence to put others to work for his benefit, whilst enjoying idleness. His business operated successfully until its manager quit in a protest against Slepian’s despotism.

In his only published French text, a short story ''Fils de chien'', Vladimir Slepian writes of a man who decides to become a dog. He transforms himself one limb and one organ at a time, mapping the effects of the canine body across a human form in a kind of diagramming. Since dogs are quadrupeds, he ties shoes to his hands and feet. When his paws prevent him from lacing the fourth shoe, he uses his mouth, which becomes a dog's snout. This metamorphosis almost succeeds, until the hero comes to the dog’s tail, for which he can find no analogue among human limbs. For him to involve his sexual organ in this transmogrification would tear him away from the society that he has begun to flee. Who would he be, if his identity could not be inferred from his anatomy? The story ends with a descent into childhood memories of the protagonist's mother. It appeared in n° 7 of the ''[[Revue Minuit]]'' alongside texts by [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Robert Pinget]], and [[Alain Robbe-Grillet]]. It served as inspiration for discussion by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''.

Several years later, Vladimir Slepian renamed himself Eric Pid. He explained his new French name as an anagram of the blind king Oedipus, alluding to blindness at the etymological origins of his Russian family name. In his later years, Slepian succeeded at having his dramatic text staged as an interpolation in ''[[A quand Agamemnon ?]]'', an adaptation of [[Aeschylus]]’ ''[[Agamemnon]]'' by Philippe Brunet and Demodocos, a band of young artists specialized in classical theatre, performed in French, Latin and/or ancient Greek. He went around Paris, distributing framed photographs of this performance for wall display at restaurants. On 7 July 1998, Slepian collapsed on a sidewalk at [[Saint-Germain des Prés]]. The cause of his death is variously reported as [[hunger]] and a [[Myocardial infarction|cardiac crisis]]. He was buried as an [[indigent]], at the state’s expense.

Vladimir Slepian’s life served as inspiration for Viktor Atemian, the protagonist of 2007 feature film ''L’Homme qui marche'' by [[Aurélia Georges]].
