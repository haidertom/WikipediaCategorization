      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Anthropology of food''' is a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]] that connects an [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] and historical perspective with contemporary social issues in food production and consumption systems. 

Although early anthropological accounts often dealt with cooking and eating as part of ritual or daily life, food was rarely regarded as the central point of academic focus. This changed in the later half of the 20th century, when foundational work by [[Mary Douglas]], [[Marvin Harris]], [[Arjun Appadurai]], [[Jack Goody]], and [[Sidney Mintz]] cemented the study of food as a key insight into modern social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Handbook of Food and Anthropology|last=Klein and Watson|first=|publisher=]Bloomsbury Academic|year=2016|isbn=9780857855947|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mintz is known as the "Father of food anthropology"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/us/sidney-mintz-father-of-food-anthropology-dies-at-93.html|title=Sidney Mintz, Father of Food Anthropology, dies at 93|last=Roberts|first=Sam|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his work ''Sweetness and Power (1985),''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History|last=Mintz|first=Sidney|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=0140092331|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which linked British demand for sugar with the creation of empire and exploitative industrial labor conditions. 

Research has traced the material and symbolic importance of food, as well as how they intersect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Oxford Handbook of Food History|last=Pilcher|first=Jeremy|publisher=|year=2012|isbn=9780199729937|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Examples of ongoing themes are food as a form of differentiation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|publisher=Routledge|year=1984|isbn=0-674-21277-0|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, commensality, and food's role in industrialization and globalizing labor and commodity chains.  

Several related and interdisciplinary academic programs exist in the US and UK&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.food-culture.org/food-studies-programs/|title=Food Studies Programs|last=|first=|date=|website=food-culture.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (listed under [[Food studies]] institutions).

Such initiatives are often temporary, informal and citizen-led as well as taking place in unused, if not abandoned, urban spaces&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tonkiss|first=Fran|date=2013|title=Austerity urbanism and the makeshift city.|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13604813.2013.795332|journal=City|volume=17|pages=312-324|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Definitions ==
Austerity urbanism can be described in several ways and gathers different components. The following lines present the main definitions and interpretations of the concept.

First, austerity urbanism is based upon two main notions : [[austerity]] and [[urbanism]].

Generally speaking, austerity is ''“a situation in which people’s living standards are reduced because of economic difficulties”'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/austerity|title="Austerity" definition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.'' Austerity is also described as ''“a condition of enforced or extreme economy”'' &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;''.'' Here, austerity refers to the reduction of investment, as well as expenditure in general, by the state due to an economy in jeopardy. 

Recent episodes of austerity are often linked with [[neoliberalism]], which is the latest form of [[capitalism]]. Its main idea is to restrict the power of public institutions as well as government spending and to give precedence to the [[market economy]], in order to increase the role of the [[private sector]] in the society as well as maintain [[Public sector|public sectors]] in good financial health. Given that the private sector is in charge in the neoliberal system, public expenditures are less likely to occur. This is what leading to austerity in bad economic times&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Davies|first=Jonathan|last2=Blanco|first2=Ismael|date=2017|title=Austerity urbanism : Patterns of neo-liberalisation and resistance in six cities of Spain and the UK.|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0308518X17701729|journal=Environment and Planning A|volume=49|pages=1517-1536|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Second, austerity urbanism is a type of urbanism that shows the repercussions of austerity. The critical situation of the economy has a significant effect on the development of cities. Investors, due to economic crisis and lack of attractive investment options, reduce the amount of money they invest in cities, leaving neighborhoods or entire cities worse off. In other words, an episode of austerity may leave municipalities with no alternative about the lack of investment of private actors, and create difficulties to manage the development of their cities. Moreover, the possibility for actors from the private sector to withdraw at any moment puts municipalities in a position where they may not have the means to manage their urban development themselves&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

Finally, austerity urbanism happens when the private sector reduces its investment. Due to the lack of funds of the municipalities, neighborhoods are at risk of not receiving proper investment. At that point, individuals or local associations may take control and launch their own urban initiatives in places neglected by municipalities. This process often leads to attracting, once again, the private sector after those places have been reshaped for temporary use by the local community. In the meantime, the actions of local communities work as transitional uses before future developments&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

== Origins ==
To understand the emergence of austerity urbanism, it is necessary to explore first the notion of austerity and its impacts throughout history as austerity urbanism appears later as a consequence of such a context.

The notion of austerity is not new in the history of humankind, but as an explicit concept, it did not start to be until the beginning of the 20th century. The economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] was amongst the first ones to use it. In the wake of [[World War I]], he made known his disagreement on the [[Treaty of Versailles]], opining that it was not a good idea to impose an economy of austerity on Germany. He argued that it would also weaken other countries in Europe. The risk was also that the impoverishment of Germany could raise fierce opposition to the treaty in Germany and maybe even a revolution. At that time, Keynes supported a more interventionist economic policy and was therefore against a deliberate austerity build up&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dostaler|first=Gilles|date=2007|title=Les fondements philosophiques de l'oeuvre de Keynes.|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/DOSLFP|journal=The Proceedings of the Twenty-First World Congress of Philosophy : Logic and Philosophy of the Sciences|volume=5|pages=155-160|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the 1930s, the notion of austerity reappeared with the [[Great Depression]] and its consequences, Europe as a whole being in a situation of austerity. This crisis framework appeared again after the [[World War II|Second World War]], plunging several European countries into a state of misery, which can be qualified as austerity. At this moment, it was clear that the continent needed to rebuild its devastated lands and cities.

This state of austerity gradually faded away during "[[Trente Glorieuses|The Glorious Thirty]]" but resurfaced quickly in the 1980s with the general awareness of ecological limits and key resource depletion which suggested the rethinking of the socio-economic system. Then, with the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|subprime crisis]] in 2007-2008, the notion of austerity came back strongly and explicitly especially in the economic and urban realm. Indeed, the changing economic conditions led to the emergence of the concept of austerity urbanism. In austerity urbanism, cities have to take care of themselves since ''“municipal governments act as cost-saving business actors that envisage running cities like corporations”'' &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peck|first=Jamie|date=2015|title=Austerity urbanism : The neoliberal crisis of American cities|url=http://www.rosalux-nyc.org/wp-content/files_mf/peck_austerity_urbanism_eng.pdf|journal=Rosa Luxemburg Stiftung : New York|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Even if the situation is not uniform across cities, nor completely comparable, the manifestation of austerity became ''“evident at the urban scale”''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

Nowadays, there are several ideological undercurrents involved in the austerity narrative. On the one hand, the “economy of means” current suggests that one must stop living beyond one's means. In order to reduce the negative consequences of austerity urbanism, such as the rise of youth unemployment as well as poverty, social exclusion and the increasing debt prevailing in most Western economies for example&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anyadike-Danes|first=Michael|last2=Fitoussi|first2=Jean-Paul|last3=Le Cacheux|first3=Jacques|date=1983|title=De l'austérité budgétaire en période de récession.|url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/ofce_0751-6614_1983_num_5_1_958|journal=Observations et diagnostics économiques : revue de l'OFCE|volume=5|pages=121-148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it is considered necessary to be cautious regarding public expenses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sen|first=Amartya|date=2015|title=Les conséquences économiques de l’austérité.|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-l-economie-politique-2015-3-p-102.htm|journal=L'Économie politique|volume=|pages=102-112|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this can result in the mistrust in the institutions and this increasing dissatisfaction leads to the weakening of the aforesaid institutions. On the other hand, when austerity reaches its limits, it can also open up new opportunities and therefore generate great possibilities in the urbanistic field, such as citizen-led initiatives taking place in unusual spaces or forms, in an attempt from the population to counteract the crisis situation and austerity measures&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

To sum up, there is therefore a crisis-linked austerity situation in opposition to an ideological vision of prudence, which tend to maintain a pressure for unnecessary cost-avoidance. Between these two perspectives, it may be quite difficult to carry out urban planning assignments, as it necessarily implies investments at a time when funds are seemingly lacking. This is the global context in which the notion of austerity urbanism emerged, whose definition was proposed in 2012 by various authors, including Fran Tonkiss and Jamie Peck. The notion of austerity in urban planning is evolving, not being always a negative assertion, but also valuing the opportunities and innovative solutions that are created within the practice of urban planning. The notion of austerity urbanism is in fact more and more linked to that of [[tactical urbanism]] and improvisational urbanism, emphasizing in particular the growing importance of citizen solidarity. These connotations complement what has to be considered, altogether, as a progressive vision of urbanism where the game is to take advantage of a crisis to allow for new collective achievements to emerge.

== Practical interventions under conditions of austerity ==
Planning under austerity can lead to alternative and critical spatial practices, that are described by [[Kevin A. Lynch|Kevin Lynch]] as a strategy for ''“dealing with the existing city [in] the search for underused space and time, and its readaptation for a desired activity. We can explore the use of streets as play areas, or the possibilities for using roof tops, empty stores, abandoned buildings, waste lots, odd bits of land, or the large areas presently sterilized by such mono-cultures as parking lots, expressways, railroad yards, and airports”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=City Sense and City Design: Writings and Projects of Kevin Lynch|last=Lynch|first=Kevin|publisher=MIT Press.|year=1995|isbn=|editor-last=Banerjee|editor-first=T.|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=771-788|chapter=The Possible City (1968)|editor-last2=Southworth|editor-first2=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

These makeshift, informal and often temporary urban interventions were categorized by Fran Tonkiss in four protocols for planning under austerity, depending on the degree of facilitation by existing policies&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;:

# The ''“Positive model”'' provides the best conditions for the development of such self-organized interventions as it integrates their informal nature into formal processes, by offering building permits for instance.
# The ''“Permissive model”'' neither facilitates, nor excludes unconventional planning strategies, being based on a tolerant approach regarding them.
# The “''Proscription model''” on the other hand leaves almost no space for negotiation and improvisation initiatives by criminalizing or implementing punitive measures against them.
# The ''“Abandonment model”'' positions these interventions as an urbanism of last resort, in response to the complete roll back of the state in terms of territorial governance.

[[File:Berlin-Kreuzberg Prinzessinnengärten 1.jpg|thumb|Prinzessinnengärten, Berlin Kreuzberg]]
In reality, these four approaches are often combined, as the case of [[Squatting in England and Wales|squatting]] in some British cities that is a mix of the third and the fourth model. Indeed, in 2012, residential squatting was criminalized in England, and at the same time, budget cutback made it difficult to positively promote alternative practices, despite the ambitions of the [[Big Society]] political ideology. This situation was paradoxical considering that at that time the number of empty houses in the country well exceeded the number of squatters in the UK&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

On a more micro-scale level, interstitial urbanism such as [[community gardening]] is another form of alternative urban interventions, open to improvisation and adaptation. Such initiatives can take place on brownfields, waste ground like the [[:de:Prinzessinnengärten|Prinzessinnengärten]] in Berlin or even in-between two buildings, as it is the case with the self-managed space on the rue [http://www.urbantactics.org/projets/passage56/ Saint-Blaise 56] in Paris&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petcou|first=Constantin|last2=Petrescu|first2=Doina|date=2007|title=Agir l’espace : notes transversales, observations de terrain et questions concrètes pour chacun de nous|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-multitudes-2007-4-page-101.htm|journal=Multitudes|volume=31|pages=101-114|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In a context of austerity, these sites represent an important testing ground for urban experimentation as well as providing local services and spaces to counteract the lack of public policy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

=== The case of Todmorden, England ===
[[File:Todmorden.jpg|thumb|Urban vegetable gardens along the Rochdale canal, Todmorden]]
[[Todmorden]] is a northern English town that engaged in austerity urbanism following the [[deindustrialization]]. Between the 1970s and 2010, the city lost about half of its population, mostly being workers that became unemployed. In response to the crisis, citizens had the idea of producing food in public spaces, cultivating vegetables in [[Urban horticulture|urban gardens]] located in every unused space around the city like next to the train station, the main road or even the police station&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pages.rts.ch/emissions/abe/5974537-sous-les-paves-des-legumes.html#5974539|title=RTS documentary about the Incredible Edible project|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Todmorden is in fact the first city in the world to have launched, in 2008, a food [[self-sufficiency]] initiative, called the [[Incredible Edible]]. Nowadays, the project is still successfully going and contributes to strengthening social bonds and solidarity among the population&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://orgprints.org/24956/28/24956.pdf|title=Diversifying Foods and Diets: Using Agricultural Biodiversity to Improve Nutrition and Health.|last=Paull|first=John|publisher=Earthscan, Routledge|year=2013|isbn=|editor-last=Franzo|editor-first=J.|location=Oxford|pages=336-345|chapter="Please Pick Me" – How Incredible Edible Todmorden is repurposing the commons for open source food and agricultural biodiversity|editor-last2=Hunter|editor-first2=D.|editor-last3=Borelli|editor-first3=T.|editor-last4=Mattei|editor-first4=F.}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Criticism ==
Temporary urbanism can involve risks. Indeed, temporary and self-organized projects could also be used to keep unused lands attractive while the economy is in crisis&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and therefore facilitating the state withdrawal from its responsibilities. As Margit Mayer pointed out, ''“principles such as self-management, self-realization and all kinds of unconventional or insurgent creativity (…) have lost the radical edge they used to entail in the context of the overbearing Keynesian welfare state - in today’s neoliberal urbanism they have been usurped as essential ingredients of sub-local regeneration programs”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mayer|first=Margit|date=2013|title=First World Urban Activism: Beyond Austerity Urbanism and Creative City Politics.|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13604813.2013.757417|journal=City|volume=17|pages=5-19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The concept itself of austerity urbanism is the subject of different critical points of views. From a [[Free market|free-market]] perspective, austerity is a necessary, if temporary, measure to assure the financial health of the public sector where it has been spending too much and faces a large amount of debt and deficit. This perspective relates to the orthodox neoclassical economic theory which argues, against a Keynesian ideology, that public investments are bad for the economy in a long term. For the free-market advocates, austerity is a way to purge non-efficient institutions and enterprises and let new technologies and strategies emerge in a [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeterian]] creative destruction perspective. Translated to urban planning theories, austerity means that it is beneficial for the economy to cut public investments in urban development and let private initiatives and the private sector run cities. Entrepreneurial urbanism argues that the public sector should function more like the private sector and seek to make returns on investment on public spending and be competitive to decrease the distortions of public intervention in the market&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

On the other hand, heterodox economy, radical geography, other fields of research, and left wing or Marxists political parties see austerity as a punitive and non-justified policy related to a pejorative perception of neoliberalism. Increasing inequalities, gaps in the rights to the city, and social injustice, austerity urbanism leads to what [[David Harvey]] describes as ''“accumulation by dispossession''”&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. In this point of view, austerity should be stopped and new social strategies of urban development should be organized to fight the commodification and financialisation of cities&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;.

The '''Bio21 Institute of Molecular Science and Biotechnology''', abbreviated as the '''Bio21 Institute''', is an Australian scientific research [[research institute|institute]] focuses on the study of basic science and applied biotechnology. The Bio21 Institute is based at the [[University of Melbourne]] on [[Flemington Road, Melbourne|Flemington Road]] in {{VICcity|Parkville}}, [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

The Institute is managed by the University of Melbourne and is supported by funding from the Victorian Government.

==History==
Established in 2002 and officially opened in 2005, the research centre conducts interdisciplinary learning and houses research groups specializing in biochemistry, cell biology, chemistry, and other life sciences. Bio21 accommodates over 500 research scientists, students and industry participants, making it one of the largest biotechnology research centres in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/about-bio21 |title=About Bio21 |date=2015 |accessdate=13 September 2016 |website=www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au |publisher= |last= |first= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502095837/http://www.bio21.unimelb.edu.au/about-bio21 |archivedate=2 May 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{self-published inline|date=September 2016}}

In September 2006, Bio21 formed a partnership with Australian-based global bio-pharmaceutical company [[CSL Limited]]. 50 scientists from CSL were relocated to participate in activities at the Bio21. The goal of the partnership was for Bio21 to gain the expertise of industry professionals and for CSL to gain access to state-of-the-art equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CSL scientists move to Melbourne Uni |work=NineMSN |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |date=2006 |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=65820 |accessdate=1 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920095034/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=65820 |archivedate=20 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Rebecca |title=Bio21 Inst to host CSL scientists |journal=UniNews |volume=15 |number=17 |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |date=2006 |url=http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/news/3671/ |accessdate=1 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912023818/http://uninews.unimelb.edu.au/news/3671/ |archivedate=12 September 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CS50 lectures are recorded and uploaded to several services including [[iTunes U]], edX (where it is known as CS50x), and YouTube. Additional video "walkthroughs" are recorded with professors and volunteer students. Course questions, called problem sets, or "psets" for short, are available in both PDF and HTML format. Students can upload problem set answers, and some questions are graded by automation. Students can also use special software to check their code in the [[Cloud computing|cloud]]. In 2016, CS50 became the first university course to offer students the possibility to watch all lectures entirely in [[virtual reality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CS50 Moves Away from Traditional Lectures, Toward Virtual Reality|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/8/31/CS50-moves-from-lectures/|website=The Crimson|date=2016-08-31|author=Fahs, C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3308">'''Censorship of student media''' pertains to the suppression of free speech by school administrative bodies of student-run news operations. Typically this involves interfering with the operation and final publishing authority of a [[school newspaper]], radio, television or other electronic online content generated by students. 

While this has typically consisted of schools enforcing their authority to control the funding and distribution of publications, sometimes forms of censorship extend to expression not funded by or under the official auspices of the school system or college (for example, confiscating independently produced "underground" publications or imposing discipline for material posted on off-campus websites).

==United States==
The states of Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts and Oregon have all passed legislation fortifying student journalists' right to free expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Student Press Law Center |url=http://www.splc.org/knowyourrights/law_library.asp |title=Student Press Law center - Law Library |publisher=SPLC |date= |accessdate=2013-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The nonprofit [[Student Press Law Center]] tracks and provides pro-bono legal aid to student-run media organizations in the U.S.

Some notable cases in the [[United States]] include:
* [[Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier]],1988- A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision that held that public school curricular student newspapers that have not been established as forums for student expression are subject to a lower level of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protection than independent student expression or newspapers established (by policy or practice) as forums for student expression. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1987/86-836&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]], 1969&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1968/21&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rosenberger v. University of Virginia]], 1995&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/1994/94-329&lt;/ref&gt;
* Papish v. Board of Curators of University of Missouri - A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling that the University of Missouri could not discipline a college student for profanity and "indecent" sexual references in an "underground" publication that she funded and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;"Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri, 410 U.S. 667 (1973)." [http://media.okstate.edu/faculty/jsenat/jb3163/papish.html Papish v. Board of Curators of the University of Missouri], 410 U.S. 667 (1973). Accessed October 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Morse v. Frederick]], 2007- A [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision in the case of 18-year-old Joseph Frederick, punished for displaying a banner reading "BONG HiTS 4 JESUS" across the street from a school during the 2002 Olympic Torch Relay, concluding that speech promoting illegal drug use during school-sanctioned events is unprotected. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/06-278&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Centre for History and Philosophy of Science''' is a research institution devoted to the historical and philosophical study of science and technology, based in the Department of [[Philosophy]], at the [[University of Leeds]] in [[West Yorkshire]], England. The Centre – previously known as the Division of History and Philosophy of Science, which was founded in 1956 – is one of the oldest institutions of its kind in the world. Throughout its history, the Centre has been home to many of the leading historians and philosophers of science who have shaped our understanding of scientific activity and how it shapes and is shaped by wider society.

==Early history and expansion==
The key figure in establishing history and philosophy of science (HPS) as a discipline at Leeds was the philosopher of science [[Stephen Toulmin]], who was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Leeds in 1954 and head of department in 1956. Whilst [[Thomas Kuhn]] is often seen as the founder of the modern field of history and philosophy of science, Toulmin had argued for an integration of philosophy of science and history of science some nine years before Kuhn published his famous work, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions''.&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, ''Philosophy of Science: An Introduction'' (1953)&lt;/ref&gt;
After becoming head of the department of philosophy, Toulmin hired two young scholars who would subsequently become amongst the most important thinkers in history and philosophy of science: Jerry Ravetz&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jerryravetz.co.uk/ Jerry Ravetz], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and June Goodfield. Furthermore, physicist-turned-historian Donald Cardwell become a research fellow in HPS and then a lecturer. However, Cardwell left Leeds in 1963 to start a similar department at UMIST. When Toulmin, followed by Goodfield, left Leeds for the USA in 1959, Ravetz led the Leeds HPS group into a period of expansion during the 1960s, which is described by many as a ‘golden age’ of HPS at Leeds. A number of scholars were hired, including Piyo Rattansi, Charles Webster, Ted McGuire, Maurice Crosland, and Charles Schmitt, and a number of postgraduate students who would go to become leading HPS thinkers, such as Margaret Jacob&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/jacob/ Margaret Jacob] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207224607/http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/history/jacob/ |date=December 7, 2008 }}, [[UCLA]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Fox,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ox.ac.uk/staff/faculty/fox_r.htm Robert Fox], [[University of Oxford]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; studied at Leeds with them.   

In the 1970s, after the departures of – amongst others – Webster and Crosland, historian of genetics Robert Olby became a leading figure in the Division through his book ''Path to the Double Helix'',&lt;ref&gt;Robert Olby, ''Path to the Double Helix'' (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; which showed how the 1953 discoveries of [[Francis Crick|Crick]] and [[James D. Watson|Watson]] were rooted in the work of two University of Leeds scientists: the creator of molecular biology, [[William Astbury]], and the Nobel prizewinning inventor of [[X-ray crystallography]], [[William Henry Bragg]]. During this period, a number of scholars who would shape HPS at Leeds during the 1980s and 1990s were appointed. These scholars included John Christie&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/Jrrc/Index.htm John Christie] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807234936/http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/Jrrc/Index.htm |date=August 7, 2009 }}, University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Hodge&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/JH/Index.htm Jonathan Hodge] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614083917/http://www.philosophy.leeds.ac.uk/Staff/JH/Index.htm |date=June 14, 2009 }}, University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Geoffrey Cantor]], whose groundbreaking research on the history of physics – in particular [[Isaac Newton]] and [[Michael Faraday]] – would earn him the first professorship in the HPS division at Leeds.&lt;ref&gt;''Michael Faraday: Sandemanian and Scientist : a Study of Science and Religion in the Nineteenth Century'' (1991), ''Optics After Newton: Theories of Light in Britain and Ireland, 1704–1840'' (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Hodge collaborated with Geoffrey Cantor on the classic co-edited study ''Conceptions of Ether: Studies in the History of Ether Theories, 1740–1900'' (1981). However, Dr Hodge’s main research interest lies in the history of theories of creation and, in this context, he has written historical articles on the theories of [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] and [[Ronald Fisher]], as well as philosophical pieces on evolutionary biology. In chronological terms, Hodge’s historical focus has been on the period 1770–1850, especially in France and Britain, working on [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and [[Charles Darwin]]. Monographs are under preparation{{when|date=January 2011}} on the last two, following on from the ''Cambridge Companion to Darwin'' (2003), which was co-edited with recently arrived colleague Gregory Radick, and recently issued in a second edition to celebrate the 150th anniversary of the publication of ''On the Origin of Species''.

John Christie has a broad range of expertise in enlightenment science, especially th history of chemistry. A significant proportion of his articles focus on the characters of [[William Cullen]] and [[Joseph Black]] in [[Edinburgh]] and on [[Joseph Priestley]] in Leeds. Christie, too, has collaborated with Geoffrey Cantor, their shared interests in linguistic aspects of science leading to the co-edited volume ''The Figural and the Literal: Problems of Language in the History of Science and Philosophy, 1630–1800'' (1987).

Notable research students supervised by Cantor, Hodge, and Christie include:

* Chris Kenny&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/842/chris_kenny Chris Kenny], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; – supervised by Cantor and now a teaching fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Leeds. 
* Sam Alberti – co-supervised by Hodge, Graeme Gooday (Leeds), and Sally Shuttleworth (Sheffield), and now Keeper of Science and Technology at National Museums Scotland.
* Jan Golinski&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unh.edu/history/golinski/index.html Jan Golinski] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417055157/http://www.unh.edu/history/golinski/index.html |date=April 17, 2009 }}, [[University of New Hampshire]], USA.&lt;/ref&gt; – supervised by Christie and now Professor of History and Humanities at the [[University of New Hampshire]].
* Mark Jackson&lt;ref&gt;[http://huss.exeter.ac.uk/history/staff/jackson/ Mark Jackson], [[University of Exeter]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; – supervised by Christie and now Professor of the History of Medicine and Director of the Centre for Medical History at the [[University of Exeter]].

Furthermore, the collective endeavours of life in the Division of HPS at Leeds were epitomized in the much-cited multi-authored ''Companion to the History of Modern Science'' (1990), co-edited by Olby, Cantor, Christie and Hodge. Although there are now competitor volumes, articles from the Leeds Companion still reside on many a reading list for history of science courses throughout the world.

==Diversification and expansion in the 1990s==
From 1993 onwards, Leeds HPS took a new direction as several new specialist appointments were made in the philosophy of science, the history of medicine and the history of technology. Professor Steven French&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/902/steven_french Steven French], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; came to Leeds in 1993, having previously worked in Brazil and the USA. He teaches the philosophy of science, especially the philosophy of physics, and he has supervised numerous PhD students in both areas. His research covers several areas in the history and philosophy of physics. Primarily, Professor French is known for a structuralist approach to models and theories, which can be extended to cover issues of explanation and representation in science and also provides the formal basis for a form of structural realism. 

In the same year that Steven French was appointed, Adrian Wilson,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/822/adrian_wilson Adrian Wilson], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Lecturer in History of Medicine, came to the Division under a Wellcome University Award. Dr Wilson’s main research focus is seventeenth- and eighteenth-century midwifery/childbirth, particularly with reference to male and female roles in delivery – a subject he explored in his book ''The Making of Man-Midwifery'' (1995). However, Dr. Wilson also studies English provincial voluntary hospitals in the eighteenth century and the history of pathology.   With help from colleagues, Dr. Wilson built up History of Medicine teaching both as part of the HPS degree programmes (BA and MA) and within the medical curriculum; and Leeds now offers an Intercalated Degree in History of Medicine (only the fourth such degree in Britain). 

In 1994, Graeme Gooday&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/860/graeme_gooday Graeme Gooday], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed to teach courses on the history and philosophy (especially the ethics) of technology. Gooday’s main research interests are in the history of late nineteenth-century physics, technology, instrumentation, and gender. In particular, as demonstrated by his first book, ''The Morals of Measurement: Accuracy, Irony and Trust in Late Victorian Electrical Practice'' (2004), Gooday focuses on the history of laboratories, the multifaceted roles of measurement and on the spatial issues of scientific practice.

Jonathan Topham&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/872/jon_topham Jonathan Topham], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;arrived in Leeds in 1999 as an AHRB Institutional Fellow for the Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciper.leeds.ac.uk/ Science in the Nineteenth-Century Periodical (SciPer) Project], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; having previously worked on the Darwin Correspondence Project and at the [[University of Cambridge]]. The work of the SciPer Project reflects Dr Topham’s wide interest in the production and reading of scientific publications in nineteenth-century Britain, a subject on which he has published a number of widely cited articles. Topham’s other main research focus is on science and religion, and he has published valuable articles on natural theology and theologies of nature in nineteenth-century Britain. As a lecturer in history and philosophy of science since January 2005, Topham has helped develop a new Masters programme in science communication in collaboration with the University of Leeds’s Institute of Communication Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/coursefinder/17024/MA_Science_Communication Communication Studies], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing his postgraduate studies at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], Dr Gregory Radick&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leeds.ac.uk/arts/people/20048/philosophy/person/861/gregory_radick Gregory Radick], University of Leeds, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; was appointed as lecturer in the HPS Division in 2000 during Professor Cantor’s sabbatical, becoming a permanent member of staff in 2003. His research and teaching specialties are in the history of the life sciences and the human sciences, with special emphasis on questions of Darwinism and genetics. He has published and contributed to two co-edited volumes, including, with colleague Jonathan Hodge, ''The Cambridge Companion to Darwin'' (2003), which was recently issued as a second edition. Radick’s research work has concentrated on three themes in particular: scientific studies of animal mind and animal language; the role of social context and historical contingency in the development of modern biology; and the new genetic technologies in historical and philosophical perspective, concentrating especially on patenting and genetic testing. An interest in the relations between changing technology and changing knowledge runs throughout his work and was demonstrated in his first book, ''The Simian Tongue: The Long Debate About Animal Language'' (2008).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2701">The '''Kabul - City Of Light Development''' is an urban reconstruction plan, first proposed  by urban planner and architect [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]] to revitalize the capital city of [[Afghanistan]].  The plan targets an area just south of the [[Kabul River]] for redevelopment.  This area, approximately 3.5km long and 1.75 km wide, still hosts residences, commercial and retail activity, despite the fact that it has been largely reduced to rubble after years of occupation and civil war, and many of the collapsed structures have become temporary shelters constructed of whatever is available, without [[building codes]] or standards.  The plan will revitalize [[Meywand Avenue]], one of the main avenues of commerce in the city and part of the historic [[Silk Route]], between the [[Shah Do Shamshera Mosque]] and the [[Id Gah Mosque]].  Retail, business, and residential areas are planned, alongside preserved and restored structures of historic value.  Also incorporated into this project is the new [[Afghan National Museum]].

==Design==
 
[[Image:KABULCITYMAP.jpg|thumb|350px|City Of Light Development]]

The design of the City Of Light is based on an "Arid Region Design Technique" that has proven itself over the past decades in cities such as [[Istanbul]], [[Baghdad]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Kabul]].  The project will rely on extensive use of concrete, in high-rise and national structures including all-exterior solar screen work. 

10% of the development's profit will be set aside for [[seed money]] to encourage refurbishment of nearby homes and businesses. 

The bases of the aesthetic designs to be used are rooted in the rich history of Afghan jewelry and rug designs. The buildings assembled in this project are most adaptable to various design themes, especially with the exterior glass skin being set within an outside screen of colored concrete in the shape of women's jewelry and rug patterns, extrapolated from culturally significant Afghan images.  Green space in the plan is also incorporated in the shape of Necklace Park, a greenway running through the development.

[[Image:Meywand1.jpg|thumb|350px|The proposed City Of Light Development]]

==Progress==
A [[Memorandum of Understanding]] has been signed with Afghan Ambassador to the United States [[Said Tayeb Jawad]] for greater development of this plan, and it was presented to President [[Hamid Karzai]] in May 2005.

The '''Clay Mathematics Institute''' ('''CMI''') is a private, [[non-profit]] [[foundation (nonprofit)|foundation]], based in [[Peterborough, New Hampshire]], United States. CMI's scientific activities are managed from the President's office in [[Oxford]], United Kingdom. The institute is "dedicated to increasing and disseminating [[mathematics|mathematical]] knowledge." It gives out various awards and sponsorships to promising mathematicians. The institute was founded in 1998 through the sponsorship of Boston businessman [[Landon T. Clay]]. [[Harvard University|Harvard]] mathematician [[Arthur Jaffe]] was the first president of CMI. 

While the institute is best known for its [[Millennium Prize Problems]], it carries out a wide range of activities, including a [[postdoctoral]] program (ten Clay Research Fellows are supported currently), conferences, workshops, and summer schools.

==Governance==
The institute is run according to a standard structure comprising a scientific advisory committee that decides on grant-awarding and research proposals, and a board of directors that oversees and approves the committee's decisions. {{As of|January 2015}}, the board is made up of members of the Clay family, whereas the advisory committee is composed of leading authorities in mathematics, namely [[Andrew Wiles|Sir Andrew Wiles]], [[Michael J. Hopkins|Michael Hopkins]], Carlos Kenig, [[Andrei Okounkov]], and [[Simon Donaldson]].  [[Nicholas Woodhouse]] is the current president of CMI.

==Millennium Prize Problems==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Convolution]] --&gt;
{{Main|Millennium Prize Problems}}
The institute is best known for establishing the Millennium Prize Problems on May 24, 2000. These seven problems are considered by CMI to be "important classic questions that have resisted solution over the years." For each problem, the first person to solve it will be awarded $1,000,000 by the CMI. In announcing the prize, CMI drew a parallel to [[Hilbert's problems]], which were proposed in 1900, and had a substantial impact on 20th century mathematics. Of the initial 23 Hilbert problems, most of which have been solved, only the [[Riemann hypothesis]] (formulated in 1859) is included in the seven Millennium Prize Problems.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jaffe's first-hand account of how this Millennium Prize came about can be read in [http://www.ams.org/notices/200606/fea-jaffe.pdf The Millennium Grand Challenge in Mathematics].&lt;/ref&gt;

For each problem, the Institute had a professional mathematician write up an official statement of the problem, which will be the main standard by which a given solution will be measured against. The seven problems are:

* [[P versus NP]]
* The [[Hodge conjecture]]
* The [[Poincaré conjecture]]—solved, by [[Grigori Perelman]]&lt;ref name="press-release-2010-03-18"&gt;{{cite press release|publisher=Clay Mathematics Institute| date=March 18, 2010 | format=PDF | title = Prize for Resolution of the Poincaré Conjecture Awarded to Dr. Grigoriy Perelman|url = http://www.claymath.org/poincare/millenniumPrizeFull.pdf | accessdate=March 18, 2010 | quote = The Clay Mathematics Institute (CMI) announces today that Dr. Grigoriy Perelman of [[St. Petersburg]], Russia, is the recipient of the Millennium Prize for resolution of the Poincaré conjecture.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Riemann hypothesis]]
* [[Yang–Mills existence and mass gap]]
* [[Navier–Stokes existence and smoothness]]
* The [[Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture]]

Some of the mathematicians who were involved in the selection and presentation of the seven problems were [[Michael Atiyah]], [[Enrico Bombieri]], [[Alain Connes]], [[Pierre Deligne]], [[Charles Fefferman]], [[John Milnor]], [[David Mumford]], [[Andrew Wiles]], and [[Edward Witten]].

==Other awards==
===The Clay Research Award===
{{main|Clay Research Award}}
In recognition of major breakthroughs in mathematical research, the institute has an annual prize — the Clay Research Award. Its recipients to date are [[Ian Agol]], [[Manindra Agrawal]], [[Yves Benoist]], [[Manjul Bhargava]], [[Danny Calegari]], [[Alain Connes]], [[Nils Dencker]], [[Alex Eskin]], [[David Gabai]], [[Ben J. Green|Ben Green]], [[Larry Guth]], [[Christopher Hacon]], [[Richard S. Hamilton]], [[Michael Harris (mathematician)|Michael Harris]], [[Jeremy Kahn]], [[Nets Katz]], [[Laurent Lafforgue]], [[Gérard Laumon]], [[Vladimir Markovic (mathematician)|Vladimir Markovic]], [[James McKernan]], [[Maryam Mirzakhani]], [[Ngô Bảo Châu]], [[Rahul Pandharipande]], [[Jonathan Pila]], [[Jean-François Quint]], [[Peter Scholze]], [[Oded Schramm]], [[Stanislav Smirnov]], [[Terence Tao]], [[Clifford Taubes]], [[Richard Taylor (mathematician)|Richard Taylor]], [[Claire Voisin]], [[Jean-Loup Waldspurger]], [[Andrew Wiles]], and [[Edward Witten]].

==Other activities==
Besides the Millennium Prize Problems, the Clay Mathematics Institute supports mathematics via the awarding of research fellowships (which range from two to five years, and are aimed at younger mathematicians), as well as shorter-term scholarships for programs, individual research, and book writing. The institute also has a yearly [[Clay Research Award]], recognizing major breakthroughs in mathematical research. Finally, the institute organizes a number of summer schools, conferences, workshops, public lectures, and outreach activities aimed primarily at junior mathematicians (from the high school to postdoctoral level). CMI publications are available in PDF form at most six months after they appear in print.

The episode of the television series ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' entitled "Solve for X" ([[List of Elementary episodes#Season 2 (2013–14)|Season 2, Episode 2]]) mentions the Clay Mathematics Institute in reference to their involvement in the [[P versus NP problem]].

'''Clinical professor''', also known as '''professor of practice''', is an [[Academic rank|academic appointment]] made to a member of a profession who is associated with a [[university]] and engages in practical instruction of [[professional student]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcg.edu/faculty/facman/fadpt/clinicaladjunct.html CLINICAL AND ADJUNCT FACULTY APPOINTMENT POLICY] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213071737/http://www.mcg.edu/faculty/facman/fadpt/clinicaladjunct.html |date=December 13, 2010 }}, [[Medical College of Georgia]] Faculty Manual. October 26, 2004.  &lt;/ref&gt; Titles in this category may include Clinical Instructor, Assistant Clinical Professor, Associate Clinical Professor, and Clinical Professor.&lt;ref name = "ucla" /&gt; Clinical professorship generally does not offer a "[[tenure track]]", but can be either full or part-time, and is typically noted for its emphasis on practical skills training as opposed to theoretical matters.

'''Cognitive sociology''' is a [[sociology|sociological]] sub-discipline devoted to the study of the "conditions under which meaning is constituted through processes of [[Reification (knowledge representation)|reification]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It does this by focusing on "the series of interpersonal processes that set up the conditions for phenomena to become “[[social objects]],” which subsequently shape thinking and thought."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raphael|first=Michael W.|year=2017|title=Cognitive Sociology|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/id/obo-9780199756384-0187|journal=Oxford Bibliographies Online in Sociology|volume=187|pages=|doi=10.1093/obo/9780199756384-0187|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, this research aims to sort out the social and cultural contingencies and consequences of human [[cognition]]. It has its roots in classical sociological theory, notably [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]] and [[Max Weber|Weber]], and from contemporary sociological theory, notably [[Erving Goffman|Goffman]] and [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Notable authors include but are not limited to, [[Eviatar Zerubavel]], [[Aaron Cicourel]], [[Barry Schwartz (psychologist)|Barry Schwartz]], [[Karen A.

The term 'cognitive sociology' was used already in 1974 by Cicourel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cicourel|first1=Aaron|title=Cognitive Sociology: Language and Meaning in Social Interaction|date=1974|publisher=Free Press|location=New Tork}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1997 DiMaggio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=DiMaggio|first1=Paul|title=Culture and Cognition|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|date=1997|volume=23|issue=1|pages=263–287|doi=10.1146/annurev.soc.23.1.263 }}&lt;/ref&gt; published what has been referred to as a now classic paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cerulo|first1=Karen|title=Mining the Intersection of Cognitive Sociology and Neuroscience|journal=Poetics|date=2010|volume=38|issue=2|pages=115–132|doi=10.1016/j.poetic.2009.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Cognitive Sociology in its current form.

The software was written by Professor [[Nigel Howard (professor)|Nigel Howard]] for General [[Rupert Smith]] in 1996.]]
'''Confrontation analysis''' (also known as '''dilemma analysis''') is an [[operational analysis]] technique used to structure, understand and think through multi-party interactions such as negotiations. It is the underpinning mathematical basis of [[drama theory]]. 

It is derived from [[game theory]] but considers that instead of resolving the game, the players often redefine the game when interacting. Emotions triggered from the potential interaction play a large part in this redefinition. So whereas game theory looks on an interaction as a single decision matrix and resolves that, confrontation analysis looks on the interaction as a sequence of linked interactions, where the decision matrix changes under the influence of precisely defined emotional ''dilemmas''.&lt;ref name="dilemm"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=17 definition of Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation and use==

Confrontation analysis was devised by Professor [[Nigel Howard (professor)|Nigel Howard]] in the early 1990s drawing from his work on game theory and [[metagame analysis]]. It has been turned to defence,&lt;ref name="dw1"&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-future-of-libya/4553627902 The future of Libya]&lt;/ref&gt; political, legal, financial&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;"role playing... can also be used by investors in the form of "confrontation analysis' such as that organised by former military analyst [[Michael Young (former military analyst)|Mike Young's]] [http://www.decisionworkshops.com Decision Workshops]" –  ''Greek Dungeons and German Dragons'', James Macintosh, ''[[Financial Times]]'', 9 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and commercial &lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/letting-agency/4550567082 Letting agency case study]&lt;/ref&gt; applications.

Much of the theoretical background to General [[Rupert Smith]]'s book ''[[The Utility of Force]]'' drew its inspiration from the theory of confrontation analysis.{{quotation|I am in debt to Professor Nigel Howard, whose explanation of Confrontation Analysis and Game Theory at a seminar in 1998 excited my interest. Our subsequent discussions helped me to order my thoughts and the lessons I had learned into a coherent structure with the result that, for the first time, I was able to understand my experiences within a theoretical model which allowed me to use them further|General Rupert Smith|[[The Utility of Force]] (p.xvi)}}

Confrontation analysis can also be used in a ''decision workshop'' as structure to support role-playing&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt; for training, analysis and decision rehearsal.

== Method ==
[[Image:BosniaConfrontation0.JPG|thumb|361px|left|An interaction as a sequence of confrontations where the ''card table''&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; changes as the parties struggle to eliminate their ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt;]]
Confrontation analysis looks on an interaction as a sequence of confrontations. During each confrontation the parties communicate until they have made their ''positions''&lt;ref name="posn"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=29 definition of Position]&lt;/ref&gt; clear to one another.  These positions can be expressed as a ''card table'' (also known as an options board&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=29 definition of Options Board/Card table]&lt;/ref&gt;) of yes/no decisions. For each decision each party communicates what they would like to happen (their ''position''&lt;ref name="posn"/&gt;) and what will happen if they cannot agree (the ''threatened future''). These interactions produce ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; and the ''card table'' changes as players attempt to eliminate these.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation1.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Initial Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The UN threatens to use air strikes, but is not believed by the Bosnian Serbs: The UN has three dilemmas&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; The Bosnians have none]]
Consider the example on the [[:File:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|right]] (Initial Card Table), taken from the [[Bosnian War#1995|1995 Bosnian Conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;This example developed from that described in [[Rupert Smith|Smith R]], Tait A, Howard N (1999) [http://www.decisionmechanics.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/warandpeace.pdf Confrontations in War and Peace]. ''Proceedings of the 6th international Command and Control Research and Technology Symposium'', U.S. Naval Academy, Annapolis, Maryland, 19–20 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; This represents an interaction between the Bosnian Serbs and the United Nations forces over the safe areas. The [[Bosnian Serbs]] had [[Bosniak]] enclaves surrounded and were threatening to attack.

Each side had a position as to what they wanted to happen:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw their heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to take hostages.
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would take hostages if the UN uses air strikes
*The UN said it would initiate air strikes.  However the Bosnian Serbs DID NOT BELIEVE them. (Hence the question mark on the Card Table).

Confrontation analysis then specifies a number of precisely defined ''dilemmas''&lt;ref name="dilemm"/&gt; that occur to the parties following from the structure of the card tables.  It states that motivated by the desire to eliminate these dilemmas, the parties involved will CHANGE THE CARD TABLE, to eliminate their problem.

In the situation at the start the Bosnian Serbs have no dilemmas, but the UN has four. It has three ''persuasion dilemmas''&lt;ref name="pd"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=32 definition of Persuasion Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt; in that the Bosnian Serbs are not going to do the three things they want them to (not attack the enclaves, withdraw the heavy weapons and not take hostages). It also has a ''rejection dilemma''&lt;ref name="rd"&gt;See [http://www.dilemmasgalore.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=40 definition of Rejection Dilemma]&lt;/ref&gt; in that the Bosnian Serbs do not believe they will actually use the air strikes, as they think the UN will submit to their position, for fear of having hostages taken.

Faced with these dilemmas, the UN modified the card table to eliminate its dilemmas.  It took two actions:

Firstly, it withdrew its forces from the positions where they were vulnerable to being taken hostage.  This action eliminated the Bosnian Serbs' option (card) of taking hostages.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation2.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Second Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The UN eliminated the Bosnian "hostage" card and brought in an additional, credible "Artillery" card, changing the situation in their favour: The Bosnian Serbs now have two ''persuasion dilemmas''&lt;ref name="pd"/&gt; and two ''rejection dilemmas''&lt;ref name="rd"/&gt;]]
Secondly, with the addition of the [[Rapid Reaction Force]], and in particular its artillery the UN had an additional capability to engage Bosnian Serb weapons; they added the card "Use artillery against Bosnian Serbs". Because of this, the UN's threat of air strikes became more credible.  The situation changed to that of the Second Card Table:

The Bosnian Serbs wanted (see 4th column):
* To be able to attack the enclaves
* NOT to withdraw heavy weapons from the enclaves
* For the UN NOT to use air strikes
* For the UN NOT to use artillery
The UN wanted (See 5th column):
* The Bosnian Serbs NOT to attack the enclaves
* The Bosnian Serbs to withdraw their heavy weapons
If no further changes were made then what the sides were saying would happen was (see 1st column):
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would attack the enclaves, but the UN did not believe them.
*The Bosnian Serbs said they would NOT withdraw their heavy weapons, but the UN did not believe them.
*The UN said it would use artillery.  The Bosnian Serbs believed this.
*The UN said it would use air strikes.  This time, however, the Bosnian Serbs believed them.

[[Image:BosniaConfrontation3.JPG|thumb|x250px|right|Final Card Table:&lt;ref name="ct"/&gt; The final situation. The Bosnian Serbs modified their position to eliminate their dilemmas. This involved accepting their initial goals as unobtainable]]
Faced with this new situation, the Bosnian Serbs modified their position to accept the UN proposal.  The final table was an agreement as shown in the Final Card table (see thumbnail and picture).

Confrontation analysis does not necessarily produce a win-win solution (although end states are more likely to remain stable if they do); however, the word ''confrontation'' should not necessarily imply that any negotiations should be carried out in an aggressive way.

The ''card tables'' or are isomorphic to [[game theory]] models, but are not built with the aim of finding a ''solution''. Instead, the aim is to find the dilemmas facing characters and so help to predict how they will change the table itself. Such prediction requires not only analysis of the model and its dilemmas, but also exploration of the reality outside the model; without this it is impossible to decide which ways of changing the model in order to eliminate dilemmas might be rationalized by the characters.

Sometimes analysis of the ticks and crosses can be supported by values showing the payoff to each of the parties.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.decisionworkshops.com/#/the-tables-in-a-decision-works/4557003218 understanding the tables used in confrontation analysis]&lt;/ref&gt;

This category can include [[bones]] and [[soft tissue]]s as well as ashes, hair, and teeth.&lt;ref name="Complying with NAGPRA" /&gt; Given the organic nature of the human body, special steps must be taken to halt the deterioration process and maintain the integrity of the remains in their current state.&lt;ref name="Pouliot"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Pouliot|author1-first=Bruno P.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|chapter=Organic Materials|publisher=University Press of New England|location=Hanover|date=2000|pages=45–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of museum artifacts have great merit as tools for education and scientific research, yet also have unique challenges from a cultural and ethical standpoint. Conservation of human remains within museum collections is most often undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]&lt;ref name="Wesche"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Wesche|editor1-first=Anne|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|date=2013|publisher=Deutscher Museumsbund e.V.|location=Germany|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf|accessdate=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[archaeologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Berger|author1-first=Stephanie|title=Treating Bones: The Intersection of Archaeology And Conservation|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan|page=10|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/100180/Berger_Treating_Bones.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other specialists related to this area of conservation include [[Osteology|osteologists]] and [[taxidermists]].

== Types of human remains found in museum collections ==
Museum collections contain human remains in many forms, including entire preserved bodies, discrete parts of the anatomy, and even art and artifacts created out of human body parts.

[[File:Human skull.jpg|thumb|left|Human skull on display at the [[Museum of Osteology]] in Oklahoma City.]]

=== Osteological specimens ===

Museum collections, especially those of the natural history variety, often contain [[osteological]] specimens derived from humans. These can include individual [[bones]], bone fragments, entire [[skeletons]], and [[teeth]] from both ancient and contemporary sources. Reconstruction of bone fragments should be conducted with great care and consideration. Due to the porous nature of bones, few adhering substances can be used on bone with an adequate level of reversibility, which is a key component of all conservation treatments.&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, pp117-118"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=LaRoche|author1-first=Cheryl J.|author2-last=McGowan|author2-first=Gary S.|title=The Ethical Dilemma Facing Conservation: Care and Treatment of Human Skeletal Remains and Mortuary Objects|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=35, No. 2|pages=117–118|date=1996|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/davidson/arch%20of%20death/Week%2014/McGowan%20and%20LaRoche%201996.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mummies and preserved bodies ===
The word "[[mummy]]" can refer to both intentionally and naturally preserved bodies and is not limited to one geographic area or culture.&lt;ref name="David, p113"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=David|author1-first=A. Rosalie|title=Benefits and Disadvantages of Some Conservation Treatments for Egyptian Mummies|date=2001|journal=Chungara: Revista de Antropología Chilena|page=113|publisher=Universidad de Tarapaca|jstor=27802173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damage of mummified remains can be caused by several main factors, including poor environmental conditions, physical damage, and improper methods of preservation that have been applied in the past.&lt;ref name="David, p113" /&gt;

==== Mummies ====
[[Mummies]], though most often thought of as an Egyptian phenomenon, exist in many cultures and have been found on nearly every continent. For examples of non-Egyptian mummies, see "[[Mummies#Mummification in other cultures|Mummification in other cultures]]".

Controlling environmental conditions is highly important in preserving the integrity of mummies. Fungi, pests, and  microorganisms that cause decay are some of the possible repercussions of inadequate storage and environmental factors. There are a number of ways to mitigate the effects of improper conditions, however. Methods of stabilizing mummies and halting the deterioration process include [[inert gas]] control, where the mummy is placed in a chamber or bag into which [[fumigants]] are introduced; wet sterilization, where solutions are applied to the mummy to repel insects and the growth of fungi; controlled drying, which reduces the relative humidity in order to stop growth of microorganisms; and ultra-violet [[irradiation]], which affects microorganisms by altering their cells.&lt;ref name="David, p114"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=David|author1-first=A. Rosalie|title=Benefits and Disadvantages of Some Conservation Treatments for Egyptian Mummies|date=2001|journal=Chungara: Revista de Antropología Chilena|page=114|publisher=Universidad de Tarapaca|jstor=27802173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some previous treatments which were thought to help in the preservation of mummified remains but ultimately led to further damage include curing the remains by smoking them and applying solutions of copper salts to exposed skin.&lt;ref name="David, p113" /&gt;

For examples and images of mummy preservation, see the [http://www.penn.museum/sites/artifactlab/ Artifact Lab] at the [[Penn Museum]], which provides insight into ongoing conservation projects for mummies in their collection and their related artifacts.

==== Bog bodies ====
[[File:Huldremosekvinnan.jpg|thumb|Bog body of the Huldremose Woman, on display at the [[National Museum of Denmark]].]]
[[Bog Body|Bog Bodies]] are human remains which have been found in peat bogs in various locations around the world. They have been preserved naturally in varying degrees due to the specific conditions of peat bogs. Despite their natural preservation, these remains are sensitive to deterioration after being removed from their original locations. Freeze-drying is an accepted method of preserving bog bodies in museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Omar|author1-first=S.|author2-last=McCord|author2-first=M.|author3-last=Daniels|author3-first=V.|title=The Conservation of Bog Bodies by Freeze-Drying|date=1989|journal=Studies in Conservation|volume=34, No. 3|pages=101–109|publisher=Maney Publishing|jstor=1506225}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some notable bog body discoveries include the [[Tollund Man]] of Denmark, the [[Elling Woman]] of Denmark, the [[Cashel Man]] of Ireland, the [[Huldremose Woman]] of Denmark, the [[Girl of the Uchter Moor]] of Germany, the [[Lindow Man]] of England, and the [[Yde Girl]] of the Netherlands. For a more comprehensive list of examples, see [[List of bog bodies]].

A record of the preservation of the Tollund Man's head, which took place in 1951 and involved replacing the bog water in the cells with liquid paraffin wax, can be read on the [http://www.tollundman.dk/konservering.asp Tollund Man's website] hosted by the Silkeborg Public Library, [[Silkeborg Museum]], and Amtscentret for Undervisning.

=== Other human remains in museums ===
There are innumerable types of artifacts present in museum collections that include or are composed of human remains, some with great scientific or medical merit and others with great cultural importance. Not only do the body parts vary greatly, but their methods of preservation do as well.
[[File:A tattoo on a piece of human skin showing a lady Wellcome L0036394.jpg|thumb|One of the many preserved tattoos on a section of human skin in the [[Wellcome Collection]].]]

==== Soft tissues ====
Soft tissues are usually in some sort of state of preservation prior to entering a museum collection, but still require periodic care.

* Plastination: One method of preserving tissues is [[plastination]], invented by [[Gunther von Hagens]] and made famous by the exhibition [[Body Worlds]]. The process of plastination involves replacing the water and fat of a specimen with a curable polymer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=von Hagens|author1-first=Gunther|author2-last=Tiedemann|author2-first=Klaus|author3-last=Kriz|author3-first=Wilhelm|date=1987|title=The current potential of plastination|journal=Anatomy and Embryology|issue=175|volume=4|pages=411–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of preservation requires little upkeep in terms of conservation, outside of periodic surface cleaning. 
* Wet specimens: A more classic form of soft tissue preservation is in a solution of [[formaldehyde]], creating what is known as a wet specimen. The [[Mütter Museum]] in Philadelphia, PA has an extensive [http://muttermuseum.org/collections/wet-specimens/ collection of wet specimens] of human body parts, including both normal specimens and medical abnormalities. Care and hazards of wet specimens can be found on the website of the [http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/health-safety/fluid-preserved-specimens American Museum of Natural History].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/our-research/natural-science-collections-conservation/general-conservation/health-safety/fluid-preserved-specimens|title=Fluid Preserved Specimens|publisher=American Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Skin ====
Sections of human skin can be found in the collections of some museums. Some examples of this include books bound with human skin ([[anthropodermic bibliopegy]]) and preserved tattoos. The largest collection of the latter can be found in the [[Wellcome Collection]] at the [[Science Museum, London]].&lt;br /&gt;
American artist Andrew Krasnow has caused controversy in recent decades by creating pieces of contemporary art made of human skin. His works, which often make political statements, are composed of pieces of flesh from individuals who have donated their bodies to science. The skin itself has been preserved through the process of tanning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1-last=Johnson|author1-first=Andrew|title=Body art. Literally|publisher=Independent|date=23 October 2011|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/body-art-literally-1690128.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Hair ====
Hair is considered human remains by some definitions, but not all. It is not uncommon within museum collections due to the trend of creating "hairwork", most popular during the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Hair Art|publisher=Leila's Hair Museum|url=http://www.leilashairmuseum.net/history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Locks of hair, hair wreaths, and jewelry made of hair are some of the most commonly found forms.

== Caring for human remains ==
Though there is great variety in human remains within museum collections as well as the ways in which they can be preserved, there are a number of best practices to be observed in the [[preventive care]] of these types of artifacts. Preventive care is the best method of preserving human remains in the long term, as active conservation work should be limited both by conservators' policy to interfere as little as possible and the beliefs of many indigenous tribes and groups who disapprove of altering human remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Berger|author1-first=Stephanie|title=Treating Bones: The Intersection of Archaeology And Conservation|date=2013|page=29|publisher=University of Michigan|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/100180/Berger_Treating_Bones.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage ===
One of the greatest threats to the long-term well being of human remains in museum collections is improper storage and packing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Berger|author1-first=Stephanie|title=Treating Bones: The Intersection of Archaeology And Conservation|date=2013|page=34|publisher=University of Michigan|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/100180/Berger_Treating_Bones.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper storage of human remains is not only necessary for their physical preservation, but it also demonstrates the respect that sensitive materials such as these should be accorded.&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, p116"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=LaRoche|author1-first=Cheryl J.|author2-last=McGowan|author2-first=Gary S.|title=The Ethical Dilemma Facing Conservation: Care and Treatment of Human Skeletal Remains and Mortuary Objects|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=35, No. 2|page=116|date=1996|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/davidson/arch%20of%20death/Week%2014/McGowan%20and%20LaRoche%201996.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ideal storage location for sacred artifacts and human remains is a designated space away from the rest of the collection; however, there are often many constraints which prevent this from being possible.&lt;ref name="Wesche, p53"&gt;{{cite news|author=Deutscher Museums Bund|date=April 2013|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|page=53|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the minimum, ethical guidelines suggest that remains from different individuals should be stored in separate boxes or compartments from each other.&lt;ref name="Wesche, p52"&gt;{{cite news|author=Deutscher Museums Bund|date=April 2013|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|pages=52|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Generally speaking, human remains are best preserved in cool, dark, dry conditions while wrapped in acid-free (non-buffered) tissue and packing materials.&lt;ref name="Preserving Ethnographic Objects"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Rose|author1-first=Carolyn L.|title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|chapter=Preserving Ethnographic Objects|publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=Washington, D.C.|date=1992|pages=117–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Corporeal materials should not be stored in or near any wood or in any containers which previously housed wood due to potentially increased [[lignin]] levels, which produce an acid that can lead to the deterioration of DNA and proteins in the remains.&lt;ref name="Wesche, p52" /&gt; Excessive exposure to light should be avoided in order to prevent bleaching of materials, especially bone.&lt;ref name="Pouliot" /&gt;

=== Temperature and relative humidity ===
Organic materials are porous by nature, which means that they are greatly affected by changes in the moisture levels of their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Pouliot" /&gt; Overly moist conditions can lead to growth of fungi on protein materials like human remains, which is one of the most common risks they face.&lt;ref name="Preserving Ethnographic Objects" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=Berger|author1-first=Stephanie|title=Treating Bones: The Intersection of Archaeology And Conservation|date=2013|publisher=University of Michigan|url=http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/100180/Berger_Treating_Bones.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternately, low-humidity conditions can potentially cause protein materials to crack, split, and shrink.&lt;ref name="Preserving Ethnographic Objects" /&gt;
Ideal storage conditions for bones is 35% to 55% relative humidity with minimal fluctuations,&lt;ref name="Pouliot" /&gt; while ideal conditions for the preservation of mummies are 50 to 59 degrees Fahrenheit (10 to 15 degrees Celsius) with a relative humidity of 40% to 55%.&lt;ref name="David, p113" /&gt;

=== Handling ===
Embrittlement is a risk for many human remains, and as a result handling should be limited. When possible, artifacts should be lifted by their storage container or tray. To avoid transfer of oils to the remains, nitrile or latex gloves should be worn during their handling. If a body is to be lifted, it must be supported under all of its appendages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Neilson|author1-first=Dixie|chapter=Object Handling|title=Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition|editor1-last=Buck|editor1-first=Rebecca|editor2-last=Gilmore|editor2-first=Jean Allman|date=2010|pages=209–218|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cleaning ===
Cleaning of human remains varies by type. If necessary, surface cleaning of bone can be done with a very mild detergent and water solution, but bones should never be soaked in order to prevent dirt from becoming embedded in pores.&lt;ref name="Pouliot" /&gt; The possibility of cleaning human remains is highly dependent on the fragility of the specimen.

== Cultural and ethical considerations ==
There are many challenges surrounding human remains accessioned by museums, including legal complications involved in dealing with human remains, involvement of living relatives or tribes, and potential repatriation and issues such as [[NAGPRA]].&lt;ref name="Complying with NAGPRA"&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=McKeown|author1-first=C. Timothy|author2-last=Murphy|author2-first=Amanda|author3-last=Schansberg|author3-first=Jennifer|chapter=Complying with NAGPRA|title=Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition|editor1-last=Buck|editor1-first=Rebecca|editor2-last=Gilmore|editor2-first=Jean Allman|date=2010|pages=449–457|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NAGPRA|The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] of 1990 requires any federal or federally-funded institution, with the exception of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], to submit full inventories of their Native American funerary and sacred objects and human remains and to repatriate these objects to their tribe of origin should a request be made to do so.&lt;ref name="Complying with NAGPRA" /&gt; Should a museum possess human remains which have a direct living relative or group (Native American or otherwise), it is their ethical obligation to involve these individuals in the care and treatment of the remains.&lt;ref name="Wesche, pp54-55"&gt;{{cite news|author=Deutscher Museums Bund|date=April 2013|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|pages=54–55|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acquisition of human remains by museums can happen in a number of ways, some of which are considered to be unethical today. Many museums have human remains in their collections which have been there for over a hundred years, in which case they may likely have been acquired in ethically or morally unsound ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1-last=Edwards|author1-first=Alison|chapter=Care of Sacred and Culturally Sensitive Objects|title=Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition|editor1-last=Buck|editor1-first=Rebecca|editor2-last=Gilmore|editor2-first=Jean Allman|date=2010|pages=408|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.11141/ia.45.5 | issue=45 | title=The Insta-Dead: The rhetoric of the human remains trade on Instagram | year=2017 | journal=Internet Archaeology | author=Huffer Damien, Graham Shawn }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most institutions and museum associations have their own policies on the acquisition of human remains. Some guidelines for the care of human remains including acceptable means of acquisition can be found below.

=== Scientific analyses ===
Cultural considerations can sometimes interfere with the conservation of human remains, particularly when it comes to physical and chemical analyses, which play an important role in their care.&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, p109"&gt;{{cite news|author1-last=LaRoche|author1-first=Cheryl J.|author2-last=McGowan|author2-first=Gary S.|title=The Ethical Dilemma Facing Conservation: Care and Treatment of Human Skeletal Remains and Mortuary Objects|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|volume=35, No. 2|page=109|date=1996|url=http://users.clas.ufl.edu/davidson/arch%20of%20death/Week%2014/McGowan%20and%20LaRoche%201996.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testing conducted on human remains, especially ancient ones, can include [[DNA testing]], [[Isotope analysis|isotope analyses]], and [[carbon 14 dating]].&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, p109" /&gt; The benefits of such testing is sometimes outweighed by the cultural or sacred importance of the remains as well as the risk of damaging them too greatly.&lt;ref name="LaRoche McGowan, p109" /&gt; According to the Deutscher Museumsbund, there are only three circumstances in which scientific research should be conducted on human remains:
# there is a great deal of scientific interest
# the human remains have a known provenance, and
# the method of acquisition of the human remains is no source for concern.&lt;ref name="Wesche, p55"&gt;{{cite news|author=Deutscher Museums Bund|date=April 2013|title=Recommendations for the Care of Human Remains in Museums and Collections|pages=55|url=http://www.museumsbund.de/fileadmin/geschaefts/dokumente/Leitfaeden_und_anderes/2013__Recommendations_for_the_Care_of_Human_Remains.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Case study ====
The [[Kennewick Man]] is a notable example of human remains caught in a struggle between scientific merit and cultural traditions. Since his discovery in 1996, his fate has been the topic of great controversy. As one of the oldest well-preserved ancient skeletons found in America, scientists are eager to conduct various testing on the remains. Native American groups, however, have been adamantly calling for his repatriation and reburial, as per their traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1-last=Preston|author1-first=Douglas|date=September 2014|title=The Kennewick Man Finally Freed to Share His Secrets|publisher=Smithsonian Magazine|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/kennewick-man-finally-freed-share-his-secrets-180952462/?no-ist=&amp;preview=_page%3D3_page%3D3_no-ist_page%3D2_page%3D2_page%3D2_page%3D2&amp;page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Types of empathy include cognitive empathy, emotional empathy, and [[Wiktionary:somatic#Etymology|somatic]] empathy.&lt;ref name="Rothschild, B. 2006"&gt;Rothschild, B. (with Rand, M. L.). (2006).

== Etymology ==
The English word ''empathy'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word εμπάθεια (''empatheia'', meaning "physical affection or passion"). This, in turn, comes from εν (''en'', "in, at") and πάθος (''[[pathos]]'', "passion" or "suffering").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%2334198 Empatheia, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', at Perseus]&lt;/ref&gt; The term was adapted by [[Hermann Lotze]] and [[Robert Vischer]] to create the German word ''Einfühlung'' ("feeling into"), which was translated by [[Edward B. Titchener]] into the English term empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Titchener E.B. (1909/2014) [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf Introspection and empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726132552/http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-E14-01.pdf |date=July 26, 2014 }} Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences  2014; 7: 25–30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| citeseerx=10.1.1.143.2396 | first = Vittorio | last = Gallese | year = 2003 | title = The Roots of Empathy: The Shared Manifold Hypothesis and the Neural Basis of Intersubjectivity | journal = Psychopathology | volume = 36 | pages = 171–180 | doi = 10.1159/000072786 | pmid=14504450 | issue = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in modern Greek, εμπάθεια means "malice", "hostility".

''[[Alexithymia]]'' is a word used to describe a deficiency in understanding, processing or describing emotions ''in oneself'' as opposed to in others.&lt;ref name="Bar-On"&gt;Bar-On, Reuven; Parker, James DA (2000). ''The Handbook of Emotional Intelligence: Theory, Development, Assessment, and Application at Home, School, and in the Workplace''. San Francisco, California: Jossey-Bass. {{ISBN|0-7879-4984-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This term comes from the combination of two Ancient Greek words: ἀλέξω (''alekso'', meaning "push away, repel, or protect") and ''θυμός'' (''thymos'', meaning "the soul, as the seat of emotion, feeling and thought"). Thus alexithymia literally means "pushing away your emotions".

== Definitions ==

Empathy definitions encompass a broad range of emotional states, including caring for other people and having a desire to help them; experiencing emotions that match another person's emotions; discerning what another person is thinking or feeling;&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=G H M Pijnenborg, G.H.M. |author2=Spikman, J.M. |author3=Jeronimus, B.F. |author4=Aleman, A. |year=2012|title= Insight in schizophrenia: associations with empathy |journal= European Archives of Psychiatry and Clinical Neuroscience|volume=263|issue=4|pages=299–307|url= https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|doi=10.1007/s00406-012-0373-0|pmid=23076736}}&lt;/ref&gt; and making less distinct the differences between the self and the other.&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, S.D., &amp; Klein, K.J.

''Journal of Socio-Economics''.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be understood as having the separateness of defining oneself and another a blur.&lt;ref name="Decety, J" /&gt;

It also is the ability to feel and share another person's emotions. Some believe that empathy involves the ability to match another's emotions, while others believe that empathy involves being tenderhearted toward another person.&lt;ref name="Snyder, C. R. 2011"&gt;Snyder, C. R., Shane J. Lopez, and Jennifer T. Pedrotti. Positive Psychology: The Scientific and Practical Explorations of Human Strengths. Second ed. Los Angeles: SAGE, 2011. 267–75. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having empathy can include having the understanding that there are many factors that go into decision making and cognitive thought processes. Past experiences have an influence on the decision making of today. Understanding this allows a person to have empathy for individuals who sometimes make illogical decisions to a problem that most individuals would respond with an obvious response. Broken homes, childhood trauma, lack of parenting and many others factors can influence the connections in the brain which a person uses to make decisions in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dietrich|first1=Cindy|title=Decision Making: Factors that Influence Decision Making, Heuristics Used, and Decision Outcomes|url=https://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|website=Inquiries Journal|publisher=Inquiries Journal/Student Pulse LLC|accessdate=6 February 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003124530/http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/180/decision-making-factors-that-influence-decision-making-heuristics-used-and-decision-outcomes?ab=hb|archivedate=October 3, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Hoffman]] is a psychologist who studied the development of empathy. According to Hoffman everyone is born with the capability of feeling empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roth-Hanania|first=Ronit|last2=Davidov|first2=Maayan|last3=Zahn-Waxler|first3=Carolyn|date=2011-06-01|title=Empathy development from 8 to 16 months: Early signs of concern for others|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163638311000506|journal=Infant Behavior and Development|volume=34|issue=3|pages=447–458|doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2011.04.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Compassion]] and [[sympathy]] are terms associated with empathy.  Definitions vary, contributing to the challenge of defining empathy. Compassion is often defined as an emotion we feel when others are in need, which motivates us to help them. Sympathy is a feeling of care and understanding for someone in need. Some include in sympathy an [[empathic concern]], a feeling of concern for another, in which some scholars include the wish to see them better off or happier.&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"&gt;Batson, C.D. (2009). These things called empathy: Eight related but distinct phenomena. In J. Decety and W. Ickes (Eds.), The Social Neuroscience of Empathy (pp.&amp;nbsp;3–15). Cambridge: [[MIT Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Empathy is distinct also from [[pity]] and [[emotional contagion]].&lt;ref name="Batson, C.D. 2009 pp. 3"/&gt; Pity is feeling that another is in trouble and in need of help as they cannot fix their problems themselves, often described as "feeling sorry" for someone. Emotional contagion is when a person (especially an infant or a member of a [[crowd|mob]]) imitatively "catches" the emotions that others are showing without necessarily recognizing this is happening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hatfield E. |author2=Cacioppo J. L. |author3=Rapson R. L. |year=1993 |title=Emotional contagion |url=http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=96–99 |doi=10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119002643/http://www.elainehatfield.com/ch50.pdf |archivedate=November 19, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since empathy involves understanding the emotional states of other people, the way it is characterized is derived from the way emotions themselves are characterized. If, for example, emotions are taken to be centrally characterized by bodily feelings, then grasping the bodily feelings of another will be central to empathy. On the other hand, if emotions are more centrally characterized by a combination of beliefs and desires, then grasping these beliefs and desires will be more essential to empathy. The ability to imagine oneself as another person is a sophisticated imaginative process. However, the basic capacity to recognize emotions is probably innate&lt;ref name="Baird, James D., and Laurie Nadel, 2010"&gt;Happiness Genes: Unlock the Positive Potential Hidden in Your DNA, New Page Books (April, 2010) {{ISBN|978-1-60163-105-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be achieved unconsciously. Yet it can be trained&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = O'Malley W. J. | year = 1999 | title = Teaching Empathy | url = | journal = America | volume = 180 | issue = 12| pages = 22–26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved with various degrees of intensity or accuracy.

Empathy necessarily has a "more or less" quality. The paradigm case of an empathic interaction, however, involves a person communicating an accurate recognition of the significance of another person's ongoing intentional actions, associated emotional states, and personal characteristics in a manner that the recognized person can tolerate. Recognitions that are both accurate and tolerable are central features of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2002 | title = From passivity to competence: A conceptualization of knowledge, skill, tolerance, and empathy | url = | journal = Psychiatry | volume = 65 | issue = 4| pages = 338–345 | doi=10.1521/psyc.65.4.338.20239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Schwartz W | year = 2013 | title = The parameters of empathy: Core considerations for psychotherapy and supervision | doi = 10.2139/ssrn.2393689 | journal = Advances in Descriptive Psychology | volume = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The human capacity to recognize the bodily feelings of another is related to one's imitative capacities, and seems to be grounded in an innate capacity to associate the bodily movements and facial expressions one sees in another with the [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] feelings of producing those corresponding movements or expressions oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Meltzoff A.N. |author2=Decety J. | year = 2003 | title = What imitation tells us about social cognition: A rapprochement between developmental psychology and cognitive neuroscience | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 358 | issue = 1431| pages = 491–500 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.2002.1261 | pmid=12689375 | pmc=1351349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans seem to make the same immediate connection between the tone of voice and other vocal expressions and inner feeling.

In the field of positive psychology, empathy has also been compared with altruism and egotism. Altruism is behavior that is aimed at benefitting another person, while egotism is a behavior that is acted out for personal gain. Sometimes, when someone is feeling empathetic towards another person, acts of altruism occur. However, many question whether or not these acts of altruism are motivated by egotistical gains. According to positive psychologists, people can be adequately moved by their empathies to be [[altruistic]].&lt;ref name="Snyder, C.

== Classification and types of empathy ==

Empathy is generally divided into two major components:&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rogers K, Dziobek I, Hassenstab J, Wolf OT, Convit A | date = Apr 2007 | title = Who cares?

{{vanchor|Affective empathy}}, also called ''emotional empathy'':&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt; the capacity to respond with an appropriate emotion to another's mental states.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; Our ability to empathize emotionally is based on emotional contagion:&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt; being affected by another's emotional or arousal state.&lt;ref name="Waal2008"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.life.umd.edu/faculty/wilkinson/BIOL608W/deWaalAnnRevPsych2008.pdf | title=Putting the Altruism Back into Altruism: The Evolution of Empathy | author=Frans B.M. deWaal | journal=Annu.

Affective empathy can be subdivided into the following scales:&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

== Development of empathy ==

=== Evolutionary development across species ===

An increasing number of studies in [[ethology|animal behavior]] and [[neuroscience]] claim that empathy is not restricted to humans, and is in fact as old as the mammals, or perhaps older. Examples include [[dolphin]]s saving humans from drowning or from [[shark attack]]s. Professor Tom White suggests that reports of [[cetacea]]ns having three times as many spindle cells — the nerve cells that convey empathy — in their brains as we do might mean these highly-social animals have a great awareness of one another's feelings.&lt;ref&gt;White, T. I. (2007). In defense of dolphins: the new moral frontier. Malden, MA: Blackwell Pub..&lt;/ref&gt;

A multitude of behaviors has been observed in [[primate]]s, both in captivity and in the wild, and in particular in [[bonobo]]s, which are reported as the most empathetic of all the primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandin|first=Jo|title=Bonobos: Encounters in Empathy|year=2007|publisher=Zoological Society of Milwaukee &amp; The Foundation for Wildlife Conservation, Inc.|location=Milwaukee|isbn=978-0-9794151-0-4|page=109|url=https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161124025312/https://www.amazon.com/Bonobos-Encounters-Empathy-Jo-Sandin/dp/0979415101|archivedate=November 24, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The age of empathy: nature's lessons for a kinder society By: Waal, F.

He argues that there is strong evidence that empathy has deep evolutionary, biochemical, and neurological underpinnings, and that even the most advanced forms of empathy in humans are built on more basic forms and remain connected to core mechanisms associated with affective communication, social [[attachment theory|attachment]], and [[parental care]].&lt;ref name="Decety, J"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Decety J | year = 2011 | title = The neuroevolution of empathy | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1231 | issue = 1| pages = 35–45 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2011.06027.x | pmid=21651564|bibcode = 2011NYASA1231...35D }}&lt;/ref&gt; Core neural circuits that are involved in empathy and caring include the [[brainstem]], the [[amygdala]], [[hypothalamus]], [[basal ganglia]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[orbitofrontal cortex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Svetlova M. | year = 2012 | title = Putting together phylogenetic and ontogenetic perspectives on empathy | url = | journal = Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 1–24 | doi = 10.1016/j.dcn.2011.05.003 | pmid = 22682726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since all definitions of empathy involves an element of for others, all distinctions between egoism and empathy fail at least for beings lacking self-awareness. Since the first [[mammal]]s lacked a self-aware distinction between self and other, as shown by most mammals failing at [[mirror test]]s, the first mammals or anything more evolutionarily primitive than them cannot have had a context of default egoism requiring an empathy mechanism to be transcended. However, there are numerous examples in artificial intelligence research showing that simple reactions can carry out de facto functions the agents have no concept of, so this does not contradict evolutionary explanations of parental care. However, such mechanisms would be unadapted to self-other distinction and beings already dependent on some form of behavior benefitting each other or their offspring would never be able to evolve a form of self-other distinction that necessitated evolution of specialized non-preevolved and non-preevolvable mechanisms for retaining empathic behavior in the presence of self-other distinction, and so a fundamental neurological distinction between egoism and empathy cannot exist in any species.&lt;ref&gt;How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, 2006, by Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Intelligence of Apes and Other Rational Beings 2003, Duane M.

=== Ontogenetic development in the individual ===
By the age of two years, children normally begin to display the fundamental behaviors of empathy by having an emotional response that corresponds with another person's emotional state.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, M.L. (2000). ''Empathy and Moral Development''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even earlier, at one year of age, infants have some rudiments of empathy, in the sense that they understand that, just like their own actions, other people's actions have goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Meyer M. | year = 2008 | title = From emotion resonance to empathic understanding: A social developmental neuroscience account | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 20 | issue = 4| pages = 1053–1080 | doi = 10.1017/S0954579408000503 | pmid = 18838031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, N., Spinrad, T.L., &amp; Sadovsky, A.

''Nature Neuroscience'', 9&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, [[toddler]]s will comfort others or show concern for them at as early an age as two. Also during the second year, toddlers will play games of falsehood or "pretend" in an effort to fool others, and this requires that the child know what others believe before he or she can manipulate those beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zahn-Waxler C. |author2=Radke-Yarrow M. | year = 1990 | title = The origins of empathic concern | url = | journal = Motivation and Emotion | volume = 14 | issue = 2| pages = 107–130 | doi = 10.1007/BF00991639 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to develop these traits, it is essential to expose your child to face-to-face interactions and opportunities and lead them away from a [[sedentary lifestyle]].

According to researchers at the [[University of Chicago]] who used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), children between the ages of 7 and 12 years appear to be naturally inclined to feel empathy for others in pain. Their findings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Decety J. |author2=Michalska K.J. |author3=Akitsuki Y. | year = 2008 | title = Who caused the pain?

The research also found additional aspects of the brain were activated when youngsters saw another person intentionally hurt by another individual, including regions involved in moral reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ Brain Scans Show Children Naturally Prone to Empathy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102202203/http://newswise.com/articles/view/542456/ |date=January 2, 2009 }} Newswise. Retrieved July 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being able to show some signs of empathy, including attempting to comfort a crying baby, from as early as 18 months to two years, most children do not show a fully fledged [[theory of mind]] until around the age of four.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wimmer H. |author2=Perner J. | year = 1983 | title = Beliefs about beliefs: representation and constraining function of wrong beliefs in young children's understanding of deception | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103–28 | doi = 10.1016/0010-0277(83)90004-5 | pmid = 6681741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Theory of mind involves the ability to understand that other people may have beliefs that are different from one's own, and is thought to involve the cognitive component of empathy.&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; Children usually become capable of passing "false belief" tasks, considered to be a test for a theory of mind, around the age of four. Individuals with [[autism]] often find using a theory of mind very difficult (e.g. Baron-Cohen, Leslie &amp; Frith, 1988; the [[Sally-Anne test]]).

Empathetic maturity is a cognitive structural theory developed at the Yale University School of Nursing and addresses how adults conceive or understand the personhood of patients. The theory, first applied to nurses and since applied to other professions, postulates three levels that have the properties of cognitive structures. The third and highest level is held to be a meta-ethical theory of the moral structure of care. Those adults operating with level-III understanding synthesize systems of justice and care-based ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olsen|first=Douglas|title=Empathetic Maturity: Theory of Moral Point of View in Clinical Relations|journal=Advances in Nursing Science|date=September 2001|volume=24|issue=1|pages=36–46|url=http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|pmid=11554532|doi=10.1097/00012272-200109000-00006|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907234403/http://www.nursingcenter.com/library/JournalArticle.asp?Article_ID=430999|archivedate=September 7, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major theories and empirical findings ==

=== Influence of empathy on helping behavior ===
Emotions motivate individual behavior that aids in solving communal challenges as well as guiding group decisions about social exchange. Additionally, recent research has shown individuals who report regular experiences of gratitude engage more frequently in prosocial behaviors. Positive emotions like empathy or gratitude are linked to a more positive continual state and these people are far more likely to help others than those not experiencing a positive emotional state.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006" /&gt; Thus, empathy's influence extends beyond relating to other's emotions, it correlates with an increased positive state and likeliness to aid others. Measures of empathy show that mirror neurons are activated during arousal of sympathetic responses and prolonged activation shows increased probability to help others.

Research investigating the social response to natural disasters looked at the characteristics associated with individuals who help victims. Researchers found that cognitive empathy, rather than emotional empathy, predicted helping behavior towards victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marjanovic|first=Zdravko|author2=Struthers, Greenglass |title=Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims? Assessment of Trait and Situational Predictors|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=August 8, 2011|volume=12|issue=1|pages=245–267|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2011.01262.x/asset/asap1262.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvu9nj&amp;s=2892713f7a99d42574ccda68fa2bbfc1c1578249}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have posited that taking on the perspectives of others (cognitive empathy) allows these individuals to better empathize with victims without as much discomfort, whereas sharing the emotions of the victims (emotional empathy) can cause emotional distress, helplessness, victim-blaming, and ultimately can lead to avoidance rather than helping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Einolf|first=Christopher|title=Is Cognitive Empathy More Important than Affective Empathy? A Response to "Who Helps Natural-Disaster Victims?"|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|date=March 13, 2012|volume=12|issue=1|pages=268–271|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1530-2415.2012.01281.x/asset/asap1281.pdf?v=1&amp;t=hvtvq647&amp;s=df598d6cfad7025a88420f2f5c207c0c980672fa|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, despite this evidence for empathy-induced altruistic motivation, egoistic explanations may still be possible. For example, one alternative explanation for the problem-specific helping pattern may be that the sequence of events in the same problem condition first made subjects sad when they empathized with the problem and then maintained or enhanced subjects’ sadness when they were later exposed to the same plight. Consequently, the negative state relief model would predict substantial helping among imagine-set subjects in the same condition, which is what occurred. An intriguing question arises from such findings concerning whether it is possible to have mixed motivations for helping. If this is the case, then simultaneous egoistic and altruistic motivations would occur. This would allow for a stronger sadness-based motivation to obscure the effects of an empathic concern-based altruistic motivation. The observed study would then have sadness as less intense than more salient altruistic motivation. Consequently, relative strengths of different emotional reactions, systematically related to the need situation, may moderate the predominance of egoistic or altruistic motivation (Dovidio, 1990). But it has been shown that researchers in this area who have used very similar procedures sometimes obtain apparently contradictory results. Superficial procedural differences such as precisely when a manipulation is introduced could also lead to divergent results and conclusions. It is therefore vital for any future research to move toward even greater standardization of measurement. Thus, an important step in solving the current theoretical debate concerning the existence of altruism may involve reaching common methodological ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dovidio J.F. |author2=Allen J.L. |author3=Schroeder D.A. | year = 1990 | title = Specificity of empathy-induced helping: Evidence for altruistic motivation | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 59 | issue = 2| pages = 249–260 | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=buy.optionToBuy&amp;id=1991-01135-001 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.59.2.249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuroscientific basis of empathy ===
Contemporary neuroscience has allowed us to understand the neural basis of the human mind's ability to understand and process emotion. Studies today enable us to see the activation of mirror neurons and attempt to explain the basic processes of empathy. By isolating these mirror neurons and measuring the neural basis for human mind reading and emotion sharing abilities,&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Keen | first = Suzanne | year = 2006 | title = A Theory of Narrative Empathy | url = | journal = Narrative | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 207–36 | doi=10.1353/nar.2006.0015}}&lt;/ref&gt; science has come one step closer to finding the reason for reactions like empathy. Neuroscientists have already discovered that people scoring high on empathy tests have especially busy mirror neuron systems in their brains (Dr. Christian Keysers). {{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}  Empathy is a spontaneous sharing of affect, provoked by witnessing and sympathizing with another's emotional state. In a way we mirror or mimic the emotional response that we would expect to feel in that condition or context, much like sympathy. Unlike personal distress, empathy is not characterized by aversion to another's emotional response. Additionally, empathizing with someone requires a distinctly sympathetic reaction where personal distress demands avoidance of distressing matters. This distinction is vital because empathy is associated with the moral emotion sympathy, or empathetic concern, and consequently also prosocial or altruistic action.&lt;ref name="Keen Suzanne 2006 207–36"/&gt; Empathy leads to sympathy by definition unlike the over-aroused emotional response that turns into personal distress and causes a turning-away from another's distress.

In empathy we feel what we believe are the emotions of another, which makes it both affective and cognitive by most psychologists.&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt; In this sense, arousal and empathy promote prosocial behavior as we accommodate each other to feel similar emotions. For social beings, negotiating interpersonal decisions is as important to survival as being able to navigate the physical landscape.&lt;ref name="Bartlett, M. 2006"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bartlett M.

=== Gender differences ===
The literature commonly indicates that females tend to have more cognitive empathy than males. On average, female subjects score higher than males on the [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ), while males tend to score higher on the [[Systemizing Quotient]] (SQ). Both males and females with [[Autism spectrum|autistic spectrum disorders]] usually score lower on the EQ and higher on SQ ([[#Autism|see below]] for more detail on autism and empathy).&lt;ref name="Baron-Cohen, 2003"/&gt; However, a series of studies, using a variety of neurophysiological measures, including [[Magnetoencephalography|MEG]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheng Y. |author2=Tzeng O.J. |author3=Decety J. |author4=Hsieh J.C. | year = 2006 | title = Gender differences in the human mirror system: a magnetoencephalography study | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 1115–1119 | doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000223393.59328.21 | pmid=16837838}}&lt;/ref&gt; spinal reflex excitability,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Cheng Y. |author2=Decety J. |author3=Hsieh J.C. |author4=Hung D. |author5=Tzeng O.J. | year = 2007 | title = Gender differences in spinal excitability during observation of bipedal locomotion | url = | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 18 | issue = 9| pages = 887–890 | doi=10.1097/WNR.0b013e3280ebb486 | pmid=17515795}}&lt;/ref&gt; electroencephalography&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yang C.Y. |author2=Decety J. |author3=Lee S. |author4=Chen G. |author5=Cheng Y. | year = 2009 | title = Gender differences in the Mu rhythm during empathy for pain: An electroencephalographic study | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 1251 | issue = | pages = 176–184 | doi = 10.1016/j.brainres.2008.11.062 | pmid = 19083993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cheng Y., Lee P., Yang C.Y., Lin C.P., Decety J. | year = 2008 | title = Gender differences in the mu rhythm of the human mirror-neuron system | url = | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 3 | issue = 5| page = e2113 | bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.2113C | last2 = Lee | last3 = Yang | last4 = Lin | last5 = Hung | last6 = Decety | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0002113 | editor1-last = Rustichini | editor1-first = Aldo | pmid=18461176 | pmc=2361218}}&lt;/ref&gt; and N400 paradigm&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = When neurons do not mirror the agent's intentions: Sex differences in neural coding of goal-directed actions|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41190212_When_neurons_do_not_mirror_the_agent's_intentions_Sex_differences_in_neural_coding_of_goal-directed_actions|journal = Neuropsychologia|pages = 1454–1463|volume = 48|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2010.01.015|first = Alice Mado|last = Proverbio|first2 = Federica|last2 = Riva|first3 = Alberto|last3 = Zani|year = 2010|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170908202105/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/41190212_When_neurons_do_not_mirror_the_agent%27s_intentions_Sex_differences_in_neural_coding_of_goal-directed_actions|archivedate = September 8, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; have documented the presence of an overall gender difference in the human mirror neuron system, with female participants tending to exhibit stronger motor resonance than male participants.

A review published in the journal ''[[Neuropsychologia]]'' found that women tended to be better at recognizing facial effects, expression processing and emotions in general.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A review on sex differences in processing emotional signals|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393212000024|journal = Neuropsychologia|date = 2012-06-01|pages = 1211–1221|volume = 50|issue = 7|doi = 10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.12.022|first = M.

Using [[fMRI]], neuroscientist [[Tania Singer]] showed that empathy-related neural responses tended to be significantly lower in males when observing an "unfair" person experiencing pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Singer T, Seymour B, O'Doherty JP, Stephan KE, Dolan RJ, Frith CD |date=Jan 2006 | title = Empathic neural responses are modulated by the perceived fairness of others | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 439 | issue = 7075| pages = 466–9 | bibcode = 2006Natur.439..466S | last2 = Seymour | last3 = O'Doherty | last4 = Stephan | last5 = Dolan | last6 = Frith | doi = 10.1038/nature04271 | pmid = 16421576 | pmc = 2636868 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An analysis from the journal of ''[[Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews]]''  also found that, overall, there are sex differences in empathy from birth, growing larger with age and which remains consistent and stable across lifespan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Females, on average, were found to have higher empathy than males, while children with higher empathy regardless of gender continue to be higher in empathy throughout development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empathy: Gender effects in brain and behavior|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|journal = Neuroscience &amp; Biobehavioral Reviews|pages = 604–627|volume = 46|doi = 10.1016/j.neubiorev.2014.09.001|first = Leonardo|last = Christov-Moore|first2 = Elizabeth A.|last2 = Simpson|first3 = Gino|last3 = Coudé|first4 = Kristina|last4 = Grigaityte|first5 = Marco|last5 = Iacoboni|first6 = Pier Francesco|last6 = Ferrari|pmid = 25236781|pmc = 5110041|year = 2014|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170814055810/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265859585_Empathy_Gender_Effects_in_Brain_and_Behavior|archivedate = August 14, 2017|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis of brain tools such as event related potentials found that females who saw human suffering tended to have higher ERP waveforms than males.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Another investigation with similar brain tools such as [[N400 (neuroscience)|N400]] amplitudes found, on average, higher N400 in females in response to social situations which positively correlated with self-reported empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Structural fMRI studies also found females to have larger [[grey matter]] volumes in posterior [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal]] and anterior [[Inferior parietal lobule|inferior parietal cortex]]  areas which are correlated with [[mirror neuron]]s in [[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] literature.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Females also tended to have a stronger link between emotional and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The researchers found that the stability of these sex differences in development are unlikely to be explained by any environment influences but rather might have some roots in human evolution and inheritance.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

Throughout prehistory, females were the primary nurturers and caretakers of children; so this might have led to an evolved neurological adaptation for women to be more aware and responsive to non-verbal expressions. According to the ''Primary Caretaker Hypothesis'', prehistoric males did not have the same selective pressure as primary caretakers; so therefore this might explain modern day sex differences in emotion recognition and empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== Empathy in educational contexts ===
Another growing focus of investigation is how empathy manifests in education between teachers and learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = McAlinden | first = Maggie | contribution = Can teachers know learners' minds?

This theory also states that empathy is learnable. However, research also shows that it is more difficult to empathize when there are differences between people including status, culture, religion, language, skin colour, gender, age and so on.&lt;ref name="Tettegah, S. 2007"/&gt;

An important target of the method [[Learning by teaching]] (LbT) is to train systematically and, in each lesson, teach empathy. Students have to transmit new content to their classmates, so they have to reflect continuously on the mental processes of the other students in the classroom. This way it is possible to develop step-by-step the students' feeling for group reactions and networking. Carl R. Rogers pioneered research in effective psychotherapy and teaching which espoused that empathy coupled with unconditional positive regard or caring for students and authenticity or congruence were the most important traits for a therapist or teacher to have. Other research and publications by Tausch, Aspy, Roebuck. Lyon, and meta-analyses by Cornelius-White, corroborated the importance of these person-centered traits.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius-White, J. H. D., and A. P. Harbaugh. (2010).

=== Empathy in intercultural contexts ===
In order to achieve intercultural empathy, psychologists have employed empathy training. One study hypothesized that empathy training would increase the measured level of relational empathy among the individuals in the experimental group when compared to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Keillor|first=Robin Michelle|date=1999|title=Empathy and intergroup relations: a study in cross-cultural relationship building|publisher=[[Arizona State University]]|oclc=44999879}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also hypothesized that empathy training would increase communication among the experimental group, and that perceived satisfaction with group dialogue would also increase among the experimental group. To test this, the experimenters used the Hogan Empathy Scale, the Barrett-Lennard Relationship Inventory, and questionnaires.  Using these measures, the study found that empathy training was not successful in increasing relational empathy. Also, communication and satisfaction among groups did not increase as a result of the empathy training. While there didn’t seem to be a clear relationship between empathy and relational empathy training, the study did report that "relational empathy training appeared to foster greater expectations for a deep dialogic process resulting in treatment differences in perceived depth of communication".

US researchers William Weeks, Paul Pedersen et al. state that developing intercultural empathy enables the interpretation of experiences or perspectives from more than one worldview.&lt;ref&gt;William Weeks, Paul Pedersen, &amp; Richard Brislin (1979).

University of Portland.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Developmental and environmental influences ===

The environment has been another interesting topic of study. Many theorize that environmental factors, such as parenting style and relationships, play a significant role in the development of empathy in children. Empathy promotes pro social relationships, helps mediate aggression, and allows us to relate to others, all of which make empathy an important emotion among children.

A study done by Caroline Tisot  looked at how a variety of environmental factors affected the development of empathy in young children. Parenting style, parent empathy, and prior social experiences were looked at. The children participating in the study were asked to complete an effective empathy measure, while the children's parents completed the Parenting Practices Questionnaire, which assesses parenting style, and the Balanced Emotional Empathy scale.

This study found that a few parenting practices – as opposed to parenting style as a whole – contributed to the development of empathy in children. These practices include encouraging the child to imagine the perspectives of others and teaching the child to reflect on his or her own feelings. The results also show that the development of empathy varied based on the gender of the child and parent. Paternal warmth was found to be significantly important, and was positively related to empathy within children, especially in boys. However, maternal warmth was negatively related to empathy within children, especially in girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Tisot|first=Caroline Monforte|date=2003|title=Environmental contributions to empathy development in young children|publisher=[[Temple University]]|oclc=56772472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been found that empathy can be disrupted due to trauma in the brain such as a stroke. In most cases empathy is usually impaired if a lesion or stroke occurs on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leigh|first=Richard|last2=Oishi|first2=Kenichi|last3=Hsu|first3=John|last4=Lindquist|first4=Martin|last5=Gottesman|first5=Rebecca F.|last6=Jarso|first6=Samson|last7=Crainiceanu|first7=Ciprian|last8=Mori|first8=Susumu|last9=Hillis|first9=Argye E.|date=2013-08-01|title=Acute lesions that impair affective empathy|url=http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|journal=Brain|language=en|volume=136|issue=8|pages=2539–2549|doi=10.1093/brain/awt177|issn=0006-8950|pmc=3722353|pmid=23824490|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161129031206/http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/136/8/2539|archivedate=November 29, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this it has been found that damage to the frontal lobe, which is primarily responsible for emotional regulation, can impact profoundly on a person's capacity to experience empathy toward another individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sousa|first=Arielle de|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|date=2012-07-01|title=Changes in emotional empathy, affective responsivity, and behavior following severe traumatic brain injury|journal=Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology|volume=34|issue=6|pages=606–623|doi=10.1080/13803395.2012.667067|issn=1380-3395|pmid=22435955}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who have suffered from an acquired brain injury also show lower levels of empathy according to previous studies. In fact, more than 50% of people who suffer from a traumatic brain injury self-report a deficit in their empathic capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Sousa|first=Arielle|last2=McDonald|first2=Skye|last3=Rushby|first3=Jacqueline|last4=Li|first4=Sophie|last5=Dimoska|first5=Aneta|last6=James|first6=Charlotte|date=2010-10-01|title=Why don't you feel how I feel?

This is again suggestive of the fact that understanding one's own emotions is key in being able to identify with another individual’s emotional state.

== Applications ==

The empathy-altruism relationship also has broad  for whom empathy is felt at the expense of other potential pro-social goals, thus inducing a type of bias. Researchers suggest that individuals are willing to act against the greater collective good or to violate their own moral principles of fairness and justice if doing so will benefit a person for whom empathy is felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Batson C. D. |author2=Moran T. | year = 1999 | title = Empathy-induced altruism in a prisoner's dilemma | url = | journal = Eur. J. Soc.

On a more positive note, aroused individuals in an empathetic manner may focus on the long-term welfare rather than just the short-term of those in need. Empathy-based socialization is very different from current practices directed toward inhibition of egoistic impulses through shaping, modeling and internalized guilt. Therapeutic programs built around facilitating altruistic impulses by encouraging perspective taking and empathetic feelings might enable individuals to develop more satisfactory interpersonal relations, especially in the long-term. At a societal level, experiments have indicated that empathy-induced altruism can be used to improve attitudes toward stigmatized groups, even used to improve racial attitudes, actions toward people with AIDS, the homeless and even convicts. Such resulting altruism has also been found to increase cooperation in competitive situations.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, C.R. and Lopez, S.J. (Eds.). (2009). Oxford Handbook of Positive Psychology. Second ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 243–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Individual differences ==

Empathy in the broadest sense refers to a reaction of one individual to another's emotional state. Recent years have seen increased movement toward the idea that empathy occurs from motor neuron imitation. But, how do we account for individual differences in empathy? It cannot be said that empathy is a single unipolar construct but rather a set of constructs. In essence, not every individual responds equally and uniformly the same to various circumstances. The Empathic Concern scale assesses "other-oriented" feelings of sympathy and concern and the Personal Distress scale measures "self-oriented" feelings of personal anxiety and unease. The combination of these scales helps reveal those that might not be classified as empathetic and expands the narrow definition of empathy. Using this approach we can enlarge the basis of what it means to possess empathetic qualities and create a multi-faceted definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davis | first1 = Mark H | year = 1983 | title = Measuring Individual Differences in Empathy: Evidence for a Multidimensional Approach | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–26 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behavioral and neuroimaging research show that two underlying facets of the personality dimensions Extraversion and Agreeableness (the Warmth-Altruistic personality profile) are associated with empathic accuracy and increased brain activity in two brain regions important for empathic processing (medial prefrontal cortex and temporoparietal junction).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haas|first1=BW|last2=Brook|first2=M|last3=Remillard|first3=L|last4=Ishak|first4=A|last5=Anderson|first5=IW|last6=Filkowski|first6=MM|title=I know how you feel: the warm-altruistic personality profile and the empathic brain.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=2015|volume=10|issue=3|pages=e0120639|pmid=25769028|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0120639|pmc=4359130|bibcode=2015PLoSO..1020639H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Empathic anger and distress ==

=== Anger ===

Empathic anger is an [[emotion]], a form of empathic distress.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/w126637624m00103/ |title= Empathy and justice motivation|doi=10.1007/BF00991641 |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |year=1990|last1=Hoffman|first1=Martin L.|journal=Motivation and Emotion|volume=14|issue=2|pages=151–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empathic anger is felt in a situation where someone else is being hurt by another person or thing. It is possible to see this form of anger as a [[pro-social]] emotion.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Empathic anger has direct effects on both helping and punishing desires. Empathic anger can be divided into two sub-categories: trait empathic anger and state empathic anger.&lt;ref&gt;Abstract: Assessing a new dimension of empathy: Empathic anger as a predictor of helping and punishing desires, Vitaglione, Guy D. &amp; Barnett, Mark A. {{cite web |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-12-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514194128/http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=15290642 |archivedate=May 14, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between empathy and anger response towards another person has also been investigated, with two studies basically finding that the higher a person's perspective taking ability, the less angry they were in response to a provocation. Empathic concern did not, however, significantly predict anger response, and higher personal distress was associated with increased anger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mohr P. |author2=Howells K. |author3=Gerace A. |author4=Day A. |author5=Wharton M. | year = 2007 | title = The role of perspective taking in anger arousal | url = | journal = Personality and Individual Differences | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 507–517 | doi = 10.1016/j.paid.2006.12.019 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Day A. |author2=Mohr P. |author3=Howells K. |author4=Gerace A. |author5=Lim L. | year = 2012 | title = The role of empathy in anger arousal in violent offenders and university students | url = | journal = International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology | volume = 56 | issue = 4|pages = 599–613 | doi = 10.1177/0306624X11431061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distress ===

Empathic distress is feeling the perceived pain of another person. This feeling can be transformed into empathic anger, feelings of injustice, or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]. These emotions can be perceived as pro-social, and some say they can be seen as motives for moral behavior.&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"/&gt;

== Impairment in psychopathology ==

A difference in distribution between affective and cognitive empathy has been observed in various conditions. [[Psychopathy]] and [[narcissism]] have been associated with impairments in affective but not cognitive empathy, whereas [[bipolar disorder]] and [[borderline personality disorder|borderline traits]] have been associated with deficits in cognitive but not affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; [[Autism spectrum disorder]]s have been associated with various combinations, including deficits in cognitive empathy as well as deficits in both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell" /&gt;&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; [[Schizophrenia]], too, has been associated with deficits in both types of empathy.&lt;ref name="10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.psychres.2007.05.017 |title=Empathic abilities in people with schizophrenia. |year=2008 |last1=Bora |first1=E. |last2=Gökçen |first2=S. |last3=Veznedaroglu |first3=B. |pmid=18514324 |volume=160 |issue=1 |journal=Psychiatry Res |pages=23–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even in people without conditions such as these, the balance between affective and cognitive empathy varies.&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt;

Atypical empathic responses have been associated with [[autism spectrum|autism]] and particular [[personality disorders]] such as [[psychopathy]], [[borderline personality disorder|borderline]],  [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]], and [[schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] personality disorders; [[conduct disorder]];&lt;ref name="Decety_BiologicalPsy2008" /&gt; [[schizophrenia]]; [[bipolar disorder]];&lt;ref name="Cox" /&gt; and [[depersonalization]].&lt;ref name="Grossman 1996"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Grossman |first=Dave |title=On Killing: The Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society |publisher=Back Bay Books |year=1996 |isbn=0-316-33000-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of affective empathy has also been associated with sex offenders. It was found that offenders that had been raised in an environment where they were shown a lack of empathy and had endured the same type of abuse, felt less affective empathy for their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simons|first=Dominique|last2=Wurtele|first2=Sandy K.|last3=Heil|first3=Peggy|date=2002-12-01|title=Childhood Victimization and Lack of Empathy as Predictors of Sexual Offending Against Women and Children|url=http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/17/12/1291|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|language=en|volume=17|issue=12|pages=1291–1307|doi=10.1177/088626002237857|issn=0886-2605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autism ===

The interaction between empathy and [[autism spectrum|autism]] is a complex and ongoing field of research. Several different factors are proposed to be at play.

A study of [[high-functioning autism|high-functioning]] adults with autistic spectrum disorders found an increased prevalence of [[alexithymia]],&lt;ref name="Hill et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hill E. |author2=Berthoz S. |author3=Frith U |year=2004 |title=Brief report: cognitive processing of own emotions in individuals with autistic spectrum disorder and in their relatives. |url=http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=229–235 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022613.41399.14 |pmid=15162941 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619122446/http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/2585/1/hill_berth_frith_jadd04.pdf |archivedate=June 19, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a personality construct characterized by the inability to recognize and articulate emotional arousal in oneself or others.&lt;ref name="Hill et al." /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, G.J. and Bagby, R.M &amp; Parker, J.D.A.

Recently, a study has shown that high-functioning autistic adults appear to have a range of responses to music similar to that of neurotypical individuals, including the deliberate use of music for mood management.

One study found that, relative to typically developing children, high-functioning autistic children showed reduced [[mirror neuron]] activity in the brain's [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (pars opercularis) while imitating and observing emotional expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dapretto M. |author2=Davies M.S. |author3=Pfeifer J.H. |author4=Scott A.A. |author5=Sigman M. |author6=Bookheimer S.Y. |author7=Iacoboni M. | year = 2006 | title = Understanding emotions in others: mirror neuron dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorders | url = | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 28–31 | doi=10.1038/nn1611 | pmid=16327784 | pmc=3713227}}&lt;/ref&gt; EEG evidence revealed that there was significantly greater mu suppression in the sensorimotor cortex of autistic individuals. Activity in this area was inversely related to symptom severity in the social domain, suggesting that a dysfunctional mirror neuron system may underlie social and communication deficits observed in autism, including impaired theory of mind and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Oberman. – 'EEG evidence for mirror neuron dysfunction in autism spectrum' in Brain Research (2005) p.190&lt;/ref&gt; The mirror neuron system is essential for emotional empathy.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;

Previous studies have suggested that autistic individuals have an impaired [[theory of mind]]. Theory of mind is the ability to understand the perspectives of others.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The terms cognitive empathy and [[theory of mind]] are often used synonymously, but due to a lack of studies comparing theory of mind with types of empathy, it is unclear whether these are equivalent.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; Theory of mind relies on structures of the temporal lobe and the pre-frontal cortex, and empathy, i.e. the ability to share the feelings of others, relies on the sensorimotor cortices as well as limbic and para-limbic structures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} The lack of clear distinctions between [[theory of mind]] and cognitive empathy may have resulted in an incomplete understanding of the empathic abilities of those with Asperger syndrome; many reports on the empathic deficits of individuals with Asperger syndrome are actually based on impairments in theory of mind.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gillberg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillberg | first1 = C.

Studies have found that individuals on the autistic spectrum self-report lower levels of empathic concern, show less or absent comforting responses toward someone who is suffering, and report equal or higher levels of personal distress compared to controls.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The combination in those on the autism spectrum of reduced empathic concern and increased personal distress may lead to the overall reduction of empathy.&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; Professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] suggests that those with classic [[autism]] often lack both cognitive and affective empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees" /&gt; However, other research has found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hamilton AF | title = Goals, intentions and mental states: challenges for theories of autism | journal = J Child Psychol Psychiatry | volume = 50 | issue = 8 | pages = 881–92 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19508497 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-7610.2009.02098.x | citeseerx = 10.1.1.621.6275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research also suggests that people with [[Asperger syndrome]] may have problems understanding others' perspectives in terms of theory of mind, but the average person with the condition demonstrates equal empathic concern as, and higher personal distress, than controls.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt; The existence of individuals with heightened personal distress on the autism spectrum has been offered as an explanation as to why at least some people with autism would appear to have heightened emotional empathy,&lt;ref name="response" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;Phoebe Caldwell, "Letters", London Times, Dec 30 2005&lt;/ref&gt; although increased personal distress may be an effect of heightened egocentrism, emotional empathy depends on [[mirror neuron]] activity (which, as described previously, has been found to be reduced in those with autism), and empathy in people on the autism spectrum is generally reduced.&lt;ref name="Shamay-Tsoory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="response" /&gt; The empathy deficits present in autism spectrum disorders may be more indicative of impairments in the ability to take the perspective of others, while the empathy deficits in psychopathy may be more indicative of impairments in responsiveness to others’ emotions. These “disorders of empathy” further highlight the importance of the ability to empathize by illustrating some of the consequences to disrupted empathy development.&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Nicole M., and Daniel S. Messinger. "The development of empathy: How, when, and why." ''Moral Behavior and Free Will: A Neurobiological and Philosophical Aprroach'' (2011): 341-368.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[empathizing–systemizing theory]] (E-S) suggests that people may be classified on the basis of their capabilities along two independent dimensions, empathizing (E) and systemizing (S). These capabilities may be inferred through tests that measure someone's Empathy Quotient (EQ) and Systemizing Quotient (SQ). Five different "brain types" can be observed among the population based on the scores, which should correlate with differences at the neural level. In the E-S theory, autism and Asperger syndrome are associated with below-average empathy and average or above-average systemizing. The E-S theory has been extended into the Extreme Male Brain theory, which suggests that people with an autism spectrum condition are more likely to have an "Extreme Type S" brain type, corresponding with above-average systemizing but challenged empathy.&lt;ref name="e-s theory"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Baron-Cohen | first = Simon |year=2009 |title=Autism: The Empathizing–Systemizing (E-S) Theory |journal=[[Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences]] |volume=1156 |issue=The Year in Cognitive Neuroscience 2009 |pages=68&amp;ndash;80 |doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04467.x |bibcode = 2009NYASA1156...68B |pmid=19338503 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Extreme Male Brain (EMB) theory proposes that individuals on the autistic spectrum are characterized by impairments in empathy due to sex differences in the brain: specifically, people with autism spectrum conditions show an exaggerated male profile. A study showed that some aspects of autistic neuroanatomy seem to be extremes of typical male neuroanatomy, which may be influenced by elevated levels of [[Prenatal testosterone transfer|fetal testosterone]] rather than gender itself.&lt;ref name="e-s theory" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fetal testosterone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Auyeung | first1 = Bonnie | last2 = Baron-Cohen | first2 = Simon | last3 = Ashwin | first3 = Emma | last4 = Knickmeyer | first4 = Rebecca | last5 = Taylor | first5 = Kevin | last6 = Hackett | first6 = Gerald | title = Fetal testosterone and autistic traits | journal = [[British Psychological Society#Journal|British Journal of Psychology]] | volume = 100 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;22 | doi = 10.1348/000712608X311731 | pmid = 18547459 | date = February 2009 | ref = harv | url = https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/files/16383524/Fetal_testosterone_and_autistic_traits.pdf }} [http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_Auyeung_etal_BJP.pdf Pdf.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809053353/http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2009_Auyeung_etal_BJP.pdf |date=August 9, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.psypost.org/2016/03/testosterone-may-reduce-empathy-blocking-brain-connections-41985|title=Testosterone may reduce empathy by reducing brain connectivity|website=PsyPost|access-date=2016-04-03|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402081237/http://www.psypost.org/2016/03/testosterone-may-reduce-empathy-blocking-brain-connections-41985|archivedate=April 2, 2016|df=mdy-all|date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study involving brain scans of 120 men and women suggested that autism affects male and female brains differently; females with autism had brains that appeared to be closer to those of non-autistic males than females, yet the same kind of difference was not observed in males with autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Autism 'affects male and female brains differently' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23613816 |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=August 9, 2013 |accessdate=August 9, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809170217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-23613816 |archivedate=August 9, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the discovery of a higher incidence of diagnosed autism in some groups of second generation immigrant children was initially explained as a result of too little vitamin D during pregnancy in dark-skinned people further removed from the equator, that explanation did not hold up for the later discovery that diagnosed autism was most frequent in children of newly immigrated parents and decreased if they immigrated many years earlier as that would further deplete the body's store of vitamin D. Nor could it explain the similar effect on diagnosed autism for some European migrants America in the 1940s that was reviewed in the 2010s as a shortage of vitamin D was never a problem for these light-skinned immigrants to America. The decrease of diagnosed autism with the number of years the parents had lived in their new country also cannot be explained by the theory that the cause is genetic no matter if it is said to be caused by actual ethnic differences in autism gene prevalence or a selective migration of individuals predisposed for autism since such genes, if present, would not go away over time. It have therefore been suggested that autism is not caused by an innate deficit in a specific social circuitry in the brain, also citing other research suggesting that specificalized social brain mechanisms may not exist even in neurotypic people, but that particular features of appearance and/or minor details in behavior are met with exclusion from socialization that shows up as apparently reduced social ability.&lt;ref&gt;"Immigrant Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder: The Relationship between the Perspective of the Professionals and the Parents’ Point of View" 2013 Milena Pereira Pondé PhD, Cécile Rousseau&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Prevalence of autism according to maternal immigrant status and ethnic origin" 2011 Marie-Jose Dealberto&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathy ===

Psychopathy is a personality disorder partly characterized by antisocial and aggressive behaviors, as well as emotional and interpersonal deficits including shallow emotions and a lack of [[remorse]] and empathy.&lt;ref name="Cleckly, 1941"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cleckly|first=H.

A large body of research suggests that psychopathy is associated with atypical responses to distress cues (e.g. facial and vocal expressions of fear and [[sadness]]), including decreased activation of the [[Fusiform gyrus|fusiform]] and [[Extrastriate cortex|extrastriate cortical]] regions, which may partly account for impaired recognition of and reduced autonomic responsiveness to expressions of fear, and impairments of empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Decety, J., &amp; Skelly, L.

A recent study on psychopaths found that, under certain circumstances, they could willfully empathize with others, and that their empathic reaction initiated the same way it does for controls. Psychopathic criminals were brain-scanned while watching videos of a person harming another individual. The psychopaths' empathic reaction initiated the same way it did for controls when they were instructed to empathize with the harmed individual, and the area of the brain relating to pain was activated when the psychopaths were asked to imagine how the harmed individual felt. The research suggests how psychopaths could switch empathy on at will, which would enable them to be both callous and charming. The team who conducted the study say it is still unknown how to transform this willful empathy into the spontaneous empathy most people have, though they propose it could be possible to bring psychopaths closer to rehabilitation by helping them to activate their "empathy switch". Others suggested that despite the results of the study, it remained unclear whether psychopaths' experience of empathy was the same as that of controls, and also questioned the possibility of devising therapeutic interventions that would make the empathic reactions more automatic.&lt;ref name="empathy switch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Psychopathic criminals have empathy switch |first=Melissa |last=Hogenboom |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |newspaper=BBC News |date=July 25, 2013 |accessdate=July 28, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727080108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23431793 |archivedate=July 27, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Tanya.

Work conducted by Professor [[Jean Decety]] with large samples of incarcerated psychopaths offers additional insights. In one study, psychopaths were scanned while viewing video clips depicting people being intentionally hurt. They were also tested on their responses to seeing short videos of facial expressions of pain. The participants in the high-psychopathy group exhibited significantly less activation in the [[ventromedial prefrontal cortex]], [[amygdala]] and [[periaqueductal gray]] parts of the brain, but more activity in the [[striatum]] and the [[insular cortex|insula]] when compared to control participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Decety | first1 = J. | last2 = Skelly | first2 = L.

It was predicted that people who have high levels of psychopathy would have sufficient levels of cognitive empathy but would lack in their ability to use affective empathy. People that scored highly on psychopathy measures were less likely to portray affective empathy. There was a strong negative correlation showing that psychopathy and affective empathy correspond strongly. The DANVA-2 portrayed those who scored highly on the psychopathy scale do not lack in recognising emotion in facial expressions. Therefore, individuals who have high scores on psychopathy and do not lack in perspective-talking ability but do lack in compassion and the negative incidents that happen to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullins-Nelson | first1 = Jana L. | last2 = Salekin | first2 = Randall T. | last3 = Anne-Marie | first3 = R.

Despite studies suggesting deficits in emotion perception and imagining others in pain, professor [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] claims psychopathy is associated with intact cognitive empathy, which would imply an intact ability to read and respond to behaviors, social cues and what others are feeling. Psychopathy is, however, associated with impairment in the other major component of empathy—affective (emotional) empathy—which includes the ability to ''feel'' the suffering and emotions of others (what scientists would term as [[emotional contagion]]), and those with the condition are therefore not distressed by the suffering of their victims. Such a dissociation of affective and cognitive empathy has indeed been demonstrated for aggressive offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winter|first=Korina|last2=Spengler|first2=Stephanie|last3=Bermpohl|first3=Felix|last4=Singer|first4=Tania|last5=Kanske|first5=Philipp|date=2017-04-06|title=Social cognition in aggressive offenders: Impaired empathy, but intact theory of mind|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-00745-0|journal=Scientific Reports|language=En|volume=7|issue=1|doi=10.1038/s41598-017-00745-0|issn=2045-2322|bibcode=2017NatSR...7..670W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those with [[Autism spectrum disorder|autism]], on the other hand, are claimed to be often impaired in both affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="zero degrees"&gt;{{cite book |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Zero Degrees of Empathy: A New Theory of Human Cruelty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5QUPgbxY4C4C |accessdate=August 8, 2013 |year=2011 |publisher=Penguin UK |location= |isbn= 9780713997910|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One problem with the theory that the ability to turn empathy on and off constitutes psychopathy is that such a theory would classify socially sanctioned violence and [[punishment]] as psychopathy, as it means suspending empathy towards certain individuals and/or groups. The attempt to get around this by standardizing tests of psychopathy for cultures with different norms of punishment is criticized in this context for being based on the assumption that people can be classified in discrete cultures while cultural influences are in reality mixed and every person encounters a mosaic of influences (e.g. non-shared environment having more influence than family environment). It is suggested that psychopathy may be an artefact of psychiatry's standardization along imaginary sharp lines between cultures, as opposed to an actual difference in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;“How Emotions are Made: The Secret Life of the Brain” 2017 Lisa Feldman Barrett&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Role of Culture in Empathy: The Consequences and Explanations of Cultural Differences in Empathy at the Affective and Cognitive Levels" 2014 David Atkins&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other conditions ===

Research indicates atypical empathic responses are also correlated with a variety of other conditions.

[[Borderline personality disorder]] is characterized by extensive behavioral and interpersonal difficulties that arise from emotional and cognitive dysfunction.&lt;ref name="Minzenberg et al., 2006)"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Minzenberg|first=M.J.|first2=M.|last2=Fisher-Irving|first3=J.H.|last3=Poole|first4=S.|last4=Vinogradov|year=2006|title=Reduced self-referential source memory performance is associated with interpersonal dysfunction in borderline personality disorder|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders|url=http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516001713/http://ucdirc.ucdavis.edu/people/papers/minzenberg_fisher_etal_JPD2006.pdf|archivedate=May 16, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dysfunctional social and interpersonal behavior has been shown to play a crucial role in the emotionally intense way people with borderline personality disorder react.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; While individuals with borderline personality disorder may show their emotions too much, several authors have suggested that they might have a compromised ability to reflect upon mental states (impaired [[cognitive empathy]]), as well as an impaired [[theory of mind]].&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; People with borderline personality disorder have been shown to be very good at recognizing emotions in people's faces, suggesting increased empathic capacities.&lt;ref name="Wagner and Linehan, 1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=A.W.|author2=M.M Linehan|year=1999|title=Facial expression recognition ability among women with borderline personality disorder: implications for emotion regulation?|journal=Journal of Personality Disorders}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lynch|first=T.R.|first2=M.Z. |last2=Rosenthal |first3=D.S. |last3=Kosson |first4=J.S. |last4=Cheavens |first5=C.W. |last5=Lejuez |first6=R.J. |last6=Blair|year=2006|title=Heightened sensitivity to facial expressions of emotion in borderline personality disorder.|journal=Emotion|doi=10.1037/1528-3542.6.4.647 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=647–655}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, therefore, possible that impaired cognitive empathy (the capacity for understanding another person's experience and perspective) may account for borderline personality disorder individuals' tendency for interpersonal dysfunction, while "hyper-emotional empathy"{{Verify source|date=August 2013}} may account for the emotional over-reactivity observed in these individuals.&lt;ref name=Harari/&gt; One primary study confirmed that patients with borderline personality disorder were significantly impaired in cognitive empathy, yet there was no sign of impairment in affective empathy.&lt;ref name=Harari&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harari|first=Hagai|author2=Simone G.

Proper empathic engagement helps an individual understand and anticipate the behavior of another. Apart from the automatic tendency to recognize the emotions of others, one may also deliberately engage in empathic reasoning. Two general methods have been identified here. An individual may simulate fictitious versions of the beliefs, desires, character traits and context of another individual to see what emotional feelings it provokes. Or, an individual may simulate an emotional feeling and then access the environment for a suitable reason for the emotional feeling to be appropriate for that specific environment.&lt;ref name="DeWaal"&gt;{{cite journal | author = de Waal F.

Some research suggests that people are more able and willing to empathize with those most similar to themselves. In particular, empathy increases with similarities in culture and living conditions. Empathy is more likely to occur between individuals whose interaction is more frequent. (See Levenson and Reuf 1997 and Hoffman 2000: 62). A measure of how well a person can infer the specific content of another person's thoughts and feelings has been developed by William Ickes (1997, 2003). [[Paul Bloom (psychologist)|Paul Bloom]] an anti-empathy crusader claims emotional engagement of empathy leads to racism and prejudice.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}} In 2010, team led by Grit Hein and Tania Singer gave two groups of men wristbands according to which football team they supported. Each participant received a mild electric shock, then watched another go through the same pain. When the wristbands matched, both brains flared: with pain, and empathic pain. If they supported opposing teams, the observer was found to have little empathy.&lt;ref name="HeinSilani2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hein|first1=Grit|last2=Silani|first2=Giorgia|last3=Preuschoff|first3=Kerstin|last4=Batson|first4=C.

He ascertains empathy as an exhaustive process that limits us in morality and if low empathy makes for bad people, bundled up in that unsavoury group would be many who have Asperger’s or autism and reveals his own brother is severely autistic.{{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}
Early indicators for a lack of empathy:
#Frequently finding oneself in prolonged arguments
#Forming opinions early and defending them vigorously
#Thinking that other people are overly sensitive
#Refusing to listen to other points of view
#Blaming others for mistakes
#Not listening when spoken to
#Holding grudges and having difficulty to forgive
#Inability to work in a team{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

There are concerns that the empathizer's own emotional background may affect or distort what emotions they perceive in others (e.g. Goleman 1996: p.&amp;nbsp;104). It is evidenced that societies that promote individualism have lower ability for empathy.&lt;ref name="WeinerCraighead2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Irving B. Weiner|author2=W.

It is a skill that is gradually developed throughout life, and which improves the more contact we have with the person with whom one empathizes.

== Ethical issues ==

The extent to which a person's emotions are publicly observable, or mutually recognized as such has significant social consequences. Empathic recognition may or may not be welcomed or socially desirable. This is particularly the case where we recognize the emotions that someone has towards us during real time interactions. Based on a metaphorical affinity with touch, philosopher Edith Wyschogrod claims that the proximity entailed by empathy increases the potential vulnerability of either party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Wyschogrod E | year = 1981 | title = Empathy and sympathy as tactile encounter | url = | journal = J Med Philos | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 25–43 | doi = 10.1093/jmp/6.1.25 | pmid = 7229562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appropriate role of empathy in our dealings with others is highly dependent on the circumstances. For instance, [[Tania Singer]] says that clinicians or caregivers must be objective to the emotions of others, to not over-invest their own emotions for the other, at the risk of [[compassion fatigue|draining away]] their own resourcefulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|title=Compassion over empathy could help prevent emotional burnout|work=Wired UK|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160515020421/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-07/12/tania-singer-compassion-burnout|archivedate=May 15, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an awareness of the limitations of empathic accuracy is prudent in a [[caregiving]] situation.

=== Philosophy ===

==== Ethics ====

In his 2008 book, ''[[How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time:Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong]]'', writer [[Iain King]] presents two reasons why empathy is the "essence" or "DNA" of right and wrong. First, he argues that empathy uniquely has all the characteristics we can know about an ethical viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;''How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time: Solving the Riddle of Right and Wrong'', (2008), {{ISBN|978-1-84706-347-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – including that it is "partly self-standing", and so provides a source of motivation that is partly within us and partly outside, as moral motivations seem to be.&lt;ref name="King2008-74"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;pg=PA74#v=onepage&amp;q=empathy%20iain%20king&amp;f=false|accessdate=August 28, 2013|publisher=Continuum|date=16 October 2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=74|quote=Empathy is special, because it always and automatically has the characteristics of right and wrong&amp;nbsp;... Something rooted in empathy must have more of the essence of good about it than something which is not.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows empathy-based judgements to have sufficient distance from a personal opinion to count as "moral". His second argument is more practical: he argues, "Empathy for others really is the route to value in life", and so the means by which a selfish attitude can become a moral one. By using empathy as the basis for a system of ethics, King is able to reconcile ethics based on [[Consequentialism|consequences]] with [[Virtue Ethics|virtue-ethics]] and [[Deontological ethics|act-based]] accounts of right and wrong.&lt;ref name="King2008-227"&gt;{{cite book|author=Iain King|title=How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6TAjY609aAC&amp;lpg=PA227|publisher=Continuum|location=London|date=2008|isbn=978-1-84706-347-2|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; His empathy-based system has been taken up by some [[Buddhism|Buddhists]],&lt;ref&gt;A Buddhist account of Iain King's ideas is set out in [http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics this] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020235032/http://www.experiencefestival.com/wp/article/iain-king-ethics |date=October 20, 2012 }} Global Oneness article.&lt;/ref&gt; and is used to address some practical problems, such as when to tell [[Lie#Ethics|lies]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Publishers Weekly]] state that "King is even able to formulate a credible rule that tells us when to lie" [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 here.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117030514/http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-84706-347-2 |date=November 17, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and how to develop culturally-neutral [[Romance (love)#In philosophy|rules for romance]].

In the 2007 book ''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', philosopher [[Michael Slote]] introduces a theory of care-based ethics that is grounded in empathy. His claim is that moral motivation does, and should, stem from a basis of empathic response. He claims that our natural reaction to situations of moral significance are explained by empathy. He explains that the limits and obligations of empathy and in turn morality are natural. These natural obligations include a greater empathic, and moral obligation to family and friends, along with an account of temporal and physical distance. In situations of close temporal and physical distance, and with family or friends, our moral obligation seems stronger to us than with strangers at a distance naturally. Slote explains that this is due to empathy and our natural empathic ties. He further adds that actions are wrong if and only if they reflect or exhibit a deficiency of fully developed empathic concern for others on the part of the agent.&lt;ref&gt;''The Ethics of Care and Empathy'', Michael Slote, Oxford University Press, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phenomenology ====

In [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], empathy describes the experience of something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and [[Other (philosophy)|other]]. This draws on the [[sense of agency]]. In the most basic sense, this is the experience of the other's body and, in this sense, it is an experience of "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the experience is modified so that what is experienced is experienced as being the other's experience; in experiencing empathy, what is experienced is not "my" experience, even though ''I'' experience it. Empathy is also considered to be the condition of [[intersubjectivity]] and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.&lt;ref&gt;''Empathy in the Context of Philosophy'', Lou Agosta, Palgrave/Macmillan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== History ===

Some postmodern historians such as [[Keith Jenkins]] in recent years have debated whether or not it is possible to empathize with people from the past. Jenkins argues that empathy only enjoys such a privileged position in the present because it corresponds harmoniously with the dominant [[Liberalism|liberal]] discourse of modern society and can be connected to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s concept of reciprocal freedom. Jenkins argues the past is a foreign country and as we do not have access to the [[epistemological]] conditions of by gone ages we are unable to empathize.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, K. (1991) ''Re-thinking History'' London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to forecast the effect of empathy on the future.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A past subject may take part in the present by the so-called historic present. If we watch from a fictitious past, can tell the present with the future tense, as it happens with the trick of the false prophecy. There is no way of telling the present with the means of the past.&lt;ref&gt;Pozzi, G. (1976) Prefazione 6. L'elemento storico e politico -sociale, in G.B. Marino, ''L'Adone'' Milano&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychotherapy ===

[[Heinz Kohut]] is the main introducer of the principle of empathy in psychoanalysis. His principle applies to the method of gathering unconscious material. The possibility of not applying the principle is granted in the cure, for instance when you must reckon with another principle, that of reality.

In evolutionary psychology, attempts at explaining pro-social behavior often mention the presence of empathy in the individual as a possible variable. While exact motives behind complex social behaviors are difficult to distinguish, the "ability to put oneself in the shoes of another person and experience events and emotions the way that person experienced them" is the definitive factor for truly altruistic behavior according to Batson's [[empathy-altruism]] hypothesis. If empathy is not felt, social exchange (what's in it for me?) supersedes pure altruism, but if empathy is felt, an individual will help by actions or by word, regardless of whether it is in their self-interest to do so and even if the costs outweigh potential rewards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Aronson | first = Elliot | authorlink = Elliot Aronson | last2 = Wilson |first2=Timothy D. |last3=Akert |first3=Robin | title = Social Psychology, 6th Edition | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]] | year = 2007 | isbn = 0-13-238245-8}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Business and management ===

In the 2009 book ''Wired to Care'', strategy consultant [[Dev Patnaik]] argues that a major flaw in contemporary business practice is a lack of empathy inside large corporations. He states that lacking any sense of empathy, people inside companies struggle to make intuitive decisions and often get fooled into believing they understand their business if they have quantitative research to rely upon. Patnaik claims that the real opportunity for companies doing business in the 21st century is to create a widely held sense of empathy for customers, pointing to [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Harley-Davidson]], and [[IBM]] as examples of "Open Empathy Organizations". Such institutions, he claims, see new opportunities more quickly than competitors, adapt to change more easily, and create workplaces that offer employees a greater sense of mission in their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiredtocare.com|title=Wired To Care|work=wiredtocare.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210095811/http://www.wiredtocare.com/|archivedate=December 10, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2011 book ''The Empathy Factor'', organizational consultant [[Marie Miyashiro]] similarly argues the value of bringing empathy to the workplace, and offers [[Nonviolent Communication]] as an effective mechanism for achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Empathy Factor: Your Competitive Advantage for Personal, Team, and Business Success

== Measurement ==
{{citation style|section|date=July 2013}}
Research into the measurement of empathy has sought to answer a number of questions: who should be carrying out the measurement? What should pass for empathy and what should be discounted? What unit of measure (UOM) should be adopted and to what degree should each occurrence precisely match that UOM are also key questions that researchers have sought to investigate.

Researchers have approached the measurement of empathy from a number of perspectives.

Behavioral measures normally involve raters assessing the presence or absence of certain either predetermined or ad-hoc behaviors in the subjects they are monitoring. Both verbal and non-verbal behaviors have been captured on video by experimenters such as Truax (1967b).&lt;ref&gt;Truax, C. B. (1967). Rating of Accurate Empathy. The Therapeutic Relationship and its Impact. A Study of Psychotherapy with Schizophrenics. Eds. C. R. Rogers, E. T. Gendlin, D. J. Kiesler and C. B. Truax. Madison, Wisconsin, The University of Wisconsin Press pp.&amp;nbsp;555–568.&lt;/ref&gt; Other experimenters, including Mehrabian and Epstein (1972),&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mehrabian A. |author2=Epstein N. | year = 1972 | title = A measure of emotional empathy | url = | journal = Journal of Personality | volume = 40 | issue = 4| pages = 525–543 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-6494.1972.tb00078.x | pmid = 4642390 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have required subjects to comment upon their own feelings and behaviors, or those of other people involved in the experiment, as indirect ways of signaling their level of empathic functioning to the raters.

Physiological responses tend to be captured by elaborate electronic equipment that has been physically connected to the subject's body. Researchers then draw inferences about that person's empathic reactions from the electronic readings produced (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Levenson R. W. |author2=Ruef A. M. | year = 1992 | title = Empathy: a physiological substrate | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 63 | issue = 2| pages = 234–246 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.63.2.234 | pmid = 1403614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leslie et al., 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Leslie K. R. |author2=Johnson-Frey S. H. | year = 2004 | title = Functional imaging of face and hand imitation: towards a motor theory of empathy | url = | journal = NeuroImage | volume = 21 | issue = 2| pages = 601–607 | doi = 10.1016/j.neuroimage.2003.09.038 | pmid = 14980562 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Bodily or "somatic" measures can be looked upon as behavioral measures at a micro level. Their focus is upon measuring empathy through facial and other non-verbally expressed reactions in the empathizer. These changes are presumably underpinned by physiological changes brought about by some form of "emotional contagion" or mirroring (e.g. Levenson and Ruef, 1992*; Leslie et al., 2004*). It should be pointed out that these reactions, whilst appearing to reflect the internal emotional state of the empathizer, could also, if the stimulus incident lasted more than the briefest period, be reflecting the results of emotional reactions that are based upon more pieces of thinking through (cognitions) associated with role-taking ("if I were him I would feel&amp;nbsp;...").

Paper-based indices involve one or more of a variety of methods of responding. In some experiments, subjects are required to watch video scenarios (either staged or authentic) and to make written responses which are then assessed for their levels of empathy (e.g. Geher, Warner and Brown, 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Geher G. |author2=Warner R. M. | year = 2001 | title = Predictive validity of the emotional accuracy research scale | url = | journal = Intelligence | volume = 29 | issue = 5| pages = 373–388 | doi = 10.1016/S0160-2896(00)00045-3 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;); scenarios are sometimes also depicted in printed form (e.g. Mehrabian and Epstein, 1972&lt;ref name="Mehrabian A., Epstein N. 1972 525–543"/&gt;). Measures also frequently require subjects to self-report upon their own ability or capacity for empathy, using Likert-style numerical responses to a printed questionnaire that may have been designed to tap into the affective, cognitive-affective or largely cognitive substrates of empathic functioning. Some questionnaires claim to have been able to tap into both cognitive and affective substrates (e.g. Davis, 1980&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M. H. | year = 1980 | title = A multidimensional approach to individual differences in empathy | url = | journal = JSAS Catalogue of selected documents in psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). More recent paper-based tools include The [[Empathy Quotient]] (EQ) created by [[Simon Baron-Cohen|Baron-Cohen]] and Wheelwright&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Baron-Cohen S. |author2=Wheelwright S. |year=2004 |title=The empathy quotient: an investigation of adults with Asperger Syndrome or high functioning autism, and normal sex differences |url=http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |journal=Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=163–175 |doi=10.1023/B:JADD.0000022607.19833.00 |pmid=15162935 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304035846/http://www.queensu.ca/rarc/services/ASDAssessmentTemplate/ResourcesfromRobertGauthierfromRARCworkshop2014/EQArticle.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which comprises a self-report questionnaire consisting of 60 items.

For the very young, picture or puppet-story indices for empathy have been adopted to enable even very young, pre-school subjects to respond without needing to read questions and write answers (e.g. Denham and Couchoud, 1990). Dependent variables (variables that are monitored for any change by the experimenter) for younger subjects have included self reporting on a 7-point smiley face scale and filmed facial reactions (Barnett, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barnett M. A. | year = 1984 | title = Similarity of experience and empathy in preschoolers | url = | journal = Journal of Genetic Psychology | volume = 145 | issue = 2| pages = 241–250 | doi = 10.1080/00221325.1984.10532271 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A certain amount of confusion exists about how to measure empathy. These may be rooted in another problem: deciding what empathy is and what it is not. In general, researchers have until now been keen to pin down a singular definition of empathy which would allow them to design a measure to assess its presence in an exchange, in someone's repertoire of behaviors or within them as a latent trait. As a result, they have been frequently forced to ignore the richness of the empathic process in favor of capturing surface, explicit self-report or third-party data about whether empathy between two people was present or not. In most cases, instruments have unfortunately only yielded information on whether someone had the potential to demonstrate empathy (Geher et al., 2001)*. Gladstein (1987)&lt;ref&gt;Gladstein, G. A. (1987). What It All Means. Empathy and counseling: explorations in theory and research. G. A. Gladstein. New York, Springer-Verlag: 173–189.&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes the position noting that empathy has been measured from the point of view of the empathizer, the recipient for empathy and the third-party observer. He suggests that since the multiple measures used have produced results that bear little relation to one another, researchers should refrain from making comparisons between scales that are in fact measuring different things. He suggests that researchers should instead stipulate what kind of empathy they are setting out to measure rather than simplistically stating that they are setting out to measure the unitary phenomenon "empathy"; a view more recently endorsed by Duan and Hill (1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Duan C. |author2=Hill C. E. | year = 1996 | title = The current state of empathy research | url = | journal = Journal of Counselling Psychology | volume = 43 | issue = 3| pages = 261–274 | doi = 10.1037/0022-0167.43.3.261 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the field of medicine, a measurement tool for carers is the ''Jefferson Scale of Physician Empathy, Health Professional Version (JSPE-HP)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen D, Lew R, Hershman W, Orlander J |year= 2007 |title= A cross-sectional measurement of medical student empathy |journal= J Gen Intern Med |volume= 22 |issue= 10 |pages= 1434–8 |publisher= |doi= 10.1007/s11606-007-0298-x |pmc= 2305857 |pmid= 17653807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) is the only published measurement tool to date that accounts for a multi-dimensional assessment of empathy. It comprises a self-report questionnaire of 28 items, divided into four 7-item scales covering the above subdivisions of affective and cognitive empathy.&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Davis M | year = 1983 | title = Measuring individual differences in empathy: evidence for a multidimensional approach | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 113–126 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.44.1.113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rogers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis1983" /&gt;

== Other animals ==

Research has shown that the ability of empathy in other species is attainable. Many instances of empathy have been recorded throughout many species, including (but not limited to) canines, felines, dolphins, primates, rats and mice {{citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In animals, empathy-related responding could have an ulterior motive such as survival, the sharing of food, companionship and pack-oriented mentality. It is certainly difficult to understand an animal's intention behind an empathic response. Many researchers{{Who|weasel|date=May 2014}} maintain that applying the term empathy in general to animal behavior is an act of [[anthropomorphism]].

Researchers Zanna Clay and [[Frans de Waal]] studied the socio-emotional development of the [[bonobo]] chimpanzee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clay|author2=Zanna|title=Development of socio-emotional competence in bonobos.|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=November 5, 2014|volume=110|issue=45|pages=18121–18126|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=181339d9-1520-40c7-a9e4-ce8ac385d6d9%40sessionmgr115&amp;hid=120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-39226-002|doi=10.1073/pnas.1316449110|bibcode = 2013PNAS..11018121C |pmc=3831480}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on the interplay of numerous skills such as empathy-related responding, and how different rearing backgrounds of the juvenile bonobo affected their response to stressful events, related to themselves (loss of a fight) and of stressful events of others. It was found that the bonobos  sought out body contact as a coping mechanism with one another. A finding of this study was that the bonobos sought out more body contact after watching a distressing event upon the other bonobos rather than their individually experienced stressful event. Mother-reared bonobos as opposed to orphaned bonobos sought out more physical contact after a stressful event happened to another. This finding shows the importance of mother-child attachment and bonding, and how it may be crucial to successful socio-emotional development, such as empathic-like behaviors.

Empathic-like responding has been observed in [[chimpanzees]] in various different aspects of their natural behaviors. For example, chimpanzees are known to spontaneously contribute comforting behaviors to victims of aggressive behavior in natural and unnatural settings, a behavior recognized as consolation. Researchers Teresa Romero and co-workers observed these empathic and sympathetic-like behaviors in chimpanzees at two separate outdoor housed groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Romero|author2=Teresa|title=Consolation as possible expression of sympathetic concern among chimpanzees|journal=US: National Academy of Sciences.|date=July 6, 2010|volume=107|issue=27|pages=12110–12115|doi=10.1073/pnas.1006991107|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=11&amp;sid=24706b87-cfc3-4942-8f8f-8d4fa8b29f28%40sessionmgr198&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2010-14411-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10712110R |pmc=2901437}}&lt;/ref&gt; The act of consolation was observed in both of the groups of chimpanzees. This behavior is found in humans, and particularly in human infants. Another similarity found between chimpanzees and humans is that empathic-like responding was disproportionately provided to individuals of kin. Although comforting towards non-family chimpanzees was also observed, as with humans, chimpanzees showed the majority of comfort and concern to close/loved ones. Another similarity between chimpanzee and human expression of empathy is that females provided more comfort than males on average. The only exception to this discovery was that high-ranking males showed as much empathy-like behavior as their female counterparts. This is believed to be because of policing-like behavior and the authoritative status of high-ranking male chimpanzees.

It is thought that species that possess a more intricate and developed prefrontal cortex have more of an ability of experiencing empathy. It has however been found that empathic and altruistic responses may also be found in sand dwelling Mediterranean ants. Researcher Hollis studied the ''[[Cataglyphis cursor]]'' sand dwelling Mediterranean ant and their rescue behaviors by ensnaring ants from a nest in nylon threads and partially buried beneath the sand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hollis|first=Karen|title=A comparative analysis of precision rescue behaviour in sand-dwelling ants|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=March 2013|volume=85|series=Animal Behaviour|issue=3|pages=537–544|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2012.12.005|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com.glacier.sou.edu/ehost/detail?vid=5&amp;sid=bf4000d0-6a9c-4225-8ebf-82db56f427e8%40sessionmgr113&amp;hid=128&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-01472-001|accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ants not ensnared in the nylon thread proceeded to attempt to rescue their nest mates by sand digging, limb pulling, transporting sand away from the trapped ant, and when efforts remained unfruitful, began to attack the nylon thread itself; biting and pulling apart the threads.  Similar rescue behavior was found in other sand-dwelling Mediterranean ants, but only ''[[Cataglyphis floricola]]'' and ''[[Lasius grandis]]'' species of ants showed the same rescue behaviors of transporting sand away from the trapped victim and directing attention towards the nylon thread. It was observed in all ant species that rescue behavior was only directed towards nest mates. Ants of the same species from different nests were treated with aggression and were continually attacked and pursued, which speaks to the depths of ants discriminative abilities. This study brings up the possibility that if ants have the capacity for empathy and/or altruism, these complex processes may be derived from primitive and simpler mechanisms.

[[Dog|Canines]] have been hypothesized to share empathic-like responding towards human species. Researchers Custance and Mayer put individual dogs in an enclosure with their owner and a stranger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-012-0510-1 |last=Custance|first=Deborah|author2=Jennifer Mayer|title=Empathetic-like responding by domestic dogs (canis familiaris) to distress in humans|journal=Animal Cognition|date=29 May 2012|volume=15|issue=851–859|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0510-1|accessdate=October 5, 2014|pages=851–859|pmid=22644113}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the participants were talking or humming, the dog showed no behavioral changes, however when the participants were pretending to cry, the dogs oriented their behavior toward the person in distress whether it be the owner or stranger. The dogs approached the participants when crying in a submissive fashion, by sniffing, licking and nuzzling the distressed person. The dogs did not approach the participants in the usual form of excitement, tail wagging or panting. Since the dogs did not direct their empathic-like responses only towards their owner, it is hypothesized that dogs generally seek out humans showing distressing body behavior. Although this could insinuate that dogs have the cognitive capacity for empathy, this could also mean that domesticated dogs have learned to comfort distressed humans through generations of being rewarded for that specific behavior.

When witnessing chicks in distress, domesticated hens, ''[[Gallus gallus domesticus]]'' show emotional and physiological responding. Researchers Edgar, Paul and Nicol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Edgar|first=J|author2=Paul|title=Protective Mother Hens: Cognitive influences on the avian maternal response|journal=British Journal of Animal Behaviour|date=Aug 2013|volume=86|issue=2|pages=223–229|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.05.004|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=6&amp;sid=c35dba7e-d8a4-4b46-8855-20319f7a74e3%40sessionmgr4001&amp;hid=4214&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=psyh&amp;AN=2013-21521-001 |accessdate=March 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that in conditions where the chick was susceptible to danger, the mother hens heart rate increased, vocal alarms were sounded, personal preening decreased and body temperature increased. This responding happened whether or not the chick felt as if they were in danger. Mother hens experienced stress-induced hyperthermia only when the chick's behavior correlated with the perceived threat. Animal maternal behavior may be perceived as empathy, however, it could be guided by the evolutionary principles of survival and not emotionality.

'''Ergodic literature''' is a term [[neologism|coined]] by [[Espen J. Aarseth]] in his book ''Cybertext&amp;mdash;Perspectives on Ergodic Literature'', and is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] words ''ergon'', meaning "work", and ''hodos'', meaning "path". Aarseth's book contains the most commonly cited definition:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the text is trivial, with no [[wikt:extranoematic|extranoematic]] responsibilities placed on the reader except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of pages.&lt;ref name=Cybertext&gt;{{cite book|title=Cybertext&amp;mdash;Perspectives on Ergodic Literature|isbn=978-0801855795|first=Espen J.|last=Aarseth|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Cybertext]] is a subcategory of ergodic literature that Aarseth defines as "texts that involve calculation in their production of scriptons".&lt;ref name=Cybertext/&gt;{{rp|75}} The process of reading printed matter, in contrast, involves "trivial" extranoematic effort, that is, merely moving one's eyes along lines of text and turning pages.  Thus, [[hypertext fiction]] of the simple node and link variety is ergodic literature but not cybertext. A non-trivial effort is required for the reader to traverse the text, as the reader must constantly select which link to follow, but a link, when clicked, will always lead to the same node. A chat bot such as [[ELIZA]] is a cybertext because when the reader types in a sentence, the text-machine actually performs calculations on the fly that generate a textual response. The [[I Ching]] is likewise cited as an example of cybertext because it contains the rules for its own reading. The reader carries out the calculation but the rules are clearly embedded in the text itself. 

It has been argued that these distinctions are not entirely clear and scholars still debate the fine points of the definitions.&lt;ref name=Clarifying&gt;{{cite web|url=https://grandtextauto.soe.ucsc.edu/2005/08/12/clarifying-ergodic-and-cybertext/|title=Clarifying Ergodic and Cybertext|first=Noah|last=Wardrip-Fruin|work=Grand Text Auto|date=August 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the definition above, ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', and ''[[Being and Time]]'' are considered nonergodic literature as they require only "trivial...effort to traverse the text[s]". A stack of stained and mouldering newspapers, on the other hand, is ergodic literature.

One of the major innovations of the concept of ergodic literature is that it is not medium-specific. [[New media]] researchers have tended to focus on the medium of the text, stressing that it is for instance paper-based or electronic. Aarseth broke with this basic assumption that the medium was the most important distinction, and argued that the mechanics of texts need not be medium-specific. Ergodic literature is not defined by medium, but by the way in which the text functions. Thus, both paper-based and electronic texts can be ergodic: "The ergodic work of [[art]] is one that in a material sense includes the rules for its own use, a work that has certain requirements built in that automatically distinguishes between successful and unsuccessful users."&lt;ref name=Cybertext/&gt;{{rp|179}}

==Examples==

Examples given by Aarseth include a diverse group of texts: wall inscriptions of the temples in ancient [[Egypt]] that are connected two-dimensionally (on one wall) or three dimensionally (from wall to wall or room to room); the ''[[I Ching]]''; [[Apollinaire]]'s ''[[Calligrammes]]'' in which the words of the poem "are spread out in several directions to form a picture on the page, with no clear sequence in which to be read"; [[Marc Saporta]]'s ''Composition No. 1, Roman'', a novel with shuffleable pages; [[Raymond Queneau]]'s ''[[Hundred Thousand Billion Poems|One Hundred Thousand Billion Poems]]''; [[B. S. Johnson]]'s ''[[The Unfortunates]]''; [[Milorad Pavić (writer)|Milorad Pavić]]'s ''[[Dictionary of the Khazars]]'' and ''Landscape Painted with Tea''; [[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Pale Fire]]''; [[Joseph Weizenbaum]]'s ''[[ELIZA]]''; William Chamberlain and Thomas Etter's ''[[Racter]]''; [[Michael Joyce (writer)|Michael Joyce]]'s ''[[Afternoon, a story|Afternoon: a story]]''; Roy Trubshaw and [[Richard Bartle]]'s ''Multi-User Dungeon'' (aka ''[[Multi-User Dungeon#MUD the game|MUD1]]''); and James Aspnes's ''[[TinyMUD]]''. {{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Some other contemporary examples of this type of literature are [[Nick Bantock]]'s ''[[The Griffin and Sabine Trilogy]]'', ''[[S. (Dorst novel)|S.]]'' by [[J. J. Abrams]] and [[Doug Dorst]], ''[[Night Film: A Novel|Night Film]]'' by Marisha Pessl, and ''[[House of Leaves]]'' by [[Mark Z. Danielewski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://logger.believermag.com/post/2014/03/10/the-case-of-s-or-the-metatextual-pleasure-of | title=The Case of S., or, the Metatextual Pleasure of Ergodic Works | work=The Believer Logger | date=March 10, 2014 | accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All these examples require non-trivial effort from the reader, who must participate actively in the construction of the text.&lt;ref name=Clarifying/&gt;

The concepts of cybertext and ergodic literature were of seminal importance to new media studies, in particular literary approaches to digital texts and to game studies.

'''Erotic hypnosis''' is the practice of [[hypnosis]] for sexual purposes. This does not include [[hypnotherapy]] nor the therapeutic application of [[neurolinguistic programming]] and similar disciplines.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Although often loosely referred to as "recreational hypnosis", recreational hypnosis is a broader subject, including practices like [[stage hypnosis]] and hypnosis for the enjoyment of the practice itself.

== Practice ==
Reducing inhibitions and increasing arousal is a notable goal of erotic hypnosis. The placement of trigger words in the subject's mind as [[post-hypnotic suggestion]] to produce actions and experiences on-demand is a common practice. Erotic hypnosis can also include suggestions intended to improve sexual health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniels|first1=Angraecus|title=What is Erotic Hypnosis|url=http://www.hypnoticdreams.com/articles/erotic-hypnosis.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypnotic suggestions may include techniques to overcome apprehension about [[fellatio]], increase sensuality, and improve [[libido]].

Another common form of erotic hypnosis is hypnotic fantasy, in which the subject is placed in a trance and taken through a description of a sexual experience. Depending on the depth of the trance and the skill of the hypnotist, the subject's experience can range from mildly to deeply erotic.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Personality transformation is another common fantasy. People who identify with the submissive side of erotic hypnosis often fantasize about being freed from responsibilities or inhibitions and transformed into someone who can freely enjoy sexual pleasures.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

While there are numerous hypnotic techniques, fractionation—the process of repeatedly bringing someone in and out of trance—is a popular practice in erotic hypnosis.

Fractionation: in regards to seduction is a process of persuasion, combining both psychology and hypnosis.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

=== Power exchange relationships ===
Hypnosis is an increasingly popular practice within a [[dominance and submission]] relationship to reinforce power exchange and as a form of [[Play (BDSM)|play]]. This ranges from hypnotically-induced orgasms to long-term conditioning. The act of hypnosis itself can be erotic and relationship-affirming for many power exchange couples as the subject surrenders control and opens themselves to mental vulnerability.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In an interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |title=Kinky Mind Control |journal=Bizarre |issue=223 |pages=74–78 |publisher=Dennis Publishing |date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the January 2015 issue of [[Bizarre (magazine)|Bizarre]], Alex Tsander, billed therein as "Britain's premier fetish hypnotist", discussing hypnotism in the BDSM context, explicitly distinguished between the use of hypnotic themes in role-play and "real" induced effects. However, the distinction is arguably ambiguous and where one ends and the other begins may be unclear. Tsander himself insists that there is no such thing as a "state of hypnosis" but that hypnotic influence can elicit an authentic sense of loss of control through manipulation of multiple "antecedent variables". In his 2014 book on the topic, "Beyond Games of Trance", Tsander repeatedly warns about the clearly defined ethical scope within which the techniques he outlines for achieving such results can be considered acceptable.

== Non-hypnotic elements ==
Certain other practices such as persuasion techniques, conditioning, and neurolinguistic programming are often associated with erotic hypnosis, but are not strictly a part of it.

== Adult industry ==
Erotic hypnosis is a huge fetish in the adult industry.{{cn|date=April 2018}} It can be videos or audio.

== Social communities ==
Communities that are involved in erotic hypnosis are found on hypnomindcontrol.net, justtrance.net, and bondage.international. Those who use it need an IRC client or similar for access. Hypnomindcontrol.net and justtrance.net are networks dedicated exclusively to erotic hypnosis. Chatrooms such as these are used by those who enjoy erotic hypnosis. On [[Reddit]]/GoneWildAudio contains the most significant community of erotic hypnotists as well as hosting other erotic audio, other more exclusive subreddits also exist.

In the study of [[transsexualism]], the [[essentialism|essentialist]] idea of a '''feminine essence''' refers to the proposal that [[Trans woman|male-to-female transsexuals]] are females trapped in male bodies.  This idea has been interpreted in many senses, as a female mind, spirit, soul, personality, etc., as well as in more literal senses such as having a female brain structure; it is also a [[psychological narrative]], that is, a self-description of how some transsexuals see themselves, or of how they may portray themselves to qualify for certain medical treatments.

According to sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] and Kiira Triea, "the predominant cultural understanding of male-to-female transsexualism is that all male-to-female (MtF) transsexuals are, essentially, women trapped in men's bodies."  They reject the idea, claiming that "The persistence of the predominant cultural understanding, while explicable, is damaging to science and to many transsexuals."&lt;ref name=Bailey2007&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bailey J.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A figurative interpretation, involving neurologically mediated [[gender identity]], was supported historically by pioneering sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=HBS /&gt;

==Description==

The "feminine essence" idea predates modern psychological studies,&lt;ref name="How Sex Changed" /&gt; and was supported by some early sexologists such as [[Harry Benjamin]] ("the father of transsexualism"), who revived the idea of [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]] that a person might have a "female soul trapped in a male body."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern researchers classify the common story told by transsexual women about themselves as a [[psychological narrative]], and therefore refer to this idea as the "feminine essence narrative".  In his book ''[[The Man Who Would Be Queen]]'', sexologist [[J. Michael Bailey]] gives these statements as a prototypical example of the feminine essence narrative:  "Since I can remember, I have always felt as if I were a member of the other sex. I have felt like a freak with this body and detest my penis. I must get sex reassignment surgery (a "sex change operation") in order to match my external body with my internal mind."&lt;ref name =Dreger2008/&gt;

==Blanchard's deconstruction==

In 2008, [[Ray Blanchard]] presented the idea in the form of a theory in a commentary entitled "Deconstructing the Feminine Essence Narrative" in which he lists what he considers to be "the central tenets of the feminine essence theory", and then refutes each of these tenets:&lt;ref name = Blanchard2008/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;

#Male-to-female transsexuals are, in some literal sense and not just in a figurative sense, women inside men’s bodies.
#There is only one type of woman, therefore there can be only one type of (true) male-to-female transsexual.
#Apparent differences among male-to-female transsexuals are relatively superficial and irrelevant to the basic unity of the transsexual syndrome.
#Male-to-female transsexuals have no unique, behavioral or psychological characteristics that are absent in typical men and women.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Neuroanatomic research==

According to Bailey and Triea,&lt;ref name=Bailey2007/&gt; one of the predictions based on the feminine essence theory is that male-to-female transsexuals would possess female rather than male brain anatomy. A widely cited research study of this topic examined the brain anatomy of six deceased male-to-female transsexuals, who had undergone during their lives hormonal treatment and surgical sex reassignment.&lt;ref name=Zhou1995&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Zhou J. N. |author2=Hofman M. A. |author3=Gooren L. J. G. |author4=Swaab D. F. | year = 1995 | title = A sex difference in the human brain and its relation to transsexuality | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 378 | issue = 6552| pages = 68–70 | doi = 10.1038/378068a0 | pmid = 7477289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study reported that a brain structure called the "central subdivision of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis" (BSTc), which is larger in typical males than in typical females, was in the female range in the transsexual subjects. The interpretation and the methods of that study have been criticized,&lt;ref name=LawrenceWeb&gt;[http://www.annelawrence.com/twr/brain-sex_critique.html Transsexual women’s resources, by Dr. Anne Lawrence]&lt;/ref&gt; and the finding continues to be a matter of debate.

Neurological research has found that the brains of transsexuals differ in a number of ways.  For example, a study done on the brains of non-homosexual transsexuals using MRI and pheromones as stimuli found that transsexuals process smelling androgen and estrogen in the same way that women do. Previous research by the same team found that homosexual males also process smelling the pheromones of the sexes in a way that is similar to that of women.&lt;ref name="pheroMTF"&gt;[http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/bhm216v1?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;title=transsexual&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;andorexacttitleabs=and&amp;andorexactfulltext=and&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT "Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids"], by H. Berglund1,  P. Lindström2,  C. Dhejne-Helmy3 and  I. Savic2, Cerebral Cortex&lt;/ref&gt;   Work done by [[Simon LeVay]] had previously found that the hypothalamus of homosexual males has a region which is similar in size to that of heterosexual females.&lt;ref name="levay"&gt;[http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs.cmu.edu/user/scotts/bulgarians/nature-nurture/levay.html A Difference in Hypothalmic Structure Between Heterosexual and Homosexual Men Simon LeVay]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is not so in non-homosexual males.&lt;ref name="levay"/&gt; Last but not least a study done by Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol reached the conclusion that the brain does change in overall volume and the volume of its parts with the use of cross-sex hormone supplements.&lt;ref name="CSCB"&gt;[http://www.eje-online.org/cgi/content/abstract/155/suppl_1/S107 Changing your sex changes your brain: influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure] Hilleke E Hulshoff Pol,  Peggy T Cohen-Kettenis1,  Neeltje E M Van Haren,  Jiska S Peper, Rachel G H Brans,  Wiepke Cahn,  Hugo G Schnack,  Louis J G Gooren2 and  René S Kahn&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of male-to-female transsexuals, the brain assumes the proportions of a female brain.&lt;ref name="CSCB"/&gt;

==Other findings==

The main support for the feminine essence narrative is that many male-to-female transsexuals say they feel it to be true; many autobiographical and clinical accounts by or about transsexual individuals contain variations of the statement of having a female soul or needing to make the external body resemble the inner or true self.&lt;ref name=Brown1996&gt;Brown, M. L., &amp; Rounsley, C. A. (1996). ''True selves: Understanding transsexualism.'' San Francisco: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ettner1999&gt;Ettner, R. (1999). ''Gender loving care: A guide to counseling gender-variant clients.'' New York: W. W. Norton.{{ISBN|0393703045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of this narrative consider it to be inconsistent with their research findings.  Blanchard has reported finding that there are two, and not one, types of male-to-female transsexual and that they differ with regard to their sexual interests, whether they were overtly gender atypical in childhood, how easily they pass as female, the ages at which they decide to transition to female, birth order, and their physical height and weight.&lt;ref name=Blanchard1990&gt;Blanchard, R., &amp; Steiner, B. W. (1990). ''Clinical management of gender identity disorders in children and adults.'' Washington, DC: American Psychiatric Press. {{ISBN|0-88048-187-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Smith2005a&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Smith Y. L. S.|author2= van Goozen S. H. M.|author3= Kuiper A.

==Role of medical community==

Since the medical community has guidelines for what types of individuals qualify for [[sex reassignment surgery]], transsexual persons sometimes adopt and tell the story that they believe will best help them qualify – the "feminine essence narrative" – and representing themselves as "essentially female", which may explain at least part of the prevalence of the feminine essence narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Terminology==

The phrase "feminine soul enclosed in a male body" (''anima muliebris in corpore virili inclusa'') was introduced in 1868 by [[Karl-Heinrich Ulrichs]], not to describe male-to-female transsexuals, none of whom existed yet as such, but to describe a type of gay men who self-identified as feminine.&lt;ref name=Ulrichs1868&gt;Ulrichs, Karl-Heinrich (1868). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=k-2eOwAACAAJ&amp;dq=intitle:Memnon+inauthor:Ulrichs&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions_r&amp;cad=0_2 "Memnon.": Die Geschlechtsnatur des mannliebenden Urnings, eine naturwissenschaftliche Darstellung: körperlich-seelischer Hermaphroditismus.

{{Expand German|Waldpädagogik|date=June 2017}}

'''Forest school,''' is a [[outdoor education]] delivery model in which children (or adults) visit natural spaces to learn personal, social and technical skills. It has been defined as "an inspirational process that offers children, young people and adults regular opportunities to achieve and develop confidence through hands-on learning in a woodland environment".&lt;ref name="fsrs"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.forestresearch.gov.uk/pdf/SERG_Forest_School_research_summary.pdf/$FILE/SERG_Forest_School_research_summary.pdf|title=Forest School Research Summary|year=2008|publisher=Forest Research|last=O'Brien|first=Liz|last2=Murray|first2=Richard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest school is both a [[pedagogy]] and a physical entity, with the use often being interchanged. The plural "schools" is often used when referring to a number of groups or sessions.  There is no single definition of "forest school", and as of 2018 known attempts to commercialize the term via trademark or copyright have been unsuccessful.

Forest school uses the woods and forests as a means to build independence and [[self-esteem]] in children and young adults.Topics are cross-curriculum (broad in subject) including the natural environment, for example the role of trees in society, the complex ecosystem supported by a wilderness, and recognition of specific plants and animals. However, the personal skills are considered highly valuable, such as teamwork and problem solving.&lt;ref name="What is Forest School?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/what-is-forest-school|publisher=Forest School Association|title=What is Forest School}}&lt;/ref&gt; The woodland environment may be used to learn about more abstract concepts such as mathematics and communication. Forest school provision is also called ''nature schools''.

== Activities and scope ==

In the UK Model schedules within forest schools vary, but one approach is to take school learners to woodland for once a week, with an initial 6 week observation and assessment period, where a baseline is produced for each child in terms of areas of their holistic development, with particular emphasis on their social and emotional aspects of learning (SEAL). Once the baseline assessment has been produced the Forest School Leader / Practitioner will then continue with the long term programme over the course of the learning period in order to support the child in their development and learning. The practitioner will provide opportunities for each child to develop in areas that have been identified as requiring interventions or support of any kind&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title = A guide to Forest School in Wales|url = http://www.forestschoolleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AguidetoForestSchoolsinWales.pdf|year = 2009|publisher = Forestry Commission Wales}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duration and frequency of visits influences the degree of outcome; more time spent in forest school brings greater benefits.&lt;ref name="review-outdoor"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.field-studies-council.org/documents/general/NFER/A_review_of_research_on_outdoor_learning.pdf| title=A Review of Research on Outdoor Learning| last=Rickinson| first=Mark| last2=Dillon|first2=Justin| last3=Teamey| first3=Kelly| publisher=National Foundation for Educational Research and King's College London| date=March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visits should ideally continue throughout the year, allowing children to experience all weathers and the changing seasons.

Forest schools are for all learners, of any age, often "led by the learner`s interests" (learner initiated learning) by comparison to other [[outdoor education]] which "starts with an issue agenda or problem for the learner to investigate".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Massey|first=Sam|title=The Benefits of a Forest School Experience for Children in their Early Years|url=http://www.forestschoolleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Massey-benefits-of-forest-school-research.pdf|publisher=National Foundation for Educational Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goals of forest school in primary  age children includes encouraging curiosity and exploration with all of the senses, empowering children in the natural environment, and encouraging spatial awareness and motor development.&lt;ref name="What is Forest School?" /&gt; Forest schools usually provide a higher adult to child ratio than some learning styles, in order to ensure children are supported sufficiently in a higher risk environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/history-of-forest-school/&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyond primary school age children, forest school is frequently used to further develop social skills and explore creative learning and focuses on developing firm foundations for continued personal and education development.  In particular it has been used as an alternative curriculum provision to support continued mainstream education involvement, or as a temporary/transitional approach back into school.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Consistent with [[attention restoration theory]], children taking part in forest school have been described as more relaxed.&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"/&gt; Relationships between the children and each other, with adults, and with the environment, are important&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|url=http://www.greenlighttrust.org/Forest%20Schools/ARU%20Conference%20Paper%2019042007%20-%20Sara%20Bond.doc|title=Forest School: relational pedagogy in action|date=April 2007|place=Anglia Ruskin University|booktitle=Reclaiming Relational Pedagogy in Early Childhood: Learning from International Experience|last=Bond|first=Sara|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726131909/http://www.greenlighttrust.org/Forest%20Schools/ARU%20Conference%20Paper%2019042007%20-%20Sara%20Bond.doc|archivedate=2011-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forest school is part of the broader area of [[outdoor education]]. Outside the school curriculum, this extends to summer holiday camps, [[Scouting]], Outward Bound projects and many other activities. Before children reach school age, [[Forest kindergarten]]s provide a similar service.

Forest school is currently taking place in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, USA, Malaysia, Switzerland, Spain, Ireland, Germany and United Kingdom.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

== Supporting Children With Exceptionalities  ==

The combination of freedom and responsibility has been particularly beneficial to children who suffer from lack of confidence or whose behaviour is challenging. With high adult:child ratios, children can safely experience activities that are often prohibited, such as climbing trees or lighting fires.Children have the freedom to explore the area within the forest, this helps the child to learn to manage their own safety and move around comfortably.&lt;ref name="Knight, S 2009"&gt;Knight, S (2009) Forest schools and outdoor learning in the early years. London, SAGE publications&lt;/ref&gt; The programme allows children to grow in confidence and independence and extend their abilities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Some children do not perform well in classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KhhF091QZEC&amp;pg=PA77|page=77|title=Developing children's behaviour in the classroom: a practical guide for Teachers and Students|first=Sonia|last=Burnard|publisher=Falmer Press|year=1998|isbn=0-7507-0722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are encouraged to develop their innate curiosity and develop the motivation to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Brien, L; Murray,R (2006)A marvellous opportunity for children to learn [http://www.forestry.gov.uk/pdf/fr0112forestschoolsreport.pdf/$FILE/fr0112forestschoolsreport.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; They may come from a non-academic family background, may have a short [[attention span]], or may just not be comfortable with the organisation of a teacher standing in front of a group of pupils.

== History ==

=== Sweden and Denmark ===

In the 1950s the idea was created in Denmark and shortly there after in Sweden. In Denmark it became an embedded part of the curriculum for pre-school children (under seven years) stemming from their småbørnspædagogik, or 'Early childhood education'. Children attending Forest kindergartens were in most cases arriving at school with strong social skills, the ability to work in groups effectively, high self-esteem, and confidence in their own capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

In 1957, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] man, Goesta Frohm, created the "Skogsmulle" concept to promote learning about nature, water, mountains and pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skogsmullestiftelsen.org/eng/index.htm Skogsmulle Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; With an increasing focus on measurable outcomes, forest schools have gained acceptance as an educational method in their own right. In Denmark, nature schools as well as [[forest kindergarten]]s are popular with both school teachers and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Fuks|first=Vlada|url=http://diggy.ruc.dk/bitstream/1800/334/1/Environmental_education_and.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620232945/http://diggy.ruc.dk/bitstream/1800/334/1/Environmental_education_and.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-06-20|title=Environmental Education and Nature Schools in Denmark|year=2004|publisher=Roskilde University, Denmark}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[biophilia hypothesis]] argues that a love of nature is instinctive. The term [[nature deficit disorder]], coined by Richard Louv in his 2005 book ''Last Child in the Woods'', recognises the erosion of this by the urbanisation of human society. [[Attention restoration theory]] and related psychological work has proven health benefits in reduced stress, improved concentration and improved medical outcomes from surgery. Scandinavian countries, rich in woodland, have maintained the human link more closely. Forest schools practice is based on up-to date pedagogy and andragogy.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

=== United Kingdom ===
  
This ethos was introduced to the [[United Kingdom|UK]] during the 1990s from Denmark. The growth of forest school has been unprecedented throughout the UK developing into a separate and distinct model called the UK Model. [[Bridgwater College]] in Somerset was the pioneer of the forest school concept in the UK in 1994 after traveling to Denmark to observe the Danish/Nordic Model of Forest Kindergartens for a few days.&lt;ref name="Knight, S 2009"/&gt;

Various government and [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] agencies propose the use of woodland as part of the school educational curriculum; for example the Forest Education Initiative&lt;ref name="fei"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foresteducation.org/forest_schools.php?page=1|title=What is an FEI Forest School?|publisher=Forest Education Initiative|year=2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201053814/http://www.foresteducation.org/forest_schools.php?page=1|archivedate=2010-02-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Forestry Commission]].&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6cjdgl|title=Woods for Learning Education Strategy|year=2005|publisher=Forestry Commission Scotland|isbn=0-85538-684-3|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912012111/http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/infd-6cjdgl|archivedate=2009-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2006, there were approximately 140 forest schools in Britain.&lt;ref name="fsrs"/&gt;

The governmental agencies have in some cases been set targets for the use of their resources for education or health benefits,&lt;ref name="woodsforlearning"/&gt; or are focused on the educational outcomes and see forestry as a step towards them.&lt;ref name="earlyyearsframework"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/257007/0076309.pdf#page=31|title=Early Years Framework|publisher=Scottish Government|isbn=978-0-7559-5942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many businesses and non-profit organizations facilitate forest school long term programmes. In [[Wales]], training and strategic oversight is provided by Forest Schools Wale] and government agencies such as the [[Forestry Commission]] who have supported research and the development of practical experience for forest school practitioners. In [[England]], support has been provided by the Forest Education Network (which has replaced the Forest Education Initiative) to those initiating forest school provision. Such provision is provided within schools using their own trained staff or by external independent forest school providers.

Many organisations now offer training courses designed for the UK to enable practitioners to deliver forest school in their own settings and ensure children and teachers work within rich natural experiences.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The OCN Level 3 training course is most widely recognised within the UK.

Developing from the Institute of Outdoor Learning's (IOL) Forest School Special Interest Group, in June 2012 The Forest School Association was established as an independent UK body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/history-of-forest-school/|title=History of Forest School}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Inspired by international developments, the first Canadian forest school was created by Marlene Power in 2007. It was named Carp Ridge Preschool and was located near Ottawa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacEachren|first=Zabe|date=Autumn 2013|title=The Canadian Forest School Movement|url=http://www.learninglandscapes.ca/index.php/learnland/issue/view/33/Vol%207%20No%201%20%282013%29%3A%20Early%20Childhood%20Education%3A%20Successes%20and%20Challenges|journal=LEARNing Landscapes|volume=7|pages=219–233|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Power founded and became the executive director of Forest School Canada, an educational initiative of the Child and Nature Alliance of Canada.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forest and Nature School in Canada|last=|first=|publisher=Forest School Canada|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=1–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forest School Canada is focused on being a "network for support, education, and accreditation for concepts associated with the FS movement in Canada."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The movement has spread into Canada's provinces and is primary associated with private schools.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, there is emerging support from public schools such as the Nature Kindergarten pilot which is a partnership between the Sooke District School Board and the University of Victoria’s Centre for Early Childhood Research and Policy, Royal Roads University, and Camosun College’s Early Learning and Care Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturekindergarten.sd62.bc.ca/proposal/|title=Proposal for a Nature Kindergarten {{!}} Nature Kindergarten|website=naturekindergarten.sd62.bc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use of Terminology ==
Attempts have been made to [[copyright]] and [[trademark]] generic terms related to forest school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade marking terms that are generic within the Forest School sector|url=http://www.forestschoolassociation.org/trade-marking-terms-that-are-generic-within-the-forest-school-sector/|accessdate=16 May 2014|author=Forest School Association|date=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no known protection of the term "forest school" or "forest schools".

'''Gestalt psychology''' or '''gestaltism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ({{IPAc-en|g|ə|ˈ|ʃ|t|ɑː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|ʃ|t|ɔː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|l|t|,_|-|ˈ|s|t|ɔː|l|t}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/gestalt "gestalt"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang-de|Gestalt}} {{IPA-de|ɡəˈʃtalt|}} "shape, form") is a philosophy of mind of the [[Berlin School of experimental psychology]]. Gestalt psychology is an attempt to understand the laws behind the ability to acquire and maintain meaningful perceptions in an apparently chaotic world. The central principle of gestalt psychology is that the mind forms a [[holism|global whole]] with self-organizing tendencies.

This principle maintains that when the human mind (perceptual system) forms a percept or "gestalt", the whole has a reality of its own, independent of the parts. The original famous phrase of Gestalt psychologist [[Kurt Koffka]], "the whole is ''something else'' than the sum of its parts"&lt;ref&gt;Koffka 1935, Principles of Gestalt Psychology, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; is often incorrectly translated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuck|first=Michael|url=http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/gestalt-principles-applied-in-design/|title=Gestalt Principles Applied in Design |date=Aug 17, 2010|accessdate=2014-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as "The whole is ''greater'' than the sum of its parts", and thus used when explaining gestalt theory, and further incorrectly applied to [[systems theory]].&lt;ref&gt;David Hothersall: ''History of Psychology'', chapter seven, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Koffka did not like the translation. He firmly corrected students who replaced "other" with "greater". "This is not a principle of addition" he said.&lt;ref&gt;Heider, F. 1977. Cited in Dewey, R.A. 2007. [http://www.intropsych.com/ch04_senses/whole_is_other_than_the_sum_of_the_parts.html Psychology: An introduction: Chapter four - The Whole is Other than the Sum of the Parts]. Retrieved 4/12/2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole has an independent existence.

In the study of [[perception]], Gestalt psychologists stipulate that perceptions are the products of complex interactions among various stimuli. Contrary to the [[behaviorist]] approach to focusing on stimulus and response, gestalt psychologists sought to understand the ''organization'' of cognitive processes (Carlson and Heth, 2010). Our brain is capable of generating whole forms, particularly with respect to the visual recognition of global figures instead of just collections of simpler and unrelated elements (points, lines, curves, etc.).

In psychology, gestaltism is often opposed to [[structuralism (psychology)|structuralism]]. Gestalt theory, it is proposed, allows for the deconstruction of the whole situation into its elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Humphrey | first1 = G | year = 1924 | title = The psychology of the gestalt | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = 7| pages = 401–412 | doi = 10.1037/h0070207 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The concept of gestalt was first introduced in philosophy and psychology in 1890 by [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] (a member of the [[School of Brentano]]). The idea of gestalt has its roots in theories by [[David Hume]], [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]],  and [[Ernst Mach]]. [[Max Wertheimer]]'s unique contribution was to insist that the "gestalt" is perceptually primary, defining the parts it was composed from, rather than being a secondary quality that emerges from those parts, as von Ehrenfels's earlier ''Gestalt-Qualität'' had been.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

Both von Ehrenfels and [[Edmund Husserl]] seem to have been inspired by Mach's work ''Beiträge zur Analyse der Empfindungen'' (Contributions to the Analysis of Sensations, 1886), in formulating their very similar concepts of ''gestalt'' and ''figural moment'', respectively. On the philosophical foundations of these ideas see Foundations of Gestalt Theory (Smith, ed., 1988).

Early 20th century theorists, such as [[Kurt Koffka]], [[Max Wertheimer]], and [[Wolfgang Köhler]] (students of [[Carl Stumpf]]) saw objects as perceived within an environment according to all of their elements taken together as a global construct. This 'gestalt' or 'whole form' approach sought to define principles of [[perception]]—seemingly innate mental laws that determined the way objects were perceived. It is based on the here and now, and in the way things are seen. Images can be divided into [[Figure–ground (perception)|figure or ground]]. The question is what is perceived at first glance: the figure in front, or the background.

These laws took several forms, such as the grouping of similar, or proximate, objects together, within this global process. Although gestalt has been criticized for being merely descriptive,&lt;ref name=BruceEtAl/&gt; it has formed the basis of much further research into the perception of patterns and objects (Carlson et al. 2000), and of research into behavior, thinking, problem solving and psychopathology.

===Gestalt therapy===
The founders of [[Gestalt therapy]], [[Fritz Perls|Fritz]] and [[Laura Perls]], had worked with [[Kurt Goldstein]], a neurologist who had applied principles of Gestalt psychology to the functioning of the organism. Laura Perls had been a Gestalt psychologist before she became a psychoanalyst and before she began developing Gestalt therapy together with Fritz Perls.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Bocian: ''Fritz Perls in Berlin 1893–1933. Expressionism – Psychonalysis – Judaism'', 2010, p. 190, EHP Verlag Andreas Kohlhage, Bergisch Gladbach.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which Gestalt psychology influenced Gestalt therapy is disputed, however. In any case it is not identical with Gestalt psychology. On the one hand, Laura Perls preferred not to use the term "Gestalt" to name the emerging new therapy, because she thought that the gestalt psychologists would object to it;&lt;ref&gt;Joe Wysong/Edward Rosenfeld (eds): ''An Oral History of Gestalt Therapy'', Highland, New York 1982, The Gestalt Journal Press, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand Fritz and Laura Perls clearly adopted some of Goldstein's work.&lt;ref&gt;Allen R. Barlow,  [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm "Gestalt-Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident"], ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, (Fall, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, though recognizing the historical connection and the influence, most gestalt psychologists emphasize that gestalt therapy is not a form of gestalt psychology.

Mary Henle noted in her presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association (1975): "What Perls has done has been to take a few terms from Gestalt psychology, stretch their meaning beyond recognition, mix them with notions—often unclear and often incompatible—from the depth psychologies, existentialism, and common sense, and he has called the whole mixture gestalt therapy. His work has no substantive relation to scientific Gestalt psychology. To use his own language, Fritz Perls has done 'his thing'; whatever it is, it is ''not'' Gestalt psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Mary Henle 1975: [http://gestalttheory.net/archive/henle.html ''Gestalt Psychology and Gestalt Therapy'']; Presidential address to Division 24 at the meeting of the American Psychological Association, Chicago, September 1975. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences 14, pp 23-32.&lt;/ref&gt; With her analysis however, she restricts herself explicitly to only three of Perls' books from 1969 and 1972, leaving out Perls' earlier work, and Gestalt therapy in general as a psychotherapy method.&lt;ref&gt;See Barlow criticizing Henle: Allen R. Barlow: [http://www.gestalt.org/barlow.htm ''Gestalt Therapy and Gestalt Psychology. Gestalt – Antecedent Influence or Historical Accident''], in: ''The Gestalt Journal'', Volume IV, Number 2, Fall, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been clinical applications of Gestalt psychology in the psychotherapeutic field long before Perls'ian Gestalt therapy, in group psychoanalysis (Foulkes), Adlerian individual psychology, by Gestalt psychologists in psychotherapy like Erwin Levy, Abraham S. Luchins, by Gestalt psychologically oriented psychoanalysts in Italy (Canestrari and others), and there have been newer developments foremost in Europe, e.g. [[Gestalt theoretical psychotherapy]].

==Theoretical framework and methodology==
The school of gestalt practiced a series of theoretical and methodological principles that attempted to redefine the approach to psychological research. This is in contrast to investigations developed at the beginning of the 20th century, based on traditional scientific methodology, which divided the object of study into a set of elements that could be analyzed separately with the objective of reducing the complexity of this object.

The theoretical principles are the following:
* '''Principle of Totality'''—The conscious experience must be considered globally (by taking into account all the physical and mental aspects of the individual simultaneously) because the nature of the mind demands that each component be considered as part of a [[system]] of dynamic relationships.
* '''Principle of [[psychophysical parallelism|psychophysical]] [[isomorphism (Gestalt psychology)|isomorphism]]''' – A [[correlation]] exists between conscious experience and [[Human brain|cerebral]] activity.

Based on the principles above the following methodological principles are defined:
* '''Phenomenon experimental analysis'''—In relation to the Totality Principle any psychological research should take phenomena as a starting point and not be solely focused on sensory qualities.
* '''Biotic experiment'''—The school of gestalt established a need to conduct ''real experiments'' that sharply contrasted with and opposed classic laboratory experiments. This signified experimenting in natural situations, developed in real conditions, in which it would be possible to reproduce, with higher [[fidelity]], what would be habitual for a subject.&lt;ref&gt;William Ray Woodward, Robert Sonné Cohen – World views and scientific discipline formation: science studies in the German Democratic Republic : papers from a German-American summer institute, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support from cybernetics and neurology==
In the 1940s and 1950s, [[laboratory]] research in [[neurology]] and what became known as [[cybernetics]] on the mechanism of frogs' eyes indicate that [[perception]] of 'gestalts' (in particular gestalts ''in motion'') is perhaps more primitive and fundamental than 'seeing' as such:

:A frog hunts on land by vision... He has no fovea, or region of greatest acuity in vision, upon which he must center a part of the image... The frog does not seem to see or, at any rate, is not concerned with the detail of stationary parts of the world around him. He will starve to death surrounded by food if it is not moving. His choice of food is determined only by size and movement. He will leap to capture any object the size of an insect or worm, providing it moves like one. He can be fooled easily not only by a piece of dangled meat but by any moving small object... He does remember a moving thing provided it stays within his field of vision and he is not distracted.&lt;ref&gt;Lettvin, J.Y., Maturana, H.R., Pitts, W.H., and McCulloch, W.S. (1961). Two Remarks on the Visual System of the Frog. In Sensory Communication edited by Walter Rosenblith, MIT Press and John Wiley and Sons: New York&lt;/ref&gt;

:The lowest-level concepts related to visual perception for a human being probably differ little from the concepts of a frog. In any case, the structure of the [[retina]] in [[mammal]]s and in [[human being]]s is the same as in amphibians. The phenomenon of distortion of [[perception]] of an image stabilized on the retina gives some idea of the concepts of the subsequent levels of the hierarchy. This is a very interesting phenomenon. When a person looks at an immobile object, "fixes" it with his eyes, the eyeballs do not remain absolutely immobile; they make small involuntary movements. As a result the image of the object on the retina is constantly in motion, slowly drifting and jumping back to the point of maximum sensitivity. The image "marks time" in the vicinity of this point.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Fedorovich Turchin – The phenomenon of science – a cybernetic approach to human evolution – Columbia University Press, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
The key principles of gestalt systems are emergence, reification, [[multistability]] and [[wikt:invariance|invariance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/52051454|title=The World in your Head: A Gestalt View of the Mechanism of Conscious Experience|last=Steven.|first=Lehar,|date=2003|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=|isbn=0805841768|location=Mahwah, N.J.|pages=|oclc=52051454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergence===
This is demonstrated by the ''dog picture'', which depicts a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] dog sniffing the ground in the shade of overhanging trees. The dog is not recognized by first identifying its parts (feet, ears, nose, tail, etc.), and then inferring the dog from those component parts.  Instead, the dog appears as a whole, all at once. Gestalt theory does not have an explanation for how this perception of a dog appears.

{{clear left}}

===Reification===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Reification]] --&gt;
{{See also|Reification (fallacy)}}

[[Image:Reification.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Reification]]

Reification is the ''constructive'' or ''generative'' aspect of perception, by which the experienced percept contains more explicit spatial information than the sensory stimulus on which it is based.

For instance, a triangle is perceived in picture '''A''', though no triangle is there. In pictures '''B''' and '''D''' the eye recognizes disparate shapes as "belonging" to a single shape, in '''C''' a complete three-dimensional shape is seen, where in actuality no such thing is drawn.

Reification can be explained by progress in the study of [[illusory contours]], which are treated by the visual system as "real" contours.

{{clear left}}

===Multistability===
[[Image:Multistability.svg|left|thumb|260px|the [[Necker cube]] and the [[Rubin vase]], two examples of [[multistability]]]]

[[Multistability]] (or [[multistable perception]]) is the tendency of ambiguous perceptual experiences to pop back and forth unstably between two or more alternative interpretations. This is seen, for example, in the [[Necker cube]] and [[Rubin vase|Rubin's Figure/Vase illusion]] shown here. Other examples include the [[Blivet|three-legged blivet]] and artist [[M. C. Escher]]'s artwork and the appearance of flashing [[Marquee (sign)|marquee]] lights moving first one direction and then suddenly the other. Again, gestalt does not explain ''how'' images appear multistable, only that they ''do''.

{{clear left}}

===Invariance===
[[Image:Invariance.jpg|left|thumb|260px|Invariance]]

Invariance is the property of [[perception]] whereby simple [[geometrical]] objects are recognized independent of rotation, translation, and scale; as well as several other variations such as elastic deformations, different lighting, and different component features. For example, the objects in '''A''' in the figure are all immediately recognized as the same basic shape, which are immediately distinguishable from the forms in '''B'''. They are even recognized despite perspective and elastic deformations as in '''C''', and when depicted using different graphic elements as in '''D'''. Computational theories of vision, such as those by [[David Marr (psychologist)|David Marr]], have provided alternate explanations of how perceived objects are classified.

Emergence, reification, multistability, and invariance are not necessarily separable modules to model individually, but they could be different aspects of a single unified [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html |title=Gestalt Isomorphism |publisher=Sharp.bu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217033046/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/bubw3/bubw3.html|archivedate=2012-02-17|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Prägnanz''==
{{Main|Principles of grouping}}

The fundamental principle of gestalt [[perception]] is the law of ''{{ill|prägnanz|de|Prägnanz|vertical-align=sup}}'' (in the German language, ''pithiness''), which says that we tend to order our experience in a manner that is regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple.  Gestalt [[psychologist]]s attempt to discover refinements of the law of ''prägnanz'', and this involves writing down [[laws]] that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, what are often called "gestalt laws".&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych"&gt;Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Third Edition, [[Thomson Wadsworth]]© 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Gestalt proximity.svg|right|thumb|Law of proximity]]
[[Image:Gestalt similarity.svg|right|thumb|Law of similarity]]
[[Image:Gestalt closure.svg|right|thumb|Law of closure]]
[[Image:Law of Symmetry.jpg|right|thumb]]
A major aspect of Gestalt [[psychology]] is that it implies that the [[mind]] understands external stimuli as whole rather than the sum of their parts.  The wholes are structured and organized using grouping laws.  The various laws are called ''laws'' or ''principles'', depending on the paper where they appear—but for simplicity's sake, this article uses the term ''laws''. These laws deal with the sensory modality of vision. However, there are analogous laws for other sensory modalities including auditory, tactile, gustatory and olfactory (Bregman – GP).  The visual Gestalt principles of grouping were introduced in Wertheimer (1923).  Through the 1930s and '40s Wertheimer, Kohler and Koffka formulated many of the laws of grouping through the study of visual [[perception]].

# '''Law of Proximity'''—The law of proximity states that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group.  For example, in the figure that illustrates the Law of proximity, there are 72 circles, but we perceive the collection of circles in groups.  Specifically, we perceive that there is a group of 36 circles on the left side of the image, and three groups of 12 circles on the right side of the image.  This law is often used in advertising logos to emphasize which aspects of events are associated.&lt;ref name=stevenson&gt;{{cite web|last=Stevenson|first=Herb|title=Emergence: The Gestalt Approach to Change|url=http://www.clevelandconsultinggroup.com/articles/emergence-gestalt-approach-to-change.php|publisher=Unleashing Executive and Orzanizational Potential|accessdate=7 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Soegaard&gt;{{cite web|last=Soegaard|first=Mads|title=Gestalt Principles of form Perception|url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html|publisher=Interaction Design|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Similarity'''—The law of similarity states that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other.  This similarity can occur in the form of shape, colour, shading or other qualities.  For example, the figure illustrating the law of similarity portrays 36 circles all equal distance apart from one another forming a square.  In this depiction, 18 of the circles are shaded dark, and 18 of the circles are shaded light.  We perceive the dark circles as grouped together and the light circles as grouped together, forming six horizontal lines within the square of circles. This perception of lines is due to the law of similarity.&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;
# '''Law of Closure'''—The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete.  Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap. Research shows that the reason the mind completes a regular figure that is not perceived through sensation is to increase the regularity of surrounding stimuli. For example, the figure that depicts the law of closure portrays what we perceive as a circle on the left side of the image and a rectangle on the right side of the image.  However, gaps are present in the shapes.  If the law of closure did not exist, the image would depict an assortment of different lines with different lengths, rotations, and curvatures—but with the law of closure, we perceptually combine the lines into whole shapes.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gizmodo.co.uk/2013/05/why-your-brain-thinks-these-dots-are-a-dog/|title=Why Your Brain Thinks These Dots Are a Dog|website=Gizmodo UK|language=en|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Symmetry'''—The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts.  Therefore, when two symmetrical elements are unconnected the mind perceptually connects them to form a coherent shape.  Similarities between symmetrical objects increase the likelihood that objects are grouped to form a combined symmetrical object. For example, the figure depicting the law of symmetry shows a configuration of square and curled brackets.  When the image is perceived, we tend to observe three pairs of symmetrical brackets rather than six individual brackets.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Soegaard"/&gt;
# '''Law of Common Fate'''—The law of common fate states that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that movement of elements of an object produce paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on. We perceive elements of objects to have trends of motion, which indicate the path that the object is on. The law of continuity implies the grouping together of objects that have the same trend of motion and are therefore on the same path.  For example, if there are an array of dots and half the dots are moving upward while the other half are moving downward, we would perceive the upward moving dots and the downward moving dots as two distinct units.&lt;ref name=todorvic&gt;{{cite web|last=Todorovic|first=Dejan|title=Gestalt Principles|url=http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Gestalt_principles |website=Scholarpedia.org |publisher=[[Scholarpedia]] |accessdate=5 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Law of Continuity'''—The law of continuity states that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object.  In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities. Stimuli remain distinct even with overlap.  We are less likely to group elements with sharp abrupt directional changes as being one object.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;
# '''Law of Good Gestalt'''—The law of good gestalt explains that elements of objects tend to be perceptually grouped together if they form a pattern that is regular, simple, and orderly. This law implies that as individuals perceive the world, they eliminate complexity and unfamiliarity so they can observe a reality in its most simplistic form.  Eliminating extraneous stimuli helps the mind create meaning.  This meaning created by perception implies a global regularity, which is often mentally prioritized over spatial relations. The law of good gestalt focuses on the idea of conciseness, which is what all of gestalt theory is based on. This law has also been called the '''law of Prägnanz'''.&lt;ref name="stevenson"/&gt;  Prägnanz is a German word that directly translates to mean "pithiness" and implies the ideas of salience, conciseness and orderliness.&lt;ref name="todorvic"/&gt;
# '''Law of Past Experience'''—The law of past experience implies that under some circumstances visual stimuli are categorized according to past experience.  If two objects tend to be observed within close proximity, or small temporal intervals, the objects are more likely to be perceived together.  For example, the English language contains 26 letters that are grouped to form words using a set of rules.  If an individual reads an English word they have never seen, they use the law of past experience to interpret the letters "L" and "I" as two letters beside each other, rather than using the law of closure to combine the letters and interpret the object as an uppercase U.&lt;ref name="todorvic"/&gt;

==Criticisms==

Some of the central criticisms of Gestaltism are based on the preference Gestaltists are deemed to have for theory over data, and a lack of quantitative research supporting Gestalt ideas. This is not necessarily a fair criticism as highlighted by a recent collection of quantitative research on Gestalt perception.&lt;ref name=Jakel2016&gt;{{citation| author=Jäkel, F., Singh, M., Wichmann, F. A., &amp; Herzog, M. H. | year=2016 | title=An overview of quantitative approaches in Gestalt perception. | journal=Vision Research | volume=126 | pages=3–8 | doi=10.1016/j.visres.2016.06.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other important criticisms concern the lack of definition and support for the many [[Physiology|physiological]] assumptions made by gestaltists&lt;ref name=Schultz2013&gt;{{cite book | last = Schultz | first = Duane | title = A History of Modern Psychology | publisher = Elsevier Science | location = Burlington | year = 2013 | page = 291 | isbn = 1483270084 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and lack of theoretical coherence in modern Gestalt psychology.&lt;ref name=Jakel2016/&gt;

In some scholarly communities, such as [[cognitive psychology]] and [[computational neuroscience]], gestalt theories of perception are criticized for being ''descriptive'' rather than ''explanatory'' in nature.  For this reason, they are viewed by some as redundant or uninformative. For example, [[Vicki Bruce|Bruce]], Green &amp; Georgeson&lt;ref name=BruceEtAl&gt;{{cite book |author=Bruce, V., Green, P. &amp; Georgeson, M. |title=Visual perception: Physiology, psychology and ecology |publisher=LEA |year=1996 | edition=3rd |page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude the following regarding gestalt theory's influence on the study of visual perception:
{{quote|text=The physiological theory of the gestaltists has fallen by the wayside, leaving us with a set of descriptive principles, but without a model of perceptual processing. Indeed, some of their "laws" of perceptual organisation today sound vague and inadequate. What is meant by a "good" or "simple" shape, for example? | author=Bruce, Green &amp; Georgeson | source=Visual perception: Physiology, psychology and ecology}}

==Gestalt views in psychology==
Gestalt psychologists find it is important to think of problems as a whole. Max Wertheimer considered thinking to happen in two ways: productive and reproductive.&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych2"&gt;Sternberg, Robert, Cognitive Psychology Fourth Edition, Thomas Wadsworth© 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Productive thinking''' is solving a problem with insight.

This is a quick insightful unplanned response to situations and environmental interaction.

'''Reproductive thinking''' is solving a problem with previous experiences and what is already known.  (1945/1959).

This is a very common thinking. For example, when a person is given several segments of information, he/she '''deliberately''' examines the relationships among its parts, analyzes their purpose, concept, and totality, he/she reaches the "aha!" moment, using what is already known. Understanding in this case happens '''intentionally''' by reproductive thinking.

Another gestalt psychologist, Perkins, believes insight deals with three processes:
# Unconscious leap in thinking.&lt;ref name="gestaltpsych"/&gt;
# The increased amount of speed in mental processing.
# The amount of short-circuiting that occurs in normal reasoning.&lt;ref name="gpsych"&gt;Langley&amp; associates, 1987; Perkins, 1981; Weisberg, 1986,1995"&lt;/ref&gt;

Views going against the gestalt psychology are:
# [[Insight phenomenology|Nothing-special view]]
# Neo-gestalt view
# [[The Three-Process View]]

Gestalt psychology should not be confused with the [[gestalt therapy]] of [[Fritz Perls]], which is only peripherally linked to gestalt psychology. A strictly gestalt psychology-based therapeutic method is [[Gestalt Theoretical Psychotherapy]], developed by the German gestalt psychologist and psychotherapist [[Hans-Jürgen Walter]] and his colleagues in Germany, Austria ([[Gerhard Stemberger]] and colleagues) and Switzerland. Other countries, especially Italy, have seen similar developments.

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
[[Fuzzy-trace theory]], a dual process model of memory and reasoning, was also derived from Gestalt psychology. Fuzzy-trace theory posits that we encode information into two separate traces: verbatim and gist. Information stored in verbatim is exact memory for detail (the individual parts of a pattern, for example) while information stored in gist is semantic and conceptual (what we perceive the pattern to be). The effects seen in Gestalt psychology can be attributed to the way we encode information as gist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reyna|first=Valerie|title=A new institutionism: Meaning, memory, and development in Fuzzy-Trace Theory|journal=Judgment and Decision Making|year=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=332–359 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barghout|first=Lauren|title=Visual Taxometric Approach to Image Segmentation Using Fuzzy-Spatial Taxon Cut Yields Contextually Relevant Regions|journal= Information Processing and Management of Uncertainty in Knowledge-Based Systems |year=2014|pages=163–173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in design==
The gestalt laws are used in [[user interface design]]. The laws of similarity and proximity can, for example, be used as guides for placing [[radio button]]s. They may also be used in designing computers and software for more intuitive human use. Examples include the design and layout of a desktop's shortcuts in rows and columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Soegaard |first=Mads |url=http://www.interaction-design.org/encyclopedia/gestalt_principles_of_form_perception.html |title=Gestalt principles of form perception |publisher=Interaction-design.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
An example of the Gestalt movement in effect, as it is both a process and result, is a music sequence. People are able to recognise a sequence of perhaps six or seven notes, despite them being transposed into a different tuning or key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Willis D.|title=A source book of Gestalt psychology|date=1999|publisher=Psychology Press|edition=Vol 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantum cognition modeling==
{{main|Quantum cognition#Gestalt perception}}

Similarities between Gestalt phenomena and [[quantum mechanics]] have been pointed out by, among others, chemist [[Anton Amann]], who commented that "similarities between Gestalt perception and quantum mechanics are on a level of a parable" yet may give useful insight nonetheless.&lt;ref&gt;Anton Amann, The Gestalt problem in quantum theory: Generation of molecular shape by the environment. ''Synthese'', October 1993, Volume 97, Issue 1, pp 125–156; Das Gestaltproblem in der Chemie: Die Entstehung molekularer Form unter dem Einfluß der Umgebung, ''Gestalt Theory, 1992, 14(4), 228-265.&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist Elio Conte and co-workers have proposed abstract, mathematical models to describe the time dynamics of [[Association (psychology)|cognitive associations]] with mathematical tools borrowed from [[quantum mechanics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conte | first1 = Elio | last2 = Todarello | first2 = Orlando | last3 = Federici | first3 = Antonio | last4 = Vitiello | first4 = Francesco | last5 = Lopane | first5 = Michele | last6 = Khrennikov | first6 = Andrei | last7 = Zbilut | first7 = Joseph P. | year = 2007 | title = Some remarks on an experiment suggesting quantum-like behavior of cognitive entities and formulation of an abstract quantum mechanical formalism to describe cognitive entity and its dynamics | url = | journal = Chaos, Solitons &amp; Fractals | volume = 31 | issue = 5| pages = 1076–1088 | doi = 10.1016/j.chaos.2005.09.061 |arxiv=0710.5092 | bibcode = 2007CSF....31.1076C }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elio Conte, Orlando Todarello, Antonio Federici, Francesco Vitiello, Michele Lopane, Andrei Khrennikov: A Preliminary Evidence of Quantum Like Behavior in Measurements of Mental States, [https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0307201 arXiv:quant-ph/0307201] (submitted 28 July 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and has discussed psychology experiments in this context. A similar approach has been suggested by physicists [[David Bohm]], [[Basil Hiley]] and philosopher [[Paavo Pylkkänen]] with the notion that [[Thought#The mind-body problem|mind and matter]] both emerge from [[Implicate and explicate order#A common grounding for consciousness and matter|an "implicate order"]].&lt;ref&gt;B.J. Hiley: ''Particles, fields, and observers'', Volume I The Origins of Life, Part 1 Origin and Evolution of Life, Section II The Physical and Chemical Basis of Life, pp. 87–106 ([http://www.bbk.ac.uk/tpru/BasilHiley/Frontiersoflife.pdf PDF])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Basil J. Hiley, Paavo Pylkkänen: ''Naturalizing the mind in a quantum framework''. In Paavo Pylkkänen and Tere Vadén (eds.): Dimensions of conscious experience, Advances in Consciousness Research, Volume 37, John Benjamins B.V., 2001, {{ISBN|90-272-5157-6}}, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=CCX1NhhpQNQC&amp;pg=PA119 pages 119-144]&lt;/ref&gt; The models involve non-[[commutative property|commutative]] mathematics; such models account for situations in which the outcome of two measurements performed one after the other can depend on the order in which they are performed—a pertinent feature for psychological processes, as an experiment performed on a conscious person may influence the outcome of a subsequent experiment by changing the state of mind of that person.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">{{short description|portrait by Japanese artist Hokusai}}{{italic title}}

The '''''Great Daruma''''' was a monumental portrait created by Japanese artist [[Hokusai]] on 5 October 1817. Also known as the '''''Great Bodhidarma''''', the work is a depiction of [[Bodhidharma]], known in Japan as [[Bodhidharma|Daruma]], a revered [[Buddhist monk]] of the 5th or 6th century. The original artwork was destroyed in May 1945.

== Background ==
The ''Great Daruma'' was not Hokusai's first monumental portrait. In 1804, during a festival at the [[Gokoku-ji]] temple in Edo (modern [[Tokyo]]), he created a portrait of Daruma said to be {{convert|600|ft}} long, using a broom and buckets full of ink.

== Conception ==
[[File:Hokusai Daruma 1817.png|thumb|Contemporary print of [[Hokusai]] painting the ''Great Daruma'' in 1817]]
Hokusai made the ''Great Daruma'' in a courtyard beside the [[Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin]] Buddhist temple in [[Nagoya]], Japan. The portrait depicted the head of the monk and his upper body swathed in flowing robes. It was drawn on a large expanse of paper, measuring {{convert|59|x|35|ft|m}}, equivalent to approximately 120 standard [[tatami]] mats of {{convert|70|x|35|in|cm}} each. The eyes were {{convert|70|in|cm}} wide, the nose {{convert|105|in|cm}} long, and the mouth {{convert|82|in|cm}} across. 

The event was advertised in advance to draw a large crowd. Hokusai worked for hours adding bold lines of ink until the image was finally revealed when the paper was hoisted into the air using a large wooden beam attached to one end, like a gigantic [[hanging scroll]], or the huge [[thongdrel]] [[thanka]]s of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] (usually in silk appliqué).

== Reception ==
As a result of this dramatic feat, Hokusai became known in Nagoya as "Daruma-sen", the Daruma master. The triumph brought greater attention to Hokusai, enabling him to sell more prints to the public, including prints of the ''Great Daruma''. He published a new volume of his [[Manga]] sketches in 1817.

== Destruction ==
The original artwork survived in Nagoya until May 1945, when it was destroyed along with the wooden temple building in the [[bombing of Nagoya in World War II]]. Contemporaneous promotional handbills survive, with some held at the [[Nagoya City Museum]].

'''Historical astronomy''' is the science of analysing historic [[astronomy|astronomical]] data. The [[American Astronomical Society]] (AAS), established 1899, states that its Historical Astronomy Division "...shall exist for the purpose of advancing interest in topics relating to the historical nature of astronomy. By historical astronomy we include the [[history of astronomy]]; what has come to be known as [[archaeoastronomy]]; and the application of historical records to modern [[Astrophysics|astrophysical]] problems." [https://web.archive.org/web/20060206232209/http://www.aas.org/had/hadhist.html] Historical and ancient observations are used to track theoretically long term trends, such as eclipse patterns and the velocity of nebular clouds. [https://web.archive.org/web/20011019220913/http://star-www.dur.ac.uk/~jms/group.html] Conversely, utilizing known and well documented phenomenological activity, historical astronomers apply computer models to verify the validity of ancient observations, as well as [[Astronomical chronology|dating]] such observations and documents which would otherwise be unknown.

== Examples ==
* One example of such study would be the [[Crab Nebula]], which is the remains of a [[supernova]] of July 1054, the [[SN 1054]]. During the Northern [[Song dynasty]] in China, a historical [[Chinese astronomy|astronomical record]] was written, which lists unusual phenomena observed in the night sky. The event was also recorded by Japanese and [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Arab astronomers]]. Scholars often associate this with the formation of the Crab Nebula. [3]
* Secondly, The [[astronomer]] [[Edmond Halley]] employed this science to deduce that three [[comet]]s that appeared roughly 76 years apart were in fact the [[Comet Halley|same object]].
* Similarly, the [[dwarf planet]] [[Pluto]] was found to have been photographed as early as 1915 although it was not recognized until 1930.
* [[Quasar]]s have been photographed since the late 19th centuries although they were not known to be unusual objects until the 1960s.

René of Anjou's contemporary [[Louis de Gruuthuse]] himself was a famous competitor in tournaments during the 1440s.&lt;/ref&gt; The two dukes can be seen facing each other in the center of the front lines, each with a personal heraldic flag as well with a larger flag of the same design representing their team.
The chief [[herald]] is also on horseback, between the two teams, wearing his own heraldic colours.]]

'''[[Heraldry]]''' is the system of visual identification of rank and [[genealogy|pedigree]] which developed 
in the European [[High Middle Ages]],&lt;ref name="CGH 1–18"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; closely associated with the [[Royal court|courtly]] culture of [[chivalry]], 
[[Latin Church|Latin Christianity]], the [[Crusades]], [[feudalism|feudal]] [[nobility|aristocracy]], and [[Monarchies in Europe|monarchy]] of the time. 
Heraldic tradition fully developed in the 13th century, and it flourished and developed further during the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]].
Originally limited to nobility, heraldry is adopted by wealthy commoners in the Late Middle Ages ([[Burgher arms]]). 
Specific traditions of [[Ecclesiastical heraldry]] also develop in the late medieval period. 
Coats of arms of noble families, often after their extinction, becomes attached to the territories they used to own, giving rise to [[municipal coats of arms]] by the 16th century.

Western heraldry spread beyond its core territory of Latin Christendom in the 17th century, Western heraldic traditions being adopted in the [[Russian Empire]].

With the decline of European monarchies in favour of [[Republicanism]] in the 19th to 20th centuries, heraldic tradition declined in importance, but modern [[national flag]]s and [[national emblem]]s adopted in the 19th and 20th century still frequently use elements inherited from heraldic tradition.

[[File:Harold dead bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|Depiction of [[kite shield]]s with cross or spiral ornaments in the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (c. 1070).]]
Traditions of [[field sign]]s, personal [[emblem]]s or [[Seal (emblem)|seals]] go back to at least the [[Ancient Near East|Bronze Age]].
The [[Ekphrasis|ekphrastic]] description of [[shield]] designs in particular is found as a topos in classical literature.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 6–10.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Units of the Roman army were sometimes identified by distinctive markings on their shields.&lt;ref&gt;''Notitia Dignitatum'', Bodleian Library&lt;/ref&gt;

Heraldry developed in the [[high medieval period]], based on earlier, "pre-heraldic" or "ante-heraldic", traditions of visual identification by means of  [[Seal (emblem)|seal]]s,  [[field sign]]s, emblems used on [[numismatics|coins]], etc. Notably, [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] that would subsequently appear in 12th-century coats of arms of European nobility have pre-figurations in the [[animal style]] of ancient art (specifically  the style of [[Scythian art]] as it developed from c. the 7th century BC).&lt;ref&gt;"significant pre-figuration of medieval heraldry"  John Onians, ''Atlas of World Art'' (2004), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=O3h2KfXoOPYC&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Western heraldry is an innovation of the 12th century. Certain members of the high nobility began to display animals, 
specifically [[lion (heraldry)|lions]] on their shields beginning in c. the 1140s. 
Prior to this, western military shields of the 11th to early 12th century did sometimes show simple decorations, but not apparently tied to the personal identification of the bearer.

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]], illustrating the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman invasion]] of England in 1066, and probably commissioned about 1077, when the cathedral of Bayeux was rebuilt, depicts a number of shields of various shapes and designs, many of which are plain, while others are decorated with dragons, crosses, or other typically heraldic figures.  Yet no individual is depicted twice bearing the same arms, nor are any of the descendants of the various persons depicted known to have borne devices resembling those in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;John Woodward and George Burnett, ''A Treatise on Heraldry: British and Foreign'', W. &amp; A. K. Johnson, Edinburgh and London (1892), vol. 1, pp. 29–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Frankish or German [[round shield]]s of the 11th century ([[Ottonian]], [[Salian dynasty|Salian]]) are sometimes depicted with simple geometric ornamentation, but not with figurative emblems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vikingage.org/wiki/wiki/Round_Shield_Designs Round Shield Designs (vikingage.org)]: "chequered" (11th c., Biblio. Mun. Avranches MS50), "flared cross" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), 
"spirals" (c.1000-1050 Arras, BM MS 559 (435), vol. 1), "spirals with dots" (c.1000-1020 Bamberg MS A. II. 42 Bamberg Apocalypse).&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, an account of the French knights at the court of the Byzantine emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexius I]] at the beginning of the twelfth century describes their shields of polished metal, utterly devoid of heraldic design.  A Spanish manuscript from 1109 describes both plain and decorated shields, none of which appears to have been heraldic.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey of St. Denis]] contained a window commemorating the knights who embarked on the [[Second Crusade]] in 1147, and was probably made soon after the event; but [[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon's]] illustration of the window before it was destroyed shows no heraldic design on any of the shields.&lt;ref name="CGH 14–16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proto-heraldry (12th century)==
{{seealso|List of oldest heraldry|Equestrian seal}}
[[File:Thibaut Blois.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of the [[equestrian seal]] of [[Theobald III, Count of Blois]], dated 1138. Traces of an ornamental cross design are visible on the shield.]]
The 12th-century tradition is mostly preserved in the form of the [[equestrian seal]]s popular at the time which show the nobleman as a fully armed warrior on horseback. Early equestrian seals show plain shields. From the mid 12th century, proto-heraldic designs are sometimes shown, but the shield is shown naturally, as part of the knight's armament, and is often seen in profile or partially obscured. 
The [[:File:Demay p6.jpg|equestrian seal]] of Enguerrand (Ingelram), [[count of Saint-Pol]] (1130s or 1140s) still shows a plain shield, but what would later become [[heraldic charge]]s (in this case, sheaves of corn) are shown arranged around the horse.&lt;ref&gt;"le blason fait son apparition dans les dernières années du XIIe siècle, brusquement, sans transition. Mais il est d’autres types plus anciens où les pièces des armoiries existent, s’annonçant pour ainsi dire avant de passer dans l’écu. Le sceau d’Enguerran, comte de Saint-Pol, antérieur à l’année 1150, est de ce nombre. Il offre déjà plusieurs ''gerbes'' dispersées dans le champ." 
G. Demay, ''Le Blason d’après les sceaux du Moyen-Âge'' (1877), [https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Demay_-_Le_Blason_d’après_les_sceaux_du_Moyen-Âge,_1877.djvu/7 p. 6].&lt;/ref&gt;
Seals displaying actual heraldic shields appear by the very end of the 12th century or the early years of the 13th century.

Seals with elements of a distinctly heraldic character begin to appear in the second third of the 12th century.
A number of seals dating from between 1135 and 1155 appear to show the adoption of heraldic devices in England, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Woodcock (officer of arms)|Thomas Woodcock]] &amp; [[John Martin Robinson]], ''The Oxford Guide to Heraldry'', Oxford University Press, New York (1988), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  
A notable example of an early armorial seal is attached to a charter granted by [[Philip I, Count of Flanders]], in 1164.  Seals from the latter part of the eleventh and early twelfth centuries show no evidence of heraldic symbolism, but by the end of the twelfth century, seals are uniformly heraldic in nature.&lt;ref name="ToH 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, ''Heraldry in England'', p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the oldest equestrial seals with armorials are those of [[Henry the Lion]] of the [[House of Welf]], duke of Saxony (1142&amp;ndash;1180) and Bavaria (1156&amp;ndash;1180). A total of seven seals of Henry's are known. Of these, only the second shows a recognizable [[heraldic lion|lion]] displayed on his shield. This seal is attached to two documents dated to 1146. It is possible that the lion was also on the first seal (c. 1142), but it is no longer recognizable.&lt;ref&gt;Xenja von Ertzdorff, Rudolf Schulz, Winfried Baumann, ''Die Romane von dem Ritter mit dem Löwen'' (1994), p. 175,
citing Schmidt-Phiseldeck, '' Die Siegel des herzoglichen Hauses Braunschweig und Lüneburg'', nr. 1&amp;ndash;4.&lt;/ref&gt;
An equestrian seal of similar antiquity is [[:File:Ottokar III of Styria 1160.jpg|that]] of [[Ottokar III of Styria]], dated 1160, with an early form of the [[Styria]]n [[Panther (legendary creature)|panther]] on his shield.

[[File:Geoffrey of Anjou Monument.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|Enamel from the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], showing his shield in profile, with four out of what were presumably six lions visible (six lions are on the shield of the effigy of  his grandson  [[William Longespée, 3rd Earl of Salisbury|William Longespée]], d. 1226).]]
The oldest extant depiction of a coloured armoury can be seen on the tomb of [[Geoffrey Plantagenet, Count of Anjou]], who died in 1151.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;  An enamel, probably commissioned by Geoffrey's widow between 1155 and 1160, depicts him carrying a blue shield decorated with six golden lions rampant.  He wears a blue helmet adorned with another lion, and his cloak is lined in vair.  A medieval chronicle states that Geoffrey was given a shield of this description when he was knighted by his father-in-law, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in 1128; but this account probably dates to about 1175.&lt;ref&gt;C. A. Stothard, ''Monumental Effigies of Great Britain'' (1817) pl. 2, illus. in Anthony Wagner, Richmond Herald, ''Heraldry in England'', Penguin (1946), pl. I.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Pastoureau]], ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/Discoveries_Heraldry.html?id=hmZ5QgAACAAJ Heraldry: An Introduction to a Noble Tradition]'', "[[Abrams Discoveries]]" series. Harry N. Abrams, Inc. (1997), {{p.|18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The earliest evidence of the association of lions with the English crown is a seal bearing two lions passant, used by the future [[John, King of England|King John]] during the lifetime of his father, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]], who died in 1189.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 173–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  
Since Henry was the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet, it seems reasonable to suppose that the adoption of lions as an heraldic emblem by Henry or his sons might have been inspired by Geoffrey's shield.  John's elder brother, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]], who succeeded his father on the throne, is believed to have been the first to have borne the arms of three lions passant-guardant, still the arms of England, having earlier used two lions rampant combatant, which arms may also have belonged to his father.&lt;ref&gt;Pastoureau, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;  Richard is also credited with having originated the English crest of a lion statant (now statant-guardant).&lt;ref name="CGH 173–174"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early mention of heraldic shields in [[Middle High German literature]] also dates to the 12th century.
Shield designs are described in the  ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'' (c. 1150&amp;ndash;1170), such as the boar carried by the Romans, as well as, in isolated cases, in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'' (c. 1115), ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'' (c. 1150), [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']] (c. 1170), and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']] (c. 1185).
These appear in the larger context of describing an armed protagonist, and are not yet tied to the bearer's pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;"With the exception of several heraldic shields that appear in the ''[[Kaiserchronik]]'', such as the boar carried by the Romans&amp;mdash;the oldest heraldic insignia in medieval German epic literature, according to Zips [''Wappenwesen'', 1966]&amp;mdash;most of the precourtly and even courtly epics up to 1200 contain very few decorated shields at all. Several isolated coats of arms are mentioned in the German ''[[The Song of Roland|Rolandslied]]'', ''[[King Rother|König Rother]]'', [[Heinrich von Veldeke|Veldecke's ''Eneas'']], and [[Erec (poem)|Hartmann's ''Erec'']]&amp;mdash;mostly related to the protagonists." Wandhoff (2016),  ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=5mYYDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57 p. 57]).&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[heraldic cross|cross symbol]] worn on the shield and surcoat at this time is not a heraldic charge identifying the bearer but a [[field sign]] worn by all participants in the Crusade.]]
At least two distinctive features of heraldry are generally accepted as products of the [[Crusades]]: the surcoat, an outer garment worn over the armor to protect the wearer from the heat of the sun, was often decorated with the same devices that appeared on a knight's shield.  It is from this garment that the phrase "coat of arms" is derived.{{dubious|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--the term is from the 14th century, and has no direct relation to the crusades at all--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also the lambrequin, or mantling, that depends from the helmet and frames the shield in modern heraldry, began as a practical covering for the helmet and the back of the neck during the Crusades,{{cn|date=November 2018}}&lt;!--do you mean the period of the crusades (i.e. the 12th century), or the actual campaign? If the latter, what is the evidence?--&gt;
serving much the same function as the surcoat.  Its slashed or scalloped edge, today rendered as billowing flourishes, is thought to have originated from hard wearing in the field, or as a means of deadening a sword blow and perhaps entangling the attacker's weapon.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 17–18, 383.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval heraldry==
{{see|Roll of arms}}
[[File:DeringRoll.jpg|thumb|200px|''Dering Roll'', c. 1270, Dover, one of the oldest extant [[Roll of arms|rolls of arms]], showing the coats of arms as yet without [[helmet (heraldry)|helmets]] or any other achievements.]]

===Terminology===
{{see|Blazon}}
The origin of the term ''[[:wikt:heraldry|heraldry]]'' itself ([[Middle English]] ''heraldy'', [[Old French]] ''hiraudie''), can be placed in the context of the early forms of the [[Tournament (medieval)|knightly tournament]]s in the 12th century. Combattants wore full armour, and identified themselves by wearing their emblems on their [[heater shield|shields]]. A [[herald]] (Old French ''heraut'', from a [[Frankish language|Frankish]] ''*hariwald'' "commander of an army") was an officer who would announce the competitors. 

Originally a type of messenger employed by noblemen, heralds assumed the responsibility of learning and knowing the rank, pedigree, and heraldic devices of various knights and lords, as well as the rules and protocols governing the design and description, or ''blazoning'' of arms, and the precedence of their bearers.&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 27–29.&lt;/ref&gt;  As early as the late thirteenth century, certain heralds in the employ of monarchs were given the title "King of Heralds", which eventually became "[[King of Arms]]."&lt;ref name="CGH 27–29"/&gt;

The term ''[[coat of arms]]''  in origin refers to the [[surcoat]] with heraldic designs worn by combattants, especially in the knightly tournament, in Old French ''cote a armer''. The sense is transferred to the heraldic design itself in Middle English, in the mid-14th century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.etymonline.com/word/coat%20of%20arms#etymonline_v_28240 etymonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heraldic shield===
{{see|Escutcheon (heraldry)}}
By about the 1230s, the shields used by cavalry were almost triangular in shape, referred to as [[heater shield]]s. Such a 
shield is preserved, the shield of [[Konrad von Thüringen]], dated c. 1230, showing the ''lion barry'' of the [[Ludovingians]].
This heater-shaped form was used in warfare during the apogee of the [[Chivalry|Age of Chivalry]], and it becomes the classic heraldic shield, or [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]], at about the time of the [[Battle of Crecy]] (1346) and the founding of the [[Order of the Garter]] (1348), when heraldry had become a fully developed system.
All medieval [[roll of arms|rolls of arms]], from the late 13th and throughout the 14th to 15th century, almost exclusively use this shield shape. 

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Division of the field===
{{see|Division of the field}}
Coats of arms of the 13th century in some cases already include marks of [[cadency]] to distinguish descendants, but they mostly still do without [[division of the field]] to indicate descent from more than one lineage. 
An exception is the [[coat of arms of Castile and León]], showing
the [[Heraldry of Castile|arms of Castile]] (the yellow castle) [[Quartering (heraldry)|quartered]] with the [[Heraldry of León|arms of León]] (the purple lion) in the late 13th century ''[[Camden Roll]]'' and  ''Segar's Roll''.
This practice becomes much more common in the late medieval period. For example, the  arms of [[Eric of Pomerania]] as king of the [[Kalmar Union]] (r. 1396–1439) combine five coats of arms, for Denmark, Sweden, the [[House of Bjelbo]], Pomerania and Norway, quartered by a cross gules and with a central [[inescutcheon]].
In the later 15th century, holders of ecclesiastical office would quarter their family arms with those of the 
order or diocese they represented. Thus [[Pierre d'Aubusson]] as grand master of the [[Knights of Malta]] quartered his family arms with the [[Maltese cross]]; bishop [[Hugo von Hohenlandenberg]] quartered his family arms with those of the [[bishopric of Constance|prince-bishopric of Constance]].

===Heraldic authorities===
{{see|Heraldic authority}}
By the middle of the fourteenth century, the principle that only a single individual was entitled to bear a particular coat of arms was generally accepted, and disputes over the ownership of arms seems to have led to gradual establishment of heraldic authorities to regulate their use.  The earliest known work of [[Law of Arms|heraldic jurisprudence]], ''De Insigniis et Armis'', was written about 1350 by [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]], a professor of law at the [[University of Padua]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/bartolo.htm ''De Insigniis et Armis'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Squibb, "The Law of Arms in England", in ''The Coat of Arms'' vol. II, no. 15 (Spring 1953), p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  
The most celebrated armorial dispute in English heraldry is that of ''[[Scrope v Grosvenor]]'' (1390), in which two different men claimed the right to bear ''azure, a bend or''.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continued proliferation of arms, and the number of disputes arising from different men assuming the same arms, led [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] to issue a proclamation in 1419, forbidding all those who had not borne arms at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] from assuming arms, except by inheritance or a grant from the crown.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Woodward and Burnett, vol. 1, pp. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Siebmacher002.jpg|thumb|upright|Royal coats of arms in ''[[Siebmachers Wappenbuch]]'' (1605)]]
In 1484, during the reign of [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], the various heralds employed by the crown were incorporated into the [[College of Arms]], through which all new grants of arms would eventually be issued.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"&gt;Pastoureau, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt;  The college currently consists of three Kings of Arms, assisted by six Heralds, and four [[Pursuivants]], or junior officers of arms, all under the authority of the [[Earl Marshal]]; but all of the arms granted by the college are graÅnted by the authority of the crown.&lt;ref name="CoA Official Site"&gt;[http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/about-us/heralds-officers College of Arms official website], accessed 3 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar bodies regulate the granting of arms in other monarchies and several members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], but in most other countries there is no heraldic authority, and no law preventing anyone from assuming whatever arms they please, provided that they do not infringe upon the arms of another.&lt;ref name="Pastoureau 39–41"/&gt;

Beginning in the reign of [[Henry VIII]], the Kings of Arms were commanded to make ''[[heraldic visitation|visitations]]'', in which they traveled about the country, recording arms borne under proper authority, and requiring those who bore arms without authority either to obtain authority for them, or cease their use.  Arms borne improperly were to be taken down and defaced.  The first such visitation began in 1530, and the last was carried out in 1700, although no new commissions to carry out visitations were made after the accession of [[William III of England|William III]] in 1689.&lt;ref name="CGH 21–22"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Franklyn, ''Shield and Crest: An Account of the Art and Science of Heraldry'', MacGibbon &amp; Kee, London (1960), p. 386.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[early modern period]], heraldry became highly complex and standardised, divided into "national"  traditions. 
Western heraldry can be divided into three large cultural groups, "Gallo-British", "German-Nordic" and "Latin".
Part of the Gallo-British group are [[French heraldry|French]], 
[[English heraldry|English]] and [[Scottish heraldry|Scottish]] traditions. The "German-Nordic" group includes the tradition of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] and its greater sphere of incluence, including 
[[German heraldry]], [[Swedish heraldry]], [[Norwegian heraldry]], [[Danish heraldry]], [[Russian heraldry]],  [[Polish heraldry]], [[Hungarian heraldry]], [[Croatian heraldry]], [[Serbian heraldry]], etc.

The "Latin" group includes [[Italian heraldry]], [[Spanish heraldry]] and [[Portuguese heraldry]].

[[Dutch heraldry]] shows influence of all three groups.

Prominent burghers and corporations, including many cities and towns, assumed or obtained grants of arms, with only nominal military associations.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Gwynn-Jones, ''The Art of Heraldry: Origins, Symbols, and Designs'', Parkgate Books/Barnes &amp; Noble (1998), pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Heraldic devices were depicted in various contexts, such as religious and funerary art, and in using a wide variety of media, including stonework, carved wood, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]], [[stained glass]], and [[embroidery]].&lt;ref&gt;Ottfried Neubecker, ''Heraldry: Sources, Symbols and Meaning'', Macdonald and James Publishers (1977), pp. 253–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the abandonment of the [[joust]] as courtly practice at the beginning of the 17th century,  heraldic achievements, especially the [[helmet (heraldry)|heraldry]], ceased to be tied to the technological development or fashion of [[jousting armour]] and shapes of helmets became purely conventional, and in the various regional systems, separate types of helmets came to be tied to separate ranks of nobility.

[[Baroque]] heraldic designs became increasingly elaborate, both in terms of the increasingly complex [[division of the field]] and in terms of the surrounding achievements, culminating in the development of "landscape heraldry", incorporating realistic depictions of landscapes, during the latter part of the eighteenth and early part of the nineteenth century.

In the mid-19th century, there was  a renewed interest in the history of armory,
but now mostly from an [[antiquarian]]'s or [[genealogy|genealogist]]'s perspective. This led to a re-evaluation of older designs over Baroque and Roccoco styles, a new appreciation for the medieval origins of the art.&lt;ref&gt;Fox-Davies, ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', pp. 87–88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since the late nineteenth century, heraldry has focused on the use of varied lines of partition and little-used ordinaries to produce new and unique designs.&lt;ref&gt;Gwynn-Jones, pp. 113–121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "heraldry" is sometimes used to include the [[national emblem]]s of modern states. Some modern states, especially constitutional monarchies, use national coats of arms (such as the [[coat of arms of Denmark]] or the [[coat of arms of Spain]]).
States with republican tradition tend to avoid coats of arms, using "national seals" or "national emblems" instead, such as the [[national emblem of France]], the [[national emblem of Turkey]] or the [[Great Seal of the United States]].

The '''Institute for Experimental Mathematics (IEM)''' was founded, with the support of the [[Volkswagen]]
Foundation, as a central scientific facility of the former University of Essen, now [[University of Duisburg-Essen]] in 1989.  With the addition of the [[Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach]] Foundation Chair on 1 January 1999, the Institute was expanded in the area of Computer Networking Technology. [[A.J. Han Vinck]] is currently the Institute's managing director.

The primary objective of the Institute is to foster interactions between the fields of mathematics, computer science and the engineering sciences. Mathematicians, computer experts and telecommunications engineers are engaged in trans-disciplinary collaboration under one roof. The main areas of research are [[discrete mathematics]], [[number theory]], [[data transmission|digital communication]], and [[computer network|computer networking technology]].

'''Juhani Uolevi Pallasmaa''' (born 14 September 1936 in [[Hämeenlinna]], Finland) is a [[Finnish people|Finnish]] architect and former professor of architecture and dean at the [[Helsinki University of Technology]]. Among the many academic and civic positions he has held are those of Director of the Museum of Finnish Architecture 1978-1983, and head of the Institute of Industrial Arts, [[Helsinki]]. He established his own architect's office – Arkkitehtitoimisto Juhani Pallasmaa KY – in 1983 in Helsinki. From 2001 to 2003, he was  Raymond E. Maritz Visiting Professor of Architecture at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], and in 2013 he received an honorary doctorate from that university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://samfoxschool.wustl.edu/news/8941 Honorary WUSTL Degrees for 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010-2011, Pallasmaa served as Plym Distinguished Professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/juhani-pallasmaa-plym-distinguished-professor-in-architecture-2010-2011/oclc/810280328 WorldCat record for "Juhani Pallasmaa: Plym distinguished professor in architecture 2010-2011"]&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2012-2013 he was scholar in residence at [[Frank Lloyd Wright|Frank Lloyd Wright's]] [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taliesin.edu/faculty.html Taliesin Faculty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101071306/http://www.taliesin.edu/faculty.html |date= 1 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pallasmaa has also lectured widely in Europe, North and South America, Africa and Asia.

His exhibitions of Finnish architecture, planning and visual arts have been displayed in more than thirty countries and he has written numerous articles on cultural philosophy, [[environmental psychology]] and theories of architecture and the arts. Many of his articles are first featured in ''ARK'' (''The Finnish Architectural Review'').

Among Pallasmaa's many books on architectural theory is ''The Eyes of the Skin – Architecture and the Senses'', a book that has become a classic of architectural theory and is required reading on courses in many schools of architecture around the world.

A selection of essays written by Pallasmaa, from the early years to more recent ones, has been translated into English and collated together in the book ''Encounters – Architectural Essays'' (Helsinki, 2005), edited by Peter MacKeith. The book was shortlisted for the [[RIBA]] 2005 International Book Award.

In 2006 Pallasmaa turned 70, and the occasion was marked by the publication of the book ''Archipelago. Essays on Architecture'', edited by Peter MacKeith. The collection contains essays by 23 authors, all with some connection to Pallasmaa or MacKeith. They include: Karsten Harries, [[Daniel Hoffman|Dan Hoffman]], [[Steven Holl]], [[Colin St. John Wilson]] and [[Daniel Libeskind]].

Pallasmaa is a member of the [[Finnish Association of Architects]], and an honorary [[Fellow of the American Institute of Architects|Fellow]] of the [[American Institute of Architects]].  During the spring of 2010, Pallasmaa, along with American playwright Leigh Fondakowski, was an Imagine Fund Distinguished Visiting Chair at the [[Institute for Advanced Study at University of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20121210122720/http://ias.umn.edu/2010/04/05/imagine-fund-chairs-april-2010/ Imagine Fund Chairs]&lt;/ref&gt; Pallasmaa was jury member for the 2014 [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pritzkerprize.com/about/jury-bios Pritzker Architecture Prize 2014 Jury Members]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architectural career==

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Moduli 225, model industrial summer house, 1969-1971.jpg|thumb|200px|Moduli 225 industrially-produced summer house (with Kristian Gullichsen), 1969-71.]] --&gt;
In terms of architectural production, the work Juhani Pallasmaa has undergone a shift during his career. His early career is characterised by concerns with rationalism, standardization and prefabrication. This was partly due to the influence of his mentor Professor Aulis Blomstedt, who was very much concerned with proportional systems and standardization. Pallasmaa's first key work demonstrating these principles was the Moduli 225 (with [[Kristian Gullichsen]]), an industrial-produced summer house, 1969-1971, of which around six were built in Finland. However, the key models for this type of architecture were both Japanese architecture and the refined abstractions of [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]. In Finland this type of architecture is referred to as "constructivism" - with only a family resemblance to the avant-gardist [[Constructivism (art)|Russian Constructivism]] - and at that time, the late 1950s and 1960s, stood in opposition to the work of [[Alvar Aalto]], who was increasingly seen in his home country as an idiosyncratic individualist. But the interest in Japan also contained the seeds for Pallasmaa's later concerns; materiality and a phenomenology of experience. It was after returning from teaching in Africa that Pallasmaa turned away from pure constructivism, and took up his concerns with psychology, culture, and [[Phenomenology (architecture)|phenomenology]]. His concern for details and small works such as exhibition design has sometimes earned him the label "jewel-box architect". 2006 saw the completion of his largest ever work, the [[Kamppi Center]], incorporating the main  bus station, a shopping centre and housing in central Helsinki, though the work was split up into different sections involving various architects, and overall design was under the control of architects Helin &amp; Co.

The '''legal history of the [[Catholic Church]]''' is the history of the oldest continuously functioning legal system in the West,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dr. Edward N. Peters]], [http://www.canonlaw.info CanonLaw.info], accessed Jul-1-2013&lt;/ref&gt; much later than [[Roman law]] but predating the evolution of modern European [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] traditions. The history of Latin [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]] can be divided into four periods: the ''jus antiquum'', the ''jus novum'', the ''jus novissimum'' and the ''Code of Canon Law''.&lt;ref name=Manual13&gt;Manual of Canon Law, pg. 13, #8&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the Code, history can be divided into the ''jus vetus'' (all law before the Code) and the ''jus novum'' (the law of the Code, or ''jus codicis'').&lt;ref name=Manual13/&gt; Eastern canon law developed separately.

==Latin canon law==
=== ''Jus Antiquum'' ===
{{main|Collections of ancient canons}}
The most ancient collections of canonical legislation are certain very early Apostolic documents, known as the [[Ancient Church Orders|Church Orders]]: for instance, the ''[[Didache]] ton dodeka apostolon'' or "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles", which dates from the end of the first or the beginning of the 2nd century; the [[Apostolic Church-Ordinance]]; the ''[[Didascalia]]'', or "Teaching of the Apostles"; the [[Apostolic Canons]] and [[Apostolic Constitutions]]. These collections have never had any official value, no more than any other collection of this first period. However, the Apostolic Canons and, through it, the Apostolic Constitutions, were influential for a time in that later collections would draw upon these earliest sources of Church law.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Fournier and Gabriel Le Bras, ''Histoire des Collections Canoniques en Occident depuis les Fausses Décrétales jusqu’au Décret de Gratien'', 2 vols. (Paris, 1931), vol I, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;
 
It was in the East, after Constantine I's [[Edict of Milan]] of toleration (313), that arose the first systematic collections. We cannot so designate the chronological collections of the canons of the councils of the 4th and 5th centuries (314-451); the oldest systematic collection, made by an unknown author in 535, has not come down. The most important collections of this epoch are the ''Synagoge kanonon'', or the collection of [[John the Scholastic]] (Joannes Scholasticus), compiled at [[Antioch]] about 550, and the [[Nomocanons]], or compilations of civil laws affecting religious matters (''nomos'') and ecclesiastical laws (''kanon''). One such mixed collection is dated in the 6th century and has been erroneously attributed to John the Scholastic; another of the 7th century was rewritten and much enlarged by the schismatical ecumenical patriarch [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]] (883).
 
In the Western Church one collection of canons, the ''Collectio Dionysiana'', exercised an influence far beyond the limits of the country in which it was composed. This collection was the work of [[Dionysius Exiguus]], who compiled several collections that now go under the name ''Dionysiana''. Dionysius appears to have done most of his work shortly after the year 600.&lt;ref&gt;On the controversial date of the Dionysian collections, see E. Wirbelauer, ed., ''Zwei Päpste in Rom: der Konflikt zwischen Laurentius und Symmachus (498–514)'', Studien und Texte, Quellen und Forschungen zur antiken Welt 16 (Munich, 1993), p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; His collections contain his own Latin translation of the canons of the ancient third-, fourth- and fifth-century councils, excerpts from a (probably) confected collection of African canons (which Dionysius calls the ''Registrum ecclesiae Carthaginensis'', c.f. [[Church of Carthage]]), and a collection of (38) papal letters (''Epistolæ decretales'') dating from the reign of [[Pope Siricius]] (384-398) to that of [[Pope Anastasius II|Anastasius II]] (died 498). The influence of this Italian collection grew enormously during the seventh and eighth centuries, especially in England and France. It was continuously enlarged and modified, the most famous modification being a version supposedly send by Pope [[Adrian I]] to [[Charlemagne]] in 774 and therefore known today as the ''[[Collectio Dionysio-Hadriana]]''.

Besides the ''Dionysiana'' Italy also produced two 5th-century Latin translations of the Greek synods known as the '' Corpus canonum Africano-Romanum'' and ''Collectio prisca'', both of which are now lost though large portions of them survive in two very large Italian collections known as the ''[[Collectio canonum Quesnelliana]]'' and ''[[Collectio canonum Sanblasiana]]'' respectively. In Italy was also produced a popular fifth-century collection of forgeries known today as the ''[[Symmachean forgeries]]''. Africa possessed a late fourth-century collection known as the ''Breviarium Hipponense'' as well as an early fifth-century collection known as the ''Codex Apiarii causae''; also the ''Breviatio canonum'', or digest of the canons of the councils by [[Fulgentius Ferrandus]] (died c. 546), and the ''Concordia canonum'' of [[Cresconius Africanus]], an adaptation of the ''Dionysiana'' (about 690). In Gaul many important collections were produced, like the collection known today as the ''Concilium Arelatense secundum'' and, at the beginning of the 6th century, the ''Statuta Ecclesiæ antiqua'', erroneously attributed to Africa. Also from Gaul/France are the collections known today as the ''[[Collectio canonum quadripartita]]'' and the ''Libri duo de synodalibus causis'' composed by [[Regino of Prüm]]. Gaul/France also produced two immensely important collections known as the ''[[Collectio canonum vetus Gallica]]'' (compiled in Lyons about 600) and the ''[[Collectio canonum Dacheriana]]'' (about 800), the latter so called from the name of its editor, Luc d'Achéry. The ''Collectio canonum Hibernensis'' or Irish collection of canons, compiled in the 8th century, influenced both [[England]], [[Gaul]] and (though much later) Italy.&lt;ref&gt;David N. Dumville, "Ireland, Brittany and England: Transmission and Use of the ''Collectio canonum Hibernensis''", in Catherine Laurent and Helen Davis (eds.), ''Irlande et Bretagne : vingt siècles d'histoire'', Actes du colloque de Rennes, 29-31 mars 1993 (Rennes, 1994), pp. 84-85.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike almost every other region, England never produced a 'national' collection, though English personnel played an important role in copying and disseminating Irish and Italian collections in Germany and France.&lt;ref&gt;M. Elliot, ''Canon Law Collections in England ca 600–1066: The Manuscript Evidence'', unpubl. PhD dissertation (University of Toronto, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Around the year 700 there developed in either England or Germany a [[Paenitentiale Theodori|collection of penitential canons]] attributed to [[Theodore of Tarsus]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] (died 690). This collection marked a major advance in the development of penitential-canonical collections, which had already been in development for centuries especially within the Irish church. Collection like the one attributed to Theodore were known as ''[[penitentials]]'', and were often rather short and simple, most likely because they were meant as handbooks for the use of confessors. There were many such books circulating in Europe from the seventh to the eleventh century, each penitential containing rules indicating exactly how much penance was required for which sins. In various ways these penitentials, mainly Insular in origin, came to affect the larger canon law collections in development on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Fournier and Le Bras, ''Histoire des Collections Canoniques en Occident'', vol I, pp. 51-62.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Iberia (i.e. Spain) possessed the ''Capitula Martini'', compiled about 572 by Martin, Bishop of Braga (in Portugal), and the immense and influential ''Collectio Hispana'' dating from about 633, attributed in the 9th century to [[St. Isidore of Seville]]. In the 9th century arose several apocryphal collections, viz. those of [[Benedictus Levita]], of [[Pseudo-Isidore]] (also [[Isidorus Mercator]], Peccator, Mercatus), and the ''Capitula Angilramni''. An examination of the controversies which these three collections give rise to will be found elsewhere (see [[False Decretals]]). The Pseudo-Isidorian collection, the authenticity of which was for a long time admitted, has exercised considerable influence on ecclesiastical discipline, without however modifying it in its essential principles. Among the numerous collections of a later date, we may mention the ''Collectio Anselmo dedicata'', compiled in Italy at the end of the 9th century, the ''Libellus de ecclesiasticis disciplinis'' of Regino of Prum (died 915); the ''Collectarium canonum'' of [[Burchard of Worms]] (died 1025); the collection of the younger [[St. Anselm of Lucca]], compiled towards the end of the 11th century; the ''Collectio trium partium'', the ''Decretum'' and the ''Panormia'' of [[Yves of Chartres]] (died 1115 or 1117); the ''Liber de misericordia et justitia'' of Algerus of Liège, who died in 1132; the Collection in 74 Titles — all collections which Gratian made use of in the compilation of his ''Decretum''

===''Jus Novum''===
The period of canonical history known as the ''Jus Novum'' ("new law") or ''middle period'' covers the time from [[Decretum Gratiani|Gratian]] to the [[Council of Trent]] (mid-12th century–16th century).&lt;ref name=Manual13/&gt;

The spurious conciliar canons and papal decrees were gathered together into collections, both unofficial and official.  In the year 1000, there was no book that had attempted to summarized the whole body of canon law, to systematize it in whole or in part.&lt;ref name=Law&amp;Rev116&gt;Law and Revolution, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, many collections of the decrees of councils and great bishops. These collections usually only had regional force and were usually organized chronologically by type of document (e.g. letters of popes, canons of councils, etc.), or occasionally, by general topic.&lt;ref name=Law&amp;Rev116/&gt; Before the late 11th century, canon law was highly decentralized, depending on many different codifications and sources, whether of local councils, ecumenical councils, local bishops, or of the [[pope|Bishops of Rome]].&lt;ref name=Law&amp;Rev116/&gt;

The first truly systematic collection was assembled by the [[Camaldolese]] monk [[Gratian (jurist)|Gratian]] in the 11th century, commonly known as the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'' ("Gratian's Decree") but originally called ''The Concordance of Discordant Canons''&lt;ref&gt;Law and Revolution, pg. 240&lt;/ref&gt; (''Concordantia Discordantium Canonum''). Canon law greatly increased from 1140 to 1234. After that it slowed down, except for the laws of local councils (an area of canon law in need of scholarship), and secular laws supplemented.&lt;ref&gt;NYTimes.com, [https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/13/books/neighbors-and-wives.html ''Neighbors and Wives'' book review] of Nov-13-1988, accessed 27 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1234 [[Pope]] [[Gregory IX]] promulgated the first official collection of canons, called the ''[[Decretals of Gregory IX|Decretalia Gregorii Noni]]'' or ''Liber Extra''.  This was followed by the ''Liber Sextus'' (1298) of [[Boniface VIII]], the ''Clementines'' (1317) of [[Clement V]], the ''[[Extravagantes Joannis XXII]]'' and the ''[[Extravagantes Communes]]'', all of which followed the same structure as the ''Liber Extra''.  All these collections, with the ''[[Decretum Gratiani]]'', are together referred to as the ''[[Corpus Juris Canonici]]''. After the completion of the ''Corpus Juris Canonici'', subsequent [[papal]] legislation was published in periodic volumes called ''[[Bullarium|Bullaria]]''.

Johannes Gratian was a monk who taught theology at a monastery in [[Bologna]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06730a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a comprehensive and ''comprehensible'' collection of canon law. He resolved contradictions and discrepancies in the existing law.&lt;ref name="High Middle Ages pp. 127"&gt;Europe in the High Middle Ages, pp. 127–128&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1140s his work became the dominant legal text.&lt;ref&gt;Europe in the High Middle Ages, pg. 116&lt;/ref&gt; The papacy appreciated and approved the [[Decretum Gratiani|''Decretum'' of Gratian]]. The ''Decretum'' formed the core of the [[Corpus Iuris Canonici|body of canon law]] upon which a greater legal structure was built.&lt;ref name="High Middle Ages pp. 127"/&gt;{{clarify|note that the [[Decretum Gratiani]] says that his work was NOT approved by the church. This needs resolution either here or in that article|date=February 2013}} Before Gratian there was no "jurisprudence of canon law" (system of legal interpretation and principles). Gratian is the founder of canonical jurisprudence, which merits him the title "Father of Canon Law".&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Kenneth J. Pennington, Ph.D., CL701, CUA School of Canon Law, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVwHMzCUx4k&amp;index=27&amp;list=PLIyjmpcCSGmbeqoESo25a9Rg6YH0BQVnc "History of Canon Law, Day 1"], around 0:25:30, accessed 8-15-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The combination of logical, moral, and political elements contributed to a systematization that was quite different from a merely doctrinal or dogmatic analysis of legal rules, however complex and however coherent. The canon law as a system was more than rules; it was a process, a dialectical process of adapting rules to new situations. This was inevitable if only because of the limits imposed upon its jurisdiction, and the consequent competition which it faced from the secular legal systems that coexisted with it."&lt;ref&gt;Harold J. Berman, "Law and Revolution: The Formation of the Western Legal Tradition", pg. 254&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the thirteenth century, the Roman Church began to collect and organize its canon law, which after a millennium of development had become a complex and difficult system of interpretation and cross-referencing.  The official collections were the ''Liber Extra'' (1234) of Pope [[Gregory IX]], the  ''Liber Sextus'' (1298) of [[Boniface VIII]] and the ''Clementines'' (1317), prepared for [[Clement V]] but published by [[John XXII]].  These were addressed to the universities by papal letters at the beginning of each collection, and these texts became textbooks for aspiring canon lawyers.   In 1582 a compilation was made of the Decretum, Extra, the Sext, the Clementines and the ''[[Extravagantes]]'' (that is, the decretals of the popes from [[Pope John XXII]] to [[Pope Sixtus IV]]).

===''Jus Novissimum''===
After the [[Council of Trent]], an attempt to secure a new official collection of church laws was made about 1580, when [[Gregory XIII]] charged three cardinals with the task. The work continued during the pontificate of [[Sixtus V]], was accomplished under [[Clement VIII]] and was printed (Rome, 1598) as: "Sanctissimi Domini nostri Clementis papæ VIII Decretales", sometimes also "Septimus liber Decretalium". This collection, never approved either by Clement VIII or by [[Paul V]], was edited (Freiburg, 1870) by Sentis. In 1557 the Italian canonist [[Paul Lancelottus]] attempted unsuccessfully to secure from Paul IV, for the four books of his "Institutiones juris canonici" (Rome, 1563), an authority equal to that which its model, the "Institutiones" of Emperor [[Justinian]], once enjoyed in the Roman Empire. A private individual, Pierre Mathieu of Lyons, also wrote a "[[Liber Septimus]] Decretalium", inserted in the appendix to the Frankfort (1590) edition of the "Corpus Juris Canonici". This work was put on the Index.

===''Jus Codicis''===

====Pio-Benedictine law====
{{Main|1917 Code of Canon Law}}
At the [[First Vatican Council]] several bishops asked for a new codification of the canon law, and after that several canonists attempted to compile treatises in the form of a full code of canonical legislation, e.g. de Luise (1873), Pillet (1890), Pezzani (1894), Deshayes (1894), Collomiati (1898–1901). [[Pius X]] determined to undertake this work by his decree "Arduum sane munus" (19 March 1904), and named a commission of cardinals to compile a new "Corpus Juris Canonici" on the model of the [[codification (law)|codes of civil law]]. The 1917 ''Codex Iuris Canonici'' (CIC, Code of Canon Law) was the first instance of a new code completely re-written in a systematic fashion, reduced to a single book or "codex" for ease of use. It took effect on 29 May 1918. It had 2,414 canons.

====Johanno-Pauline law====
{{Main|1983 Code of Canon Law}}
In 1959, Pope John XXIII announced, together with his intention to call the Second Vatican Council and a Synod of the Diocese of Rome, that the 1917 Code would be completely revised.&lt;ref name="John XXIII 1959 pp. 68-69"&gt;John XXIII, [[allocution]] ''Questa festiva'' (25 Jan. 1959), [[Acta Apostolicae Sedis|AAS]] 51 (1959) pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="canonlaw.info"&gt;CanonLaw.info, [http://canonlaw.info/canonlaw_LegisHistory.htm "Legislative History of the 1983 Code of Canon Law"]; accessed June-7-2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, the commission appointed to undertake the task decided to delay the project until the Council had been concluded. After Vatican II closed in 1965, it became apparent that the Code would need to be revised in light of the documents and theology of Vatican II. After decades of discussion and numerous drafts, the project was nearly complete upon the death of [[Paul VI]] in 1978. The work was completed in the pontificate of Pope [[John Paul II]]. The revision was promulgated by the [[apostolic constitution]] "[[Sacrae Disciplinae Leges]]" on 25 January 1983, taking effect on 27 November 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Apostolic Constitution ''Sacrae Disciplinae Leges''| author=Pope John Paul II| accessdate=2007-04-08| date=1983-01-25| publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana| url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_jp-ii_apc_25011983_sacrae-disciplinae-leges_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects of the  ''Codex Iuris Canonici'' (CIC, [[Code of Canon Law]]) are the world's 1.2 billion Catholics of what the Code itself calls the [[Latin Rite|Latin Church]]. It has 7 books and 1,752 canons.

==Oriental canon law==
{{main|Oriental canon law}}
Distinct from the canonical tradition of the [[Latin Church]] is the tradition of the [[Eastern Catholic]] Churches.  The earliest [[Oriental canon law]] collections were called [[nomocanon]]s, which were collections of both [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]].

In the early twentieth century, when Eastern Churches began to come back to full communion with the [[Holy See]], [[Pope Benedict XV]] created the [[Sacred Congregation for the Oriental Church]] in order to preserve the rights and traditions of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]].

Since the early twentieth century, [[Oriental canon law]] had been in the process of codification. Some of these [[Eastern canonical reforms of Pius XII|Oriental canon law reforms]] were [[promulgation (canon law)|promulgated]] by [[Pope Pius XII]]. The codification effort culminated with the [[Pope John Paul II]]'s 1990 promulgation of the ''Codex Canonum Ecclesiarum Orientalium'' (CCEO, [[Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches]]) which incorporates certain differences in the hierarchical, administrative, and judicial ''fora'' for the 23 ''[[sui juris]]'' particular [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], which were each encouraged to issue codes of particular law peculiar to each church, so that all of the [[Catholic Church]]'s canon law would be [[codification (law)|codified]].

The '''monsoon of South Asia''' is among several geographically distributed [[monsoon|global monsoon]]s. It affects the [[Indian subcontinent]], where it is one of the oldest and most anticipated [[weather]] phenomena and an economically important pattern every year from June through September, but it is only partly understood and notoriously difficult to predict. Several theories have been proposed to explain the origin, process, strength, variability, distribution, and general vagaries of the monsoon, but understanding and predictability are still evolving.

The unique [[Geography of India|geographical features of the Indian subcontinent]], along with associated [[atmospheric]], [[ocean]]ic, and [[geophysical]] factors, influence the behavior of the monsoon. Because of its effect on [[agriculture]], on [[flora and fauna]], and on the climates of nations such as [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Pakistan]], and [[Sri Lanka]] — among other [[economic]], [[social]], and [[Natural environment|environmental]] effects — the monsoon is one of the most anticipated, tracked,&lt;ref name="Frater2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Frater|title=Chasing the Monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5I7AAme3yfUC|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=1 May 2005|publisher=Picador|isbn=978-0-330-43313-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied weather phenomena in the region.

==Definition==
The word ''monsoon'' (derived from the Arabic "mausam," meaning "season"), although generally defined as a system of [[winds]] characterized by a seasonal reversal of direction,&lt;ref name=AMS/&gt; lacks a consistent, detailed definition. Some examples are:

==Background==
Observed initially by sailors in the Arabian Sea&lt;ref name="Selin1997"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Helaine Selin|editor-link=Helaine Selin|title=Encyclopaedia of the history of science, technology, and medicine in non-western cultures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raKRY3KQspsC&amp;pg=PA766|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=1997|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-0-7923-4066-9|pages=766–}}&lt;/ref&gt; traveling between [[Africa]], [[India]], and [[Southeast Asia]], the monsoon can be categorized into two ''branches'' based on their spread over the subcontinent:
* Arabian Sea branch
* [[Bay of Bengal]] branch
[[File:Monsoon season beach Tamil Nadu India.jpg|thumb|200px|Southwest monsoon clouds over [[Tamil Nadu]].]]
Alternatively, it can be categorized into two ''segments'' based on the direction of rain-bearing winds:
* Southwest (SW) monsoon 
* Northeast (NE) monsoon&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The name of the wind is based on the direction that it blows ''from''. Southwest winds blow onto the land from the southwest. Northeast winds flow from the northeast toward the southwest, onto the land.&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the time of year that these winds bring rain to India, the monsoon can also be categorized into two ''periods'':
* Summer monsoon (May to September)
* Winter monsoon (October to November)

The complexity of the monsoon of South Asia is not completely understood, making it difficult to accurately predict the quantity, timing, and geographic distribution of the accompanying precipitation. These are the most monitored components of the monsoon, and they determine the water availability in India for any given year.&lt;ref name=IMD1/&gt;

==Changes of the Monsoon==

{{Main article|Monsoon#South Asian Monsoon}}

[[File:Aug2011monsoon.JPG|Monsoon over India|thumb|350px]]
Monsoons typically occur in tropical areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Class 9 CBSE Geography Climate The Mechanism of Monsoons - Wiki|url = http://www.learnnext.com/nextgurukul/wiki/concept/CBSE/IX/Geography/The-Mechanism-of-Monsoons.htm|website = www.learnnext.com|access-date = 2016-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One area that monsoons impact greatly is India.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In India monsoons create an entire season in which the winds reverse completely.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Various atmospheric conditions influence the monsoon winds. The first condition is the differential heating and cooling of land and water. This creates low pressure on the landmass, while high pressure is created over the seas during daytime, but is reversed during the night time.

The second condition is the shift in the position of [[Intertropical Convergence Zone|Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ). In summer, the equatorial trough normally positioned about 5°N of the equator moves over the Ganga plain creating a monsoon trough during the monsoon season.

The third condition is the presence of the high-pressure area that develops east of Madagascar. It is approximately at 20°S over the Indian Ocean. The intensity and position of this high-pressure area affects the Indian Monsoon.

The fourth condition develops during the summer. The Tibetan Plateau gets intensely heated resulting in strong vertical air currents and high pressure over the plateau about 9&amp;nbsp;km above sea level. The fifth condition develops during the summer due to the movement of the westerly jet streams to the north of the Himalayas and the presence of the tropical easterly jet stream over the Indian Peninsula.

Changes in pressure over the southern oceans also affect the monsoons. In certain years, there is a reversal in the pressure conditions. This periodic change in pressure conditions is known as the Southern Oscillation, or SO.

The Southern Oscillation is connected to la nina, which is a warm ocean current that flows past the Peruvian Coast. It flows every two to five years in place of the cold Peruvian current. The phenomenon is, referred to as ENSO (El Nino Southern Oscillations). In India, the monsoon lasts for 100 to 120 days from early June and to mid-September. The monsoon winds encounter various atmospheric conditions on their way and hence are pulsating in nature, and not steady.

The monsoon arrives with a sudden downpour of rainfall that continues for several days. This is known as the ‘burst’ of the monsoon.

The rainfall is a result of the convergence of wind flow from the [[Bay of Bengal]] and reverse winds from the [[South China Sea]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/onset onset] of the monsoon occurs over the [[Bay of Bengal]] in May,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Characteristics, evolution and mechanisms of the summer monsoon onset over Southeast Asia|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/joc.1082/abstract|journal = International Journal of Climatology|date = 2004-10-01|issn = 1097-0088|pages = 1461–1482|volume = 24|issue = 12|doi = 10.1002/joc.1082|language = en|first = Zuqiang|last = Zhang|first2 = Johnny C.

By mid-October, it withdraws completely from the northern half of the peninsula. The withdrawal takes place progressively from north to south from the first week of December to the first week of January. This is the start of the winter season.

The retreating monsoon winds move over the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, and collect moisture on the way. These monsoon winds reach the southern states of India by October, and are responsible for a second round of rainfall. These are called the winter monsoons. The winter monsoon is experienced in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh in the first week of January.

===Effect of geographical relief features===
Although the southwest and northeast monsoon winds are seasonally reversible, they do not cause precipitation on their own.
{{Main article|Rain#Formation}}
Two factors are essential for [[Rain#Formation|rain formation]]:
# [[Rain#Water-saturated air|Moisture-laden winds]]
# [[Rain#Coalescence|Droplet formation]]

Additionally, one of the [[Rain#Causes|causes of rain]] must happen. In the case of the monsoon, the cause is primarily [[Rain#Orographic effects|orographic]], due to the presence of highlands in the path of the winds. Orographic barriers force wind to rise. Precipitation then occurs on the windward side of the highlands because of [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatic cooling]] and condensation of the moist rising air.
{{Main article|Orographic lift}}

The unique [[Geography of India|geographic relief]] features of the Indian subcontinent come into play in allowing all of the above factors to occur simultaneously. The relevant features in explaining the monsoon mechanism are as follows:
# The presence of abundant water bodies around the subcontinent: the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], and [[Indian Ocean]]. These help moisture accumulate in the winds during the hot season.
# The presence of abundant highlands like the [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Himalayas]] right across the path of the southwest monsoon winds. These are the main cause of the substantial [[Orographic lift#Precipitation|orographic precipitation]] throughout the subcontinent.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]] Mountains also lie in the path of the southwest monsoon but do not result in much precipitation because they are in the direction of the path of the southwest winds and not ''across'' them, causing no [[orographic lift]] of the winds.&lt;/ref&gt;
## The Western Ghats are the first highlands of India that the southwest monsoon winds encounter.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Other major highlands, like the [[Cardamom Hills]], [[Anaimalai Hills]], and [[Nilgiri Mountains]], that play active roles in the monsoon are considered major extensions of the Western Ghats and are thus not discussed separately.&lt;/ref&gt; The Western Ghats rise abruptly from the [[Western Coastal Plains]] of the subcontinent, making effective orographic barriers for the monsoon winds.
## The Himalayas play more than the role of orographic barriers for the monsoon. They also help confine it to the subcontinent. Without them, the southwest monsoon winds would blow right over the Indian subcontinent into [[Tibet]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Russia]] without causing any rain.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;First, the Himalayas serve as orographic barriers to the southwest monsoon winds. Second, they help confine the winds to the subcontinent, hampering their northward progress. Third, they contribute to the convergence of the Bay of Bengal branch and Arabian Sea branch of the southwest monsoon winds, increasing the intensity of precipitation over the northern part of the subcontinent. Fourth, they are a major factor in the ''bursting'' of the monsoon under the jet stream theory. Fifth, they help determine the direction of the Bay of Bengal branch of the northeast monsoon. Their role is still a matter of active study, and understanding of them is evolving regularly.&lt;/ref&gt;
## For the northeast monsoon, the highlands of the [[Eastern Ghats]] play the role of orographic barrier.

==Features of monsoon rains==
There are some unique features of the rains that the monsoon brings to the Indian subcontinent.

===''"Bursting"''===
[[File:Mumbai india monsoon clouds.jpg|thumb|220px|"Monsoon burst" over [[Mumbai]].]]
''Bursting of monsoon'' refers to the sudden change in weather conditions in India (typically from hot and dry weather to wet and humid weather during the southwest monsoon), characterized by an abrupt rise in the mean daily rainfall.&lt;ref name="Allaby2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Allaby|title=Encyclopedia of weather and climate|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J1wq-9OSCscC&amp;pg=PA373|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-4801-4|pages=373–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanif2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=M.

===Rain variability (''"vagaries"'')===
One of the most commonly used words to describe the erratic nature of the monsoon is "vagaries," used in newspapers,&lt;ref name=IEvag&gt;{{cite news|last=Kasabe|first=Nanda Dabhole|title=Vagaries apart, monsoon is normal|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/ie/daily/19970723/20450243.html|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=the Indian Express|date=23 July 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; magazines,&lt;ref name="Darpan2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Pratiyogita Darpan]]|title=Pratiyogita Darpan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xOgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT93|accessdate=5 March 2011|date=October 2007|publisher=Pratiyogita Darpan|pages=93–}}&lt;/ref&gt; books,&lt;ref name="Krishnamacharyulu2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Krishnamacharyulu|title=Cases In Rural Marketing: An Integrated Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U4_mXbVC4bwC&amp;pg=PA106|accessdate=5 March 2011|date=1 September 2003|publisher=Pearson Education India|isbn=978-81-317-0188-1|pages=106–}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[web portal]]s&lt;ref name=IWP&gt;{{cite web|title=Agronomic Measures in Dryland Agriculture: An Overview|url=http://www.indiawaterportal.org/node/6979|publisher=India Water Portal|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[insurance]] plans,&lt;ref name=FT1&gt;{{cite news|title=Weather Insurance To Protect A Few|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/printer/news/110251/|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=Financial Express|date=16 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and India's budget discussions.&lt;ref name=MI1&gt;{{cite news|title=Budget must focus on Growth, Food Inflation, FDI, Govt B/s: G Chokkalingam|url=http://www.myiris.com/newsCentre/storyShow.php?fileR=20110222154315043&amp;dir=2011/02/22&amp;secID=livenews|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=myIris.com|date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some years, it rains too much, causing floods in parts of India; in others, it rains too little or not at all, causing droughts. In some years, the rain quantity is sufficient but its timing arbitrary. Sometimes, despite average annual rainfall, the daily distribution or geographic distribution of the rain is substantially skewed. In the recent past, rainfall variability in short time periods (about a week) were attributed to desert dust over the Arabian Sea and [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n4/full/ngeo2107.html|title=Short-term modulation of Indian summer monsoon rainfall by West Asian dust|first1=V.|last1=Vinoj|first2=Philip J.|last2=Rasch|first3=Hailong|last3=Wang|first4=Jin-Ho|last4=Yoon|first5=Po-Lun|last5=Ma|first6=Kiranmayi|last6=Landu|first7=Balwinder|last7=Singh|date=|journal=Nature Geoscience|volume=7|issue=4|pages=308–313|accessdate=20 April 2018|doi=10.1038/ngeo2107|bibcode=2014NatGe...7..308V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideal and normal monsoon rains==
[[File:India annual rainfall map en.svg|thumb|200px|Annual average rainfall in India.]]

Normally, the southwest monsoon can be expected to "burst" onto the western coast of India (near [[Thiruvananthapuram]]) at the beginning of June and to cover the entire country by mid-July.&lt;ref name=IMD1&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Meteorological Department|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|publisher=imd.gov.in|accessdate=3 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224191959/http://imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Monsoon_frame.htm|archivedate=24 December 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDMOK&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Onset Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/MOK.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon Onset dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/newnormalonset.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its withdrawal from India typically starts at the beginning of September and finishes by the beginning of October.&lt;ref name=IMDwith&gt;{{cite web|title=SW Monsoon Normal Withdrawal Dates|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_criteria.htm|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMDwithjpg&gt;{{cite web|title=Monsoon withdrawal dates on Map of India|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/withdrawal_normal.jpg|publisher=Indian Meteorological Department|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northeast monsoon usually "bursts" around 20 October and lasts for about 50 days before withdrawing.&lt;ref name="Wang2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bin Wang|title=The Asian monsoon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRT57TENzT8C&amp;pg=PA188|accessdate=3 March 2011|year=2006|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-40610-5|pages=188–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a rainy monsoon is not necessarily a normal monsoon — that is, one that performs close to [[statistical average]]s calculated over a long period. A normal monsoon is generally accepted to be one involving close to the ''average quantity'' of precipitation over all the geographical locations under its influence (''mean spatial distribution'') and over the entire expected time period (''mean temporal distribution''). Additionally, the ''arrival date'' and the ''departure date'' of both the southwest and northeast monsoon should be close to the mean dates. The exact criteria for a normal monsoon are defined by the [[Indian Meteorological Department]] with calculations for the mean and standard deviation of each of these variables.&lt;ref name=IMDavgMonsoon&gt;{{cite web|title=Met. Terminologies and Glossary - Monsoon|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/Met_Glossary.htm|publisher=[[Indian Meteorological Department]]|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
A monsoon with excess rain can cause floods, and one with too little rain can lead to widespread drought, [[famine]], and economic losses. Therefore, a normal monsoon with mean performance is the most desirable monsoon.

==Theories for mechanism of monsoon==
Theories of the mechanism of the monsoon primarily try to explain the reasons for the seasonal reversal of winds and the timing of their reversal.

===Traditional theory===
{{Main article|Sea breeze}}
Because of differences in the [[specific heat capacity]] of land and water, [[continents]] heat up faster than [[sea]]s. Consequently, the [[air]] above [[coast]]al lands heats up faster than the air above seas. These create areas of low air pressure above coastal lands compared with pressure over the seas, causing winds to flow from the seas onto the neighboring lands. This is known as [[sea breeze]].

====Process of monsoon creation====
{{Main article|Monsoon#Process}}
[[File:Diagrama de formacion de la brisa-breeze.svg|thumb|200px|A: sea breeze; B: land breeze.]]
Also known as the ''thermal theory'' or the ''differential heating of sea and land theory'', the traditional theory portrays the monsoon as a large-scale [[sea breeze]]. It states that during the hot subtropical summers, the massive [[landmass]] of the [[Indian Peninsula]] heats up at a different rate than the surrounding seas, resulting in a [[pressure gradient]] from south to north. This causes the flow of moisture-laden winds from sea to land. On reaching land, these winds rise because of the geographical relief, cooling [[Adiabatic process#Adiabatic heating and cooling|adiabatically]] and leading to orographic rains. This is the ''southwest monsoon''.
The reverse happens during the winter, when the land is colder than the sea, establishing a pressure gradient from land to sea. This causes the winds to blow over the Indian subcontinent toward the [[Indian Ocean]] in a northeasterly direction, causing the ''northeast monsoon''. Because the southwest monsoon flows from sea to land, it carries more moisture, and therefore causes more rain, than the northeast monsoon. Only part of the northeast monsoon passing over the Bay of Bengal picks up moisture, causing rain in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] during the winter months.

However, many meteorologists argue that the monsoon is not a local phenomenon as explained by the traditional theory, but a general weather phenomenon along the entire [[Tropics|tropical zone]] of [[Earth]]. This criticism does not deny the role of differential heating of sea and land in generating monsoon winds, but casts it as one of several factors rather than the only one.

===Dynamic theory===
[[File:Earth Global Circulation.svg|thumb|300px|The atmospheric circulation system with associated pressure belts and latitudes.]]
{{Main article|Prevailing winds}}
{{Main article|Atmospheric circulation}}
The [[prevailing winds]] of the [[atmospheric circulation]] arise because of the difference in pressure at various [[latitudes]] and act as means for distribution of [[thermal energy]] on the planet. This pressure difference is because of the differences in [[solar insolation]] received at different latitudes and the resulting uneven heating of the [[planet]]. Alternating belts of high pressure and low pressure develop along the [[equator]], the two [[tropics]], the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] circles, and the two [[polar region]]s, giving rise to the [[trade wind]]s, the [[westerlies]], and the [[polar easterlies]]. However, geophysical factors like [[Earth's orbit]], its rotation, and its [[axial tilt]] cause these belts to shift gradually north and south, following the [[Sun]]'s seasonal shifts.

====Process of monsoon creation====
The ''dynamic theory'' explains the monsoon on the basis of the annual shifts in the position of global belts of pressure and winds. According to this theory, the monsoon is a result of the shift of the [[Inter Tropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) under the influence of the [[Solar equator|vertical sun]]. Though the mean position of the ITCZ is taken as the equator, it shifts north and south with the migration of the vertical sun toward the Tropics of [[Tropic of Cancer|Cancer]] and [[Tropic of Capricorn|Capricorn]] during the [[summer]] of the respective hemispheres ([[Northern Hemisphere|Northern]] and [[Southern Hemisphere]]). As such, during the northern summer (May and June), the ITCZ moves north, along with the vertical sun, toward the Tropic of Cancer. The ITCZ, as the zone of lowest pressure in the tropical region, is the target destination for the [[trade wind]]s of both hemispheres. Consequently, with the ITCZ at the Tropic of Cancer, the southeast trade winds of the Southern Hemisphere have to cross the equator to reach it.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;When the southeast trade winds cross the equator, they are perceived in the Northern Hemisphere as equatorial westerlies because they seem to blow from the equator toward the Tropic Of Cancer. Similarly, when the ITCZ is at the Tropic of Cancer, the northeast trade winds are confined to the area north of the Tropic of Cancer.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of the [[Coriolis effect]] (which causes winds in the Northern Hemisphere to turn right, whereas winds in the Southern Hemisphere turn left), these southeast trade winds are deflected east in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], transforming into southwest trades.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Change of direction or origin of winds alters their nomenclature as noted above.&lt;/ref&gt; These pick up moisture while traveling from sea to land and cause orographic rain once they hit the highlands of the Indian Peninsula. This results in the southwest monsoon.

The dynamic theory explains the monsoon as a global weather phenomenon rather than just a local one. And when coupled with the traditional theory (based on the heating of sea and land), it enhances the explanation of the varying intensity of monsoon precipitation along the coastal regions with orographic barriers.

===Jet stream theory===
{{Main article|Jet stream}}
[[File:Jetcrosssection.jpg|thumb|300px|Jet streams of Earth]]
This theory tries to explain the establishment of the northeast and southwest monsoons, as well as unique features like "bursting" and variability.

The jet streams are systems of upper-air westerlies. They give rise to slowly moving upper-air waves, with 250-[[knots|knot]] winds in some air streams. First observed by [[World War II]] pilots, they develop just below the [[tropopause]] over areas of steep pressure gradient on the surface. The main types are the ''polar jets'', the ''subtropical westerly jets'', and the less common ''tropical easterly jets''. They follow the principle of [[geostrophic wind]]s.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Geostrophic winds blow parallel to the [[Contour line#Barometric pressure|isobars]] and keep low-pressure zones to their left in the Northern Hemisphere and to their right in the Southern Hemisphere. The reversal is a result of the [[Coriolis effect]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Process of monsoon creation====
[[File:Tibet Karte Topograpisch.png|thumb|250px|The [[Tibetan Plateau]] lies north of the [[Himalayas]].]]
Over India, a subtropical westerly jet develops in the winter season and is replaced by the tropical easterly jet in the summer season. The high temperature during the summer over the [[Tibetan Plateau]], as well as over [[Central Asia]] in general, is believed to be the critical factor leading to the formation of the tropical easterly jet over India.

The mechanism affecting the monsoon is that the westerly jet causes high pressure over northern parts of the subcontinent during the winter. This results in the north-to-south flow of the winds in the form of the northeast monsoon. With the northward shift of the vertical sun, this jet shifts north, too. The intense heat over the Tibetan Plateau, coupled with associated [[terrain]] features like the high altitude of the plateau, generate the tropical easterly jet over central India. This jet creates a low-pressure zone over the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain|northern Indian plains]], influencing the wind flow toward these plains and assisting the development of the southwest monsoon{{Clarify|date=March 2018}}.

==Theories for "bursting"==
The "bursting"&lt;ref name=Allaby2002/&gt; of the monsoon is primarily explained by the jet stream theory and the dynamic theory.

===Dynamic theory===
According to this theory, during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, the ITCZ shifts north, pulling the southwest monsoon winds onto the land from the sea. However, the huge landmass of the Himalayas restricts the low-pressure zone onto the Himalayas themselves. It is only when the Tibetan Plateau heats up significantly more than the Himalayas that the ITCZ abruptly and swiftly shifts north, leading to the bursting of monsoon rains over the Indian subcontinent.
The reverse shift takes place for the northeast monsoon winds, leading to a second, minor burst of rainfall over the eastern Indian Peninsula during the Northern Hemisphere winter months.

===Jet stream theory===
According to this theory, the onset of the southwest monsoon is driven by the shift of the subtropical westerly jet north from over the plains of India toward the Tibetan Plateau. This shift is due to the intense heating of the plateau during the summer months. The northward shift is not a slow and gradual process, as expected for most changes in weather pattern. The primary cause is believed to be the height of the Himalayas. As the Tibetan Plateau heats up, the low pressure created over it pulls the westerly jet north. Because of the lofty Himalayas, the westerly jet's movement is inhibited. But with continuous dropping pressure, sufficient force is created for the movement of the westerly jet across the Himalayas after a significant period. As such, the shift of the jet is sudden and abrupt, causing the bursting of southwest monsoon rains onto the Indian plains. The reverse shift happens for the northeast monsoon.

==Theories for monsoon variability==

===The jet stream effect===
The jet stream theory also explains the variability in timing and strength of the monsoon.

'''Timing:''' A timely northward shift of the subtropical westerly jet at the beginning of summer is critical to the onset of the southwest monsoon over India. If the shift is delayed, so is the southwest monsoon. An early shift results in an early monsoon.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Strength:''' The strength of the southwest monsoon is determined by the strength of the easterly tropical jet over central India. A strong easterly tropical jet results in a strong southwest monsoon over central India, and a weak jet results in a weak monsoon.

===El Niño-Southern Oscillation effect===
{{Main article|El Niño-Southern Oscillation}}
[[File:El Nino regional impacts.png|thumb|righ|300px|Effects of [[El Niño]] on the weather of the subcontinent.]]
[[El nino|''El Niño'']] is a warm ocean current originating along the coast of [[Peru]] that replaces the usual cold [[Humboldt Current]]. The warm surface water moving toward the coast of Peru with El Niño is pushed west by the trade winds, thereby raising the temperature of the southern Pacific Ocean. The reverse condition is known as [[La Niña]].

''Southern oscillation'', a phenomenon first observed by [[Gilbert Walker|Sir Gilbert Thomas Walker]], director general of observatories in India, refers to the seesaw relationship of atmospheric pressures between [[Tahiti]] and [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]], Australia.&lt;ref name=IODhindu&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopal Raj|first=N|title=El Nino &amp; the Indian Ocean Dipole|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2004050401861000.htm&amp;date=2004/05/04/&amp;prd=th&amp;|accessdate=5 March 2011|newspaper=The Hindu|date=4 May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that when pressure was high in Tahiti, it was low in Darwin, and [[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]].&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;  A ''Southern Oscillation Index'' (SOI), based on the pressure difference between Tahiti and Darwin, has been formulated by the [[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)]] to measure the strength of the oscillation.&lt;ref name="Aus"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|title=Climate glossary - Southern Oscillation Index (SOI)|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/glossary/soi.shtml|date=3 April 2007|accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walker noticed that the quantity of rainfall in the Indian subcontinent was often negligible in years of high pressure over Darwin (and low pressure over Tahiti). Conversely, low pressure over Darwin bodes well for precipitation quantity in India. Thus, Walker established the relationship between southern oscillation and quantities of monsoon rains in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

Ultimately, the southern oscillation was found to be simply an atmospheric component of the El Niño/La Niña effect, which happens in the ocean.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Therefore, in the context of the monsoon, the two together came to be known as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) effect. The effect is known to have a pronounced influence on the strength of the southwest monsoon over India, with the monsoon being weak (causing droughts) during El Niño years, while La Niña years bring particularly strong monsoons.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

===Indian Ocean dipole effect===
{{Main article|Indian Ocean Dipole}}
Although the ENSO effect was statistically effective in explaining several past droughts in India, in recent decades, its relationship with the Indian monsoon seemed to weaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=K. K.|author2=Balaji Rajagopalan |author3=Mark A. Cane |title=On the Weakening Relationship Between the Indian Monsoon and ENSO|journal=Science|date=25 June 1999|volume=284|issue=5423|pages=2156–2159|doi=10.1126/science.284.5423.2156|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/284/5423/2156.abstract|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the strong ENSO of 1997 did not cause drought in India.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; However, it was later discovered that, just like ENSO in the Pacific Ocean, a similar seesaw ocean-atmosphere system in the [[Indian Ocean]] was also in play. This system was discovered in 1999 and named the [[Indian Ocean Dipole]] (IOD). An index to calculate it was also formulated. IOD develops in the equatorial region of the Indian Ocean from April to May and peaks in October.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; With a positive IOD, winds over the Indian Ocean blow from east to west. This makes the Arabian Sea (the western Indian Ocean near the African coast) much warmer and the eastern Indian Ocean around Indonesia colder and drier.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; In negative dipole years, the reverse happens, making Indonesia much warmer and rainier.

A positive IOD index often negates the effect of ENSO, resulting in increased monsoon rains in years such as 1983, 1994, and 1997.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; Further, the two poles of the IOD — the eastern pole (around Indonesia) and the western pole (off the African coast) — independently and cumulatively affect the quantity of monsoon rains.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt;

====Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation====
As with ENSO, the atmospheric component of the IOD was later discovered and the cumulative phenomenon named ''Equatorial Indian Ocean oscillation'' (EQUINOO).&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; When EQUINOO effects are factored in, certain failed forecasts, like the acute drought of 2002, can be further accounted for.&lt;ref name=IODhindu/&gt; The relationship between extremes of the Indian summer monsoon rainfall, along with ENSO and EQUINOO,&lt;ref name=EQgadgil&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadgil|first=Sulochana|author2=P.

==Impact of climate change on the monsoon==

Since 1950s, the South Asian summer monsoon underwent a gradual decline, with a reduction of up to 10% over central India.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=Mathew Koll|last2=Ritika|first2=Kapoor|last3=Terray|first3=Pascal|last4=Murtugudde|first4=Raghu|last5=Ashok|first5=Karumuri|last6=Goswami|first6=B.

Since the strength of the monsoon is partially dependent on the temperature difference between the ocean and the land, higher ocean temperatures in the Indian Ocean have weakened the moisture bearing winds from the ocean to the land. The reduction in the summer monsoon rainfall have grave consequences over central India because at least 60% of the agriculture in this region is still largely [[Rainfed agriculture|rain-fed]]. 

A recent assessment of the monsoonal changes indicate that the land warming has increased during 2002-2014, possibly reviving the strength of the monsoon circulation and rainfall&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=Mathew Koll|date=|title=Land warming revives monsoon|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nclimate3356|journal=Nature Climate Change|volume=7|issue=8|pages=549–550|doi=10.1038/nclimate3356|via=|bibcode=2017NatCC...7..549R}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Future changes in the monsoon will depend on a competition between land and ocean—on which is warming faster than the other.

Meanwhile, there has been a three-fold rise in widespread extreme rainfall events during the years 1950 to 2015, over the entire central belt of India, leading to a steady rise in the number of flash floods with significant socioeconomic losses&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roxy|first=M.

Widespread extreme rainfall events are those rainfall events which are larger than 150 mm/day and spread over a region large enough to cause floods.

==Monsoon rain prediction models==
Since the [[Great Famine of 1876–78]] in India, various attempts have been made to predict monsoon rainfall.&lt;ref name=MOL1&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.tropmet.res.in/~kolli/mol/Introduction/frameindex.html|publisher=Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, India|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least five prediction models exist.&lt;ref name="CSgadgil"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gadgil|first=Sulochana|date=10 February 2011|year=|title=Seasonal prediction of the Indian monsoon|url=http://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/100/03/0343.pdf|journal=Current Science|series=3|volume=100|pages=343–353|via=|author2=J. Srinivasan|accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon (SPIM)===
The [[Centre for Development of Advanced Computing]] (CDAC) at [[Bengaluru]] facilitated the Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon (SPIM) experiment on the [[PARAM]] Padma supercomputing system.&lt;ref name=CDADspim&gt;{{cite web|title=Seasonal Prediction of Indian Monsoon(SPIM)|url=http://www.cdacb.in/html/spim.aspx|publisher=Centre for Development of Advanced Computing|accessdate=5 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302113845/http://www.cdacb.in/html/spim.aspx|archivedate=2 March 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This project involved simulated runs of historical data from 1985 to 2004 to try to establish the relationship of five ''atmospheric general circulation models'' with monsoon rainfall distribution.&lt;ref name=CSgadgil/&gt;

===Indian Meteorological Department model===
The department has tried to forecast the monsoon for India since 1884,&lt;ref name=MOL1/&gt; and is the only official agency entrusted with making public forecasts about the quantity, distribution, and timing of the monsoon rains. Its position as the sole authority on the monsoon was cemented in 2005&lt;ref name=CSgadgil/&gt; by the [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology (DST)]], [[New Delhi]]. In 2003, IMD substantially changed its forecast methodology, model,&lt;ref name=Rajeevan1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rajeevapn|first=M. |author2=D. S. Pai |author3=S. K. Dikshit |author4=R. R.

==Significance==
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointDrySeason.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 May in dry season]]
[[File:MatheranPanoramaPointMonsoon.JPG|400px|thumb|[[Western Ghats]],Maharashtra  on 28 August in rainy season]]

The monsoon is the primary delivery mechanism for [[fresh water]] in the Indian subcontinent. As such, it affects the [[Natural environment|environment]] (and associated flora, fauna, and [[ecosystem]]s), agriculture, society, hydro-power production, and geography of the subcontinent (like the availability of fresh water in water bodies and the underground water table), with all of these factors cumulatively contributing to the health of the economy of affected countries.

The monsoon turns large parts of India from semi-deserts into green grasslands. See photos taken only three months apart in the Western Ghats.

===Geographical (wettest spots on Earth)===
[[Mawsynram]] and [[Cherrapunji]], both in the Indian state of [[Meghalaya]], alternate as the wettest places on Earth given the quantity of their rainfall,&lt;ref name=Wettest&gt;{{cite news|last=Philip|first=A J|title=Cherrapunji no longer wettest Challenge comes from nearby village|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2003/20030824/main8.htm|accessdate=9 March 2011|newspaper=The Tribune|date=24 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; though there are other cities with similar claims. They receive more than 11,000 millimeters of rain each from the monsoon.

===Agricultural===
In India, which has historically had a primarily agrarian economy, the [[services sector]] recently overtook the [[farm sector]] in terms of [[GDP]] contribution. However, the [[agriculture]] sector still contributes 17-20% of GDP&lt;ref name=Rediff1&gt;{{cite web|title=How monsoon impacts the Indian economy|url=http://business.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/jun/02/slide-show-1-how-monsoon-impacts-indian-economy.htm|publisher=Rediff.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the largest employer in the country, with about 60% of Indians dependent on it for employment and livelihood.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; About 49% of India's land is agricultural; that number rises to 55% if associated [[wetlands]], [[dryland farming]] areas, etc., are included. Because more than half of these farmlands are rain-fed, the monsoon is critical to food sufficiency and quality of life.

Despite progress in alternative forms of irrigation, agricultural dependence on the monsoon remains far from insignificant. Therefore, the agricultural calendar of India is governed by the monsoon. Any fluctuations in the time distribution, spatial distribution, or quantity of the monsoon rains may lead to floods or droughts, causing the agricultural sector to suffer. This has a cascading effect on the secondary economic sectors, the overall economy, food inflation, and therefore the general population's quality and cost of living.

===Economic===
The economic significance of the monsoon is aptly described by [[Pranab Mukherjee]]'s remark that the monsoon is the "real finance minister of India".&lt;ref name="HT1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBNlive1/&gt;
A good monsoon results in better agricultural yields, which brings down prices of essential food commodities and reduces imports, thus reducing [[food inflation]] overall.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt; Better rains also result in increased hydroelectric production.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;
All of these factors have positive ripple effects throughout the economy of India.&lt;ref name=Rediff1/&gt;

The down side however is that when monsoon rains are weak, crop production is low leading to higher food prices with limited supply.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Monsoon affects economy, health in India|url = http://monsoon.yale.edu/monsoon-affects-economy-health-in-india/|website = WORLD MONSOONS|access-date = 2016-02-15|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Indian government is actively working with farmers and the nation's meteorological department to produce more drought resistant crops.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Social===
[[D. Subbarao]], [[List of Governors of the Reserve Bank of India|former governor of the Reserve Bank of India]], emphasized during a quarterly review of India's [[monetary policy]] that the lives of Indians depend on the performance of the monsoon.&lt;ref name=DS&gt;{{cite news|last=IANS|title=All Indians ‘chasing the monsoon’|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/business/all-indians-chasing-the-monsoon_100402650.html|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=Thaindia.com|date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His own career prospects, his emotional well-being, and the performance of his monetary policy are all "a hostage" to the monsoon, he said, as is the case for most Indians.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt; Additionally, farmers rendered jobless by failed monsoon rains tend to migrate to cities. This crowds city slums and aggravates the infrastructure and sustainability of city life.&lt;ref name=IEtme&gt;{{cite news|last=MITRA|first=SUBHANKAR|title=The monsoon effect|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/the-monsoon-effect/508510/0|accessdate=7 March 2011|newspaper=IndianExpress|date=29 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
In the past, Indians usually refrained from traveling during monsoons for practical as well as religious reasons. But with the advent of globalization, such travel is gaining popularity. Places like [[Kerala]] and the Western Ghats get a large number of tourists, both local and foreigners, during the monsoon season. Kerala is one of the top destinations for tourists interested in [[Ayurveda|Ayurvedic]] treatments and massage therapy. One major drawback of traveling during the monsoon is that most wildlife sanctuaries are closed. Also, some mountainous areas, especially in Himalayan regions, get cut off when roads are damaged by landslides and floods during heavy rains.&lt;ref name=ift&gt;{{cite web|title=Traveling in India during monsoons|url=http://indiafoodtour.com/traveling-in-india-during-monsoons|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental===
The monsoon is the primary bearer of fresh water to the area. The [[Geography of South India#Water bodies|peninsular/Deccan rivers of India]] are mostly rain-fed and non-perennial in nature, depending primarily on the monsoon for water supply.&lt;ref name=IG&gt;{{cite web|title=Rivers-Profile-Know India|url=http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php|publisher=India.gov.in|accessdate=6 March 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204154938/http://india.gov.in/knowindia/rivers.php |archivedate=2011-02-04 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of the [[List of rivers of India#Rivers flowing into Arabian Sea|coastal rivers of Western India]] are also rain-fed and monsoon-dependent.&lt;ref name=IG/&gt;&lt;ref name=IBC&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Geography|url=http://www.indiabook.com/india-information/indian-geography.html|publisher=IndiaBook.com|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the flora, fauna, and entire [[ecosystem]]s of these areas rely heavily on the monsoon. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

{{About|the [[Socratic dialogue]] by [[Xenophon]]|the similarly named treatise sometimes said to be written by [[Aristotle]]|Economics (Aristotle)}}
The '''''Oeconomicus''''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Οἰκονομικός}}) by [[Xenophon]] is a [[Socratic method|Socratic]] dialogue principally about [[household]] [[management]] and [[agriculture]]. 

It is one of the earliest works on [[economics]] in its original sense of household management, and a significant source for the social and intellectual history of Classical [[history of Athens|Athens]]. Beyond the emphasis on household economics, the dialogue treats such topics as the qualities and relationships of men and women, [[rural]] vs. [[urban area|urban]] life, [[slavery]], [[religion]], and [[education]].

[[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]] states that the ''Oeconomicus'' can actually be seen as a treatise on success in leading both an army and a state.

Scholars lean towards a relatively late date in Xenophon's life for the composition of the ''Oeconomicus'', perhaps after 362 BC. [[Cicero]] translated the ''Oeconomicus'' into [[Latin]], and the work gained popularity during the [[Renaissance]] in a number of translations.

==Summary==
The opening framing dialogue is between  Socrates and Critoboulus, the son of [[Crito of Alopece|Crito]]. There Socrates discusses  the meaning of wealth and identifies it with usefulness and well-being, not merely possessions. He links [[moderation]] and hard [[manual labour|work]] to success in household management. The dramatic date of this part of the work can be no earlier than 401 BC, as the [[Battle of Cunaxa]] is referred to at 4.18.

When Critoboulus asks about the practices involved in household management, Socrates pleads ignorance on the subject but relates what he heard of it from an Athenian  [[gentleman]]-[[farmer]] (''[[kalokagathia|kaloskagathos]]'') named Ischomachus. In the discussion related by Socrates, Ischomachus describes the methods he used to educate his wife in [[housekeeping]], their practices in [[governance|ruling]] and [[training]] slaves, and the [[technology]] involved in farming. Approximately two thirds of the dialogue concerns the discussion between Socrates and Ischomachus. There is no final reversion to further discussion with Critoboulos.

==Commentary and interpretation==
[[Leo Strauss]] wrote a [[political]]-[[philosophical]] commentary on the dialogue. He took the ''Oeconomicus'' as a more [[irony|ironic]] examination of the nature of the gentleman, [[virtue]], and domestic relationships.

[[Michel Foucault]] devoted a chapter in his ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976–1984) to "Ischomachus' Household". He took Xenophon's depiction of the relationship between Ischomachus and his wife as a classical expression of the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] [[ideology]] of [[political power|power]], according to which a man's control of his [[emotions]] was externally reflected in his control of his wife, his slaves, and his political subordinates. 

Following Foucault, [[feminist]] [[scholars]] and [[social history|social historians]] such as [[Sarah B. Pomeroy|Sarah Pomeroy]] have explored the ''Oeconomicus'' as a source for Greek attitudes to the relationship between men and women, but successive interpretations have differed. Some see Xenophon's attitude toward women as [[misogynist]] and [[patriarchal]], while others maintain that he was a proto-feminist in certain ways.  

Some have taken Xenophon's use of Ischomachus as a supposed [[expert]] in the education of a wife as an instance of anachronistic irony, a device used by [[Plato]] in his [[Socratic dialogues]]. This ironic line of interpretation sees Ischomachus as a target of [[satire]] rather than a stand-in for Xenophon. Some have suggested that the Ischomachus of the dialogue is the same man whose family became the subject of ridicule in Athenian political oratory. After this Ischomachus died, his widow moved in with her daughter and son-in-law Callias and soon became pregnant with the man's child, which eventually led to the daughter's [[suicide]] attempt. Callias was frequently parodied in Athenian comedies for his [[Human sexuality|sexual]] excesses and [[pseudointellectual|pseudo-intellectualism]].

The import of such irony has also been the subject of much contention: are his wife's actions a sign of a bad education or just the inevitable result of the loss of the controlling influence in her life? How responsible was Ischomachus for his daughter's marriage to a man of such poor [[moral character|character]]?

'''''Organised Sound''''' is an international peer-reviewed [[academic journal]] which focuses on the rapidly developing methods and issues arising from the use of technology in music today. Published three times a year, it concentrates upon the impact which the application of technology is having upon music in a variety of genres, including [[sound art]],  [[sound sculpture]] and music ranging from popular idioms to experimental [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] composition. It thus provides a forum for those interested in electroacoustic music studies, its creation and related developments to share the results of their research as they affect musical issues. Whilst an accompanying CD/CD-ROM/DVD is sent to subscribers annually all media content is or will soon also be available online.

''Organised Sound'' was founded in 1996.  Its editor, [[Leigh Landy]] ([[De Montfort University]], Leicester, UK), is assisted by a diverse range of associated and regional editors.

'''Philosophy of geography''' is the subfield of [[philosophy]] which deals with [[epistemology|epistemological]], [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], and [[axiology|axiological]] issues in [[geography]], with geographic methodology in general, and with more broadly related issues such as the perception and representation of space and place.

==Overview==
Though methodological issues concerning geographical knowledge have been debated for centuries, [[Richard Hartshorne]] (1899–1992) is often credited with its first major systematic treatment in English, ''The Nature of Geography: A Critical Survey of Current Thought in the Light of the Past'', which appeared in 1939, and which prompted several volumes of critical essays in subsequent decades.  [[John Kirtland Wright]] (1891–1969), an American geographer notable for his [[cartography]] and study of the history of geographical thought, coined the related term [[geosophy]] in 1947, for this kind of broad study of geographical knowledge.  Other books oft-cited as key works in the field include [[David Harvey]]'s 1969 ''Explanation in Geography'' and [[Henri Lefebvre]]'s 1974 The Production of Space.  It was a discussion of issues raised by the latter which in part inspired the founding of a ''Society for Philosophy and Geography'' in the 1990s.

The ''Society for Philosophy and Geography'' was founded in 1997 by Andrew Light, a philosopher currently at George Mason University, and Jonathan Smith a geographer at Texas A&amp;M University.  Three volumes of an annual peer-reviewed journal, ''Philosophy and Geography,'' were published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield Press which later became a bi-annual journal published by Carfax publishers.  This journal merged with another journal started by geographers, ''Ethics, Place, and Environment,'' in 2005 to become ''Ethics, Place, and Environment:  A journal of philosophy and geography'' published by Routledge.  The journal was edited by Light and Smith up to 2009, and has published work by philosophers, geographers, and others in allied fields, on questions of space, place, and the environment broadly construed.  It has come to be recognized as instrumental in expanding the scope of the field of environmental ethics to include work on urban environments.

In 2009 Smith retired from the journal and Benjamin Hale from the University of Colorado came on as the new co-editor.  Hale and Light relaunched the journal in January 2011 as Ethics, Policy, and Environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/carfax/1366879X.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080217145734/http://www.tandf.co.uk/journals/carfax/1366879X.html |archivedate=2008-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the journal has since focused more on the relationship between environmental ethics and policy, it still welcomes submissions on relevant work from geographers.

A book series, also initially published by Rowman &amp; Littlefield, and later by Cambridge Scholars Press, began in 2002 to publish the transactions of the ''Society for Philosophy and Geography'''s annual meetings, organized by Gary Backhaus and John Murungi of Towson University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.towson.edu/iasesp/history.htm|title=IASESP Conference History|author=|date=2 October 2007|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002045202/http://www.towson.edu/iasesp/history.htm|archivedate=2 October 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 the society sponsoring these annual meetings became the ''International Association for the Study of Environment, Space, and Place'', and in 2009 the book series gave way to a peer-reviewed journal, ''Environment, Space, Place'', published semiannually and currently edited by C. Patrick Heidkamp, Troy Paddock, and Christine Petto of Southern Connecticut State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zetabooks.com/environment-space-place.html|title=Environment, Space, Place - www.zetabooks.com|author=|date=9 July 2009|website=archive.org|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709084916/http://www.zetabooks.com/environment-space-place.html|archivedate=9 July 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''philosophy of statistics''' involves the [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]], [[Theory of justification|justification]], [[utility]], use and abuse of [[statistics]] and its [[methodology]], and [[ethical]] and [[epistemological]] issues involved in the consideration of choice and interpretation of data and methods of [[statistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jan-Willem |last=Romijn |year=2014 |title=Philosophy of statistics |publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/statistics/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Topics of interest==
* [[Foundations of statistics]] involves issues in [[theoretical statistics]], its goals and [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] methods to meet these goals, [[Parametric statistics|parametric]] assumptions or lack thereof considered in [[nonparametric statistics]], [[model selection]] for the underlying [[probability distribution]], and interpretation of the meaning of inferences made using statistics, related to the [[philosophy of probability]] and the [[philosophy of science]]. Discussion of the selection of the goals and the meaning of optimization, in foundations of statistics, are the subject of the philosophy of statistics.  Selection of distribution models, and of the means of selection, is the subject of the philosophy of statistics, whereas the mathematics of optimization is the subject of nonparametric statistics.
* [[Sir David Cox (statistician)|David Cox]] makes the point {{Citation needed|date=July 2016}} that any kind of interpretation of evidence is in fact a statistical model, although it is known through Ian Hacking's work {{Citation needed|reason=Which of Hacking's works are being referred to here|date=July 2016}} that many are ignorant of this subtlety.
* Issues arise involving [[sample size]], such as cost and efficiency, are common, such as in polling and pharmaceutical research.
* Extra-mathematical considerations in the design of experiments and accommodating these issues arise in most actual experiments.{{elucidate|date=July 2016}}
* The motivation and justification of [[data analysis]] and [[experimental design]], as part of the [[scientific method]] are considered.
* Distinctions between [[inductive reasoning|induction]] and [[logical deduction]] relevant to inferences from [[data]] and [[evidence]] arise, such as when [[frequentist]] interpretations are compared with [[Confidence Interval|degrees of certainty]] derived from [[Bayesian inference]]. However, the difference between induction and ordinary reasoning is not generally appreciated.{{sfn|Hacking|2006}}
* Leo Breiman exposed the diversity of thinking in his article on 'The Two Cultures', making the point that statistics has several kinds of inference to make, modelling and prediction amongst them.{{sfn|Breiman|2001}}
* Issues in the philosophy of statistics arise throughout the [[history of statistics]].  [[Causality]] considerations arise with interpretations of, and definitions of, [[correlation]], and in the [[theory of measurement]].
* Objectivity in statistics is often confused with truth whereas it is better understood as replicability, which then needs to be defined in the particular case. [[Theodore Porter]] develops this as being the path pursued when trust has evaporated, being replaced with criteria.{{sfn|Porter|1995}}
* [[Ethics]] associated with [[epistemology]] and [[medical]] applications arise from potential abuse of statistics, such as selection of method or [[Data transformation (statistics)|transformations]] of the data to arrive at different probability conclusions for the same data set.  For example, the meaning of applications of a [[statistical inference]] to a single person, such as one single cancer patient, when there is no frequentist interpretation for that patient to adopt.
* Campaigns for [[statistical literacy]] must wrestle with the problem that most interesting questions around individual risk are very difficult to determine or interpret, even with the computer power currently available.

'''Physics outreach''' encompasses facets of [[science outreach]] and [[physics education]] and is an [[umbrella term]] for a variety of activities by schools, [[research institutes]], [[universities]], clubs and institutions such as [[science museums]] aimed at broadening the audience for and awareness and understanding of physics. While the general public may sometimes be the focus of such activities, physics outreach often centers on developing and providing resources and making presentations to students, educators in other disciplines, and in some cases researchers within different areas of physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Public engagement, IOP Institute of Physics|url=http://www.iop.org/activity/outreach/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physics Outreach, American Physical Society (APS)|url=https://www.aps.org/programs/outreach/index.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=website for QuarkNet (a nonprofit collaboration, funded by the National Science Foundation and dedicated to developing the USA's technological workforce)|url=https://quarknet.org/content/about-quarknet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ongoing efforts to expand the understanding of physics to a wider audience have been undertaken by individuals and institutions since the early 19th century. Historic works, such as the ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', and [[Two New Sciences]] by [[Galileo Galilei]], sought to present revolutionary knowledge in astronomy, frames of reference, and kinematics in a manner that a general audience could understand with great effect.

In the mid 1800s, English physicist and chemist, [[Michael Faraday]]&lt;ref&gt;Lan, Boon Leong, and Jeanette B. S. Lim. "Michael Faraday: Prince Of Lecturers In Victorian England." The Physics Teacher (Stony Brook, N.Y.) 39.1 (2001): 32-36.&lt;/ref&gt; gave a series of nineteen lectures aimed towards young adults with the hopes of conveying scientific phenomena. His intentions were to raise awareness, inspire them and generate revenue of the [[Royal Institution]]. This series became known as the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Christmas lectures]], and still continues today. By the early 20th century, the public notoriety of physicists such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Marie Curie]], and inventions such as radio led to a growing interest in physics. In 1921, in the United States, the establishment of [[Sigma Pi Sigma]] physics honor society at universities was instrumental in the expanding number of physics presentations, and led to the creation of physics clubs open to all students.&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, P. (1996, October 1). History. Retrieved from http://www.sigmapisigma.org/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums were an important form of outreach but most early [[science museums]] were generally focused on [[natural history]]. Some specialized museums, such as the Cavendish Museum at [[University of Cambridge]], housed many of the historically important pieces of apparatus that contributed to the major discoveries by [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[J. J. Thomson|Thomson]], [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;Visit the Cavendish Museum. (2008, January 1). Retrieved from http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/cav_museum/.&lt;/ref&gt; However, such venues provided little opportunity for [[hands-on learning]] or demonstrations.

In August 1969, [[Frank Oppenheimer]] dedicated his new [[Exploratorium]] in [[San Francisco]] primarily to interactive science exhibits that demonstrated principles in physics. The Exploratorium published the details of their own exhibits in 'Cookbooks' that served as an inspiration to many other museums around the world, and since then has diversified into many outreach programs. Oppenheimer had researched European science museums while on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1965. He noted that three museums served as important influences on the Exploratorium: the [[Palais de la Découverte]], which displayed models to teach scientific concepts and employed students as demonstrators, a practice that directly inspired the Exploratorium's much-lauded High School Explainer Program; the [[South Kensington Museum]] of Science and Art, which Oppenheimer and his wife visited frequently; and the [[Deutsches Museum]] in Munich, the world's largest science museum, which had a number of interactive displays that impressed the Oppenheimers.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Frank Oppenheimer - Biography (long). (2014, January 1) Retrieved from http://www.exploratorium.edu/about/history/frank.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ensuing years, physics outreach, and science outreach more generally, continued to expand and took on new popular forms, including highly successful television shows such as [[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]], first broadcast in 1980.

As a form of outreach within the physics education community for teachers and students, in 1997 the US [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) and Department of Energy [[USDOE]] established [[QuarkNet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quarknet.fnal.gov|title=QuarkNet|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a professional teacher development program. In 2012, the [[University of Notre Dame]] received a $6.1M, five-year grant to support a nationwide expansion of the Quarknet program. Also in 1997, the European Particle Physics Outreach Group, led by [[Christopher Llewellyn Smith]], [[Royal Society|FRS]], and Director General of [[CERN]], was formed to create a community of scientists, science educators, and communication specialists in science education and public outreach for particle physics.  This group became the [http://ippog.web.cern.ch International Particle Physics Outreach Group] (IPPOG) in 2011 after the start up of the [[LHC]]&lt;ref&gt;About IPPOG. (n.d.). Retrieved from http://ippog.web.cern.ch/content/2011/about-ippog&lt;/ref&gt;

==Innovation==
Many contemporary initiatives in physics outreach have begun to shift focus, transcending traditional field boundaries, seeking to engage students and the public by integrating elements of aesthetic design and popular culture. The goal has been not only to push physics out of a strictly [[science education]] framework but also to draw in professionals and students from other fields to bring their perspectives on physical phenomena. Such work includes artists creating sculptures using [[ferrofluid]]s, and art photography using [[High-speed photography|high speed]] and [[Femto-photography|ultra high speed photography]].

Other efforts, such as [[University of Cambridge]]'s [http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/physics_at_work/ Physics at Work] program have created annual events to demonstrate to secondary students uses of physics in everyday life and a [http://www-spc.phy.cam.ac.uk Senior Physics Challenge]. Seeing the importance these initiatives, Cambridge has established a full-time physics outreach organization, an [http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/outreach Educational Outreach Office], and aspirations for a Center of Physics and expanded industrial partnerships that "would include a well equipped core team of outreach officers dedicated to demonstrating the real life applications of physics, showing that physics is an accessible and relevant subject".&lt;ref&gt;The Future of Outreach. Retrieved from http://www.phy.cam.ac.uk/outreach/development&lt;/ref&gt;

The French research group, [http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/supraconductivite/index_en.html La Physique Autrement] (Physics Reimagined), of the [https://www.lps.u-psud.fr/?lang=en Laboratoire de Physique des Solides] works on research about new ways to present modern [[solid-state physics]] and to engage the general public. In 2013, [[Physics Today]] covered this group in an article entitled "Quantum Physics For Everyone"[http://hebergement.u-psud.fr/supraconductivite/pdf/physics_today_bobroff.pdf] which discussed how with the help of designers and unconventional demonstrations, the project sought out and succeeded to engage people who never thought of themselves as interested in science.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Risk management''' is the identification, evaluation, and prioritization of [[risk]]s (defined in [[ISO 31000]] as ''the effect of uncertainty on objectives'') followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability or impact of unfortunate events&lt;ref name="Risk Management pg. 46"&gt;{{cite book|first=Douglas|last=Hubbard|title=The Failure of Risk Management: Why It's Broken and How to Fix It|page=46|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to maximize the realization of opportunities.

Risks can come from various sources including uncertainty in financial markets, threats from project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, [[Act of God|natural causes and disasters]], deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or unpredictable [[Root cause|root-cause]]. There are two types of events i.e. negative events can be classified as risks while positive events are classified as opportunities.  Several risk management [[Technical standard|standards]] have been developed including the [[Project Management Institute]], the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], actuarial societies, and ISO standards.&lt;ref name=voc&gt;{{cite book | author=ISO/IEC Guide 73:2009 | title= Risk management — Vocabulary | publisher=International Organization for Standardization | year=2009 | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=44651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=iso&gt;{{cite book | author=ISO/DIS 31000 | title= Risk management — Principles and guidelines on implementation | publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] | year=2009 | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43170}}&lt;/ref&gt; Methods, definitions and goals vary widely according to whether the risk management method is in the context of project management, security, [[Risk analysis (engineering)|engineering]], [[Industrial Process|industrial processes]], financial portfolios, actuarial assessments, or public health and safety.

Strategies to manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences) typically include avoiding the threat, reducing the negative effect or probability of the threat, transferring all or part of the threat to another party, and even retaining some or all of the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat, and the opposites for opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits).

Certain aspects of many of the risk management standards have come under criticism for having no measurable improvement on risk; whereas the confidence in estimates and decisions seem to increase.&lt;ref name="Risk Management pg. 46"/&gt; For example, one study found that one in six IT projects were "[[black swan theory|black swan]]s" with gigantic overruns (cost overruns averaged 200%, and schedule overruns 70%).&lt;ref name="Bent Flyvbjerg"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flyvbjerg, Bent  |author2=Budzier, Alexander  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011|title=Why Your IT Project May Be Riskier Than You Think|url=https://hbr.org/2011/09/why-your-it-project-may-be-riskier-than-you-think|journal= Harvard Business Review|volume=89|issue=9|pages=601–603}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}


A widely used vocabulary for risk management is defined by ''ISO Guide 73:2009'', "Risk management. Vocabulary."&lt;ref name=voc/&gt;

In ideal risk management, a prioritization process is followed whereby the risks with the greatest loss (or impact) and the greatest [[probability]] of occurring are handled first, and risks with lower probability of occurrence and lower loss are handled in descending order. In practice the process of assessing overall risk can be difficult, and balancing resources used to mitigate between risks with a high probability of occurrence but lower loss versus a risk with high loss but lower probability of occurrence can often be mishandled.

Intangible risk management identifies a new type of a risk that has a 100% probability of occurring but is ignored by the organization due to a lack of identification ability. For example, when deficient knowledge is applied to a situation, a [[knowledge]] risk materializes. Relationship risk appears when ineffective collaboration occurs. Process-engagement risk may be an issue when ineffective operational procedures are applied. These risks directly reduce the productivity of knowledge workers, decrease cost-effectiveness, profitability, service, quality, reputation, brand value, and earnings quality. Intangible risk management allows risk management to create immediate value from the identification and reduction of risks that reduce productivity.

Risk management also faces difficulties in allocating resources. This is the idea of [[opportunity cost]]. Resources spent on risk management could have been spent on more profitable activities. Again, ideal risk management minimizes spending (or manpower or other resources) and also minimizes the negative effects of risks.

According to the definition to the risk, the risk is the possibility that an event will occur and adversely affect the achievement of an objective. Therefore, risk itself has the uncertainty.  Risk management such as COSO ERM, can help managers have a good control for their risk.  Each company may have different internal control components, which leads to different outcomes. For example, the framework for ERM components includes Internal Environment, Objective Setting, Event Identification, Risk Assessment, Risk Response, Control Activities, Information and Communication, and Monitoring.

==Method==

For the most part, these methods consist of the following elements, performed, more or less, in the following order.

# identify, characterize [[threat]]s
# assess the [[vulnerability]] of critical assets to specific threats
# determine the [[risk]] (i.e. the expected likelihood and consequences of specific types of attacks on specific assets)
# identify ways to reduce those risks
# prioritize risk reduction measures

==Principles==

The [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) identifies the following principles of risk management:&lt;ref name="iso3100"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Committee Draft of ISO 31000 Risk management |publisher=[[International Organization for Standardization]] |url=http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |format=PDF |publication-date=2007-06-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325160441/http://www.nsai.ie/uploads/file/N047_Committee_Draft_of_ISO_31000.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk management should:
* create [[value (economics)|value]] – resources expended to mitigate risk should be less than the consequence of inaction
* be an integral part of organizational processes
* be part of decision making process
* explicitly address uncertainty and assumptions
* be a systematic and structured process
* be based on the best available information
* be tailorable
* take human factors into account
* be transparent and inclusive
* be dynamic, iterative and responsive to change
* be capable of continual improvement and enhancement
* be continually or periodically re-assessed

==Process==
According to the standard [[ISO 31000]] "Risk management – Principles and guidelines on implementation,"&lt;ref name=iso /&gt; the process of risk management consists of several steps as follows:

===Establishing the context===
This involves:

#
#*the social scope of risk management
#*the identity and objectives of [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]
#*the basis upon which risks will be evaluated, constraints.
#defining a framework for the activity and an agenda for identification
#developing an analysis of risks involved in the process
#mitigation or solution of risks using available technological, human and organizational resources

===Identification===
After establishing the context, the next step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks.  Risks are about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk identification can start with the source of our problems and those of our competitors (benefit), or with the problem itself.
* Source analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madrid.org/cs/StaticFiles/Emprendedores/Analisis_Riesgos/pages/pdf/metodologia/3IdentificaciondelosRiesgos_en.pdf|title=Risk Identification|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Comunidad de Madrid|page=3|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Risk sources may be internal or external to the system that is the target of risk management (use mitigation instead of management since by its own definition risk deals with factors of decision-making that cannot be managed).
Examples of risk sources are: stakeholders of a project, employees of a company or the weather over an airport.
* Problem analysis{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} – Risks are related to identified threats. For example: the threat of losing money, the threat of abuse of confidential information or the threat of human errors, accidents and casualties. The threats may exist with various entities, most important with shareholders, customers and legislative bodies such as the government.
When either source or problem is known, the events that a source may trigger or the events that can lead to a problem can be investigated. For example: stakeholders withdrawing during a project may endanger funding of the project; confidential information may be stolen by employees even within a closed network; lightning striking an aircraft during takeoff may make all people on board immediate casualties.

The chosen method of identifying risks may depend on culture, industry practice and compliance. The identification methods are formed by templates or the development of templates for identifying source, problem or event. Common risk identification methods are:
* Objectives-based risk identification {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} – Organizations and project teams have objectives. Any event that may endanger achieving an objective partly or completely is identified as risk.
* Scenario-based risk identification – In [[scenario analysis]] different scenarios are created. The scenarios may be the alternative ways to achieve an objective, or an analysis of the interaction of forces in, for example, a market or battle. Any event that triggers an undesired scenario alternative is identified as risk – see [[Futures Studies]] for methodology used by [[Futurists]].
* Taxonomy-based risk identification – The taxonomy in taxonomy-based risk identification is a breakdown of possible risk sources. Based on the taxonomy and knowledge of best practices, a questionnaire is compiled. The answers to the questions reveal risks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sei.cmu.edu/library/abstracts/reports/93tr006.cfm CMU/SEI-93-TR-6 Taxonomy-based risk identification in software industry]. Sei.cmu.edu. Retrieved on 2012-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common-risk checking &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fsa.go.jp/p_fsa/news/newse/ne_023/03.pdf|title=Risk Management Systems Checklist (Common Items)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.fsa.go.jpn|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; – In several industries, lists with known risks are available. Each risk in the list can be checked for application to a particular situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cve.mitre.org Common Vulnerability and Exposures list]. Cve.mitre.org. Retrieved on 2012-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Risk charting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crockford|first=Neil|title=An Introduction to Risk Management|location=Cambridge, UK|publisher=Woodhead-Faulkner|edition=2|year=1986|page=18|isbn=0-85941-332-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; – This method combines the above approaches by listing resources at risk, threats to those resources, modifying factors which may increase or decrease the risk and consequences it is wished to avoid. Creating a [[Risk matrix|matrix]] under these headings enables a variety of approaches. One can begin with resources and consider the threats they are exposed to and the consequences of each.   Alternatively one can start with the threats and examine which resources they would affect, or one can begin with the consequences and determine which combination of threats and resources would be involved to bring them about.

===Assessment===
{{Main article|Risk assessment}}
Once risks have been identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact (generally a negative impact, such as damage or loss) and to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for sure in the case of an unlikely event, the probability of occurrence of which is unknown. Therefore, in the assessment process it is critical to make the best educated decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the [[risk management plan]].

Even a short-term positive improvement can have long-term negative impacts.  Take the "turnpike" example. A highway is widened to allow more traffic. More traffic capacity leads to greater development in the areas surrounding the improved traffic capacity.   Over time, traffic thereby increases to fill available capacity. Turnpikes thereby need to be expanded in a seemingly endless cycles. There are many other engineering examples where expanded capacity (to do any function) is soon filled by increased demand. Since expansion comes at a cost, the resulting growth could become unsustainable without forecasting and management.

The fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is determining the rate of occurrence since statistical information is not available on all kinds of past incidents and is particularly scanty in the case of catastrophic events, simply because of their infrequency. Furthermore, evaluating the severity of the consequences (impact) is often quite difficult for intangible assets. Asset valuation is another question that needs to be addressed. Thus, best educated opinions and available statistics are the primary sources of information. Nevertheless, risk assessment should produce such information for senior executives of the organization that the primary risks are easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized within overall company goals. Thus, there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks. Numerous different risk formulae exist, but perhaps the most widely accepted formula for risk quantification is: "Rate (or probability) of occurrence multiplied by the impact of the event equals risk magnitude."{{vague|section|date=January 2016}}

==Risk options==
Risk mitigation measures are usually formulated according to one or more of the following major risk options, which are:

#Design a new business process with adequate built-in risk control and containment measures from the start.
#Periodically re-assess risks that are accepted in ongoing processes as a normal feature of business operations and modify mitigation measures.
#Transfer risks to an external agency (e.g. an insurance company)
#Avoid risks altogether (e.g. by closing down a particular high-risk business area)

Later research&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CRISC Exam Questions|url=https://www.dumpsbook.com/Exam/CRISC|accessdate= 23 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown that the financial benefits of risk management are less dependent on the formula used but are more dependent on the frequency and how risk assessment is performed.

In business it is imperative to be able to present the findings of risk assessments in financial, market, or schedule terms. Robert Courtney Jr. (IBM, 1970) proposed a formula for presenting risks in financial terms. The Courtney formula was accepted as the official risk analysis method for the US governmental agencies. The formula proposes calculation of ALE (annualized loss expectancy) and compares the expected loss value to the security control implementation costs ([[cost-benefit analysis]]).

===Potential risk treatments===
Once risks have been identified and assessed, all techniques to manage the risk fall into one or more of these four major categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dorfman|first=Mark S. |title=Introduction to Risk Management and Insurance|edition=9 |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-13-224227-3 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)
* Reduction (optimize – mitigate)
* Sharing (transfer – outsource or insure)
* Retention (accept and budget)

Ideal use of these [[risk control strategies]] may not be possible.  Some of them may involve trade-offs that are not acceptable to the organization or person making the risk management decisions. Another source, from the US Department of Defense (see link), [[Defense Acquisition University]], calls these categories ACAT, for Avoid, Control, Accept, or Transfer.  This use of the ACAT acronym is reminiscent of another ACAT (for Acquisition Category) used in US Defense industry procurements, in which Risk Management figures prominently in decision making and planning.

====Risk avoidance====
This includes not performing an activity that could carry risk.  An example would be not buying a [[Real property|property]] or business in order to not take on the [[legal liability]] that comes with it.  Another would be not flying in order not to take the risk that the [[airplane]] were to be [[Aircraft hijacking|hijack]]ed.  Avoidance may seem the answer to all risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting (retaining) the risk may have allowed.  Not entering a business to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits.  Increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher risk conditions, in favor of patients presenting with lower risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry|author2=Fischer, Michael D. |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counseling|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085|url=http://eureka.sbs.ox.ac.uk/4314/1/McGivern_G___Fischer_M_D__%282012%29_Reactivity_and_Reactions_to_Regulatory_Transparency_in_Medicine_Psychotherapy_and_Counselling_%28Authors%27_version%29.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Risk reduction====
Risk reduction or "optimization" involves reducing the severity of the loss or the likelihood of the loss from occurring.  For example, [[Fire sprinkler|sprinkler]]s are designed to put out a [[fire]] to reduce the risk of loss by fire.  This method may cause a greater loss by water damage and therefore may not be suitable.  [[Halomethane|Halon]] fire suppression systems may mitigate that risk, but the cost may be prohibitive as a [[strategy]].

Acknowledging that risks can be positive or negative, optimizing risks means finding a balance between negative risk and the benefit of the operation or activity; and between risk reduction and effort applied. By an offshore drilling contractor effectively applying [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) management in its organization, it can optimize risk to achieve levels of [[residual risk]] that are tolerable.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iadc.org/ebookstore/ebook-iadc-hse-case-guidelines-for-mobile-offshore-drilling-units/ IADC HSE Case Guidelines for Mobile Offshore Drilling Units] 3.2, section 4.7&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern software development methodologies reduce risk by developing and delivering software incrementally.  Early methodologies suffered from the fact that they only delivered software in the final phase of development; any problems encountered in earlier phases meant costly rework and often jeopardized the whole project.  By developing in iterations, software projects can limit effort wasted to a single iteration.

[[Outsourcing]] could be an example of risk sharing strategy if the outsourcer can demonstrate higher capability at managing or reducing risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roehrig|first=P|year=2006|url=http://www.btquarterly.com/?mc=bet-governance&amp;page=ss-viewresearch|title=Bet On Governance To Manage Outsourcing Risk|journal=Business Trends Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a company may outsource only its software development, the manufacturing of hard goods, or customer support needs to another company, while handling the business management itself.  This way, the company can concentrate more on business development without having to worry as much about the manufacturing process, managing the development team, or finding a physical location for a center.

====Risk sharing====
Briefly defined as "sharing with another party the burden of loss or the benefit of gain, from a risk, and the measures to reduce a risk."

The term of 'risk transfer' is often used in place of risk sharing in the mistaken belief that you can transfer a risk to a third party through insurance or outsourcing. In practice if the insurance company or contractor go bankrupt or end up in court, the original risk is likely to still revert to the first party. As such in the terminology of practitioners and scholars alike, the purchase of an insurance contract is often described as a "transfer of risk." However, technically speaking, the buyer of the contract generally retains legal responsibility for the losses "transferred", meaning that insurance may be described more accurately as a post-event compensatory mechanism. For example, a personal injuries insurance policy does not transfer the risk of a car accident to the insurance company. The risk still lies with the policy holder namely the person who has been in the accident. The insurance policy simply provides that if an accident (the event) occurs involving the policy holder then some compensation may be payable to the policy holder that is commensurate with the suffering/damage.

Some ways of managing risk fall into multiple categories. Risk retention pools are technically retaining the risk for the group, but spreading it over the whole group involves transfer among individual members of the group. This is different from traditional insurance, in that no premium is exchanged between members of the group up front, but instead losses are assessed to all members of the group.

====Risk retention====
Risk retention involves accepting the loss, or benefit of gain, from a risk when the incident occurs.  True [[self-insurance]] falls in this category.  Risk retention is a viable strategy for small risks where the cost of insuring against the risk would be greater over time than the total losses sustained. All risks that are not avoided or transferred are retained by default.  This includes risks that are so large or catastrophic that either they cannot be insured against or the premiums would be infeasible.  [[War]] is an example since most property and risks are not insured against war, so the loss attributed to war is retained by the insured.  Also any amounts of potential loss (risk) over the amount insured is retained risk.  This may also be acceptable if the chance of a very large loss is small or if the cost to insure for greater coverage amounts is so great that it would hinder the goals of the organization too much.

===Risk management plan===
{{main|Risk management plan}}

Select appropriate controls or countermeasures to mitigate each risk. Risk mitigation needs to be approved by the appropriate level of management. For instance, a risk concerning the image of the organization should have top management decision behind it whereas IT management would have the authority to decide on computer virus risks.

The risk management plan should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the risks. For example, an observed high risk of computer viruses could be mitigated by acquiring and implementing antivirus software. A good risk management plan should contain a schedule for control implementation and responsible persons for those actions.

According to [[ISO/IEC 27001]], the stage immediately after completion of the [[risk assessment]] phase consists of preparing a Risk Treatment Plan, which should document the decisions about how each of the identified risks should be handled.  Mitigation of risks often means selection of [[security controls]], which should be documented in a Statement of Applicability, which identifies which particular control objectives and controls from the 
standard have been selected, and why.

===Implementation===
Implementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of the risks.  Purchase insurance policies for the risks that it has been decided to transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided without sacrificing the entity's goals, reduce others, and retain the rest.

===Review and evaluation of the plan===
Initial risk management plans will never be perfect. Practice, experience, and actual loss results will necessitate changes in the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions to be made in dealing with the risks being faced.

[[Risk analysis (business)|Risk analysis]] results and management plans should be updated periodically. There are two primary reasons for this: 
# to evaluate whether the previously selected security controls are still applicable and effective
# to evaluate the possible risk level changes in the business environment. For example, information risks are a good example of rapidly changing business environment.

==Limitations==
Prioritizing the ''risk management processes'' too highly could keep an organization from ever completing a project or even getting started.  This is especially true if other work is suspended until the risk management process is considered complete.

It is also important to keep in mind the distinction between risk and [[uncertainty]]. Risk can be measured by impacts × probability.

If risks are improperly assessed and prioritized, time can be wasted in dealing with risk of losses that are not likely to occur.  Spending too much time assessing and managing unlikely risks can divert resources that could be used more profitably.  Unlikely events do occur but if the risk is unlikely enough to occur it may be better to simply retain the risk and deal with the result if the loss does in fact occur. Qualitative risk assessment is subjective and lacks consistency. The primary justification for a formal risk assessment process is legal and bureaucratic.

==Areas==
As applied to [[corporate finance]], ''risk management'' is the technique for measuring, monitoring and controlling the financial or [[operational risk]] on a firm's [[balance sheet]], a traditional measure is the [[value at risk]] (VaR), but there also other measures like [[profit at risk]] (PaR) or [[margin at risk]]. The [[Basel II]] framework breaks risks into [[market risk]] (price risk), [[credit risk]] and operational risk and also specifies methods for calculating [[capital requirement]]s for each of these components.

In Information Technology, Risk management includes "Incident Handling", an action plan for dealing with intrusions, cyber-theft, denial of service, fire, floods, and other security-related events. According to the [[SANS Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sans.org/security-resources/glossary-of-terms/ SANS Glossary of Security Terms] Retrieved on 2016-11-13&lt;/ref&gt; it is a six step process: Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned.

===Enterprise===
{{Main article|Enterprise Risk Management}}
In enterprise risk management, a risk is defined as a possible event or circumstance that can have negative influences on the enterprise in question.  Its impact can be on the very existence, the resources (human and capital), the products and services, or the customers of the enterprise, as well as external impacts on society, markets, or the environment.  In a financial institution, enterprise risk management is normally thought of as the combination of credit risk, [[interest rate risk]] or [[asset liability management]], liquidity risk, market risk, and operational risk.

In the more general case, every probable risk can have a pre-formulated plan to deal with its possible consequences (to ensure ''contingency'' if the risk becomes a ''liability'').

From the information above and the average cost per employee over time, or [[cost accrual ratio]], a project manager can estimate:

* the cost associated with the risk if it arises, estimated by multiplying employee costs per unit time by the estimated time lost (''cost impact'', ''C'' where ''C = cost accrual ratio * S''){{abbreviations|date=September 2016}}.
* the probable increase in time associated with a risk (''schedule variance due to risk'', ''Rs'' where Rs = P * S):
** Sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the schedule first. This is intended to cause the greatest risks to the project to be attempted first so that risk is minimized as quickly as possible.
** This is slightly misleading as ''schedule variances'' with a large P and small S and vice versa are not equivalent. (The risk of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] sinking vs. the passengers' meals being served at slightly the wrong time).
* the probable increase in cost associated with a risk (''cost variance due to risk'', ''Rc'' where Rc = P*C = P*CAR*S = P*S*CAR)
** sorting on this value puts the highest risks to the budget first.
** see concerns about ''schedule variance'' as this is a function of it, as illustrated in the equation above.

Risk in a [[project]] or [[business process|process]] can be due either to [[Special Cause Variation]] or [[Common Cause Variation]] and requires appropriate treatment.  That is to re-iterate the concern about extremal cases not being equivalent in the list immediately above.

===Enterprise Security===
ESRM is a security program management approach that links security activities to an enterprise's mission and business goals through risk management methods. The security leader's role in ESRM is to manage risks of harm to enterprise assets in partnership with the business leaders whose assets are exposed to those risks. ESRM involves educating business leaders on the realistic impacts of identified risks, presenting potential strategies to mitigate those impacts, then enacting the option chosen by the business in line with accepted levels of business risk tolerance&lt;ref&gt;ASIS https://www.asisonline.org/publications--resources/news/blog/esrm-an-enduring-security-risk-model/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical device===
For medical devices, risk management is a process for identifying, evaluating and mitigating risks associated with harm to people and damage to property or the environment. Risk management is an integral part of medical device design and development, production processes and evaluation of field experience, and is applicable to all types of medical devices. The evidence of its application is required by most regulatory bodies such as the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]]. The management of risks for medical devices is described by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in ISO 14971:2007, Medical Devices—The application of risk management to medical devices, a product safety standard. The standard provides a process framework and associated requirements for management responsibilities, risk analysis and evaluation, risk controls and lifecycle risk management.

The European version of the risk management standard was updated in 2009 and again in 2012 to refer to the Medical Devices Directive (MDD) and Active Implantable Medical Device Directive (AIMDD) revision in 2007, as well as the In Vitro Medical Device Directive (IVDD). The requirements of EN 14971:2012 are nearly identical to ISO 14971:2007. The differences include three "(informative)" Z Annexes that refer to the new MDD, AIMDD, and IVDD.  These annexes indicate content deviations that include the requirement for risks to be reduced ''as far as possible'', and the requirement that risks be mitigated by design and not by labeling on the medical device (i.e., labeling can no longer be used to mitigate risk).

Typical risk analysis and evaluation techniques adopted by the medical device industry include [[hazard analysis]], [[fault tree analysis]] (FTA), [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), hazard and operability study ([[HAZOP]]), and risk traceability analysis for ensuring risk controls are implemented and effective (i.e. tracking risks identified to product requirements, design specifications, verification and validation results etc.). FTA analysis requires diagramming software. FMEA analysis can be done using a [[spreadsheet]] program. There are also integrated medical device risk management solutions.

Through a [http://www.fda.gov/medicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm206153.htm draft guidance], the FDA has introduced another method named "Safety Assurance Case" for medical device safety assurance analysis. The safety assurance case is structured argument reasoning about systems appropriate for scientists and engineers, supported by a body of evidence, that provides a compelling, comprehensible and valid case that a system is safe for a given application in a given environment. With the guidance, a safety assurance case is expected for safety critical devices (e.g. infusion devices) as part of the pre-market clearance submission, e.g. 510(k). In 2013, the FDA introduced another draft guidance expecting medical device manufacturers to submit cybersecurity risk analysis information.

===Project management===
{{Main article| project risk management}}
Project risk management must be considered at the different phases of acquisition.  In the beginning of a project, the advancement of technical developments, or threats presented by a competitor's projects, may cause a risk or threat assessment and subsequent evaluation of alternatives (see [[Analysis of Alternatives]]). Once a decision is made, and the project begun, more familiar project management applications can be used:&lt;ref&gt;Lev Virine and Michael Trumper. ''Project Decisions: The Art and Science''.

What Is Risk Management?  http://www.slideshare.net/igorkokcharov/what-is-project-risk-management&lt;/ref&gt;]]

* Planning how risk will be managed in the particular project.  Plans should include risk management tasks, responsibilities, activities and budget.
* Assigning a risk officer – a team member other than a project manager who is responsible for foreseeing potential project problems.  Typical characteristic of risk officer is a healthy skepticism.
* Maintaining live project risk database.  Each risk should have the following attributes: opening date, title, short description, probability and importance.  Optionally a risk may have an assigned person responsible for its resolution and a date by which the risk must be resolved.
* Creating anonymous risk reporting channel.  Each team member should have the possibility to report risks that he/she foresees in the project.
* Preparing mitigation plans for risks that are chosen to be mitigated.  The purpose of the mitigation plan is to describe how this particular risk will be handled – what, when, by whom and how will it be done to avoid it or minimize consequences if it becomes a liability.
* Summarizing planned and faced risks, effectiveness of mitigation activities, and effort spent for the risk management.

===Megaprojects (infrastructure)===
[[Megaproject]]s (sometimes also called "major programs") are large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than $1 billion per project. Megaprojects include major bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection schemes, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defense systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts.&lt;ref name="Megaprojects and Risk"&gt;{{cite book|first=Bent|last=Flyvbjerg|title=Megaprojects and Risk: An Anatomy of Ambition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|ISBN=0521804205|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk management is therefore particularly pertinent for megaprojects and special methods and special education have been developed for such risk management.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford BT Centre for Major Programme Management]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural disasters===
It is important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like [[Flood risk assessment|floods]], [[seismic hazard|earthquakes]], and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, business interruption losses and other downtime, effects on the environment, insurance costs, and the proposed costs of reducing the risk.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Alan.

===Wilderness===

The management of risks to persons and property in [[Wilderness|wilderness]] and remote natural areas has developed with increases in outdoor recreation participation and decreased social tolerance for loss.  Organizations providing commercial wilderness experiences can now align with national and international consensus standards for training and equipment such as [[American_National_Standards_Institute|ANSI]]/NASBLA 101-2017 (boating)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American National Standard ANSI/NASBLA 101-2017: Basic Boating Knowledge--Human Propelled|url= https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.americancanoe.org/resource/resmgr/spp-documents/ANSI_NASBLA_101-2017_Human_P.pdf|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[International_Climbing_and_Mountaineering_Federation|UIAA]] 152 (ice climbing tools)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UIAA Standard 152: Ice Tools|url= https://www.theuiaa.org/documents/safety-standards/152_IceTools_UIAA2018.pdf|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[European_Committee_for_Standardization|European Norm]] 13089:2015 + A1:2015 (mountaineering equipment)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EN 13089 Mountaineering equipment - Ice-tools - Safety requirements and test methods (includes Amendment A1:2015)|url= https://www.en-standard.eu/din-en-13089-mountaineering-equipment-ice-tools-safety-requirements-and-test-methods-includes-amendment-a1-2015/|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish Standard I.S.EN 13089:2011+A1:2015 Mountaineering equipment - Ice-tools - Safety requirements and test methods|url= https://infostore.saiglobal.com/preview/is/en/2011/i.s.en13089-2011%2Ba1-2015.pdf?sku=1458668|accessdate=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Information technology===
{{Main article|IT risk management}}
[[IT risk]] is a risk related to information technology. This is a relatively new term due to an increasing awareness that [[information security]] is simply one facet of a multitude of risks that are relevant to IT and the real world processes it supports.

[[ISACA]]'s ''[[Risk IT]]'' framework ties IT risk to [[enterprise risk management]].

Duty of Care Risk Analysis (DoCRA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://docra.org/|title=Duty of Care Risk Analysis Standard (DoCRA)|last=|first=|date=|website=DoCRA|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; evaluates risks and their safeguards and considers the interests of all parties potentially affected by those risks.

CIS RAM provides a method to design and evaluate the implementation of the CIS Controls™.

===Petroleum and natural gas===
For the offshore oil and gas industry, operational risk management is regulated by the [[safety case]] regime in many countries. Hazard identification and risk assessment tools and techniques are described in the international standard ISO 17776:2000, and organisations such as the IADC ([[International Association of Drilling Contractors]]) publish guidelines for [[Health, Safety and Environment]] (HSE) Case development which are based on the ISO standard. Further, diagrammatic representations of hazardous events are often expected by governmental regulators as part of risk management in safety case submissions; these are known as '''[[bow-tie diagram]]s''' (see [[Network theory in risk assessment]]). The technique is also used by organisations and regulators in mining, aviation, health, defence, industrial and finance.

===Pharmaceutical sector===
The principles and tools for quality risk management are increasingly being applied to different aspects of pharmaceutical quality systems. These aspects include development, manufacturing, distribution, inspection, and submission/review processes throughout the lifecycle of drug substances, drug products, biological and biotechnological products (including the use of raw materials, solvents, excipients, packaging and labeling materials in drug products, biological and biotechnological products). Risk management is also applied to the assessment of [http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2011/126.html microbiological contamination] in relation to pharmaceutical products and cleanroom manufacturing environments.&lt;ref name=Sandle&gt;{{cite book | author = Saghee M, Sandle T, Tidswell E (editors) | title = Microbiology and Sterility Assurance in Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices | edition = 1st | publisher = Business Horizons | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-8190646741}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk communication==
Risk communication is a complex cross-disciplinary academic field related to [[Value system|core values]] of the targeted audiences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.navy.mil/sites/nmcphc/Documents/policy-and-instruction/nmcphc-risk-communications-primer.pdf Risk Communication Primer—Tools and Techniques]. Navy and Marine Corps Public Health Center&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.start.umd.edu/sites/default/files/files/publications/UnderstandingRiskCommunicationTheory.pdf Understanding Risk Communication Theory: A Guide for Emergency Managers and Communicators]. Report to Human Factors/Behavioral Sciences Division, Science and Technology Directorate,  U.S. Department of Homeland Security (May 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Problems for risk communicators involve how to reach the intended audience, how to make the risk comprehensible and relatable to other risks, how to pay appropriate respect to the audience's values related to the risk, how to predict the audience's response to the communication, etc. A main goal of risk communication is to improve collective and individual decision making. Risk communication is somewhat related to [[crisis communication]]. Some experts coincide that risk is not only enrooted in the communication process but also it cannot be dissociated from the use of language. Though each culture develops its own fears and risks, these construes apply only by the hosting culture.

[[File:Deutsch-Verzeichnis 1978.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Deutsch-Verzeichnis 1978]]
'''''Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of all his Works in Chronological Order''''', also known as the '''Deutsch catalogue''', is a numbered list of all compositions by [[Franz Schubert]] compiled by [[Otto Erich Deutsch]]. Since its first publication in 1951, Deutsch (abbreviated as D or D.) numbers are used for the unique identification of Schubert's compositions.

==1951 edition==
The Deutsch catalogue was first published in London in 1951, as ''Schubert: Thematic Catalogue of all his Works in Chronological Order, compiled by O. E. Deutsch, in collaboration with Donald R. Wakeling.''

==1978 edition: NSE VIII/4==
In 1978, as part VIII Supplement / Volume 4 of the [[New Schubert Edition]] (NSE), an updated version of the catalogue was published in German.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

A few compositions that had been undated in the first edition received a new number (usually followed by a letter), e.g. {{D.|u|number=993}} was renumbered to {{D.|u|number=2E}}

==Later versions==
The original 1951 edition (in English) was re-issued several times, for instance in the United States by W. W. Norton. The 1978 version, published by Bärenreiter, had a double objective: it was not only a list of Schubert's works as such, it was also the compendium of all scores published by that publisher in the New Schubert Edition.

===New versions in English===
In 1995 [[Dover Publications]] republished the 1951 edition, with updates derived from scholarship that had been published since 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

===New versions in German===
From 1983 compact versions of the catalogue appeared, edited by Werner Aderhold and others.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to the numbering of Schubert's works were minor in these later editions.&lt;ref&gt;Aderhold 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26216">'''Sex therapy''' is a strategy for the improvement of sexual function and treatment of [[sexual dysfunction]].  This includes sexual dysfunctions such as [[premature ejaculation]] or [[delayed ejaculation]], [[erectile dysfunction]], lack of sexual interest or arousal, and [[painful sex]] ([[vaginismus]] and [[dyspareunia]]).  It includes dealing with problems imposed by atypical sexual interests ([[paraphilia]]s), [[gender dysphoria]] and [[transgender]] issues, very high sex drive or [[hypersexuality]], a lack of sexual confidence, recovering from [[sexual assault]], and sexual issues in aging, illness, or disability.&lt;ref name = BinikHall&gt;Binik, Y. M., &amp; Hall, K. S. K. (2014). ''Principles and practice of sex therapy (5th ed.).''  NY: Guildford,&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practice ==
Modern sex therapy often integrates [[psychotherapy|psychotherapeutic]] techniques and medical ones,&lt;ref name = Bancroft2009&gt;Bancroft, J. (2009). ''Human Sexuality and Its Problems (3rd ed.).''  Edinburgh: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt; such as Viagra ([[sildenafil]]) to increase erectile response and Paxil ([[paroxetine]]) to treat premature ejaculation.  Sex therapists assist those experiencing problems in overcoming them, in doing so possibly regaining an active sex life.  The transformative approach to sex therapy aims to understand the [[psychological]], biological, [[pharmacological]], relational, and contextual aspects of sexual problems.&lt;ref name="Sex Therapy Today"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leiblum|first=Sandra|title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Fourth Edition, Chapter 1: Sex Therapy Today, Current Issues and Future Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoG26ZJ-gkkC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=sex+therapy+#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20therapy&amp;f=false|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=15 March 2014|isbn=978-1-60623-827-1|date=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex therapy requires rigorous evaluation that includes a medical and psychological examination. The reason is that sexual dysfunction may have a somatic base or a psychogenic basis. A clear example is erectile dysfunction (sometimes still called "impotence"), whose etiology may include, firstly, circulatory problems, and secondly, performance anxiety. Sex therapy is frequently short term, with duration depending on the causes for therapy.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex therapy can be provided by licensed psychologists or physicians, who have undergone training and become certified.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT) oversees clinical training for a sexual health practitioner to become a certified sex therapist (CST).  Any licensed mental health counselor can practice sex therapy.

Sex therapy is distinct from [[sexual surrogate|sex surrogates]].  Whereas sex therapists discuss and instruct clients in sex-based exercises to be performed at home between sessions, sexual surrogates participate in the exercises with their clients as part of helping them to practice and develop improved skills.  Therapists and surrogates sometimes collaborate on cases.  Certified sex therapists do not have sexual contact with their clients.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symptoms ===
Sex therapy sessions are focused on the individual's symptoms rather than on underlying [[psychodynamic]] conflicts. The sexual dysfunctions which may be addressed by sex therapy include non-consummation, premature ejaculation, erectile dysfunction, low libido, unwanted sexual fetishes, sexual addiction, painful sex, or a lack of sexual confidence, assisting people who are recovering from sexual assault, problems commonly caused by stress, tiredness, and other environmental and relationship factors. Sex therapy can either be on an individual basis or with the sex partner.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex therapy can be conducted with any adult, including older adults; any [[gender expression]]; and [[LGBTQ]]-identified people.&lt;ref name="Mayo Clinic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayo Clinic|title=Sex Therapy Definition|url=http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/sex-therapy/basics/definition/prc-20020669|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A therapist's misunderstanding of these conflicts can lead to resistance or serve as a barrier to improving sexual dysfunctions that are directly or indirectly related to sex.&lt;ref name="The_New_Sex_Therapy"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-3000-4_25|chapter=The New Sex Therapy|title=The Interface Between the Psychodynamic and Behavioral Therapies|pages=363|year=1980|last1=Kaplan|first1=Helen Singer|isbn=978-1-4613-3002-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interest in sex therapy among couples has increased along with the number of sexuality educators, counselors, and therapists.&lt;ref name="The_New_Sex_Therapy" /&gt; Today, sexual problems are no longer regarded as symptoms of hidden deviant, pathological, or psychological defects in maturity or development.&lt;ref name="Sex Therapy Today"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leiblum|first=Sandra|title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Fourth Edition, Chapter 1: Sex Therapy Today, Current Issues and Future Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoG26ZJ-gkkC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=sex+therapy+#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20therapy&amp;f=false|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=15 March 2014|isbn=978-1-60623-827-1|date=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex therapy has also influenced the emergence of sexual medicine and exploring integrative approaches to sex therapy, in addition to reducing or eliminating sexual problems and increasing sexual satisfaction for individuals of all stages of life. Health therapists, educators, and counselors are conducting research and administering surveys to fully understand normative sexual function – what most people do and experience as they grow older and live longer.&lt;ref name="Sex Therapy Today"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leiblum|first=Sandra|title=Principles and Practice of Sex Therapy, Fourth Edition, Chapter 1: Sex Therapy Today, Current Issues and Future Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/?id=IoG26ZJ-gkkC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=sex+therapy+#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20therapy&amp;f=false|publisher=Guilford Press|accessdate=15 March 2014|isbn=978-1-60623-827-1|date=2006-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aging and sexuality ==

{{See also|Sexuality in older age}}
Both physical and emotional transformation throughout various stages of life can affect the body and sexuality. The subsequent decline in [[hormone]] levels and changes in [[neurological]] and [[circulatory]] functioning may lead to sexual problems such as [[erectile dysfunction]] or vaginal pain.&lt;ref name="Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard Health Publications|title=Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/special_health_reports/Sexuality_in_Midlife_and_Beyond|publisher=Harvard Health|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These physical changes often affect the intensity of youthful sex and may give way to more subdued responses during [[Middle age|middle]] and [[Old age|later]] life.&lt;ref name="Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard Health Publications|title=Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/special_health_reports/Sexuality_in_Midlife_and_Beyond|publisher=Harvard Health|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues with low [[libido]] and [[sexual dysfunction]] are usually considered to be a byproduct of old age. The emotional byproducts of maturity, however — increased confidence, better communication skills, and lessened inhibitions — can help create a richer, more nuanced, and ultimately satisfying sexual experience.&lt;ref name="Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond"&gt;{{cite web|last=Harvard Health Publications|title=Sexuality in Midlife and Beyond|url=http://www.health.harvard.edu/special_health_reports/Sexuality_in_Midlife_and_Beyond|publisher=Harvard Health|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During AARP's last surveys in 1999, 2004, and 2009 statistics well-being among older adults has increased; however, overall sexual satisfaction has decreased.&lt;ref name="Sex, Romance, and Relationships of Older Adults"&gt;{{cite web|last=Garrett|first=Mario|title=Sex, Romance, and Relationships of Older Adults|publisher=''[[Psychology Today]]''|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/iage/201305/sex-romance-and-relationships-older-adults|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, older adults believed that an active sexual life offers great pleasure but contributes materially to overall emotional and physical health.&lt;ref name="Sex, Romance, and Relationships of Older Adults" /&gt;

=== Older adults ===
[[File:Old couple in love.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A woman touches a man's face.|Sex therapy, at any age, often involves sensate-focused touching]]

Over the years, little attention has been paid to older adults and sexuality. As the population of older adults and life expectancy continues to grow, there is information about sex therapy but it is often not easily accepted. Cultural and sexual roles are always changing throughout the lifecourse. As people age, they are often viewed as [[Asexuality|asexual]] or as incapable of possessing sexual desires. The presence of sexual dysfunction during old age can be impacted by health problems. There are many [[endocrine]], [[vascular]] and [[neurological]] disorders that may interfere in sexual function, along with some medications and surgeries.&lt;ref name="Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillman|first=Jennifer|title=Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients|url=http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|publisher=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502114805/http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older men experience changes that occur in sexual [[physiology]] and affect both erectile function and [[ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillman|first=Jennifer|title=Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients|url=http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|publisher=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502114805/http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While older women experience [[physiological]] effects of aging after [[menopause]], resulting in the decreased production of [[estrogen]]. This leads to increased vaginal dryness, general atrophy of vaginal tissue, and genital changes (reduced size of [[clitoral]], vulvar, and labial tissue).&lt;ref name="Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillman|first=Jennifer|title=Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients|url=http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|publisher=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502114805/http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive]] changes and decline is another factor that influences sexual activity. [[Dementia]], [[Alzheimer's]] and other [[mental health disorders]] may have an effect on sexual behavior, producing [[disinhibition]] or relationship difficulties with subsequent effects on couple's sexual relationships.&lt;ref name="Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillman|first=Jennifer|title=Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients|url=http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|publisher=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502114805/http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex therapy with older adults looks at factors which influence sexuality in older adults, including sexual desire, sexual activity, the value of sexuality, and health.&lt;ref name="The Impact of Aging on Human Sexual Activity and Sexual Desire"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kontula|first=O|title=The Impact of Aging on Human Sexual Activity and Sexual Desire|url=http://lifeworksrecovery.com/certified-addiction-therapist|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806035103/http://www.lifeworksrecovery.com/certified-addiction-therapist/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=6 August 2016|publisher=Journal of Sex Research|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can include [[sensate focus]], communication, and fantasy exercises as well as [[psychodynamic therapy]].&lt;ref name="Sexual and Relationship Therapy"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14681990410001715445|title=Sex and death: The ramifications of illness and aging in older couple relationships|journal=Sexual and Relationship Therapy|volume=19|issue=3|pages=319|year=2004|last1=Evans|first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex therapy for older adults is similar to sex therapy with other populations. It includes the use of water-based [[personal lubricants]] (for decreased vaginal lubrication), [[hormone therapy]], and medications.&lt;ref name="Sexual Function"&gt;.{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Carol|title=Nursing for Wellness in Older Adults: Chapter 26, Sexual Function|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yUx01gmNLboC&amp;pg=PA555&amp;lpg=PA555&amp;dq=sex+therapy+and+older+adults#v=onepage&amp;q=sex%20therapy%20and%20older%20adults&amp;f=false|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|accessdate=15 March 2014|isbn=978-0-7817-7175-7|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex therapists working with older adults should know about sexuality and aging.&lt;ref name="Sexual and Relationship Therapy"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14681990410001715445|title=Sex and death: The ramifications of illness and aging in older couple relationships|journal=Sexual and Relationship Therapy|volume=19|issue=3|pages=319|year=2004|last1=Evans|first1=Sandra}}&lt;/ref&gt; They should also be aware of how stereotypes affect their clients.&lt;ref name="Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hillman|first=Jennifer|title=Sexual Issues and Aging Within the Context of Work With Older Adult Patients|url=http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|publisher=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice|accessdate=15 March 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502114805/http://www.globalaging.org/health/us/2009/elderly%20sexuality.pdf|archivedate=2 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially true for [[LGBT]]-identified clients.&lt;ref name="Sexual Function" /&gt;

Sexologists such as [[Henry Havelock Ellis]] and [[Alfred Kinsey]] began conducting research in the area of human sexuality during the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="The History and Evolution of Sex Therapy and its Relationship to Psychoanalysis"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/aps.1315|title=The History and Evolution of Sex Therapy and its Relationship to Psychoanalysis|journal=International Journal of Applied Psychoanalytic Studies|volume=10|pages=53|year=2013|last1=Berry|first1=Michael D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sex Therapy: Historical Evolution, Current Practice.

In the 1950s, sex therapy was concerned with “controlling sexual expression” and repressing what was then-considered deviant behaviors, such as homosexuality or having sex too often.&lt;ref name="Sex Therapy: Historical Evolution, Current Practice.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13014">'''Social physics''' or '''sociophysics''' is a field of science which uses mathematical tools inspired by [[physics]] to understand the behavior of human crowds. In a modern commercial use, it can also refer to the analysis of social phenomena with [[big data]].

Social physics is closely related to [[econophysics]] which uses physics methods to describe [[economics]].

==History==
The first elements of social physics were outlined in French social thinker [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]]’s first book, the 1803 ''Lettres d’un Habitant de Geneve'', which described the idea of describing society using laws similar to those of the physical and biological sciences.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iggers|first=Georg G.|year=1959|title=Further Remarks about Early Uses of the Term "Social Science"|jstor=2708121|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|volume=20|issue=3|pages=433–436|doi=10.2307/2708121}}&lt;/ref&gt; His student and collaborator was [[Auguste Comte]], a French philosopher widely regarded as the founder of [[sociology]], who first defined the term in an essay appearing in ''Le Producteur'', a journal project by Saint-Simon.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Comte defined social physics as&lt;blockquote&gt;Social physics is that science which occupies itself with social phenomena, considered in the same light as astronomical, physical, chemical, and physiological phenomena, that is to say as being subject to natural and invariable laws, the discovery of which is the special object of its researches. &lt;/blockquote&gt;After Saint-Simon and Comte, Belgian statistician [[Adolphe Quetelet]], proposed that society be modeled using [[mathematical probability]] and [[social statistics]]. Quetelet's 1835 book, ''Essay on Social Physics: Man and the Development of his Faculties'', outlines the project of a social physics characterized by measured variables that follow a [[normal distribution]], and collected data about many such variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1v8OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Sur+l%27homme+et+le+d%C3%A9veloppement+de+ses+facult%C3%A9s,+ou+Essai+de+physique+sociale&amp;ei=gAuuS_OPJZ7WMO2TvZcM&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Sur l'homme et le Développement de ses Facultés, ou Essai de Physique Sociale|last=Quetelet|first=Adolphe|publisher=Imprimeur-Libraire|year=1835|isbn=|volume=1-2|location=Paris|pages=|language=French|trans-title=Essay on Social Physics: Man and the Development of his Faculties|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frequently repeated anecdote is that when Comte discovered that Quetelet had appropriated the term 'social physics', he found it necessary to invent a new term 'sociologie' (sociology) because he disagreed with Quetelet's collection of statistics.

There have been several “generations” of social physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iberall|first=Arthur|year=1984|orig-year=Presented at Annual Conference of the International Society for the Comparative Study of Civilizations (ISCSC), Syracuse, May 1980|title=Contributions to a Physical Science for the Study of Civilizations|journal=Journal of Social and Biological Structures|volume=7|issue=3|pages=259–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first generation began with Saint-Simon, Comte, and Quetelet, and ended with the late 1800s with historian [[Henry Adams]]. In the middle of the 20th century, researchers such as the American astrophysicist [[John Q. Stewart]] and Swedish geographer [[Reino Ajo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contributions to "Social Physics": a Programme Sketch with Special Regard to National Planning|last=Ajo|first=Reino|publisher=Royal University of Lund|year=1953|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who showed that the spatial distribution of social interactions could be described using gravity models. Physicists such as [[Arthur Iberall]] use a [[homeokinetics]] approach to study social systems as complex self-organizing systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Iberall|first=A|year=1985|title=Outlining social physics for modern societies - locating culture, economics, and politics: The Enlightenment reconsidered|journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=82|pages=5582–84|doi=10.1073/pnas.82.17.5582|pmc=390594}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Iberall|first1=A|last2=Hassler|first2=F|last3=Soodak|first3=H|last4=Wilkinson|first4=D|year=2000|title=Invitation to an Enterprise: From Physics to World History to Civilizations’ Study|journal=Comparative Civilization Review|volume=42|pages=4–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a homeokinetics analysis of society shows that one must account for flow variables such as the flow of energy, of materials, of action, reproduction rate, and value-in-exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Iberall| first=Arthur S.|title=Homeokinetics: The Basics|publisher=Strong Voices Publishing|year=2016|location=Medfield, MA|isbn=978-0-990-53614-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently there have been a large number of social science papers that use mathematics broadly similar to that of [[physics]], and described as “[[computational social science]]”.&lt;ref&gt;Lazer, D., Pentland, A., et al ''Science'' 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1800s, Adams separated “human physics” into the subsets of social physics or social mechanics (sociology of interactions using physics-like mathematical tools)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ball|first=Phillip|year=2002|orig-year=A talk presented at ‘Horizons in Complex Systems’ Messina, Sicily, Italy, 2001|title=The physical modelling of society: a historical perspective|url=http://www.if.ufrj.br/~mbr/econofisica/intro/artigos/Physica.A.314.1.2002.pdf|journal=Physica A|volume=314|issue=1-4|pages=1–14|doi=10.1016/s0378-4371(02)01042-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and social thermodynamics or sociophysics, (sociology described using mathematical invariances similar to those in [[thermodynamics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Alan|title=Notes on Some Concepts in Social Physics|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1435-5597.1969.tb01460.x/abstract|journal=Regional Science|publisher=Regional Science Association International|volume=22|issue=1|pages=159–193|doi=10.1111/j.1435-5597.1969.tb01460.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This dichotomy is roughly analogous to the difference between [[microeconomics]] and [[macroeconomics]].

==Recent work==
In modern use “social physics” refers to using “[[big data]]” analysis and the mathematical laws to understand the behavior of human crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=GEORGE|first=Gerard|last2=HAAS|first2=Martine R.|last3=PENTLAND|first3=Alex|year=2014|title=Big Data and Management: From the Editors|url=http://ink.library.smu.edu.sg/lkcsb_research/4621/|journal=Academy of Management Journal|volume=57|issue=2|pages=321–326|doi=10.5465/amj.2014.4002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core idea is that data about human activity (e.g., phone call records, credit card purchases, taxi rides, web activity) contain mathematical patterns that are characteristic of how social interactions spread and converge. These mathematical invariances can then serve as a filter for analysis of behavior changes and for detecting emerging behavioral patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/predictive-analytics/|title=Predictive Analytics|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blockchain, Cryptography, and Social Physics Applications==
Over the past few years, Social Physics has been shown to be a potent analytics tool for a variety of applications where either data is anonymized or only metadata is available, as is typical of crytographic and [[blockchain]] systems. This is because Social Physics is primarily about interactions between elements, so that the form of the data is often irrelevant.  

Following are a few examples for the use of Social Physics applied to Blockchain and Crypto systems:
* Social Physics for Financial Interaction. In a recent MIT PhD [http://people.csail.mit.edu/pkrafft/papers/krafft-thesis-final.pdf Thesis], a social physics approach to [[cryptocurrency]] market buy/sell timing was shown to drive “bubbles” in [[AltCoin|AltCoins]]. In this experiment, carefully timed investments totaling just a few dollars often drove more than 5000 times increase in AltCoin market value.
* Social Physics for breaking cryptographic anonymization. A recent ruling of the US Supreme Court cited the use of Social Physics for the efficient re-identification of cryptographically anonymized metadata (similar to [[Bitcoin]] transactions), discouraging defense agencies and private companies from collecting and using this so-called "anonymized" data&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Montjoye|first=Yves-Alexandre de|last2=Radaelli|first2=Laura|last3=Singh|first3=Vivek Kumar|last4=Pentland|first4=Alex “Sandy”|date=2015-01-30|title=Unique in the shopping mall: On the reidentifiability of credit card metadata|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6221/536|journal=Science|language=en|volume=347|issue=6221|pages=536–539|doi=10.1126/science.1256297|issn=0036-8075|pmid=25635097}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Social Physics for Anti-Money Laundering (AML). Social Physics was used to uncover a collaborating network of bitcoin addresses, an arrangement often used to launder stolen Bitcoins. This was done using a handful of known malicious addresses, that were used as “seeds” for the Social Physics “behavioral similarity detection” algorithm, resulting in an accurate detection of dozens of additional members of the network&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1003255394|title=New solutions for cybersecurity|last=|first=|publisher=|others=Shrobe, Howard E.,, Shrier, David L.,, Pentland, Alex, 1952-|year=|isbn=9780262535373|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=|chapter=11|oclc=1003255394}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Commercial use==


Most recently, research by [[Alex Pentland|Prof. Alex “Sandy” Pentland]] and [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr Yaniv Altshuler]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] has combined social physics with [[Machine learning|Machine Learning]] to improve the performance of machine learning applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.media.mit.edu/research/highlights/tuning-social-networks-gain-wisdom-crowd|title=Tuning Social Networks to Gain the Wisdom of the Crowd {{!}} MIT Media Lab|website=www.media.mit.edu|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.endor.com Endor], a company co-founded by [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr. Altshuler]], utilized social physics to introduce a predictive intelligence platform that automates the process of answering predictive business questions, using natural language&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.mit.edu/2017/endor-inventing-google-predictive-analytics-1220|title=Inventing the “Google” for predictive analytics|work=MIT News|access-date=2017-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A ICO of 50 million USD was also conducted by Endor.

In the field of [[cyber-security]], a team headed by [[Yaniv Altshuler|Dr Altshuler]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] has shown how the concept of social physics, manifested as mathematical invariances that are embedded in large datasets, can be used in order to generate new and highly efficient types of attacks on behavioral information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Altshuler|first=Yaniv|last2=Aharony|first2=Nadav|last3=Pentland|first3=Alex|last4=Elovici|first4=Yuval|last5=Cebrian|first5=Manuel|year=2011|title=Stealing Reality: When Criminals Become Data Scientists (or Vice Versa)|url=http://web.media.mit.edu/~yanival/IEEE_Intelligent_Systems.pdf|journal=IEEE Intelligent Systems|volume=26|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociology of philosophy''' is a subdivision of [[sociology]] that seeks to understand the influence of [[philosophy]] in the society, the social conditions in the intellectual activity and effects of philosophy, and the social configurations and processes of philosophical research. Sociology of philosophy, as an empirical sociological branch based on theory, was developed in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heidegren|first1=Carl-Göran|last2=Lundberg|first2=Henrik|title=Towards a Sociology of Philosophy|journal=Acta Sociologica|date=2010|volume=53|issue=1|pages=3–18|doi=10.1177/0001699309357831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12179">'''Sound studies''' is an interdisciplinary field that to date has focused largely on the emergence of the concept of "sound" in Western modernity, with an emphasis on the development of sound reproduction technologies. The field first emerged in venues like the journal ''Social Studies of Science'' by scholars working in [[science and technology studies]] and [[communication studies]]; it has however greatly expanded and now includes a broad array of scholars working in music, anthropology, [[sound art]], [[deaf studies]], [[architecture]], and many other fields besides. Important studies have focused on the idea of a "soundscape", architectural acoustics, nature sounds, the history of aurality in [[Western philosophy]] and nineteenth-century Colombia, Islamic approaches to listening, the voice, studies of deafness, loudness, and related topics. A foundational text is Jonathan Sterne's 2003 book "The Audible Past", though the field has retroactively taken as foundational two texts from 1977, [[Jacques Attali]]'s "Noise" and [[R. Murray Schafer]]'s "The Soundscape".

Initial work in the field was criticized for focusing mainly on white male inventors in Euro-America. Consequently the field is currently in a period of expansion, with important texts coming out in recent years on sound, listening, and hearing as they relate to blackness, gender, and [[colonialism]].

==Hearing and listening==

Two significant categories to what we hear and pay attention to are natural and technological sounds. According to R. Murray Schaeffer (through a survey of quotes in the literature), the proportion of nature sounds heard and noticed among European authors has decreased over the past two centuries from 43% to 20%, but not for North America, where it has stayed around 50%. Additionally, the proportion of technological sounds mentioned in literature has stayed around 35% for Europe, but decreased in North America. While technological increases have not been sonically noticed, the decrease in silence has been noticed, from 19% to 9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=R. Murray|title=The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World|date=1994|publisher=Destiny Books|location=Rochester, Vermont|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the idea of listening, objects can be considered auditorily as compared to visually. The objects that are able to be experienced by sight and by sound can be thought of in a [[venn diagram]], with mute and visible objects in the vision category, with aural and invisible objects in the sound category, and aural and visible objects in the overlapping category. Objects that do not fall into a specific category can be considered beyond the horizons of sound and sight. The common denominator for aural objects is movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ihde|first1=Don|title=Listening and Voice: A Phenomenology of Sound|date=1974|publisher=Ohio University Press|location=Athens|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three modes of listening have been recognized; causal listening, semantic listening, and reduced listening. Causal listening, the most common, consists of listening in order to gather ideas about its source. Sound in this case is informational and can be used to recognize voices, determine distance, or understand differences between humans and machines. Semantic listening is when a sound is not only heard but also processed. When a sound is given meaning and context, as seen in speech and fluent dialogue. Reduced listening focuses on the traits of the sound itself regardless of cause and meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chion|first1=Michel|title=Audio Vision: Sound on Screen|date=1990|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=48–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spaces, sites and scapes==

Sound is heard through space. But this defining of sound and space is further nuanced by their interdependent existence, creation, and dissolution. This idea of the acoustic environment and its social inextricability has become a source of interest within the field of sound studies. Critical to this contemporary discussion of the symbiotic social space and sonic space is R. Murray Schafer's concept of the soundscape. Schafer uses the term soundscape to describe "a total appreciation of the sonic environment," and, through soundscape studies, attempts to more holistically understand "the relationship between man and the sounds of his environment and what happens when those sounds change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schafer|first1=R. Murray|title=The Soundscape: Our Sonic Environment and the Tuning of the World|date=1994|publisher=Destiny Books|location=Rochester, Vermont|pages=8, 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In understanding the environment as events being heard, the soundscape is indicative of the social conditions and characteristics that create it. In industrialized cities, the soundscape is industrial noises, in a rainforest the soundscape is the sound of nature, and in an empty space the soundscape is silence. Moreover, the soundscape is argued to foretell future societal trends. The soundscape is not just representative of the environment which surrounds it but it makes up its very essence. The soundscape is the environment on a wavelength that is auditory rather than tactile or visible, but very much as real.

Schaffer's concept of the soundscape has become a hallmark of sound studies and is referenced, built upon, and criticized by writers from a wide breadth of disciplines and perspectives. Common themes explored through the analysis of the soundscape are the conflict between nature and industry, the impact of technology on sound production and consumption, the issue of cultural sound values and the evolution of acoustics, and the power dynamics of silence and noise.

==Transduce and record==

Our perception of a recorded sound's authenticity has been greatly impacted by the commercial influence of capitalism. Even the dead now profit from recordings they've made, making music more timeless than ever before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stanyek|first1=Jason|last2=Piekut|first2=Benjamin|title=Deadness: Technologies of the Intermundane|date=2010|pages=14–21 &amp; 27–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bringing the past into the present generates a sense of familiarity which compels the public to engage in new forms of listening.

In a Memorex commercial involving Ella Fitzgerald and Chuck Mangione, Fitzgerald is unable to discern the difference between a live performance and a recording of Mangione playing the trumpet. This presents a scene to viewers which sells cassette tapes as ideal objects of high-fidelity, auditory preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mowitt|first1=John|title=The Sound of Music in the Era of its Electronic Reproducibility|date=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|pages=184–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was once an autonomic experience of memory which integrated visual and auditory stimuli (live music) has become a consumable item which popularizes and commodifies sonic memory explicitly.

Part of this shift in the dynamics of recorded sound has to do with a desire for noise reduction. This desire is representative of a mode of recording referred to by scholar James Lastra as "telephonic:" a mode in which sound is regarded as having hierarchically important qualities, with clarity and intelligibility being the most important aspects. This contrasts with phonographic recording, which generates a "point of audition" from which a sense of space can be derived, sacrificing quality for uniqueness and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lastra|first1=James|title=Sound Theory. "Fidelity Versus Intelligibility"|date=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=138–143}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is often used in movies to demonstrate how a character hears something (such as muffled voices through a closed door). Through various forms of media, recorded music affects our perceptions and consumptive practices more often than we realize.

'''St. Petersburg Institute of Jewish Studies''' ({{lang-ru|Петербургский Институт Иудаики}}, also known as St. Petersburg Jewish University in 1991-1997 and Leningrad Jewish University in 1989-1991) is a private institution of higher education in the area of [[Jewish Studies]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]].

==History==
Leningrad Jewish University was established in 1989 as a continuation of the [[David Günzburg|Baron Günzburg]]'s Courses for Oriental Studies (1907-1917) and the Petrograd / Leningrad Jewish University (1919-1925). The latter was closed by the Soviet Authorities as "unnecessary" in 1925. The new Leningrad Jewish University was created in 1989 during the new Soviet policy of [[Perestroika]] by enthusiasts and Jewish Activists, Ilya Dvorkin (the first Rector of the university), Vaniamin Lukin, Khava Korzakova, and others. During its first year '89/90 only evening classes were offered of [[Hebrew]], history, [[Torah studies]], as well as seminars on [[Ethnography]], [[Linguistics]] and Local History, and several others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://berkovich-zametki.com/2008/Starina/Nomer1/MN83.htm] From the history of Jewish Higher Education in Russia&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1991, morning and day classes were offered and a four-year educational program was established, aiming to prepare Bachelors of Arts in Hebrew, history, and education. The university was officially recognized and accredited. The first alumni graduated in 1996.

In 1997 the name of the university was changed to St. Petersburg Institute of Jewish Studies. Prof. Dmitri Elyashevich became the rector of the institute in 1997, and Prof. Alexander Kobrinsky is the vice-Rector / Provost.

The institute worked at various addresses, including the Jewish Community Center of St. Petersburg and became a prominent part of the Jewish community of St. Petersburg.

==Research==
The institute is a home of a largest Jewish library in the Former Soviet Union. Several scientific conferences on Jewish education, history and other aspects of Jewish Studies were organized by the university. The journal ''Evreyskaya Shkola'' ("Jewish School" in Russian) was published in 1992-1996. The series "Trudy po Iudaike" ("The works on Jewish Studies") are published since 1993. The Institute for the Studies of Jewish Diaspora organized numerous expeditions and field trips to [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Baltic States]], the [[Central Asia]] and the [[Caucasus]]. The materials are kept in the Archive of the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pijs.ru/] St. Petersburg Institute of Jewish Studies&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computer science]], '''synchronization''' refers to one of two distinct but related concepts: synchronization of [[Process (computer science)|processes]], and synchronization of [[Dataset|data]]. ''Process synchronization'' refers to the idea that multiple processes are to join up or [[Handshaking|handshake]] at a certain point, in order to reach an agreement or commit to a certain sequence of action. ''[[Data synchronization]]'' refers to the idea of keeping multiple copies of a dataset in coherence with one another, or to maintain [[data integrity]]. Process synchronization primitives are commonly used to implement data synchronization.

== The need for synchronization ==
The need for synchronization does not arise merely in multi-processor systems but for any kind of concurrent processes; even in single processor systems. Mentioned below are some of the main needs for synchronization:

''[[Fork-join model|Forks and Joins]]:'' When a job arrives at a fork point, it is split into N sub-jobs which are then serviced by n tasks. After being serviced, each sub-job waits until all other sub-jobs are done processing. Then, they are joined again and leave the system. Thus, in parallel programming, we require synchronization as all the parallel processes wait for several other processes to occur.

''[[Producer–consumer problem|Producer-Consumer:]]'' In a producer-consumer relationship, the consumer process is dependent on the producer process till the necessary data has been produced.

''Exclusive use resources:'' When multiple processes are dependent on a resource and they need to access it at the same time the operating system needs to ensure that only one processor accesses it at a given point in time.This reduces  concurrency.

==Thread or process synchronization==
[[File:Multiple Processes Accessing the shared resource.png|thumb|'''Figure 1''': Three processes accessing a shared resource ([[critical section]]) simultaneously.]]

Thread synchronization is defined as a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent [[process (computer science)|processes]] or [[thread (computer science)|threads]] do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as [[critical section]]. Processes' access to critical section is controlled by using synchronization techniques. When one thread starts executing the [[critical section]] (serialized segment of the program) the other thread should wait until the first thread finishes. If proper synchronization techniques&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not applied, it may cause a [[race condition#Software|race condition]] where the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of [[context switch]]es of the processes or threads.

For example, suppose that there are three processes, namely 1, 2, and 3. All three of them are concurrently executing, and they need to share a common resource (critical section) as shown in Figure 1. Synchronization should be used here to avoid any conflicts for accessing this shared resource. Hence, when Process 1 and 2 both try to access that resource, it should be assigned to only one process at a time.  If it is assigned to Process 1, the other process (Process 2) needs to wait until Process 1 frees that resource (as shown in Figure 2).

[[File:Shared Resource access in synchronization environment.png|thumb|'''Figure 2''': A process accessing a shared resource if available, based on some synchronization technique.]]

Another synchronization requirement which needs to be considered is the order in which particular processes or threads should be executed. For example, we cannot board a plane until we buy a ticket.  Similarly, we cannot check e-mails without validating our credentials (i.e., user name and password). In the same way, an ATM will not provide any service until we provide it with a correct PIN.

Other than mutual exclusion, synchronization also deals with the following:
* [[deadlock]], which occurs when many processes are waiting for a shared resource (critical section) which is being held by some other process. In this case, the processes just keep waiting and execute no further;
* [[Resource starvation|starvation]], which occurs when a process is waiting to enter the critical section, but other processes monopolize the critical section, and the first process is forced to wait indefinitely;
* [[priority inversion]], which occurs when a high-priority process is in the critical section, and it is interrupted by a medium-priority process. This violation of priority rules can happen under certain circumstances and may lead to serious consequences in real-time systems;
* [[busy waiting]], which occurs when a process frequently polls to determine if it has access to a critical section. This frequent polling robs processing time from other processes.

==Minimizing synchronization==
One of the challenges for exascale algorithm design is to minimize or reduce synchronization. 
Synchronization takes more time than computation, especially in distributed computing. Reducing synchronization drew attention from computer scientists for decades. Whereas it becomes an increasingly significant problem recently as the gap between the improvement of computing and latency increases. Experiments have shown that (global) communications due to synchronization on a distributed computers takes a dominated share in a sparse iterative solver.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; for ranking the top 500 supercomputers.

===Classic problems of synchronization===
The following are some classic problems of synchronization:
* [[Producer–consumer problem|The Producer–Consumer Problem]] (also called The Bounded Buffer Problem);
* [[Readers–writers problem|The Readers–Writers Problem]];
* [[Dining philosophers problem|The Dining Philosophers Problem]].

These problems are used to test nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme or primitive.

===Hardware synchronization===
Many systems provide hardware support for [[critical section]] code.

A single processor or [[uniprocessor system]] could disable [[interrupt]]s by executing currently running code without [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]], which is very inefficient on [[Multiprocessing|multiprocessor]] systems.&lt;ref name="Wiley2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silberschatz|first1=Abraham|last2=Gagne|first2=Greg|last3=Galvin|first3=Peter Baer|title=Operating System Concepts|date=July 11, 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|isbn=978-0-470-12872-5|edition=Eighth|chapter=Chapter 6: Process Synchronization}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The key ability we require to implement synchronization in a multiprocessor is a set of hardware primitives with the ability to atomically read and modify a memory location. Without such a capability, the cost of building basic synchronization primitives will be too high and will increase as the processor count increases. There are a number of alternative formulations of the basic hardware primitives, all of which provide the ability to atomically read and modify a location, together with some way to tell if the read and write were performed atomically. These hardware primitives are the basic building blocks that are used to build a wide variety of user-level synchronization operations, including things such as [[Lock (computer science)|locks]] and [[Barrier (computer science)|barriers]]. In general, architects do not expect users to employ the basic hardware primitives, but instead expect that the primitives will be used by system programmers to build a synchronization library, a process that is often complex and tricky."&lt;ref name="Morgan2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hennessy|first1=John L.|last2=Patterson|first2=David A.|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|date=September 30, 2011|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-123-83872-8|edition=Fifth|chapter=Chapter 5: Thread-Level Parallelism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern hardware provides special atomic hardware instructions by either [[test-and-set]] the memory word or [[compare-and-swap]] contents of two memory words.

===Synchronization strategies in programming languages===
In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], to prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors, blocks of code are wrapped into '''synchronized''' ''(lock_object)'' sections. This forces any thread to acquire the said lock object before it can execute the block. The lock is automatically released when the thread which acquired the lock, and is then executing the block, leaves the block or enters the waiting state within the block. Any variable updates, made by a thread in a synchronized block, become visible to other threads when they similarly acquire the lock and execute the block.

Java ''synchronized'' blocks, in addition to enabling mutual exclusion and memory consistency,  enable signaling—i.e., sending events from threads which have acquired the lock and are executing the code block to those which are waiting for the lock within the block. This means that Java synchronized sections combine functionality of mutexes and events. Such primitive is known as [[Monitor (synchronization)|synchronization monitor]].

Any object may be used as a lock/monitor in Java. The declaring object is a lock object when the whole method is marked with ''synchronized''.

The [[.NET framework]] has synchronization primitives. "Synchronization is designed to be cooperative, demanding that every thread or process follow the synchronization mechanism before accessing protected resources (critical section) for consistent results." In .NET, locking, signaling, lightweight synchronization types, spinwait and interlocked operations are some of mechanisms related to synchronization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synchronization Primitives in .NET framework|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228964%28v=vs.110%29.aspx|website=MSDN, The Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation of Synchronization ===

==== Spinlock ====
{{Main article|Spinlock}}
Another effective way of implementing synchronization is by using spinlocks. Before accessing any shared resource or piece of code, every processor checks a flag. If the flag is reset, then the processor sets the flag and continues executing the thread. But, if the flag is set (locked), the threads would keep spinning in a loop and keep checking if the flag is set or not. But, spinlocks are effective only if the flag is reset for lower cycles otherwise it can lead to performance issues as it wastes many processor cycles waiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Embedded Software Development with ECos|last=Massa|first=Anthony|publisher=Pearson Education Inc|year=2003|isbn=0- 13-035473-2|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Barriers ====
{{Main article|Barrier (computer science)}}
Barriers are simple to implement and provide good responsiveness. They are based on the concept of implementing wait cycles to provide synchronization. Consider three threads running simultaneously, starting from barrier 1. After time t, thread1 reaches barrier 2 but it still has to wait for thread 2 and 3 to reach barrier2 as it does not have the correct data. Once all the threads reach barrier 2 they all start again. After time t, thread 1 reaches barrier3 but it will have to wait for threads 2 and 3 and the correct data again.

Thus, in barrier synchronization of multiple threads there will always be a few threads that will end up waiting for other threads as in the above example thread 1 keeps waiting for thread 2 and 3. This results in severe degradation of the process performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meng, Chen, Pan, Yao, Wu|first=Jinglei, Tianzhou, Ping, Jun. Minghui|date=2014|title=A speculative mechanism for barrier sychronization|url=|journal=2014 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC), 2014 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Cyberspace Safety and Security (CSS) and 2014 IEEE 11th International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems (ICESS)|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barrier synchronization wait function for i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; thread can be represented as:

(Wbarrier)i = f ((Tbarrier)i, (Rthread)i)

Where Wbarrier is the wait time for a thread, Tbarrier is the number of threads has arrived, and Rthread is the arrival rate of threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M. M.|first=Rahman|date=2012|title=Process synchronization in multiprocessor and multi-core processor|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6317471&amp;isnumber=6317321|journal=Informatics, Electronics &amp; Vision (ICIEV), 2012 International Conference|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317471|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments show that 34% of the total execution time is spent in waiting for other slower threads.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Semaphores ====
{{Main article|Semaphore (programming)}}
Semaphores are signalling mechanisms which can allow one or more threads/processors to access a section. A Semaphore has a flag which has a certain fixed value associated with it and each time a thread wishes to access the section, it decrements the flag. Similarly, when the thread leaves the section, the flag is incremented. If the flag is zero, the thread cannot access the section and gets blocked if it chooses to wait.

Some semaphores would allow only one thread or process in the code section. Such Semaphores are called binary semaphore and are very similar to Mutex. Here, if the value of semaphore is 1, the thread is allowed to access and if the value is 0, the access is denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems|last=Li, Yao|first=Qing, Carolyn|publisher=CMP Books|year=2003|isbn=1578201241|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical foundations ===
Synchronization was originally a process-based concept whereby a lock could be obtained on an object. Its primary usage was in databases. There are two types of (file) [[File locking|lock]]; read-only and read–write. Read-only locks may be obtained by many processes or threads. Readers–writer locks are exclusive, as they may only be used by a single process/thread at a time.

Although locks were derived for file databases, data is also shared in memory between processes and threads. Sometimes more than one object (or file) is locked at a time. If they are not locked simultaneously they can overlap, causing a deadlock exception.

[[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] only have exclusive locks because they are thread based and rely on the [[compare-and-swap]] processor instruction.

An abstract mathematical foundation for synchronization primitives is given by the [[history monoid]]. There are also many higher-level theoretical devices, such as [[process calculi]] and [[Petri net]]s, which can be built on top of the history monoid.

===Synchronization examples===
Following are some synchronization examples with respect to different platforms.&lt;ref name="Wiley2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silberschatz|first1=Abraham|last2=Gagne|first2=Greg|last3=Galvin|first3=Peter Baer|title=Operating System Concepts|date=December 7, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|isbn=978-1-118-06333-0|edition=Ninth|chapter=Chapter 5: Process Synchronization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Synchronization in Windows====
[[Windows]] provides:
* [[Interrupt|interrupt masks]], which protect access to global resources (critical section) on uniprocessor systems;
* [[spinlock]]s, which prevent, in multiprocessor systems, spinlocking-thread from being preempted;
* [[dispatcher]]s, which act like [[mutual exclusion|mutex]]es, [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], [[Event (computing)|event]]s, and [[timer]]s.

====Synchronization in Linux====
[[Linux]] provides:
* [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]];
* [[spinlock]];
* [[barrier (computer science)|barrier]]s
* [[mutual exclusion|mutex]]
* [[readers–writer lock]]s, for the longer section of codes which are accessed very frequently but don't change very often.
* [[Read-copy-update]] (RCU) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/262464/|title=What is RCU, Fundamentally? [LWN.net]|author=|date=|website=lwn.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enabling and disabling of kernel preemption replaced spinlocks on uniprocessor systems. Prior to kernel version 2.6, [[Linux]] disabled interrupt to implement short critical sections. Since version 2.6 and later, Linux is fully preemptive.

====Synchronization in Solaris====
[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] provides:
* [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]];
* [[condition variable]]s;
* [[adaptive mutex]]es, binary semaphores that are implemented differently depending upon the conditions;
* readers–writer locks:
* [[turnstiles]], queue of threads which are waiting on acquired lock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-08-1999/swol-08-insidesolaris.html|title=Turnstiles and priority inheritance - SunWorld - August 1999|first=Jim|last=Mauro|date=|website=sunsite.uakom.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pthreads synchronization====
[[Pthreads]] is a platform-independent [[API]] that provides:
* mutexes;
* condition variables;
* readers–writer locks;
* spinlocks;
* [[barrier (computer science)|barrier]]s.

==Data synchronization ==
{{main article|Data synchronization}}
[[File:Data Synchronization.png|thumb|'''Figure 3: '''Changes from both server and client(s) are synchronized.]]

A distinctly different (but related) concept is that of [[data synchronization]]. This refers to the need to keep multiple copies of a set of data coherent with one another or to maintain [[data integrity]], Figure 3. For example, database replication is used to keep multiple copies of data synchronized with database servers that store data in different locations.

Examples include:
* [[File synchronization]], such as syncing a hand-held MP3 player to a desktop computer;
* [[Cluster file system]]s, which are [[file system]]s that maintain data or indexes in a coherent fashion across a whole [[computing cluster]];
* [[Cache coherency]], maintaining multiple copies of data in sync across multiple [[cache (computing)|cache]]s;
* [[RAID]], where data is written in a redundant fashion across multiple disks, so that the loss of any one disk does not lead to a loss of data;
* [[Database replication]], where copies of data on a [[database]] are kept in sync, despite possible large geographical separation;
* [[Journaling file system|Journaling]], a technique used by many modern file systems to make sure that file metadata are updated on a disk in a coherent, consistent manner.

===Challenges in data synchronization===
Some of the challenges which user may face in data synchronization:
* data formats complexity;
* real-timeliness;
* data security;
* data quality;
* performance.

==== Data formats complexity ====
Data formats tend to grow more complex with time as the organization grows and evolves. This results not only in building simple interfaces between the two applications (source and target), but also in a need to transform the data while passing them to the target application. [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] (extraction transformation loading) tools can be helpful at this stage for managing data format complexities.

====Real-timeliness====
In real-time systems, customers want to see the current status of their order in e-shop, the current status of a parcel delivery—a real time parcel tracking—, the current balance on their account, etc. This shows the need of a real-time system, which is being updated as well to enable smooth manufacturing process in real-time, e.g., ordering material when enterprise is running out stock, synchronizing customer orders with manufacturing process, etc. From real life, there exist so many examples where real-time processing gives successful and competitive advantage.

====Data security====
There are no fixed rules and policies to enforce data security. It may vary depending on the system which you are using. Even though the security is maintained correctly in the source system which captures the data, the security and information access privileges must be enforced on the target systems as well to prevent any potential misuse of the information. This is a serious issue and particularly when it comes for handling secret, confidential and personal information. So because of the sensitivity and confidentiality, data transfer and all in-between information must be encrypted.

====Data quality====
Data quality is another serious constraint. For better management and to maintain good quality of data, the common practice is to store the data at one location and share with different people and different systems and/or applications from different locations. It helps in preventing inconsistencies in the data.

====Performance====  
There are five different phases involved in the data synchronization process:
* [[data extraction]] from the source (or master, or main) system;
* [[data transfer]];
* [[data transformation]];
* data load to the target system.
* data updation

Each of these steps is critical. In case of large amounts of data, the synchronization process needs to be carefully planned and executed to avoid any negative impact on performance.

'''''The Historical Novel''''' is a 1924 book by [[Herbert Butterfield]]. It originated in an undergraduate essay and gained the Le Bas Prize for Butterfield. It was originally published by [[Cambridge University Press]], one of the conditions for the prize.

==Summary==
The work was Butterfield's first publication. It developed from the embryo of a paper, presented to the Peterhouse History Society in the Michaelmas term, which he then expanded.

It examines the relationship between the form of the [[Historical fiction#Historical novel|historical novel]] on the one hand and the formal study of history on the other. It explores the style of historical fictions, the way in which they engage with evidence (and how that differs from the orthodox [[historical method]]) and the extent to which such a form of writing affects mainstream historical scholarship itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Historical Novel|url=http://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/history/regional-and-world-history-general-interest/historical-novel-essay|website=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butterfield sees the historical novel as a form which is a kind of 'fusion' of other styles and approaches. In particular, he sees a potential in it for a form of historical empathy that can provide deep insights into the motivations behind the actions of historical protagonists such as [[Napoleon]]; it can also be used to marshall a sense of nationalistic or patriot feeling becoming, itself, a "maker of history" rather than merely a reflector or mirror of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Groot|first1=Jerome|title=The Historical Novel|date=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=113525320X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=82avWVrVeukC&amp;pg=PT3&amp;lpg=PT3&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Fq9dzFHgBi&amp;sig=VSrtwqcq63ddSQzblX0xd-Z_smw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ftXTU-HTH-zZ0QWA5YCgAQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of its purposes, according to Butterfield, was to help us 'feel' a particular epoch of the past in ways in which traditional historical writing might not because of the different role and importance of the imagination in the case of the historical novel. Another important element of historical fiction for Butterfield was its role in bringing to light the existence of uncertainty in human affairs as lived by real people: the historian, in his view, tends to have a retrospective reach which draws out trajectories and processes over time, but the characters in a historical novel live as real human beings do, being only aware of probabilities and potential situations rather than knowing precisely where certain events and phenomena are headed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowenthal|first1=David|title=The Past is a Foreign Country|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521294800|pages=226–227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jMqsAQZmv5IC&amp;pg=PA226&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=G9jTU_bFBcOV7AbymYFw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work did not display Butterfield's later detestation of the form of the historical novel; later on, moreover, he referred to the arguments in his first publication in disparaging terms, arguing that it was 'a bad book'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Michael|title=The Life and Thought of Herbert Butterfield: History, Science and God|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=1139502859|pages=45–6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c1r2DMbwZegC&amp;pg=PT52&amp;dq=%22Historical+Novel%22+Butterfield&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=sNbTU86WN8_H7AaE_ID4CA&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Historical%20Novel%22%20Butterfield&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematical or [[statistical model|statistical mode]]ling a '''threshold model''' is any model where a threshold value, or set of threshold values, is used to distinguish ranges of values where the behaviour predicted by the model varies in some important way. A particularly important instance arises in toxicology, where the model for the effect of a drug may be that there is zero effect for a dose below a critical or threshold value, while an effect of some significance exists above that value.&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;Dodge, Y. (2003) ''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-850994-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain types of regression model may include threshold effects.&lt;ref name=Dodge/&gt;

== Collective Behavior ==
Threshold models are often used to model the behavior of groups, ranging from social insects to animal herds to human society.

Classic threshold models were developed by Schelling, Axelrod, and [[Mark Granovetter|Granovetter]] to model [[collective behavior]]. Schelling attempted to model the dynamics of segregation  motivated by individual interactions in America (Schelling, 1971) by constructing two simulation models. Schelling demonstrated that “there is no simple correspondence of individual incentive to collective results,” and that the dynamics of movement influenced patterns of segregation. In doing so Schelling highlighted the significance of “a general theory of ‘tipping’”.

Mark Granovetter, following Schelling, proposed the threshold model (Granovetter &amp; Soong, 1983, 1986, 1988), which assumes that individuals’ behavior depends on the number of other individuals already engaging in that behavior (both Schelling and Granovetter classify their term of “threshold” as behavioral threshold.). He used the threshold model to explain the riot, residential segregation, and the spiral of silence. In the spirit of Granovetter’s threshold model, the “threshold” is “the number or proportion of others who must make one decision before a given actor does so”. 
It is necessary to emphasize the determinants of threshold. Different individuals have different thresholds. Individuals' thresholds may be influenced by many factors: social economic status, education, age, personality, etc. Further, Granovetter relates “threshold” with utility one gets from participating in collective behavior or not, using the utility function, each individual will calculate his or her cost and benefit from undertaking an action. And situation may change the cost and benefit of the behavior, so threshold is situation-specific.
The distribution of the thresholds determines the outcome of the aggregate behavior (for example, public opinion).

==Segmented Regression analysis==

The models used in [[segmented regression analysis]] are threshold models.

==Fractals==

Certain deterministic recursive multivariate models which include threshold effects have been shown to produce [[fractal]] effects.&lt;ref name=Tong&gt;Tong, H. (1990) ''Non-linear Time Series: A Dynamical System Approach'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-852224-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time series analysis==

Several classes of [[nonlinear]] [[autoregressive]] models formulated for [[time series]] applications have been threshold models.&lt;ref name=Tong/&gt;

==Toxicology==
A threshold model used in [[toxicology]] posits that anything above a certain dose of a [[toxin]] is dangerous, and anything below it safe. This model is usually applied to non-[[carcinogen]]ic health hazards.

Edward J. Calabrese and Linda A. Baldwin wrote:

:The threshold dose-response model is widely viewed as the most dominant model in toxicology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Calabrese | first1 = E.J. | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = L.A. | year = 2003 | title = The Hormetic Dose-Response Model Is More Common than the Threshold Model in Toxicology | url = http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/71/2/246 | journal = [[Toxicological Sciences]] | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 246–250 | doi=10.1093/toxsci/71.2.246}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative type of model in toxicology is the [[linear no-threshold model]] (LNT), while [[hormesis]] correspond to the existence of opposite effects at low vs. high dose, which usually gives a U- or inverted U-shaped dose response curve.

== Liability threshold model ==

The '''liability-threshold model''' is a threshold model of categorical (usually binary) outcomes in which a large number of variables are summed to yield an overall 'liability' score; the observed outcome is determined by whether the [[latent variable|latent]] score is smaller or larger than the threshold. The liability-threshold model is frequently employed in medicine and genetics to model risk factors contributing to disease.

In a genetic context, the variables are all the genes and different environmental conditions, which protect against or increase the risk of a disease, and the threshold ''z'' is the biological limit past which disease develops. The threshold can be estimated from population prevalence of the disease (which is usually low). Because the threshold is defined relative to the population &amp; environment, the liability score is generally considered as a N(0, 1) [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] [[random variable]].

Early genetics models were developed to deal with very rare genetic diseases by treating them as [[Mendelian disease]]s caused by 1 or 2 genes: the presence or absence of the gene corresponds to the presence or absence of the disease, and the occurrence of the disease will follow predictable patterns within families. Continuous traits like height or intelligence could be modeled as [[normal distribution]]s, influenced by a large number of genes, and the heritability and effects of selection easily analyzed. Some diseases, like alcoholism, epilepsy, or [[Schizophrenia#Genetic|schizophrenia]], cannot be Mendelian diseases because they are common; do not appear in Mendelian ratios; respond slowly to selection against them; often occur in families with no prior history of that disease; however, relatives and adoptees of someone with that disease are far more likely (but not certain) to develop it, indicating a strong genetic component. The liability threshold model was developed to deal with these non-Mendelian binary cases; the model proposes that there is a continuous normally-distributed trait expressing risk polygenically influenced by many genes, which all individuals above a certain value develop the disease and all below it do not.

The first threshold models in genetics were introduced by [[Sewall Wright]], examining the propensity of [[guinea pig]] strains to have an extra hind toe, a phenomenon which could not be explained as a dominant or recessive gene, or continuous "blinding inheritance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1208511/pdf/506.pdf | pmc=1208511 | pmid=17246735 | volume=19 | title=An Analysis of Variability in Number of Digits in an Inbred Strain of Guinea Pigs | journal=Genetics | pages=506–36 | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1208512/pdf/537.pdf | pmc=1208512 | pmid=17246736 | volume=19 | title=The Results of Crosses between Inbred Strains of Guinea Pigs, Differing in Number of Digits | journal=Genetics | pages=537–51 | last1 = Wright | first1 = S | year=1934b}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern liability-threshold model was introduced into human research by geneticist [[Douglas Scott Falconer]] in his textbook&lt;ref&gt;ch18, "Threshold characters", [https://archive.org/details/introductiontoq00falc ''Introduction to Quantitative Genetics''], Falconer 1960&lt;/ref&gt; and two papers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1965-falconer.pdf "The inheritance of liability to certain diseases, estimated from the incidence among relatives"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815214451/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1965-falconer.pdf |date=2016-08-15 }}, Falconer 1965&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1967-falconer.pdf "The inheritance of liability to diseases with variable age of onset, with particular reference to diabetes mellitus"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815203446/https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/182368464/1967-falconer.pdf |date=2016-08-15 }}, Falconer 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Falconer had been asked about the topic of modeling 'threshold characters' by [[Cyril Clarke]] who had [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genetics.org/content/167/4/1529 "D. S. Falconer and ''Introduction to Quantitative Genetics''"], Hill &amp; Mackay 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

An early application of liability-threshold models was to schizophrenia by [[Irving Gottesman]] &amp; James Shields, finding substantial heritability &amp; little shared-environment influence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC335617/pdf/pnas00677-0218.pdf | pmc=335617 | pmid=5231600 | volume=58 | title=A polygenic theory of schizophrenia | journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | pages=199–205 | last1 = Gottesman | first1 = II | last2 = Shields | first2 = J | doi=10.1073/pnas.58.1.199 | year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; and undermining the "cold mother" theory of schizophrenia.

'''Transport economics''' is a branch of economics founded in 1959 by American economist [[John R. Meyer]] that deals with the [[resource allocation|allocation of resources]] within the transport sector. It has strong links to civil engineering. Transport economics differs from some other branches of economics in that the assumption of a spaceless, instantaneous economy does not hold. People and goods flow over networks at certain speeds. its a Demands peak.  Advance ticket purchase is often induced by lower fares.  The networks themselves may or may not be competitive. A single trip (the final good, in the consumer's eyes) may require the bundling of services provided by several firms, agencies and modes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.civilengineerbuddy.com/transportation-economics-an-introduction-transportation-engineering/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although transport systems follow the same [[supply and demand]] theory as other industries, the complications of [[network effect]]s and choices between dissimilar goods (e.g. car and bus travel) make estimating the demand for transportation facilities difficult. The development of models to estimate the likely choices between the goods involved in transport decisions ([[discrete choice]] models) led to the development of an important branch of [[&lt;big&gt;economics]]


In transport, [[Demand (economics)|demand]] can be measured in number of journeys made or in total distance traveled across all journeys (e.g. [[passenger-kilometer]]s for public transport or vehicle-kilometers of travel (VKT) for [[private transport]]). [[Supply (economics)|Supply]] is considered to be a measure of capacity. The price of the good (travel) is measured using the [[generalised cost]] of travel, which includes both money and time expenditure.

The effect of increases in supply (i.e. capacity) are of particular interest in transport economics (see [[induced demand]]), as the potential environmental consequences are significant (see ''externalities'' below).

== Externalities ==
In addition to providing benefits to their users, transport networks impose both [[positive externalities|positive]] and [[negative externalities]] on non-users. The consideration of these externalities – particularly the negative ones – is a part of transport economics.

Positive externalities of transport networks may include the ability to provide [[emergency services]], increases in land value, and [[economies of agglomeration|agglomeration benefits]]. Negative externalities are wide-ranging and may include local air pollution, [[noise pollution]], [[light pollution]], [[traffic safety|safety hazards]], [[:wikt:severance|community severance]] and [[traffic congestion|congestion]]. The contribution of transport systems to potentially hazardous [[climate change]] is a significant negative externality which is difficult to evaluate quantitatively, making it difficult (but not impossible) to include in transport economics-based research and analysis.

Congestion is considered a negative [[externality]] by economists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Small | first = Kenneth A. | last2 = José A. Gomez-Ibañez | year = 1998 | title = Road Pricing for Congestion Management: The Transition from Theory to Policy| publisher = The University of California Transportation Center, University of California at Berkeley| pages = 213 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to third party, often, although not necessarily, from the use of a [[public good]]. For example, manufacturing or transportation cause air pollution imposing costs on others when making use of public air.

=== Traffic congestion ===
{{main|Traffic congestion}}
[[Image:I-80 Eastshore Fwy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Typical traffic congestion in an urban freeway. Shown here is [[Interstate 80|I-80]] [[Eastshore Freeway]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California.]]

Traffic congestion is a negative externality caused by various factors. A 2005 American study stated that there are seven root causes of congestion, and gives the following summary of their contributions: bottlenecks 40%, traffic incidents 25%, bad weather 15%, work zones 10%, poor signal timing 5%, and special events/other 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traffic Congestion and Reliability: Trends and Advanced Strategies for Congestion Mitigation|date=1 September 2005|url=http://www.ops.fhwa.dot.gov/congestion_report/congestion_report_05.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=U.S. Federal Highway Administration|accessdate=2008-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the transport economics community, [[congestion pricing]] is considered to be an appropriate mechanism to deal with this problem (i.e. to internalise the externality) by allocating scarce roadway capacity to users. Capacity expansion is also a potential mechanism to deal with traffic congestion, but is often undesirable (particularly in urban areas) and sometimes has questionable benefits (see [[induced demand]]). [[William Vickrey]], winner of the 1996 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]] for his work on "[[moral hazard]]", is considered one of the fathers of congestion pricing, as he first proposed it for the [[New York City Subway]] in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= Vickrey, William | year=1992|url=http://www.vtpi.org/vickrey.htm|title= Principles of Efficient Congestion Pricing|accessdate=2008-02-26|publisher = Victoria Transport Policy Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the road transportation arena these theories were extended by [[Maurice Allais]], a fellow Nobel prize winner "for his pioneering contributions to the theory of markets and efficient utilization of resources", [[Gabriel Roth (economist)|Gabriel Roth]] who was instrumental in the first designs and upon whose [[World Bank]] recommendation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Walters | first = A.

[[Reuben Smeed]], the deputy director of the [[Transport Research Laboratory|Transport and Road Research Laboratory]] was also a pioneer in this field, and his ideas were presented to the British government in what is known as the [[Smeed Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smeed, |first=R.J. |year=1964 |title=Road pricing: the economic and technical possibilities |publisher=HMSO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Congestion is not limited to road networks; the negative externality imposed by congestion is also important in busy public transport networks as well as crowded pedestrian areas, e.g. on the London Underground on a weekday or any urban train station, at peak times. There is the classical excess in demand compared to supply. This is because at peak times there is a large demand for trains, since people want to go home (i.e., a derived demand). However, space on the platforms and on the trains is limited and small compared to the demand for it. As a result, there are crowds of people outside the train doors and in the train station corridors. This increases delays for commuters, which can often cause a rise in stress or other problems.

Congestion pricing is an [[Pareto efficiency|efficiency pricing]] strategy that requires the users to pay more for that public good, thus increasing the welfare gain or net benefit for society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Button | first = Kenneth J. | year = 1993 | title = op. cit| pages = 153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Small, Kenneth A. |author2=Verhoef, Erik T. | title = op. cit| year = 2007| pages = 120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congestion pricing is one of a number of alternative [[Supply and demand|demand side]] (as opposed to [[supply side]]) strategies offered by economists to address congestion.&lt;ref name="prm_winter_1995"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Congestion Control and Demand Management |author1=Sheldon G.

=== Pollution pricing ===

Since January 2008, [[Milan]] introduced a [[congestion pricing|traffic charge]] scheme as a one-year trial, called [[Ecopass]], that exempts higher emission standard vehicles ([[Euro IV]]) and other [[alternative fuel vehicle]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/27/automobiles/27GREEN.html  | title=Toll Discounts for Going Green  | author = Ken Belson | date=27 January 2008 | publisher =The New York Times  | accessdate=2008-01-27| language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;.{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7167992.stm  | title=Milan introduces traffic charge  | date=2 March 2008 | publisher = BBC News | accessdate=2008-01-17| language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.nysun.com/article/68854  | title= Milan Introduces Congestion Charge To Cut Pollution | author = Marco Bertacche | date=3 January 2008 | publisher = The New York Sun | accessdate=2008-01-17| language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later during the year the Ecopass was extended until 31 December 2009.&lt;ref name="Milano2009"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comune.milano.it/dseserver/webcity/comunicati.nsf/weball/077F561DB4A21D98C125752F004CDE33 | title=Ecopass.

Even the transport economists who advocate congestion pricing have anticipated several practical limitations, concerns and controversial issues regarding the actual implementation of this policy. As summarized by [[Robert Cervero]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Cervero | first = Robert | authorlink=Robert Cervero|year = 1998 | title = The Transit Metropolis | publisher = Island Press, Washington, D.C. | isbn = 1-55963-591-6  &lt;!--"Setting the prices right"--&gt;| pages = 67–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; "True social-cost pricing of metropolitan travel has proven to be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real-world implementation. The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists, few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak-period travel. Middle-class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars, and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury. In the United States, few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing in fear of reprisal from their constituents... Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy, pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered. It is for all these reasons that peak-periord pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many."

==== Road space rationing ====
{{main|Road space rationing}}
[[Image:Traffic jam Sao Paulo 09 2006 30.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Traffic congestion persists in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]], despite no-drive days based on license numbers.]]

Transport economists consider [[road space rationing]] an alternative to congestion pricing, but road space rationing is considered more equitable, as the restrictions force all drivers to reduce auto travel, while congestion pricing restrains less those who can afford paying the congestion charge. Nevertheless, high-income users can avoid the restrictions by owning a second car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author= Victoria Transport Policy Institute| url=http://www.vtpi.org/tdm/tdm33.htm |title=Vehicle Restrictions. Limiting Automobile Travel at Certain Times and Places |publisher= TDM Encyclopedia|accessdate=2008-04-09|language= }} See Equity Impacts section&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, congestion pricing (unlike rationing) acts "to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evinced by users' willingness to pay for the resource". While some "opponents of congestion pricing fear that tolled roads will be used only by people with high income. But preliminary evidence suggests that the new toll lanes in California are used by people of all income groups. The ability to get somewhere fast and reliably is valued in a variety of circumstances. Not everyone will need or want to incur a toll on a daily basis, but on occasions when getting somewhere quickly is necessary, the option of paying to save time is valuable to people at all income levels." Road space rationing based on license numbers has been implemented in cities such as [[Athens]] (1982),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leda.ils.nrw.de/database/measures/meas0205.htm|title=LEDA Measure: License plate based traffic restrictions, Athens, Greece|publisher=LEDA database|accessdate=2008-04-09|language=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227030125/http://www.leda.ils.nrw.de/database/measures/meas0205.htm|archivedate=27 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[México City]] (1989), [[São Paulo]] (1997), [[Santiago de Chile|Santiago]], [[Chile]], [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]], La Paz (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.boliviahoy.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3150 | title=Los choferes públicos acataron la restricción | date=7 January 2003 | publisher=La Prensa | accessdate=2008-04-09 | language=Spanish | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213053528/http://www.boliviahoy.com/modules/news/article.php?storyid=3150 | archive-date=13 December 2006 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bolivia]], and [[San José de Costa Rica|San José]] (2005),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2005/agosto/03/pais0.html | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515152117/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2005/agosto/03/pais0.html | dead-url=yes | archive-date=15 May 2016 | title=Hoy empieza restricción para autos en centro de San José | author=Ángela Ávalos | date=3 August 2005 | publisher=La Nación | accessdate=2008-04-08 | language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/abril/12/pais2.html | title=Evaluarán restricción vehicular en capital | author=Mercedes Agüero | date=12 April 2006 | publisher=La Nación | accessdate=2008-04-08 | language=Spanish | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919101624/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2006/abril/12/pais2.html | archivedate=19 September 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Costa Rica]].

==== Tradable mobility credits ====
A more acceptable policy on automobile travel restrictions, proposed by transport economists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = Verhoef E, [[Peter Nijkamp|Nijkamp P]], Rietveld P | url = http://www.envplan.com/abstract.cgi?id=b240527 | year = 1997 | title = Tradeable permits: their potential in the regulation of road transport externalities | publisher = Environment and Planning B: Planning and Design 24(4) 527–548 |accessdate=2008-04-11  |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid inequality and revenue allocation issues, is to implement a [[rationing]] of peak period travel but through revenue-neutral credit-based congestion pricing. This concept is similar to the existing system of [[emissions trading]] of [[carbon credit]]s, proposed by the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to curb [[greenhouse emissions]]. Metropolitan area or city residents, or the taxpayers, will have the option to use the local government-issued mobility rights or congestion credits for themselves, or to trade or sell them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond the personal quota. This trading system will allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak-hour travel rather than the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author = José M.

== Funding and financing ==
Methods of funding and financing transport network maintenance, improvement and expansion are debated extensively and form part of the transport economics field.

Funding issues relate to the ways in which money is raised for the supply of transport capacity. Taxation and [[user fees]] are the main methods of fund-raising. Taxation may be general (e.g. [[income tax]]), local (e.g. [[sales tax]] or [[land value tax]]) or variable (e.g. [[fuel tax]]), and user fees may be tolls, congestion charges or fares). The method of funding often attracts strong political and public debate.

Financing issues relate to the way in which these funds are used to pay for the supply of transport. Loans, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]], [[public–private partnership]]s and concessions are all methods of financing transport investment.

== Regulation and competition ==
Regulation of the supply of transport capacity relates to both safety regulation and [[regulatory economics|economic regulation]]. Transport economics considers issues of the economic regulation of the supply of transport, particularly in relation to whether transport services and networks are provided by the public sector, by the private sector, or a mixture of both.

Transport networks and services can take on any combination of regulated/deregulated and public/private provision. For example, bus services in the UK outside London are provided by both the public and private sectors in a deregulated economic environment (where no-one specifies which services are to be provided, so the provision of services is influenced by the [[Market (economics)|market]]), whereas bus services within London are provided by the private sector in a regulated economic environment (where the public sector specifies the services to be provided and the private sector competes for the right to supply those services – i.e. [[franchising]]).

The regulation of public transport is often designed to achieve some social, geographic and temporal equity as market forces might otherwise lead to services being limited to the most popular travel times along the most densely settled corridors of development.  National, regional or municipal taxes are often deployed to provide a network that is socially acceptable (e.g. extending timetables through the daytime, weekend, holiday or evening periods and intensifying the mesh of routes beyond that which a lightly regulated market would probably provide).

Franchising may be used to create a supply of transport that balances the free-market supply outcome and the most socially desirable supply outcome.

== Project appraisal and evaluation ==
The most sophisticated methods of project appraisal and evaluation have been developed and applied in the transport sector. It should be noted that the terms 'appraisal' and 'evaluation' are often confused in relation to the assessment of projects. Appraisal refers to ''ex ante'' (before the event) assessment and evaluation refers to ''ex post'' (after the event) assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Book, Appraisal and evaluation in central government |url=http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/economic_data_and_tools/greenbook/data_greenbook_index.cfm |publisher=HM Treasury 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appraisal===

The appraisal of changes in the transport network is one of the most important applications of transport economics. In order to make an assessment of whether any given transport project should be carried out, transport economics can be used to compare the costs of the project with its benefits (both social and financial). Such an assessment is known as a [[cost-benefit analysis]], and is usually a fundamental piece of information for decision-makers, as it places a value on the net benefits (or disbenefits) of schemes and generates a ratio of benefits to costs which may be used to prioritise projects when funding is constrained.

A primary difficulty in project appraisal is the [[value of time|valuation of time]]. Travel time savings are often cited as a key benefit of transport projects, but people in different occupations, carrying out different activities and in different social classes value time differently.

Appraising projects on the basis of their supposed reductions in travel times has come under scrutiny in recent years with the recognition that improvements in capacity generate trips that would not have been made ([[induced demand]]), partially eroding the benefits of reduced travel times. Therefore, an alternative method of appraisal is to measure changes in [[land (economics)|land value]] and consumer benefits from a transport project rather than the measuring benefits accruing to travellers themselves. However, this method of analysis is much more difficult to carry out.

Another problem is that many transport projects have impacts that cannot be expressed in monetary terms, such as impacts on, for example, local air quality, biodiversity and community severance. Whilst these impacts can be included in a detailed [[environmental impact assessment]], a key issue has been how to present these assessments alongside estimates of those costs and benefits that can be expressed in monetary terms. Recent developments in transport appraisal practice in some European countries have seen the application of [[multi-criteria decision analysis]] based decision support tools. These build on existing [[cost-benefit analysis]] and environmental impact assessment techniques and help decision makers weigh up the monetary and non-monetary impacts of transport projects. In the UK, one such application, the [[New Approach to Appraisal]] has become a cornerstone of UK transport appraisal.

===Evaluation===

The evaluation of projects enables decision makers to understand whether the benefits and costs that were estimated in the appraisal materialised. Successful project evaluation requires that the necessary data to carry out the evaluation is specified in advance of carrying out the appraisal.

The appraisal and evaluation of projects form stages within a broader policy making cycle that includes:
* identifying a rationale for a project
* specifying objectives
* appraisal
* monitoring implementation of a project
* evaluation
* feedback to inform future projects

==Social effects on poverty==
In the US those with low income living in cities face a problem called “poverty transportation.” The problem arises because many of the entry level jobs which are sought out by those with little education are typically located in suburban areas. Those jobs are also not very accessible by public transportation because the transportation was often designed to move people around cities, which becomes a problem when the jobs are no longer located in the cities. Those who cannot afford cars inevitably suffer the worst, because they have no choice but to rely on public transport. The problem is illustrated by an estimation that 70% of entry level jobs are located in the suburbs, while only 32% of those jobs are within a quarter mile of public transportation.&lt;ref name="SanchezThomas"&gt;Sanchez, Thomas. ''Poverty, policy, and public transportation
''. Department of City &amp; Metropolitan Planning, University of Utah, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; More difficult (or more expensive) access to jobs and other goods &amp; services can act as a [[ghetto tax]].

As a result of the transportation systems in use, but not adequately meeting the needs of those who rely on them, they tend to generate low revenue. And with minimal revenue or funding the transportation systems are forced to decrease service and increase fares, which causes those in poverty to face more inequality. Further those who live in cities with no public transportation become even more excluded from education and work. In places with no public transport a car is the only viable option and that creates unnecessary strain on the roads and environment.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Spencer. ''The Social Inequality of Public Transit
'' 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since automobile use tends to be greater than public transportation use, it also becomes the norm for people to work towards car ownership. Private car ownership has led to a large allocation of resources towards road and bridge maintenance. But underfunding of public transportation prevents everyone who needs transportation from having access to it. And those who can choose between public transportation and private transportation will choose private transportation rather than face the inconveniences of public transportation. The lack of customers willing to use public transport creates a cycle that ultimately never leads to the transportation systems making significant progress.&lt;ref&gt;Colby, Greg. ''Urban Sprawl, Auto Dependency and Poverty
''.&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for low private vehicle ownership among welfare recipients are the established asset limitations. In the U.S. the asset limit is $1000 per vehicle. This forces welfare recipients to purchase old and sub standard vehicles in order not to lose their welfare funding.&lt;ref name="SanchezThomas" /&gt;

There are a number of ways in which public transportation could be improved and for it to become a better and more enticing option for other people who do not necessarily depend on it. Some of these include creating networks of overlapping routes even among different operators to give people more choice in where and how they want to go somewhere. The system should also function as a whole, to prevent drivers from dangerously racing along routes to increase profit. Providing incentives to use public transportation can also be beneficial, as ridership increases the transportation systems can appropriately respond by increasing the frequency along those transportation routes. Even creating bus only lanes or priority lanes at intersections could improve service and speed.&lt;ref&gt;Munoz, Juan and Grange, Louis. ''On the development of public transit in large cities
''. Department of Transport Engineering and Logistics, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments done in Africa (Uganda and Tanzania) and Sri Lanka on hundreds of households have shown that a bicycle can increase the income of a poor family by as much as 35%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bicyclepotential.org/&lt;/ref&gt;]. Transport, if analyzed for the cost-benefit analysis for rural poverty alleviation, has given one of the best returns in this regard. For example, road investments in India were a staggering 3–10 times more effective than almost all other investments and subsidies in rural economy in the decade of the 1990s. What a road does at a macro level to increase transport, the bicycle supports at the micro level. Bicycle, in that sense, can be one of the best means to eradicate the poverty in poor nations.

==Car taxation==
Car taxation is an instrument to influence the purchase decisions of consumers. Taxes can be differentiated to support the market introduction of fuel efficient and low [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emitting cars.

The European Union Commission has made a proposal for a Council Directive on passenger car taxation which is currently before the Council and Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/governance/impact/docs/ia_2005_2/COM_2005_0261_F_EN.pdf COM(2005) 261, Proposal for a COUNCIL DIRECTIVE on passenger car related taxes, presented by the Commission]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Commission encourages again Member States to adopt this proposal as soon as possible and to adapt their car taxation policies so as to promote the purchase of fuel efficient cars throughout the EU and help manufacturers respect the upcoming fuel efficiency framework, thus contributing their share to reducing the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of cars. Taxes differentiated over the whole range of cars on the market, so as to gradually induce a switch towards less emitting cars, would be an efficient way to reduce compliance costs for manufacturers.

'''Young Lives''' is an international research project on childhood poverty that was established in 2000 and is coordinated by a team based at the [[University of Oxford]]'s Department of International Development (Queen Elizabeth House), [[Great Britain]].

Young Lives, by its declaration, is tracing the changing lives of 12,000 children in Ethiopia, India (Andhra Pradesh), Peru and Vietnam over a 15-year period. This is the time frame set by the UN to assess progress towards the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. Through interviews, group work and case studies with the children, their parents, teachers, community representatives and others, the project is collecting information not only about their material and social circumstances, but also their perspectives on their lives and aspirations for the futures, set against the environmental and social realities of their communities.

Young Lives is following two groups of children in each country:
* 2,000 children who were born in 2001-02
* 1,000 children who were born in 1994-95.

These groups provide insights into every phase of childhood. The younger children are being tracked from infancy to their mid-teens and the older children through into adulthood, when some will become parents themselves. When this is matched with information gathered about their parents, it is possible to reveal much about the inter generational transmission of poverty, how families on the margins move in and out of poverty, and the policies that can make a real difference to their lives.

The research concentrates on 4 countries: [[Ethiopia]], [[India]] ([[Andhra Pradesh]]), [[Peru]] and [[Vietnam]], chosen because they reflect a wide range of cultural, political, geographical and social contexts. They face some of the common issues experienced by developing countries, such as high debt burden, post-conflict reconstruction and adverse environmental conditions such as drought and flood. By covering these countries, Young Lives aims to reveal patterns, commonalities and differences in four very different contexts where childhood - especially childhood poverty - is changing.

The project is core-funded by the UK [[Department for International Development]] (DFID), with sub-studies funded by [[International Development Research Center]] (IDRC) (in [[Ethiopia]]), [[UNICEF]] (in [[India]]), [[Irish Aid]] (in Vietnam) and the [[Bernard van Leer Foundation]] (in [[India]] and [[Peru]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cls.ioe.ac.uk/page.aspx?&amp;sitesectionid=904&amp;sitesectiontitle=Young+Lives Centre for Longitudinal Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Declared objectives ==
* provide good-quality information about the lives of children in different contexts;
* identify ways poverty affects children’s lives and their future prospects;
* better understand how poverty is transferred from one generation to another;
* trace linkages between key policy changes and children’s well-being;
* promote effective and sustainable poverty reduction policies;
* build capacity for and understanding of longitudinal research in the four study countries.
