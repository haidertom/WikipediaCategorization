      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10670">'''Astronomical chronology''', or '''astronomical dating''', is a technical method of dating events or artifacts that are associated with astronomical phenomena.  Written records of historical events that include descriptions of astronomical phenomena have done much to clarify the chronology of the [[Ancient Near East]]; works of art which depict the configuration of the stars and planets and buildings which are oriented to the rising and setting of celestial bodies at a particular time have all been dated through astronomical calculations.

==Dating historical events==

The use of descriptions of astronomical phenomena to date historical events began in the 16th century, a time of a renewed humanistic interest in history and of increasingly precise astronomical tables.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "Some Uses of Eclipses in Early Modern Chronology," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', 64 (2003): 213-229.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eclipse]]s in particular are relatively infrequent events and can be dated precisely.  When the circumstances are not exact and descriptions leave ambiguities, one can often use other details such as the month of the eclipse or the position of other stars and planets to identify the specific eclipse.&lt;ref&gt;[[F. R. Stephenson]] and J. M. Steele, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006JHA....37...55S "Astronomical Dating of Babylonian Texts Describing the Total Solar Eclipse of S.E. 175"], ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', 37 (2006): 55-69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronomical dating, like other forms of historical interpretation, requires care in interpreting the surviving written records.  John Steele has proposed three questions that must be asked when dating an event:  Does the record refer to an actual astronomical event, or is this merely a modern assumption?  If it does refer to an actual astronomical event, is the source reliable?  Can the record provide an unambiguous date without making unwarranted assumptions about ancient astronomical observational methods?&lt;ref&gt;John M. Steele, "The Use and Abuse of Astronomy in Establishing Ancient Chronologies," ''Physics in Canada/La Physique au Canada'', 59 (2003): 243-8, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Babylonian astronomical diaries]] provide detailed and unambiguous accounts of the positions of all the visible planets, often in relation to specific stars, that have been used to provide precise dates of events like the defeat of [[Darius III of Persia|Darius III]] by [[Alexander the Great]] at the [[Battle of Gaugamela]] on 1 October 331 BCE and of Alexander's subsequent death on 11 June 323.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jona Lendering]], [http://www.pothos.org/content/index.php?page=astronomical-diaries "Astronomical Diaries"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514150612/http://www.pothos.org/content/index.php?page=astronomical-diaries |date=2011-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the success of this method depends on the reliability of the written sources and the precision of their accounts of astronomical phenomena, attempts to date literary texts which may describe astronomical events loosely or even as metaphors have led researchers to conclusions that appear precise, but rely on invalid assumptions and are consequently less widely accepted.  Thus the attempts to date [[Vedas|Vedic texts]] describing the [[Pleiades]] as rising "due East" to about 2300 BCE, which is the time when the Pleiades rose "exactly" due East, is complicated by the fact that poetic descriptions need not be taken as reflecting precise astronomical observations, while [[Axial precession|precession]] is a very slow process which makes only small changes in the azimuth of a star rising in the East.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Witzel]], "The Pleiades and the Bears viewed from inside the Vedic texts," [http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0502/ejvs0502.txt ''Electronic Journal of Vedic Studies''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320070909/http://www.ejvs.laurasianacademy.com/ejvs0502/ejvs0502.txt |date=March 20, 2008 }}, 5 (1999), issue 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating artifacts==

[[File:Aratea 93v.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Ninth century diagram of the positions of the [[Classical planet|seven planets]] on 18 March 816.]]
Among the artifacts that can most readily be dated by astronomical techniques are depictions of the positions of the [[celestial bodies]] at a particular time.  Since the motions of the celestial bodies are all at different periods, it takes many centuries for all the planets plus the Sun and the Moon, to reach the same positions in the signs of the [[Zodiac]].  For a configuration accurate to ±15° (that is, within a single [[Zodiac#Western zodiac|sign]]) the positions of these seven bodies will only return to the same configuration once in about 3700 years.  A particular case involved a medieval [[illuminated manuscript]] which portrayed the position of these seven celestial bodies on 18 March 816; corresponding to the period when the manuscript was written. This calculation demonstrated that this illustration was not a copy of an earlier classical depiction of the position of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Mostert and Marco Mostert, "Using astronomy as an aid to dating manuscripts, The example of the [[Leiden Aratea]] planetarium", ''[[Quaerendo]]'', 20 (1999): 248-261; see esp. § 6. Reliability of the Dating Method, p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rapidly moving Moon is the most sensitive indicator for the exact time; if one can estimate the indicated position of the Moon to within a degree, the time of the diagram can be computed to within an hour.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Stahlman, "Astronomical Dating Applied to a Type of Astrological Illustration," ''Isis'', 47 (1956): 154-160, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

A striking example of this method was an astrological portrait of Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (1540–1591), which depicted the positions of the seven classical planets in the zodiac and noted the computed positions of the planets to the nearest minute of arc.  Here the largest source of error in the date was the uncertainty of 16th-century astronomical calculations.  The resulting time was about noon of 12 December 1581.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Beer, "Astronomical dating of works of art", ''Vistas in Astronomy'', 9 (1967): 177-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dating structures by their orientation==

A more controversial [[Archaeoastronomy|archaeoastronomical]] approach has been used to date structures that are believed to have been oriented on astronomical principles by measuring their orientation and computing the date in the past when a single specified celestial body, whether the Sun or a selected star, rises or sets at the measured azimuth.  The astronomer, [[Norman Lockyer]], applied this method to [[Stonehenge]]&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lockyer and  F. C. Penrose, "An Attempt to Ascertain the Date of the Original Construction of Stonehenge from Its Orientation", ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of London'', 69. (1901 - 1902): 137-147.&lt;/ref&gt; by measuring the orientation of the Stonehenge avenue and comparing it to the position of solstitial sunrise, which changes slowly due to the changing [[obliquity of the ecliptic]]. The archaeologist, F. C. Penrose, applied a similar method to ancient Greek Temples, attempting to establish their dates by relating their orientation to the appearance of stars on the horizon, the position of which changes slowly due to the [[precession of the equinoxes]].&lt;ref&gt;F. C. Penrose, "On the Results of an Examination of the Orientations of a Number of Greek Temples with a View to Connect these Angles with the Amplitudes of Certain Stars at the Time the Temples were Founded, and an Endeavour to Derive therefrom the Dates of their Foundation by Consideration of the Changes Produced upon the Right Ascension and Declination of the Stars by the Precession of the Equinoxes", ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London'', A, 184 (1893): 805-834.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wide variance of these dates from historically accepted ones led the architect and archaeologist, [[William Bell Dinsmoor]], to mistrust dates established by the slowly changing obliquity of the ecliptic or by stellar alignments, which involve an arbitrary selection of a star that rises on the proper azimuth.  Instead he proposed a method employing what was already known from historical records concerning the dates of construction of Greek temples, the festivals associated with specific temples, and the nature of the Greek [[Lunisolar calendar]].  Since the date of a festival in the Greek lunisolar calendar only recurs on the same date in the solar calendar every eight or nineteen years, Dinsmoor identified a festival connected with a specific temple and was able to determine the exact year near the historically recorded construction date when the Sun rose in alignment with the temple on the date of the festival.&lt;ref&gt;William Bell Dinsmoor, "Archæology and Astronomy", ''Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society'', 10 (1939): 95-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Recent advances in the understanding of biomolecules enabled their application to numerous fields like medicine and materials. Synthetically modified biomolecules can have diverse functionalities, such as tracking cellular events, revealing [[enzyme]] function, determining [[protein]] [[biodistribution]], [[Imaging science|imaging]] specific [[biomarkers]], and delivering [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] to targeted cells.&lt;ref name="Stephan2011"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stephanopoulos | first1 = N. | last2 = Francis | first2 = M.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bioconjugation is a crucial strategy that links these modified biomolecules with different [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]]s.

== Synthesis ==
[[Chemical synthesis|Synthesis]] of bioconjugates involves a variety of challenges, ranging from the simple and nonspecific use of a [[fluorescent dye]] marker to the complex design of [[Antibody-drug conjugate|antibody drug conjugates]].&lt;ref name="Stephan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis2010" /&gt; As a result, various bioconjugation reactions – [[chemical reactions]] connecting two biomolecules together – have been developed to chemically modify proteins. Common types of bioconjugation reactions are coupling of [[lysine]] [[amino acid residues]], coupling of [[cysteine]] residues, coupling of [[tyrosine]] residues, modification of [[tryptophan]] residues, and modification of the [[N-terminus|N-]] and [[C-terminus|C- terminus]].&lt;ref name="Stephan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalia2010" /&gt;

However, these reactions often lack [[chemoselectivity]] and efficiency, because they depend on the presence of native amino acid residues, which are usually present in large quantities that hinder selectivity. There is an increasing need for chemical strategies that can effectively attach synthetic molecules site specifically to proteins. One strategy is to first install a unique [[functional group]] onto a protein, and then a [[Bioorthogonal chemistry|bioorthogonal]] or [[Click chemistry|click type]] reaction is used to couple a biomolecule with this unique functional group.&lt;ref name="Stephan2011" /&gt; The bioorthogonal reactions targeting non-native functional groups are widely used in bioconjugation chemistry. Some important reactions are modification of [[ketone]] and [[aldehydes]], [[Staudinger ligation]] with [[azides]], copper-catalyzed [[Azide-alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition|Huisgen cycloaddition]] of azides, and strain promoted Huisgen cycloaddition of azides.&lt;ref name="Caricco2007"&gt;{{Cite journal

== Common bioconjugation reactions ==
The most common bioconjugations are coupling of a small molecule (such as [[biotin]] or a fluorescent dye) to a protein, or protein-protein conjugations, such as the coupling of an antibody to an enzyme.&lt;ref name="Koniev2015"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Chem.

&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, bioconjugation has also gained importance in [[nanotechnology]] applications such as bioconjugated [[quantum dots]].

=== Reactions of lysine residues ===
The [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic]] lysine residue is commonly targeted site in protein bioconjugation, typically through [[amine]]-reactive [[N-Hydroxysuccinimide|N-Hydroxysuccinimidyl (NHS)]] [[esters]].&lt;ref name="Francis2010" /&gt; To obtain optimal number of [[deprotonated]] lysine residues, the [[pH]] of the [[aqueous solution]] must be below the [[pKa]] of the lysine [[ammonium]] group, which is around 10.5, so the typical pH of the reaction is about 8 and 9. The common reagent for the coupling reaction is NHS-ester (shown in the first reaction below in '''Figure 1'''), which reacts with nucleophilic lysine through a lysine [[acylation]] mechanism. Other similar reagents are [[isocyanates]] and [[isothiocyanates]] that undergo a similar mechanism (shown in the second and third reactions in '''Figure 1 '''below).&lt;ref name="Stephan2011" /&gt; [[Benzoyl group|Benzoyl]] fluorides (shown in the last reaction below in '''Figure 1'''), which allows for lysine modification of proteins under mild conditions (low temperature, physiological [[pH]]), were recently proposed as an alternative to classically used lysine specific reagents.&lt;ref name="Dovgan2017"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Bioconjugate Chem. |author1=Dovgan, I. |author2=Ursuegui, S. |author3=Erb, S. |author4=Michel, C. |author5=Kolodych, S. |author6=Cianférani, S. |author7=Wagner, A. | title = Acyl Fluorides: Fast, Efficient, and Versatile Lysine-Based Protein Conjugation via Plug-and-Play Strategy | year = 2017 | doi = 10.1021/acs.bioconjchem.7b00141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bioconjugation strategies for lysine residues.tif|frameless|Figure 1. Bioconjugation strategies for lysine residues.png|409x409px]]

=== Reactions of cysteine residues ===
Because free cysteine rarely occurs on protein surface, it is an excellent choice for chemoselective modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Protein Eng. |author1=Fodje, M. N. |author2=Al-Karadaghi, S. | title = Occurrence, conformational features and amino acid propensities for the π-helix | volume = 15 | pages = 353–358 | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under basic condition, the cysteine residues will be deprotonated to generate a [[thiolate]] nucleophile, which will react with soft [[electrophiles]], such as [[maleimides]] and [[iodoacetamide]]s (shown in the first two reactions in '''Figure 2''' below). As a result, a [[carbon-sulfur bond]] is formed. Another modification of cysteine residues involves the formation of [[disulfide bond]] (shown in the third reaction in''' Figure 2'''). The [[Reduced (chemistry)|reduced]] cysteine residues react with [[exogenous]] disulfides, generating new disulfides bond on protein. An excess of disulfides is often used to drive the reaction, such as 2-thiopyridone and 3-carboxy-4-nitrothiophenol.&lt;ref name="Stephan2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis2010" /&gt; Electron-deficient [[alkynes]] were demonstrated to selectively react with cysteine residues of proteins in the presence of other nucleophilic amino acid residues. Depending on the alkyne substitution, these reactions can produce either cleavable (when alkynone derivatives are used),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Chem. Eur.

[[File:Bioconjugation strategies for cysteine residues.tif|frameless|Figure 2. Bioconjugation strategies for cysteine residues.jpg|409x409px]]

=== Reactions of tyrosine residues ===
Tyrosine residues are relatively unreactive; therefore they have not been a popular targets for bioconjugation. Recent development has shown that the tyrosine can be modified through [[electrophilic aromatic substitution]]s (EAS) reactions, and it is selective for the [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] carbon adjacent to the [[phenols|phenolic]] [[hydroxyl]] group.&lt;ref name="Stephan2011" /&gt; This becomes particularly useful in the case that cysteine residues cannot be targeted. Specifically, [[Diazonium coupling|diazonium effectively couples]] with tyrosine residues ([[diazonium salt]] shown as reagent in the first reaction in '''Figure 3 '''below), and an [[Electron-withdrawing substituent|electron withdrawing substituent]] in the 4-position of diazonium salt can effectively increase the efficiency of the reaction. Cyclic diazodicarboxyamide derivative like [[4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-dione|4-Phenyl-1,2,4-triazole-3,5-dione (PTAD)]] were reported for selective bioconjugation on tyrosine residues (the second reaction in '''Figure 3''' below).&lt;ref name="Ban2013"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = Bioconjugate Chem. |author1=Ban, H. |author2=Nagano, M. |author3=Gavrilyuk, J. |author4=Barbas, C.F. | title =Facile and Stabile Linkages through Tyrosine: Bioconjugation Strategies with the Tyrosine-Click Reaction | volume = 4 | pages = 520–532 | year = 2015 | doi = 10.1021/bc300665t | issue = 24|pmc=3658467 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-component [[Mannich reaction|Mannich-type reaction]] with [[aldehydes]] and [[aniline]]s (the last reaction in '''Figure 3''') was also described to be relatively tyrosine-selective under mild optimised reaction conditions.&lt;ref name=Joshi2004&gt;{{cite journal | journal = J.

[[File:Bioconjugation strategies for tyrosine residues.tif|frameless|Figure 3. Bioconjugation strategies for tyrosine residues|409x409px]]

=== Reactions of N- and C- termini ===
Since natural amino acid residues are usually present in large quantities, it is often difficult to modify one single site.  Strategies targeting the termini of protein have been developed, because they greatly enhanced the site selectivity of protein modification. One of the N- termini modifications involves the [[functionalization]] of the terminal amino acid. The [[Redox|oxidation]] of N-terminal [[serine]] and [[threonine]] residues are able to generate N-terminal aldehyde, which can undergo further bioorthogonal reactions (shown in the first reaction in '''Figure 4'''). Another type of modification involves the [[Condensation reaction|condensation]] of N-terminal cysteine with aldehyde, generating [[thiazolidine]] that is stable at high pH (second reaction in '''Figure 4'''). Using [[pyridoxal phosphate]] (PLP), several N-terminal amino acids can undergo [[transamination]] to yield N-terminal [[aldehyde]], such as [[glycine]] and [[aspartic acid]] (third reaction in '''Figure 4''').

[[File:Figure 4. Bioconjugation strategies for N-terminus.tif|frameless|Figure 4. Bioconjugation strategies for N-terminus.jpg|307x307px]]

An example of C-termini modification is the [[native chemical ligation]] (NCL), which is the coupling between a C-terminal [[thioester]] and a N-terminal cysteine ('''Figure 5''').

[[File:Figure 5. Bioconjugation strategies for C-terminus.tif|frameless|Figure 5. Bioconjugation strategies for C-terminus.jpg|527x527px]]

===Bioorthogonal reactions===

==== Modification of ketones and aldehydes ====
A ketone or aldehyde can be attached to a protein through the oxidation of N-terminal serine residues or transamination with PLP. Additionally, they can be introduced by incorporating [[unnatural amino acid]]s via the [[Tirrell method]] or [[Schultz method]].&lt;ref name="Caricco2007" /&gt; They will then selectively condense with an alkoxyamine and a [[hydrazine]], producing [[oxime]] and [[hydrazone]] derivatives (shown in the first and second reactions, respectively, in '''Figure 6'''). This reaction is highly chemoselective in terms of protein bioconjugation, but the [[reaction rate]] is slow. The mechanistic studies show that the [[Rate-determining step|rate determining step]] is the [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] of [[tetrahedral intermediate]], so a mild [[acidic]] solution is often employed to accelerate the dehydration step.&lt;ref name="Tilley2008" /&gt;  
 
[[File:Figure 6. Bioconjugation strategies for targeting ketones and aldehydes.jpg|frameless|Figure 6. Bioconjugation strategies for targeting ketones and aldehydes.jpg|410x410px]]

The introduction of nucleophilic catalyst can significantly enhance reaction rate (shown in '''Figure 7'''). For example, using [[aniline]] as a nucleophilic catalyst, a less populated protonated [[carbonyl]] becomes a highly populated protonated [[Schiff base]].&lt;ref name="Dirksen2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dirksen | first1 = A. | last2 = Hackeng | first2 = T.

The oxime ligation can then occur readily, and it has been reported that the rate increased up to 400 times under mild acidic condition.&lt;ref name="Dirksen2006" /&gt; The key of this catalyst is that it can generate a reactive electrophile without competing with desired product.

==== Staudinger ligation with azides ====
The [[Staudinger ligation]] of azides and [[phosphine ligand|phosphine]] has been used extensively in field of chemical biology.

[[File:Figure 8. Staudinger Ligation with Azides.jpg|frameless|Figure 8. Staudinger Ligation with Azides.jpg|500x500px]]

Contrasting with the classic Staudinger reaction, Staudinger ligation is a [[second order reaction]] in which the rate-limiting step is the formation of [[phosphazide]] (specific reaction mechanism shown in '''Figure 9'''). The [[triphenylphosphine]] first reacts with the azide to yield an azaylide through a four-membered ring [[transition state]], and then an intramolecular reaction leads to the [[iminophosphorane]] intermediate, which will then give the amide-linkage under hydrolysis.&lt;ref name="Lin2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lin | first1 = F.

==== Huisgen cyclization of azides ====

{{Main|Huisgen cycloaddition}}

===== Copper catalyzed Huisgen cyclization of azides =====
Azide has become a popular target for chemoselective protein modification, because they are small in size and has a favorable [[Thermodynamic potential|thermodynamic reaction potential]]. One such azide reactions is the [3+2] cycloaddition reaction with [[alkyne]], but the reaction requires high temperature and often gives mixtures of [[Structural isomer|regioisomers]].

An improved reaction developed by chemist [[Karl Barry Sharpless]] involves the copper (I) catalyst, which couples azide with terminal alkyne that only give 1,4 substituted 1,2,3 triazoles in high yields (shown below in '''Figure 11'''). The mechanistic study suggests a stepwise reaction.&lt;ref name="Rostov2002" /&gt; The Cu (I) first couples with [[acetylenes]], and then it reacts with azide to generate a six-membered intermediate. The process is very robust that it occurs at pH ranging from 4 to 12, and copper (II) sulfate is often used as a catalyst in the presence of a [[reducing agent]].&lt;ref name="Rostov2002" /&gt;

===== Strain promoted Huisgen cyclization of azides =====
Even though Staudinger ligation is a suitable bioconjugation in living cells without major toxicity, the phosphine’s sensitivity to air oxidation and its poor [[solubility]] in water significantly hinder its efficiency. The copper (I) catalyzed azide-alkyne coupling has reasonable reaction rate and efficiency under physiological conditions, but copper poses significant [[toxicity]] and sometimes interferes with protein functions in living cells. In 2004, chemist [[Carolyn R. Bertozzi|Carolyn R. Bertozzi’s]] lab developed a metal free [3+2] cycloaddition using strained cyclooctyne and azide. Cyclooctyne, which is the smallest stable cycloalkyne, can couple with azide through [3+2] cycloaddition, leading to two regioisomeric triazoles ('''Figure 12''').&lt;ref name="Agard2004" /&gt; The reaction occurs readily at [[room temperature]] and therefore can be used to effectively modify living cells without negative effects. It has also been reported that the installation of [[fluorine]] substituents on a cyclic alkyne can greatly accelerate the reaction rate.&lt;ref name="Tilley2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chang2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = P.

The '''Biogeography of Deep-Water Chemosynthetic Ecosystems'''  is a field project of the [[Census of Marine Life]] programme (CoML). The main aim of ChEss is to determine the [[biogeography]] of deep-water [[chemosynthetic]] [[Deep sea communities|ecosystems]] at a global scale and to understand the processes driving these ecosystems. ChEss addresses the main questions of CoML on diversity, abundance and distribution of marine species, focusing on deep-water reducing environments such as [[hydrothermal vent]]s, [[cold seep]]s, [[whale fall]]s, [[sunken wood]] and areas of low oxygen that intersect with [[continental margin]]s and [[seamount]]s.

==Background==
{{main article|deep sea|deep-sea exploration|hydrothermal vent|cold seep|whale fall}}

Deep-sea hydrothermal vents and their associated fauna were first discovered along the [[Galapagos Rift]] in the eastern Pacific in 1977. Vents are now known to occur along all active mid ocean ridges and back-arc spreading centres, from fast to ultra-slow spreading ridges. The interest in chemosynthetic environments was strengthened by the discovery of chemosynthetic-based fauna at cold seeps along the base of the [[Florida Escarpment]] in 1983. Cold seeps occur along active and passive continental margins. More recently, the study of chemosynthtetic fauna has extended to the communities that develop in other reducing habitats such as whale falls, sunken wood and areas of oxygen minima when they intersect with the margin or seamounts.
Since the first discovery of hydrothermal vents, more than 600 species have been described from vents and seeps. This is equivalent of 1 new description every 2 weeks(!). As biologists, geochemists, and physicists combine research efforts in these systems, new species will certainly be discovered. Moreover, because of the extreme conditions of the vent and seep habitat, certain species may have specific physiological adaptations with interesting results for the biochemical and medical industry.

These globally distributed, ephemeral and insular habitats that support endemic faunas offer natural laboratories for studies on dispersal, isolation and evolution. Here, hydrographic and topographic controls on biodiversity and biogeography might be much more readily resolved than in systems where climate and human activity obscure their role. In addition, hydrothermal vents have been suggested to be the habitat of the origin of life. These hypotheses are being used by ChEss researchers in collaboration with NASA to develop programmes to search for life in planets or moons of the outer space.

==Objectives of ChEss==
Only a small fraction of the global ridge system (~65000&amp;nbsp;km) and of the vast continental margin regions have been explored and their communities described. It is the aim of ChEss to improve the knowledge on the diversity, abundance and distribution of species from vents, seeps and other reducing habitats at a global scale, understanding the [[abiotic]] and [[Biotic component|biotic]] processes that shape and maintain these ecosystems and their biogeography.

'''Main ChEss Science Questions'''
* I. What are the species' relationships between different habitats: vents, seeps, whale falls, sunken wood and OMZs?
* II. What is the role of deep-water circulation and geographical barriers in gene flow and biogeography?
* III. What are the factors driving patterns of biodiversity in these habitats?

''Objective 1. To create a centralised database''

To create a centralised database, [http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/database/db_home.php ChEssBase], of deep-water vent, cold seep, whalefall and OMZ{{clarify|date=January 2011}} species. ChEssBase is a web-based database that incorporates archived and newly collected biological material. The database is geo- and bio-referenced. ChEssBase is available online and has been integrated with OBIS.

''Objective 2. To develop a long-term field programme''

To develop a long-term [http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/science/sci_field.php field programme] to locate potential vent and seep sites and continue research on whalefalls and OMZ sites. The field programme aims to explain the main gaps in our knowledge of the diversity, abundance and distribution of chemosynthetic species globally. A limited number of target areas have been selected where specific scientific questions relevant to biogeographical issues will be answered.

The target areas have been grouped into two categories. Category I, combined areas: Area A: Equatorial Atlantic Belt region; Area B: the SE Pacific region; Area C: NZ region; Area D: the Arctic and Antarctic regions, within the International Polar Year. Category II, specific areas: 1&amp;nbsp;– The ice-covered Gakkel Ridge, 2&amp;nbsp;– the (ultra)-slow ridges of the Norwegian-Greenland Sea, 3&amp;nbsp;– the northern MAR between the Iceland and Azores hot-spots; 4&amp;nbsp;– the Brazilian continental margin, 5&amp;nbsp;– the East Scotia Ridge and Bransfield Strait, 6&amp;nbsp;– the SW Indian Ridge, 7&amp;nbsp;– the Central Indian Ridge.
During the field programme, ChEss will promote the development and refinement of deep-towed, remotely operated ([[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]) and autonomous underwater (AUV) vehicle technologies to locate, map and sample new chemosynthetic systems. Using optical, chemical and acoustic techniques, ChEss researchers hope to gain a better understanding of not only biogeographical patterns, but to determine the processes driving these ecosystems.

''Objective 3: Outreach and Education''

ChEss has multi-lingual [http://www.noc.soton.ac.uk/chess/education/edu_home.php education pages] related to vents, seeps and whalefalls. There is a dedicated page for key outreach initiatives such as live cruise diaries, open days, schools activities etc.

ChEss has joined forces with the other deep-sea CoML projects and this has resulted in the creation of the DEep-Sea Education and Outreach group (DESEO) that has produced a book "Deeper than Light" published in 5 languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4136">'''Biotic Index''' (also called "Family Biotic Index") is a scale for showing the quality of an [[natural environment|environment]] by indicating the types of [[organism]]s present in it. It is often used to assess the [[water quality|quality of water]] in [[river]]s. It is measured from 1 to 10 and corresponds to the four basic water quality (Excellent, Good, Fair or Poor). The concept of the Biotic Index was developed by [[Cherie Stephens]] in an effort to provide a simple measurement of stream [[water pollution|pollution]] and its effects on the biology of the stream.

==Technique==
To assign a biotic index value to a specific water site, the tester first collects macro invertebrates from portions of the sample area of the stream, river or lake and separate them into groups of similar-looking organisms. More extensive testing can be done by looking for certain microscopic organisms.

Then an identification key is used to help determine which category or group the organism belongs in and allows a numerical value be assigned to that organism. A worksheet is then used to calculate the final value or score of all the organisms found. Depending upon the worksheet's equations, the score determines the condition of the water quality. 

==Usefulness of macro invertebrates==
Aquatic macro invertebrates have some general characteristics that make them very useful to assess stream health:
# They are abundant and found in water bodies throughout the world
# They are not extremely mobile  
# They carry out part or all of their life cycle within the stream or river.

Macro invertebrates limited mobility and extended presence in the water means that they are exposed on a continuous basis to water quality in that stream or river.  In particular, many of these organisms breath dissolved oxygen that is in the water. They are also easier to see at the time of sampling.

Not all the macro invertebrates found in samples are listed on the biotic index scoring sheets. This is because some do not rely on oxygen within the water for survival. Many are able to collect air from the atmosphere and hold a bubble alongside their body to use like a scuba diver uses a tank of oxygen. 

For those macro invertebrates that do rely on dissolved oxygen, some can only live in water that has a lot of oxygen.  Others can live in water that doesn't have much oxygen dissolved in it at all.  Generally, it is assumed that the more pollution there is in the water, the less oxygen.

==Classification==
The biotic index works by assigning different levels of tolerance to pollution to the different types of organisms. 
The types of macro invertebrates and other organisms found during sampling are broken into 4 groups:
# Pollution intolerant: These organisms are highly sensitive to pollution (Stonefly or Alderfly Larva)
# Semi-Pollution intolerant: These organisms are sensitive to pollution (Dragonfly Larva or Craw fish)
# Semi-Pollution tolerant: These organisms will be found in clean and slightly polluted waterways (Snails or Black Fly Larva)
# Pollution tolerant: These organisms will be found in polluted, as well as clean aquatic ecosystems (Leeches, Blood worms)

Some index worksheets combine groups 2 and 3 together, giving only 3 groups. Each group has a number assigned to it and is multiplied by the number of organisms found in that group. This is why identifying the type of organism is important.

[[Image:201 Elements of the Human Body-01.jpg|thumb|right|500px|The main elements that compose the human body are shown from most abundant (by mass, not by fraction of atoms) to least abundant.]]

Body composition may be analyzed in terms of molecular type e.g., [[water]], [[protein]], [[connective tissue]], [[fat]]s (or [[lipid]]s), [[hydroxylapatite]] (in bones), [[carbohydrates]] (such as [[glycogen]] and [[glucose]]) and [[DNA]]. In terms of tissue type, the body may be analyzed into water, fat, muscle, bone, etc. In terms of cell type, the body contains hundreds of different types of cells, but notably, the largest ''number'' of cells contained in a human body (though not the largest mass of cells) are not human cells, but bacteria residing in the normal human gastrointestinal tract.

==Elements==
[[File:Two pie graphs about the composition of the human body.png|thumb|300px|Pie charts of typical human body composition by percent of mass, and by percent of atomic composition (atomic percent).]]
Almost 99% of the mass of the human body is made up of six elements: [[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], [[nitrogen]], [[calcium]], and [[phosphorus]]. Only about 0.85% is composed of another five elements: [[potassium]], [[sulfur]], [[sodium]], [[chlorine]], and [[magnesium]]. All 11 are necessary for life. The remaining elements are [[trace element]]s, of which more than a dozen are thought on the basis of good evidence to be necessary for life. All of the mass of the trace elements put together (less than 10 grams for a human body) do not add up to the body mass of magnesium, the least common of the 11 non-trace elements.

===Other elements===
Not all elements which are found in the human body in trace quantities play a role in life. Some of these elements are thought to be simple bystander contaminants without function (examples: caesium, titanium), while many others are thought to be active toxics, depending on amount (cadmium, mercury, radioactives). The possible utility and toxicity of a few elements at levels normally found in the body (aluminium) is debated. Functions have been proposed for trace amounts of cadmium and lead, although these are almost certainly toxic in amounts very much larger than normally found in the body. There is evidence that arsenic, an element normally considered a toxin in higher amounts, is essential in ultratrace quantities, in mammals such as rats, hamsters, and goats.&lt;ref name="Anke M. Arsenic 1986"&gt;Anke M. "Arsenic". In: Mertz W. ed., ''Trace elements in human and Animal Nutrition'', 5th ed. Orlando, FL: Academic Press, 1986, 347-372; Uthus E. O., "Evidency for arsenical essentiality", ''Environmental Geochemistry and Health'', 1992, 14:54-56; Uthus E.O., Arsenic essentiality and factors affecting its importance. In: Chappell W. R., Abernathy C. O., Cothern C. R. eds., ''Arsenic Exposure and Health''. Northwood, UK: Science and Technology Letters, 1994, 199-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements  (silicon, boron, nickel, vanadium) are probably needed by mammals also, but in far smaller doses. Bromine is used abundantly by some (though not all) lower organisms, and opportunistically in [[eosinophil]]s in humans. One study has found bromine to be necessary to collagen IV synthesis in humans.&lt;ref name="pmid24906154"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=McCall AS, Cummings CF, Bhave G, Vanacore R, Page-McCaw A, Hudson BG |title = Bromine Is an Essential Trace Element for Assembly of Collagen IV Scaffolds in Tissue Development and Architecture|journal = Cell|volume = 157|issue = 6|pages = 1380–92|year = 2014|pmid = 24906154|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.009|pmc=4144415}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fluorine]] is used by a number of plants to manufacture toxins (see that element) but in humans only functions as a local (topical) hardening agent in tooth enamel, and not in an essential biological role.&lt;ref name="Lehninger"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nelson, Lehninger, Cox |title=Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry |date=2008 |publisher=Macmillan |edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elemental composition list===
{{main article|Dietary element}}
The average {{convert|70|kg|abbr=on|adj=on}} [[Human body|adult human body]] contains approximately {{val|7|e=27}} [[atom]]s and contains at least detectable traces of 60 [[chemical element]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://education.jlab.org/qa/mathatom_04.html How many atoms are in the human body?]&lt;/ref&gt; About 29 of these elements are thought to play an active positive role in life and health in humans.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;"Ultratrace minerals". Authors: Nielsen, Forrest H. USDA, ARS Source: ''Modern nutrition in health and disease'' / editors, Maurice E. Shils ... et al.. Baltimore : Williams &amp; Wilkins, c. 1999, p. 283-303. Issue Date: 1999 URI: [http://hdl.handle.net/10113/46493]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative amounts of each element vary by individual, mainly due to differences in the proportion of fat, muscle and bone in their body. Persons with more fat will have a higher proportion of carbon and a lower proportion of most other elements (the proportion of hydrogen will be about the same).
The numbers in the table are averages of different numbers reported by different references.

The adult human body averages ~53% water.{{fv|date=July 2018|reason=Not in the source cited. And if this was obtained by averaging the male and female averages, then it's a terrible math and incorrect}} This varies substantially by age, sex, and adiposity. In a large sample of adults of all ages and both sexes, the figure for water fraction by weight was found to be 48 ±6% for females and 58 ±8% water for males.&lt;ref name="here"&gt;See table 1. [http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/33/1/27.full.pdf here]&lt;/ref&gt; Water is ~11% hydrogen by [[mass]] but ~67% hydrogen by [[atomic percent]], and these numbers along with the complementary % numbers for oxygen in water, are the largest contributors to overall mass and atomic composition figures. Because of water content, the human body contains more oxygen by mass than any other element, but more hydrogen by atom-fraction than any element.

The elements listed below as "Essential in humans" are those listed by the (US) [[Food and Drug Administration]] as essential nutrients,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm064928.htm "Guidance for Industry: A Food Labeling Guide 14. Appendix F"]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as six additional elements: oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen (the fundamental building blocks of life on Earth), sulfur (essential to all cells) and cobalt (a necessary component of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;). Elements listed as "Possibly" or "Probably" essential are those cited by the [[National Research Council (United States)]] as beneficial to human health and possibly or probably essential.&lt;ref name="Medicine2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Institute of Medicine|title=Dietary Reference Intakes: The Essential Guide to Nutrient Requirements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dYZZTgjDeccC&amp;pg=PA415|accessdate=21 June 2016|date=29 September 2006|publisher=National Academies Press|isbn=978-0-309-15742-1|pages=313–19, 415–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the 94 naturally occurring chemical elements, 60 are listed in the table above. Of the remaining 34, it is not known how many occur in the human body.

Most of the elements needed for life are relatively [[abundance of the chemical elements|common in the Earth's crust]]. [[Aluminium]], the third most common element in the [[Earth's crust]] (after [[oxygen]] and [[silicon]]), serves no function in living cells, but is harmful in large amounts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.nyu.edu/content?ChunkIID=164929 Aluminum Toxicity]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transferrin]]s can bind aluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mizutani | first1 = K. | last2 = Mikami | first2 = B. | last3 = Aibara | first3 = S. | last4 = Hirose | first4 = M. | title = Structure of aluminium-bound ovotransferrin at 2.15 Å resolution | doi = 10.1107/S090744490503266X | journal = Acta Crystallographica Section D | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 1636 | year = 2005 | pmid = | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Molecules==
The composition of the human body is expressed in terms of chemicals:
*[[Water]]
*[[Protein]]s – including those of [[hair]], [[connective tissue]], etc.
*[[Fat]]s (or [[lipid]]s)
*[[Hydroxylapatite]] in bones
*[[Carbohydrates]] such as [[glycogen]] and [[glucose]]
*[[DNA]]
*Dissolved inorganic [[ion]]s such as [[sodium]], [[potassium]], [[chloride]], [[bicarbonate]], [[phosphate]]
*[[Gas]]es such as [[oxygen]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrogen oxide]], [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[acetaldehyde]], [[formaldehyde]], [[methanethiol]]. These may be dissolved or present in the gases in the [[lung]]s or [[intestine]]s. [[Ethane]] and [[pentane]] are produced by oxygen free radicals.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Fox, [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18024195.500-the-speed-of-life.html "The speed of life"], ''New Scientist'', No 2419, 1 November 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Many other small molecules, such as [[amino acid]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, [[nucleobase]]s, [[nucleoside]]s, [[nucleotide]]s, [[vitamin]]s, [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]s.
*[[Free radical]]s such as [[superoxide]], [[hydroxyl]], and [[hydroperoxyl]].
The '''composition of the human body''' can be viewed on an [[atom]]ic and [[Molecule|molecular]] scale as shown in this article.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8816">'''Computational criminology''' is an interdisciplinary field which uses computing science methods to formally define criminology concepts, improve our understanding of complex phenomena, and generate solutions for related problems.

==Methods==
Computing science methods being used include:
* [[Algorithms]]
* [[Data Mining]]
* [[Data Structures]]
* [[Formal Methods]]
* [[Software Development Process]]

==Areas of usage==

Computational criminology is interdisciplinary in the sense that both criminologists and computing scientists work together to ensure that computational models properly match their theoretical and real-world counterparts. Areas of criminology for which computational approaches are being used include:
* [[Environmental Criminology]]
* [[Identity Theft]]
* [[Justice]]

===Forensics===

Computational forensics (CF) is a [[quantitative research|quantitative approach]] to the methodology of the [[forensics|forensic sciences]]. It involves computer-based [[Scientific modeling|modeling]], [[computer simulation]], [[analysis]], and [[Pattern recognition|recognition]] in studying and solving problems posed in various forensic disciplines. '''CF''' integrates expertise from [[computational science]] and [[forensics|forensic sciences]].

A broad range of objects, substances and processes are investigated, which are mainly based on pattern evidence, such as toolmarks, fingerprints, shoeprints, documents etc.,&lt;ref&gt;S. N. Srihari, "Beyond CSI: The Rise of Computational Forensics", [http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/beyond-csi-the-rise-of-computational-forensics/0 IEEE Spectrum], pp. 38-43, December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but also [[Physiology|physiological]] and [[behavioral pattern]]s, [[DNA]], [[digital evidence]] and [[crime scene]]s.

Computational methods find a place in the forensic sciences in several ways,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csm.ornl.gov/viz/apps/comp-foren.html Computational Forensics Project - Automated Reconstruction of Human Faces (Archival page 6/2002 )]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wong | first = J.L. |author2=Kirovski, D. |author3=Potkonjak, M. | title = Computational forensic techniques for intellectual property protection | journal =  [[IEEE]] Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems | issue = 6 | volume = 23| pages = 987–994 | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1109/TCAD.2004.828122 }} DIO 10.1109/TCAD.2004.828122&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.genomeweb.com/informatics/propelled-computational-forensics-911-ncbi-preps-qa-software-id-katrina-victims Propelled Into Computational Forensics by 9/11, NCBI Preps QA Software to ID Katrina Victims (November 28, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Franke | first = Katrin |author2=Srihari, Sargur | title = Computational Forensics: Towards Hybrid-Intelligent Crime Investigation | journal = Third International Symposium on Information Assurance and Security, 2007.

[[Computer forensics]] (also referred to as "[[digital forensics]]" or "forensic information technology") is one specific discipline that could use [[computational science]] to study [[digital evidence]]. '''Computational Forensics''' examines diverse types of [[evidence]].

====Forensic animation====

Forensic animation is a branch of [[forensic science]] in which [[audio-visual]] reconstructions of incidents or accidents are created to aid investigators.  Examples include the use of [[computer animation]], stills, and other audio visual aids.  Application of [[computer animation]] in courtrooms today is becoming more popular.

The first use of forensic animation was in ''Connors v. United States'', both sides used computer re-creations and animations in a case surrounding the crash of Delta Flight 191 on August 2, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hofer|first1=Inga|title=The Rise of Courtroom Technology and its Effect on the Federal Rules of E vidence and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure|url=https://digitalcommons.law.msu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1102&amp;context=king|website=Michigan State University College of Law|accessdate=7 January 2018|date=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crash resulted in the deaths of 137 people and extensive property damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gold|first1=Stuart|title=Future Forensic Animation - Its Origins, Creation, Limitations and Future|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/animation/forensic_animation.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the resulting lawsuit a method was required to explain complicated information and situations to the jury. As part of the plaintiff presentation, a 45-minute computer generated presentation was created to explain the intricacies of the evidence and thus began forensic animation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marcotte|first1=Paul|title=Animated Evidence - Delta 191 Crash Re-Created through Computer Simulations at Trial|journal=ABA Journal|date=1989|volume=75|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/abaj75&amp;div=261&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reported use of computer animation in a U.S. criminal trial was in the 1991 Marin County, CA homicide trial of James Mitchell (of the porno-businessman Mitchell Brothers)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pinsky|first1=Mark I.|title=Jury Out on High-Tech Courtroom : Computer animation, televised testimony and other innovations could streamline the justice system.

Times|date=17 December 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution used the animation to explain the complex details of the shooting incident to the jury. It showed the positions of James Mitchell, Artie Mitchell (the victim), the bullet impact points, and the path taken by bullets as they entered Artie's body. The animation was admitted, over objection by the defense, and the case resulted in a conviction. The use of the animation was upheld on appeal and the success of the forensic animation led to its use in many other trials. In India Prof. [[T.D Dogra|T D Dogra]] at AIIMS New Delhi in 2008 used animation to explain the court of law and investigating agencies first time in two important cases of firearm injuries,case of Murder and Terrorist encounter killings([[Batla House encounter case|Batla house encounter case]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medind.nic.in/jal/t14/i1/jalt14i1p104.pdf|title=Reconstruction of Scene by Forensic Animation Two Case Reports|publisher=J Indian Acad Forensic Med.Vol. 36, No. 1|date=January 2014|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by California's [[California Legislative Analyst's Office|Legislative Analyst's Office]] that manages the state budget in a strictly nonpartisan fashion, the CBO was created as a nonpartisan agency by the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]]. It has earned the reputation of a trusted, in-house quasi-[[think tank]] for the Congress. 

There is a consensus among economists that "the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==History==
The Congressional Budget Office was created by Title II of the [[Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974]] (Pub. L. 93-344), which was signed into law by President [[Richard Nixon]] on July 12, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Adam Kelsey|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/spicers-rebuke-puts-spotlight-congressional-budget-office-amid/story?id=46017070|title=What the CBO does and how it gets its numbers|date=March 13, 2017|publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official operations began on February 24, 1975, with [[Alice Rivlin]] as director.&lt;ref name="Joyce"&gt;Philip Joyce, [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/PJ_WorkingPaper9_Feb11_Final.pdf The Congressional Budget Office at Middle Age], Working Paper #9, Hutchins Center on Fiscal &amp; Monetary Policy, [[Brookings Institution]] (February 17, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

The CBO's creation stems from a fight between President Richard Nixon and a Democratic-controlled Congress. Congress wanted to protect its [[power of the purse]] from the executive.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|author=Sarah Binder|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/03/15/this-is-why-the-congressional-budget-office-will-likely-survive-republican-attacks/|title=This is why the Congressional Budget Office will likely survive Republican attacks|website=Washington Post|date=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/3/13/14860856/congressional-budget-office-cbo-explained|title=The Congressional Budget Office, explained|work=Vox|access-date=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBO was created "within the legislative branch to bolster Congress’s budgetary understanding and ability to act. Lawmakers' aim was both technical and political: Generate a source of budgetary expertise to aid in writing annual budgets and lessen the legislature’s reliance on the president's [[Office of Management and Budget]]."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since its creation, the CBO has since supplanted the OMB "as the authoritative source of information on the economy and the budget in the eyes of Congress, the press, and the public."&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt;

==Mission==
The Congressional Budget Office is [[Nonpartisanism|nonpartisan]], and produces "independent analyses of budgetary and economic issues to support the Congressional budget process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/2016-IntroToCBO.pdf|title=Introduction to CBO|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=March 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, the agency releases reports and cost estimates for proposed legislation, without issuing any policy recommendations.

With respect to estimating spending for Congress, the Congressional Budget Office serves a purpose parallel to that of the [[U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation|Joint Committee on Taxation]] for estimating revenue for Congress, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]] for estimating revenues for the [[Executive (government)|Executive branch]]. This includes projections on the effect on [[national debt]] and cost estimates for legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/about/overview|title=Introduction to CBO|date=21 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operations==
Section 202(e) of the Budget Act requires the CBO to submit periodic reports about fiscal policy to the [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Budget|Senate]] budget committees to provide baseline projections of the federal budget. This is currently done by preparation of an annual ''Economic and Budget Outlook'' plus a mid-year update. The agency also each year issues ''An Analysis of the President's Budgetary Proposals'' for the upcoming fiscal year per a standing request of the [[Senate Committee on Appropriations]]. These three series are designated essential titles distributed to [[Federal depository library|Federal Depository Libraries]] and are available for purchase from the [[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Publishing Office]]. The CBO often provides testimony in response to requests from various Congressional committees and issues letters responding to queries made by members of Congress.

==Divisions==
The Congressional Budget Office is divided into eight divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staffing and Organization|url=http://www.cbo.gov/about/our-organization-and-people/|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House of Representatives]] and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]] jointly appoint the CBO Director after considering recommendations from the two budget committees. The term of office is four years, with no limit on the number of terms a director may serve. Either house of Congress, however, may remove the director by resolution. At the expiration of a term of office, the person serving as Director may continue in the position until his or her successor is appointed.

== Reception ==
Whereas politicians on both sides of the aisle have criticized the CBO when its estimates have been politically inconvenient,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-na-pol-cbo-report-qa-20170314-story.html|title=What is the CBO, and can you trust its numbers on the Republican healthcare plan?|last=Lee|first=Don|date=2017-03-14|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-03-23|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; economists and other academics overwhelmingly reject that the CBO is partisan or that it fails to produce credible forecasts.

A March 2017 survey of leading economists shows a consensus behind the notion that "adjusting for legal restrictions on what the CBO can assume about future legislation and events, the CBO has historically issued credible forecasts of the effects of both Democratic and Republican legislative proposals."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/the-cbo|title=The CBO|publisher=[[Initiative on Global Markets]] (IGM), [[University of Chicago]] [[Booth School of Business]]|language=en-US|date=March 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to MIT economist [[David Autor]], the "CBO has a good track record with a very difficult assignment. It errs, but not systematically or with partisan intent."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; According to Yale economist [[Christopher Udry]], "There is no credible evidence of partisan bias."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Economist [[Walter E. Williams]] wrote in 1998 that the CBO was well-regarded for its "honest numbers" on fiscal and economic matters.&lt;ref name="Joyce" /&gt; According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', "the CBO’s analyses and forecasting are regarded as good or better than others doing similar work... economists say that the CBO’s economic projections generally compare favorably against other outfits, and its long-term budget estimates have been fairly accurate."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to George Washington University political scientist Sarah Binder, the CBO "has emerged over its history as a neutral analyst of congressional budgets and cost estimates for proposed legislation."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The agency has "a nonpartisan staff culture".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Historically, the [[House Budget Committee]] and [[Senate Budget Committee]] have insulated the CBO from external pressures and attempts to politicize or weaken the office.&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt; Professor Philip Joyce of the [[University of Maryland School of Public Policy]] writes:

{{quote|This is quite surprising, in a sense, given the partisan nature of the Congress. It is not necessarily that these partisans have embraced nonpartisanship as a positive end in itself, however. Rather, the Budget Committees (and especially their leadership and staff) have recognized that a weak CBO (one that does not have a reputation for objective analysis, and whose conclusions are viewed as partisan) is not in their interest. A weak CBO weakens the Budget Committees, and indeed weakens Congress as a whole in its inevitable battles with the executive over budget and economic policy.&lt;ref name="Joyce"/&gt;}}

'''Continuous monitoring and adaptive control''' (CMAC) is a category of [[stormwater]] [[Best management practice for water pollution|best management practice]] that allows for a wider range of operation of [[detention pond|detention]] and [[retention pond|retention]] ponds. CMAC systems typically consist of a [[piezometer|water level sensor]], an [[butterfly valve|actuated valve]], and an internet connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Jamie Lefkowitz, Alexa Sarmanian, and Marcus Quigley |title=Continuous monitoring and adaptive control—the internet of things transforms stormwater management |url=http://www.newea.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NEWEA-Journal_Spr16.pdf#page=25 |work=Journal of the New England Water Environment Association |issn=1077-3002 |volume=50 |issue=1 |pages=44–51 |date=Spring 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific applications of CMAC include flood protection, water quality treatment, water reuse, and channel protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advancements in Monitoring and RealTime Control Technology Result in Improved Stormwater Management |url=http://www.ohstormwaterconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2016-presentations/F2A-2Monitoring&amp;ControlTechLefkowitzTootLevy.pdf |work=Ohio Stormwater Conference |accessdate=2 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11007">{{short description|A global agenda for action in marine conservation}}
'''''Defying Ocean's End''''' (DOE) is a global agenda for action in [[marine conservation]] compiled in a 2004 [[Island Press]] book.  It is also the title of a 2003 [[Los Cabos]] ([[Mexico]]) conference, where the agenda was formulated.

The ''DOE'' website describes itself as "a practical agenda of action to safeguard the ocean for future generations to come.  This dynamic strategy-including costs and recommendations-is a collective voice for those seeking to reverse the disturbing trends we are witnessing in the ocean today.  As never again, we have an opportunity now to respond to this crisis, by moving beyond localized and ''ad hoc'' initiatives - however good they might be - to coordinated global action."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org ''Defying Ocean's End'' website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The website also lists a "DOE Office" charged with distributing the agenda.  The office is composed of Dr. [[Sylvia Earle]], [[Arlo Hemphill]], Tim Noviello and Linda K. Glover:.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/doe_office.asp ''Defying Ocean's End'' Office Biographies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201090309/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/doe_office.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Defying Ocean's End'' book==
Published in 2004 by Island Press, ''Defying Ocean's End'' is now used{{By whom|date=August 2016}} as a university textbook for marine conservation. The book is a collaboration of over 70 authors and was edited by Linda K. Glover and Dr. [[Sylvia Earle]], along with assistant editor [[Arlo Hemphill]] and maps created by Debra Fischman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandpress.org/ip/books/book/islandpress/D/bo3559385.html ''Defying Ocean's End'' book]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book also includes a [[foreword]] by [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]] founding director Graeme Kelleher.

==Los Cabos conference==
''Defying Ocean's End'' was launched at a conference held in Los Cabos, Mexico on May 29 to June 3, 2003.  The conference was organized by [[Conservation International]]; convened by American [[oceanographer]], Dr. Sylvia Earle, and [[Intel Corporation]] co-founder, [[Gordon Moore]]; and chaired by Graeme Kelleher. It included the participation of nearly 150 experts from more than 20 countries, representing the fields of [[ocean science]], finance, and conservation.  A select group of senior representatives from world governments, corporations and the media were also in attendance.  In addition to Conservation International, a number of large, international conservation organizations collaborated on the conference.  These included [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[The Ocean Conservancy]], [[Wildlife Conservation Society]], the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] and the [[World Wildlife Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/partners.asp ''DOE'' Partners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201095229/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/partners.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Conference was sponsored by the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], [[BP]], [[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]], [[Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines]] and the Alexander Henry Foundation.

The conference was structured into 5 regional case studies, 7 thematic working groups, and a business team focused on developing Action Plans which addressed specific issues and outcomes - with priorities, and costs identified—for 1-year, 3-year, and 10-year timeframes. Five case studies were presented to all Conference participants, which addressed lessons learned and recommendations in very different regions: The [[Caribbean]], [[Seamounts]], [[Southern Ocean|Antarctic Waters]], The [[Coral Triangle]] and the [[Gulf of California]].

Break-out discussions were divided into seven Thematic Working Groups on widely ranging science, conservation, social, economic and legal topics:

*Ocean-Use Planning and [[Marine protected area|Marine Protected Areas]]
*Economic Incentives and Disincentives
*Land-Ocean Interface
*Maintaining/Restoring Functional [[Marine Ecosystems]]
*Communication
*Ocean Governance
*The Unknown Ocean

A Business Team led by Larry Linden of [[Goldman Sachs]] worked with all groups to identify key cost drivers and estimate reasonable total solution costs.

===Results===
The DOE website lists the following "high level" results:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defyingoceansend.org/about.asp About DOE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201084945/http://www.defyingoceansend.org/about.asp |date=2008-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Global Governance: Treat the 60% of the world ocean outside of national Exclusive Economic Zones as a World Ocean Public Trust. Establish legal and implementation approaches concerning ocean uses in the high seas - including fisheries - under coordinated, international multi-use zoning regimes.
* Fisheries Reform: Use market-based mechanisms and changes to subsidies to reform fisheries through development of [[sustainable fishing]] projects, and the establishment of a global fund to provide incentives for the adoption of sustainable practices.
* Communications: Implement global and regional communications plans; focus on educating the general public worldwide to ocean problems. Initiate global all-media campaigns on major issues. In developing nations, tailor the message to local cultural concerns, understanding and information networks (e.g., tribal elders), and build local capacity for disseminating the message.
* Marine Protected Areas/Large Marine Ecosystems: Create, consolidate, and strengthen marine protected areas (MPAs) into a globally representative network. Develop/implement coordinated, global large marine ecosystem (LME) programs in identified priority regions. Provide more robust multi-use zoning and enforcement mechanisms to protect these LMEs. Establish LME/MPA protections over 5% of the world ocean within the next 10 years (0.7% currently).
* Global Science: Develop an expanded applied research program focused on top priority marine environments high in endemism and biodiversity - seamounts, shallow- and deep-water reefs, continental slopes, caves and blue holes.

In chemical [[separation processes]], an '''Energy separating agent''' ('''ESA''') is the heat or shaft work added to facilitate the separation of two chemical species. It is contrasted with a [[mass separating agent]], which is any chemical species added to the reaction that facilitates the reaction. ESAs are used in many common separation procedures.

Some important examples of procedures utilizing ESAs vaporization (heat added), distillation (heat added), crystallization (heat evolved), and stripping (heat added).

'''Environment Agency Wales''', (''Asiantaeth yr Amgylchedd Cymru'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]) was, until 31 March 2013, a [[Welsh Government sponsored bodies|Welsh Government Sponsored Body]], while also being part of the [[Environment Agency]] for England and Wales. Its principal aims were to protect and improve the environment in [[Wales]] and to promote [[sustainable development]].

It had an operational area defined along its Eastern boundary by the catchments of the [[River Dee (Wales)|River Dee]] and the [[River Wye]]. Those parts of the [[River Severn]] in Wales were managed by the Environment Agency whilst those parts of the River Dee and River Wye catchments that are in England were nevertheless managed by Environment Agency Wales. The Agency also had a public facing boundary which corresponded to the political boundary of Wales. 

On 1 April 2013 the organisation was merged with the [[Countryside Council for Wales]] and [[Forestry Commission|Forestry Commission Wales]] into a single environmental body, [[Natural Resources Wales]].

== Role and responsibilities ==

Environment Agency Wales' role included: reducing industry’s impacts on the environment, enforcing pollution legislation and reducing the harm caused by flooding and pollution incidents. It also oversaw the management of waste, water resources and freshwater fisheries; cleaning up rivers, coastal waters and contaminated land and improving wildlife habitats.

By influencing others to change attitudes and behaviour, it aimed to make the environment cleaner and healthier for people and wildlife.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency websit - About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment Agency website - About Us|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/aboutus/default.aspx|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Priorities ==

=== Act to reduce climate change and its consequences ===
Environment Agency Wales managed the risk of [[flooding]] from rivers and the sea in Wales. To do this, Environment Agency Wales built, maintained and operated flood defences to protect people and property. It also issued [http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/homeandleisure/floods/31618.aspx flood warnings] and works with communities at risk of flooding to help them find appropriate solutions to flood risk through its [https://web.archive.org/web/20120930040854/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/113810.aspx Flood Awareness Wales] programme. When a flood happened, Environment Agency Wales worked with the emergency services and local authorities to minimise the harm to people and damage to property.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Corporate Plan 2010 - 15"&gt;{{cite web|last=Environment Agency Wales|title=Corporate Plan 2010 - 15|url=http://abetterenvironmentforwales.co.uk/6004_EA_Eng%20index%20page_2.swf|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protect and improve water, land and air ===
Environment Agency Wales was responsible for ensuring that environmental legislation was implemented properly on behalf of the Welsh and UK governments.  This included regulating businesses such as power stations, chemical factories, metal processors, waste management sites, construction industry, food and drink manufacturers, farms and the water industry – to make sure that their work did not damage the environment.  Where people and businesses needed to take water for drinking, industry and irrigation, Environment Agency Wales ensured that they did so without damaging the environment. To do this, Environment Agency Wales gave advice and issued permits, authorisations and consents to businesses that complied with legislative requirements.  When pollution occurred, Environment Agency Wales worked to minimise any environmental damage, identify the source and stop any further pollution. If businesses failed to comply with their permits, and pollution occurred, Environment Agency Wales took enforcement action against them, including prosecution on occasion. Environment Agency Wales also led on dealing with serious waste crime which is often organised, large-scale and profitable. Priority waste crime types include large-scale illegal dumping, illegal waste sites and illegal exports of waste. It also dealt with high risk activities such as illegal disposal of wastes, where there was an actual or imminent threat of significant flooding or pollution.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Corporate Plan 2010 - 15"/&gt;

=== Work with people and communities to create better places ===
Environment Agency Wales created and improved habitats for fish and other water-based wildlife such as salmon and helped species that were at risk, such as the [[freshwater pearl mussel]]. It also managed licences for fishing and navigation, so that people in Wales – and people visiting Wales – could enjoy the water environment.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Corporate Plan 2010 - 15"/&gt;

=== Work with businesses and other organisations to use resources wisely ===
Environment Agency Wales licensed water abstractions from groundwater, rivers and lakes to ensure that the needs of people and business were met whilst protecting the environment and wildlife. It also regulated waste management facilities, such as [[Landfill|landfill sites]] or large [[In-vessel composting|composting]] facilities,  to ensure that they did not cause environmental damage and monitored the [[Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme|Landfill Allowances Scheme]] to track how waste is managed in Wales.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Corporate Plan 2010 - 15"/&gt;

== Accreditation ==

*  For the fourth year running, [[Stonewall (charity)|Stonewall Cymru]], named Environment Agency Wales as the best place to work in Wales for lesbian, gay and bisexual people in 2012.&lt;ref name="Stonewall Top 100 Employers 2012"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stonewall Top 100 Employers 2012|url=http://www.stonewallcymru.org.uk/cymru/english/at_work/stonewalls_top_100_employers/default.asp|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Environment Agency Wales was accredited to both the [[ISO 14001]] and [[Eco-Management and Audit Scheme|EMAS]] environmental management standard.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Awards and Accreditations"&gt;{{cite web|last=Environment Agency|title=Awards and Accreditations|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/aboutus/123002.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a [[Welsh Government Public body]], Environment Agency Wales had to provide its services within the Welsh political boundary (its public facing boundary) in Welsh as well as in English in accordance with the [[Welsh Language Act 1993]].

== Structure ==

Environment Agency Wales had three operational areas, South East Wales, South West Wales and North Wales. Its other departments were Flood and Coastal Risk Management, Corporate Services, Human Resources, Finance and the policy department known as Strategic Unit Wales. All departments reported to the Director of Environment Agency Wales, [[Viscount Mills|Chris Mills]].

=== Senior Management structure ===
Prior to its merger in early 2013:
* [[Vicount Mills|Chris Mills]] - Director, Environment Agency Wales
* Steve Brown - Area Manager, South West Wales
* Ceri Davies - Strategic Unit Manager
* David Edwell - Area Manager, North Wales
* Gareth O’Shea - Area Manager, South East Wales
* Andrew Jervis - Finance Manager (Acting)
* Helen Davies - Human Resources Manager (Acting)
* Graham Hillier - Flood &amp; Coastal Risk Management Manager

Environment Agency Wales had three statutory committees, each with their own responsibility and each contributing towards making Wales a better place for people and wildlife.&lt;ref name="Environment Agency Wales Committees"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment Agency Wales Committees|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/aboutus/organisation/35613.aspx|accessdate=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The committees were set up by Parliament under the [[Environment Act 1995]]. The committees were made up of external members who were elected to stand on the committee because they had the relevant expertise.

=== Environment Protection Advisory Committee Wales (EPAC) ===

EPAC advised Environment Agency Wales on issues of environmental protection, pollution control, water resources, air quality and waste regulation.

'''Chairman:''' Prof Tom Pritchard

=== Flood Risk Management Wales Committee (FRMW) ===

'''Chairman''': Deep Sagar

=== Fisheries, Ecology and Recreation Advisory Committee (FERAC) ===

FERAC advised Environment Agency Wales on maintaining, improving and developing fisheries as well as recreation, navigation and conservations issues.

'''Chairman:''' Dr Graeme Harris

== Natural Resources Wales ==
On 1 April 2013, Environment Agency Wales, [[Countryside Council for Wales]] and [[Forestry Commission|Forestry Commission Wales]] were merged into [[Natural Resources Wales]], a single body delivering the [[Welsh Government]]'s environmental priorities for Wales.&lt;ref name="A living Wales – a new framework for our environment, our countryside and our seas"&gt;{{cite web|title=A living Wales – a new framework for our environment, our countryside and our seas|url=http://wales.gov.uk/consultations/environmentandcountryside/eshlivingwalescons/?lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WG-SingleBody&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://wales.gov.uk/topics/environmentcountryside/consmanagement/seb/?lang=en  |title=Single Body  |publisher=Welsh Government  |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Carl F. Eyring Science Center''' (ESC) is one of the science buildings on the [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU) campus in [[Provo, Utah]].  It was built in 1950 and named after [[Carl F. Eyring]] in 1954.

The ESC houses the departments of Physics and Astronomy, Geology, and Food Science and Nutrition.  The Department of Chemistry has in the past been located at the ESC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=51304 | year=1991 | author1=Xie | first1=W.

In 1968 an underground physics research lab was added to the north end of the building.  Research on plasma, atomic processes, lasers, high-pressure physics, nanotechnology, [[acoustics]], and cold fusion have been conducted here. It is the home of two modern TEMs.

The [[Royden G. Derrick]] Planetarium is also in the building.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.lds.org.uk/church_world_news.php?id=141&lt;/ref&gt; This 119-seat facility with a {{convert|39|ft|m|adj=on}} acoustically-treated dome was built in 2005 to replace the smaller, outdated Sarah Barrett Summerhays Planetarium.  In the summer of 2006 a new dome was installed on the ESC's observatory to better allow for astronomical study on campus. The building also has several acoustics labs including two [[anechoic chamber]]s and two [[reverberation chamber|reverberation chambers]] for performing acoustics research.

The 5th and 6th floors of the ESC constitute the [[Orson Pratt]] Observatory.&lt;ref&gt;http://astronomy.byu.edu/opo.php&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the ESC, [[James A. Jensen]]'s dinosaur displays were often in the lobby.  However, since the building of the [[BYU Earth Science Museum]], dinosaur displays are less common.

The main lobby of the building is noted for its [[Foucault pendulum]].  It also houses a student-run restaurant, the Pendulum Court, during the fall and winter semesters.

The ESC was the first building at BYU to have an elevator.

[[File:Figleafva.jpg|thumb|A fig leaf cast in plaster used to cover the genitals of a copy of a statue of David in the [[Cast Courts (Victoria and Albert Museum)|Cast Courts of the Victoria and Albert Museum]]. In the reign of [[Queen Victoria]], display of male nudity was contentious and the Queen herself was said to find it shocking. The museum commissioned this fig leaf and kept it in readiness in case of a visit by the Queen or other female dignitaries: the fig leaf was then hung on the figure using a pair of hooks. Today, the fig leaf is no longer used, but it is displayed in a case at the back of the cast's plinth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Mercury fig leaf.jpg|thumb|A statue of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] holding the [[caduceus]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]], with a fig leaf placed over the genitalia. The fig leaf was placed there under the more "[[chaste]]" [[Pope]]s; later, most such coverings were removed.]]

The expression "'''fig leaf'''" is widely used figuratively to convey the covering up of an act or an object that is embarrassing or distasteful with something of innocuous appearance, a [[metaphor]]ical reference to the [[Biblical]] [[Book of Genesis]], in which [[Adam and Eve]] used [[ficus|fig]] leaves to cover their [[nudity]] after eating the forbidden fruit from the [[tree of the knowledge of good and evil]]. Some paintings and statues have the genitals of their subjects covered by a representation of an actual fig leaf or similar object, either as part of the work or added afterwards for perceived modesty.

==History==

In [[Ancient Greek art]], male nakedness, including the [[genitals]], was common, although the female [[Mons pubis|vulval area]] &lt;!--anyone offended by this link may substitute [[groin]]--&gt; was generally covered in art for public display.  This tradition continued in [[Ancient Roman art]] until the conversion of the [[Roman Empire]] to [[Christianity]], when [[heroic nudity]] vanished.  During the [[Middle Ages]], only the unfortunate (most often the [[damnation|damned]]) were usually shown naked, although the depictions were then often rather explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Clark |title=The Nude, A Study in Ideal Form |year=1956 |isbn=0-691-01788-3 |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam and Eve were often shown wearing fig or other leaves, following the Biblical description.  This was especially a feature of [[Northern Renaissance]] art.

From about 1530, the developing reaction to [[Renaissance]] freedoms and excesses that led to the [[Council of Trent]] also led to a number of artworks, especially in churches or public places, being altered to reduce the amount of nudity on display.  Often, as in the famous case of [[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The Last Judgement]]'', drapery or extra branches from any nearby bush was used. This has been dubbed the "fig leaf campaign". For free-standing statues this did not work well, and carved or cast fig leaves were sometimes added, such as with the plaster copy of Michelangelo's ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' displayed in [[Victorian era]] [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David's Fig Leaf|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/stories/david/index.html|publisher=Victoria &amp; Albert Museum|accessdate=2017-02-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070603175714/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/sculpture/stories/david/index.html|archivedate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Adam and Eve panels on the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', already equipped with fig leaves by [[Jan van Eyck]],  were simply replaced with 19th-century panels copying the figures but clothed.   Many of these alterations have since been reversed, damaging some of the statues.

==Modern day==
[[File:Falk,_Benjamin_J._(1853-1925)_-_Eugen_Sandow_(1867-1925)-_1894.jpg|thumb|right|275px|In this photo, Sandow portrays ''[[The Dying Gaul]]'', a pose taken from an ancient Roman sculpture.]]

[[Eugen Sandow]], often considered the first modern-day [[bodybuilder]], was an admirer of the human physique, and in addition to strongman [[sideshow]]s; he performed "muscle displays" by posing in the nude — save for a fig leaf that he would don in imitation of statues he had seen in [[Italy]] as a boy.&lt;ref name=sandow&gt;{{cite web |last= Anderson |first= R. Christian |url= http://www.sandowmuseum.com/page7.html |title= Sandow Wearing a Figleaf |publisher= SandowMuseum.com |accessdate= 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metaphorical use==
[[File:Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''[[The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden]]'', by [[Masaccio]], before and after restoration. It was painted in 1425, covered up in 1680, and restored in 1980.]]

The expression ''fig leaf'' has a [[pejorative]] [[metaphor]]ical sense meaning a flimsy or minimal cover for anything or behaviour that might be considered shameful, with the implication that the cover is only a token gesture and the truth is obvious to all who choose to see it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7746088.stm |title=Cable derides 'fig leaf' tax cuts |publisher=news.bbc.co.uk |accessdate=2010-09-16 | date=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A metaphorical fig leaf is something visible but innocuous, as against a [[coverup]] in which the existence of something may be entirely hidden.

In the context of negotiation, an offer might be characterized as a "fig leaf" if that offer is actually a ploy to conceal a sinister plan.

'''Cultural heritage tourism''' (or just '''heritage tourism''' or '''diaspora tourism''') is a branch of [[tourism]] oriented towards the [[cultural heritage]] of the location where tourism is occurring. 

The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in the United States defines heritage tourism as "traveling to experience the places, artifacts and activities that authentically represent the stories and people of the past",&lt;ref name="nthp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Tourism|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/information-center/economics-of-revitalization/heritage-tourism/#.Uz7tU1flvqE|publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "heritage tourism can include cultural, historic and natural resources".&lt;ref name="nthp"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[Culture]] has always been a major object of travel, as the development of the [[Grand Tour]] from the 16th century onwards attests. In the 20th century, some people have claimed, culture ceased to be the objective of tourism: tourism is now culture. Cultural attractions play an important role in tourism at all levels, from the global highlights of world culture to attractions that underpin local identities. (Richards, 1996)&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |last= Richards |first= Greg |title= Production and consumption of European Cultural Tourism. Annals of Tourism Research | page = |year= 1996 |publisher= Tillburg University Press |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Weiler and Hall, culture, heritage and the arts have long contributed to appeal of tourist destination. However, in recent years 'culture' has been rediscovered as an important marketing tool to attract those travellers with special interests in heritage and arts. 

According to the Hollinshead, cultural heritage tourism defines as cultural heritage tourism is the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry because there is a trend toward an increase specialization among tourists. This trend is evident in the rise in the volume of tourists who seek adventure, culture, history, [[archaeology]] and interaction with local people.

Cultural heritage tourism is important for various reasons; it has a positive economic and social impact, it establishes and reinforces identity, it helps preserve the cultural heritage, with culture as an instrument it facilitates harmony and understanding among people, it supports culture and helps renew tourism (Richards, 1996). As Benjamin 
Porter and [[Noel B. Salazar]] have ethnographically documented, however, cultural heritage tourism can also create tensions and even conflict between the different stakeholders involved (Porter and Salazar 2005).&lt;ref name="Porter and Salazar"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=Porter, Benjamin W. and Noel B. Salazar
 |year=2005
 |title=Heritage tourism, conflict, and the public interest
 |journal=International Journal of Heritage Studies
 |volume=11
 |issue=5
 |doi=10.1080/13527250500337397
 |pages=361–370
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural heritage tourism has a number of objectives that must be met within the context of [[sustainable development]] such as; the conservation of cultural resources, accurate  interpretation of resources, authentic visitors experience, and the stimulation of the earned revenues of cultural resources. We can see, therefore, that cultural heritage tourism is not only concerned with identification, management and protection of the heritage values but it must also be involved in understanding the impact of tourism on communities and regions, achieving economic and social benefits, providing financial resources for protection, as well as marketing and promotion. ([[J. M. Fladmark]], 1994)

Heritage tourism involves visiting historical or industrial sites that may include old [[canal]]s, [[railway]]s, battlegrounds, etc. The overall purpose is to gain an appreciation of the past. It also refers to the marketing of a location to members of a [[diaspora]] who have distant family roots there.

==Immigration==
[[Decolonization]] and [[immigration]] form the major background of much contemporary heritage tourism. Falling travel costs have also made heritage tourism possible for more people.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, T. (2007). ''Post-Conflict Heritage, Postcolonial Tourism: Tourism, Politics and Development at Angkor''. Routledge. {{ISBN|041543095X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible form involves religious travel or [[pilgrimage]]s. Many [[Catholics]] from around the world come to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and other sites such as [[Lourdes]] or [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]]. [[Islam]] commands its followers to take the ''[[hajj]]'' to [[Mecca]], thus differentiating it somewhat from tourism in the usual sense, though the trip can also be a culturally important event for the pilgrim.&lt;ref&gt;Basu, P. (2007). ''Highland homecomings: Genealogy and heritage tourism in the Scottish diaspora''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage tourism can also be attributed to historical events that have been dramatised to make them more entertaining. For example, a historical tour of a town or city using a theme such as ghosts or Vikings. Heritage tourism focuses on certain historical events, rather than presenting a balanced view of that historical period. Its aim may not always be the presentation of accurate historical facts, as opposed to economically developing the site and surrounding area. As a result, heritage tourism can be seen as a blend of education, entertainment, preservation and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy, D., &amp; Olsen, D. (Eds.). (2006). ''Tourism, religion and spiritual journeys''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous peoples==
[[Anthropology]] and [[Ethnology]] were two major disciplines interested by the life of aborigines, their customs and political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, M. (2001). The rise of anthropological theory: A history of theories of culture. AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, the firsts fieldworkers were not interested in expanding the colonization of main European powers, the fact was that their notes, books and field-work notes were employed by colonial officials to understand the aboriginal mind.&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo, E., &amp; Escobar, A. (2005). ‘Other Anthropologies and Anthropology Otherwise’Steps to a World Anthropologies Framework. ''[[Critique of Anthropology]]'', 25(2), 99-129.&lt;/ref&gt; From that moment on, anthropology developed a strange fascination for the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]'s culture.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, J., Dombrowski, K., Graburn, N., LeiteGoldberg, N., Phillips, R., Watkins, J., &amp; Clifford, J. (2004). Looking several ways: Anthropology and native heritage in Alaska. ''[[Current anthropology]]'', 45(1), 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of heritage and colonization were inextricably intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Starzmann, M. T. (2008). Cultural imperialism and heritage politics in the event of armed conflict: prospects for an ‘activist archaeology’. ''Archaeologies'', 4(3), 368-389.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Community Tourism (Riven No 2).webm|thumb|Community tourism in Sierra Leone: The story of a community in Sierra Leone trying to manage tourism in a socially responsible manner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Tourism - Number2 River Association, Sierra Leone|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL32A3F6F949A3F26D|work=The Vrinda Project|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Another problem with heritage tourism is the effect on indigenous peoples whose land and culture is being visited by tourists. If the indigenous people are not a part of the majority, or ruling power in the country, they may not benefit from the tourism as greatly as they should. For example, in Mexico tourism has increased because of the predicted [[end of the Maya Calendar]]. However, the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] are not benefitting from the increased traffic through the ruins and other cultural landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayans Demand Inclusion in 'Doomsday Tourism' |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/01/21/mayans-demand-inclusion-doomsday-tourism-73721|work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|accessdate=4 April 2014|date=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion and facilitation ==
Heritage tourism is supported by municipalities through promotion and tourist information in many countries and their administrative units, e.g. cities as Polish [[Bydgoszcz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visit Bydgoszcz|url=http://www.visitbydgoszcz.pl/en/|work= |publisher=Bydgoszcz Information Centre (Bydgoskie Centrum Informacji)|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WarsawTour|url=http://www.warsawtour.pl/en|work= |publisher=Warsaw Tourist Office|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also many forms of presenting selected tourist topics in a harmonized way, for instance [[European Route of Brick Gothic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europäische Route der Backsteingotik|url=http://www.eurob.org/|work= |publisher=Europäische Route der Backsteingotik e.V.|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others ([[Cultural Route of the Council of Europe]]).

This is a [[comparative religion]] article which outlines the similarities and interactions between [[Hermeticism]] (or [[Hermeticism|Hermetism]]) and other  religions or philosophies.

== Christianity ==
[[File:Seven governors.jpg|left|175px|thumb|A work by [[Jakob Böhme]] illustrating a Christian take on Hermetic astrology, 1682]]
Christianity and Hermetism have interacted in such a way that controversy surrounds the nature of the influence.  Some, such as [[Richard August Reitzenstein]] believed that Hermetism had heavily influenced Christianity; while others, such as [[Marie-Joseph LaGrange]], believed that Christianity heavily influenced Hermetism; most see the exchange as more mutual.&lt;ref name="Lyman"&gt;(Lyman p. 265)&lt;/ref&gt;   Both religions hold [[redemption (religious)|redemption]], [[revelation]] and focus on the knowledge of God as the meaning of [[World population|humanity]]'s existence.  This knowledge of God comes upon a mystical experience dependent upon rebirth, the focal point of arguments for influence from one of these religions upon the other.&lt;ref name="Lyman_a"&gt;(Lyman p. 268)&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus of this rebirth are the words "Life," "Light," and "Truth" as well as a moral attitude of the seeker in his attainment of higher knowledge.  Both also share a [[dualistic cosmology|dualistic philosophy]] which comes from a shared philosophical background in popular schools of [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic]] thought.&lt;ref name="Lyman_b"&gt;(Lyman p. 269)&lt;/ref&gt;  Early Christianity and Hermetism both are [[esotericism|esoteric]] without having an excessive emphasis on secrecy, relying upon inward experience, assisted by instruction and ultimately the result of revelation by God.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 271)&lt;/ref&gt;  Former president of the [[American Academy of Religion]], Catherine L Albanese, has theorized that Hermetic thought has had a profound influence in [[Mormonism]], [[Unitarianism]], [[Universalism]], and the [[Shakers]].&lt;ref name="Neuhaus"&gt;(Neuhaus)&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century'', Lutheran Bishop James Heiser evaluated the writings of [[Marsilio Ficino]] and [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] as contributions to a “Hermetic Reformation."&lt;ref&gt;Heiser, James D., Prisci Theologi and the Hermetic Reformation in the Fifteenth Century, Repristination Press, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-4610-9382-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Fourth Gospel ===
The ''[[Fourth Gospel]]'', or ''Gospel of John'', is purported to have similarities with the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' in religious thought and religious questing.&lt;ref name="Lyman" /&gt;  There are also, however, deep differences as well.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 266)&lt;/ref&gt;

Both texts utilize the concept of [[Logos]]&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 270)&lt;/ref&gt; and emphasize that the followers of their respective religions are apart from the rest of the world, suitable for only a few followers.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman pp. 270-71)&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the two texts stress the importance of redemption, revelation, and rebirth to find knowledge of God&lt;ref name="Lyman_a" /&gt; and contain striking similarity in the wording of how moral attitudes promote higher knowledge in general.&lt;ref name="Lyman_b" /&gt;  Opposed to the basis of the contemporary [[mystery cult]]s, both texts relayed that the core of religious practice should be done internally through the personal experience of the believer rather than externally through [[sacrament]]al ritual.&lt;ref name="Lyman_c"&gt;(Lyman p. 272)&lt;/ref&gt; Dualism plays a strong part in each of the two works.&lt;ref name="Lyman_b" /&gt;

Mary Lyman also points out four distinct contrasts between the two works despite their similarities. First, that the ''Fourth Gospel'' is a homogeneous work while the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' is a work which is found in fragments which she suspects were written by many authors over a wide range of time.&lt;ref name="Lyman_c" /&gt;  Second, cosmic speculation is paramount to the Hermetic work while the fourth Gospel focuses on issues of religion.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman pp. 273-74)&lt;/ref&gt;  Third, the Hermetic text focuses on the [[asceticism]] of the day while the Fourth Gospel ignores it completely.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman pp. 274-75)&lt;/ref&gt;  Fourth, the Gospel's figures are all unique and grounds itself in the life of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] while the Hermetic text uses an "elusive literary tradition" which does little to identify or separate its characters.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 275)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though she relays that a scholar named Angus believed that the two would be more similar if they had the same proportion of Hermetic writings as Christian writings.&lt;ref&gt;(Lyman p. 273)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rosicrucian Concept of the Tree of Pansophia.jpg|left|175 px|thumb|A 17th century depiction of the [[Rosicrucian]] concept of the Tree of [[Pansophia]].]]

=== Mormonism ===
A theory by [[John L. Brooke]], an author and professor at [[Tufts University]], suggests that [[Mormonism]] has its roots in Hermetism and Hermeticism after following a philosophical trail from Renaissance [[Europe]].  The early Mormons, most notably [[Joseph Smith]], were linked with magic, [[alchemy]], [[Freemasonry]], [[divination|divining]] and "other elements of radical religion" prior to Mormonism.  Brooke attests correlations with the view that spirit and matter are one and the same, the covenant of [[celestial marriage]], and the ability of humanity to become deified or ultimately perfect.&lt;ref name="Barlow"&gt;(Barlow)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, Brooke argues that Mormonism can only be understood in conjunction with the occult and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]-era sectarian idea of [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restoration]].  He sees ties to Hermeticism in Mormon support for [[Pelagianism]], [[communitarianism]], [[polygamy]] and [[Dispensationalism]].  He does however digress that there was a change since the 1860s in the [[LDS Church]] which has widely removed Hermetic influence.&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;  Catherine L Albanese picked up on Brooke's work and further claims that Smith's heavenly realm is derived from [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s Divine Man and Hermeticism in general, linking it in with several [[United States|American]] Christian movements which move Christianity in odd directions.&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

However, scholars at the LDS-owned [[Brigham Young University]] have denounced Brooke's work and even scolded the publisher, [[Cambridge University Press]], for printing it{{verification needed|date=March 2015}}.  Philip I Barlow criticizes the work as carelessly seeking out relations to Hermeticism which Brooke knows better than Mormonism, and believes that Brooke's links to Hermeticism can be explained away with "a particular and selectively literal reading of the Bible."&lt;ref name="Barlow" /&gt;  Albanese was criticised by Richard J Neuhaus as having denied Christianity the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] in order to minimize its influence and that she is avoiding [[theology]] by calling her book a [[cultural history]].  Albanese believes that the metaphysical denial in scholarly research is due to its strong [[feminism|feminist]] qualities.  Neuhaus believes American Christianity is more Gnostic in nature than Hermetic.&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

=== Miscellaneous ===
Albanese portends that several Christian denominations were affected by Hermeticism.  The Shakers had been influenced in their belief of a dual God, being both male and female: Heavenly Father and Holy Mother Wisdom.  She claims that Universalism was a clear mix of Christianity and Hermeticism where they come together, much like Rosicrucianism.&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

== Gnosticism ==
Hermeticism is closely related to [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref name="Hoeller"&gt;Stephan A. Hoeller, [http://www.gnosis.org/hermes.htm ''On the Trail of the Winged God. Hermes and Hermeticism Throughout the Ages'']&lt;/ref&gt; Both flourished in the same period in [[Alexandria]], in the same spiritual climate,&lt;ref name="Hoeller" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 17)&lt;/ref&gt; sharing the goal of the soul escaping from the material realm through true understanding, and emphasizing personal knowledge of God.&lt;ref name="Hoeller" /&gt; Both were part of the third pillar of Western culture; representing the balance between [[Greek culture|Greek]] [[rationality]] and [[Bible|biblical faith]] along with the [[Cathar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek and Hanegraaff p. vii)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both groups saw the fundamental relationship between God and man was found through [[gnosis]] in a goal to "see" God and in some instances become one with God.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Gnostics, however, felt that there was something seriously wrong with ''[[The All#Nous|Nous]]'', a part of The All;&lt;ref&gt;(Horgan p. 41)&lt;/ref&gt; to them, it seemed that the concept could be stretched so far as to say that by bringing the world into existence, God had to remove himself from it at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;(Horgan pp. 39-40)&lt;/ref&gt;  They also differed on the basis of [[theology]], [[cosmology]], and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from ''Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times'', p. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;  Though both agreed in God's transcendence over the Universe, Hermetists believed that God could still be comprehended through philosophical reasoning, in agreement with philosophers and Christian theologians, but Gnostics felt God was completely unknowable.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Gnostics indulged in [[mythology|mythological]] references often, Hermetic texts are generally void of mythology,&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; with ''[[Poimandres]]'' as an exception.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 12-13)&lt;/ref&gt;  Hermetism is optimistic about God, while many forms of Christian Gnosticism are pessimistic about [[demiurge|the creator]] (a different being from [[monad (Gnosticism)|their conception of God]]):&lt;ref name="Hoeller" /&gt; Several Christian Gnostic sects saw the [[Cosmos]] were the product of an evil creator and thus evil itself, while Hermetists saw the Cosmos as a beautiful creation in the image of God.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 9-10)&lt;/ref&gt;  Both view that mankind was originally divine and has become entrapped in the material world, a slave to passion and distracted from divine nature.  However, the Gnostics often held a pessimistic view of mankind as a result while the Hermetic belief is generally positive towards mankind just the same.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 11-12)&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, Hermetists believed that the human body was not bad in itself, but materialistic impulses such as [[Sexual attraction|sexual desire]] were the cause of ''evil'' in the world.&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times pp. 16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Islam ==
In 830 CE, a group of Hermetic pagans in [[Harran]] needed protection by being either Muslim, Christian, Jewish, or [[Sabians|Sabian]].  They took the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] as their scripture and [[Hermes Trismegistus]] as their prophet, and decided to call themselves Sabians.  As no one was sure what the [[Qur'an]] meant by Sabian, they were accepted as being such having a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] [[scripture]] and a [[prophet]].  This group played a large role in Baghdad's intellectual life from 856-1050.&lt;ref&gt;(Churton pp. 26-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

The most famous of the Harranian Sabians was [[Thabit ibn Qurra]], who made great advances in [[alchemy]], [[astronomy]], and [[mathematics]], citing his paganism as the reason for his ability.&lt;ref&gt;(Churton pp. 27-28)&lt;/ref&gt; The author Antoine Faivre theorizes that Hermes Trismegistus is mentioned in the Qu'ran as well, under the name of [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]].  ([http://www.submission.info/servlet/qtbrowse?pickthall=true&amp;yusufali=true&amp;shakir=true&amp;arabic=true&amp;chapter=19&amp;verseBegin=56&amp;verseEnd=56 19:56], [http://www.submission.info/servlet/qtbrowse?pickthall=true&amp;yusufali=true&amp;shakir=true&amp;arabic=true&amp;chapter=19&amp;verseBegin=57&amp;verseEnd=57 19:57]) Idris is also identified with Enoch,&lt;ref name="Faivre"&gt;(Faivre 1995 pp.19-20)&lt;/ref&gt; who is also identified with Hermes.&lt;ref&gt;(Hall The Secret Teachings of All Ages p. 94)&lt;/ref&gt;  He is called "Thrice Wise," relating to Hermes' title "Thrice Great."&lt;ref name="Faivre" /&gt;

[[Khalid ibn Yazid]] was an [[Umayyad]] prince, who took an interest in alchemy early in Islamic history. The works of [[Jabir ibn Hayyan]] would be heavily influenced by Hermetic philosophy, as would [[Ismailism|Ismaili]] beliefs and theology.

== Judaism ==
The relationship between [[Judaism]] and Hermetism has been one of mutual influence and a subject of controversy within the Jewish religion.&lt;ref name="Lelli"&gt;(Lelli)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Middle Ages ===

[[File:Complex qaballah.jpg|left|175px|thumb|A complex array of Qaballah [[Sephiroth (Kabbalah)|Sephiroth]] by [[Christian Knorr von Rosenroth]], 1684]]

This identification paved the way for the exchange and melding of ideas between Judaism and Hermetism during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;  The most prominent interrelation between the two systems is in the development of [[Kabbalah]] which developed into three separate brands: a [[Jewish Kabbalah|Jewish]] stream, a [[Christian Kabbalah|Christian]] stream (''[[Kabbalah|Cabala]]'' in Christianity), and a [[Hermetic Kabbalah|Hermetic]] stream (''[[Qabalah]]'' in Hermeticism).&lt;ref name="Leslie"&gt;(Leslie)&lt;/ref&gt;  Medieval Hermetism, aside from [[alchemy]], is often seen as analogous to and was heavily influenced by these Kabbalistic ideas.&lt;ref name="Leslie" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Regardie p. 15)&lt;/ref&gt;

Hermetism and Kabbalah arose together in the 12th and 13th centuries.  The [[Practical Kabbalah]] also relied upon magic and astrology but focused more on the Hebrew language in its incantations than the general language of Hermetism in general.&lt;ref&gt;(Wieczynski p. 22)&lt;/ref&gt;

Secondly, Jewish scholars of the Middle Ages attempted to make use of treatises on [[astrology]], [[medicine]] and [[theurgy]] as a justification for practicing natural magic forbidden by a number of commandments in the [[Torah]] and reinforced by prophetic books codified by [[rabbi]]nic authorities.  They noted the wonders performed by celebrated biblical figures such as the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchs]] and King Solomon and which were seen as a God-given and condoned use of natural magic.  They attributed these arts to divine knowledge imparted by Jewish heroes to [[gentiles]] such as the [[India]]ns, [[Babylon]]ians, [[Egypt]]ians, and [[Greece|Greeks]], and felt that by approaching [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] from a religious standpoint would legitimize their use of the sciences.  In particular, they believed the Hermetic teachings to have its origins in ancient Jewish sources.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

These Jewish scholars, particularly the ones who distrusted [[Term logic|Aristotelian rationality]], looked to Hermetism as a backing to discuss theological interpretation of the [[Torah]] and the [[ten commandments]].  Fabrizo Lelli writes: "As for Christians and Muslims, so likewise for Jews, Hermetism was an alternative to Aristotelianism--the likeliest prospect, in fact, for integrating an alien system into their religion.  This was because the response of the [[Hermetica]] to intellectual problems was generally [[Theosophy (disambiguation)|theosophical]]."&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

In the use of these Hermetic treatises, these Jewish scholars, though at times inadvertently, introduced Hermetic ideas into Jewish thought.  [[Shabbetay Donnolo]]'s 10th century commentary on the ''[[Sefer Yezirah]]'' shows Hermetic influence, as well as the 13th century texts later compiled into the ''[[Sefer ha-Zohar]]'', and in the contemporary Kabbalistic works of [[Abraham Abulafia]] as well as of other Jewish thinkers influenced by Kabbalah&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt; such as [[Isaac Abravanel]] who used Hermetic Qabalah to affirm the superiority of Judaism.&lt;ref&gt;(Skalli)&lt;/ref&gt;  Lelli suggests that it was natural for these Jewish Kabbalists to elevate Hermetic teachings to a major role in Jewish thought in a time when they began to produce their own "antirationalist--exegesis of scripture."  This was despite the fact that many Hermetic works were ascribed to [[Aristotle]] in the time through [[pseudepigrapha]]; these scholars saw that as a justification to give the same elevated authority to the medical, astronomical, and magical Hermetic texts.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

However, most Medieval Jewish scholars aware of the Hermetic tradition did not mention Hermetism explicitly, but rather referred to them through Hermetic ideas that were borrowed from Islam or brought Hermeticism up only to reject it.  While scholars such as [[Moses ibn Ezra]], [[Bahya ibn Paquda]], [[Judah ha-Levi]], and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]] specifically brought up Hermeticism to integrate into their philosophies, others such as [[Moses ben Maimon]] (Maimonides) specifically rejected anything Hermetic as being responsible for counterparadigmic views of God.  Maimonides warned his readers against what he viewed as the degenerative effect of Hermetic ideas, particularly those of the Sabians, and was effective in persuading many Jewish thinkers away from Hermetic integration, known as Hebrew Hermetism.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

Scholars, such as Abraham ibn Ezra, felt justified in invoking the authority of Hermes to offer esoteric explanations of Jewish ritual.  This culminated in a wide use of Hermetic texts for the use of theurgy and [[Amulet|talisman]] construction.  The Jewish version of the theurgic practice of drawing divine spirits down to Earth was horadat haruhaniyut, "the lowering of spirituality."  Books such as the ''[[Sefer Mafteah Shlomoh]]'', ''[[Sefer Meleket Muskelet]]'', ''[[Sefer ha-Tamar]]'' and ''[[Sefer Hermes]]''.  The Hermetic texts most valued by Jewish scholars were those which dealt with astrology, medicine, and astral magic; however shunned by Maimonides as dangerous and destructive.&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

=== Renaissance ===
[[File:Rabbi Abraham Eleazar.jpg|right|175px|thumb|Rabbi Abraham Eleazar demonstrating the alchemical process of distillation through symbolism, 1760]]
Despite Maimonides' denunciation of Hermetism, Jewish scholars in the Renaissance struggled to reconcile his beliefs with those of the proponents of Hermetic thought within Judaism.  Renaissance scholars argued that the rationalism of Maimonides drew upon the [[prisca sapienta]] that had both Mosaic and Hermetic origins and that Abraham ibn Ezra's Commentary on the Pentateuch was evidence that they shared the same views on the relationship between [[religion]] and [[science]].&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

However, scholars such as [[Averroist Elijah del Medigo]] carried on Maimonides' crusade.  Medigo claimed that the theurgic practices of Hermetism were against the teachings of the Torah.  Others, such as [[Yohanan Alemanno]], claimed that the Hermetic teachings were part of a primordial wisdom of the ancients and put the writings of Hermes as being equal to those of King Solomon.  Hermetism was also prominent in the works of [[David Messer Leon]], [[Isaac Abravanel]], [[Judah Abravanel]], [[Elijah Hayyim]], [[Abraham Farissol]], [[Judah Moscato]] and [[Abraham Yagel]].&lt;ref name="Lelli" /&gt;

The works of [[Baruch Spinoza]] have also been ascribed a Hermetic element&lt;ref&gt;(Weststeijn)&lt;/ref&gt; and Hermetic influenced thinkers such as [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] have accepted Spinoza's version of God.&lt;ref&gt;(Lange)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ancient philosophy ==
Hermetism had a strong philosophical influence,&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from ''Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times'' p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; especially from [[Stoicism]] and [[Platonism]].&lt;ref&gt;(Van den Broek "Gnosticism and Hermetism in Antiquity" from ''Gnosis and Hermeticism: from Antiquity to Modern Times'' p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Occult ==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2008}}
Much of the Western Esoteric tradition is based on a blend of Hermeticism and the ''[[Kabbalah Ma'asit]]'', so called magical or [[practical Kabbalah]]. Occultism uses the Hermetic and Kabbalistic theory of creation and angelic/demonic forces, as a basis for ritual magic, and theurgy. Most magic theory involves the manipulation of [[Yetzirah]], the world of Formation, and letting the effect trickle down to the physical universe (in accordance to the Hermetic concept of "as above, so below"). This includes the communication and manipulation of inhabitants of Yetzirah, angelic or demonic forces. The spelling of "Qabalah", is generally referred to as the [[Hermetic Qabalah]], often having a magical or occult slant. While "Kabbalah" refers to the traditional [[Jewish Kabbalah|Jewish branch]].

These beliefs were influential in [[Europe]]an occult lore, especially from the Renaissance forward.  During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, magicians wrote grimoires which show a major influence from both Hermeticism and Kabbalah and have since become a basis for most practical occultism. In more recent times, magical orders such as The Golden Dawn have revived and revised these traditions.

== Transcendentalism ==
Catherine L Albanese theorized that [[Transcendentalism]] has Hermetic influence.  Among Transcendentalist thinkers, she especially points to [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] who has ideas of humankind transcending into deification similar to those of Joseph Smith.  She also points to the [[spiritual narcissism]] of [[Henry David Thoreau]].&lt;ref name="Neuhaus" /&gt;

== Neopaganism ==
[[Neopaganism]] is directly related to Hermeticism. The [[Renaissance]] Hermetists [[Plethon]] and [[Ficino]] are the foundation of the [[Western Mystery Tradition]] from which contemporary Neopaganism arose. [[Wicca]], one of the earliest and most famous of the Neopagan religions, honours a Goddess and a God, who are seen by some as being aspects of a single greater deity. See [[Wiccan views of divinity]]. [[Silver Ravenwolf]] expresses this in terms of the [[Hermetic Qabalah|Qabalistic]] [[Tree of Life (Kabbalah)|Tree of Life]]:

:"Down we go then, to the first two branches of the tree, right below the All. Each branch is exactly the same, one on the right side of the tree and one on the left.  Totally balanced in every respect to each other.  They represent the [[Horned God|God]] and the [[Goddess#Wicca and Neopaganism|Goddess]], or the Lord and the Lady.  Separate yet equal, together they combine into the essence of the All."&lt;ref&gt;(Ravenwolf p. 44)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravenwolf holds that the God and Goddess are merely the masculine and feminine aspects of The All, and that both in turn express themselves through sub-aspects as the gods and goddesses of the various pantheons,&lt;ref&gt;(Ravenwolf p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; just as in Hermeticism archangels, angels, and demons are all seen as embodying aspects of God.

The Hermetic use of signs, herbs, stones and animal imagery as a means for drawing down the planetary powers into such signs&lt;ref&gt;(Yates ''Giordano Bruno and the Hermetic Tradition'' p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; is mirrored in the [[sympathetic magic]] practices of Neopagan [[witchcraft]].

Amongst pagan [[white supremacist]] groups, the [[Odinist]] [[White Order of Thule]] integrates Hermetic philosophy into its indoctrination process.&lt;ref&gt;(Vysotsky)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Zoroastrianism ==
[[Zoroastrianism]] plays a large role in influencing Hermeticism.  In 525 BCE, Egypt was conquered by the [[Persian Empire]], bringing Zoroastrian ideas along with it.&lt;ref&gt;(Abel &amp; Hare p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt;  In obscure texts, Hermes claims to look to [[Zoroaster]] as a spiritual father, having learned much of the [[zodiac]] from him.  It is further said that Zoroaster had penetrated the mystery of the zodiac more than any other.&lt;ref&gt;(Powell pp. 15-16)&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, it has been suggested that Zoroaster (like so many others) and Hermes are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;(Hall ''The Secret Teachings of All Ages'' p. 516)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is possible that this was from a faked Zoroastrian text.  Theurgy is often called Zoroastrian Magic as well.&lt;ref&gt;(Garstin pp. 9-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2406">'''IMPACT''' (sometimes spelled '''Impact''') is a [[computer graphics]] architecture for [[Silicon Graphics]] [[computer workstation]]s. IMPACT Graphics was developed in 1995 and was available as a high-end graphics option on workstations released during the mid-1990s. IMPACT graphics gives the workstation real-time 2D and [[3D graphics]] rendering capability similar to that of even high-end [[Personal computer|PC]]s made well after IMPACT's introduction. IMPACT graphics systems consist of either one or two [[Geometry pipelines|Geometry Engines]] and one or two [[Raster Engine]]s in various configurations.&lt;ref name="bli2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuretech.blinkenlights.nl/i2info.html#3.3|title=Later (Newer) Indigo2 Technologies|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IMPACT graphics consists of five graphics subsystems: the Command Engine, Geometry Subsystem, Raster Engine, [[framebuffer]] and Display Subsystem. IMPACT Graphics can produce resolutions up to 1600 x 1200 pixels with 32-bit color&lt;ref name="glenerz-impact"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgistuff.g-lenerz.de/graphics/impact.html|title=Impact graphics options by Gerhard Lenerz|archivedate=2005-01-28|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050128090515/http://sgistuff.g-lenerz.de/graphics/impact.html|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can also process unencoded [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] analog [[television]] signals. &lt;!-- The IMPACT Graphics system is made up of ??? [[daughterboard]]s that plug into the main workstation [[motherboard]]. --&gt;

IMPACT graphics subsystems come in three configurations for [[SGI Indigo2|SGI Indigo2 IMPACT]] workstations: Solid IMPACT, High IMPACT, and Maximum IMPACT. The equivalent configurations also exist for the [[SGI Octane]] workstation but are referred to as SI, SSI, and MXI (I-series). Later Octane workstations used a similar configuration but with updated [[application-specific integrated circuit|ASIC]] chips and are referred to as SE, SSE, and MXE (E-series). IMPACT uses [[Rambus]] [[RDRAM]] for texture memory.&lt;ref name="bloct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuretech.blinkenlights.nl/octnarch.html|title=Octane Architecture|accessdate=2016-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IMPACT graphics architecture was superseded by SGI's [[SGI VPro|VPro]] graphics architecture in 1997.

{{Information science}}
'''Informatics''' is a branch of [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]]. It involves the practice of [[information processing]] and the engineering of [[information system]]s, and as an [[discipline (academia)|academic field]] it is an [[applied science|applied]] form of [[information science]]. The field considers the interaction between humans and information alongside the construction of interfaces, organisations, technologies and systems. As such, the field of informatics has great breadth and encompasses many subspecialties, including disciplines of [[computer science]], [[information systems]], [[information technology]] and [[statistics]]. Since the advent of computers, individuals and organizations increasingly process information digitally. This has led to the study of informatics with computational, mathematical, biological, cognitive and social aspects, including study of the social impact of information technologies.

==Etymology==
{{see also|Computer science#Etymology}}

In 1956 the German computer scientist [[Karl Steinbuch]] coined the word ''Informatik'' by publishing a paper called ''Informatik: Automatische Informationsverarbeitung'' ("Informatics: Automatic Information Processing").&lt;ref&gt;[http://helios.informatik.uni-kl.de/euology.pdf Karl Steinbuch Eulogy – Bernard Widrow, Reiner Hartenstein, Robert Hecht-Nielsen ]&lt;/ref&gt; The English term ''Informatics'' is sometimes understood as meaning the same as [[computer science]]. The German word ''Informatik'' is usually translated to English as  ''computer science''.

The [[French language|French]] term ''informatique'' was coined in 1962 by [[Philippe Dreyfus]]&lt;ref&gt;Dreyfus, Phillipe. ''L’informatique.'' Gestion, Paris, June 1962, pp. 240–41&lt;/ref&gt; together with various translations—informatics (English), also proposed independently and simultaneously by [[Walter F. Bauer]] and associates who co-founded ''[[Dataproducts#Informatics|Informatics Inc.]]'', and ''informatica'' (Italian, Spanish, Romanian, Portuguese, Dutch), referring to the application of computers to store and process information.

The term was coined as a combination of "information" and "automatic" to describe the science of [[automation|automating]] information interactions.
The morphology—''informat''-ion + -''ics''—uses "the accepted form for names of sciences, as conics, linguistics, optics, or matters of practice, as economics, politics, tactics",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and so, linguistically, the meaning extends easily to encompass both the science of information and the practice of information processing.

==History==
{{see also|History of computer science|History of computing}}

The culture of library science promotes policies and procedures for managing information that fosters the relationship between library science and the development of information science to provide benefits for health informatics development; which is traced to the 1950s with the beginning of computer uses in healthcare (Nelson &amp; Staggers p.4).  Early practitioners interested in the field soon learned that there were no formal education programs set up to educate them on the informatics science until the late 1960s and early 1970s. Professional development began to emerge, playing a significant role in the development of health informatics (Nelson &amp;Staggers p.7)
According to Imhoff et al., 2001, healthcare informatics is not only the application of computer technology to problems in healthcare but covers all aspects of generation, handling, communication, storage, retrieval, management, analysis, discovery, and synthesis of data information and knowledge in the entire scope of healthcare. Furthermore, they stated that the primary goal of health informatics can be distinguished as follows: To provide solutions for problems related to data, information, and knowledge processing. To study general principles of processing data information and knowledge in medicine and healthcare.

This new term was adopted across Western Europe, and, except in English, developed a meaning roughly translated by the English ‘computer science’, or ‘computing science’. [[Alexander Ivanovich Mikhailov|Mikhailov]] advocated the Russian term ''informatika'' (1966), and the English ''informatics'' (1967), as names for the ''theory of scientific information'', and argued for a broader meaning, including study of the use of information technology in various communities (for example, scientific) and of the interaction of technology and human organizational structures.
:''Informatics is the discipline of science which investigates the structure and properties (not specific content) of scientific information, as well as the regularities of scientific information activity, its theory, history, methodology and organization.''&lt;ref&gt;Mikhailov, A.I., Chernyl, A.I., and Gilyarevskii, R.S. (1966) "Informatika – novoe nazvanie teorii naučnoj informacii." ''Naučno tehničeskaja informacija'', 12, pp. 35–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage has since modified this definition in three ways. First, the restriction to scientific information is removed, as in business informatics or legal informatics. Second, since most information is now digitally stored, computation is now central to informatics. Third, the representation, processing and communication of information are added as objects of investigation, since they have been recognized as fundamental to any scientific account of information. Taking ''information'' as the central focus of study distinguishes ''informatics'' from ''[[computer science]].'' Informatics includes the study of biological and social mechanisms of information processing whereas computer science focuses on the digital computation. Similarly, in the study of representation and communication, informatics is indifferent to the substrate that carries information. For example, it encompasses the study of communication using gesture, speech and language, as well as digital communications and networking.

In the English-speaking world the term ''informatics'' was first widely used in the compound [[medical informatics]], taken to include "the cognitive, information processing, and communication tasks of medical practice, education, and research, including information science and the technology to support these tasks".&lt;ref&gt;Greenes, R.A. and Shortliffe, E.H. (1990) "Medical Informatics: An emerging discipline with academic and institutional perspectives." ''[[Journal of the American Medical Association]]'', 263(8) pp. 1114–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Many such compounds are now in use; they can be viewed as different areas of "''applied informatics''".
Indeed, "In the U.S., however, informatics is linked with applied computing, or computing in the context of another domain."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69363-why-an-informatics-degree]&lt;/ref&gt;

Informatics encompasses the study of systems that [[knowledge representation|represent]], [[information processing|process]], and [[communication|communicate]] information.
However, the [[theory of computation]] in the specific discipline of [[theoretical computer science]], which evolved from [[Alan Turing]], studies the notion of a [[complex system]] regardless of whether or not [[information]] actually exists. Since both fields process information, there is some disagreement among scientists as to field hierarchy; for example [[Arizona State University]] attempted to adopt a broader definition of informatics to even encompass [[cognitive science]] at the launch of its [https://web.archive.org/web/20061025101825/http://sci.asu.edu/index.php School of Computing and Informatics] in September 2006.

A broad interpretation of ''informatics'', as "the study of the structure, algorithms, behaviour, and interactions of natural and artificial computational systems," was introduced by the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1994 when it formed the grouping that is now its [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics|School of Informatics]]. This meaning is now (2006) increasingly used in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, at [http://www.henley.reading.ac.uk/IRC/ University of Reading], [http://www.sussex.ac.uk/informatics/ Sussex], [http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/ City University], [http://www.infc.ulst.ac.uk/ Ulster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420164145/http://www.infc.ulst.ac.uk/ |date=2006-04-20 }}, [http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/home/index.php Bradford] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060517090122/http://www.inf.brad.ac.uk/home/index.php |date=2006-05-17 }}, [http://www.informatics.manchester.ac.uk/  Manchester] and [http://www.ncl.ac.uk/iri/ Newcastle]  {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20030907164628/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/iri/ |date=2003-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 [[Research Assessment Exercise]], of the UK Funding Councils, includes a new, ''Computer Science and Informatics,'' unit of assessment (UoA),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rae.ac.uk/pubs/2006/01/docs/f23.pdf UoA 23 Computer Science and Informatics, Panel working methods]&lt;/ref&gt; whose scope is described as follows:
:''The UoA includes the study of methods for acquiring, storing, processing, communicating and reasoning about information, and the role of interactivity in natural and artificial systems, through the implementation, organisation and use of computer hardware, software and other resources. The subjects are characterised by the rigorous application of analysis, experimentation and design.''

==Academic schools and departments==
{{advert||date=September 2018}}
Academic research in the informatics area can be found in a number of disciplines such as [[computer science]], [[information technology]], [[Information and Computer Science]], [[information system]]s, business [[information management]] and [[health informatics]].

In France, the first degree level qualifications in Informatics (computer science) appeared in the mid-1960s.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In English-speaking countries, the first example of a degree level qualification in Informatics occurred in 1982 when Plymouth Polytechnic (now the [[Plymouth University|University of Plymouth]]) offered a four-year BSc(Honours) degree in Computing and Informatics – with an initial intake of only 35 students.  The course still runs today &lt;ref&gt;BSc(Hons) Computing Informatics – University of Plymouth [http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/courses/undergraduate/1926/BSc+(Hons)+Computing+Informatics/ Link]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the longest available qualification in the subject.

At the [[Indiana University School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering]] ([http://www.soic.indiana.edu Bloomington], [http://informatics.iupui.edu Indianapolis] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091009165240/http://www.informatics.ius.edu/ Southeast]), informatics is defined as "the art, science and human dimensions of information technology" and "the study, application, and social consequences of technology." It is also defined in Informatics 101, Introduction to Informatics as "the application of information technology to the arts, sciences, and professions." These definitions are widely accepted in the [[United States]], and differ from British usage in omitting the study of natural computation.

[[Texas Woman's University]] places its informatics degrees in its department of Mathematics and Computer Science within the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, though it offers interdisciplinary Health Informatics degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.twu.edu/informatics/ |title=Informatics - Texas Woman's University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informatics is presented in a generalist framework, as evidenced by their definition of informatics ("Using technology and data analytics to derive meaningful information from data for data and decision driven practice in user centered systems"), though TWU is also known for its nursing and health informatics programs.

At the [[University of California, Irvine]] [http://www.ics.uci.edu/informatics/ Department of Informatics], informatics is defined as "the interdisciplinary study of the design, application, use and impact of information technology.  The discipline of informatics is based on the recognition that the design of this technology is not solely a technical matter, but must focus on the relationship between the technology and its use in real-world settings. That is, informatics designs solutions in context, and takes into account the social, cultural and organizational settings in which computing and information technology will be used."

At the [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]] [http://informatics.umich.edu/ Informatics interdisciplinary major], informatics is defined as "the study of information and the ways information is used by and affects human beings and social systems. The major involves coursework from the College of Literature, Science and the Arts, where the Informatics major is housed, as well as the School of Information and the College of Engineering.  Key to this growing field is that it applies both technological and social perspectives to the study of information. Michigan's interdisciplinary approach to teaching Informatics gives a solid grounding in contemporary computer programming, mathematics, and statistics, combined with study of the ethical and social science aspects of complex information systems. Experts in the field help design new information technology tools for specific scientific, business, and cultural needs."  Michigan offers four curricular tracks within the informatics degree to provide students with increased expertise. These four track topics include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://informatics.umich.edu/informatics/curriculum |publisher=University of Michigan |title=Curriculum - Informatics - University of Michigan |accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Internet Informatics'': An applied track in which students experiment with technologies behind Internet-based information systems and acquire skills to map problems to deployable Internet-based solutions. This track will replace Computational Informatics in Fall 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concentration: Informatics - LSA Students - University of Michigan|url=http://www.lsa.umich.edu/students/academicsrequirements/concentrationsminors/informatics/concentrationinformatics|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130107070418/http://www.lsa.umich.edu/students/academicsrequirements/concentrationsminors/informatics/concentrationinformatics|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 January 2013|website=archive.li|date=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data Mining &amp; Information Analysis: Integrates the collection, analysis, and visualization of complex data and its critical role in research, business, and government to provide students with practical skills and a theoretical basis for approaching challenging data analysis problems.
* ''Life Science Informatics'': Examines artificial information systems, which has helped scientists make great progress in identifying core components of organisms and ecosystems.
* Social Computing:  Advances in computing have created opportunities for studying patterns of social interaction and developing systems that act as introducers, recommenders, coordinators, and record-keepers. Students, in this track, craft, evaluate, and refine social software computer applications for engaging technology in unique social contexts. This track will be phased out in Fall 2013 in favor of the new bachelor of science in information. This will be the first undergraduate degree offered by the School of Information since its founding in 1996.  The School of Information already contains a Master's program, Doctorate program, and a professional master's program in conjunction with the School of Public Health.  The BS in Information at the University of Michigan will be the first curriculum program of its kind in the United States, with the first graduating class to emerge in 2015.  Students will be able to apply for this unique degree in 2013 for the 2014 Fall semester; the new degree will be a stem off of the most popular Social Computing track in the current Informatics interdisciplinary major in LSA.  Applications will be open to upper-classmen, juniors and seniors, along with a variety of information classes available for first and second year students to gauge interest and value in the specific sector of study.  The degree was approved by the University on June 11, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UMSI plans new undergraduate degree|url=http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/press/umsi-plans-new-undergraduate-degree|work=University of Michigan School of Information|accessdate=11 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221221859/http://www.si.umich.edu/newsandevents/press/umsi-plans-new-undergraduate-degree|archivedate=21 December 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Along with a new degree in the School of Information, there has also been the first and only chapter of an Informatics Professional Fraternity, Kappa Theta Pi, chartered in Fall 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kappa Theta Pi (KTP)|url=https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/kappathetapi|accessdate=19 February 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130902055835/https://maizepages.umich.edu/organization/kappathetapi|archivedate=2 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[University of Washington, Seattle]] [https://ischool.uw.edu/academics/informatics Informatics Undergraduate Program], Informatics is an undergraduate program offered by the [https://ischool.uw.edu/ Information School]. Bachelor of Science in Informatics is described as "[a] program that focuses on computer systems from a user-centered perspective and studies the structure, behavior and interactions of natural and artificial systems that store, process and communicate information. Includes instruction in information sciences, human computer interaction, information system analysis and design, telecommunications structure and information architecture and management." Washington offers three degree options as well as a custom track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ischool.uw.edu/academics/informatics/degree-options |publisher=University of Washington Information School |title=Degree Options |accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data Science Option: Data Science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that works to extract knowledge or insight from data. It combines fields such as information science, computer science, statistics, design, and social science.
* Human-Computer Interaction: The iSchool’s work in human-computer interaction (HCI) strives to make information and computing useful, usable, and accessible to all. The Informatics HCI option allows one to blend your technical skills and expertise with a broader perspective on how design and development work impacts users. Courses explore the design, construction, and evaluation of interactive technologies for use by individuals, groups, and organizations, and the social implications of these systems. This work encompasses user interfaces, accessibility concerns, new design techniques and methods for interactive systems and collaboration. Coursework also examines the values implicit in the design and development of technology.
* Information Architecture: Information architecture (IA) is a crucial component in the development of successful Web sites, software, intranets, and online communities. Architects structure the underlying information and its presentation in a logical and intuitive way so that people can put information to use. As an Informatics major with an IA option, one will master the skills needed to organize and label information for improved navigation and search. One will build frameworks to effectively collect, store and deliver information. One will also learn to design the databases and XML storehouses that drive complex and interactive websites, including the navigation, content layout, personalization, and transactional features of the site.
* Information Assurance and Cybersecurity: Information Assurance and Cybersecurity (IAC) is the practice of creating and managing safe and secure systems. It is crucial for organizations public and private, large and small. In the IAC option, one will be equipped with the knowledge to create, deploy, use, and manage systems that preserve individual and organizational privacy and security. This tri-campus concentration leverages the strengths of the Information School, the Computing and Software Systems program at UW Bothell, and the Institute of Technology at UW Tacoma. After a course in the technical, policy, and management foundations of IAC, one may take electives at any campus to learn such specialties as information assurance policy, secure coding, or networking and systems administration.
* Custom (Student-Designed Concentration): Students may choose to develop their own concentration, with approval from the academic adviser. Student-designed concentrations are created out of a list of approved courses and also result in the Bachelor of Science degree.

===Organizational informatics===
{{main article|Organizational informatics}}
One of the most significant areas of application of informatics is that of organizational informatics. Organizational informatics is fundamentally interested in the application of information, information systems and ICT within organisations of various forms including private sector, public sector and voluntary sector organisations.&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2002). Information Systems: an introduction to informatics in Organisations. Palgrave, Basingstoke, UK. {{ISBN|0-333-96390-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beynon-Davies P. (2009). Business Information Systems. Palgrave, Basingstoke, UK. {{ISBN|978-0-230-20368-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, organisational informatics can be seen to be a sub-category of [[social informatics]] and a super-category of [[business informatics]]. Organizational informatics are also present in the computer science and information technology industry. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Jewish Historical Institute''' ({{lang-pl|Żydowski Instytut Historyczny}} or ''ŻIH'', {{lang-yi|‏ייִדישער היסטאָרישער אינסטיטוט‎}}) also known as the [[Emanuel Ringelblum]] Jewish Historical Institute, is a research foundation in [[Warsaw]], Poland, primarily dealing with the [[history of Jews in Poland]].

==History==
The Jewish Historical Institute was created in 1947 as a continuation of the Central Jewish Historical Commission, founded in 1944. The Jewish Historical Institute Association is the corporate body responsible for the building and the Institute’s holdings. The Institute falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage. In 2009 it was named after [[Emanuel Ringelblum]]. The institute is a repository of documentary materials relating to the Jewish historical presence in Poland. It is also a centre for academic research, study and the dissemination of knowledge about the history and culture of Polish Jewry.&lt;ref name=JHI&gt;[http://www.jhi.pl/en/institute/history The Jewish Historical Institute, homepage.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The most valuable part of the collection is the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] Archive, known as the Ringelblum Archive (collected by the [[Oyneg Shabbos (group)|Oyneg Shabbos]]). It contains about 6000 documents (about 30 000 individual pieces of paper).&lt;ref name=JHI/&gt;

[[Image:Exhibition Jewish Historical Institute Warsaw.JPG|thumb|left|An exhibition on the first floor]]

Other important collections concerning World War II include testimonies (mainly of Jewish survivors of the Holocaust), memoirs and diaries, documentation of the Joint and Jewish Self-Help (welfare organizations active in Poland under the occupation), and documents from the Jewish Councils (Judenräte). The section on the documentation of Jewish historical sites holds about 40 thousand photographs concerning Jewish life and culture in Poland.&lt;ref name=JHI/&gt;

The Institute has published a series of documents from the Ringelblum Archive, as well as numerous wartime memoirs and diaries.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan Stach ''Geschichtsschreibung und politische Vereinnahmungen: Das Jüdische Historische Institut in Warschau 1947-1968'', in: Jahrbuch des Simon-Dubnow-Instituts / Simon Dubnow Institute Yearbook VII (2008), 401-431, {{ISBN|978-3-525-36934-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, for over 60 years now, the Institute has been publishing an academic journal renamed in 2001 as ''The Jewish History Quarterly'', registered on the Master Journal List of outstanding academic journals in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish Historical Institute, ''[http://www.jhi.pl/en/blog/2013-03-01-the-jewish-history-quarterly The Jewish History Quarterly.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Paweł Śpiewak]], a Professor of Sociology at [[Warsaw University]] and former politician, was nominated as the Director of the Jewish Historical Institute by [[Bogdan Zdrojewski]], Minister of Culture and National Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Uncredited, [http://www.jewishinstitute.org.pl/en/home/index/0.html Change at the top] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203214108/http://www.jewishinstitute.org.pl/en/home/index/0.html |date=February 3, 2009 }}; Jewish Historical Institute.

{{main|Mediterranean Basin|Altitudinal zonation}}

The climate and ecology of land immediately surrounding the [[Mediterranean Sea]] is influenced by several factors. Overall, the land has a [[Mediterranean climate]], with mild, rainy winters and hot, dry summers. The climate induces characteristic [[Mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub]] vegetation. Plant life immediately near the Mediterranean is in the Mediterranean Floristic region, while mountainous areas further from the sea supports the Sub-Mediterranean Floristic province.

An important factor in the local climate and ecology of the lands in the Mediterranean basin is the elevation: an increase of elevation by {{convert|1000|m|ft}} causes the average air temperature to drop by 5 C/ 9 F and decreases the amount of water that can be held by the atmosphere by 30%. This decrease in temperature and increase in rainfall result in altitudinal zonation, where the land can be divided into [[life zones]] of similar climate and ecology, depending on elevation.

Mediterranean vegetation shows a variety of ecological adaptations to hot and dry summer conditions. As Mediterranean vegetation differ both in species and composition from temperate vegetation, ecologists use special terminology for the Mediterranean altitudinal zonation: 
* Eu-mediterranean belt: 20- 16&amp;nbsp;°C (avg annual temperature)
* Sub-mediterranean belt: 15- 12&amp;nbsp;°C
* Hilly region: 11- 8&amp;nbsp;°C
* Mountainous belt: 7- 4&amp;nbsp;°C
* Alpine belt: 3- 0&amp;nbsp;°C
* Subnival belt: 0- minus 4&amp;nbsp;°C &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Even within the Mediterranean Basin, differences in aridity alter the life zones as a function of elevation. For example, the wetter [[Maritime Alps|Maritime]] and [[Dinaric Alps]] have a ''North-Mediterranean'' zonation pattern, while the southern [[Apennine Mountains]] and the Spanish [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]] have a moderate ''Eu-Mediterranean'' zonation pattern. Finally, the drier [[Atlas Mountains]] of Africa and [[Taurus Mountains]] of the Near East have a ''Xero-Mediterranean'' pattern.&lt;ref name="Horvat et al."&gt;{{cite book

In this zone Mastic (''[[Pistacia lentiscus]]''), wild [[Olive]] (''Olea europaea'') and Mediterranean [[Smilax]] or Common Smilax (''Smilax aspera'') grow. Poor sandy soils have few species with the [[Holm Oak]] (''Quercus ilex''), the Common Junipers, (''[[Juniperus communis]]''), ''Daphne gnidium'' and Etruscan honeysuckle (''[[Lonicera etrusca]]'').
* '''Supramediterranean zone''' (Mid-Montane) {{convert|1300|to|1900|m|ft}} elevation. The summers are here temperate and frosts and snow are frequent in winter. ''Quercus pyrenaica'' predominates, Portuguese Oak ([[Quercus faginea]]) and [[maple]] appear too; these three species make up the [[forest]]. More frequent are the [[Sessile Oak]]s (''Quercus petraea'') between 1,300 and 1,750 m. The Sessile Oaks are dominated by the [[Holm Oak]]s (Quercus ilex) and, depending on soil and altitude, by bushes as [[Common Juniper]] (''Juniperus oxycedrus''), barberry (''Berberis hispanica''), (''[[Daphne]] gnidium''), Butcher's broom (''[[Ruscus aculeatus]]'') and Common Hawthorn (''[[Crataegus monogyna]]'') over basic soils.
* '''Oromediterranean zone''' (Subalpine) {{convert|1900|to|2700|m|ft}} elevation. In this zone, coniferous plants and sparse ''[[Juniperus thurifera]]'' appear. The vegetation is composed by trees and bushes ([[Scots Pine]] (''Pinus sylvestris''), [[Savin Juniper]] (''Juniperus sabina''), ''[[Juniperus communis]] subsp. hemisphaerica'', ''[[Prunus ramburii]]'') and other bushes (''Vella spinosa'', ''Erinacea anthyllis'', ''Bupleurum spinosum''). On better soils the Common Juniper, ''[[Juniperus communis]]'' and ''[[Cytisus]]'' appears, forming communities with ''Arenaria imbricata'', ''Festuca indigesta''. The endemic flora is present too: ''Genista versicolor'', ''Arenaria pungens'', ''Potentilla nevadensis''.
* '''Cryo-oromediterranean zone''' (Alpine); {{convert|2600|to|2800|m|ft}} elevation. [[Woody plant|Ligneous plants]] can not grow here because of the seasonal dryness typical of the Mediterranean climate and the presence of snow for more than 8 months. The vegetation has similarities to the Arctic [[tundra]], with the Mat-grass (''Nardus stricta'') as the most common species.

[[Almería]], near sea level, is an example of a Thermo-mediterranean climate, among the warmest locations on the European continent:

This is a '''list of types of funerary monument''', a physical structure that commemorates a deceased person or a group, in the latter case usually those whose deaths occurred at the same time or in similar circumstances. The funerary monument differs from a tomb or cemetery in that while it may or may not contain the body of the deceased, its primary purpose is not simply to house the remains, but to serve as a visible reminder of the dead for the living. It often features inscriptions ([[epitaph]]s) or [[funerary art]].

In [[theoretical physics]], an '''M2-brane''', is a spatially extended mathematical object ([[brane]]) that appears in [[string theory]] and in related theories (e.g. [[M-theory]], [[F-theory]]). In particular, it is a solution of eleven-dimensional [[supergravity]] which possesses a three-dimensional [[World line|world volume]].

==Description==
The M2-brane solution can be found&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/9803116 K. Stelle, "BPS Branes in Supergravity"]&lt;/ref&gt; by requiring &lt;math&gt;(Poincare)_{3}\times SO(8)&lt;/math&gt; symmetry of the solution and solving the supergravity equations of motion with the [[p-brane]] ansatz. The solution is given by a [[Metric tensor (general relativity)|metric]] and three-[[Differential form|form]] gauge field which, in isotropic coordinates, can be written as 
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{align} ds^{2}_{M2} &amp;= \left(1+\frac{q}{r^{6}}\right)^{-\frac{2}{3}}dx^{\mu} dx^{\nu}\eta_{\mu\nu} + \left(1+\frac{q}{r^{6}}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}dx^{i}dx^{j}\delta_{ij} \\
F_{i\mu_{1}\mu_{2}\mu_{3}} &amp;= \epsilon_{\mu_{1}\mu_{2}\mu_{3}} \partial_{i}\left(1+\frac{q}{r^6}\right)^{-1}, \quad \mu=1,\ldots ,3 \quad i=4,\ldots , 11,\end{align} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Minkowski space|flat-space]] metric and the distinction has been made between world volume &lt;math&gt;x^\mu&lt;/math&gt; and transverse &lt;math&gt;x^i&lt;/math&gt; coordinates. The constant &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is proportional to the [[Noether's theorem|charge]] of the brane which is given by the integral of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; over the boundary of the transverse space of the brane.&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0509137 A. Miemiec, I. Schnakenburg "Basics of M-theory"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MIKE BASIN''' is an extension of [[ArcMap]] ([[Environmental Systems Research Institute|ESRI]]) for integrated water resources management and planning. It provides a framework for managers and stakeholders to address multi-sectoral allocation and environmental issues in river basins. It is designed to investigate water sharing issues at international or interstate level, and between competing groups of water users, including the environment. MIKE BASIN is developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]]. As of September 2014, MIKE BASIN is no longer available for order or download from DHI. It has been replaced by the application named '''MIKE HYDRO Basin'''.

==Applications==
MIKE BASIN can be used for providing solutions and alternatives to water allocation and [[water shortage]] problems, improving and optimizing reservoir and hydropower operations, exploring conjunctive use of groundwater and surface water, evaluating and improving irrigation performance, solving multi-criteria optimization problems, establishing cost-effective measures for water quality compliance.

'''Made with Code''' is an initiative launched by [[Google]] on 19 July 2014. Google aimed to empower young women in middle and high schools with computer programming skills. Made with Code was created after Google’s own research found out that encouragement and exposure are the critical factors that would influence young females to pursue [[Computer Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women Who Choose Computer Science —  What Really Matters|url=http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.wenca.cn/en/us/edu/pdf/women-who-choose-what-really.pdf|website=Women Who Choose Computer Science —  What Really Matters|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424023623/http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/www.wenca.cn/en/us/edu/pdf/women-who-choose-what-really.pdf|archivedate=24 April 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that Google is funding $50 million to Made with Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Made with Code FAQ|url=https://www.madewithcode.com/faqs|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on top of the initial $40 million invested since 2010 in organizations like [[Code.org]], [[Black Girls Code]], and [[Girls Who Code]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title = Google Launches Made with Code –               News announcements – News from Google – Google|url = http://googlepress.blogspot.sg/2014/06/made-with-code-an-effort-by-google-to-inspire-girls-to-code.html|website = googlepress.blogspot.sg|accessdate = 2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Made with Code initiative involves both online activities as well as real life events, collaborating with notable firms like [[Shapeways]] and [[App Inventor]].

== Projects ==
Made with Code revolves primarily around providing online activities for young girls to learn coding on its website. Many of Made with Code’s projects use [[Blockly]] programming, a visual editor that writes programs by assembling individual blocks. Step by step instructions are provided to guide users. Along the way, works may either be discarded or saved and downloaded.

=== Dance Visualiser ===
Dance Visualiser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = THE DANCE VISUAL PROJECT: THE DANCE FLOOR IS YOUR CANVAS|url = https://www.madewithcode.com/project/dance|website = Made w/ Code|accessdate = 2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; mixes dance with code by modelling a visualiser that mirrors a dancer’s motions. Through the application of Blockly programming, users track the different parts such as the head, chest, hip and four limbs of the dancer’s body. After inputting the necessary details, a customized visualization is generated accordingly.

=== Music Mixer ===
In Music Mixer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.madewithcode.com/project/music|title=MUSIC MIXER: MAKE MUSIC YOU CAN SEE|website=Made w/ Code|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; users manipulate the number of notes and set the speed of each instrument to produce a colorful rotating visual music mixer. The range of instruments that are available include Acapella, Country, Electronic, HipHop, Pop and Rock.

=== Beats ===
Beats&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Beats Project_Made with Code|url = https://www.madewithcode.com/project/beats|website = Made w/ Code|accessdate = 2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; connects Blockly programming language and virtual instruments together to produce a string of beats. Users set the speed from a minimum of 30 to a maximum of 300 beats. The range of virtual instruments available include hi-hat, clave, cowbell, cymbal, tom, kick, snare and clap.

=== Avatar ===
Project Avata&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Avatar Project_Made with Code|url = https://www.madewithcode.com/project/avatar|website = Made w/ Code|accessdate = 2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; r allows users to customize their own avatar. Through Blockly programming language, users input different shapes on a virtual 2D work space, then arrange the shapes into a 3D avatar.

=== Accessorizer ===
Accessorizer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.madewithcode.com/project/accessorizer|title=Accessorizer Project_Made with Code|website=Made w/ Code|accessdate=2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow to [[wikt:accessorize|accessorize]] (put accessories on) a selfie with Blockly programming language. The first step is selecting an image, either by snapping a picture or selecting the available characters including Dorothy, Rose, Smoosh, Raul and Blanche. The next step is to position the accessories on top of the character or image. Accessories include the eyes, mouths, shirts, hats and wigs.

GIF&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Gif Project_Made with Code|url = https://www.madewithcode.com/project/gif|website = Made w/ Code|accessdate = 2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; lets users make a custom animation with a background and a series of frame. With the Blockly programming language, four images can be constructed which will then cycle so as to form an animation. The first step is to select the background, which includes characters such as Licky Ricky, Mayday Mary, Puss in Moon Boots, Purple Mess, Flappy the Uni-Horn, Tonsil Tammy, Bucky, Long Lidia, Permy and Mr. Hula Hips. The next step is to select frame(s), which includes various shapes and colors.

=== Kaleidoscope ===
Kaleidoscope&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = THE KALEIDOSCOPE PROJECT: CODE YOUR FACE INTO ART|url = https://www.madewithcode.com/project/art|website = Made w/ Code|accessdate = 2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; lets users manipulate the size, speed, and images of a kaleidoscope animation. After selecting an animation, either star, cross or flower, users pick an image and select a rotation speed. Next, select the image size by entering a percentage value.

=== Yeti ===
Yeti&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = THE YETI PROJECT: DANCE, SASQUATCH, DANCE|url = https://www.madewithcode.com/project/animation|website = Made w/ Code|accessdate = 2015-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; project allows users to create an animated Yeti with Blockly programming language. The first step is to drag and insert the YETI block onto the work space, followed by the character design block. Select the fur and skin color of your Yeti, as well as the hand and feet sizes. Next, select the animation command from the various range of actions provided.

=== Past notable projects ===

==== Code a Bracelet ====
Made with Code collaborated with [[Shapeways]] to allow girls to create their own customised bracelet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = SHAPEWAYS COLLABORATES WITH GOOGLE ON MADE WITH CODE INITIATIVE TO INSPIRE CREATIVITY THROUGH 3D PRINTING – Shapeways|url = http://www.shapeways.com/presscorner/press-release/6-19-2014-made-with-code|website = Shapeways.com|accessdate = 2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After designing the bracelet with [[Blockly]], Shapeways prints the bracelets using nylon plastic on their 3D EOS printers.

== Mentors and makers ==
Made with Code website features videos of mentors, who are females in different industries who have used computer coding in their career, and makers, who are young females who have made a difference in society using their coding skills. Some of the mentors and makers were also invited to hold talks such as during Made with Code's kick off event in New York City. Over 100 teenage girls from local organizations and public schools worked on coding projects and witnessed first-hand how women use code in their dream jobs.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

[[File:World Map 1689.JPG|250px|right|thumb|World map by Gerard van Shagen, [[Amsterdam]], 1689]]
[[File:Map of the world by the US Gov as of 2016.svg|250px|thumb|right|World map from 2016 ''[[CIA World Factbook]]'']]

A '''map''' is a [[symbol]]ic depiction emphasizing relationships between elements of some space, such as [[Physical body|objects]], [[region]]s, or themes.

Many maps are static, fixed to [[paper]] or some other durable medium, while others are dynamic or interactive. Although most commonly used to depict geography, maps may represent any [[space]], real or fictional, without regard to [[context (language use)|context]] or [[scale (map)|scale]], such as in [[brain mapping]], [[DNA]] mapping, or computer network topology mapping. The space being mapped may be two dimensional, such as the surface of the earth, three dimensional, such as the interior of the earth, or even more abstract spaces of any dimension, such as arise in modeling phenomena having many independent variables.

Although the earliest maps known are of the heavens, geographic maps of territory have a very long tradition and exist from ancient times. The word "map" comes from the medieval Latin ''Mappa mundi'', wherein ''mappa'' meant napkin or cloth and ''mundi'' the world. Thus, "map" became the shortened term referring to a two-dimensional representation of the surface of the world.

==Geographic maps==
[[File:Planisphæri cœleste.jpg|thumb|A celestial map from the 17th century, by the  cartographer [[Frederik de Wit]]]]

[[Cartography]] or ''map-making'' is the study and practice of crafting representations of the Earth upon a flat surface (see [[History of cartography]]), and one who makes maps is called a [[cartography|cartographer]].

[[Road atlas|Road maps]] are perhaps the most widely used maps today, and form a subset of navigational maps, which also include aeronautical and [[nautical chart]]s, railroad network maps, and hiking and bicycling maps. In terms of quantity, the largest number of drawn map sheets is probably made up by local surveys, carried out by [[municipality|municipalities]], utilities, tax assessors, emergency services providers, and other local agencies.  Many national surveying projects have been carried out by the military, such as the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ordnance Survey]]: a civilian government agency, internationally renowned for its comprehensively detailed work.

In addition to location information, maps may also be used to portray [[contour line]]s indicating constant values of [[elevation]], [[temperature]], [[rain]]fall, etc.

==Orientation of maps==
[[File:Hereford Mappa Mundi 1300.jpg|thumb|''The [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]]'' from about 1300, [[Hereford Cathedral]], England, is a classic "T-O" map with Jerusalem at centre, east toward the top, Europe the bottom left and Africa on the right.]]
The orientation of a map is the relationship between the directions on the map and the corresponding [[compass direction]]s in reality. The word "[[orient]]" is derived from [[Latin]] ''oriens'', meaning east. In the [[Middle Ages]] many maps, including the [[T and O map]]s, were drawn with east at the top (meaning that the direction "up" on the map corresponds to East on the compass). The most common cartographic convention is that north is at the top of a map.

Maps not oriented with north at the top:
* Maps from non-Western traditions are oriented a variety of ways. Old maps of [[Edo]] show the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Japanese imperial palace]] as the "top", but also at the centre, of the map. Labels on the map are oriented in such a way that you cannot read them properly unless you put the imperial palace above your head.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
* [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] European [[T and O map]]s such as the [[Hereford Mappa Mundi]] were centred on [[Jerusalem]] with East at the top. Indeed, prior to the reintroduction of [[Ptolemy]]'s ''[[Geographia|Geography]]'' to Europe around 1400, there was no single convention in the West. [[Portolan chart]]s, for example, are oriented to the shores they describe.
* Maps of cities bordering a sea are often conventionally oriented with the sea at the top.
* Route and channel maps have traditionally been oriented to the road or waterway they describe.
* [[Azimuthal equidistant projection|Polar maps]] of the [[Arctic]] or [[Antarctica|Antarctic]] regions are conventionally centred on the pole; the direction North would be towards or away from the centre of the map, respectively. Typical maps of the Arctic have 0° meridian towards the bottom of the page; maps of the Antarctic have the 0° meridian towards the top of the page.
* [[Reversed map]]s, also known as ''Upside-Down maps'' or ''South-Up maps'', reverse the ''North is up'' convention and have south at the top.
* [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s [[Dymaxion map]]s are based on a projection of the Earth's [[sphere]] onto an [[icosahedron]]. The resulting triangular pieces may be arranged in any order or orientation.
* Modern digital [[GIS]] maps such as [[ArcMap]] typically project north at the top of the map, but use math degrees (0 is east, degrees increase counter-clockwise), rather than compass degrees (0 is north, degrees increase clockwise) for orientation of transects. Compass decimal degrees can be converted to math degrees by subtracting them from 450; if the answer is greater than 360, subtract 360.

==Scale and accuracy==

[[File:Blank globe.svg|thumb|A 'global view map' of Europe, Western Asia and Africa.]]

Many maps are drawn to a [[Scale (map)|scale]] expressed as a [[ratio]], such as 1:10,000, which means that 1 unit of [[measurement]] on the map corresponds to 10,000 of that same unit on the ground. The scale statement can be accurate when the region mapped is small enough for the [[curvature]] of the Earth to be neglected, such as a [[city map]]. Mapping larger regions, where curvature cannot be ignored, requires [[map projection|projections]] to map from the curved surface of the Earth to the plane. The impossibility of flattening the [[sphere]] to the [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] without distortion means that the map cannot have constant scale. Rather, on most projections the best that can be attained is accurate scale along one or two paths on the projection. Because scale differs everywhere, it can only be measured meaningfully as [[scale (map)|point scale]] per location. Most maps strive to keep point scale variation within narrow bounds. Although the scale statement is nominal it is usually accurate enough for most purposes unless the map covers a large fraction of the earth. At the scope of a world map, scale as a single number is practically meaningless throughout most of the map. Instead, it usually refers to the scale along the equator.

Large scale maps, (e.g. 1:10,000), cover relatively small regions in great detail and small scale maps, (e.g. 1:10,000,000), cover large regions such as nations, continents and the whole [[globe]]. The large/small terminology arose from the practice of writing scales as numerical fractions: 1/10,000 is larger than 1/10,000,000. There is no exact dividing line between large and small but 1/100,000 might well be considered as a medium scale. Examples of large scale maps are the 1:25,000 maps produced for hikers; on the other hand maps intended for motorists at 1:250,000 or 1:1,000,000 are small scale.

It is important to recognize that even the most accurate maps sacrifice a certain amount of accuracy in scale to deliver a greater visual usefulness to its user. For example, the width of roads and small streams are exaggerated when they are too narrow to be shown on the map at true scale; that is, on a printed map they would be narrower than could be perceived by the naked eye. The same applies to computer maps where the smallest unit is the [[pixel]]. A narrow stream say must be shown to have the width of a pixel even if at the map scale it would be a small fraction of the pixel width.
[[File:EU Pop2008 1024.PNG|thumb|Cartogram: The [[European Union|EU]] distorted to show population distributions.]]

Some maps, called [[cartogram]]s, have the scale deliberately distorted to reflect information other than land area or distance. For example, this map (at the right) of [[Europe]] has been distorted to show population distribution, while the rough shape of the continent is still discernible.

Another example of distorted scale is the famous [[Tube map|London Underground map]]. The basic geographical structure is respected but the tube lines (and the [[River Thames]]) are smoothed to clarify the relationships between stations. Near the center of the map stations are spaced out more than near the edges of map.

Further inaccuracies may be deliberate. For example, cartographers may simply omit military installations or remove features solely in order to enhance the clarity of the map. For example, a road map may not show railroads, smaller waterways or other prominent non-road objects, and even if it does, it may show them less clearly (e.g. dashed or dotted lines/outlines) than the main roads. Known as decluttering, the practice makes the subject matter that the user is interested in easier to read, usually without sacrificing overall accuracy. Software-based maps often allow the user to toggle decluttering between ON, OFF and AUTO as needed. In AUTO the degree of decluttering is adjusted as the user changes the scale being displayed.

==Map types and projections==

{{Category see also|Map types}}
[[File:Ocean gravity map.gif|thumb|Map of large underwater features. (1995, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]])]]
Maps of the world or large areas are often either 'political' or 'physical'. The most important purpose of the political map is to show territorial [[border]]s; the purpose of the physical is to show features of [[geography]] such as mountains, soil type or land use including infrastructure such as roads, railroads and buildings. [[Topographic map]]s show [[elevation]]s and [[Terrain|relief]] with [[contour line]]s or shading. [[Geological map]]s show not only the physical surface, but characteristics of the underlying rock, [[fault (geology)|fault]] lines, and subsurface structures.
Maps that depict the surface of the Earth also use a [[map projection|projection]], a way of translating the three-dimensional real surface of the [[geoid]] to a two-dimensional picture. Perhaps the best-known world-map projection is the [[Mercator projection]], originally designed as a form of [[nautical chart]].
Aeroplane pilots use [[aeronautical chart]]s based on a [[Lambert conformal conic projection]], in which a cone is laid over the section of the earth to be mapped. The cone intersects the sphere (the earth) at one or two parallels which are chosen as standard lines. This allows the pilots to plot a great-circle route approximation on a flat, two-dimensional chart.
* [[Map projection#Azimuthal (projections onto a plane)|Azimuthal]] or [[Gnomonic projection|Gnomonic]] [[map projection]]s are often used in planning air routes due to their ability to represent [[great circle]]s as straight lines.
*  Richard Edes Harrison produced a striking series of maps during and after [[World War II]] for [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune magazine]]. These used "bird's eye" projections to emphasise globally strategic "fronts" in the air age, pointing out proximities and barriers not apparent on a conventional  rectangular projection of the world.

From the last quarter of the 20th century, the indispensable tool of the [[cartographer]] has been the computer. Much of cartography, especially at the data-gathering [[surveying|survey]] level, has been subsumed by [[geographic information system|Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS). The functionality of maps has been greatly advanced by technology simplifying the superimposition of spatially located variables onto existing geographical maps. Having local information such as rainfall level, distribution of wildlife, or demographic data integrated within the map allows more efficient analysis and better decision making. In the pre-electronic age such [[superimposition]] of data led [[John Snow (physician)|Dr. John Snow]] to identify the location of an outbreak of [[cholera]]. Today, it is used by agencies of the human kind, as diverse as wildlife conservationists and militaries around the world.

Even when GIS is not involved, most cartographers now use a variety of computer graphics programs to generate new maps.

Interactive, computerised maps are commercially available, allowing users to ''zoom in'' or ''zoom out'' (respectively meaning to increase or decrease the scale), sometimes by replacing one map with another of different scale, centered where possible on the same point.  In-car [[global navigation satellite system]]s are computerised maps with route-planning and advice facilities which monitor the user's position with the help of satellites. From the computer scientist's point of view, zooming in entails one or a combination of:

# replacing the map by a more detailed one
# enlarging the same map without enlarging the [[pixel]]s, hence showing more detail by removing less information compared to the less detailed version
# enlarging the same map with the pixels enlarged (replaced by rectangles of pixels); no additional detail is shown, but, depending on the quality of one's vision, possibly more detail can be seen; if a computer display does not show adjacent pixels really separate, but overlapping instead (this does not apply for an [[Liquid crystal display|LCD]], but may apply for a [[cathode ray tube]]), then replacing a pixel by a rectangle of pixels does show more detail.  A variation of this method is [[interpolation]].

[[File:World.pdf|thumb|A world map in PDF format.]]

For example:
* Typically (2) applies to a [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF) file or other format based on [[vector graphics]]. The increase in detail is limited to the information contained in the file: enlargement of a curve may eventually result in a series of standard geometric figures such as straight lines, arcs of circles or [[spline (mathematics)|splines]].
* (2) may apply to text and (3) to the outline of a map feature such as a forest or building.
* (1) may apply to the text as needed (displaying labels for more features), while (2) applies to the rest of the image.  Text is not necessarily enlarged when zooming in. Similarly, a road represented by a double line may or may not become wider when one zooms in.
* The map may also have layers which are partly [[raster graphics]] and partly [[vector graphics]].  For a single raster graphics image (2) applies until the pixels in the image file correspond to the pixels of the display, thereafter (3) applies.

== Climatic maps ==

The maps that reflect the territorial distribution of climatic conditions based on the results of long-term observations are called climatic maps. These maps can be compiled both for individual climatic features (temperature, precipitation, humidity) and for combinations of them at the earth's surface and in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Climatic maps afford a very convenient overview of the climatic features in a large region and permit values of climatic features to be compared in different parts of the region. Through interpolation the maps can be used to determine the values of climatic features in any particular spot.

Climatic maps generally apply to individual months and to the year as a whole, sometimes to the four seasons, to the growing period, and so forth. On maps compiled from the observations of ground meteorological stations, atmospheric pressure is converted to sea level. Air temperature maps are compiled both from the actual values observed on the surface of the earth and from values converted to sea level. The pressure field in free atmosphere is represented either by maps of the distribution of pressure at different standard altitudes—for example, at every kilometer above sea level—or by maps of baric topography on which altitudes (more precisely geopotentials) of the main isobaric surfaces (for example, 900, 800, and 700 millibars) counted off from sea level are plotted. The temperature, humidity, and wind on aeroclimatic maps may apply either to standard altitudes or to the main isobaric surfaces.

Isolines are drawn on maps of such climatic features as the long-term mean values (of atmospheric pressure, temperature, humidity, total precipitation, and so forth) to connect points with equal values of the feature in question—for example, isobars for pressure, isotherms for temperature, and isohyets for precipitation. Isoamplitudes are drawn on maps of amplitudes (for example, annual amplitudes of air temperature—that is, the differences between the mean temperatures of the warmest and coldest month). Isanomals are drawn on maps of anomalies (for example, deviations of the mean temperature of each place from the mean temperature of the entire latitudinal zone). Isolines of frequency are drawn on maps showing the frequency of a particular phenomenon (for example, annual number of days with a thunderstorm or snow cover). Isochrones are drawn on maps showing the dates of onset of a given phenomenon (for example, the first frost and appearance or disappearance of the snow cover) or the date of a particular value of a meteorological element in the course of a year (for example, passing of the mean daily air temperature through zero). Isolines of the mean numerical value of wind velocity or isotachs are drawn on wind maps (charts); the wind resultants and directions of prevailing winds are indicated by arrows of different length or arrows with different plumes; lines of flow are often drawn. Maps of the zonal and meridional components of wind are frequently compiled for the free atmosphere. Atmospheric pressure and wind are usually combined on climatic maps. Wind roses, curves showing the distribution of other meteorological elements, diagrams of the annual course of elements at individual stations, and the like are also plotted on climatic maps.

Maps of climatic regionalization, that is, division of the earth's surface into climatic zones and regions according to some classification of climates, are a special kind of climatic map.

Climatic maps are often incorporated into climatic atlases of varying geographic range (globe, hemispheres, continents, countries, oceans) or included in comprehensive atlases. Besides general climatic maps, applied climatic maps and atlases have great practical value. Aeroclimatic maps, aeroclimatic atlases, and agroclimatic maps are the most numerous.

==Conventional signs==
The various features shown on a map are represented by conventional [[sign]]s or symbols.  For example, colors can be used to indicate a classification of roads.  Those signs are usually explained in the margin of the map, or on a separately published characteristic sheet.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey, [https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf Explorer Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403185303/https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/docs/legends/25k-raster-legend.pdf |date=3 April 2016 }}; Swisstopo, [http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf Conventional Signs]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528053109/http://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/internet/swisstopo/en/home/products/maps/leisure/hiking.parsysrelated1.96279.downloadList.81398.DownloadFile.tmp/symbolsen.pdf |date=28 May 2008 }}; United States Geological Survey, [http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ Topographic Map Symbols] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601185821/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/symbols/ |date=1 June 2008 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cartographers prefer to make the map cover practically the entire screen or sheet of paper, leaving no room "outside" the map for information about the map as a whole.
These cartographers typically place such information in an otherwise "blank" region "inside" the map{{mdash}}[[cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]], [[legend (map)|map legend]], title, [[compass rose]], [[bar scale]], etc.
In particular, some maps contain smaller "sub-maps"&lt;!-- is there a better term? --&gt; in otherwise blank regions—often one at a much smaller scale showing the whole globe and where the whole map fits on that globe, and a few showing "regions of interest" at a larger scale in order to show details that wouldn't otherwise fit.
Occasionally sub-maps use the same scale as the large map—a few maps of the [[contiguous United States]] include a sub-map&lt;!-- is there a better term? --&gt; to the same scale for each of the two non-contiguous states.

===Labeling===
To communicate spatial information effectively, features such as rivers, lakes, and cities need to be [[Labeling (map design)|labeled]]. Over centuries cartographers have developed the art of placing names on even the densest of maps. Text placement or name placement can get mathematically very complex as the number of labels and map density increases. Therefore, text placement is time-consuming and labor-intensive, so cartographers and GIS users have developed [[automatic label placement]] to ease this process.&lt;ref&gt;Imhof, E., “Die Anordnung der Namen in der Karte,” Annuaire International de Cartographie II, Orell-Füssli Verlag, Zürich, 93–129, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, H., Map data processing and the annotation problem, Proc. 3rd Scandinavian Conf. on Image Analysis, Chartwell-Bratt Ltd. Copenhagen, 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-geographical spatial maps==
Maps exist of the [[Solar System]], and other cosmological features such as [[star map]]s. In addition maps of other bodies such as the Moon and other planets are technically not ''[[geospatial|geo]]''graphical maps.

==Topological maps==
[[File:Inventory Locations Represented as a Map.png|thumb|upright=1.3|In a [[topological map]], like this one showing inventory locations, the distances between locations is not important. Only the layout and connectivity between them matters.]]
Diagrams such as [[schematic diagram]]s and [[Gantt chart]]s and [[treemap]]s display logical relationships between items, rather than geographical relationships. [[Topological]] in nature, only the connectivity is significant. The [[London Underground map]] and similar subway maps around the world are a common example of these maps.

==General-purpose maps==
General-purpose maps provide many types of information on one map. Most atlas maps, wall maps, and road maps fall into this category. The following are some features that might be shown on general-purpose maps: bodies of water, roads, railway lines, parks, elevations, towns and cities, political boundaries, latitude and longitude, national and provincial parks. These maps give a broad understanding of location and features of an area.  The reader may gain an understanding of the type of landscape, the location of urban places, and the location of major transportation routes all at once.

==Legal regulation==

Some countries required that all published maps represent their national claims regarding [[border dispute]]s.  For example:
* Within Russia, Google Maps shows [[Crimea]] as part of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2014/04/12/302337754/google-maps-displays-crimean-border-differently-in-russia-u-s |title=Google Maps Displays Crimean Border Differently In Russia, U.S. |date=12 April 2014 |work=[[NPR.org]] |first=Bill |last=Chappell |author-link=Bill Chappell |access-date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Both the Republic of India and the People's Republic of China require that all maps show areas subject to the [[Sino-Indian border dispute]] in their own favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/03/23/us-google-asia-idUSBRE82M0I020120323 |title=Google charts a careful course through Asia's maps |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |first=Jeremy |last=Wagstaff |author-link=Jeremy Wagstaff |access-date=6 September 2018 |date=23 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the People's Republic of China began requiring that all online maps served from within China be hosted there, making them subject to Chinese laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Guanqun |first=Wang |title=China issues new rules on Internet map publishing |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-05/19/c_13302696.htm |work=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |access-date=27 July 2016 |date=19 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527193512/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-05/19/c_13302696.htm |archive-date=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}
'''Medieval stained glass''' is the coloured and painted glass of [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] from the 10th century to the 16th century. For much of this period [[stained glass]] windows were the major pictorial art form, particularly in [[France in the Middle Ages|northern France]], [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]] and [[England in the Middle Ages|England]], where windows tended to be larger than in southern Europe (in [[Italy]], for example, [[fresco]]s were more common).

Stained glass windows were used predominantly in churches, but were also found in wealthy domestic settings and public buildings such as town halls, though surviving examples of secular glass are very rare indeed.  The purpose of stained glass windows in a church was both to enhance the beauty of their setting and to inform the viewer through narrative or symbolism. The subject matter was generally religious in churches, though "portraits" and [[heraldry]] are often included, and many narrative scenes give valuable insights into the medieval world.

==History ==
[[File:Süddeutscher Glasmaler 001.jpg|thumb|upright|The prophet Daniel from Augsburg Cathedral (c. 1065)]]

=== Early stained glass ===
Window glass was in use from at least the 1st century AD and colored and painted window glass for use in religious buildings was also manufactured at an early date. The earliest extant example of ecclesiastical stained glass is possibly that from San Vitale in Ravenna, Italy. A clear glass roundel with a depiction of Christ in Majesty, thought to be the 6th century, was discovered here.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975, 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest known examples of colored window glass, datable to c. 800–820, were recovered in excavations at the Abbey of San Vicenzo in Volturno, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 109&lt;/ref&gt; Glass of the same colour ranges and similar date is also found in England, at the monastic sites of [[Monkwearmouth–Jarrow Abbey|Jarrow and Monkwearmouth]], and at other sites in the north of England.&lt;ref&gt;Cramp 1975, 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson 1992, 175&lt;/ref&gt; These examples are not painted. However, it was not until the advent of the monumental cathedral and church building campaigns in the 11th and 12th centuries that the demand for colored glass began to increase significantly, reaching its highest level in the 14th and 15th centuries. The oldest surviving stained glass windows still ''in situ'' are thought to be the Prophet Windows in [[Augsburg Cathedral]], of c. 1065.

A useful 12th-century source on medieval glass manufacture is the ''De Divers Artibus'' of [[Theophilus Presbyter]]. Theophilus was a Benedictine Monk, believed by some scholars to be [[Roger of Helmarshausen]], a metal glass and pigment worker who practiced in the late 11th and early 12th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley et al 1998, 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 739&lt;/ref&gt; ''De Divers Artibus'' describes a number of craft processes including glassmaking and glassworking.

In the 9th century, CE or earlier (books 1 and 2 of a 3-vol Mss. completed by another in the 12th, Eraclius, in ''De coloribus et artibus Romanorum'', also gives an account of methods for producing colored glass, although he may have copied much of his text from the ''Naturalis Historia'' of [[Pliny the Elder]] of c. 77AD.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Encyclopedia of the arts, separately CS Smith and JG Hawthorne, translation of the Mappe Clavicula – introduction p4, Transactions of the American Phil. Soc., VOL 64 PT.4 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Now considered 'Inaccurate' date on works of Eraclius&lt;ref&gt;Heyworth 1992, 169&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the medieval period  the son of Anthony of Pisa, artist and instructor [[Cennino Cennini]], and, in 1556, Georgius Agricola&lt;ref&gt;1st ed De Re Metallica, as translated by (President) Herbert C. and (1st Lady) Lou Henry Hoover, The Mining Magazine, London, 1912, reprinted 1950 by the Dover Press, NY&lt;/ref&gt; also contributed texts with aspects of glassmaking and glassworking.

==Composition, manufacture and distribution ==

Prior to c. 1000, most coloured glass was of a soda-lime-silica composition. In Northern Europe soda glass was eventually almost totally superseded by potash-lime-silica glass ([[Forest glass]]). Forest glass continued to be used in stained glass for the duration of the medieval period&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 739&lt;/ref&gt; until soda glass again began to be used in the 16th century.

The potash (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) found in [[Forest Glass]] was derived from wood ash. In ''De Divers Artibus'', Theophilus describes the use of beech wood as the preferred source of ash.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne ''et al'' (eds.) 1979, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Other plant matter, such as bracken, was also used.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 57&lt;/ref&gt; As well as containing potash, beech ash comprises an assortment of compounds including iron and manganese oxides, which are particularly important for generating colour in glass.

Medieval stained glass panels could be created either by the [[cylinder blown sheet]] or [[crown glass (window)]] method.

Forest glass was manufactured in Burgundy and Lorraine near the Rhein; in Flanders; and in Normandy, in the Seine and Loire Valleys. It was distributed throughout mainland north-west Europe and Britain in the form of ready-made sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 266&lt;/ref&gt; The application of painted decoration to and final shaping of the sheets was carried out at glass working centres close by the final destination of the glass.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colour===
{{main|Glass colour}}
The colour of glass could be affected by many factors. Sources of silica were often impure, with [[iron oxide]] being one of the most common impurities. The greenish hue of uncoloured glass is usually owing to the presence of a mixture of ferrous (Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and ferric (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions in the glass matrix. It is also possible that ‘impurities’ could be introduced at the fritting stage within the glass furnace, leading to the addition of further alumina, [[silica]] and iron oxides.&lt;ref&gt;Smedley et al 1998, 156&lt;/ref&gt;

====Inherent colour====

Inherent colour refers to the colours that may be formed in the molten glass by manipulating the furnace environment. Theophilus describes molten glass changing to a ‘saffron yellow colour’ which will eventually transform to a reddish yellow on further heating, he also refers to a ‘tawny colour, like flesh’ which, upon further heating will become ‘a light purple’ and later ‘a reddish purple, and exquisite’.&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne et al (eds.) 1979, 55&lt;/ref&gt;

These colour changes are the result of the behaviour, under redox conditions, of the iron and [[manganese oxide]]s which are naturally present in beech wood ash.

In the glass melt the iron and manganese behave as follows:

In an oxidising environment metal (and some non-metal) ions will lose electrons. In iron oxides, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (ferrous) ions will become Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (ferric) ions. In molten glass this will result in a change in glass colour from pale blue to yellow/brown. In a reducing environment the iron will gain electrons and colour will change from yellow/brown to pale blue. Similarly manganese will change in colour depending on its oxidation state. The lower oxidation state of manganese (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) is yellow in common glass while the higher oxidation states (Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; or higher) is purple. A combination of the two states will give a pink glass.

As the manganese and iron may each be in different states of oxidation, the combination of the two can result in a broad range of attractive colours. Manganese in its fully oxidised state, if not present in too great a mass, will also act as a decolourant of glass if the iron is in its yellow, ferric form. The two colours in effect cancel each other out to produce a clear glass.

Experimental manufacture of potash glass emulating Theophilus’ recipes has resulted in colours ranging from colourless to yellow, amber, brown, green, blue, pink and purple.&lt;ref&gt;Stern et al 2004, 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newton 1978, 59&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Variation in colour hue and depth would also probably be affected by the source of the beech wood ash, depending on the soil chemistry where the beech tree grew, the age of the tree and the climate conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Royce-Roll 1994, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern et al 2004, 143&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Some of the stronger reds, blues and greens that are a feature of medieval stained glass rely on the addition of [[Copper oxide (disambiguation)|copper oxide]]s&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;.

====Deliberately added colourants====

[[File:Vitrail Chartres 210209 07.jpg|thumb|Detail of a panel from [[Chartres Cathedral]]]]
[[File:England YorkMinster JesseTree c1170.JPG|thumb|Detail of the Jesse Tree panel from [[York Minster]]]]

Eraclius’ ''De Coloribus et Artibus'' includes instructions for creating green and red glass by adding copper (probably in the form of ore or copper filings) to the batch, a method practiced since ancient times.  (The chapters on how to make red, green and blue glass are missing from ''De Divers Artibus''.)
As with the iron/manganese colours, the colours formed by the addition of copper oxide to the glass are dependent on the different oxidation states of the added copper. In an oxidising environment blue cupric (Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions are formed, in a strongly reducing environment red colloidal cuprous (Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) oxide is formed and if reoxidised then green cuprous (Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;) oxide results.

The production of bright reds and blues in particular was straightforward, as the addition of copper to the mix resulted in the reliable creation of red, blue and green. The dominance of red and blue in Romanesque and Gothic glass is obvious. However, at York Minster, for example, it was demonstrated that 90% of the medieval glass was coloured by means of iron/manganese content.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 740&lt;/ref&gt;

Early medieval glass was soda-based, and although the use of soda glass in Northern Europe was almost wholly superseded by [[forest glass]] after c. 1000, there are some examples of a richly coloured blue glass (identified through [[X-ray fluorescence|XRF]] analysis) that was produced in the medieval period using soda as the alkali.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, a considerable quantity of blue soda glass has been identified in stained glass from York Minster, and in excavations at Old Sarum and Winchester. In France, in Chartres Cathedral and St Denis in Paris, soda glass has also been found,&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 58&lt;/ref&gt; and no doubt there must be many other examples.

Evidence of recycling [[Roman glass|Roman]] [[Mosaic|tesserae]] to produce window glass in the 9th century has been identified at the Benedictine Monastery of San Vincenzo, Molise, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Freestone 1992, 743&lt;/ref&gt; Theophilus, in the 12th century, was also aware of such practice. He states that mosaic tesserae: ‘little square stones’ from ‘ancient pagan buildings’ along with ‘various small vessels in the same colours’ could be used to produce glass: ‘they even melt the blue in their furnaces, adding a little of the clear white to it, and they make from it blue glass sheets which are costly and very useful in windows.’&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne et al (eds.) 1979, 59&lt;/ref&gt; According to Theophilus, the French were particularly skilled at this process.

Cox suggests that the examples analysed at York could indeed be ‘Roman, or slightly later, glass re-melted in France and imported into England’.&lt;ref&gt;Cox et al 1986, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flashing====
Glass comprising multiple layers of clear and (usually) red glass was known to exist in the 12th and 13th centuries. The manufacturing process is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Flashing was developed in the 15th century, and refers to the superimposition of a thin layer of coloured glass onto another coloured or uncoloured glass sheet. The procedure may have involved dipping a small sphere of molten glass into a molten uncoloured glass and blowing this into a cylinder form (the [[cylinder blown sheet]] process) which was then cut into sections and flattened in an annealing oven.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Red, or ruby, copper-based glass, is usually flashed as the colour is too dense to be used alone. Other glass colours may also be flashed. These techniques could be remarkably sophisticated as demonstrated by 15thc. glass from the Carthusian Monastery of Pavia, where layered glasses of blue and violet; green and uncoloured; and red and uncoloured have been identified.&lt;ref&gt;Azzoni et al 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Applied paint and silver stain===
[[Image:silver stain.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail showing use of applied paint and silver stain.]]

====Paint====
The paint applied to glass was a type of enamel, usually dark brown or black, formed from a mixture of: ground copper or iron oxide; powdered glass; wine, urine or vinegar; and gum arabic.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 2001, 273&lt;/ref&gt; other recipes could include sugar, treacle or vegetable oil.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 132&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘paint’ was applied in a series of washes, with fine details added last. Both the external and internal faces of the glass could be painted, adding depth to the overall composition. The enamel was fixed by ‘firing’ the glass in an annealing oven.

====Silver stain====
Producing a strong clear yellow could be difficult in early stained glass as it relied upon the careful control of furnace conditions in order to create the appropriate reducing or oxidising environment.&lt;ref&gt;Royce-Roll 1994, 74&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of silver stain in the early 14th century not only provided a solution to this difficulty, but also allowed greater flexibility in the way in which colour could be used. The first datable example of the use of silver stain is in the parish church of Le Mesnil-Villeman, Manche, France (1313).&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 38&lt;/ref&gt; Silver stain was a combination of [[silver nitrate]] or [[silver sulphide]] blended with pipe clay and applied to (usually) clear glass.&lt;ref&gt;Davison 2003, 133&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique enabled a more flexible approach to glass painting, allowing, for example, the hair of a figure to be painted on the same piece of glass as the head. It was also used to highlight details of canopywork or grisaille, and later it was added to the surface of coloured glass, to create a wider variety of glass hues.&lt;ref&gt;Marks 1993, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27254">In [[music]], a '''note''' is the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Duration (music)|duration]] of a sound, and also its representation in [[musical notation]] (♪, ♩). A note can also represent a [[pitch class]]. Notes are the building blocks of much written music: [[musical analysis#Discretization|discretizations]] of musical phenomena that facilitate performance, comprehension, and [[musical analysis|analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Nattiez 1990, p.81n9&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''note'' can be used in both generic and specific senses: one might say either "the piece '[[Happy Birthday to You]]' begins with two notes having the same pitch", or "the piece begins with two repetitions of the same note". In the former case, one uses ''note'' to refer to a specific musical event; in the latter, one uses the term to refer to a class of events sharing the same pitch. (See also: [[Key signature names and translations]].)

[[File:Treble a.svg|right|250px|thumb|The note ''A'' or ''La'']]
[[File:Cifrado americano.JPG|right|thumb|Names of some notes without accidentals]]

Two notes with [[fundamental frequency|fundamental frequencies]] in a ratio equal to any integer power of two (e.g., half, twice, or four times) are perceived as very similar. Because of that, all notes with these kinds of relations can be grouped under the same [[pitch class]].

In traditional music theory, most countries in the world use the [[solfège]] naming convention Do–Re–Mi–Fa–Sol–La–Si, including for instance Italy, Portugal, Spain, France, Poland, Romania, most Latin American countries, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Russia, and all the Arabic-speaking or Persian-speaking countries. However, within the English-speaking and Dutch-speaking world, pitch classes are typically represented by the first seven letters of the Latin alphabet (A, B, C, D, E, F and G). A few European countries, including Germany, adopt an almost identical notation, in which H substitutes for B (see below for details). In Indian music the [[Sanskrit]] names Sa–Re–Ga–Ma–Pa–Dha–Ni (स–रे–ग–म–प–ध–नि) is used, as in Telugu Sa–Ri–Ga–Ma–Pa–Da–Ni (స–రి–గ–మ–ప–ద–ని), and in Tamil (ச–ரி–க–ம–ப–த–நி). Byzantium used the names Pa–Vu–Ga–Di–Ke–Zo–Ni. 

The eighth note, or [[octave]], is given the same name as the first, but has double its frequency. The name octave is also used to indicate the span between a note and another with double frequency. To differentiate two notes that have the same pitch class but fall into different octaves, the system of [[scientific pitch notation]] combines a letter name with an Arabic numeral designating a specific octave. For example, the now-standard tuning pitch for most Western music, 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, is named a′ or A4.

There are two formal systems to define each note and octave, the [[Helmholtz pitch notation]] and the [[scientific pitch notation]].

== Accidentals ==

Letter names are modified by the [[accidental (music)|accidentals]]. The [[sharp (music)|sharp sign]] {{music|sharp}} raises a note by a [[semitone]] or half-step, and a [[flat (music)|flat]] {{music|flat}} lowers it by the same amount. In [[Equal temperament|modern tuning]] a [[half step]] has a frequency ratio of [[Twelfth root of two|{{radic|2|12}}]], approximately 1.059. The accidentals are written after the note name: so, for example, F{{music|sharp}} represents F-sharp, B{{music|flat}} is B-flat, and C{{music|natural}} is C natural (or C).
[[File:frequency vs name.svg|frame|right|Frequency vs position on [[treble clef]]. Each note shown has a frequency of the previous note multiplied by {{radic|2|12}}]]

Additional accidentals are the double-sharp {{music|##}}, raising the frequency by two semitones, and double-flat {{music|bb}}, lowering it by that amount.

In musical notation, accidentals are placed before the note symbols. Systematic alterations to the seven lettered pitches in the scale can be indicated by placing the symbols in the [[key signature]], which then apply implicitly to all occurrences of corresponding notes. Explicitly noted accidentals can be used to override this effect for the remainder of a bar. A special accidental, the [[natural (music)|natural]] symbol {{music|natural}}, is used to indicate an unmodified pitch. Effects of key signature and local accidentals do not accumulate. If the key signature indicates G{{music|sharp}}, a local flat before a G makes it G{{music|flat}} (not G{{music|natural}}), though often this type of rare accidental is expressed as a natural, followed by a flat ({{music|natural}}{{music|b}}) to make this clear. Likewise (and more commonly), a double sharp {{music|##}} sign on a key signature with a single sharp {{music|#}} indicates only a double sharp, not a triple sharp.

Assuming [[enharmonic]]ity, many accidentals will create equivalences between pitches that are written differently. For instance, raising the note B to B{{music|sharp}} is equal to the note C. Assuming all such equivalences, the complete [[chromatic scale]] adds five additional pitch classes to the original seven lettered notes for a total of 12 (the 13th note completing the [[octave]]), each separated by a half-step.

Notes that belong to the [[diatonic scale]] relevant in the context are sometimes called ''[[diatonic]] notes''; notes that do not meet that criterion are then sometimes called ''[[chromatic]] notes''.

Another style of notation, rarely used in English, uses the suffix "is" to indicate a sharp and "es" (only "s" after A and E) for a flat, e.g., Fis for F{{music|sharp}}, Ges for G{{music|flat}}, Es for E{{music|flat}}. This system first arose in Germany and is used in almost all European countries whose main language is not English, Greek, or a Romance language.

In most countries using these suffixes, the letter H is used to represent what is B natural in English, the letter B is used instead of B{{music|flat}}, and Heses (i.e., H{{music|bb}}) is used instead of B{{music|bb}} (although Bes and Heses both denote the English B{{music|bb}}). Dutch-speakers in Belgium and the Netherlands use the same suffixes, but applied throughout to the notes A to G, so that B, B{{music|flat}} and B{{music|bb}} have the same meaning as in English, although they are called B, Bes, and Beses instead of B, B flat and B double flat. Denmark also uses H, but uses Bes instead of Heses for B{{music|bb}}.

==12-tone chromatic scale==

The following chart lists the names used in different countries for the 12 notes of a [[chromatic scale]] built on C. The corresponding symbols are shown within parenthesis. Differences between German and English notation are highlighted in '''bold''' typeface. Although the English and Dutch names are different, the corresponding symbols are identical.

== Note designation in accordance with octave name ==
{{See also|Piano key frequencies}}
The table below shows each octave and the frequencies for every note of pitch class A. The traditional ([[Helmholtz pitch notation|Helmholtz]]) system centers on the great octave (with capital letters) and small octave (with lower case letters). Lower octaves are named "contra" (with primes before), higher ones "lined" (with primes after). Another system ([[Scientific pitch notation|scientific]]) suffixes a number (starting with 0, or sometimes −1). In this system A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is nowadays standardised at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, lying in the octave containing notes from C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (middle C) to B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The lowest note on most pianos is A&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the highest C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;. The [[MIDI]] system for electronic musical instruments and computers uses a straight count starting with note 0 for C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; at 8.1758&amp;nbsp;Hz up to note 127 for G&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; at 12,544&amp;nbsp;Hz.

== Written notes ==
A written note can also have a [[note value]], a code that determines the note's relative [[Duration (music)|duration]]. In order of halving duration, they are: [[double whole note|double note (breve)]]; [[whole note|whole note (semibreve)]]; [[half note|half note (minim)]]; [[quarter note|quarter note (crotchet)]]; [[eighth note|eighth note (quaver)]]; [[sixteenth note|sixteenth note (semiquaver)]].; [[thirty-second note|thirty-second note (demisemiquaver)]], [[sixty-fourth note|sixty-fourth note (hemidemisemiquaver)]], and [[hundred twenty-eighth note]].
&lt;!--PLEASE DON'T ADD THE NAME "QUASIHEMIDEMISEMIQUAVER" OR "SEMIHEMIDEMISEMIQUAVER" WITHOUT A REPUTABLE PEER REVIEWED SOURCE FOR IT, SUCH AS THE OXFORD DICTIONARY OF MUSIC OR A REPUTABLE UNABRIDGED DICTIONARY--&gt;

In a [[Sheet music|score]], each note is assigned a specific vertical position on a [[staff position]] (a line or space) on the [[Musical staff|staff]], as determined by the [[clef]]. Each line or space is assigned a note name. These names are memorized by [[musician]]s and allow them to know at a glance the proper pitch to play on their instruments.

&lt;/center&gt;

The [[Staff (music)|staff]] above shows the notes C, D, E, F, G, A, B, C and then in reverse order, with no key signature or accidentals.

== Note frequency (hertz) ==
{{Main|Music and mathematics}}
In all technicality, ''music'' can be composed of notes at any arbitrary physical{{clarify|date=November 2012}} [[frequency]]. Since the physical causes of music are vibrations of mechanical systems, they are often measured in [[hertz]] (Hz), with 1&amp;nbsp;Hz meaning one vibration per second. For historical and other reasons, especially in Western music, only twelve notes of fixed frequencies are used. These fixed frequencies are mathematically related to each other, and are defined around the central note, A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The current "standard pitch" or modern "[[concert pitch]]" for this note is 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, although this varies in actual practice (see [[Concert pitch#History of pitch standards in Western music|History of pitch standards]]).

The note-naming convention specifies a letter, any [[accidental (music)|accidentals]], and an octave number. Each note is an [[integer]] number of half-steps away from concert A (A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Let this distance be denoted ''n''. If the note is above A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''n'' is [[positive number|positive]]; if it is below A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''n'' is [[negative number|negative]]. The frequency of the note (''f'') (assuming [[equal temperament]]) is then:
:&lt;math&gt;f = 2^\frac{n}{12} \times 440 \text{ Hz}\,&lt;/math&gt;

For example, one can find the frequency of C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, the first C above A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. There are 3 half-steps between A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → A{{music|sharp}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;), and the note is above A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, so ''n'' = 3. The note's frequency is:

:&lt;math&gt;f = 2^\frac{3}{12} \times 440 \text{ Hz} \approx 523.2 \text{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

To find the frequency of a note below A4, the value of ''n'' is negative. For example, the F below A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. There are 4 half-steps (A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → A{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → G{{music|flat}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and the note is below A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, so ''n'' = −4. The note's frequency is:

:&lt;math&gt;f = 2^{-\frac{4}{12}} \times 440 \text{ Hz} \approx 349.2 \text{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, it can be seen from this formula that octaves automatically yield [[exponentiation|powers]] of two times the original frequency, since ''n'' is a multiple of 12 (12''k'', where ''k'' is the number of octaves up or down), and so the formula reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt;f = 2^\frac{12k}{12} \times 440 \text{ Hz} = 2^k \times 440 \text{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

yielding a [[factorization|factor]] of 2. In fact, this is the means by which this formula is derived, combined with the notion of equally-spaced [[interval (music)|intervals]].

The distance of an equally [[Musical temperament|tempered]] semitone is divided into 100 [[cent (music)|cents]]. So 1200 cents are equal to one octave – a frequency ratio of 2:1. This means that a cent is precisely equal to {{radic|2|1200}}, which is approximately {{val|1.000578}}.

For use with the [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface|MIDI]] (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) standard, a frequency mapping is defined by:

:&lt;math&gt;p = 69 + 12 \times \log_2\frac{f}{440 \text{ Hz}}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'' is the MIDI note number (and 69 is the number of semitones between C&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; (note 0) and A&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). And in the opposite direction, to obtain the frequency from a MIDI note ''p'', the formula is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;f=2^\frac{p-69}{12} \times 440 \text{ Hz}&lt;/math&gt;

For notes in an A440 equal temperament, this formula delivers the standard MIDI note number (''p''). Any other frequencies fill the space between the whole numbers evenly. This lets MIDI instruments be tuned accurately in any microtuning scale, including non-western traditional tunings.

== History of note names ==
Music notation systems have used letters of the [[alphabet]] for centuries. The 6th-century philosopher [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]] is known to have used the first fourteen letters of the classical [[Latin alphabet]] (the letter J did not exist until the 16th century),
:A B C D E F G H I K L M N O,
to signify the notes of the two-octave range that was in use at the time&lt;ref&gt;
Boethius. ''De institutione musica''. Book IV, chap. 14. Ed. Friedlein, 341.&lt;/ref&gt; and in modern [[scientific pitch notation]] are represented as
:A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; G&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; A&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; D&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; G&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

Though it is not known whether this was his devising or common usage at the time, this is nonetheless called ''Boethian notation''. Although Boethius is the first author known to use this nomenclature in the literature, [[Ptolemy]] wrote of the two-octave range five centuries before, calling it the ''perfect system'' or ''complete system'' – as opposed to other, smaller-range note systems that did not contain all possible species of octave (i.e., the seven octaves starting from A, B, C, D, E, F, and G).

Following this, the range (or compass) of used notes was extended to three octaves, and the system of repeating letters A–G in each octave was introduced, these being written as [[lower-case]] for the second octave (a–g) and double lower-case letters for the third (aa–gg). When the range was extended down by one note, to a G, that note was denoted using the Greek letter [[gamma]] (Γ). (It is from this that the French word for scale, ''gamme'' derives, and the English word [[hexachord|gamut]], from "Gamma-Ut", the lowest note in Medieval music notation.)

The remaining five notes of the chromatic scale (the black keys on a piano keyboard) were added gradually; the first being B{{music|flat}}, since B was flattened in certain [[mode (music)|modes]] to avoid the dissonant [[tritone]] interval. This change was not always shown in notation, but when written, B{{music|flat}} (B-flat) was written as a Latin, round "b", and B{{music|natural}} (B-natural) a Gothic script (known as [[Blackletter]]) or "hard-edged" b. These evolved into the modern flat ({{music|flat}}) and natural ({{music|natural}}) symbols respectively. The sharp symbol arose from a barred b, called the "cancelled b".

In parts of Europe, including [[Germany]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], [[Norway]], [[Denmark]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Finland]] and [[Iceland]] (and [[Sweden]] before about 1990s), the Gothic b transformed into the letter H (possibly for ''hart'', German for ''hard'', or just because the Gothic b resembled an H). Therefore, in German music notation, H is used instead of B{{music|natural}} (B-natural), and B instead of B{{music|flat}} (B-flat). Occasionally, music written in German for international use will use H for B-natural and B&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; for B-flat (with a modern-script lower-case b instead of a flat sign). Since a Bes or B{{music|flat}} in Northern Europe (i.e., a B{{music|bb}} elsewhere) is both rare and unorthodox (more likely to be expressed as Heses), it is generally clear what this notation means.

In Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, French, Romanian, Greek, Russian, Mongolian, Flemish, Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Ukrainian, Bulgarian and Turkish notation the notes of scales are given in terms of Do–Re–Mi–Fa–Sol–La–Si rather than C–D–E–F–G–A–B. These names follow the original names reputedly given by [[Guido d'Arezzo]], who had taken them from the first syllables of the first six musical phrases of a [[Gregorian chant]] melody "[[Ut queant laxis]]", which began on the appropriate scale degrees. These became the basis of the [[solfège]] system. "Do" later replaced the original "Ut" for ease of singing (most likely from the beginning of ''Dominus'', Lord), though "Ut" is still used in some places. "Si" or "Ti" was added as the seventh degree (from ''Sancte Johannes'', St. John, to whom the hymn is dedicated). The use of "Si" versus "Ti" varies regionally.

The two notation systems most commonly used today are the [[Helmholtz pitch notation]] system and the [[scientific pitch notation]] system. As shown in the table above, they both include several octaves, each starting from C rather than A. The reason is that the most commonly used scale in Western music is the [[major scale]], and the sequence C–D–E–F–G–A–B–C (the [[C major]] scale) is the simplest example of a major scale. Indeed, it is the only major scale that can be obtained using [[natural note]]s (the white keys on the piano keyboard) and is typically the first musical scale taught in music schools.

In a newly developed system, primarily in use in the United States, notes of scales become independent of music notation. In this system the natural symbols C–D–E–F–G–A–B refer to the absolute notes, while the names Do–Re–Mi–Fa–So–La–Ti are relativized and show only the relationship between pitches, where Do is the name of the base pitch of the scale, Re is the name of the second pitch, etc. The idea of so-called movable Do, originally suggested by [[John Curwen]] in the 19th century, was fully developed and involved into a whole educational system by [[Zoltán Kodály]] in the middle of the 20th century, which system is known as the [[Kodály method]] or Kodály concept.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22383">'''Space neuroscience''' is the scientific study of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) functions during [[spaceflight]]. [[Living systems]] can integrate the inputs from the [[senses]] to navigate in their environment and to coordinate [[Human position|posture]], [[Walking|locomotion]], and [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movements]]. [[Gravity]] has a fundamental role in controlling these functions. In [[weightlessness]] during spaceflight, integrating the sensory inputs and coordinating motor responses is harder to do because gravity is no longer sensed during [[free-fall]]. For example, the [[otolith]] organs of the [[vestibular system]] no longer signal head tilt relative to gravity when [[standing]]. However, they can still sense head translation during body motion. Ambiguities and changes in how the gravitational input is processed can lead to potential errors in [[perception]], which affects [[spatial orientation]] and [[mental representation]]. Dysfunctions of the [[vestibular system]] are common during and immediately after spaceflight, such as [[space motion sickness]] in orbit and [[balance disorder]]s after return to Earth.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience in Space"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Clément G, Reschke M|title=Neuroscience in Space |publisher=Springer: New York |year=2008|url=https://www.springer.com/astronomy/space+exploration/book/978-0-387-78949-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptation to [[weightlessness]] involves not just the [[Sensory-motor coupling]] functions, but some [[autonomic nervous system]] functions as well. [[Sleep disorders]] and [[orthostatic intolerance]] are also common during and after spaceflight. There is no [[hydrostatic pressure]] in a weightless environment. As a result, the redistribution of body fluids toward the upper body causes a decrease in leg volume, which may affect [[muscle]] [[viscosity]] and [[compliance (medicine)|compliance]]. An increase in [[intracranial pressure]] may also be responsible for a decrease in near [[visual acuity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mader TM, Gibson R, Pass AF, etal | title = Optic disc edema, globe flattening, choroidal folds, and hyperopic shifts observed in astronauts after long-duration space slight | journal = Ophthalmology | volume = 118 | pages = 2058–2069 | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, muscle mass and strength both decrease as a result of the reduced loading in [[weightlessness]]. Moreover, approximately 70% of astronauts experience [[space motion sickness]] to some degree during the first days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Crampton GH |title=Motion and Space Sickness |publisher=CRC Press: Boca Raton |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drugs commonly used to combat motion sickness, such as [[Hyoscine hydrobromide|scopolamine]] and [[promethazine]], have soporific effects. These factors can lead to chronic [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. The challenge of integrative [[space medicine]] and physiology is to investigate the adaptation of the human body to spaceflight as a whole, and not just as the sum of body parts because all body functions are connected and interact with each other.

==History of space neuroscience==
[[Image:braininspace.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Space neuroscience is the scientific study of [[central nervous system]] functions during and after [[human spaceflight]].]]
To date, only three countries, the [[NASA|United States]], [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Russia]], and [[China National Space Administration|China]], have the capability to launch humans into orbit. However, 520 [[astronaut]]s from more than thirty different countries have flown in space and many of them have participated in '''space neuroscience''' research. The launch of the first living animal in orbit on [[Sputnik]] on November 3, 1957 marked the beginning of a rich history of unique scientific and technological achievements in space [[life sciences]] that have spanned more than fifty years to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Clément G, Slenzka K|title=Fundamentals of Space Biology. Research on Cells, Plants and Animals in Space |publisher=Springer: New York |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first documented '''space neuroscience''' experiments were performed during the third human mission on board the Russian [[Vostok programme|Vostok]] spacecraft.  These experiments began after the crew from previous missions complained from [[nausea]] and [[spatial disorientation]] in [[weightlessness]]. Space neuroscience experiments typically addressed these operational issues until the [[Skylab]] and [[Salyut]] space stations were made available for more fundamental research on the effect of gravity on CNS functions. Approximately 400 '''space neuroscience''' experiments have been performed from Vostok-3 in August 1962 to the Expedition-15 on board the [[International Space Station]] in October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |vauthors=Reschke MF, Krnavek JM, Somers JT, etal |title=A brief history of space flight with a comprehensive compendium of vestibular and sensorimotor research conducted across the various flight programs |publisher=NASA Johnson Space Center: Houston |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operational aspects==

Sensory and sensorimotor disturbances when arriving in low Earth orbit are well documented, the most known of these being [[space motion sickness]] (SMS). Individual differences, spacecraft size, and body movements cause SMS symptoms. Typically lasting the first three or four days of weightlessness, symptoms range from [[headaches]] and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] to [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]]. The consequences vary from simple discomfort to possible incapacitation, creating potential problems during [[extra-vehicular activity]], re-entry, and emergency egress from the spacecraft. The body receives a variety of conflicting signals from the visual, somato-sensory, and vestibular organs in weightlessness. These conflicting inputs are thought to be the primary cause of SMS, but the precise mechanisms of the conflict are not well understood. Medications currently used to alleviate the symptoms produce undesirable side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Clément G |title=Fundamentals of Space Medicine - 2nd Edition |publisher=Springer: New York |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astronauts must remain alert and vigilant while operating complicated equipment. Therefore, getting enough [[sleep]] is a crucial factor of mission success. Weightlessness, a confined and isolated environment, and busy schedules coupled with the absence of a regular 24-hour day make [[sleep]] difficult in space. Astronauts typically average only about six hours of sleep each night. Cumulative sleep loss and sleep disruption could lead to performance errors and accidents that pose significant [[risk]] to mission success. Sleep and [[circadian cycles]] also temporally modulate a broad range of physiological, hormonal, behavioral, and cognitive functions.

Methods to prevent sleep loss, reduce [[human error]], and optimize mental and physical performance during long-duration spaceflight are being investigated. Particular concerns include the effect of the space environment on higher-order cognitive processes like [[decision-making]] and the impact of changing gravity on mental functions, which will be important if [[artificial gravity]] is considered as a [[countermeasure]] for future interplanetary space missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Clément G, Bukley A|title=Artificial Gravity |publisher=Springer: New York |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also necessary to develop human-response measurement technologies to assess the crew's ability to perform flight-management tasks effectively. Simple and reliable behavioral and psycho-physiological response measurement systems are needed to assess mental loading, [[stress (psychological)|stress]], task engagement, and [[situation awareness]] during spaceflight.

==Sensory functions in space==

All living organisms on Earth have the ability to sense and respond to changes in their internal and external environment. Organisms, including humans, must accurately sense before they can react, thus ensuring [[Survival: A Thematic Guide to Canadian Literature|survival]]. The body senses the environment by specialized sensory organs. The CNS utilizes these sensations in order to coordinate and organize muscle activities, shift from uncomfortable positions, and adjust [[Balance (ability)|balance]] properly. In common speech, five different [[senses]] are usually recognized: [[visual system|vision]], [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[Olfaction|smell]], [[taste]], and [[touch]]. All these senses are somewhat affected by weightlessness.

In fact, the human body has seven sensory systems – not five. The sixth and seventh systems are the senses of motion located in the inner ear. The former signals the beginning and end of rotation and the latter signals body tilt relative to gravity as well as body translation. The seventh system no longer provides tilt information in weightlessness; however, it does continue to signal translation, so the afferent signals to the CNS are confusing. The experience of living and working in space alters the way the CNS interprets the otolith organ signals during [[linear acceleration]]. Although the perception is fairly accurate when subjects are exposed to angular acceleration in [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]] in-flight, there are disturbances during angular rotation in [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|pitch]] and [[Flight dynamics|roll]], and during linear acceleration along the body transversal and longitudinal axes. Perception of body motion is also altered during the same motion immediately after landing. There is an adaptation to weightlessness in orbit that carries over to post-flight reactions to linear acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Young LR, Oman CM, Watt DG, etal | title = Spatial orientation in weightlessness and readaptation to Earth’s gravity | journal = Science | volume = 225 | pages = 205–208 | year = 1984 | doi=10.1126/science.6610215| bibcode=1984Sci...225..205Y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posture, movement, and locomotions==

Exposure to weightlessness causes changes to the signals from the receptors to [[touch]], [[pressure]], and [[gravity]], i.e., all information necessary for postural stability. Adaptive modifications in the central processing of sensory information take place to produce motor responses that are appropriate for the new gravitational environment. As a result, terrestrial motor strategies are progressively abandoned in weightlessness, as astronauts adapt to the weightless environment. This is particularly true for the major postural [[muscles]] found in the lower legs. The modifications in posture, movement, and locomotion acquired in reduced gravity are then inappropriate for Earth's gravity upon return. After landing, [[Balance disorder|postural instability]] approaching clinical [[ataxia]] is manifested as a result of this in-flight neural reorganization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clément G, Gurfinkel VS, Lestienne F, Lipshits MI, Popov KE | title = Adaptation of postural control to weightlessness | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 57 | pages = 61–72 | year = 1984 | doi=10.1007/bf00231132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Difficulties with [[standing]], [[walking]], turning corners, climbing stairs, and a slowing of [[gait]] are experienced as astronauts re-adapt to Earth's gravity, until terrestrial motor strategies are fully re-acquired. Adaptation to spaceflight also induces a significant increase in the time required to traverse an obstacle course on landing day, and recovery of [[Balance (ability)|functional mobility]] takes an average of two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Reschke MF, Bloomberg JJ, Harm DL, etal | title = Posture, locomotion, spatial orientation, and motion sickness as a function of space flight | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 28 | pages = 102–117 | year = 1998 | doi=10.1016/s0165-0173(98)00031-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties can have adverse consequences for an astronauts’ ability to stand up or escape from the vehicle during emergencies and to function effectively immediately after leaving the spacecraft after flight. Thus it is important to understand the cause of these profound impairments of posture and locomotion stability, and develop [[countermeasures]].

The most significant sensorimotor problems astronauts will face during a stay on the Moon and Mars are likely to occur when walking around in their [[space suits]]. The suits are big and bulky and change the body's [[center of gravity]]. This along with the uneven terrain and limited field of view makes locomotion challenging.

==Compensatory eye movements==

The function of the [[vestibular system]] during spaceflight is by far the most carefully studied of all. This is especially true of the gravity-sensing [[otolith organs]] and their relationship to [[eye movement (sensory)|eye movement]]s. The vestibular [[semicircular canal]] function seems unchanged in weightlessness because the horizontal eye movements that compensated for head [[yaw (rotation)|yaw]] rotation are not affected by spaceflight. The absence of gravity stimulation of the otoliths reduces the torsional [[vestibulo-ocular reflex]] during head [[Flight dynamics|roll]] rotation in microgravity. This deficit is absent when astronauts are exposed to [[centrifugal force]]s, suggesting that the adaptive CNS changes are taking place centrally rather than peripherally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Clément G | title = Alteration of eye movements and motion perception in microgravity | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 28 | pages = 161–172 | year = 1998 | doi=10.1016/s0165-0173(98)00036-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first days in orbit, the asymmetry of vertical eye movements in response to moving visual scenes is inverted. A return to symmetry of the [[vestibulo-ocular reflex|vestibulo-ocular]] and [[optokinetic reflex]]es is then observed. Some studies have shown increased latencies and decreased peak velocities of [[saccade]]s, while others have found just the opposite. It is possible that these conflicting results depend on when the measures were obtained during the mission. There is also a serious disruption of [[smooth pursuit]] eye movements, especially in the vertical plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clément G, Moore S, Raphan T, Cohen B | title = Perception of tilt (somatogravic illusion) in response to sustained linear acceleration during space flight | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 138 | pages = 410–418 | year = 2001 | doi=10.1007/s002210100706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human missions to Mars]] will include several transitions between different gravitational environments. These changes will eventually affect the reflex eye movements. A key question is whether astronauts can have different sets of reflexes among which they can rapidly switch based on the gravitational environment. Determination of the dual-adaptive capabilities of reflex eye movements in such circumstances is vitally important so that it can be determined to what extent the [[Sensory-motor coupling]] skills acquired in one-g environment will transfer to others.

==Spatial orientation==
[[Image:Figure1oto.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An astronaut on board the [[International Space Station]] is wearing a head-mounted display for performing a space neuroscience experiment aimed at evaluating changes in perceived depth and distance.]]
In [[weightlessness]], astronauts must rely much more on vision to maintain their [[spatial orientation]], because the [[otolith]] organs can no longer signal the “down” direction. During prolonged exposure, however, reliance seems to shift toward an intrinsic, body vertical reference. The erroneous [[illusions of self-motion]] during head movements performed during and after return to Earth gravity are presumably due to a re-interpretation of [[vestibular system|vestibular inputs]]. Ground-based studies suggest that the CNS resolves the “tilt-translation” [[ambiguity]] based on the frequency content of the [[linear acceleration]] detected by the [[otolith]] organs, with low frequency indicating “tilt” and high frequency indicating “translation”. A crossover exists at about 0.3&amp;nbsp;Hz where the otolith signals are then ambiguous. Exposure to weightlessness presumably results in a shift of this crossover frequency, which could then contribute to [[spatial disorientation]] and SMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clément G, Denise P, Reschke MF, Wood SJ | title = Human ocular counter-rotation and roll tilt perception during off-vertical axis rotation after spaceflight | journal = Journal of Vestibular Research | volume = 17 | pages = 209–215 | year = 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although investigations of higher cognitive processes, such as [[navigation]] and [[mental rotation]] are limited,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Léone G | title = The effect of gravity on human recognition of disoriented objects | journal = Brain Research Reviews | volume = 28 | pages = 203–214 | year = 1998 | doi=10.1016/s0165-0173(98)00040-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; the astronauts frequently report that the spacecraft interiors look longer and higher than they actually are, and a reduction in the perceived height of three-dimensional objects is observed in-flight compared with pre-flight, suggesting an alteration in the [[mental representation]] of three-dimensional cues in weightlessness. [[Perception]] is a model of the brain, a hypothesis about the world that presupposes the [[Newton's laws of motion]]. These laws change in weightlessness and, therefore, one could expect changes in the mental representation of objects’ shape and distance during spaceflight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Villard E, Tintó Garcia-Moreno F, Peter N, Clément G | title = Geometric visual illusions in microgravity during parabolic flight | journal = NeuroReport | volume = 16 | pages = 1395–1398 | year = 2005 | doi=10.1097/01.wnr.0000174060.34274.3e}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rare investigations carried out in space so far have not demonstrated drastic changes, probably because the CNS continues to use an [[Mental model|internal model]] of gravity, at least for a short while.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=McIntyre J, Zago M, Berthoz A, etal | title = Does the brain model Newton's laws? | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 4 | pages = 693–695 | year = 2001 | doi = 10.1038/89477 | pmid=11426224}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be speculated that the way of processing three dimensions will be more developed after a long absence of a gravitational reference.

Further investigations carried out in space will perhaps reveal that other higher cortical functions are impaired in weightless conditions. The combination of [[virtual reality]] with  the measurement of [[evoked potentials]] and [[brain mapping]] on board the International Space Station should provide exciting results on the adaptive mechanisms of cerebral functions in weightlessness.

==Neuroscience and space exploration==

From [[Voskhod programme|Voskhod]] to the [[International Space Station]], spacecraft have improved in size and comfort and have allowed more and more people traveling into orbit. However, even with all of the human spaceflight experience gained over the past fifty years, no single completely effective countermeasure, or combination of countermeasures, exists against the negative effects of long-duration exposure to weightlessness. If a crew of astronauts were to embark on a six-month journey to Mars today, the countermeasures currently employed would presumably leave them less operational after landing.&lt;ref name="Neuroscience in Space" /&gt;

Many believe that physiological adaptation to Mars gravity (0.38 G) and re-adaptation to Earth gravity (1 G) would be enhanced by frequent exposure to [[artificial gravity]] on board the spacecraft en route to and from Mars. This would require an on-board human-rated [[centrifuge]] or spacecraft rotation to produce a [[centrifugal force]] similar to gravity. This solution, while potentially effective, raises a number of operational, engineering, and physiological issues that will need to be addressed. The human physiological responses to long-duration exposure to anything other than zero-gravity or Earth's gravity are unknown. Research is needed to identify the minimum level, duration, and frequency of gravity level required to maintain normal CNS functions, as well as the importance of a [[gravity gradient]] across the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Young LR | title = Vestibular reactions to space flight: Human factors issues | journal = Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine | volume = 71 | pages = A100–A104 | year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex functioning of the CNS, even in the 1-G environment of Earth, has not revealed all its secrets. The most basic '''space neuroscience''' questions must be answered to minimize risks and optimize crew performance during transit and planetary operations. The results of this research will certainly find other applications in [[medicine]] and [[biotechnology]]. Our ability to understand how Earth’s gravitational environment has shaped the evolution of sensory and motor systems can give us a clearer understanding of the fundamental mechanisms of CNS functions. Knowledge of the effects of gravity on CNS functions in humans, as well as elucidation of the basic mechanisms by which these effects occur, will be of direct benefit to understanding the impact of, and providing countermeasures for, long-term exposure of humans to the [[weightlessness]] of spaceflight and the partial gravity of [[Moon]] and [[Mars]] bases.

'''Paleoenzymology''' (British: palaeoenzymology) is the study of prehistoric life through the properties of [[enzymes]] present in those organisms. Ancient enzymes can be [[Ancestral sequence reconstruction|reconstructed]] if their [[Protein sequence|sequences]] can be inferred from the sequences of current enzymes. Such inferrence is possible through [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] techniques such as [[Maximum Likelihood|maximum likelihood]] and [[Bayesian inference in phylogeny|Bayesian inference]].

== Examples ==
One example is the reconstruction of [[thioredoxin]] enzymes from up to 4 billion year old organisms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perez-Jimenez|first=Raul|author2=Alvaro Inglés-Prieto|author3=Zi-Ming Zhao|author4=Inmaculada Sanchez-Romero|author5=Jorge Alegre-Cebollada|author6=Pallav Kosuri|author7=Sergi Garcia-Manyes|author8=T Joseph Kappock|author9=Masaru Tanokura|date=3 April 2011|title=Single-molecule paleoenzymology probes the chemistry of resurrected enzymes|url=http://www.nature.com/nsmb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nsmb.2020.html|journal=Nature Structural &amp; Molecular Biology|volume=18|issue=5|pages=592–6|doi=10.1038/nsmb.2020|pmid=21460845|accessdate=3 April 2011|author10=Arne Holmgren|author11=Jose M Sanchez-Ruiz|author12=Eric A Gaucher|author13=Julio M Fernandez|pmc=3087858}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the chemical activity of these reconstructed enzymes were remarkably similar to modern enzymes, their physical properties showed significantly elevated thermal and acidic stability. These results were interpreted as suggesting that ancient life may have evolved in oceans that were much hotter and more acidic than today.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Promession''' is an idea of how to dispose [[Disposal of human corpses|human remains]] by way of [[freeze drying]]. The concept of promession was developed by [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[biologist]] Susanne Wiigh-Mäsak, who derived the name from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word for "promise" (''promessa'').&lt;ref name=holst&gt;{{cite news|last=Holst|first=Karen|title=Swedish green-burial firm to turn frozen corpses in compost|url=http://www.thelocal.se/33178/20110413/|accessdate=26 September 2012|date=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She founded [[Promessa Organic]]&amp;nbsp;[[Aktiebolag|AB]] in 1997 to commercially pursue her idea.&lt;ref name=undertaker&gt;{{cite news|last=McNally|first=Patrick|title=Promession: A Return to the Living Soil|url=http://www.dailyundertaker.com/2008/09/promession-return-to-living-soil.html|accessdate=26 September 2012|newspaper=Daily Undertaker|date=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was liquidated 2015 without being able to produce a functioning facility. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bohuslaningen.se/nyheter/orust/promessa-slutligen-i-konkurs-1.925619|title=Promessa slutligen i konkurs|work=Bohusläningen|access-date=2018-09-12|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of promession is questioned and not a functional method according to critics.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=1637&amp;artikel=3818201|title=Ekologisk begravning - Studio Ett|last=Radio|first=Sveriges|website=sverigesradio.se|language=sv|access-date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
Promession involves five steps:
# [[Coffin]] separation: the body is placed into the chamber
# Cryogenic freezing: [[liquid nitrogen]] at −196 [[°C]] crystallizes the body
# Vibration: the body is disintegrated into particles within minutes
# Freeze drying: particles are freeze dried in a drying chamber, leaving approximately 30% of the original weight
# Metal separation: any metals (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;tooth [[Amalgam (dentistry)|amalgam]], [[Hip replacement|artificial hip]]s, etc.) are removed, either by magnetism or by sieving. The dry powder is placed in a [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] [[casket]] which is interred in the top [[Soil horizon|layers of soil]], where aerobic bacteria decompose the remains into [[humus]] in as little as 6–12 months.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3293">{{Refimprove|article|date=September 2008}}'''Pyrophilia''' is a relatively uncommon [[paraphilia]] in which a subject derives gratification from [[fire]] and fire-starting activity. It is distinguished from [[pyromania]] by the gratification being of a [[Human sexuality|sexual]] nature.

==Description==
While the erotic focus immediately raises the diagnostic issue of pyromania, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV]] classifies this disorder as an [[impulse-control disorder]], with nothing to indicate or suggest an overlap between this disorder and the paraphilias.

Other than the purposeful act of fire-setting itself, there is no mention of the possibility that the tension or affective arousal experienced before the act; the fascination with, interest in, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (for example, [[paraphernalia]], uses, consequences); or the pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting, witnessing, or participating in the aftermath of fires might be sexual in nature or even contain a [[sexual arousal]] component.

Some described cases of pyrophilia do not include behaviors commonly associated with pyromania, such as being a regular “watcher” at fires in his neighbourhood; setting off [[false alarm]]s; deriving pleasure from institutions, equipment, and personnel associated with fire, spending time at the local [[fire station]], setting fires in order to be affiliated with the fire department; and either showing indifference to the consequences to life and property caused by the fire or deriving satisfaction from the resulting destruction of property. [[Orgasm|Sexual gratification]] need not involve actual fire; arousal or [[masturbatory]] aids may include fantasies or talk of setting a fire. In other instances, the patient may derive arousal primarily from setting or watching their fire.

Pyrophilia has been diagnosed in very few instances, and is not fully accepted by the general [[psychological]] community.{{citation needed|date=March 2010}}.

Pyrophilia is the main subject of [[Ricardo Abdahllah]]'s novel [[Pyretta Blaze]]{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} and [[Type O Negative]] song inspired by and named after the book. Pyrophilia is also seen in [[George R.R. Martin]]'s novel series [[A Song of Ice and Fire]], where several characters including [[Aerys Targaryen]] show symptoms of Pyrophilia and Pyromania.

A '''replica''' is an exact [[copying|reproduction]], such as of a [[painting]], as it was executed by the original artist or a copy or reproduction, especially one on a [[scale (ratio)|scale]] smaller than the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Replica|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/replica|work=Merriam Webster Dictionary|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Replica|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/replica|work=The Free Online Dictionary|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A replica is a [[copying]] closely resembling the [[original]] concerning its shape and appearance. An inverted [[microtechnology|replica]] complements the original by filling its gaps. It can be a copy used for historical purposes, such as being placed in a [[museum]]. Sometimes the original never existed. Replicas and reproductions can be related to any form of licensing an image for others to use, whether it is through photos, postcards, prints, miniature or full size copies they represent a resemblance of the original object.

"Not all incorrectly attributed items are intentional [[forgeries]]. In the same way that a [[museum]] shop might sell a [[printmaking|print]] of a painting or a replica of a [[vase]], copies of [[statue]]s, paintings, and other precious [[cultural artifact|artifacts]] have been popular through the ages.&lt;ref name="Hamma"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hamma|first=Kenneth|title=Public Domain Art in an Age of Easier Mechanical Reproducibility|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/hamma/11hamma.html|publisher=D-Lib Magazine|accessdate=March 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, replicas have often been used illegally for [[forgery]] and [[counterfeit]]s, especially of money and coins, but also commercial merchandise such as [[designer label]] clothing, luxury bags and accessories, and luxury [[watches]]. In arts or collectible automobiles, the term "replica" is used for discussing the non-original recreation, sometimes hiding its real identity.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In motor racing, especially motorcycling, often manufacturers will produce a street version product with the colours of the vehicle or clothing of a famous racer. This is not the actual vehicle or clothing worn during the race by the racer, but a fully officially approved brand-new street-legal product in similar looks. Typically found in helmets, race suits/clothing, and motorcycles, they are coloured in the style of racers, and often carry the highest performance and safety specifications of any street-legal products. These high-performance race-look products termed "Replica", are priced higher and are usually more sought-after than plain colours of the same product.

Because of [[gun control|gun ownership restrictions]] in some locales, gun collectors create non-functional legal replicas of illegal firearms. Such replicas are also preferred to real firearms when used as a [[theatrical property|prop]] in a film or stage performance, generally for safety reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Making a Working Hunting Gun from Antique Brunswick Rifle Parts|url = http://www.ammoland.com/2014/07/making-a-working-hunting-gun-from-antique-brunswick-rifle-parts/#axzz3xPelfjO1|website = AmmoLand.com Shooting Sports News|access-date = 2016-01-16|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[prop replica]] is an authentic-looking duplicate of a prop from a video game, movie or television show.

==Background==

"Replicas represent a copy or forgery of another object and we often think of forgeries we think of paintings but, in fact, anything that is collectible and expensive is an attractive item to forge".&lt;ref name="Hamma"/&gt;

Replicas have been made by people to preserve a perceived link to the past. This can be linked to a historical past or specific time-period or just to commemorate an experience. Replicas and reproductions of [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] help provide a material representation of the past for the public. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==Replicas of artifacts and art==

[[File:General Terracotta Warrior.jpg|thumb|A General Terracotta Replica Warrior {{convert|3+1/2|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}]]

Replicas of artifacts and [[arts|art]] have a purpose within [[museum]]s and research. They are created to help with preserving of original artifacts. In many cases the original artifact may be too frail and be to much at risk of further damage on display posing a risk to the artifact from light damage, environmental agents, and other risks greater than in secure storage.&lt;ref name="Goff"&gt;{{cite web|last=Goff|first=Kent J.|title=Reproductions of Original Artifacts in Museum Programming and Exhibits|url=http://www.mvep.org/MCMgmtpaper.htm|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replicas are created for the purpose of experimental archaeology where archaeologists and material analysts try to understand the ways that an artifact was created and what technologies and skills were needed for the people to create the artifact on display.&lt;ref name="Goff"/&gt;

Another reason for the creation of replica artifacts, is for museums to be able to send originals around the globe or allow other museums or events to educate people on the history of specific artifacts. Replicas are also put on display in museums when further research is being conducted on the artifact, but further display of the artifact in real or replica form is important for public access and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Goff"/&gt;

==Authenticity and replicas==

Replicas and their original representation can be seen as fake or real depending on the viewer. Good replicas take much education related to understanding all the processes and history that go behind the culture and the original creation. To create a good and authentic replica of an object, there is to be a skilled artisan or forger to create the same authentic experience that the original object provides.&lt;ref name="Goff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goff|first=Kent J. |title=Reproductions of Original Artifacts in Museum Programming and Exhibits|url=http://www.mvep.org/MCMgmtpaper.htm|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process takes time and much money to be done correctly for museum standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knell|first=Simon|title=Care of Collections|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=9780203974711|pages=296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s6awQjJQU4C&amp;dq=%22Do+objects+have+a+Finite+Lifetime%3F%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authenticity or real feeling presented by an object can be “described as the experience of an ‘aura’ of an original.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtorf|first=Cornelius|title=From Stonehenge to Las Vegas: Archaeology as Popular Culture|year=2005|publisher=Altamira press|isbn=0-7591-0267-8|pages=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aura of an object is what an object represents through its previous history and experience.&lt;ref name="Holtorf"&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtorf|first=Cornelius|title=From Stonehenge to Las Vegas:Archaeology as Popular Culture|year=2005|publisher=Altamira press|isbn=0-7591-0267-8|pages=112–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Replicas work well in museum settings because they have the ability to look so real and accurate that people can feel the authentic feelings that they are supposed to get from the originals. Through the context and experience that a replica can provide in a museum setting, people can be fooled into seeing it as ‘original’.&lt;ref name="Holtorf"/&gt;

The authenticity of a replica is important for the impression it gives off to tourists or observers. 
“According to Trilling, the original use of authenticity in tourism was in museums where experts wanted to determine 'whether objects of art are what they appear to be or are claimed to be, and therefore worth the price that is asked for them or…. worth the admiration they are being given'.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trilling|first=Lionel|title=Sincerity and Authenticity|year=1972|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0674808614|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steiner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Carol J.|title=Reconceptualizing object authenticity|journal=Annals of Tourism Research|date=January 2006|volume=33|issue=1|pages=65–86|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160738305000897|accessdate=25 March 2012|doi=10.1016/j.annals.2005.04.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These reproductions and the values of authenticity presented to the public through artifacts in museums provide “truth”.  However, authenticity has a way of also being represented in what the public expects in a predictable manner or based on stereotypes within museums.&lt;ref name="Steiner"/&gt; This idea of authenticity also relates to cultural artifacts like food, cultural activities, festivals, housing, and dress that helps to homogenize the cultures that are being represented and make them seem static.&lt;ref name="Steiner"/&gt;

For luxury goods, the same authentic feel has to be present for consumers to want to buy a “fake” designer bag or watch that provides them with the same feelings and desired experiences, but as well achieves the look of higher class.

==Examples of replicas==

[[Image:050114 2529 difference.jpg|thumb|The replica Difference Engine No. 2 in the [[Science Museum, London]]]]
[[File:Bugatti Esders Roadster Royale.jpg|thumb|Replica of a [[Bugatti Royale|1932 Bugatti Type 41]] "Esders Roadster Royale"]]

Replicas and reproductions are also for purely consumption and personal value. Through souvenirs people can own their very own physical representation of their experience or passions. 
People can buy on-line full size replicas (museum-quality) of the Rosetta Stone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosetta stone replicas|url=http://www.freemaninstitute.com/rosettastone.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or prints and museum-quality copies of the Mona Lisa and other famous pieces of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mona Lisa posters|url=http://www.allposters.com/-st/Mona-Lisa-da-Vinci-Posters_c83942_.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, [[Difference Engine]] No. 2, designed by [[Charles Babbage]] in the 19th century, was reconstructed from original drawings studied by [[Allan Bromley (historian)|Allan Bromley]] in the 1980s and is now on display at the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] in [[London]], [[England]]. A second example is [[Stephenson's Rocket]] where a replica was built in 1979, following the original design fairly closely, but with some adaptations.

In China the terra-cotta warriors can be recreated to be personalized for customers. The “Talented craftspeople use their hands and proper tools reproducing every masterwork precisely in the same manner as the royal craftsmen did 2200 years ago. They are made from the same local clay as the originals and constructed essentially in the same ancient method.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Factory Tour Lintong, Xi'an: How to make Xian Qin Terracotta Warrior Statues Soldiers?|url=http://www.online-shopping-china.com/tcwft.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These warriors can come in a variety of sizes and provide a very realistic and authentic experience with their own personal warrior.

As the white mark prestige comes from the imitation of iPhone, the white marks are the most popular brands in the world. Knock-off brand label fashions and accessories  like Louis Vuitton, Coach, Chanel, and Rolex are major labels that get copied.

==Issues and controversies==
[[Controversies]] with replicas (museum context) are associated with who owns the past.

With works of art museums assert their intellectual property rights for replicas and reproduction of images which many museums use commercial licensing for providing access to images. Issues are arising with more images being available on the internet and it being free access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamma|first=Kenneth|title=Public Domain Art in an Age of Easier Mechanical Reproducibility|journal=D-Lib Magazine|date=November 2005|volume=11|issue=11|url=http://www.dlib.org/dlib/november05/hamma/11hamma.html|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists can claim [[copyright infringement]] related to displays of their work in a context they did not approve of which can be the creation of replicas of their pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bamberger|first=Alan|title=Copyright Infringement, Reproduction Rights, and Artist Careers|url=http://www.artbusiness.com/reprosuit.html|work=The art business. com|accessdate=21 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With replica artifacts the copies to be “museum-quality” have to reach a high standard and can cost a lot of money to be produced.&lt;ref name="Goff"/&gt;

Replica artifacts (copies) can provide an authentic view but represents more of the subjectivities of what people expect and desire from their museum experiences and the cultures they learn about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtorf|first=Cornelius|title=From Stonehenge to Las Vegas:Archaeology as Popular Culture|year=2005|publisher=Altamira press|isbn=0-7591-0267-8|pages=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With copies of retail and other counterfeit goods there is a legal issue related to copyright and trademark ownership.

[[Image:IncunabulumDetail.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Detail from a rare [[Blackletter]] [[Bible]] (1497) printed and rubricated in [[Strasbourg]] by [[Johann Grüninger]].]]
'''Rubrication''' was one of several steps in the [[medieval]] process of [[manuscript]] making. Practitioners of rubrication, so-called ''rubricators'', were specialized [[scribe]]s who received text from the manuscript's original scribe and supplemented it with additional text in red [[ink]] for emphasis. The term ''rubrication'' comes from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''rubrico'', "to color red".

== History ==
The practice usually entailed the addition of red headings to mark the end of one section of text and the beginning of another. Such headings were sometimes used to introduce the subject of the following section or to declare its purpose and function. Rubrication was used so often in this regard that the term ''[[rubric]]'' was commonly used as a generic term for headers of any type or color, though it technically referred only to headers to which red ink had been added. In liturgical books such as [[missal]]s, red may also be used to give the actions to be performed by the celebrant or others, leaving the texts to be read in black. Important feasts in liturgical calendars were also often rubricated,{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 | pp = 24–25}} and rubrication can indicate how scribes viewed the importance of different parts of their text.

Rubrication may also be used to emphasize the starting [[grapheme |character]] of a [[canto]] or other division of text; this was often important because manuscripts often consist of multiple works in a single bound volume. This particular type of rubrication is similar to flourishing, wherein red ink is used to style a leading character with artistic loops and swirls. However, this process is far less elaborate than [[illumination (manuscript) |illumination]], in which detailed pictures are incorporated into the manuscript often set in thin sheets of [[gold]] to give the appearance of [[light]] within the text.

Quite commonly the manuscript's initial scribe would provide notes to the rubricator in the form of [[annotation]]s made in the [[Margin (typography) |margins]] of the text. Such notes were effectively indications to "rubricate here" or "add rubric". In many other cases, the initial scribe also held the position of rubricator, and so he applied rubrication as needed without the use of annotations. This is important, as a scribe's annotations to the rubricator can be used along with [[codicology]] to establish a manuscript's history, or [[provenance]].

Later medieval practitioners extended the practice of rubrication to include the use of other colors of ink besides red. Most often, alternative colors included blue and green. After the introduction of [[movable type]] printing, readers continued to expect rubrication, which might be done by hand, if there were few rubrics to add, or by a separate print using a red-ink form, later the normal method. The "great majority of [[incunable]]s did not issue from the press in a finished state… hardly any incunable was considered 'finished' by its printer…", suggesting that hand rubrication provided a sense of legitimacy to the efforts of early printers and their works.  This fact, the notion that something about hand written rubrication completes a printed work by attributing to it a sense of legitimacy and finality, is further supported by the fact that red ink "was not merely decorative… red's original function was to articulate the text by indicating such parts as headings that were so essential to the function of manuscripts that the printers had to deal with them in some way".{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}

==Uses==
The title "generally was written in one or more lines that the scribe of the text had left blank to receive the title", showing both the importance of the section and the knowledge one may gain from this process.{{Sfn | Clemens | Graham | 2007 |  pp = 24–25}}  As mentioned above, the initial scribe of a text often left notes for the rubricator of where rubrication would be necessary, a fact that helps the modern historian learn of the [[provenance]] of the manuscript. Rubrication affected how later generations read and interpreted a text, and this process helped ensure editorial standardization throughout Western Europe.

==Ink==
The recipe for the red ink is given in [[Theophilus Presbyter |Theophilus]]' ''[[De diversis artibus]]'':
{{Quote |
To prepare white-flake, get some sheets of lead beaten out thin, place them dry in a hollow piece of wood and pour in some warm vinegar or urine to cover them. Then, after a month, take off the
cover and remove whatever white there is, and again replace it as at first.  When you have a sufficient amount and you wish to make
red lead from it, grind this flake-white on a stone without water, then put it in two or three new pots and place it over a burning fire.  You have a slender curved iron rod, fitted at one end in a wooden handle and broad at the top, and with this you can stir and mix this flake-white from time to time. You do this for a long time until the red lead becomes visible.{{Sfn |  Smith | 1994 | p = 34}}}}

The process took a long time to complete, but was cheap and used common materials.  The white material is [[White lead |lead carbonate]] and the red material is [[lead(II,IV) oxide]].

The '''Smithsonian Environmental Research Center''' ('''SERC''') is a [[United States]] {{convert|2800|acre|km2|sing=on}} environmental research and educational facility operated by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  It is located on the [[Rhode River|Rhode]] and [[West River (Maryland)|West River]]s near [[Mayo, Maryland|Edgewater]] in [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland]], near the western shore of [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The center's focus  of study is the [[ecosystem]]s of coastal zones, particularly in the Chesapeake Bay [[estuary]] and nearby [[wetlands]].

==History==
In 1964, Robert Lee Forrest of Baltimore left a 365-acre dairy farm on the Rhode River to the Smithsonian Institution.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb&gt;{{cite web|title=About SERC:History|url=http://serc.si.edu/about/history.aspx|work=SERC|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the Chesapeake Center for Field Biology was established on the site of this former dairy farm.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;   A $375,000 grant from the [[Ford Foundation]] was awarded and another $550,000 in other grants followed by the end of 1969.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;  These funds were used to  purchase another 568 additional acres adjoining the original parcel.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;

In 1970, the Chesapeake Bay Center for Field Biology was renamed to the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies (CBCES) and land acquisition continued.&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;

In 1974, Jim Lynch was hired as the first on-site staff scientist.  Lynch had recently finished his Ph.D. from [[University of California, Berkeley]] in [[Zoology]].&lt;ref name=SercHistoryweb/&gt;

==Site==
The 2,600 acre site occupied by SERC contains coastal plain forests, land used for agriculture, wetlands and marshes, and brackish environments.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Colin and Derek Thomas. [https://books.google.com/books?id=j-SrBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA318&amp;dq=%22Smithsonian+Environmental+Research+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwATg8ahUKEwi4v7Hb747JAhUI2SYKHYrDCOU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Smithsonian%20Environmental%20Research%20Center%22&amp;f=false Birds of a Feather: Seasonal Changes on Both Sides of the Atlantic]. Matador. 2014. p.318.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
SERC conducts research on topics that include [[Terrestrial ecoregion#Terrestrial ecoregions|terrestrial]], [[atmospheric]], and [[estuarine]] environmental research within the disciplines of [[botany]], [[ecology]], [[environmental education]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]], [[microbiology]], [[physics]], and [[zoology]]. The center trains interns and graduate students, including pre-doctoral and doctoral students. Annually, the center receives over 10,000 students, teachers, and families who come to visit. It gives advice, consultation, and testimony to local, state, federal, and international governmental agencies, natural resource managers, policy makers, and conservation organizations.

It serves as a center of research and education on human impacts in land-sea interactions of the coastal zone. The center receives $20,000,000 in extramural grants and contracts funded from governmental agencies, foundations, and industry.

SERC developed and maintains an extensive database of [[invasive species]] in marine and estuarine ecosystems. The database tracks details on over 500 invasive species throughout coastal North America. SERC coordinates with the [[United States Geological Survey]], which has developed a similar database for freshwater invasions, and has worked with marine centers in other nations to study marine invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Gollasch, Stephan. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pQzwCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq=%22Smithsonian+Environmental+Research+Center%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBTgyahUKEwjsx9_i9YHJAhVLWT4KHc_sAtY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Smithsonian%20Environmental%20Research%20Center%22&amp;f=false "Databases on Aquatic Alien Species: North and Mediterranean Seas and Non-European Initiatives"], from Invasive Aquatic Species of Europe, Erkki Leppäkoski, Stephan Gollasch, Sergej Olenin eds. Springer Science. 2002. p.522.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical innovation==
The center has been an innovator of biotelemetry to track behavior, habitat use, and movement of [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crabs ''(Callinectes sapidus)'']], a marine predator and a valuable crustacean fishery in North America. They are the  patent holder for the [[Radiometer|Spectral Radiometer]], the national standard for monitoring [[solar radiation]]. The center has  developed a model for testing estuarine water quality and watershed nutrient discharges.

'''Superinsulation''' is an approach to building design, construction, and retrofitting that dramatically reduces heat loss (and gain) by using much higher levels of insulation and airtightness than normal. Superinsulation is one of the ancestors of the [[passive house]] approach.

==Definition==
There is no universally agreed definition of superinsulation, but superinsulated buildings typically include:
* Very high levels of [[Building insulation|insulation]], typically [[R-value (insulation)|R-40 (RSI-7)]] walls and [[R-value (insulation)|R-60 (RSI-10.6)]] roof, corresponding to [[International System of Units|SI]] [[U-value]]s of 0.15 and 0.1 W/(m²·K) respectively)
* Details to ensure insulation continuity where walls meet roofs, foundations, and other walls
* Airtight construction, especially around doors and windows to prevent air infiltration pushing heat in or out
* a [[heat recovery ventilation]] system to provide fresh air
* No large windows facing any particular direction&lt;!-- (unlike [[passive solar]], which uses large windows facing the sun{{Fact|date=February 2009}} and fewer/smaller windows facing other directions).
* No large amounts of [[thermal mass]]{{Fact|date=February 2009}}
* No active or passive solar heat {{Fact|date=February 2009}}(but may have [[solar water heating]] and/or [[hot water heat recycling]]) --&gt;
* Much smaller than conventional heating system, sometimes just a small backup heater

Nisson &amp; Dutt (1985) suggest that a house might be described as "superinsulated" if the cost of space heating is lower than the cost of water heating.&lt;ref&gt;Nisson, J. D. Ned; and Gautam Dutt, ''The Superinsulated Home Book'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1985 {{ISBN|0-471-88734-X}}, {{ISBN|0-471-81343-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
A superinsulated house is intended to reduce heating needs very significantly and may even be heated predominantly by intrinsic heat sources (waste heat generated by appliances and the [[body heat]] of the occupants) with very small amounts of backup heat. This has been demonstrated to work even in very cold climates but requires close attention to construction details in addition to the insulation (see [[IEA Solar Heating &amp; Cooling Implementing Agreement Task 13]]).

==History==
The term "superinsulation" was coined by Wayne Schick at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. In 1976 he was part of a team that developed a design called the "Lo-Cal" house, using computer simulations based on the climate of [[Madison, Wisconsin]]. Several houses, duplexes and condos based on Lo-Cal principles were built in [[Champaign-Urbana]], [[Illinois]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;McCulley, M. (2008, November). ''Pioneering superinsulation and the Lo-Cal House: Design, construction, evaluation and conclusions''. Paper presented at the 3rd Annual North American Passive House Conference, Duluth, MN&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denzerbook"&gt;{{cite book| last =Denzer| first =Anthony| authorlink =| title =The Solar House: Pioneering Sustainable Design| publisher =Rizzoli| series =| volume =| edition =| year =2013| location =| pages =| language =| url =http://solarhousehistory.com/book/| doi =| id =| isbn =978-0847840052| mr =| zbl =| jfm =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20130726200811/http://solarhousehistory.com/book/| archivedate =2013-07-26| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the "Saskatchewan House"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ralko|first1=Joe|url=http://esask.uregina.ca/entry/energy-efficient_houses.html|website=The Encyclopedia of Saskatchewan|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was built in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], by a group of several Canadian government agencies. It was the first house to publicly demonstrate the value of superinsulation and generated a lot of attention. It originally included some experimental evacuated-tube solar panels, but they were not needed and were later removed. The house was heated primarily by waste heat from appliances and the occupants.&lt;ref name="Denzerbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holladay&gt;{{Cite web

In 1977 the "Leger House" was built by Eugene Leger, in [[East Pepperell, Massachusetts]]. It had a more conventional appearance than the "Saskatchewan House", and also received extensive publicity.&lt;ref name="Denzerbook"/&gt;

Publicity from the "Saskatchewan House" and the "Leger House" influenced other builders, and many superinsulated houses were built over the next few years. These houses also influenced [[Wolfgang Feist]] when he developed the [[passive house|Passivhaus standard]].&lt;ref name="Denzerbook"/&gt;

==Retrofits==
It is possible, and increasingly desirable, to retrofit superinsulation to an existing houses or buildings. The easiest way is often to add layers of continuous rigid exterior insulation,&lt;ref&gt;Ueno, K., "Residential Exterior Wall Superinsulation Retrofit Details and Analysis", ASHRAE Buildings 11 Conference, 2010. {{cite web |url=http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-1012-residential-exterior-wall-superinsulation-retrofit |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110128014936/http://www.buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-1012-residential-exterior-wall-superinsulation-retrofit |archivedate=2011-01-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes by building new exterior walls that allow more space for insulation. A [[vapor barrier]] can be installed on the outside of the original framing but may not be needed.  An improved continuous air barrier is almost always worth adding, as older homes tend to be leaky, and such an air barrier can be important for energy savings and durability. Care should be exercised when adding a vapor barrier as it can reduce drying of incidental moisture, or even cause summer (in climates with humid summers) [[interstitial condensation]] and consequent [[mold]] and [[mildew]].  This may cause health problems for the occupants and damage the existing structure. Many builders in northern Canada use a simple 1/3 to 2/3 approach, placing the vapor barrier no further out than 1/3 of the R-value of the insulated portion of the wall.  This method is generally valid for interior walls that have little or no vapor resistance (e.g. they use fibrous insulation) and controls air leakage condensation as well as vapor diffusion condensation. This approach will ensure that condensation does not occur on or to the inside of the vapor barrier during cold weather.  The 1/3:2/3 rule will ensure that the vapor barrier temperature will not fall below the dew point temperature of the interior air, and will minimize the possibility of cold-weather condensation problems.  For example, with an internal room temperature of 20°C (68°F), the vapor barrier will then only reach 7.3 °C (45 °F) when the outside temperatures is at −18°C (-1°F). Indoor air dewpoint temperatures are more likely to be in the order of around 0 °C (32 °F) when it is that cold outdoors, much lower than the predicted vapor barrier temperature, and hence the 1/3:2/3 rules is quite conservative.  For climates that do not often experience -18°C, the 1/3:2/3 rule should be amended to 40:60% or 50:50.  As the interior air dewpoint temperature is an important basis for such rules, buildings with high interior humidities during cold weather (e.g., museums, swimming pools, humdified or poorly ventilated airtight homes) may require different rules, as can buildings with drier interior environments (such as highly ventilated buildings, warehouses).  The 2009 International Residential Code (IRC) embodies more sophisticated rules to guide the choice of insulation on the exterior of new homes, which can be applied when [[retrofitting]] older homes.

A vapor permeable building wrap on the outside of the original wall helps keep the wind out, yet allows the wall assembly to dry to the exterior. [[Asphalt felt]] and other products such as permeable polymer based products are available for this purpose, and usually double as the Water Resistant Barrier / drainage plane as well.

Interior retrofits are possible where the owner wants to preserve the old exterior siding, or where [[building setback|setback]] requirements don't leave space for an exterior retrofit. Sealing the air barrier is more difficult and the thermal insulation continuity compromised (because of the many partition, floor, and service penetrations), the original wall assembly is rendered colder in cold weather (and hence more prone to condensation and slower to dry), occupants are exposed to major disruptions, and the house is left with less interior space.  Another approach is to use the 1/3 to 2/3 method mentioned above — that is, to install a vapor retarder on the inside of the existing wall (if there isn't one there already) and add insulation and support structure to the inside. This way, utilities (power, telephone, cable, and plumbing) can be added in this new wall space without penetrating the air barrier. Polyethylene vapor barriers are risky except in very cold climates, because they limit the wall's ability to dry to the interior. This approach also limits the amount of interior insulation that can be added to a rather small amount (e.g., only R6 can be added to a 2x4 R12 wall).

==Costs and benefits==
In new construction, the cost of the extra insulation and wall framing may be offset by not requiring a dedicated central heating system.  In homes with numerous rooms, more than one floor, air conditioning or large sized, a central furnace is often justified or required to ensure sufficiently uniform temperatures.  Small furnaces are not very expensive and some ductwork to every room is almost always required to provide ventilation air in any case.  When peak demand and annual energy use is low, sophisticated and expensive central heating systems are not often required.  Hence, even electric resistance heaters may be used.  Electric heaters are typically only used on the coldest winter nights when overall demand for electricity is low.  Other forms of backup heater are widely used, such as wood pellets, wood stoves, natural gas boilers or even furnaces. The cost of a superinsulation retrofit should be balanced against the future cost of heating fuel (which can be expected to fluctuate from year to year due to supply problems, natural disasters or geopolitical events), the desire to reduce pollution from heating a building, or the desire to provide exceptional thermal comfort.

During a power failure, a superinsulated house stays warm longer as heat loss is much less than normal, but the thermal storage capacity of the structural materials and contents is the same. Adverse weather may hamper efforts to restore power, leading to outages lasting a week or more. When deprived of their continuous supply of electricity (either for heat directly, or to operate gas-fired [[furnaces]]), conventional houses cool rapidly during, and may be at greater risk of costly damage due to freezing [[water pipes]]. Residents who use supplemental heating methods without proper care during such episodes, or at any other time, may subject themselves to risk of [[Fire#Uncontrolled fire|fire]] or [[carbon monoxide poisoning]].

The '''Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School''' is a scientific [[school of thought]] in the field of [[semiotics]] that was formed in 1964 and led by [[Juri Lotman]]. Among the other members of this school were [[Boris Uspensky]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Mikhail Gasparov]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[Isaak I. Revzin]], and others. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework around the [[semiotics of culture]].

==History==
The Tartu–Moscow School of Semiotics developed an original method of multidimensional [[cultural analysis]]. The languages of culture are interpreted as secondary modelling systems in relation to verbal language. This method permits a productive understanding of the use of different languages of culture.

This school is widely known for its journal, ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' (formerly published in Russian as ''Труды по знаковым системам''), published by [[Tartu University Press]]. It is the oldest semiotics journal in the world, established in 1964.

In its first period, the 1960s and 1970s, TMSS followed a [[structuralism|structuralist]] approach and was strongly influenced by [[Russian formalism]]. Since the 1980s, its approach can be characterized as [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]], and is connected with the introduction of [[Yuri Lotman|Juri Lotman's]] concept of [[semiosphere]] and its relation to [[organicism]].

From 1990s, TMSS has been succeeded by the Tartu Semiotics School, which is based in the Department of Semiotics of the University of Tartu and led by [[Kalevi Kull]], [[Peeter Torop]], [[Mihhail Lotman]], and others.

'''Toothing''' was originally a [[hoax]] claim that [[Bluetooth]]-enabled [[mobile phone]]s or [[Personal Digital Assistant|PDAs]] were being used to arrange random [[Human sexual behavior|sexual encounters]], perpetrated as a prank on the media who reported it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language = Spanish |title=Sexting, toothing y upskirting |url= http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090530/pags/20090530183343.html |work=[[La Nación]] |date=May 31, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax was created by [[Ste Curran]], then Editor at Large at the gaming magazine ''[[Edge (games magazine)|Edge]]'', and ex-journalist Simon Byron. They based it on the two concepts [[Dogging (sexual slang)|dogging]] and [[bluejacking]] that were popular at the time. The creators started a forum in March 2004 where they wrote fake news articles about toothing with other members and then sent them off to well-known Internet-based news services. The point of the hoax was to "highlight how journalists are happy to believe something is true without necessarily checking the facts". Dozens of news organizations, including [[BBC News]], [[Wired News]], and ''[[The Independent]]'' thought the toothing story was real and printed it. On April 4, 2005, Curran and Byron admitted that the whole thing was a hoax. There have, however, been real Bluetooth dating devices to hit the market since.

==Conception==
Devised by Swedish telecommunication company [[Ericsson]], [[Bluetooth]] is an [[Open standard|open]] [[wireless]] protocol for exchanging data over short distances from mobile devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and personal computers. Originally, Bluetooth was only intended for wireless exchanging of files between these devices, but it was later discovered that it could also be used for sexual intentions.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=631721&amp;contrassID=1&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0&amp;listSrc=Y|title=The fast food of sex |last=Dam |first=Alon|date=November 2, 2005|work=[[Haaretz]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax concept of toothing started around March 2004 in the form of a forum designed by [[Ste Curran]], then Editor at Large at games magazine ''[[Edge (games magazine)|Edge]]'', and ex-journalist [[Simon Byron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Silverman |first=Craig |authorlink=Craig Silverman |title=Regret the Error |year=2007 |publisher= [[Sterling Publishing]]| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nPWuVkgl-S0C&amp;pg=PA138&amp;dq=toothing |isbn=1-4027-5153-2 |page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tooth/&gt; Toothing was conceived as a merger of the two concepts [[Dogging (sexual slang)|dogging]] with [[bluejacking]], both of which were frequently mentioned in the UK media around that time. Byron said he and Curran were "idly messaging about the [[Stan Collymore]] dogging scandal, and how this stupid sexual buzzword had (apparently) come from nowhere," when they came up with the concept. "We wondered if we could create our own. We wonder a lot of things, and rarely push them past concept, because we’re as collectively creative as we are frustratingly idle. This particularly concept was simple enough to outstrip the temptations of grinning, saying 'Yeah!', and wandering off to see what was on [television]."&lt;ref name="triforce"/&gt; Several newspapers have also compared toothing to dogging.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="parvaz"/&gt;

In toothing, a Bluetooth device is used to find other Bluetooth enabled devices within a close distance (on trains or buses, for example), and then send the expression "toothing?" as an initial greeting, letting the person with the enabled Bluetooth device know you are looking for sex.&lt;ref name="parvaz"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/gadgets_and_gaming/article852869.ece|title=Technobabble|last=Rowan|first=David|date=April 27, 2004 |work=[[The Times]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ling|first=Rich|author2=Campbell, Scott |title=The Reconstruction of Space and Time: Mobile Communication Practices|publisher=[[Transaction Publishers]]|date=October 31, 2008|page=35|isbn=978-1-4128-0809-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eCHcmsiUA4oC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mathieson|first=Rick|author2=[[American Management Association]] |title=Branding Unbound: The Future of Advertising, Sales, and the Brand Experience in the Wireless Age |publisher=AMACOM|date=August 19, 2005|page=189|isbn=978-0-8144-7287-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Z4_THbJEF0C&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Peter|author2=Lewis, Barry |title=Wireless Networks For Dummies|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=October 2004|series=[[For Dummies]]|page=78|isbn=978-0-7645-7525-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3_S-c8nfqsC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=Toothing}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mennen|first=Andrew|title=It's Your Call: The Complete Guide to Mobile Phones |publisher=Relianz Communications |date=September 1, 2005|page=118|chapter=Security Issues|isbn=978-0-9757883-0-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fTYJey8pLbUC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="seattlepi"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/219419_poppingoff.html|title=Search for Mr./Ms. Right takes wild turns|last=Parvaz|first=D.|date=April 11, 2005|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bevan|first=Rob|author2=Wright, Tim |title=Unleash Your Creativity: Secrets of Creative Genius|publisher=Infinite Ideas Limited|year=2005|page=116|isbn=978-1-904902-17-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kayBh_z-3SEC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt; If sending of text messages via Bluetooth is not possible, the Bluetooth name of the mobile phone can be set to "toothing?" or something else to indicate interest.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/apr/02/wormseyeview|title=A worm's eye view|date=April 2, 2004 |work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair of hoaxers wrote fake news articles on the forum about toothing and sent them off well-known Internet-based news services.

The concept of toothing quickly reached a large audience, even in countries outside of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/allmant/article34479.ece?stjarna=1|title=Telefonsex - på riktigt|last=Karlberg|first=Lars|date=February 23, 2005|work=NyTeknik|language=Swedish|accessdate=2009-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608065308/http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/allmant/article34479.ece?stjarna=1|archivedate=June 8, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/navegante/2007/05/10/tecnologia/1178789937.html|title='Toothing': ¿De bulo a posibilidad real?|date=May 12, 2007|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|language=Spanish|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.infocity.go.it/vedi_articolo.php?id=4088|title=Bluetooth, un turbo anche per il marketing?|last=Pivari|first=Fabrizio|date=August 29, 2004|language=Italian|accessdate=2009-06-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722034656/http://www.infocity.go.it/vedi_articolo.php?id=4088|archivedate=July 22, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heise.de/tp/r4/artikel/19/19832/1.html|title=Toothing - die schnelle Nummer mittels Handy ist ein Hoax|last=Corinth |first=Ernst|date=April 6, 2005|work=[[Telepolis]]|language=German|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curran and Byron said they kept a record from the start of all their mentions in the media, "but there were soon too many to record in full."&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; They agreed to do an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' and "many papers read that and followed up, broadsheet and tabloid, regional, national, all over the planet."&lt;ref name="triforce"/&gt; One of the hoaxers made an appearance on [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], and a member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] reportedly declared his interest in toothing as a way of meeting women.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
One practitioner is Jon, a "Toother" living near London.

"One morning I received an anonymous text message via bluetooth," he told BBC News.

"I didn't understand what had happened, but that evening I did some research and worked out how to send my own."

The pair started to exchange messages on a train station platform; messages which got gradually more flirty.

"Eventually she asked me if I fancied a quickie in the toilets at the station we were travelling to.

"It happened, but I never saw her again."

Since that day Jon - who claims to have had Toothing success five times - has set up a website dedicated to the practice but he admits it takes a degree of perseverance.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Uva33.JPG|thumb|200px|left|The toothing hoax has been studied by a sociologist at 
[[University of Amsterdam]] (pictured).]]
On April 4, 2005, the creators of the forum admitted that the whole thing was a hoax.&lt;ref name="triforce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetriforce.com/newblog/?p=53 |title=Toothing |accessdate=2009-06-24 |publisher=The Triforce }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the concept of toothing is possible, the hoaxers never intended for it to turn into something real. The couple said: "It's like going into a crowded nightclub, throwing a brick at the dance floor with a love letter attached, and hoping that the person it hits will agree to sleep with you."&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; When announcing the hoax, Curran and Byron reassured that toothing was nothing more than a practical joke gone too far and despite all the articles in newspapers and tabloids, "no one has ever ever, ever toothed."&lt;ref name="triforce"/&gt; Shanna Petersen, a sexologist, disagreed with the hoaxers' statement that no-one has ever toothed: "It's simple, doesn't take a lot of guts and rejection is nowhere as personal. Of course it's popular. Show people a new way through which they have a chance to have more sex and they'll do it. No matter how much effort goes into it or how meager the results."&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; Multiple forums were in fact created throughout Europe, Asia and America within months of the original post of toothing. People signed up to the forums looking for good locations in their area to tooth, and to share their toothing stories with other members.&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt; There have later been real Bluetooth dating devices to hit the market.

[[University of Bath]] psychologist Linda Blair said the practice of toothing is down to the human need to take risks: "I think we protect ourselves too much in modern society, and risk is a human need. We need motivation. In some ways this is a tame way of picking people up, it's almost a natural follow up from randomly picking people's names out of the phone book. It's voluntary at all stages, and has choice. As long as that's there and it's legal, then people should be able to do what they want."&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Sue Peters of the [[Terrence Higgins Trust]] worried that anonymous sex made possible by toothing would cause an increase of sexually transmitted diseases such as [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; [[University of Amsterdam]] sociologist [[Albert Benschop]] researched the hoax. He said toothing is "the next logical step" in dating and that the "old game is just adapting to new times". Benschop added that toothing is "just like picking up people in bars but without the silly time-consuming conventions of decorum that people are obliged to keep to these days. This is much more direct. You both know what you want." He also sees it as a way for people "to satisfy their need for intimacy. As long as it helps people out of loneliness and gives them more to enjoy in life, I think it's a very good development."&lt;ref name="Haaretz"/&gt;

The term "toothing" was included in the 2006 version of ''The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English''. It was described as an "anonymous casual sexual activity with any partner arranged over Bluetooth radio technology enabled mobile phones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|author1=Partridge, Eric |author2=Victor Dalzell |year=2006|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis Group]] |isbn=978-0-415-25938-5|page=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, toothing is listed in the ''Sex Slang'' dictionary, authored by Tom Dalzell and Terry Victor, with an explanation similar to the one in the ''New Partridge Dictionary''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dalzell|first=Tom|author2=Victor, Terry |title=Sex Slang|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2007|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ORmeNXr1J2sC&amp;pg=PA185&amp;dq=%22Toothing%22+bluetooth}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toothing was referenced in an episode of the American television series ''[[CSI: Miami]]'', called "[[Killer Date (CSI: Miami)|Killer Date]]", that aired in the United States on April 18, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=[[Killer Date (CSI: Miami)|Killer Date]]|episodelink=|series=CSI: Miami |serieslink=CSI: Miami |credits=[[Elizabeth Devine (writer)|Devine, Elisabeth]]; [[John Haynes (screenwriter)|Haynes, John]]; [[Karen Gaviola|Gaviola, Karen]] |network=[[CBS]] |station= |airdate=April 18, 2005 |season=03 |seriesno= |number= |minutes= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11006">The ''''Two Layer' Hypothesis''', or '''immigration hypothesis''', is an [[Archaeology|archaeological]] theory that suggests the human occupation of mainland [[Southeast Asia]] occurred over two distinct periods by two separate racial groups, hence the term 'layer'.&lt;ref name="reich"&gt;Reich, D., Patterson, N., Kircher, M., Delfin, F., Nandineni, M.R., Pugach, I.,... Stoneking, M. (2011). Denisova admixture and the first modern human dispersals into Southeast Asia and Oceania. The American Journal of Human Genetics, 89(4), 516-528.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Two Layer Hypothesis, early indigenous [[Australo-Melanesian]] peoples comprised the first population of Southeast Asia before their genetic integration with a second wave of inhabitants from East Asia, including Southern China, during the [[Neolithic Revolution|agricultural expansion]] of the [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref name="matsu1"&gt;Matsumura, H., Oxenham, M.F., Dodo, Y., Domett, K. Thuy, N.K., Cuong, N.L.,... Yamagata, M. (2008). Morphometric affinity of the late Neolithic human remains from Man Bac, Ninh Binh Province, Vietnam: key skeletons with which to debate the 'two layer' hypothesis. Anthropological Science, 116(2), 135-148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="matsu2"&gt;Matsumura, H., Hudson, M.J. (2005). Dental perspectives on the population history of Southeast Asia. American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 127(2), 182-209.&lt;/ref&gt;
The majority of evidence for the Two Layer Hypothesis consists of dental and [[Morphometrics|morphometric]] analyses from archaeological sites throughout Southeast Asia, most prominently [[Thailand]] and [[Vietnam]]. The credibility of the Two Layer Hypothesis has been criticized due mainly to similarities between Southeast Asian and Chinese cranial and dental characteristics, excluding Australo-Melanesians.

== History ==

The first fossilized skeletal remains and indication of early 'Proto-Australian' Southeast Asian inhabitants surfaced in 1920 during an excavation by Dubois on the island of [[Java]].&lt;ref name="dubois"&gt;Dubois, E. (1921). The proto-Australian fossil man of Wadjak, Java. Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Weteschappen Proceedings Series B Physical Sciences, 23, 1013-1051.&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite this, a formal connection to mainland Southeast Asia and the suggestion of an initial population of Australomelanesoids was not suggested until 1952 by Koenigswald in his response to Hooijer,&lt;ref name="koen"&gt;Koenigswald, G.H.R. (1952). Evidence of a prehistoric Australomelanesoid population in Malaya and Indonesia. Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 8(1), 92-96.&lt;/ref&gt;  who sharply criticized the attribution of 'big toothed' dental remains to early Australo-Melanesians.&lt;ref name="hooijer"&gt;Hooijer, D.A. (1950). Fossil Evidence of Austromelanesian Migrations in Malaysia? Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, 6(4), 416-422.&lt;/ref&gt;
The immigration hypothesis proposed by Koenigswald was formally termed the 'Two Layer' model by Jacob Teuku. In 1967, Teuku analyzed the cranial and dental proportions of 152 adult skeletal samples recovered from prehistoric sites in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], the majority displaying robust jaws and teeth, prominent [[glabella]]e, and slender, elongated limbs. Teuku argued these characteristics correspond to the Australo-Melanesian population proposed by Koenigswald that predated the East Asian immigrants of the Neolithic; also suggesting the initial inhabitants were likely forced south of Southeast Asia's mainland by the second wave of migrants, due to resource competition or conflict.&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jacob"&gt;Jacob, T. (1967). Some problems pertaining to the racial history of the Indonesian region: a study of human skeletal and dental remains from several prehistoric sites in Indonesia and Malaysia. Drukkerij Neerlandia.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Archaeological evidence ==

=== Thailand ===

Excavations at Moh Khiew Cave resulted in the discovery of a [[Late Pleistocene]] female human skeleton, an [[Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS]] radiocarbon date on a charcoal sample that was gathered from the burial grave gave an age of 25,800 +/- 600 BP.&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt;  Measurements such as the bimaxillary breadth, upper facial height, bicondylar breadth, mandibular length, nasal breadth and height, palatal height, and mandibular angle were compared from the cranial and dental area to other female human specimens from [[East Asia]] and the Southwest Pacific regions. Twelve measurements were used in total for the statistical comparison in addition to 14 buccolingual crown diameters of the maxillary and mandibular teeth.&lt;ref name="matsu3"&gt;Matsumura, H., &amp; Pookajorn, S. (2005). A morphometric analysis of the Late Pleistocene human skeleton from the Moh Khiew Cave in Thailand. HOMO-Journal of Comparative Human Biology, 56(2), 93-118.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a comparison was completed the closest sample to the Moh Khiew Cave sample is the Late Pleistocene Coobool Creek from [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt; The next closest sample is the modern [[Australian Aborigines]].  However, those from [[Flores]], Vietnam, and Thailand are distant samples in comparison.  This discovery suggests that the Moh Khiew Cave skeleton may have shared a common ancestor with Australian Aborigines and [[Melanesians]] and also supports the ‘Two Layer’ hypothesis.

=== Vietnam ===

A study conducted in 2005, examined and compared permanent teeth from 4,002 individuals found in 42 prehistoric and historic samples throughout [[East Asia]], Southeast Asia, Australia, and [[Melanesia]].&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt; Metric dental traits were denoted by [[Anatomical terms of location#Teeth|mesiodistal]] and buccolingual crown diameters.  Measurements were taken as maximum diameters and male individuals were primarily measured because males generally have larger teeth and therefore show more differences.  One culture that was prevalent during this time was the [[Đa Bút culture]] which occurred during 6000-5000 BP.&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt; The metric and nonmetric dental analyses of the Đa Bút resulted in one culture that are highly differentiated from the East Asians.  A cluster analysis of the transformed [[Probability plot correlation coefficient|Q-mode correlation coefficients]] of the dental crown measurements, showed a major cluster with Australo-Melanesians.  Da But also has similarities with Australo-Melanesians in tooth size proportions and nonmetric traits.&lt;ref name="matsu2" /&gt; These close traits indicates a likeness with Australo-Melanesians.

== Modern debates and controversies ==

The main controversy concerning the 'Two Layer' hypothesis is whether or not the evolutionary process truly involved the Australo-Melanesians. Archaeologists such as Matsumura suggest Southern Chinese people comprised the initial population of Southeast Asia, rather than Australo-Melanesians&lt;ref name="matsu1" /&gt; while researchers such as Turner argue that prehistoric Southeast Asians did not mix with either racial group.&lt;ref name="turner"&gt;Turner, C. (1992). The Dental Bridge between Australia and Asia: Following Macintosh into the East Asian Hearth of Humanity. Archaeology in Oceania, 27(3), 143-152.&lt;/ref&gt;
Though the early prehistoric Vietnamese and Malaysians both resembled the Australo-Melanesian samples the most, the [[Mán Bạc]] people had a greater resemblance to the [[Dong Son culture|Đông Sơn]] samples dating back to the [[Iron Age]]. Analyzing cranial and dental remains, Matsumura concluded based on chronological differences that the Mán Bạc people were immigrants affiliated with peoples near the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] region in Southern China.&lt;ref name="matsu1" /&gt; Molecular anthropologists have used classical genetic markers and [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] to analyze the similarities between early Chinese and Southeast Asians. Such genetic markers suggest the genetic layout of Southern Chinese peoples is quite similar to that of Southeast Asians.

Other controversies completely reject the 'Two Layer' hypothesis. Using dental evidence, Turner’s [[Sinodonty and Sundadonty|Sundadont/Sinodont]] hypothesis suggests the “Sundadont” trait seen in present-day Southeast Asians is a result of long-standing continuity. Turner created a cluster analysis of MMD values in order to test existing hypotheses of origins,&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt; concluding that all Southeast Asians, Micronesians, [[Polynesians]], and Jomonese form their own branch and descend from a common ancestor. The Australians and Melanesians, however, are scattered over the African and European branch along with a side branch of [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|Tasmanians]] and [[Solomon Islands#Early history|Solomon Islanders]]. Howell analyzed crania of major racial branches worldwide, and linked Australian and Melanesian cranial morphology most closely with African cranials. Howell discovered, however, that the size and features of present-day Asian cranial morphology differed significantly from that of Australians, Melanesians, and Africans.&lt;ref name="turner" /&gt;

'''William Barclay Squire''' (16 October 1855 – 13 January 1927) was a British musicologist, librarian and librettist.&lt;ref&gt;http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100526612&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
William Barclay Squire was a devoted music enthusiast. He spent 35 years of his life (1885-1920) working for the [[British Museum]], where he took charge of the collections of the music department and added many antiquarian publications to it. Squire prepared the publishing of the ''Catalogue of Printed Music before 1801'' (edited in 1912) and negotiated the deposit of the Royal Music Collection, for which he prepared the catalogue. He contributed numerous articles to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|Encyclopædia Britannica of 1911]], to the [[Dictionary of National Biography]] and to the [[The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Dictionary of Music and Musicians]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Author:William Barclay Squire]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Occasionally, Squire acted as a librettist. His main work was the [[libretto]] for ''The Veiled Prophet'', a Romantic Opera in 3 acts composed by [[Charles Villiers Stanford]], adapted from the homonymous ballad in [[Thomas Moore|Thomas Moore's]] oriental romance ''[[Lalla-Rookh|Lalla Rookh]]'', published 1890.&lt;ref&gt;https://urresearch.rochester.edu/institutionalPublicationPublicView.action;jsessionid=386750CF2E77AD967B345A05639F1EC2?institutionalItemVersionId=23447&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''zenith camera''' is an [[astrogeodetic]] telescope used today primarily for the local surveys of Earth's [[gravity field]]. Zenith cameras are designed as transportable field instruments for the direct observation of the [[plumb line]] (astronomical coordinates) and [[vertical deflection]]s.

A  zenith camera combines an optical lens (about 10–20&amp;nbsp;cm aperture) with a digital image sensor ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) in order to image stars near the zenith. Electronic levels (tilt sensors) serve as a means to point the lens towards zenith.
Zenith cameras are generally mounted on a turnable platform to allow star images to be taken in two camera directions (two-face-measurement). Because zenith cameras are usually designed as non-tracking and non-scanning instruments, exposure times are kept short, at the order of few 0.1 s, yielding rather circular star images. Exposure epochs are mostly recorded by means of the timing-capability of [[GPS]]-receivers (time-tagging).

== Data processing ==
Depending on the CCD sensor - lens combination used, few 10s to 100s of stars are captured with a single digital zenith image. The positions of imaged stars are measured by means of digital image processing algorithms, such as image moment analysis or point spread functions to fit the star images. Star catalogues, such as [[Tycho-2]] or [[UCAC]]-3 are used as celestial reference to reduce the star images. The zenith point is interpolated into the field of imaged stars, and corrected for the exposure time and (small) tilt of the telescope axis to yield the direction of the plumb line.

== Accuracy and applications ==
If the [[geodetic coordinates]] of the zenith camera is known or measured, e.g., with a [[GPS]]-receiver, vertical deflections are obtained as result of the zenith camera measurement. Zenith cameras deliver astronomical coordinates and vertical deflections accurate to about 0.1 seconds of arc. Zenith cameras with CCD image sensors are efficient to collect vertical deflections at about 10 field stations per night. Zenith cameras have been used for accurate local surveys of Earth's gravity field ([[geoid]], quasigeoid).
