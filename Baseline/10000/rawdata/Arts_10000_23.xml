'''African literature''' is [[literature]] of or from [[Africa]].

As George Joseph notes in his chapter on African literature in ''Understanding Contemporary Africa'', whereas European views of literature often stressed a separation of art and content, African awareness is inclusive:

:"Literature" can also simply mean an artistic use of words for the sake of art alone. [...]Traditionally, Africans do not radically separate art from teaching. Rather than write or sing for beauty in itself, African writers, taking their cue from oral literature, use beauty to help communicate important truths and information to society. Indeed, an object is considered beautiful because of the truths it reveals and the communities it helps to build.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph (1996), p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Precolonial literature ==
Examples of [[Precolonialism|pre-colonial]] African literature are numerous. In [[Ethiopia]], there is a substantial literature written in [[Ge'ez#History and literature|Ge'ez]] going back at least to the fourth century AD; the best-known work in this tradition is the ''[[Kebra Negast]]'', or "Book of Kings." One popular form of traditional African folktale is the "trickster" story, in which a small animal uses its wits to survive encounters with larger creatures. Examples of animal tricksters include [[Anansi]], a spider in the folklore of the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] people of [[Ghana]]; [[Ijàpá]], a [[tortoise]] in [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] folklore of [[Nigeria]]; and [[Sungura]], a [[hare]] found in central and East African folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=African Literature - MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555353/African_Literature.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDV5p8Q?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761555353/African_Literature.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=April 17, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other works in written form are abundant, namely in north Africa, the [[Sahel]] regions of west Africa and on the [[Swahili coast]]. From [[Timbuktu]] alone, there are an estimated 300,000 or more manuscripts tucked away in various libraries and private collections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sum.uio.no/research/mali/timbuktu/project/timanus.pdf |title=Timbuktu Manuscripts Project Description |work=uio.no |format=PDF |date=January 1, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505134134/http://www.sum.uio.no/research/mali/timbuktu/project/timanus.pdf |archivedate=May 5, 2006 |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; mostly written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] but some in the native languages (namely [[Fula language|Fula]] and [[Songhai languages|Songhai]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,569560,00.html |title=The Rush to Save Timbuktu's Crumbling Manuscripts |work=spiegel.de |date=August 1, 2008 |author=Matthias Schulz and Anwen Roberts |accessdate=April 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many were written at the famous [[University of Timbuktu]]. The material covers a wide array of topics, including astronomy, poetry, law, history, faith, politics, and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/mali/ |title=Ancient Manuscripts from the Desert Libraries of Timbuktu &amp;#124; Exhibitions - Library of Congress |publisher=Loc.gov |date=July 27, 2010 |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swahili literature]] similarly, draws inspiration from Islamic teachings but developed under indigenous circumstances. One of the most renowned and earliest pieces of Swahili literature being ''[[Utendi wa Tambuka]]'' or "The Story of Tambuka".

In Islamic times, North Africans such as [[Ibn Khaldun]] attained great distinction within [[Arabic literature]]. Medieval north Africa boasted universities such as those of [[Fes]] and [[Cairo]], with copious amounts of literature to supplement them.

== Colonial African literature ==
The African works best known in the West from the periods of colonization and the slave trade are primarily [[slave narratives]], such as [[Olaudah Equiano]]'s ''[[The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano]]'' ([[1789 in literature|1789]]).

In the colonial period, Africans exposed to Western languages began to write in those tongues. In [[1911 in literature|1911]], [[J. E. Casely Hayford|Joseph Ephraim Casely Hayford]] (also known as Ekra-Agiman) of the [[Gold Coast (Africa)|Gold Coast]] (now Ghana) published what is probably the first African novel written in English, ''[[Ethiopia Unbound|Ethiopia Unbound: Studies in Race Emancipation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Newell, ''Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: 'How to Play the Game of Life' '', Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 2002, p. 135, ch. 7, "Ethical Fiction: J.E. Casely Hayford's ''Ethiopia Unbound''".&lt;/ref&gt; Although the work moves between fiction and political advocacy, its publication and positive reviews in the Western press mark a watershed moment in African literature.

During this period, African [[Play (theatre)|plays]] written in English began to emerge. [[Herbert Isaac Ernest Dhlomo]] of [[South Africa]] published the first English-language African play, ''[[The Girl Who Killed to Save: Nongqawuse the Liberator]]'' in [[1935 in literature|1935]].  In [[1962 in literature|1962]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]] of [[Kenya]] wrote the first East African drama, ''[[The Black Hermit]]'', a cautionary tale about "[[tribalism]]" ([[discrimination]] between African tribes).

Among the first pieces of African literature to receive significant worldwide critical acclaim was ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', by [[Chinua Achebe]]. Published in 1958, late in the colonial era, ''Things Fall Apart'' analyzed the effect of colonialism on traditional African society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elizabeth |first=Marie |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2013/03/22/humble-beginnings-of-chinua-achebes-things-fall-apart/ |title=Humble beginnings of Chinua Achebe’s ‘Things Fall Apart’ |publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=March 22, 2013 |accessdate=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

African literature in the late colonial period (between the end of [[World War I]] and independence) increasingly showed themes of [[liberty|liberation]], independence, and (among Africans in French-controlled territories) [[négritude]].  One of the leaders of the négritude movement, the poet and eventual President of [[Senegal]], [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], published in [[1948 in literature|1948]] the first anthology of French-language poetry written by Africans, ''Anthologie de la nouvelle poésie nègre et malgache de langue française'' (''Anthology of the New Black and Malagasy Poetry in the French Language''), featuring a preface by the French [[existentialist]] writer [[Jean-Paul Sartre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Leopold Senghor - MSN Encarta&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761579258/Leopold_Senghor.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwDVhgpr?url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761579258/Leopold_Senghor.html |archivedate=October 31, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many writers this emphasis was not restricted to their publishing. Many, indeed, suffered deeply and directly: censured for casting aside his artistic responsibilities in order to participate actively in warfare, [[Christopher Okigbo]] was killed in battle for [[Biafra]] against the Nigerian movement of the 1960s' [[Nigerian Civil War|civil war]]; [[Mongane Wally Serote]] was detained under South Africa's [[Terrorism Act No 83 of 1967]] between 1969 and 1970, and subsequently released without ever having stood trial; in [[London]] in 1970, his countryman [[Arthur Norje]] committed suicide; [[Malawi]]'s [[Jack Mapanje]] was incarcerated with neither charge nor trial because of an off-hand remark at a university pub; and, in 1995, [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]] was hanged by the Nigerian junta.

== Postcolonial African literature ==
With liberation and increased literacy since most African nations gained their independence in the 1950s and 1960s, African literature has grown dramatically in quantity and in recognition, with numerous African works appearing in Western academic curricula and on "best of" lists compiled at the end of the 20th century.  African writers in this period wrote both in Western languages (notably [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) and in traditional African languages such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]].

[[Ali A. Mazrui]] and others mention seven conflicts as themes: the clash between Africa's past and present, between tradition and modernity, between indigenous and foreign, between individualism and community, between socialism and capitalism, between development and self-reliance and between Africanity and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ali A. Mazrui]] et al. "The development of modern literature since 1935" as ch. 19 of [[UNESCO]]'s ''[[General History of Africa]]'', vol. VIII, pp. 564f. Collaborating with Ali A. Mazrui on this chapter were [[Mario Pinto de Andrade]], M'hamed Alaoui Abdalaoui, Daniel P. Kunene and [[Jan Vansina]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other themes in this period include social problems such as corruption, the economic disparities in newly independent countries, and the rights and roles of women.  Female writers are today far better represented in published African literature than they were prior to independence.

In [[1986 in literature|1986]], [[Wole Soyinka]] became the first post-independence African writer to win the [[Nobel Prize]] in literature. Previously, [[Algeria]]n-born [[Albert Camus]] had been awarded the 1957 prize.

== Contemporary developments ==
There is a lot of literary production in [[Africa]] since the beginning of the current decade (2010), even though readers do not always follow in large numbers.&lt;ref&gt;"La littérature africaine est en mouvement" (African literature is on the move): [http://africultures.com/tribune-litterature-africaine-ne-manque-de-genies-de-critiques-14104/ Africultures.com]&lt;/ref&gt; One can also notice the appearance of certain writings that break with the [[academic]] style.&lt;ref&gt;This article compares the "rebellious" style of a young author (Eric Mendi) with the more classical style of Alain Mabanckou: [http://www.jeuneafrique.com/452019/culture/theorie-de-leau-de-javel-alain-mabanckou-eric-mendi/ Jeuneafrique.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the shortage of literary critics can be explored on the continent nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;African Literature: Between Genuises Affluence and Criticism Shortage: [http://www.camer.be/60400/11:1/belgique-african-literature-between-geniuses-affluence-and-criticism-shortage-belgium.html Camer.be]&lt;/ref&gt; Literary events seem to be very fashionable, including [[literary awards]], some of which can be distinguished by their original concepts. The case of the [[Grand Prix of Literary Associations]] is quite illustrative.&lt;ref&gt;This prize receives books in three languages (Spanish, English and French), the books are proposed to the Jury by literary associations: [https://www.bellanaija.com/2017/09/grand-prix-of-literary-associations-2017/ Bellanaija.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literature published in Africa ==
Inaugurated in 1980 and running till 2009, the [[Noma Award for Publishing in Africa]] was presented for the outstanding work of the year published in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Jay, [http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/abpr.2006.32.issue-2/abpr.2006.116/abpr.2006.116.xml "25 Years of the Noma Award for Publishing in Africa: an historic overview"], ''The African Book Publishing Record'', Volume 32, Issue 2, pp. 116–118, ISSN (Print) 0306-0322, DOI: 10.1515/ABPR.2006.116, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The project attempts to create a landmark for the city by including a cultural village, sports fields, memorial building, historical passageway, decorated gardens, amphitheater, circular yard, automobile museum, [[King Hussein Mosque]] and [[The Children's Museum Jordan]].&lt;ref name=park&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/english/project/p4.asp |title=Al Hussein Public Parks |accessdate=2008-08-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828204032/http://www.ammancity.gov.jo/english/project/p4.asp |archivedate=28 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Decorated Garden==
In the main attraction of Al Hussein Public Parks, a landscaped garden covers {{convert|70|acre|m2}} of a hillside. Sections of the garden include water elements, plants and trees, Mastabas of various heights, arbors, sand hills, gardens, and sites representing historical periods.&lt;ref name=park /&gt; Constructed by Engineering Universe for Building and Contracting, completed in 2006.

The Cultural Village is a square surrounded by Jordanian handicraft shops. The goal of it is to introduce Jordan's cultural heritage to Jordanians and visitors alike.&lt;ref name=park /&gt;

The park houses a mural constructed on a 488 meter wall displays Jordan's history from the origins of humans in the area to present times. Certain historical events mark each section. The mural was made using natural elements, such as marble, granite, iron, bronze, ceramic tile and pottery.&lt;ref name=park /&gt;

The Circular Yard is a decorated patio area or tile, sand, and grass that is mostly used for events and festivities.&lt;ref name=park /&gt;

Facilities for football, basketball, volleyball, and tennis are available in the sports area. Also in the area is a camping area and stone bleachers that can hold 150 spectators.&lt;ref name=park /&gt; Built by Engineering Universe for Building and Contracting.

A '''ballad''' {{IPAc-en|'|b|æ|l|ə|d}} is a form of verse, often a [[narrative]] set to [[music]]. Ballads derive from the medieval [[Music of France|French]] ''chanson balladée'' or ''[[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]]'', which were originally "danced songs". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later [[medieval]] period until the 19th century. They were widely used across [[Europe]], and later in [[Australia]], [[North Africa]], [[North America]] and [[South America]]. Ballads are often 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables. Another common form is ABAB or ABCB repeated, in alternating 8 and 6 syllable lines.

Many ballads were written and sold as single sheet [[Broadside (music)|broadsides]]. The form was often used by [[poet]]s and [[composer]]s from the 18th century onwards to produce lyrical ballads. In the later 19th century, the term took on the meaning of a slow form of popular [[love song]] and is often used for any love song, particularly the [[sentimental ballad]] of [[pop music|pop]] or [[rock music|rock]].

==Origins==
[[File:Here begynneth a gest of Robyn Hode.png|thumb|upright|A sixteenth-century printed ballad, the [[A Gest of Robyn Hode]]]]
The ballad derives its name from medieval [[French language|French]] dance songs or "ballares" ([[Latin|L]]: ''ballare'', to dance),&lt;ref&gt;W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (Harvard, 1944; 2nd edn., 1972), p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; from which 'ballet' is also derived, as did the alternative rival form that became the French [[Ballade (forme fixe)|ballade]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (1972, Penguin, 1976), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Apel, ''Harvard Dictionary of Music'' (1944, Harvard, 1972), pp. 70-72.&lt;/ref&gt; As a narrative song, their theme and function may originate from [[Scandinavia]]n and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] traditions of storytelling that can be seen in poems such as [[Beowulf]].&lt;ref name=Houseman1952&gt;J. E. Housman, ''British Popular Ballads'' (1952, London: Ayer Publishing, 1969), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Musically they were influenced by the [[Minnesinger]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Jacobs, ''A Short History of Western Music'' (Penguin 1972, 1976), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest example of a recognizable ballad in form in [[England]] is "[[Judas (ballad)|Judas]]" in a 13th-century [[manuscript]].&lt;ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"&gt;A. N. Bold, ''The Ballad'' (Routledge, 1979), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
This means that the two words, ballad and ballet, are both derived from the French language.

==Ballad form==
{{See also|AABA form}}
Ballads were originally written to accompany dances, and so were composed in couplets with refrains in alternate lines. These refrains would have been sung by the dancers in time with the dance.&lt;ref name="British Literature pg 610"&gt;"Popular Ballads", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; Most northern and west European ballads are written in [[ballad stanza]]s or [[quatrains]] (four-line [[stanzas]]) of alternating lines of [[Iamb (foot)|iambic]] (an unstressed followed by a stressed syllable) [[tetrameter]] (eight syllables) and iambic [[trimeter]] (six syllables), known as [[Common metre#Variants|ballad meter]]. Usually, only the second and fourth line of a quatrain are rhymed (in the scheme a, b, c, b), which has been taken to suggest that, originally, ballads consisted of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.&lt;ref name="I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66"&gt;D. Head and I. Ousby, ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in this stanza from "[[Lord Thomas and Fair Annet]]":

The '''horse''' | fair '''Ann''' | et '''rode''' | up'''on''' |&lt;br /&gt;
He '''amb''' | led '''like''' | the '''wind''' |,&lt;br /&gt;
With '''sil''' | ver '''he''' | was '''shod''' | be'''fore''',&lt;br /&gt;
With '''burn''' | ing '''gold''' | be'''hind''' |.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt;

There is considerable variation on this pattern in almost every respect, including length, number of lines and rhyming scheme, making the strict definition of a ballad extremely difficult. In southern and eastern Europe, and in countries that derive their tradition from them, ballad structure differs significantly, like Spanish ''romanceros'', which are [[octosyllabic]] and use [[Literary consonance|consonance]] rather than rhyme.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' ([[ABC-CLIO]], 1997), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballads usually are heavily influenced by the regions in which they originate and use the common dialect of the people. [[Scotland]]'s ballads in particular, both in theme and language, are strongly characterised by their distinctive tradition, even exhibiting some pre-Christian influences in the inclusion of supernatural elements such as travel to the [[Fairy]] Kingdom in the [[Scots language|Scots]] ballad "Tam Lin".&lt;ref&gt;"Popular Ballads" ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Restoration and the Eighteenth Century'', pp. 610-17.&lt;/ref&gt; The ballads do not have any known author or correct version; instead, having been passed down mainly by oral tradition since the Middle Ages, there are many variations of each. The ballads remained an oral tradition until the increased interest in folk songs in the 18th century led collectors such as [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Bishop Thomas Percy]] (1729–1811) to publish volumes of popular ballads.&lt;ref name="British Literature pg 610"/&gt;

In all traditions most ballads are narrative in nature, with a self-contained story, often concise, and rely on imagery, rather than description, which can be tragic, historical, romantic or comic.&lt;ref name="I. Ousby, 2006 p. 66"/&gt; Themes concerning rural laborers and their sexuality are common, and there are many ballads based on the Robin Hood legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/980|title=Songs of Protest, Songs of Love: Popular Ballads in Eighteenth-Century Britain {{!}} Reviews in History|website=www.history.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common feature of ballads is repetition, sometimes of fourth lines in succeeding stanzas, as a [[refrain]], sometimes of third and fourth lines of a stanza and sometimes of entire stanzas.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt;

==Composition==
[[File:Scott's Minstrelsy Of The Scottish Border.JPG|thumb|A copy of [[Walter Scott|Walter Scott's]] ''The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border''.]]
Scholars of ballads have been divided into "communalists", such as [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] (1744–1803) and the [[Brothers Grimm]], who argue that ballads are originally communal compositions, and "individualists" such as [[Cecil Sharp]], who assert that there was one single original author.&lt;ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"/&gt; Communalists tend to see more recent, particularly printed, broadside ballads of known authorship as a debased form of the genre, while individualists see variants as corruptions of an original text.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hawkins-Dady, ''Reader's Guide to Literature in English'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1996), p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently scholars have pointed to the interchange of oral and written forms of the ballad.&lt;ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission==
The transmission of ballads comprises a key stage in their re-composition. In romantic terms this process is often dramatized as a narrative of degeneration away from the pure 'folk memory' or 'immemorial tradition'.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Finnegan, ''Oral Poetry: Its Nature, Significance and Social Context'' (Cambridge University Press, 1977), p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction to ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]'' (1802) the romantic poet and historical novelist [[Walter Scott]] argued a need to 'remove obvious corruptions' in order to attempt to restore a supposed original. For Scott, the process of multiple recitations 'incurs the risk of impertinent interpolations from the conceit of one rehearser, unintelligible blunders from the stupidity of another, and omissions equally to be regretted, from the want of memory of a third.' Similarly, John Robert Moore noted 'a natural tendency to oblivescence'.&lt;ref&gt;"The Influence of transmission on the English Ballads", ''Modern Language Review'' 11 (1916), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scott, transcribed ballads often have a 'flatness and insipidity' compared to their oral counterparts.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Classification==
[[File:Illustration to the ballad Young Beckie from "Some British Ballads".jpg|right|thumb|Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]] to ''[[Young Bekie]].'']] European Ballads have been generally classified into three major groups: traditional, broadside and literary. In America a distinction is drawn between ballads that are versions of European, particularly British and Irish songs, and 'Native American ballads', developed without reference to earlier songs. A further development was the evolution of the blues ballad, which mixed the genre with Afro-American music. For the late 19th century the music publishing industry found a market for what are often termed sentimental ballads, and these are the origin of the modern use of the term 'ballad' to mean a slow love song.

===Traditional ballads===
{{See also|Child Ballads}}
The traditional, classical or popular (meaning of the people) ballad has been seen as beginning with the wandering [[minstrels]] of late medieval Europe.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt; From the end of the 15th century there are printed ballads that suggest a rich tradition of popular music. A reference in [[William Langland]]'s ''[[Piers Plowman]]'' indicates that ballads about [[Robin Hood]] were being sung from at least the late 14th century and the oldest detailed material is [[Wynkyn de Worde|Wynkyn de Worde's]] collection of Robin Hood ballads printed about 1495.&lt;ref name=Sweers2005&gt;B. Sweers, ''Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early collections of English ballads were made by [[Samuel Pepys]] (1633–1703) and in the [[Roxburghe Ballads]] collected by [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Robert Harley]], 1st (1784), which paralleled the work in Scotland by [[Walter Scott]] and [[Robert Burns]].&lt;ref name=Sweers2005/&gt; Inspired by his reading as a teenager of ''[[Reliques of Ancient English Poetry]]'' by [[Thomas Percy (bishop of Dromore)|Thomas Percy]], Scott began collecting ballads while he attended Edinburgh University in the 1790s. He published his research from 1802 to 1803 in a three-volume work, ''[[The Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border]]''. Burns collaborated with [[James Johnson (engraver)|James Johnson]] on the multi-volume ''[[Scots Musical Museum]]'', a miscellany of folk songs and poetry with original work by Burns. Around the same time, he worked with [[George Thomson (musician)|George Thompson]] on ''[[A Select Collection of Original Scottish Airs for the Voice]]''.&lt;ref name="Scott"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gregory|first=E. David |title=Victorian Songhunters: The Recovery and Editing of English Vernacular Ballads and Folk Lyrics, 1820-1883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B1tI8sPaqBwC&amp;pg=PA46|accessdate=August 30, 2017|date=April 13, 2006|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4616-7417-7|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Northern English and Southern Scots shared in the identified tradition of [[Border ballads]], particularly evinced by the cross-border narrative in versions of "[[The Ballad of Chevy Chase]]" sometimes associated with the Lancashire-born sixteenth-century minstrel [[Richard Sheale]].&lt;ref name="Gregory2006"&gt;D. Gregory, '"The Songs of the People for Me": The Victorian Rediscovery of Lancashire Vernacular Song', ''Canadian Folk Music/Musique folklorique canadienne'', 40 (2006), pp. 12-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the increasing interest in traditional popular ballads during the eighteenth century was prompted by social issues such as the enclosure movement as many of the ballads deal with themes concerning rural laborers.&lt;ref&gt;Robin Ganev,''Songs of Protest, Songs of Love: Popular Ballads in 18th Century Britain''&lt;/ref&gt; James Davey has suggested that the common themes of sailing and naval battles may also have prompted the use (at least in England) of popular ballads as naval recruitment tools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enterprise.gre.ac.uk/news/articles/2011/gmi-ballads-talk]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2014}}

Key work on the traditional ballad was undertaken in the late 19th century in Denmark by [[Svend Grundtvig]] and for England and Scotland by the Harvard professor [[Francis James Child]].&lt;ref name="N. Bold, 1979 p. 5"/&gt; They attempted to record and classify all the known ballads and variants in their chosen regions. Since Child died before writing a commentary on his work it is uncertain exactly how and why he differentiated the 305 ballads printed that would be published as ''[[The English and Scottish Popular Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;T. A. Green, ''Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Beliefs, Customs, Tales, Music, and Art'' (ABC-CLIO, 1997), p. 352.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been many different and contradictory attempts to classify traditional ballads by theme, but commonly identified types are the religious, supernatural, tragic, love ballads, historic, legendary and humorous.&lt;ref name=Houseman1952/&gt; The traditional form and content of the ballad were modified to form the basis for twenty-three bawdy pornographic ballads that appeared in the underground Victorian magazine ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880. Unlike the traditional ballad, these obscene ballads aggressively mocked sentimental nostalgia and local lore.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Joudrey, "Against Communal Nostalgia: Reconstructing Sociality in the Pornographic Ballad," ''Victorian Poetry'' 54.4 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadsides===
{{Main article|Broadside (music)}}
[[File:Tragical Ballad 18th century.png|right|thumb|An 18th-century broadside ballad: ''The tragical ballad: or, the lady who fell in love with her serving-man''.]]
Broadside ballads (also known as 'broadsheet', 'stall', 'vulgar' or 'come all ye' ballads) were a product of the development of cheap print in the 16th century. They were generally printed on one side of a medium to large sheet of poor quality paper. In the first half of the 17th century, they were printed in black-letter or gothic type and included multiple, eye-catching illustrations, a popular tune title, as well as an alluring poem.&lt;ref&gt;E. Nebeker, [http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/page/heyday-of-the-broadside-ballad "The Heyday of the Broadside Ballad"], ''English Broadside Ballad Archive, University of California-Santa Barbara'', retrieved 15 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 18th century, they were printed in white letter or roman type and often without much decoration (as well as tune title). These later sheets could include many individual songs, which would be cut apart and sold individually as "slip songs." Alternatively, they might be folded to make small cheap books or "chapbooks" which often drew on ballad stories.&lt;ref&gt;G. Newman and L. E.

Capp, 'Popular literature', in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Tessa Watt estimates the number of copies sold may have been in the millions.&lt;ref&gt;T. Watt, ''Cheap Print and Popular Piety, 1550-1640'' (Cambridge University Press, 1991), p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Many were sold by travelling [[chapmen]] in city streets or at fairs.&lt;ref&gt;M. Spufford, ''Small Books and Pleasant Histories: Popular Fiction and Its Readership in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Cambridge University Press, 1985), pp. 111-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The subject matter varied from what has been defined as the traditional ballad, although many traditional ballads were printed as broadsides. Among the topics were love, marriage, religion, drinking-songs, legends, and early journalism, which included disasters, political events and signs, wonders and prodigies.&lt;ref&gt;B. Capp, 'Popular literature', in B. Reay, ed., ''Popular Culture in Seventeenth-Century England'' (Routledge, 1985), p. 204.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary ballads===
Literary or lyrical ballads grew out of an increasing interest in the ballad form among social elites and intellectuals, particularly in the [[Romantic movement]] from the later 18th century. Respected literary figures [[Robert Burns]] and [[Walter Scott]] in Scotland collected and wrote their own ballads. Similarly in England [[William Wordsworth]] and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] produced a collection of ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'' in 1798 that included Coleridge's ''[[The Rime of the Ancient Mariner]]''. Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Keats were attracted to the simple and natural style of these folk ballads and tried to imitate it.&lt;ref&gt;"Popular Ballads", ''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature'', p. 610.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time in Germany [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] cooperated with [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] on a series of ballads, some of which were later set to music by [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]].&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Williams, ''The Life of Goethe'' (Blackwell Publishing, 2001), pp. 106-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Later important examples of the poetic form included Rudyard Kipling's "[[Barrack-Room Ballads]]" (1892-6) and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Ballad of Reading Gaol]]'' (1897).&lt;ref&gt;S. Ledger, S. McCracken, ''Cultural Politics at the Fin de Siècle'' (Cambridge University Press, 1995), p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt; Victorian poet [[Christina Rossetti]] used ballad forms to explore spiritual and moral issues and to discuss the stereotypical treatment and representation of men and women's roles in society.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

==Ballad operas==
{{Main article|Ballad opera}}
[[File:William Hogarth 016.jpg|thumb|200px|Painting based on ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', Act III Scene 2, [[William Hogarth]], c. 1728]]
In the 18th century ballad operas developed as a form of [[England|English]] [[stage play|stage entertainment]], partly in opposition to the Italian domination of the London operatic scene.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962) pp. 467-68.&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of racy and often [[Satire|satirical]] spoken (English) dialogue, interspersed with songs that are deliberately kept very short to minimize disruptions to the flow of the story. Rather than the more aristocratic themes and music of the Italian opera, the ballad operas were set to the music of popular folk songs and dealt with lower-class characters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/50485/ballad-opera "Ballad opera"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', retrieved 7 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Subject matter involved the lower, often criminal, orders, and typically showed a suspension (or inversion) of the high moral values of the Italian opera of the period. The first, most important and successful was ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' of 1728, with a libretto by [[John Gay]] and music arranged by [[John Christopher Pepusch]], both of whom probably influenced by [[Paris]] ian vaudeville and the burlesques and musical plays of [[Thomas d'Urfey]] (1653–1723), a number of whose collected ballads they used in their work.&lt;ref&gt;F. Kidson, ''The Beggar's Opera: Its Predecessors and Successors'' (Cambridge University Press, 1969), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Gay produced further works in this style, including a sequel under the title ''Polly''. [[Henry Fielding]], [[Colley Cibber]], Arne, Dibdin, Arnold, Shield, Jackson of Exeter, Hook and many others produced ballad operas that enjoyed great popularity.&lt;ref&gt;M. Lubbock, ''The Complete Book of Light Opera'' (New York: Appleton-Century-Crofts, 1962), pp. 467-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Ballad opera was attempted in America and Prussia. Later it moved into a more pastoral form, like [[Isaac Bickerstaffe|Isaac Bickerstaffe's]] ''Love in a Village'' (1763) and [[William Shield|Shield's]] ''Rosina'' (1781), using more original music that imitated, rather than reproduced, existing ballads. Although the form declined in popularity towards the end of the 18th century its influence can be seen in light operas like that of [[Gilbert and Sullivan|Gilbert and Sullivan's]] early works like ''[[The Sorcerer]]'' as well as in the modern musical.&lt;ref&gt;G. Wren, ''A Most Ingenious Paradox: The Art of Gilbert and Sullivan'' (Oxford University Press, 2006), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century, one of the most influential plays, [[Kurt Weill]] and [[Bertolt Brecht|Bertolt Brecht's]] (1928) ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' was a reworking of ''The Beggar's Opera'', setting a similar story with the same characters, and containing much of the same satirical bite, but only using one tune from the original.&lt;ref&gt;K. Lawrence, ''Decolonizing Tradition: New Views of Twentieth-century "British" Literary Canons'' (University of Illinois Press, 1992), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The term ballad opera has also been used to describe musicals using folk music, such as ''The Martins and the Coys'' in 1944, and [[Peter Bellamy|Peter Bellamy's]] ''The Transports'' in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Aby and P. Gruchow, ''The North Star State: A Minnesota History Reader'', (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2002), p. 461.&lt;/ref&gt; The satiric elements of ballad opera can be seen in some modern musicals such as ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]]'' and ''[[Cabaret (musical)|Cabaret]]''.&lt;ref&gt;L. Lehrman, ''Marc Blitzstein: A Bio-bibliography'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 568.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond Europe==

===Native American ballads===
[[File:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] outside the town of Talcott in [[Summers County, West Virginia]]]]
Native American ballads are ballads that are native to North America (not to be confused with ballads performed by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]).&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; Some 300 ballads sung in North America have been identified as having origins in British traditional or broadside ballads.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005&gt;N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), pp. 14-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include '[[The Streets of Laredo]]', which was found in Britain and Ireland as 'The Unfortunate Rake'; however, a further 400 have been identified as originating in North America, including among the best known, '[[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]]' and '[[Jesse James (folk song)|Jesse James]]'.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They became an increasing area of interest for scholars in the 19th century and most were recorded or catalogued by [[George Malcolm Laws]], although some have since been found to have British origins and additional songs have since been collected.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They are usually considered closest in form to British broadside ballads and in terms of style are largely indistinguishable, however, they demonstrate a particular concern with occupations, journalistic style and often lack the ribaldry of British broadside ballads.&lt;ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"/&gt;

===Blues ballads===
{{Main article|Blues ballad}}
The blues ballad has been seen as a fusion of Anglo-American and Afro-American styles of music from the 19th century. Blues ballads tend to deal with active protagonists, often anti-heroes, resisting adversity and authority, but frequently lacking a strong narrative and emphasising character instead.&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; They were often accompanied by banjo and guitar which followed [[the blues]] musical format.&lt;ref name="A. Green, 1997 p. 353"/&gt; The most famous blues ballads include those about [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and [[Casey Jones]].&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt;

===Bush ballads===
{{Main article|Bush ballad}}
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Cover to [[Banjo Paterson]]'s seminal 1905 collection of bush ballads, entitled ''The Old Bush Songs'']]
The ballad was taken to Australia by early settlers from Britain and Ireland and gained particular foothold in the rural [[outback]]. The rhyming songs, [[poems]] and tales written in the form of ballads often relate to the itinerant and rebellious spirit of Australia in [[The Bush]], and the authors and performers are often referred to as bush bards.&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"&gt;Kerry O'Brien December 10, 2003 7:30 Report, [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2003/s1007523.htm abc.net.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The 19th century was the golden age of bush ballads. Several collectors have catalogued the songs including [[John Meredith (folklorist)|John Meredith]] whose recording in the 1950s became the basis of the collection in the [[National Library of Australia]].&lt;ref name="abc.net.au"/&gt; The songs tell personal stories of life in the wide open country of Australia. Typical subjects include mining, raising and droving cattle, [[sheep shearing]], wanderings, war stories, the [[1891 Australian shearers' strike]], class conflicts between the landless working class and the [[Squatting (pastoral)|squatters]] (landowners), and outlaws such as [[Ned Kelly]], as well as love interests and more modern fare such as [[Truck driver|trucking]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Smith, ''Singing Australian: A History of Folk and Country Music'' (Pluto Press Australia, 2005), p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous bush ballad is "[[Waltzing Matilda]]", which has been called "the unofficial national anthem of Australia".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/epubs/waltzingmatilda/ Who'll come a waltzing Matilda with me?"], The National Library of Australia, retrieved 14 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sentimental ballads==
{{Main article|Sentimental ballad}}
Sentimental ballads, sometimes called "tear-jerkers" or "drawing-room ballads" owing to their popularity with the middle classes, had their origins in the early "[[Tin Pan Alley]]" music industry of the later 19th century. They were generally sentimental, narrative, strophic songs published separately or as part of an [[opera]] (descendants perhaps of [[broadside (music)|broadside ballads]], but with [[sheet music|printed music]], and usually newly composed). Such songs include "Little Rosewood Casket" (1870), "[[After the Ball (song)|After the Ball]]" (1892) and "[[Danny Boy]]".&lt;ref name=Cohen2005/&gt; The association with sentimentality led to the term "ballad" being used for slow [[love song]]s from the 1950s onwards. Modern variations include "[[jazz ballads]]", "[[pop ballads]]", "[[R&amp;B ballads]]" and "[[power ballads]]".&lt;ref name=Cohen2005p297&gt;N. Cohen, ''Folk Music: a Regional Exploration'' (Greenwood, 2005), p. 297.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3145">"'''Ballyscunnion'''" &lt;ref name="author"&gt;This Article by Mrs Bronte Matthews, daughter of Artist&lt;/ref&gt; was an imaginary village located in Ireland, depicted in 285 [[scratchboard|scraperboard]] cartoons by the illustrator, painter and comics artist [[William St. John Glenn R.U.A., Artist|William St. John Glenn RUA]]. The work was produced on white china scraperboard, painted with black ink and then scraped off  with a blade, to produce details.

William St John Glenn was born in 1904,&lt;ref name= "snoddy"&gt;Theo Snoddy, "Dictionary of 20th Century Irish Artists".&lt;/ref&gt; was described as an artist of warmth and gentle humour, and this was resent in "Ballyscunnion"&lt;ref name= "Sheridan"&gt;The Irish Times, Monday Dec 24th 1990, illustrated article by Kathy Sheridan.&lt;/ref&gt;as the village came to terms in its own way with the changing world. The work spanned over 30 years and, because the period detail was so accurate, it makes a unique pictorial history of social changes in rural Ireland.

The first reference  to "Ballyscunnion" appears in a "wash" drawing published in 1937 in Dublin Opinion - a humorous, pictorial magazine which appeared monthly as light relief from the turbulent period following the birth of the nation. Then from late 1938 "Ballyscunnion" appeared in scraperboard and continued this way until 1969, with a break from mid 1940 till 1946, due to illness and the war. 
In total there were 285 "Ballyscunnions" produced, some reappearing when Dublin Opinion produced a selection of their drawings in booklets and then again when the magazine released a series of three books, entitled  ''Fifteen Years of Dublin Opinion'', ''Thirty Years of Dublin Opinion'' and ''Forty Years of Dublin Opinion''.&lt;ref name= "Mac Dara"&gt;The Evening press, Friday 23rd Sept 1970. "Ballyscunnion, The village That's All In The Mind."&lt;/ref&gt;

An exhibition of "Ballyscunnion" drawings was held at the [[Irish Club]] in [[Eaton Square]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;The Chelsea News March 20th 1970. Photo of the Opening of the Ballyscunnion Exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was opened by [[Sir Charles Petrie]], a military historian and [[Charles E. Kelly (cartoonist)|Charles E. Kelly]], the former editor of the ''Dublin Opinion'', flew to the event from Ireland. Sir Charles suggested that the "Ballyscunnion" collection should be relocated to the [[National Gallery of Ireland|National Gallery]] in [[Dublin]], stating that "I am sure the likes of this will not be seen again."&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'' March 17, 1970. "Ballyscunnion in London", article within "An Irishman's Diary".&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ratpenat.svg|thumb|''Ratpenat'' (''the Crest of the Bat''), an heraldic symbol of the former [[Crown of Aragon]].]]
[[File:Coat of Arms of Teruel City.svg|thumb|Teruel city coat of arms.]]
The '''[[bat]]''' (also called the [[wikt:reremouse|reremouse]], [[wikt:reermouse|reermouse]], or [[wikt:rearmouse|rearmouse]]) as a [[heraldry|heraldic symbol]] is primarily represented in the coats of arms of certain important towns of the former [[Crown of Aragon]]. It appears mostly at the top, above the [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] over the shield.

==Origins==
The heraldic use of the bat in [[Valencia]], [[Catalonia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]] has its origins in a winged [[dragon]] or [[European dragon|Wyrm]] ([[European dragon#Dragons in Catalan mythology|''vibra'']] or ''víbria'') that was crowning the helmet or [[:ca:Cimera del Casal de Barcelona|''cimera reial'']] of the Kings of Aragon. Although traditionally the dragon helmet is ascribed to king [[James I of Aragon]] (1208 – 1276),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diariodemallorca.es/secciones/noticia.jsp?pRef=2009011100_4_425452__Diario-de-Palma-Vicisitudes-historicas-torno-cimera-Jaime Diario de Palma - ''Vicisitudes históricas en torno a la cimera de Jaime I'']&lt;/ref&gt;
reliable documents state that the winged dragon ''cimera reial'' didn't appear over the helmet until [[Peter IV of Aragon]]'s reign (1319 – 1387). 

There is also a legend that says that thanks to the humble intervention of a bat, king James I of Aragon was able to win a crucial battle against the [[Saracen]]s that allowed him to win Valencia for his kingdom. However, original documents state that the animal was a [[swallow]] and not a bat.&lt;ref name="cervantesvirtual.com"&gt;[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/FichaObra.html?Ref=23879&amp;portal=33 Luis Tramoyeres Blasco, ''Lo Rat Penat en el escudo de armas de Valencia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The bat in official heraldry==
The coats of arms of certain cities in eastern [[Spain]], like [[Valencia]],&lt;ref name="cervantesvirtual.com" /&gt; [[Palma, Mallorca]]&lt;ref&gt;Antoni I. Alomar i Canyelles, ''L'Estendard, la festa nacional més antiga d'Europa (s. XIII-XXI)'' Palma 1998&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fraga]]&lt;ref name="ifc.dpz.es"&gt;[http://ifc.dpz.es/recursos/publicaciones/25/75/_ebook.pdf Emblemata-Revista aragonesa de emblematica no. 11, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; have the bat over the shield. Also smaller towns, like [[Catarroja]] and [[Novallas]], use this symbol.

Formerly the [[Barcelona]] city coat of arms had a bat crowning it as well, but the bat was removed at the beginning of the 20th century for unknown reasons.&lt;ref&gt;L'escut de Barcelona, Societat Catalana de Genealogia, Heràldica, Sigil·lografia, Vexil·lologia i Nobiliària&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Teruel]]&lt;ref name="ifc.dpz.es" /&gt; used to have the bat surmounting the coat of arms' crown. There the bat represents a commemoration of the role of this city in the conquest of Valencia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aragonesasi.com/escudos/teescudo.php Old Teruel city coat of arms]&lt;/ref&gt; The bat now rests just below the crown in Teruel's seal.

While the use of the bat as a heraldic symbol is prevalent in the territories of the former Crown of Aragon it is rarely used elsewhere. However, it can be found in a few places, including in the coats of arms of the city of [[Albacete]] in Spain, the town of [[Montchauvet, Yvelines]] in [[France]], [[Fiefbergen]] in [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Germany]] and the former [[Borough of Brecknock]] and [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county]] of [[Brecknockshire]] in [[Wales]], [[UK]]. Outside of Europe, the coat of arms of [[Santa Fe de Antioquia]], [[Colombia]] includes multiple bats; it was granted to the town in 1545 by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Castile and Aragon]] and his mother, [[Joanna of Castile]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110707052728/http://www.reuna.unalmed.edu.co/temasdeinteres/Municipios/informacion.php?id=106&amp;opcion=simbolos REUNA - Municipio de Santa Fé de Antioquia]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
Based on the heraldic symbol of their city, certain Spanish [[association football]] club badges, like [[Albacete Balompié]], [[CD Alcoyano]], [[Levante UD]] and [[Valencia CF]], have a bat on them. The ancient badge of the [[FC Barcelona]], used during the 1899-1910 period, had a small bat crowning it as well.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tokyostage.haru.tv/viewvideo.php?c=&amp;vid=b6wsk_6L4oA&amp;f=gdata_videos&amp;artist=&amp;title=&amp;t2=&amp;a2=&amp;search=escut L'origen dels colors i l'escut del Barça]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Burgee]] of the Royal Valencia Yacht Club (Reial Club Nàutic de València) displays a bat on a golden field in its center.

[[Lo Rat Penat]], a political organization based in Valencia in 1878, was named after the heraldic bat. Established by [[Constantí Llombart]], Teodor Llorente and Fèlix Pizcueta, its aim was originally to foster a movement similar to the Catalan [[Renaixença]] in the region of Valencia.

The [[No. 9 Squadron RAF]] adopted the bat badge in 1917 along with the [[Latin]] motto ''Per Noctem Volamus'' "We fly through the night". The badge was approved by King [[Edward VIII]] in November 1936.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/h9.html |title=RAF Bomber command |access-date=2009-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206172950/http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/h9.html |archive-date=2008-12-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Bible case''' is a small, generally rectangular shaped bag, the primary purpose of which is to protect the owner's [[Bible]] from damage and also to allow the owner to easily identify their bible from others. They are made from a number of different materials, amongst the most popular being, [[leather]], [[denim]] and [[suede]]. Most are fastened with a [[Zipper|zip]] although some may use [[snap fastener]]s. The cases are generally only slightly larger than the bibles themselves and are therefore available in many different sizes.

It is not unusual to see decoration on bible cases such as pictures or bright colours. Some cases have handles on them in a similar style to [[briefcase]]s. Further personalisation can be made by adding the owners name or a bible quote. Many cases have several compartments or zipped sections in which to store useful items that are bible related such a [[hymn|hymn book]], [[note pad]] or [[pen]].

The historical forebear of the bible case is the [[bible box]], which is still in use although on a smaller scale than bible cases. The advantage of the case is that it is cheaper and more portable, whilst boxes offer more protection and lessen the chance of bibles, especially more expensive ones, being lost.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8128">'''Bottled Ocean''' was an exhibition of work by New Zealand artists of Pacific Island descent that was shown at a number of metropolitan art galleries in New Zealand in 1994-1995. It featured the work artists who have become notable figures in New Zealand and internationally.

==Curatorial intent==

Jim Vivieaere, a New Zealand artist of Rarotongan descent, was commissioned by touring exhibition company Exhibitour to curate an exhibition of contemporary Pacific Island artists. [[City Gallery Wellington]] was a partner in the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bottled Ocean|url=http://citygallery.org.nz/exhibitions/bottled-ocean|website=City Gallery Wellington|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Te Ara'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mahina-Tuai|first1=Kolokesa Uafa|title=Pacific arts in New Zealand - Visual art and literature'|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/photograph/44240/bottled-ocean-1994|website=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=16 June 2015|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition was not a straightforward survey or 'celebration' of Pacific artists. Organising the exhibition turned Vivieaere into a spokesperson or authority on Pacific Island art, a position he was uneasy with.&lt;ref name ='Paradise'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chiu|first1=Melissa|last2=Stevenson|first2=Karen|last3=Mason|first3=Ngahiraka|last4=Vercoe|first4=Caroline|title=Paradise now? : contemporary art from the Pacific|date=2004|publisher=David Bateman in association with Asia Society|location=Auckland|isbn=1869535847}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|26}} He was concerned that the exhibition could lead to artists being pigeon-holed or 'ghettoised' or that stereotypes of the 'exotic' Pacific could be reinforced.&lt;ref name ='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|26–27}} In one interview Vivieaere said that the ‘only reason we are here is that we are Polynesian – not on our merits but because we’re the "other"…. We don’t need Polynesian shows. I would like to see it as the last.’&lt;ref name ='Te Ara'/&gt;

==Artists==

Vivieaere selected a broad range of artists who worked in a variety of media and were at different stages of their careers.&lt;ref name='Te Ara'/&gt; Most of them were born in New Zealand but had ties to [[Samoa]], [[Niue]], the [[Cook Islands]] and [[Tonga]].&lt;ref name ='Mallon'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mallon|first1=Sean|last2=Pereira|first2=Pandora Fulimalo|title=Speaking in colour : conversations with artists of Pacific Island heritage|date=1997|publisher=Te Papa Press|location=Wellington|isbn=0909010447}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|36}}

Twenty-three artists formed the core exhibition:

*[[Fatu Feu'u]]
*William Furneaux
*Patriq Futialo
*Bruce George
*[[Niki Hastings-McFall]]
*[[Ioane Ioane]]
*[[Lily Laita]]
*Iosefa Leo
*Simmie Nichols
*Johnny Peninsula
*Lyle Peninsula
*Laugutu Poloai
*[[John Pule]]
*[[Ani O'Neill]]
*Albert Refiti
*Toegamau Tom Sefo
*Greg Semu
*Tania Short
*[[Sopolemalama Filipe Tohi|Filipe Tohi]]
*[[Michel Tuffery]]
*Lape Fakalaga Tulisi
*Veronica Vaevae
*Loretta Young

As the exhibition progressed other artists were added including Evotia Tamu, Sheyne Tuffery, Luana Asiata, Sasha Kronfeld, Glenda Vilisoni, Sale Jessop and the musical group Grace (made up of brothers Anthony, Jason and Paul Ioasa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grace - profile|url=http://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/grace|website=AudioCulture|accessdate=16 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==

''Bottled Ocean'' launched at City Gallery Wellington in 1994 and toured to [[Auckland Art Gallery]], Waikato Art Gallery (now [[Waikato Museum]]), the Manawatu Art Gallery (now [[Te Manawa]]) and the McDougall Art Annex (now [[Christchurch Art Gallery]]) throughout 1994 and 1995.&lt;ref name='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|33}}

Vivieaere changed the display of the exhibition for each location. At City Gallery Wellington the works were displayed on a mirrored floor behind a perspex wall, mimicking museum cabinets or shop window displays. and creating a forced distance between the art and the viewer.&lt;ref name ='Mallon'/&gt;{{Rp|136}} At the Auckland Art Gallery a mirrored floor was used and some of the works remained in their travelling crates or were partly unpacked.&lt;ref name='Te Ara'/&gt; At the Robert McDougall Art Annex Michel Tuffery's sculpture ''Pisupo Lua Afe'', a life-size bull made out of flattened corned-beef cans, was positioned as if it was gazing at a wall of art works like a visitor.&lt;ref name='Paradise'/&gt;{{Rp|26}}

==Reception and influence==

''Bottled Ocean'' has been noted for being one of the first exhibitions to focus on contemporary Pacific artists and for its underlying concerns. The exhibition was discussed at length in the publication accompanying ''Paradise Now: Contemporary Art from the Pacific'', the first major exhibition of contemporary Pacific art to show in a United States museum. It is also discussed in the recent book ''Art in Oceania: A New History'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Bottled Ocean'' made the 'arrival' of contemporary Pacific art in the elite galleries of the New Zealand art world a problem to be reflected upon, rather than simply a triumph to celebrate. Having been invited to survey the work of Pacific migrants, Vivieaere turned the exhibition into something of an installation, a work of art in its own right, in which he used various exhibitionary devices to make the desire for 'cultural difference' and 'otherness', which had become broadly topical in the artworld, the implicit subject of the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brunt|first1=Peter|last2=Nicholas|first2=Thomas|title=Art in Oceania : a new history|date=2013|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=London|isbn=0500239010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|432}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewing the exhibition for ''Art AsiaPacific'' Wendy Vaigro wrote

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the ostensible organising principle of ''Bottled Ocean'', 'Pacific Islandness' is utilised as a term that references, ironically, attempts to homogenise Polynesian artists working in New Zealand. ... In challenging the closure of aesthetic and political categories and conventional curatorial practices, Jim Vivieaere creates ''Bottled Ocean'' as a meta-exhibition. The result is a subtle and thoughtful show that eludes ideological control and authoritative discourse at every turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vaigro|first1=Wendy|title=''Bottled Ocean": Shape Shifting|journal=Art AsiaPacific|date=1995|volume=2|issue=4|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a review for ''Art New Zealand'', [[Nicholas Thomas]] investigated Vivieaere's reference to a 'modern tribal art market' in the brochure accompanying the exhibition.&lt;ref name=Thomas&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Nicholas|title=Pacific Dualities: Bottled Ocean in Wellington and Auckland|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 1995|issue=74|pages=46–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; He observed that 'the work in ''Bottled Ocean'' is produced for and around a market - not just an art market, but a contemporary global cultural market, a multicultural theatre in which identities, signatures, nationalities and lifestyles are affirmed, celebrated, changed and consumed.'.&lt;ref name ='Thomas'/&gt;{{Rp|46}} He continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The mainstream audience may be primarily interested in the tropical colourfulness of the work, in the apparent conformity of its spirituality with New Age environmentalism, in its exoticism. Artists appear to have responded to this interest by making exoticism visually explicit through the use of readily recognizable Polynesian motifs. ... The distinctive accomplishment of ''Bottled Ocean'' lies in its direct but subtle challenge to this consumerist interest interest in Pacific art and culture.&lt;ref name ='Thomas'/&gt;{{Rp|47–48}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Clara the rhinoceros''' (?1738-14 April 1758) was a female [[Indian rhinoceros]] who became famous during 17 years of [[Grand Tour|touring Europe]] in the mid-18th century. She arrived in [[Europe]] in [[Rotterdam]] in 1741, becoming the fifth living rhinoceros to be seen in Europe in modern times since [[Dürer's Rhinoceros]] in 1515. After tours through towns in the [[Dutch Republic]], the [[Holy Roman Empire]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], [[France]], the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]], the [[Papal States]], [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] and [[Denmark]], she died in [[Lambeth]], England.

==Life==
In 1738, aged approximately one month, Clara was adopted by [[Jan Albert Sichterman]] in India after her mother was killed by Indian hunters. Sichterman was the director of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie'' or VOC) in [[Bengal]]. She became quite tame, and was allowed to move freely around his residence. In 1740, Sichterman either sold or gave her as a gift to [[Douwe Mout van der Meer]], captain of the ''Knappenhof'', who returned to the [[Netherlands]] with Clara.&lt;ref name = "Van der Pol"&gt;{{cite book|last1=van der Pol|first1=Bauke|title=THe Dutch East India Company in India|publisher=Parragon Books Ltd|isbn=978-1-4723-7605-3|page=67.68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Van der Meer would become Clara's agent and companion until her death.

Clara disembarked at Rotterdam on 22 July 1741 and was immediately exhibited to the public. Clara was exhibited in [[Antwerp]] and [[Brussels]] in 1743 and in [[Hamburg]] in 1744. The exhibitions were so successful that Douwe Mout van der Meer left the VOC in 1744 to tour Europe with his rhinoceros. He had a special wooden carriage built to convey her, and her skin was kept moist with [[fish oil]].  The tour started in earnest in spring 1746, and proved to be an outstanding success. Clara visited [[Hanover]] and [[Berlin]], where King [[Frederick II of Prussia]] saw her on 26 April in [[Spittelmarkt]]. The tour continued to [[Frankfurt an der Oder]], [[Breslau]], and [[Vienna]], where Emperor [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]] and Empress [[Maria-Theresa]] saw her on 5 November.

[[Image:Clara 1747.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Example of the mass-produced souvenir pictures of Clara sold by Douwe Mout van der Meer; this example from her stay at the Gasthof "Zum Pfau" in [[Mannheim]] in November 1747.]]

In 1747, she travelled to [[Regensburg]], [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]] and [[Dresden]], where she posed for [[Johann Joachim Kaendler]] from the [[Meissen porcelain]] factory and was visited on 19 April by [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], [[Elector of Saxony]] and [[King of Poland]]. She was in [[Leipzig]] on 23 April for Easter, and visited the [[orangery]] of the castle of [[Kassel]] at the invitation of [[Frederick II, Landgrave of Hesse]]. In November she visited the "Gasthof zum Pfau" ''(The Peacock Inn)'' in [[Mannheim]], and she was in [[Strasbourg]] in December for Christmas.

In 1748, she visited [[Bern]], [[Zürich]], [[Basel]], [[Schaffhausen]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Würzburg]]. She returned to [[Leiden]] and visited [[France]]. She was in [[Reims]] in December 1748, and was received by King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] in January 1749 at the royal [[menagerie]] in [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]. She spent 5 months in [[Paris]], creating a sensation: letters, poems, and songs were written about her, and wigs were created ''à la rhinocéros''. Clara was examined by the naturalist [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon|Buffon]], [[Jean-Baptiste Oudry]] painted a life-size portrait of her, and she inspired the French Navy to name a vessel ''Rhinocéros'' in 1751.  A drawing based on Oudry's painting appeared in [[Diderot]] and [[D'Alembert]]'s ''[[Encyclopédie]]'', and Buffon's ''Histoire naturelle, générale et particulière''.

At the end of 1749, Clara embarked at [[Marseille]]s to travel to [[Italy]]. Avoiding the fate of Dürer's Rhinoceros, which drowned in a shipwreck off the [[Liguria]]n coast near [[Porto Venere]] in 1516, Clara visited [[Naples]] and [[Rome]]. In March 1750, she visited the [[Baths of Diocletian]].  She seems to have rubbed off her horn while in Rome (a common problem for rhinoceroses kept in close confinement, although some reports claim that her horn was cut off in Rome for reasons of safety). A new horn eventually grew in.

She passed through [[Bologna]] in August and [[Milan]] in October.  She arrived in [[Venice]] in January 1751, where she became a major attraction at the [[carnival]] and was painted by [[Pietro Longhi]]. She passed through [[Verona]] on the way back to Vienna. She had reached London by the end of the year, where she was viewed by the British royal family.

Little is known of her exact movements from 1752 to 1758, but she visited [[Prague]]; then [[Warsaw]], [[Kraków]], [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] and [[Breslau]] (a second time) in 1754; and [[Copenhagen]] in 1755.  She returned to London in 1758, where she was exhibited at the ''Horse and Groom'' in [[Lambeth]], with entry prices of sixpence and one shilling. This was where she died on 14 April, aged about 20.

==Honors and recolonizations==
In 1991, the [[Natural History Museum Rotterdam|Natuurhistorisch Museum in Rotterdam]] held an exhibition on Clara. In 2008 the Clara Memorial was created at the same museum to mark the 250th death anniversary of the rhinoceros.&lt;ref name = "Van der Pol"/&gt;

[[File:Boutet 1708 color circles.jpg|right|thumb|Boutet's 7-colour and 12-color color circles from 1708]]
[[File:Bezold Farbentafel 1874.jpg|right|thumb|Wilhelm von Bezold's 1874 ''Farbentafel'']]

A '''color wheel''' or '''colour circle'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory|title=Basic Color Theory|website=Color Matters|last=Morton|first=J.L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an abstract illustrative organization of [[color]] [[hue]]s around a circle, which shows the relationships between [[primary color]]s, [[secondary color]]s, tertiary colors etc.

Some sources use the terms ''color wheel'' and ''color circle'' interchangeably;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Artist's Color Manual: The Complete Guide to Working With Color | author = Simon Jennings | publisher = Chronicle Books | year = 2003 | isbn = 0-8118-4143-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yz8q9RV05uYC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=color-wheel+color-circle#PPA26,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Color Dimensions: Creating New Principles of Color Harmony and a Practical Equation in Color Definition | author = Faber Birren |authorlink=Faber Birren | publisher = Chicago: The Crimson Press | year = 1934 | isbn = 1-4286-5179-9 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ucTfVJnO-64C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=inauthor:birren+inauthor:faber+color-wheel+color-circle#PPA18,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, one term or the other may be more prevalent in certain fields or certain versions as mentioned above.  For instance, some reserve the term ''color wheel'' for mechanical rotating devices, such as color tops or filter wheels.  Others classify various color wheels as ''color disc'', ''color chart'', and ''color scale'' varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Elements of Natural Philosophy: For the Use of Schools and Academies | author = Joseph Anthony Gillet and William James Rolfe | year = 1881 | publisher = New York: Potter, Ainsworth | url = https://books.google.com/?id=8jYAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=color-disc#PPA186,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an illustrative model, artists typically use [[red]], [[yellow]], and [[blue]] primaries ([[RYB color model]]) arranged at three equally spaced points around their color wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Oil Painting Course You've Always Wanted: Guided Lessons for Beginners | author = Kathleen Lochen Staiger | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=B4Q05KmkEdUC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=color-wheel+artist+red+yellow+blue| isbn = 0-8230-3259-0 | year = 2006 | publisher = Watson–Guptill }}&lt;/ref&gt; Printers and others who use modern subtractive color methods and terminology use [[magenta]], [[yellow]], and [[cyan]] as [[subtractive primaries]].

== Colors of the color wheel ==
[[File:RGV color wheel 1908.png|right|thumb|A 1908 color wheel with red, green, and violet "plus colors" and magenta, yellow, and cyan blue "minus colors"]]

The typical artists' paint or pigment color wheel includes the blue, red, and yellow [[primary color]]s. The corresponding [[secondary color]]s are green, orange, and violet or purple. The [[tertiary color]]s are green-yellow, yellow–orange, orange-red, red–violet/purple, purple/violet-blue and blue–green.

A color wheel based on [[RGB]] (red, green, blue) or RGV (red, green, violet) additive primaries has cyan, magenta, and yellow secondaries ([[cyan]] was previously known as cyan blue).  Alternatively, the same arrangement of colors around a circle can be described as based on cyan, magenta, and yellow subtractive primaries, with red, green, and blue (or violet) being secondaries.

Most color wheels are based on three primary colors, three secondary colors, and the six intermediates formed by mixing a primary with a secondary, known as tertiary colors, for a total of 12 main divisions; some add more intermediates, for 24 named colors.  Other color wheels, however, are based on the four [[opponent process|opponent]] colors, and may have four or eight main colors.

[[Goethe]]'s [[Theory of Colours]] provided the first systematic study of the physiological effects of color (1810). His observations on the effect of opposed colors led him to a symmetric arrangement of his color wheel anticipating [[Ewald Hering]]'s [[Opponent process|opponent color theory]] (1872).{{quote|text=...for the colours diametrically opposed to each other... are those that reciprocally evoke each other in the eye. |author=Goethe|title=[[Theory of Colours]]}}

==The color circle and color vision==
[[File:Opponent color circle 1917.png|right|thumb|A 1917 four-way color circle related to the color [[opponent process]]]]

A color circle based on spectral wavelengths appears with [[red]] at one end of the spectrum and is 100% mixable [[Violet (color)|violet]] at the other. A wedge-shaped gap represents colors that have no unique spectral frequency. These extra-spectral colors, the [[purple]]s, form from additive mixture of colors from the ends of the spectrum.

In normal human vision, wavelengths of between about 400&amp;nbsp;nm and 700&amp;nbsp;nm are represented by this incomplete circle, with the longer wavelengths equating to the red end of the spectrum.  Complement colors are located directly opposite each other on this wheel.  These complement colors are not identical to colors in pigment mixing (such as are used in paint), but when lights are additively mixed in the correct proportions appear as a neutral grey or white.&lt;ref name="complements"&gt;Krech, D., Crutchfield, R.S., Livson, N., Wilson, W.A. jr., Parducci, A. (1982) ''Elements of psychology'' (4th ed.). New York: Alfred A. Knopf. pp. 108-109.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example: the reason that the [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon tennis tournament]] uses purple on the Wimbledon official logo is that purple is located almost opposite of green on the color wheel. Purple against green provides good contrast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Court Colors Give Way to a Kaleidoscope of Shades|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/26/sports/tennis/french-open-courts-of-many-colors-in-tennis-world.html?_r=0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color circle is used for, among other purposes, illustrating [[additive color]] mixture. Combining two colored lights from different parts of the spectrum may produce a third color that appears like a light from another part of the spectrum, even though dissimilar wavelengths are involved. This type of color matching is known as [[Metamerism (color)|metameric]] matching.&lt;ref name="Schiffman"/&gt;  Thus a combination of green and red light might produce a color close to yellow in apparent hue. The newly formed color lies between the two original colors on the color circle, but they are usually represented as being joined by a straight line on the circle, the location of the new color closer to the (white) centre of the circle indicating that the resulting hue is less saturated (i.e., paler) than either of the two source colors. The combination of any two colors in this way are always less saturated than the two pure spectral colors individually.

Objects may be viewed under a variety of different lighting conditions. The human visual system is able to adapt to these differences by [[chromatic adaptation]]. This aspect of the visual system is relatively easy to mislead, and optical illusions relating to color are therefore a common phenomenon. The color circle is a useful tool for examining these illusions.

Arranging spectral colors in a circle to predict admixture of light stems from work by Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. Newton's calculation of the resulting color involves three steps: First, mark on the color circle the constituent colors according to their relative weight. Second, find the [[barycenter]] of these differently weighted colors. Third, interpret the radial distance (from the center of the circle to the barycenter) as the saturation of the color, and the azimuthal position on the circle as the hue of the color. Thus, Newton's color circle is a predecessor of the modern, horseshoe-shaped [[CIE 1931 color space|CIE color diagram.]]

The psychophysical theory behind the color circle dates to the early [[color triangle]] of [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]], whose work was later extended by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Hermann von Helmholtz]].  Young postulated that the eye contains receptors that respond to three different primary sensations, or spectra of light.  As Maxwell showed, all hues, but not all colors, can be created from three [[primary color]]s such as red, green, and blue, if they are mixed in the right proportions.

==Color wheels and paint color mixing==
There is no straight-line relationship between colors mixed in pigment, which vary from medium to medium.  With a psychophysical color circle, however, the resulting hue of any mixture of two colored light sources can be determined simply by the relative brightness and wavelength of the two lights.&lt;ref name="Schiffman"&gt;Schiffman, H.R. (1990) Sensation and perception: An integrated approach (3rd ed.). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 252-253.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar calculation cannot be performed with two paints. As such, a painter's color wheel is indicative rather than predictive, being used to compare existing colors rather than calculate exact colors of mixtures. Because of differences relating to the medium, different color wheels can be created according to the type of paint or other medium used, and many artists make their own individual color wheels. These often contain only blocks of color rather than the gradation between tones that is characteristic of the color circle.&lt;ref name="paint"&gt;Rodwell, J. (1987) The complete watercolour artist. London: Paul Press, pp. 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color wheel software==
{{Main|Color tool}}

A number of interactive color wheel applications are available both on the Internet and as desktop applications. These programs are used by artists and designers for picking colors for a design.

== HSV color wheel ==
[[File:Hsv color circle.svg|thumb|right|A color wheel based on [[HSL and HSV|HSV]], labeled with HTML color keywords]]

The [[HSL and HSV]] color spaces are simple geometric transformations of the [[RGB color space|RGB]] cube into cylindrical form. The outer top circle of the HSV cylinder – or the outer middle circle of the HSL cylinder – can be thought of as a color wheel. There is no authoritative way of labeling the colors in such a color wheel, but the six colors which fall at corners of the RGB cube are given names in the [[X11 color names|X11 color list]], and are [[web colors#HTML color names|named keywords in HTML]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#h-6.5|title=Basic HTML data types|publisher=[[W3C]]|work=HTML 4.01 Specification|date=24 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Color schemes==
{{Main|Color scheme}}

Color schemes are logical combinations of colors on the color wheel.

[[File:Moses Harris, The Natural System of Colours.jpg|thumb|Moses Harris, in his book ''The Natural System of Colours'' (1776), presented this color palette.  Complementary colors are two colors directly across from each other; for example, red and green are complementary colors. Tetradic color palettes use four colors, a pair of complementary color pairs. For example, one could use yellow, purple, red, and green. Tetrad colors can be found by putting a square or rectangle on the color wheel.]]

In [[color theory]], a [[color scheme]] is the choice of colors used in design for a range of media. For example, the use of a white background with black text is an example of a common default color scheme in web design.

Color schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an aesthetic feeling together commonly appear together in color schemes. A basic color scheme uses two colors that look appealing together. More advanced color schemes involve several colors in combination, usually based around a single color&amp;mdash;for example, text with such colors as red, yellow, orange and light blue arranged together on a black background in a magazine article.

[[File:020 schiffermueller1.jpg|thumb|Ignaz Schiffermüller, Versuch eines Farbensystems (Vienna, 1772), plate I. Color wheels can be used to create pleasing color schemes. An analogous color scheme is made up of colors next to each other on the wheel. For example, red, orange, and yellow are analogous colors.]]

Color schemes can also contain different shades of a single color; for example, a color scheme that mixes different shades of green, ranging from very light (almost white) to very dark.

Analogous colors are colors next to each other on the wheel. For example, yellow and green.
Monochromic colors are different shades of the same color. For example, light blue, indigo, and cyan blue.
Complementary colors are colors across from each other on a color wheel. For example, blue and orange.
Triadic colors are colors that are evenly across from each other, in a triangle over the color wheel. For example, the primary colors red, yellow, and blue are triadic colors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://burnettsboards.com/2013/05/how-to-create-color-palettes/ How to create color palettes]&lt;/ref&gt;

For a list of ways to construct color schemes, regarding properties such as warmness/achromiticness/complementariness, see [[color theory]].

Analogous color schemes use colors that are next to each other on the color wheel. They usually match well and create serene and comfortable designs. Analogous color schemes are often found in nature and are harmonious and pleasing to the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=del rosario |first1=Sivy |url=http://www.tigercolor.com/color-lab/color-theory/color-harmonies.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Coronation of the Virgin''''' is a painting by [[Diego Velázquez]] of the [[Coronation of the Virgin|Holy Trinity crowning the Blessed Virgin Mary]], a theme in [[Marian art]]. It is now at the [[Museo del Prado]].

It was probably commissioned for the oratory of the court of [[Elisabeth of France (1602–1644)|Elisabeth of France]], queen consort to [[Philip IV of Spain]], in the [[Real Alcázar of Madrid]]. There it joined others on [[Virgin Mary|Marian]] religious festivities by the [[Naples]] painter [[Andrea Vaccaro]] which had been brought to Madrid by cardinal [[Gaspar de Borja y Velasco]]. The model for Mary in the work may be the same model as the artist used for the ''[[Rokeby Venus]]''.

== Description ==
Velázquez's coronation of the Virgin is exceptional for being a rare religious work by an artist better known for his portraits, and for the air of naturalness and simplicity not found in works by other Baroque religious painters. Its composition is based on an inverted triangle, giving a sense of great equilibrium and harmonious lines and reminiscent (both in its colour and form) of a heart. The main figure is the Virgin Mary, with a modest, reverential, and emotional expression, lowered eyes, a straight nose and curved lips. The sense that the inverted triangle is meant to refer to a heart is reinforced and the viewer's piety invoked by Mary pointing to her own heart.

To the viewer's right is God the Father, represented as a dignified old man, whilst to the left is the long-haired figure of Jesus Christ - together they hold Mary's crown above her head. In the centre the [[Holy Spirit]] is represented in the form of a white dove. The two figures' heads and the dove are all level, on the line of the triangle's base, representing their equality within the [[Holy Trinity]]. Also notable are the [[cherub]]s round the Virgin at the base of the painting - their pictorial quality rivals that of [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo|Murillo]], famous for his cherub-themed works.

The colours Velázquez uses are blues and violets. He also used [[carmine]]s (especially Venetian carmine) instead of traditional reds, following the advice of his tutor Pacheco as written down in his book ''Arte de la Pintura'', despite Velázquez already being an acclaimed artist and well beyond his student years by the time of producing this painting.

'''''English Botany''''' was a major publication of British plants comprising a 36 volume set, issued in 267 monthly parts over 23 years from 1791 to 1814. The work was conceived, illustrated, edited and published by the botanical illustrator and natural historian, [[James Sowerby]]. The brief, but formal descriptions were mostly supplied by the founder of the [[Linnean Society]], [[Sir James Edward Smith]]. Initially Smith declined to have his name associated with the work as he considered his professional co-operation with a mere artisan such a Sowerby might degrade his standing in higher circles. However, following the phenomenal public success and general acceptance by the professional class of the work he insisted that the title page of the fourth and succeeding volumes include his name. The work, however, continued to be generally referred to as "'''''Sowerby's Botany'''''".

The full title reads; ''English Botany or, Coloured Figures of British Plants, with their Essential Characters, Synonyms and Places of Growth''. The complete work comprises 2,592 hand-coloured, copper-plate engravings, including 3 fold-outs, each with a single page of text. The work is comprehensively indexed with each of the 36 volumes having its own specific set. In September 1814, Sowerby published a comprehensive, 42 page, three-part final index comprising; two indexes with Latin nomenclature (systematical and alphabetical) and an index of the common English names. The final indexes were also sold to non-subscribers as a set that included a six page index to Sowerby's concurrent work ''"Coloured Figures of English Fungi or Mushrooms"'' (1797-1809 with five supplements to 1814) - the supplements not having previously been indexed.

While extensive, the work was not initially intended to be comprehensive; Smith would be the first to set out do such a survey with his first two volumes of ''[[Flora Britannica]]''. However, by the end of the work it had become the most comprehensive, illustrated flora of Great Britain published up to that time. It included the first descriptions and illustrations of many mosses and lichens, a particular passion of both Sowerby and Smith.
  
The descriptions given are accurate and systematic, in the use of [[binomial nomenclature]], with Latin and English description; but a wider audience was intended with digression into general discussion and cultivation. Combined with increased sales of books, and the amateurs and gardeners enthusiasum for botany, the volumes were to become well known. Identification of the plants, in correspondence with the details in the plates, gave the work accuracy and utility beyond that of decorative books and more akin to formal botanical works.

Smith and Sowerby's partnering was not their only one, other early publication of Smith's descriptions with Sowerby plates, included ''Icones pictae plantarum rariorum descriptionibus et observationibus illustratae'' during 1790-93 and [[A Specimen of the Botany of New Holland]], a survey of exotic species found in the new colonies of Australia. 

The illustrations allowed a reader not familiar with botany to identify plants; also, the aesthetic appeal of the vivid hand coloured engravings earned Sowerby much praise. However, Smith was quietly derisive of the ability of images alone to describe a plant. He publicly opined that the graphics needed a formal description and explanation, without which only a 'superficial knowledge' could be gained from the plate. He was justifying to his professional peers, his decision to accept Sowerby's invitation to provide the text. In spite of their class differences, the two men were good friends and happily worked together on several projects over many years.

In 1814 Sowerby was offering the complete work or individual plates without text as follows:

"ENGLISH BOTANY; or, coloured figures of all the plants native of the Empire of Great Britain, by J&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;AMES&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt; S&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;OWERBY&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;; with their essential characters, synonyms, and places of growth, to which are added occasional remarks, &amp;c. by  Sir J. E. S&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;MITH&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, &amp;c. &amp;c. royal octvo. No. 1 to 267, ''£''55 7''s''.;[*] quarto copies of  the coloured ''plates only'', may be had at 1''s''. each plate; also 8vo. copies of the plates only, of any particular class or genus of plants, at 6''d'' each plate."  

Even though printed in runs of up to 900 copies (an extra-ordinarily high number for copper-plate engravings), few complete, first edition sets of the work were actually assembled. This is probably as a result of the high total selling price and a very lengthy period of publication that spanned two major wars and a famine (1805). A full first edition set comprising all 5,416 pages is now a great rarity, with only three essentially complete copies being known for certain to have survived, all of which are in private ownership.  There are numerous extant part-sets, usually comprising little more than the first half to two-thirds of the work. None of the quarto coloured plates is known to have survived.

Sowerby's son, James de Carle Sowerby published two supplements to the original work. The first Supplement, issued from July 1829 to April 1831, comprised 100 new plates numbered 2592 - 2692 together with associated texts. The second Supplement, issued from June 1831 to January 1835, comprised 104 additional plates numbered 2693 - 2796 including two fold-out illustrations. The Supplements were available either coloured or plain but most were sold plain and have long since been lost.   

Later editions of the book were to take advantage of mechanical colour printing, improving the affordability of the book but to the detriment of the image quality already seriously compromised by extensive wear to the original copper plates. The third edition in 1863 saw editor John Boswell alter the text and include a "popular portion". However, it is evident that by this third edition the original plates had already deteriorated to such a degree that many of the original fine supplemental details in the plates had to be erased to be replaced by very low-grade work by James de Carle Sowerby who also often added large, uncoloured outlines of the leaves that further reduced the quality and aesthetics of the plates. Several further editions were subsequently produced by various publishers using cheap materials and low quality methods of reproduction, each seemingly copied from the immediately prior publication thus compounding the deterioration of the images.

 *&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Equivalent to £5,421.30 in 2016 (averaged value over the years 1791 to 1814 - Bank of England Figures)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

'''''Et in Arcadia ego''''' (also known as '''''Les bergers d'Arcadie''''' or '''''The Arcadian Shepherds''''')&lt;ref&gt;Braider, Christopher, ''Refiguring the Real: Picture and Modernity in Word and Image, 1400–1700'', p. 292, 2015, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|1400872758}}, 9781400872756&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1637–38 painting by the leading painter of the classical [[17th-century French art|French Baroque]] style, [[Nicolas Poussin]] (1594–1665). It depicts a [[pastoral]] scene with idealized [[shepherd]]s from [[classical antiquity]] clustering around an austere [[tomb]]. It is held in the [[Louvre]], [[Paris]].

Poussin painted two versions of the subject under the same title; his earlier version, painted in 1627, is held at [[Chatsworth House]]. An earlier treatment of the theme was painted by [[Guercino]] circa 1618–22, also titled ''[[Et in Arcadia ego (Guercino)|Et in Arcadia ego]]''.

==Title==
The translation of the phrase is "Even in Arcadia, there am I". The usual interpretation is that "I" refers to [[Death (personification)|Death]], and "Arcadia" means a utopian land. It would thus be a ''[[memento mori]]''. During Antiquity, many Greeks lived in cities close to the sea, and led an urban life. Only [[Arcadia (ancient region)|Arcadians]], in the middle of the [[Peloponnese]], lacked cities, were far from the sea, and led a shepherd life. Thus Arcadia symbolized pure, rural, idyllic life, far from the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{etymonline|Arcadia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Poussin's biographer, [[André Félibien]], interpreted the phrase to mean that "the person buried in this tomb lived in Arcadia"; in other words, that the person too once enjoyed the pleasures of life on earth. This reading was common in the 18th and 19th centuries. For example, [[William Hazlitt]] wrote that Poussin "describes some shepherds wandering out in a morning of the spring, and coming to a tomb with this inscription, 'I also was an Arcadian'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The round table: a collection of essays on literature, men, and manners, by William Hazlitt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7HYPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA252&amp;dq=hazlitt+%22round+table%22+%22why+the+arts+are+not+progressive%22&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Why the arts are not progressive – A fragment|year=1817|page=258|publisher=Constable|location=Edinburgh and London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former interpretation ("ego" referring to Death) is now generally considered more likely; the ambiguity of the phrase is the subject of a famous essay by the [[art historian]] [[Erwin Panofsky]] (see References). Either way, the sentiment was meant to set up an [[irony|ironic]] contrast between the shadow of death and the usual idle merriment that the [[nymph]]s and swains of ancient Arcadia were thought to embody.

==Inspiration==
[[Image:Et-in-Arcadia-ego.jpg|thumb|[[Et in Arcadia ego (Guercino)|Guercino's version]] of the subject.]]
The first appearance of a tomb with a memorial inscription (to [[Daphnis]]) amid the idyllic settings of Arcadia appears in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'' V 42 ff. Virgil took the idealized Sicilian rustics that had first appeared in the ''Idylls'' of [[Theocritus]] and set them in the primitive Greek district of Arcadia (see Eclogues VII and X). The idea was taken up anew in the circle of [[Lorenzo de' Medici]] in the 1460s and 1470s, during the [[Florentine Renaissance]].

In his pastoral work ''Arcadia'' (1504), [[Jacopo Sannazaro]] fixed the Early Modern perception of Arcadia as a lost world of [[idyll]]ic bliss, remembered in regretful dirges. The first pictorial representation of the familiar ''memento mori'' theme that was popularized in 16th-century Venice, now made more concrete and vivid by the inscription &lt;small&gt;ET IN ARCADIA EGO&lt;/small&gt;, is [[Et in Arcadia ego (Guercino)|Guercino]]'s version, painted between 1618 and 1622 (in the [[Galleria Nazionale d'Arte Antica]], Rome), in which the inscription gains force from the prominent presence of a [[Skull (mythology)|skull]] in the foreground, beneath which the words are carved.

==1627 version==
[[Image:Poussin1627.jpg|thumb|[[Nicolas Poussin|Poussin's]] 1627 version of the ''Arcadian Shepherds'', in [[Chatsworth House]], depicting a different tomb with the same inscription.]]
Poussin's own first version of the painting (now in [[Chatsworth House]]) was probably commissioned as a reworking of Guercino's version. It is in a far more [[Baroque]] style than the later version, characteristic of Poussin's early work. In the Chatsworth painting the shepherds are actively discovering the half-hidden and overgrown tomb, and are reading the inscription with curious expressions. The shepherdess, standing at the left, is posed in sexually suggestive fashion, very different from her austere counterpart in the later version. The later version has a far more geometric composition and the figures are much more contemplative. The mask-like face of the shepherdess conforms to the conventions of the Classical "Greek profile".

==Interpretation==
{{more citations needed|date=January 2017}}
The most important difference between the two versions is that in the latter version, one of the two shepherds recognizes the shadow of his companion on the tomb and circumscribes the silhouette with his finger. According to an ancient tradition (see [[Pliny the Elder]], ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]'' XXXV 5, 15), this is the moment in which the art of painting is first discovered. Thus, the shepherd's shadow is the first image in art history. But the shadow on the tomb is also a symbol of death (in the first version symbolized by a skull on the top of the tomb). The meaning of this highly intricate composition seems to be that, from prehistory onward, the discovery of art has been the creative response of humankind to the shocking fact of mortality. Thus, death’s claim to rule even Arcadia is challenged by art (symbolized by the beautifully dressed maiden), who must insist that she was discovered in Arcadia too, and that she is the legitimate ruler everywhere, whilst death only usurps its power. In the face of death, art's duty—indeed, her ''raison d’être''—is to recall absent loved ones, console anxieties, evoke and reconcile conflicting emotions, surmount isolation, and facilitate the expression of the unutterable.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Becht-Jördens, Gereon; Wehmeier, Peter M. (2003). Picasso und die christliche Ikonographie. Dietrich Reimer Verlag, Berlin. pp. 181–209&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpted versions==
[[Image:Shugborough arcadia.jpg|thumb|The Shugborough relief, adapted from an engraving of Poussin's second version.]]

The undated mid-eighteenth-century marble bas-relief is part of the Shepherds Monument, a garden feature at [[Shugborough House]], Staffordshire, England. Beneath it is the cryptic [[Shugborough inscription]], as yet undeciphered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shugborough.org.uk/AcademyShepherdsMon-169 |title=The Shepherd's Monument |publisher=Shugborough |accessdate=2011-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reversed composition suggests that it was copied from an [[engraving]], the compositions of which are commonly reversed because direct copies to the plate produce mirror images on printing.

In 1832 another relief was sculpted as part of the monument marking Poussin's tomb in Rome, on which it appears beneath a bust of the artist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duepassinelmistero.com/_borders/POUSSIN_3.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the art historian Richard Verdi, it appears as if the shepherds are contemplating "their own author's death."&lt;ref&gt;Warwick, G. &amp; Scott, K., [http://assets.cambridge.org/052164/0040/sample/0521640040WSC00.pdf ''Commemorating Poussin: Reception and Interpretation of the Artist''], [[Cambridge University Press]], 1999. Cf. "Introduction: Commemorating Poussin" by Katie Scott, p. 9. "As Richard Verdi has noted, this change of context resulted in Poussin's shepherds being led to contemplate their own author's death, and invited the viewer to ponder the monument with the same solemnity and poignancy with which the shepherds brood on Death's incursion into Arcadia."
* Also cf. Verdi, Richard, "Poussin's giants: from romanticism to surrealism", in this collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

is an organization. Its main idea is to create detailed and public documentation for all stages of software creation. The foundation was established in 2002 on the grand opening of the semifinals of [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] by [[Anatoly Shalyto]]. This foundation was announced on the [[Linux Summit]] 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://is.ifmo.ru/foundation/linux/ Part of the program of Linux Summit 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shalyto|Shalyto A.]] Naumov L.

[[Image:Shalyto Linux Summit 2004.jpeg|thumb|250px|right|[[Anatoly Shalyto]] on [[Linux Summit]] 2004, Helsinki ]]

== Motivation ==
The motivation for creating ''detailed'' documentation is considered the following:
* software quality increases
* program verification simplifies
* project modification becomes easier and safer

The motivation for making documentation ''open'' is considered the following:
* project becomes less dependent on its initial authors
* other people can easily understand structure and behaviour of a program
* design decisions reuse becomes easier and safer
* it becomes possible to use real project for study purposes

== Application ==
Foundation for Open Project Documentation gives a project a greater understandability and re-usability potential, than [[open source software|Open Source foundation]]. It is loosely connected with [[Free Software Foundation]]. OpenDoc project can also be commercial.

== Main principles ==
* The project documentation should be a base for source code, but not vice versa.
* The documentation should describe not only the final product, but also the creation process.
* The documentation should be easy to understand even for less qualified developers than its author.
* The documentation should be available every time anyone explores or modifies a project.

'''''Girl, Interrupted''''' is a best-selling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,981084,00.html The Unconfessional Confessionalist], [[Time Magazine]], July 11, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; [[1993 in literature|1993]] [[memoir]] by [[Americans|American]] author [[Susanna Kaysen]], relating her experiences as a young woman in a [[psychiatric hospital]] in the 1960s after being diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]]. The memoir's title is a reference to the [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]] painting ''[[Girl Interrupted at Her Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117759846.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 Girl, Interrupted], [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], December 10, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

While writing the novel ''Far Afield'', Kaysen began to recall her almost two years at [[McLean Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5503309_ITM A teenager's interrupted life], [[Knight Ridder]] Newspapers, December 1, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained her file from the hospital with the help of a lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4491115_ITM |title=''Girl, Interrupted'' (Reel Life) |journal=Clinical Psychiatry News |date=August 1, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218150247/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4491115_ITM |archivedate=February 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the memoir was adapted into a [[Girl, Interrupted (film)|film of the same name]] starring [[Winona Ryder]], [[Angelina Jolie]] and [[Brittany Murphy]]. It was directed by [[James Mangold]].

==Plot==
In April 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen is admitted to McLean Hospital, in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], after attempting [[suicide]] by overdosing on pills. She denies that it was a suicide attempt to a psychiatrist, who suggests she take time to regroup in McLean, a private mental hospital. Susanna is diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]], and her stay extends to 18 months&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-5486864_ITM Susanna Kaysen finds stability in examining youthful 'insanity'], [[Knight Ridder|Knight-Ridder Newspapers]], August 4, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the proposed couple of weeks.

Fellow patients Polly, Cynthia, Lisa Rowe, Lisa Cody, Georgina and Daisy contribute to Susanna's experiences at McLean as she describes their personal issues and how they come to cope with the time they must spend in the hospital. Susanna also introduces the reader to particular staff members, including Valerie, Dr. Wick and Mrs. McWeeney. Susanna and the other girls are eventually informed that the recently released Daisy committed [[suicide]] on her birthday. Daisy's death deeply saddens the girls and they hold a prolonged moment of silence in her memory.

Susanna reflects on the nature of her illness, including difficulty making sense of visual patterns, and suggests that [[sanity]] is a falsehood constructed to help the "healthy" feel "normal" in comparison. She also questions how doctors treat [[mental illness]], and whether they are treating the [[brain]] or the [[mind]]. During her stay in the ward, Susanna also undergoes a period of [[depersonalization]], where she bites open the flesh on her hand after she becomes terrified that she has "lost her bones". She develops a frantic obsession with the verification of this proposed reality and even insists on seeing an X-ray of herself to make sure. This hectic moment is described with shorter, choppy sentences that show Kaysen's state of mind and thought processes as she went through them. Also, during a trip to the dentist with Valerie, Susanna becomes frantic after she wakes from the general [[anesthesia]], when no one will tell her how long she was unconscious, and she fears that she has lost time. Like the incident with her bones, Kaysen here also rapidly spirals into a panicky and obsessive state that is only ultimately calmed with medication.

After leaving McLean, Susanna mentions that she kept in touch with Georgina and eventually saw Lisa, now a single mother who was about to board the subway with her toddler son and seemed, although quirky, to be sane.

===Structure===
''Girl, Interrupted'' does not follow a linear [[Narrative structure|storyline]], but instead the author provides personal stories through a series of short descriptions of events and personal reflections on why she was placed in the hospital. She begins by talking about the concept of a parallel universe and how easy it is to slip into one, comparing insanity to an alternate world. She discusses how some people fall into insanity gradually and others just snap. Kaysen also details the doctor's visit before first going to the hospital and the taxi ride there at the beginning of the book before launching into the chronicles of her time at the hospital.

==Characters==
There are two main groups of characters, the patients and the staff. In addition to those there are her parents, her boyfriend and various other minor characters such as her former boss.

===Patients===
;Susanna Kaysen
:The autobiographical main character, Susanna Kaysen is admitted to a psychiatric ward to be treated for [[borderline personality disorder]] following a suicide attempt. She voluntarily admits herself after a short consultation with a psychiatrist who is also an acquaintance of the family. She is told that she will only be staying there for a few weeks, but it turns out to be one and a half years instead. Throughout the book, she frequently contrasts the time of the consultation, twenty minutes, to the time she ended up spending there.
;Lisa Rowe
:Lisa is diagnosed as a [[antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]], but whether she actually is one is left open to interpretation. Lisa periodically escapes from the hospital, only to be found a day or two later and re-admitted. She is usually happy enough to be back though she does put up a fight when restrained. She is an ex-junkie who never sleeps and barely eats, and enjoys making trouble for the staff. She apparently takes some pride in her diagnosis. Although she has a therapist assigned to her, she never actually sees him. Lisa is not in contact with her family except her brother, but the extent of their contact is not described. She also has a lawyer, though it appears he is mostly used to threaten the staff if she doesn't get what she wants. Her behavior is wildly unpredictable, and while she can be kind, she is also capable of cruelty towards the other patients. For example, Lisa has an ongoing rivalry with Lisa Cody that ends in Lisa Cody reverting to drugs.
;Polly Clark
:Polly is a disfigured patient who was hospitalised for [[schizophrenia]] and [[Major depressive disorder|depression]]. Polly has severe scarring on her body, the result of setting herself on fire. According to Kaysen, because of the sheer guts it took to actually do it, Polly is highly respected for her courage, to the extent that none of the patients will ask why she did it. During her first year at the hospital, she appears calm and even cheerful: "Life was hellish, she knew that. But, her smile hinted, she'd burned all that out of her."&lt;ref name=Virago&gt;Susana Kaysen, ''Girl, Interrupted'' (Virago Press, 2000 ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; But one day she suddenly breaks down and begins to scream inconsolably, as if realizing for the first time her appearance and the permanency of it. Kaysen then realizes that while the other patients might be released from the hospital, Polly is trapped forever in her scarred body.
;Georgina Tuskin
:Hospitalized for [[schizophrenia]],&lt;ref name=Virago/&gt; Georgina is Susanna's roommate at the institution. The two of them are considered the healthiest patients on the ward and are good friends throughout the book. Georgina apparently experienced her first symptoms after an episode in a movie theatre where she suddenly felt as if the darkness had surrounded her completely. It is not clear what the immediate reason for her diagnosis is. She also has a boyfriend in the hospital named Wade. 
;Lisa Cody
:Lisa is admitted to the ward after Susanna, and from her first days there she looks up to Lisa Rowe. She, too, is diagnosed as a sociopath, though Rowe questions this and is clearly annoyed that she is no longer the only sociopath there. A former drug addict like Rowe, she tries hard to defend herself from Lisa Rowe's accusations that she isn't "real". She eventually escapes and is apparently found by Lisa Rowe during one of her escapes from the hospital. Lisa tells the other girls with pride that Lisa Cody has become a "real" drug addict. Her fate after her escape is not described any further.
;Daisy Randone
:Daisy is a thin girl who arrives before Thanksgiving each year, staying through Christmas. She has a single room, where she spends most of her time. The other girls think she is addicted to [[laxatives]]. She eats only chicken, and does so only in her room. However, after letting Lisa into her room, Lisa reports back to the rest of them that she only needs the laxatives because of all of the chicken. She peels off the meat and keeps the carcasses, saying that when she has 14 carcasses, it's time to leave the hospital, possibly due to [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]]. Daisy's father visits her quite often, and it is implied he has [[incest]]uous feelings for her. Daisy eventually commits suicide on her birthday. Susanna describes her as "sexy" and says Daisy had a spark that the rest of the girls lack. Daisy is reclusive and often refuses to be social. She hates it when anyone goes near her and is hostile when people approach her. However, she does allow Lisa to enter her room. Sometimes they even share cigarettes, indicating that Daisy does respect Lisa out of all the other patients on the ward.
;Torrey
:Torrey is a former drug addict. She was put into the ward after her parents discovered her promiscuity. She is the best friend of all the fellow patients. Her parents take her out against her will, and take her back to [[Mexico]], where she believes she will become an [[amphetamine]] addict again. She describes Mexico, saying "being in Mexico means being dead and shooting speed to feel like you're not quite dead" (Kaysen, 97). The girls do try to help her with an escape plan and pool their money for her to help her, but eventually that plan is ruined, partly by Torrey herself, as she is too afraid to do it, and partly by Valerie after she gives Torrey a cup of [[thorazine]] just prior to her departure to calm her down. Though she only appears for a short time she is an important character. Kaysen distinguishes between those put there indefinitely by parents willing to pay without questioning the progress of their treatment and those whose parents are not willing to do so. Torrey is used as an example of the latter group.
;Alice Calais
:At first Alice seems quiet and, in Kaysen's words, "not too crazy"; but after about a month she breaks down and is taken to maximum security. When the girls go to visit her they find that she has painted herself and the walls in her seclusion room with her own feces. Most of the other patients believe she was "raised in a closet" because she is ignorant about the trivial things in life. For example, she has never tasted honey and doesn't know how it tastes. She is also completely unaware that her last name is a [[Calais|well-known location in France]] and is overwhelmed in awe when she hears of the [[Hundred Years' War]]. It is not explained what happens to her after the girls visit her.
;Wade
:Wade, Georgina's boyfriend, is also a patient. Wade entertains the female patients with stories about his father, who he claims to be a CIA agent. He is prone to violent outbursts, which eventually results in his being moved to the maximum-security ward.
;Cynthia Crowley
:A severely depressive patient who undergoes weekly [[electroconvulsive therapy]].&lt;ref name=Virago/&gt; There are only a few references to her in the book and she isn't a major character in it.

===Staff===
;Valerie
:The head nurse on  the ward. She works there during the day and though she can be strict she is generally liked by the patients and Kaysen in particular. She is described as down to earth and rarely uses the psychiatric terms used by the therapists, which is something that Susanna herself despises. Kaysen recalls her as honest and direct. 
;Mrs. McWeeney
:The evening nurse on the ward. Described as the exact opposite of Valerie and very much disliked by the patients. Kaysen recalls her as "clearly nuts". Valerie does not like her and tends to ignore her, although she does describe her as a professional when the patients complain to her. Although the patients don't like her, they recognize that she needs to earn a living and that she has to work somewhere for that to happen.
;Dr. Wick
:The [[consultant psychiatrist]]. She is described as very old-fashioned and easy to embarrass. Susanna purposely tries to embarrass her, deliberately saying things that she knows Dr. Wick will react to, during their sessions together. She has previously worked in Africa and her direct contact with the patients is very limited, talking to them for only a matter of minutes in a session.
;Melvin
:Kaysen's late therapist and analyst. Susanna says that the two of them used to be good friends and that she once enjoyed sessions with him. According to her, he was old, balding, and slightly unattractive. Susanna would go into his office sometimes and just sit there in silence because there wasn't very much silence in the hospital and she needed a break. However, this relationship was short-lived; Melvin rolled into the hospital parking lot, and, when greeted enthusiastically by Susanna, refused to entertain her. Her opinion of him spiraled downward from that point.

'''Google Arts &amp; Culture''' (formerly '''Google Art Project''') is an online platform through which the public can access high-resolution images of artworks housed in the initiative’s partner museums. The project was launched on 1 February 2011 by [[Google]] through its [[Google Cultural Institute]], in cooperation with 17 international museums, including the [[Tate Gallery]], [[London]]; the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]]; and the [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waters|first=Florence|title=The best online culture archives|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/8296365/The-best-online-culture-archives.html|accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The digital platform utilizes high-resolution image technology and enables users to virtually tour partner museums’ galleries, explore physical and contextual information about artworks, and compile their own virtual collection. The "walk-through" feature of the project uses Google's [[Google Street View|Street View]] technology,&lt;ref name="kennicott1"&gt;{{cite news |last=Kennicott |first=Philip |title=National Treasures: Google Art Project unlocks riches of world's galleries|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/01/AR2011020106442.html |accessdate=2 February 2011|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partner museums could select one artwork to be captured as a [[gigapixel image]] (with over 1 billion [[pixel]]s).

On April 3, 2012, Google announced a major expansion to the platform as it signed partnership agreements with 151 museums from 40 countries. The platform now features more than 32,000 artworks from 46 museums, and image acquisition is underway at the remaining partner museums. This expansion includes works from institutions like the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], the [[White House]], the Australian Rock Art Gallery at [[Griffith University]], the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]], and the [[Hong Kong Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ngak|first=Chenda|title=Google Art Project features White House, the Met, National Gallery|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57408829-501465/google-art-project-features-white-house-the-met-national-gallery/|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=April 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Google also  launched a second version of the website with new [[Google+]] features, enhanced search capabilities, and a series of educational tools.&lt;ref name="valvo1"&gt;{{cite press release|last=Valvo|first=Michael|title=Google Goes Global with Expanded Art Project|url=https://sites.google.com/a/pressatgoogle.com/art-project/press-release|publisher=Google Art Project|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The platform is now available in 18 languages, including English, Japanese, Indonesian, French, Italian, Polish, and Portuguese.&lt;ref name="Finkel-2011" /&gt;

== Site components ==

=== Features of first-generation Google Arts &amp; Culture ===

==== Virtual Gallery Tour ====
: Through the Virtual Gallery Tour (aka Gallery View) Users can virtually ‘walk through’ the galleries of each partner museum, using the same controls as Google Street View or by clicking on the gallery’s floorplan.

==== Artwork View ====
: From the Gallery View (aka Microscope View), users can zoom in on a particular artwork to view the picture in greater detail. As of April 2012, over 32,000 high-quality images are available for view. Microscope view provides users a dynamic image of an artwork, and scholarly and contextual information to enhance their understanding of the work. When examining an artwork, users may also access information detailing the physical characteristics of the image (e.g. size, material(s), artist). Partner museums were offered the option to include Viewing Notes, History of the Artwork, and Artist Information, which users can easily access from the microscope view interface. Each museum was allowed to include as much material as they wanted to contribute, so the level of information varies by museum and by artwork.&lt;ref name="Pack-2011"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Pack|first=Thomas|title=The Google Art Project is a Sight to Behold|magazine=Information Today|date=May 2011|volume=28|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using services like [[Google Scholar]] and [[YouTube]], Google includes external links for users to explore additional information about an artwork or gallery.

==== Create an Artwork Collection ====
: Users can log in with their Google Account to create their own collection. Users can compile any number of images from any of the partner museums and save specific views of artworks to create a personalized virtual exhibition. Using Google’s link abbreviator (Goo.gl), users can easily share their artwork collection with others through social media and conventional online communications mechanisms. This feature was so successful upon the platform’s launch, that Google had to dedicate additional servers to support it.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proctor|first=Nancy|title=The Google Art Project: A new Generation of Museums on the Web?|journal=Curator: The Museum Journal|date=April 2011|volume=52|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second generation platform seamlessly integrates Google's social media platform [[Google+]], so that site users can upload video and audio content to personalize their gallery, and share their collections through their social media networks.&lt;ref name="Stanislawski-2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Stanislawski|first=Piotr|title=Polska Sztuka w Google Art Project|url=http://kultura.gazeta.pl/kultura/1,114530,11473975,Polska_sztuka_w_Google_Art_Project.html|accessdate=8 April 2012|newspaper=Gazeta|date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features of second-generation Google Arts &amp; Culture ===

==== Explore and Discover ====
: In the second launch of the platform, Google updated the platform's search capabilities, so that users could more easily and intuitively find artworks. Now, users can find art by filtering their search with several categories, including: artist, museum, type of work, date, and country. The search results are displayed in a slideshow format.&lt;ref name="valvo1" /&gt; This new functionality enables site users to search across numerous collections to find artworks that fit their parameters of interest.

==== Video and Audio Content ====
: Several partner museums have opted to include guided tour or welcome videos of their galleries. This provides users the option to virtually walk through a museum themselves and listen to an audio guide at certain artworks, or to follow a video tour as an expert guides them through a gallery. For example, [[Michelle Obama]] filmed a welcome video for the White House gallery page,&lt;ref name="Keyes-2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Keyes|first=Alexa|title=Google Art Project and White House Launch 360 Tour of 'People's House'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/04/google-and-white-house-lauch-360-tour-of-rooms-artworks/|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Israel's Holocaust Museum [[Yad Vashem]] launched a YouTube channel with 400 hours of original video footage from the trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], which users can access through the museum's Arts &amp; Culture exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Heller|first=Aron|title=Israel Museum showcased in Google Art Project|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/ML_ISRAEL_GOOGLE_ART_PROJECT?SITE=GAGAI&amp;SECTION=WEATHER&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&amp;CTIME=2012-04-03-14-17-30|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=Gainesville Times/Associated Press|date=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Education ====
: Google Arts &amp; Culture includes several educational tools and resources for teachers and students. There are  educational videos, available through a YouTube channel and embedded on the Google Arts &amp; Culture web page. Next, two pages called "Look Like an Expert" and "DIY" provides several activities for site users, similar to those often found in art galleries. For example, one quiz asks site visitors to match a painting to a particular style; another asks visitors to find a symbol within a specified painting that represents a provided story. Finally, the "What's Next" page provides site visitors with a list of resources and links to various art history timelines, art toolkits, and comparative teaching resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education|url=http://www.googleartproject.com/education/|work=Google Art Project|publisher=Google|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Art Selfie ====
: Google Arts &amp; Culture includes the ability to find your fine art likeness just by snapping a selfie. You simply take a selfie in the app and it matches your face to old art museum portraits from their database. The feature went viral in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Selfie|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/17/16900392/art-selfie-facial-match-app-google-top-of-charts|work=Google’s art app is now top of iOS and Android download charts}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feature was initially created by Cyril Diagne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Selfie|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-22/google-figures-out-how-to-make-people-care-about-art-selfies|work=Out How to Make People Care About Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Selfie|url=https://www.20minutes.fr/culture/2233391-20180307-selfie-uvre-art-savez-encore|work=Votre selfie est une œuvre d’art mais vous ne le savez pas encore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
[[File:Google Street View camera in Bratislava.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Google Street View]] Camera captures 360 degree images as it moves through the location. Usually, the camera sits atop a car to capture Street View images, but the platform camera was installed on an indoor trolley.]]
[[File:Behind the Scenes- The Google Art Project at the White House.ogv|thumb|thumbtime=2:07|Video showing the technology and processes used to capture images of the [[White House]] for the Google Arts &amp; Culture]]

The platform emerged as a result of Google's "20-percent time" policy, by which employees are encouraged to spend 20% of their time working on an innovative project of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knowles|first=Jemillah|title=Google's Art Project grows larger with 151 museums online  across 140 countries|url=https://thenextweb.com/google/2012/04/03/googles-art-project-grows-larger-with-151-museums-online-across-40-countries/|work=TNW Google Blog|publisher=The Next Web|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small team of employees created the concept for the platform after a discussion on how to use the firm's technology to make museum’ artwork more accessible.&lt;ref name="Sood-2011"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sood|first=Amit|title=Explore museums and great works of art in the Google Art Project|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/explore-museums-and-great-works-of-art.html|work=Google Official Blog|publisher=Google|accessdate=22 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The platform concept fits the firm's mission "to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Google|url=https://www.google.com/intl/en/about/|publisher=Google|accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Accordingly, in mid-2009, Google executives agreed to support the project, and they engaged online curators of numerous museums to commit to the initiative.&lt;ref name="Berwick-2011"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Berwick|first=Carly|title=Up Close and Personal with Google Art Project|magazine=Art in America|date=April 2011|volume=99|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Technology used ===
The team leveraged existing technologies, including [[Google Street View]] and [[Picasa]], and built new tools specifically for the platform.

They created an indoor-version of the Google Street View 360-degree camera system to capture gallery images by pushing the camera 'trolley' through a museum. It also used professional panoramic heads Clauss Rodeon VR Head Hd And Clauss VR Head ST to take high resolution photos of the artworks within a gallery .This technology allowed th excellent attention to detail and the highest image resolution. Each partner museum selected one artwork to be captured at ultra-high resolution with approximately 1,000 times more detail than the average digital camera.&lt;ref name="Pack-2011" /&gt; The largest image, [[Alexander Andreyevich Ivanov]]'s ''The Apparition of Christ to the People'', is over 12 gigapixels. To maximize image quality, the  team coordinated with partner museums’ lighting technicians and photography teams. For example, at the [[Tate Britain]], the they collaborated to capture a gigapixel image of ''[[No Woman No Cry (painting)|No Woman No Cry]]'' in both natural light and in the dark. The Tate suggested this method to capture the painting's hidden phosphorescent image, which glows in the dark. The Google camera team had to adapt their method, and keep the camera shutter open for 8 seconds in the dark to capture a distinct enough image. Now, unlike at the Tate, from the site one can view the painting in both light settings.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=James|title=Google Art Project: Behind the Scenes|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/context-comment/blog/google-art-project-behind-scenes-glowy-night-museum|work=Tate Blogs|publisher=Tate Britain|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the images were captured, the team used Google Street View software and GPS data to seamlessly stitch the images and connect them to museum floor plans. Each image was mapped according to longitude and latitude, so that users can seamlessly transition to it from Google Maps, looking inside the partner museums’ galleries. Street View was also integrated with Picasa, for seamless transition from gallery view to microscope view.&lt;ref name="Sood-2011" /&gt;

The user interface lets site visitors virtually ‘walk through’ galleries with Google Street View, and look at artworks with Picasa, which provides the microscope view to zoom in to images for greater detail than is visible to the naked eye.&lt;ref name="Pack-2011" /&gt; Additionally, the microscope view of artworks incorporates other resources—including [[Google Scholar]], [[Google Docs]] and [[YouTube]]—so users can link to external content to learn more about the work.&lt;ref name="Mediati-2011"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Mediati|first=Nick|title=An extension of Google Street View enables interactive, Web-based virtual museum tours|magazine=PC World|date=April 2011|volume=29|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the platform incorporates Google’s URL shortener ([[Google URL Shortener|Goo.gl]]), so that users can save and easily share their personal collections.&lt;ref name="Mediati-2011" /&gt;

The platform has been integrated with the social media platform Google+  to enable users to share their personal collections with their networks. This integration also lets site visitors use Google+ Hangouts for more interactive purposes. These situations might include: a professor giving an online lecture to students, engaging in video and shared-screen discussions about a collection, or an expert leading a virtual tour of a distant museum to remote attendees.&lt;ref name="Stanislawski-2012" /&gt;

The resulting  platform is a Java-based Google App Engine Web application, which exists on Google’s infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Mediati-2011" /&gt;

=== Technology limitations ===
[[File:Hans Holbein the Younger - The Ambassadors - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'']]

Luc Vincent, director of engineering at Google and head of the team responsible for Street View for the platform, stated concern over the quality of panorama cameras his team used to capture gallery and artwork images. In particular, he believes that improved aperture control would enable more consistent quality of gallery images.&lt;ref name="Pack-2011" /&gt;

Some artworks were particularly difficult to capture and re-present accurately as virtual, two-dimensional images. For example, Google described the inclusion of [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]'s ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]'' as "tough". This was due to the [[Anamorphosis|anamorphic]] techniques distorting the image of a skull in the foreground of the painting. When looking at the original painting at the National Gallery in London, the depiction of the skull appears distorted until the viewer physically steps to the side of the painting. Once the viewer is looking at the shape from the intended vantage point, the lifelike depiction of the skull materializes. The effect is still apparent in the gigapixel version of the painting, but was less pronounced in the "walk-through" function.&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;

As ''New York Times'' art reviewer [[Roberta Smith]] said: “[Google Arts &amp; Culture] is very much a work in progress, full of bugs and information gaps, and sometimes blurry, careering virtual tours.”&lt;ref name="Pack-2011" /&gt; Though the second generation platform solved some technological issues, the firm plans to continue developing additional enhancements for the site. Future improvements currently under consideration include: upgrading panorama cameras, more detailed web metrics, and improved [[Search Engine Optimization|searchability]] through metatagging and user-generated metatagging.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012" /&gt; The firm is also considering the addition of an experimental page to the platform, to highlight emerging technologies that artists are using to showcase their works.&lt;ref name="GAP-FAQs"&gt;{{cite web|title=FAQs|url=http://www.googleartproject.com/faqs/|work=Google Art Project|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Institutions and works ==
Seventeen partner museums were included in the launch of the project. The original 1,061 high-resolution images (by 486 different artists) are shown in 385 virtual gallery rooms, with 6,000 [[Street View]]–style panoramas.&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Google and museums around the world unveil Art Project|url=https://sites.google.com/a/pressatgoogle.com/art-project/press-site-v1/press-release-v1 |publisher=Google Art Project|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 3, 2012, Google announced the expansion of the platform to include 151 museums. At the time of the announcement, 46 of those museums and their works are available on the website. Like the original 17 partners, each of the new partners has a gigapixel image of one of their works on the platform platform.&lt;ref name="valvo1" /&gt;

Google has been dedicated to making the platform a more global project, so it sought to expand its partnerships with local, regional and national museums from 40 countries.&lt;ref name="Finkel-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Finkel|first=Jori|title=LACMA, Getty among 134 museums joining Google's art site|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/culturemonster/2012/04/lacma-getty-sfmoma-among-134-museums-joining-googles-art-site.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=LA Times|date=2 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the platform now also offers galleries the option to submit a form and apply for partnership with Google.

== Influences ==
As early as the late-1980s, art museum personnel began to consider how they could exploit the [[Internet]] to achieve their institutions' missions through online platforms. For example, in 1994 Elizabeth Broun, Director of the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], spoke to the Smithsonian Commission on the future of art, stating: "We need to put our institutional energy behind the idea of getting the Smithsonian hooked up to the people and schools of America." She then outlined the museum's objective to conserve, protect, present, and interpret exhibits, explaining how electronic media could help achieve these goals.&lt;ref name="Broun-1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Broun|first=Elizabeth|title=The Future of Art at the Smithsonian|journal=American Art|date=Summer 1994|volume=8|issue=3/4|pages=2–7|jstor=3109168|doi=10.1086/424219}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion of internet programs and resources has shaped the development of the platform.&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Proctor|first=N|title=The Google Art Project: A New Generation of Museums on the Web?|journal=Curator: The Museum Journal|year=2011|volume=54|pages=215–221|doi=10.1111/j.2151-6952.2011.00083.x|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Contemporary Google initiatives ===
[[File:Toledomuseumofart.JPG|thumb|The [[Toledo Museum of Art]] worked with Google to remove 21 artworks from their virtual exhibition because the artists (or their heirs) still hold the copyright to the images.]]

Another Google initiative—[[Google Books]]—affected the development of the platform from a non-technological perspective. Google recently faced a six-year-long court case relating to several [[Authors Guild v. Google|issues with copyright infringement]]. Google Books catalogued full digital copies of texts, including those still protected by copyright, though Google claimed it was permissible under the [[fair use]] clause. Google ended up paying $125 million to copyright-holders of the protected books, though the [[Google Books#Settlement agreement|settlement agreement]] was modified and debated several times before it was ultimately rejected by federal courts. In his decision, Judge Denny Chin stated the settlement agreement would "give Google a significant advantage over competitors, rewarding it for engaging in wholesale copying of copyrighted works without permission," and could lead to antitrust issues. Judge Chin said in future open-access initiatives, Google should use an "opt-in" method, rather than providing copyright owners the option to "opt out" of an arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Efrati|first=Amir|title=Judge Rejects Google Books Settlement|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704461304576216923562033348|accessdate=9 April 2012|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After this controversy, Google took a different approach on intellectual property rights for the Google Arts &amp; Culture. The platform's intellectual property policy is:
:''The high resolution imagery of artworks featured on the platform site are owned by the museums, and these images may be subject to copyright laws around the world. The Street View imagery is owned by Google. All of the imagery on this site is provided for the sole purpose of enabling you to use and enjoy the benefit of the platform site, in the manner permitted by Google’s Terms of Service . The normal Google Terms of Service apply to your use of the entire site.''&lt;ref name="GAP-FAQs" /&gt;

The Google team was sensitive to copyright issues of artworks, and partner museum staff were able to ask Google to blur out the images of certain works, which are still protected by copyrights. In a few cases, museums wanted to include artworks by modern and contemporary artists, many of whom still hold the copyright to their work. For example, the Tate Britain approached [[Chris Ofili]] to get his permission to capture and reproduce his works on the platform.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

However, since the project expanded in April 2012, Google has faced a few intellectual property issues. Some of the works added to the online exhibitions are still protected by [[copyright]], as the artist or his or her heirs holds the right to the image for 70 years. As a result, the [[Toledo Museum of Art]] asked Google to remove 21 artworks from the website, including works by [[Henri Matisse]] and other modern artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Patricia|title=Art is Long; Copyrights Can Be Even Longer|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/arts/design/artists-rights-society-vaga-and-intellectual-property.html?pagewanted=1&amp;_r=3|accessdate=26 April 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Google Cultural Institute===
{{As of|2013|12|alt=By December 2013}}, the contents of the project were accessible from [[Google Cultural Institute]], a site that works similarly. It features digitized objects from archives, libraries and a wider array of museums not strictly devoted to art. This initiative is increasingly subsuming the Google Arts &amp; Culture within its wider ambit.

== Reception ==
The Google Arts &amp; Culture stirred up debate among scholars, museum personnel, art critics, and news writers. Since its initial launch, it has received fairly consistent positive feedback, and a variety of criticisms. With the second generation platform, Google appears to have responded to some earlier criticisms.

=== Praise ===
Positive feedback about the platform has centered on an increased audience gaining access to art, the marketing [[externality]] for museums, and the potential for future development of the initiative.
* '''Increases access to art.''' So long as one has internet access, anyone, anywhere, at any time can visit the Google Arts &amp; Culture, enabling audiences who otherwise would be unlikely to visit these museums to see their works. "Armchair tourists" are now able to tour some of the world's greatest art exhibits without leaving their seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ionescu|first=Daniel|title=Google's Art Project Extended Worldwide|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104220826/http://www.pcworld.com/article/253092/googles_art_project_extended_worldwide.html|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/253092/googles_art_project_extended_worldwide.html|deadurl=no|archivedate=2013-11-04|work=PC World Blogs|publisher=PC World|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professors and students can go on virtual field trips without the usual associated costs, and have a remote conversation with an expert from a museum or other institution.&lt;ref name="Stanislawski-2012" /&gt;
* '''Better visitor experience.''' Users of the site can avoid constraints of time, money and physical difficulty. They need not plan a restrictive one-time visit to a collection, or arrive find out a work is not on view. They are not bothered by other visitors.
* '''Triggers new visitors''' Many art historians and scholars have posited that online exhibitions would drive more people to the gallery, and the Google Arts &amp; Culture has supported this theory. Research established that there is a statistically significant relationship between those who visit the platform and those who are inspired to go on a real tour of a museum.&lt;ref name="Bararia-2012"&gt;{{cite web|last=Bararia|first=Khushboo|title=Promotion of Virtual Tourism through Google Art Projects|url=http://repository.christuniversity.in/1741/|work=Masters Thesis|publisher=Christ University|accessdate=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In further support of this concept, within two weeks of the launch of the platform, MoMA saw its website's traffic increase by about 7%.&lt;ref name="Berwick-2011" /&gt; It is, however, unclear how many physical visitors came to MoMA as a result of the platform.
* '''Complements real visits to a gallery.''' While there has been some skepticism that the Google Arts &amp; Culture seeks to replace real-time visits to art galleries, many have suggested that the virtual tours actually complement real-time visits. Research shows that people are more likely to enjoy their real-time visit to a museum after participating in a virtual tour.&lt;ref name="Bararia-2012" /&gt; Several museum personnel have supported this concept anecdotally. Julian Raby, director of the [[Freer Gallery of Art]] stated: “The gigapixel experience brings us very close to the essence of the artist through detail that simply can’t be seen in the gallery itself. Far from eliminating the necessity of seeing artworks in person, [Arts &amp; Culture] deepens our desire to go in search of the real thing.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sood|first=Amit|title=Amit Sood: Technologist|url=http://www.ted.com/speakers/amit_sood.html|work=Speakers|publisher=TED|accessdate=24 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view was shared by Brian Kennedy, director of the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], who believed that academics would still want to view artwork in three dimensions, even if the gigapixel images provided better clarity than viewing the artwork in the gallery. Similarly, Amit Sood—the Google project leader—said that "nothing beats the first-person experience".&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;
* '''Has future development potential.''' Some scholars and art critics believe the Google Arts &amp; Culture will change how museums use the web. For instance, Nancy Proctor—Head of Mobile Strategy &amp; Initiatives at the Smithsonian—suggested that museums may eventually utilize the platform to provide museum maps and gallery information instead of printed materials. It might become possible for museum visitors to hold up their smart phone in front of an artwork, and the platform could overlay information. the platform could also provide a seamless transition from a Google Map to an inside gallery map, avoiding the need for printed collateral.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012" /&gt;
* '''Democratization of culture.''' With the rapid increase of information that is available online, we are in a period of [[democratization of knowledge]]. An elite group of professionals and experts are no longer the only people with the ability to distribute respected information. Rather, through web-based initiatives like Wikipedia, anyone with web access can contribute to and help shape public knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sanger|first=Larry|title=Who Says We Know: On the New Politics of Knowledge|url=http://www.edge.org/3rd_culture/sanger07/sanger07_index.html|work=Edge: The Third Culture|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Google Arts &amp; Culture is, according to some, a democratic initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Inanoglu|first=Zeynep|title=Google Art Project: Democratizing Art|url=http://yunus.hacettepe.edu.tr/~umutal/publications/elpub2011.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to give more people access to art by removing barriers like cost and location. Some art or cultural exhibits have been limited to a small group of viewers (e.g. PhD students, academic researchers) due to deteriorating condition of a work, lack of available wall space in a museum, or other similar factors. Digitized reproductions, however, can be accessible to anyone from any location. This type of online resource can transform research and academia by opening access to previously exclusive art works, enabling multidisciplinary and multi-institutional learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guerlac|first=Suzanne|title=Humanities 2.0: E-Learning in the Digital World|journal=Representations|date=Fall 2011|volume=116|series=The Humanities and the Crisis of the Public University|issue=1|pages=102–127|doi=10.1525/rep.2011.116.1.102}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provides people the opportunity to experience art individually, and a platform to become involved in conversation.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012" /&gt; For example, the platform now lets users [[#Site components|contribute]] their own content, adding their insight to the public collection of knowledge.

Many scholars have argued that we are experiencing a breakdown of the canon of high art,&lt;ref name="Broun-1994" /&gt; and the Google Arts &amp; Culture is beginning to reflect this.  When it just included the Grand Masters of Western Art, the project faced strong [[#Criticism|criticism]]. As a result of this outburst, the website now includes some indigenous and graffiti artworks. This platform also provides a new context through which people encounter art, ultimately reflecting this shift away from the canon of high art.&lt;ref name="Proctor-2012" /&gt;

=== Criticism ===
A few initial criticisms of the platform—including skewed representation of artworksˇhave lost some validity with the launch of the second generation platform.
* '''[[Eurocentrism]]:''' During its initial launch, many critics argued that the Google Arts &amp; Culture provided a Western-biased representation of art. Most museums included in the first phase of the Project were from Western Europe, Washington, DC, and New York, NY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|title=Getting in close and impersonal|url=http://search.proquest.com./docview/849706905|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=The Economist|date=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Diana Skaar, head of partnerships for the platform, Google responded: “After the launch of round one, we got an overwhelming response from museums worldwide. So for round two, we really wanted to balance regional museums with those that are more nationally or globally recognized.”&lt;ref name="Finkel-2011" /&gt; Now, the platform's expanded repository includes graffiti works, dot paintings, rock art and indigenous artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hayward|first=Andrea|title=ARTS: Global artworks now a click away|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/963815632|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=Australian Associated Press Pty Limited|date=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the firm may have responded to this issue, there are other neglected criticisms:
* '''Selection of content:''' Although the Google Arts &amp; Culture is now partners with 134 new museums, some critics believe it still may present a skewed representation of art and art history. Google and the partner museums are able to decide what information to include, and what artworks they will make available (and at what level of quality); some believe this is counter-intuitive to the website's seemingly democratic objective.&lt;ref name="Sooke-2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sooke|first=Alistair|title=The Problem With Google's Art Project|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/8296251/The-problem-with-Googles-Art-Project.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in the White House virtual collection, one photo of a former First Lady does not include a key piece of information to understand the context of the image. Grace Coolidge often wore brightly colored clothes. In her White House portrait, she was dressed in a red sleeveless flapper dress, and stood next to a large white dog. There are two versions of this picture: one showing Coolidge on a white background with softer lines, and one showing her on the White House lawn. The Google Arts &amp; Culture description leaves out the reason for why there are two images. President Coolidge preferred his wife to a white dress. The artist, however, wanted the dress to contrast with the white dog. So, the President Coolidge then retorted, "Dye the dog!"&lt;ref name="Keyes-2012" /&gt; While perhaps not crucial to understanding the exhibit, this and other examples show that the Google Arts &amp; Culture and partner museums are in a position of power to curate the content and educational information of the virtual exhibition.&lt;ref name="Sooke-2011" /&gt;
* '''Audience:''' Some critics have expressed concern over the intended audience of the platform, as this should shape the type of content available through the platform. For example, Director of the Center for the Future of Museums, Elizabeth Merritt, described the project as an "interesting experiment" but was skeptical as to its intended audience.&lt;ref name="kennicott1" /&gt;
* '''Possible security risks:''' Some critics have raised the question of how Arts &amp; Culture visitors might maliciously use the Street View images. For example, by providing highly detailed images of galleries, people could use this platform to map out museum security systems, and then be able to circumvent these protective measures during a break-in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nonnenmacher|first=Peter|title=Virtuelle Tiefenschärfe|url=http://www.wienerzeitung.at/nachrichten/kultur/kunst/29137_Virtuelle-Tiefenschaerfe.html|accessdate=6 April 2012|newspaper=Wiener Zeitung|date=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graphic design''' is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of [[typography]], [[photography]] and [[illustration]]. The field is considered a subset of [[visual communication]] and [[communication design]], but sometimes the term "graphic [[design]]" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use [[typography]], [[visual arts]] and [[page layout]] techniques to create [[Composition (visual arts)|visual compositions]]. Common uses of graphic design include [[corporate design]] (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), [[wayfinding|wayfinding or environmental design]], [[advertising]], [[web design]], [[communication design]], product [[Packaging and labeling|packaging]] and [[signage]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of graphic design}}
[[Image:KellsFol114vTuncDicit.gif|thumb|Page from the [[Book of Kells]]: Folio 114v, Decorated text. ''Tunc dicit illis'']]The term graphic design was coined by [[William Addison Dwiggins]] in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. [[Pearson Education]], 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the origins of graphic design can be traced from the origins of human existence, from the caves of [[Lascaux]], to Rome's [[Trajan's Column]] to the [[illuminated manuscript]]s of the Middle Ages, to the neon lights of [[Ginza]], [[Tokyo]]. In "Babylon, artisans pressed cuneiform inscriptions into clay bricks or tablets which were used for construction. The bricks gave information such as the name of the reigning monarch, the builder, or some other dignitary".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Advertising In America|last = Ulanoff|first = Stanley M.|publisher = |year = |isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first known road sign announcing the name of the governor of a state or mayor of the city. The Egyptians developed communication by hieroglyphics that used picture symbols dating as far back as 136 B.C. found on the [[Rosetta Stone]]. "The Rosetta stone, found by one of Napoleon's engineers was an advertisement for the Egyptian ruler, Ptolemy as the "true Son of the Sun, the Father of the Moon, and the Keeper of the Happiness of Men"" &lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The Egyptians also invented [[papyrus]], paper made from reeds found along the Nile, on which they transcribed advertisements more common among their people at the time. During the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", from 500 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt; to 1450 &lt;small&gt;AD&lt;/small&gt;, monks created elaborate, illustrated manuscripts.

In both its lengthy history and in the relatively recent explosion of [[visual communication]] in the 20th and 21st centuries, the distinction between [[advertising]], art, graphic design and [[fine art]] has disappeared. They share many elements, theories, principles, practices, [[language]]s and sometimes the same benefactor or client. In advertising, the ultimate objective is the sale of goods and services. In graphic design, "the essence is to give order to information, form to ideas, expression, and feeling to artifacts that document human experience."&lt;ref&gt;Meggs, Philip B., 'A history of graphic design'. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic design in the United States began with [[Benjamin Franklin]] who used his newspaper ''[[Pennsylvania Gazette|The Pennsylvania Gazette]]'', to master the art of publicity to promote his own books and to influence the masses. "Benjamin Franklin's ingenuity gained in strength as did his cunning and in 1737 he had replaced his counterpart in Pennsylvania, [[Andrew Bradford]] as postmaster and printer after a competition he instituted and won. He showed his prowess by running an ad in his ''General Magazine and the Historical Chronicle of British Plantations in America'' (the precursor to the [[The Saturday Evening Post|Saturday Evening Post]]) that stressed the benefits offered by a stove he invented, named called the ''Pennsylvania Fireplace''. His invention is still sold today and is known as ''the [[Franklin stove]]''. "&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Advertising Age. How It Was In Advertising: 1776-1976. Chicago, Illinois: Crain Books, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

American advertising initially imitated British newspapers and magazines. Advertisements were printed in scrambled type and uneven lines that made it difficult to read. Franklin better organized this by adding 14-point type for the first line of the advertisement; although later shortened and centered it, making "headlines". Franklin added illustrations, something that London printers had not attempted. Franklin was the first to utilize [[logo]]s, which were early symbols that announced such services as opticians by displaying golden spectacles. Franklin taught advertisers that the use of detail was important in marketing their products. Some advertisements ran for 10-20 lines, including color, names, varieties, and sizes of the goods that were offered.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

===The advent of printing===
{{Main article|History of printing}}
During the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907) wood blocks were cut to print on textiles and later to reproduce Buddhist texts. A Buddhist scripture printed in 868 is the earliest known printed book. Beginning in the 11th century, longer scrolls and books were produced using [[movable type]] printing, making books widely available during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279).&lt;ref&gt;" Printing" The Silk Road Foundation. Retrieved May 31, 2008. [http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml Silk-road.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509141910/http://www.silk-road.com/artl/printing.shtml |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 17th-18th century movable type was used for handbills or trade cards which were printed from wood or copper engravings. These documents announced a business and its location. English painter [[William Hogarth]] used his skill in engraving was one of the first to design for business trade.

In Mainz Germany, in 1448, [[Johann Gutenberg]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;introduced movable type using a new metal alloy for use in a [[printing press]] and opened a new era of commerce. This made graphics more readily available since mass printing dropped the price of printing material significantly. Previously, most advertising was word of mouth. In France and England, for example, [[Town crier|criers]] announced products for sale just as [[Ancient Rome|ancient Romans]] had done.

The printing press made books more widely available. [[Aldus Manutius]] developed the book structure that became the foundation of western publication design. This era of graphic design is called [[Renaissance Humanism|Humanist]] or Old Style. Additionally, [[William Caxton]], England's first printer produced religious books, but had trouble selling them. He discovered the use of leftover pages and used them to announce the books and post them on church doors. This practice was termed ''"squis"'' or ''"pin up" posters,'' in approximately 1612, becoming the first form of print advertising in Europe''.'' The term ''Siquis'' came from the Roman era when public notices were posted stating ''"if anybody..."'', which is Latin for ''"si quis"''. These printed announcements were followed by later public registers of ''wants'' called ''want ads'' and in some areas such as the first periodical in Paris advertising was termed "advices". The "Advices" were what we know today as ''want ad media'' or ''advice columns''.

In 1638 [[Harvard University]] received a printing press from England. More than 52 years passed before London bookseller [[Benjamin Harris (publisher)|Benjamin Harris]] received another printing press in Boston. Harris published a newspaper in serial form, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'[[Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick|Publick Occurrences Both Foreign and Domestick'&lt;nowiki/&gt;]]''. It was four pages long and suppressed by the government after its first edition.

John Campbell is credited for the first newspaper, the ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'[[The Boston News-Letter|Boston News-Letter]]'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'', which appeared in 1704. The paper was known during the revolution as ''"Weeklies"''. The name came from the 13 hours required for the ink to dry on each side of the paper. ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'The solution was to first, print the ads and then to print the news on the other side the day before publication. The paper was four pages long having ads on at least 20%-30% of the total paper, (pages one and four) the hot news was located on the inside.'''&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The initial use of the ''Boston News-Letter'' carried Campbell's own solicitations for advertising from his readers. Campbell's first paid advertisement was in his third edition, May 7 or 8th,  1704. Two of the first ads were for stolen anvils. The third was for real estate in [[Oyster Bay (town), New York|Oyster Bay]], owned by [[William Bradford (Colonial printer)|William Bradford]], a pioneer printer in New York, and the first to sell something of value. Bradford published his first newspaper in 1725, New York's first, the [[New-York Gazette]]''. Bradford's son preceded him in Philadelphia publishing the ''[[Andrew Bradford|American Weekly Mercury]]'', 1719. ''The Mercury'' and William Brooker's ''Massachusetts Gazette'', first published a day earlier.

===Design industry===
In late 19th-century Europe, especially in the United Kingdom, the first official publication of a printed design was released, marking the separation of graphic design from fine art.

In 1849, [[Henry Cole]] became one of the major forces in [[design education]] in Great Britain, informing the government of the importance of design in his ''Journal of Design and Manufactures''. He organized the [[Great Exhibition]] as a celebration of modern industrial technology and Victorian design.

From 1891 to 1896, [[William Morris]]' Kelmscott Press published some of the most significant of the graphic design products of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], and made a lucrative business of creating and selling stylish books. Morris created a market for works of graphic design in their own right and a profession for this new type of art. The Kelmscott Press is characterized by an obsession with historical styles. This historicism was the first significant reaction to the state of nineteenth-century graphic design. Morris' work, along with the rest of the [[Private Press]] movement, directly influenced [[Art Nouveau]].&lt;ref name=mccarthy&gt;Fiona McCarthy, ''William Morris'', London: Faber and Faber, 1996 {{ISBN|0-571-17495-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "graphic design" first appeared in print in the 1922 essay "New Kind of Printing Calls for New Design" by [[William Addison Dwiggins]], an American book designer in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Johanna and McVarish, Emily, 'Graphic Design History: A critical Guide'. Pearson Education, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Raffe's ''Graphic Design'', published in 1927, was the first book to use "Graphic Design" in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baker|first=Steve |year=1990|title=The Sign of the Self in the Metropolis |journal=Journal of Design History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |volume= 3|jstor=1315763|issue= 4|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The signage in the [[London Underground]] is a classic design example&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Designing Modern Britain - Design Museum Exhibition | url = http://designmuseum.org/design/london-transport | accessdate = December 10, 2009 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100107205325/http://designmuseum.org/design/london-transport | archivedate = January 7, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the modern era&lt;!-- 'The modern era' should be introduced.

In the 1920s, Soviet [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] applied 'intellectual production' in different spheres of production. The movement saw individualistic art as useless in revolutionary Russia and thus moved towards creating objects for utilitarian purposes. They designed buildings, theater sets, posters, fabrics, clothing, furniture, logos, menus, etc.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Jan Tschichold]] codified the principles of [[modern typography]] in his 1928 book, ''New Typography''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8CPmMRRx1DEC&amp;pg=PT333&amp;dq=Jan+Tschichold+codified+the+principles+of+modern+typography+in+his+1928+book,+New+Typography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0luGFltDYAhVGLmMKHdq3B18Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Tschichold%20codified%20the%20principles%20of%20modern%20typography%20in%20his%201928%20book,%20New%20Typography&amp;f=false|title=Advertising Design and Typography|last=White|first=Alex W.|date=2010-09-21|publisher=Allworth Press|isbn=9781581158205|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180111150056/https://books.google.com/books?id=8CPmMRRx1DEC&amp;pg=PT333&amp;dq=Jan+Tschichold+codified+the+principles+of+modern+typography+in+his+1928+book,+New+Typography&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0luGFltDYAhVGLmMKHdq3B18Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Jan%20Tschichold%20codified%20the%20principles%20of%20modern%20typography%20in%20his%201928%20book,%20New%20Typography&amp;f=false|archivedate=2018-01-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later repudiated the philosophy he espoused in this book as fascistic, but it remained influential.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Tschichold, [[Bauhaus]] typographers such as [[Herbert Bayer]] and [[László Moholy-Nagy]] and [[El Lissitzky]] greatly influenced graphic design.

''Modernism in Art Design and Architecture'', New York: [[St. Martins Press]]. {{ISBN|0-312-21830-3}} (cloth) {{ISBN|0-312-21832-X}} (pbk)&lt;/ref&gt; The post-World War II American economy revealed a greater need for graphic design, mainly in advertising and packaging. The spread of the German [[Bauhaus]] school of design to Chicago in 1937 brought a "mass-produced" minimalism to America; sparking "modern" [[architecture]] and design. Notable names in mid-century modern design include [[Adrian Frutiger]], designer of the [[typeface]]s [[Univers]] and [[Frutiger (typeface)|Frutiger]]; [[Paul Rand]], who took the principles of the Bauhaus and applied them to popular advertising and logo design, helping to create a uniquely American approach to European minimalism while becoming one of the principal pioneers of the subset of graphic design known as [[corporate identity]]; [[Alex Steinweiss]], credited with the invention of the album cover; and [[Josef Müller-Brockmann]], who designed posters in a severe yet accessible manner typical of the 1950s and 1970s era.

The professional graphic design industry grew in parallel with [[consumerism]]. This raised concerns and criticisms, notably from within the graphic design community with the [[First Things First 1964 manifesto|First Things First manifesto]]. First launched by [[Ken Garland]] in 1964, it was re-published as the [[First Things First 2000 manifesto]] in 1999 in the magazine ''[[Emigre (magazine)|Emigre]]'' 51&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&amp;id=14 |title=฿Emigre Essays |publisher=Emigre.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106152041/http://emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=1&amp;id=14 |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; stating "We propose a reversal of priorities in favor of more useful, lasting and democratic forms of communication - a mindshift away from product marketing and toward the exploration and production of a new kind of meaning. The scope of debate is shrinking; it must expand. Consumerism is running uncontested; it must be challenged by other perspectives expressed, in part, through the visual languages and resources of design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |title=max bruinsma |publisher=Maxbruinsma.nl |date= |accessdate=2012-01-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219160927/http://maxbruinsma.nl/index1.html?ftf2000.htm |archivedate=2011-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both editions attracted signatures from practitioners and thinkers such as [[Rudy VanderLans]], [[Erik Spiekermann]], [[Ellen Lupton]] and [[Rick Poynor]]. The 2000 manifesto was also published in [[Adbusters]], known for its strong critiques of visual culture.

==Applications==
[[File:Secretary.jpg|thumb|[[Colour]]]]
Graphic design is applied to everything visual, from [[Traffic sign|road signs]] to technical schematics, from interoffice [[memorandum]]s to reference [[User guide|manuals]].

Design can aid in selling a [[Product (business)|product]] or [[idea]]. It is applied to products and elements of company identity such as [[logo]]s, colors, [[packaging]] and text as part of [[brand]]ing (see also [[advertising]]). Branding has become increasingly more important in the range of services offered by graphic designers. Graphic designers often form part of a branding team.

Graphic design is applied in the [[entertainment]] industry in decoration, scenery and visual story telling. Other examples of design for entertainment purposes include novels, vinyl [[album cover]]s, comic books, DVD covers, [[opening credits]] and [[closing credits]] in [[filmmaking]], and programs and props on stage. This could also include artwork used for T-shirts and other items screenprinted for sale.

From scientific journals to news reporting, the presentation of opinion and facts is often improved with graphics and thoughtful compositions of visual information - known as [[information design]]. Newspapers, magazines, blogs, television and film documentaries may use graphic design. With the advent of the web, information designers with experience in interactive tools are increasingly used to illustrate the background to news stories. Information design can include [[data visualization]], which involves using programs to interpret and form data into a visually compelling presentation, and can be tied in with [[information graphics]].

==Skills==
A graphic design project may involve the stylization and presentation of existing [[writing|text]] and either preexisting [[image]]ry or images developed by the graphic designer. Elements can be incorporated in both traditional and digital form, which involves the use of visual arts, typography, and page layout techniques. Graphic designers organize pages and optionally add graphic elements. Graphic designers can commission photographers or illustrators to create original pieces. Designers use digital tools, often referred to as [[interactive design]], or [[multimedia]] design. Designers need communication skills to convince an audience and sell their designs.

The "process school" is concerned with communication; it highlights the channels and media through which messages are transmitted and by which senders and receivers encode and decode these message. The semiotic school treats a message as a construction of signs which through interaction with receivers, produces meaning; communication as an agent.

===Typography===
{{Main article|Typography}}

Typography includes type design, modifying type [[glyphs]] and arranging type. Type glyphs (characters) are created and modified using illustration techniques. Type arrangement is the selection of typefaces, point size, tracking (the space between all characters used), kerning (the space between two specific characters) and leading (line spacing).

Typography is performed by typesetters, compositors, typographers, graphic artists, art directors and clerical workers. Until the digital age, typography was a specialized occupation. Certain fonts communicate or resemble stereotypical notions. For example 1942 Report is a font which types text akin to a typewriter or a vintage report.&lt;ref&gt;Butterick, Matthew. "Butterick's Practical Typography." Butterick's Practical Typography. Jones McClure, 2010-14. Web. 17 Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Page layout===
{{Main article|Page layout}}
[[File:Golden section in book design.svg|thumb|Golden section in book design]]
Page layout deals with the arrangement of elements (content) on a page, such as image placement, text layout and style. Page design has always been a consideration in printed material and more recently extended to displays such as web pages. Elements typically consist of [[typography|type]] (text), [[image]]s (pictures), and (with print media) occasionally place-holder graphics such as a [[dieline]] for elements that are not printed with ink such as [[Die (manufacturing)|die]]/[[laser cutting]], [[foil stamping]] or [[Embossing (paper)|blind embossing]].

===Printmaking===
{{Main article|Printmaking}}

Printmaking is the process of making artworks by printing on [[paper]] and other materials or surfaces. The process is capable of producing multiples of the same work, each called a print. Each print is an original, technically known as an impression. Prints are created from a single original surface, technically a matrix. Common types of matrices include: plates of metal, usually copper or zinc for engraving or etching; stone, used for lithography; blocks of wood for woodcuts, linoleum for linocuts and fabric plates for screen-printing. Works printed from a single plate create an edition, in modern times usually each signed and numbered to form a limited edition. Prints may be published in book form, as artist's books. A single print could be the product of one or multiple techniques.[[Image:Pencils hb.jpg|thumb|The [[pencil]] is one of the most basic graphic design tools.]]

Aside from technology, graphic design requires [[judgment]] and [[creativity]]. Critical, observational, quantitative and analytic thinking are required for design layouts and [[artistic rendering|rendering]]. If the executor is merely following a solution (e.g. sketch, script or instructions) provided by another designer (such as an [[art director]]), then the executor is not usually considered the designer.

==Tools==
The method of presentation (e.g. Arrangements, style, medium) is important to the design. The development and presentation tools can change how an audience perceives a project. The image or layout is produced using [[media (arts)|traditional media]] and [[technical drawing tools|guides]], or [[digital image editing]] tools on computers. Tools in [[computer graphics]] often take on traditional names such as "scissors" or "[[pen]]". Some graphic design tools such as a [[Grid (graphic design)|grid]] are used in both traditional and digital form.

In the mid-1980s [[desktop publishing]] and [[graphic art software]] applications introduced computer image manipulation and creation capabilities that had previously been manually executed. Computers enabled designers to instantly see the effects of layout or typographic changes, and to simulate the effects of traditional media. Traditional tools such as [[pencil]]s can be useful even when computers are used for finalization; a designer or art director may sketch numerous concepts as part of the [[creative process]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacci Howard Bear, [http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle desktoppub.about.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206171848/http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/basic/a/thumbnails.htm?terms=squiggle |date=2013-12-06 }} Retrieved 2008-03-19&lt;/ref&gt; Styluses can be used with tablet computers to capture hand drawings digitally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6986303 Milton Glaser Draws &amp; Lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321100020/http://vimeo.com/6986303 |date=2014-03-21 }}. retrieved 31-01-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computers and software===
Designers disagree whether computers enhance the creative process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html Designtalkboard.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629214914/http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1030.0.html |date=2007-06-29 }}, topic 1030 and [http://www.designtalkboard.com/designtalk/index.php/topic,1441.msg6356.html#msg6356 Designtalkboard.com], topic 1141. retrieved 3-18-2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some designers argue that computers allow them to explore multiple ideas quickly and in more detail than can be achieved by hand-rendering or [[paste up|paste-up]].&lt;ref&gt;Jann Lawrence Pollard and Jerry James Little, ''Creative Computer Tools for Artists: Using Software to Develop Drawings and Paintings,'' November 2001 Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; While other designers find the limitless choices from digital design can lead to paralysis or endless iterations with no clear outcome.

Most designers use a hybrid process that combines traditional and computer-based technologies. First, hand-rendered [[Comprehensive layout|layouts]] are used to get approval to execute an idea, then the polished visual product is produced on a computer.

Graphic designers are expected to be proficient in software programs for image-making, typography and layout. Nearly all of the popular and "industry standard" software programs used by graphic designers since the early 1990s are products of [[Adobe Systems]] Incorporated. [[Adobe Photoshop]] (a [[Raster scan|raster]]-based program for photo editing) and [[Adobe Illustrator]] (a vector-based program for drawing) are often used in the final stage. Designers often use pre-designed [[Raster graphics|raster images]] and [[vector graphics]] in their work from online design databases. Raster images may be edited in Adobe Photoshop, logos and illustrations in Adobe Illustrator, and the final product assembled in one of the major page layout programs, such as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[PagePlus|Serif PagePlus]] and [[QuarkXPress|QuarkXpress]]. Powerful open-source programs (which are free) are also used by both professionals and casual users for graphic design. These include [[Inkscape]] (for vector graphics), [[GIMP]] (for photo-editing and image manipulation), [[Krita]] (for painting) and [[Scribus]] (for page layout).

==Related design fields==
===Interface design===
{{Main article|User interface design}}
Since the advent of personal computers, many graphic designers have become involved in [[interface design]], in an environment commonly referred to as a [[Graphical user interface|Graphical User Interface]] (GUI). This has included [[web design]] and [[software design]], when [[end user]] [[interactivity]] is a design consideration of the layout or interface. Combining visual communication skills with an understanding of user interaction and online branding, graphic designers often work with [[software developer]]s and [[web developer]]s to create the [[look and feel]] of a web site or [[software application]]. An important aspect of interface design is [[icon design]].

===User experience design===
{{Main article|User experience design}}
User experience design is the study, analysis, and development of a person's interaction with a company or its products.

===Experiential graphic design===
{{Main article|Environmental Graphic Design}}

Experiential graphic design is the application of communication skills to the built environment. This area of graphic design requires practitioners to understand physical installations that have to be manufactured and withstand the same environmental conditions as buildings. As such, it is a cross-disciplinary collaborative process involving designers, fabricators, city planners, architects, manufacturers and construction teams.

Experiential graphic designers try to solve problems that people encounter while interacting with buildings and space. Examples of practice areas for environmental graphic designers are [[wayfinding]], [[placemaking]], branded environments, exhibitions and museum displays, public installations and digital environments.

==Occupations==
{{Main article|Graphic design occupations}}

Graphic design career paths cover all parts of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]] and often overlap. Workers perform specialized tasks, such as design services, publishing, advertising and public relations. As of 2017, median pay was $48,700 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm|title=Graphic Designers: Occupational Outlook Handbook: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bls.gov|archiveurl=|archivedate=|deadurl=no|access-date=2018-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main job titles within the industry are often country specific. They can include [[graphic designer]], art director, [[creative director]], [[animator]] and entry level [[production artist]]. Depending on the industry served, the responsibilities may have different titles such as "[[DTP associate|DTP Associate]]" or "[[Graphic Artist]]". The responsibilities may involve specialized skills such as [[illustration]], [[photography]], [[animation]] or [[interactive design]].

Employment in design of online projects was expected to increase by 35% by 2026, while employment in traditional media, such as newspaper and book design, expect to go down by 22%. Graphic designers will be expected to constantly learn new techniques, programs, and methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|title=Graphic Designers :     Occupational Outlook Handbook: :     U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-10-27|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027215647/https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-6|archivedate=2017-10-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graphic designers can work within companies devoted specifically to the industry, such as design consultancies or branding agencies, others may work within publishing, marketing or other communications companies. Especially since the introduction of personal computers, many graphic designers work as in-house designers in non-design oriented organizations.  Graphic designers may also work [[Freelancer|freelance]], working on their own terms, prices, ideas, etc.

A graphic designer typically reports to the [[art director]], [[creative director]] or [[senior media creative]]. As a designer becomes more senior, they spend less time designing and more time leading and directing other designers on broader creative activities, such as [[brand]] development and [[corporate identity]] development. They are often expected to interact more directly with clients, for example taking and interpreting briefs.

===Crowdsourcing in graphic design===
{{Main article|Crowdsourcing creative work}}
Jeff Howe of ''[[Wired Magazine]]'' first used the term "[[crowdsourcing]]" in his 2006 article, "The Rise of Crowdsourcing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Jeff|title=The Rise of Crowdsourcing|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&amp;topic=crowds&amp;topic_set=|publisher=WIRED Magazine|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209044356/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.06/crowds.html?pg=4&amp;topic=crowds&amp;topic_set=|archivedate=9 February 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gilmour|first=Julia|title=The Long History of Crowdsourcing – and Why You’re Just Now Hearing About It|url=http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|publisher=Crowdsource.com|accessdate=24 October 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140829172727/http://www.crowdsource.com/blog/2013/08/the-long-history-of-crowdsourcing-and-why-youre-just-now-hearing-about-it/|archivedate=29 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It spans such creative domains as graphic design, architecture, apparel design, writing, illustration etc. Tasks may be assigned to individuals or a group and may be categorized as convergent or divergent. An example of a divergent task is generating alternative designs for a poster. An example of a convergent task is selecting one poster design.

'''James McDougal Hart''' (May 10, 1828 &amp;ndash; October 24, 1901), was a [[Scotland|Scottish]]-born [[United States|American]] [[landscape art|landscape]] and cattle [[Painting|painter]] of the [[Hudson River School]].

==Family and education==
Hart was born in [[Kilmarnock]], [[Scotland]], and was taken to America with his family in early youth. His older brother, [[William Hart (painter)|William Hart]], was also a Hudson River School artist, as were his younger sister [[Julie Hart Beers]] and his two daughters, both figure painters, Letitia Bonnet Hart (1867 - Sept. 1953) and Mary Theresa Hart (1872–1942).

In [[Albany, New York]] he trained with a sign and carriage maker— possibly the same employer that had taken on his brother in his early career. James later returned to [[Europe]] for serious artistic training, studying in [[Munich]] and as a pupil of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schirmer]] at the [[Kunstakademie Düsseldorf]]. He is associated with the [[Düsseldorf school of painting]].

==Career==
Hart returned to America in 1853. He exhibited his first work at the [[National Academy of Design]] in 1848 and  became an associate in 1857 and a full member in 1859. He was particularly devoted to the National Academy, exhibiting there over a period of more than forty years and serving as vice president late in his life from 1895 to 1899. Like his brother William, James also exhibited at the Brooklyn Art Association (he lived for a time in Brooklyn) and at major exhibitions around the country.

Along with most of the major [[landscape art|landscape]] artists of the time, Hart based his operations in New York City and adopted the style of the [[Hudson River School]]. While he and his brother William often painted similar [[landscape art|landscape]] subjects, James may have been more inclined to paint exceptionally large works. An example is ''The Old Homestead'' (1862), 42 x 68&amp;nbsp;inches, in the collection of the [[High Museum of Art]] in Atlanta, Georgia. James may have been exposed to large paintings while studying in Düsseldorf, a center of realist art pedagogy that also shaped the practices of [[Albert Bierstadt]] and [[Worthington Whittredge]].

Like his brother William, James excelled at painting cattle. Kevin J. Avery writes, "the bovine subjects that once distinguished [his works] now seem the embodiment of Hart's artistic complacency." (p.&amp;nbsp;250 in ''American Drawings and Watercolors in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Volume I: A Catalogue of Works by Artists Born Before 1835'') In contrast with the complacency of some of his cattle scenes, his major [[landscape art|landscape]] paintings are considered important works of the Hudson River School. A particularly fine example is ''Summer in the Catskills'', now in the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]] in Madrid, Spain.

Among Hart's students was the Hudson River School painter [[Evelina Mount]].&lt;ref name=Black&gt;Black, M. ''American Paintings in the Detroit Institute of Arts: Works by Artists Born Before 1816'', vol. I. Detroit, Michigan, 1991, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Naylor&gt;Naylor, Natalie A. ''Women in Long Island's Past: A History of Eminent Ladies and Everyday Lives''. Charleston, S.C.: The History Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hart is interred at [[Green-Wood Cemetery]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]].

'''Joel-Peter Witkin''' (born September 13, 1939) is an American [[photographer]] who lives in [[Albuquerque]], [[New Mexico]]. His work often deals with  themes such as death, corpses (and sometimes dismembered portions thereof), and various outsiders such as [[dwarfism|people with dwarfism]], [[transgender]] and [[intersex]] persons, as well as physically deformed people. Witkin's complex [[tableau vivant|tableaux]] often recall religious episodes or classical paintings.&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"/&gt;

==Biography==
Witkin was born to a [[Jewish]] father and [[Roman Catholic]] mother. His twin brother, [[Jerome Witkin]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Witkin.html Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt; and son Kersen Witkin, are also painters. Witkin's parents divorced when he was young because they were unable to overcome their religious differences{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. He attended grammar school at Saint Cecelia's in Brooklyn and went on to [[Grover Cleveland High School (New York City)|Grover Cleveland High School]]. In 1961 Witkin enlisted in the United States Army with the intention of capturing war photography during the [[Vietnam war]]. However, due to scheduling conflicts, Witkin never saw combat in Vietnam. Witkin spent his military time at Fort Hood, Texas, and was mostly in charge of Public Information and classified photos.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PtylzIiMJN0]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, he became the official photographer for City Walls Inc. He attended [[Cooper Union]] in New York, where he studied [[sculpture]], attaining a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1974.  [[Columbia University]] granted him a scholarship for graduate school, but his Master of Fine Arts degree is from the [[University of New Mexico]] in [[Albuquerque]]
.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ethertongallery.com/html/artist_detail.php?recordID=10&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences and themes ==
Witkin claims that his vision and sensibility spring from an episode he witnessed as a young child, an automobile accident in front of his house in which a little girl was [[decapitation|decapitated]].

{{quote|It happened on a Sunday when my mother was escorting my twin brother and me down the steps of the tenement where we lived. We were going to church. While walking down the hallway to the entrance of the building, we heard an incredible crash mixed with screaming and cries for help. The accident involved three cars, all with families in them. Somehow, in the confusion, I was no longer holding my mother's hand. At the place where I stood at the curb, I could see something rolling from one of the overturned cars. It stopped at the curb where I stood. It was the head of a little girl. I bent down to touch the face, to speak to it -- but before I could touch it someone carried me away&lt;ref name="renegadeartists"&gt;{{cite web

He says his family's difficulties also influenced his work. His favorite artist is [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]]. His [[photography|photographic]] techniques draw on early [[Daguerreotypes]] and on the work of [[E. J. Bellocq]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/JPWitkin.html Jewish Virtual Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Those of Witkin's works which use corpses have had to be created in Mexico in order to get around restrictive US laws. Because of the [[Transgressive art|transgressive]] nature of the contents of his images, his works have been labelled [[wikt:exploitation|exploitative]] and have sometimes [[shock value|shocked]] public opinion.&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"/&gt;

His techniques include scratching the [[Negative (photography)|negative]], bleaching or toning the print, and using a hands-in-the-chemicals printing technique. This experimentation began after seeing a 19th-century [[ambrotype]] of a woman and her ex-lover who had been scratched from the frame.&lt;ref name="Jewish Virtual Library"/&gt;

Joel-Peter Witkin's photograph "Sanitarium" inspired the final presentation of Alexander McQueen's Spring/Summer 2001 collection based on avian imagery, the walls of another box within the faux psychiatric ward collapsed to reveal a startling tableau vivant: a reclining, masked nude breathing through a tube and surrounded by fluttering moths.

== Documentary ==
In July 2011, filming began on the feature-length documentary, [[Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye]].  The film, directed by Thomas Marino, examines Witkin's life and photographs.  Along with interviews with Joel-Peter Witkin, the film features interviews from gallery owners, prominent artists, photographers, and scholars who share insight into the impact of Witkin's work and influence on modern culture.  Filming took place in [[Albuquerque]], [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Paris]].  The film was released on July 6, 2013 for digital download and streaming/rental.  The film will be part of the permanent collections at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]] in Paris, France, and the [[Biblioteca Nacional de Chile]] in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyclopsblog.com/2011/12/02/joel-peter-witkin-an-objective-eye/ Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2326626/ Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye (2013) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Joel-Peter Witkin: An Objective Eye" was first publicly shown in Santiago, Chile at the Biblioteca Nacional de Chile on July 31, 2013, as part of the opening of the exhibition, "Vanitas: Joel-Peter Witkin en Chile".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mnba.cl/Vistas_Publicas/publicNoticias/noticiasPublicDetalle.aspx?idNoticia=43563] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130812024853/http://www.mnba.cl/Vistas_Publicas/publicNoticias/noticiasPublicDetalle.aspx?idNoticia=43563 |date=August 12, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those in attendance of this premiere included Joel-Peter Witkin, his wife Barbara, and gallery owner Baudoin Lebon.

Suzanne Valadon's ''Joy of Life'' depicts a landscape with four [[Nude (art)|nude]] and seminude women who are watched by a nude man.&lt;ref name=Perry&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVOPnrEcKKsC&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=%22charlotte%20du%20val%20d'ognes%22&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;q=%22charlotte%20du%20val%20d'ognes%22&amp;f=false|title=Concise Dictionary of Women Artists|last=Perry|first=Gill|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|editor-last=Gaze|editor-first=Delia|location=New York|pages=669|chapter=Valadon, Suzanne}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nude male was modeled by Valadon's lover, [[André Utter]].&lt;ref name=Faxon&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vxXAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;ots=cYBO5--VEQ&amp;dq=%22La%20Joie%20de%20vivre%22%20valadon&amp;pg=PA531#v=onepage&amp;q=%22La%20Joie%20de%20vivre%22%20valadon&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Artist's Models|last=Faxon|first=Alicia Craig|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=2001|editor-last=Jiminez|editor-first=Jill Berk|location=London|pages=529-531|chapter=Utter, Andre}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met through her son, [[Maurice Utrillo]], and Utter modeled nude for several of Valadon's paintings, including ''Adam and Eve'' (1909) and ''Casting the Net'' (1914).&lt;ref name=Faxon/&gt;
 
''Joy of Life'' is based on the theme of "women as nature," a typical subject at the time.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; [[Gill Perry]] has argued that the painting reworks the theme of bathers in [[nature]].&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt; She notes that the women "seem strangely separate from each other, the male viewer and from the nature that surrounds them," which suggests a "more ambiguous, dislocated relationship with both nature and the male spectator."&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt; Perry's reading is echoed by Patricia Mathews, who has described the figures as being ''in'' nature, but not ''equivalent'' to nature.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; She suggests that the male viewer "has no other role in the painting except as this near-caricature of the dominating [[male gaze]]," as the women are unaware of being watched.&lt;ref name=Mathews&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zUe_iyI2EfUC&amp;lpg=PA199&amp;dq=%22joy%20of%20life%22%20valadon&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q=%22joy%20of%20life%22%20valadon&amp;f=false|title=Passionate Discontent: Creativity, Gender, and French Symbolist Art|last=Mathews|first=Patricia Townley|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1999|location=Chicago|pages=199-202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rosemary Betterton]] has argued that the figures disrupt the male gaze and are, in fact, being caught in a moment without being [[Sexualization|sexualized]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; According to Mathews, the painting does not offer the "coherent narrative that so clearly dominated [[Masculism|masculinist]] images."&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; Valadon's ''Joy of Life'', Mathews has noted, is consistent with the ways in which "various narratives intersect in her work in often uncomfortable ways to dislodge and destabilize conventional gendered interpretations."&lt;ref name=Mathews/&gt; In ''Casting the Net'', completed three years later, Valadon actually reversed the traditional active male/passive female concept by casting the nude male in the role of object.&lt;ref name=Diamand&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamand-Rosinsky|first=Thérèse|title=Suzanne Valadon|chapter=Les multiples de Suzanne Valadon: Marie-Clémentine, «Biqui», ou «Terrible Maria»?|editor-last=Marchesseau|editor-first=Daniel|location=Martigny, Switzerland|publisher=Fondation Pierre Gianadda|date=1996|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kerameikos steles''' are a collection of sculptures used as grave-markers ([[steles]], sing. stele) in the [[Kerameikos]] necropolis of Attica. [[Kerameikos]] is located outside the [[Themistoclean Wall]]'s [[Dipylon Gate]]. Stelai come in various shapes/designs and depict images varying from pottery to narrative scenes. They were often marble or limestone, and were carved or sculpted to depict the person being memorialized sometimes with relatives or slaves. Reliefs decorating the graves were meant to show the dead in their best light, using imagery to recognize their bravery in battle, or pathos, or wealth. These monuments marked the graves of Athenian men, fallen warriors, as well as non-citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Hook|first=LaRue|date=1932|title=On the Lacedaemonians Buried in the Kerameikos|jstor=498389|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=36|issue=3|pages=290–292|doi=10.2307/498389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women were also included in Kerameikos but typically it was the wealthiest or prominent women who were given stele.&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Lord Smithson|Smithson, E.]] (1968). The Tomb of a Rich Athenian Lady, CA. 850 B.C. ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens,'' ''37''(1), 77-116. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/147539&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In many vase paintings of grave scenes wreaths are seen resting at the base of stele. This was likely a popular way to adorn the graves of Greek loved ones.

== History ==
The first steles were dated from the [[Early Bronze Age]], around 2000 B.C. The use of steles as grave markers gained popularity in Kerameikos around the [[Geometric art|Protogeometric period]] c.a. 950 B.C.E. until they fell out of style around the 8th century C.E.&lt;ref&gt;Blegen, C. (1952). Two Athenian Grave Groups of about 900 B.C. ''Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens,'' ''21''(4), 279-294. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org.proxy.wm.edu/stable/146860&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The site was first excavated in 1870 by German archaeologists looking for grave-goods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexandridou|first=Alexandra|date=2016|title=Funerary Variability in Late Eighth-Century B.C.E.

Many graves and buildings had been destroyed so they were used as building material.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, L. (1962). The Inscribed Gravestones of Archaic Attica. ''The Annual of the British School at Athens,'' ''57'', 115-153. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/30104502&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles ==
[[File:Dexileos.JPG|left|300x300px|thumb|Grave Stele of Dexileos]]
Athenians used Kerameikos for centuries to bury their dead. Over time different styles were introduced so there is a great variety of graves that came from Kerameikos. Notable styles found in Kerameikos include the naiskos stele, lekythos graves, and kore.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, L. (1962). The Inscribed Gravestones of Archaic Attica. ''The Annual of the British School at Athens,'' ''57'', 115-153. Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.jstor.org/stable/30104502&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves were inscribed with the name of the deceased and where they came from.

Some steles at Kerameikos used a style known as [[naiskos]] ("small temple"), which looks like a temple with columns and a pediment at the top. This particular symbol of wealth gained popularity in the 5th century B.C. examples include the [[Grave Stele of Dexileos]] and the [[Grave Stele of Hegeso]].

== Notable burials and graves ==
After the Battle of Chairon and Thibrachos, [[Lacedaemonian]] soldiers of [[Pausanias of Sparta|King Pausanias]]' army were buried at Kerameikos. The tomb was found marked by a marble plinth with Lacedaemonian inscriptions of the names of the men.&lt;ref&gt;Van Hook, L. (1932). On the Lacedaemonians Buried in the Kerameikos. ''American Journal of Archaeology,'' ''36''(3), 290-292. doi:10.2307/498389&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Terracotta lekythos (oil flask) MET 835.jpg|thumb|346x346px|Lekythos vase depicting a woman visiting a stele grave and carrying with an offering for the gods. Note the wreath decoration.]]
The [[Grave Stele of Hegeso]] is one of the best-preserved surviving attic stele and features a woman seated by her servant. This grave is a naiskos, meaning Hegeso was likely a prominent woman as this style signified wealth and importance.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, L.M.W. (1905). ''A History of Ancient Sculpture''. New York: Dodd, Mead, &amp; Co. pp. 499–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locations ==
Today the Kerameikos grave monuments can be found at the [[Kerameikos Archaeological Museum]] where many of them are preserved and kept on display.

'''Kuchi-e''' are [[Book frontispiece|frontispieces]] of books, especially woodblock printed fronticpieces for Japanese romance novels and literary magazines published from the 1890s to the 1910s.&lt;ref&gt;Newland, Amy Reigle. (2005). ''Hotei Encyclopedia of Japanese Woodblock Prints.''  Amsterdam: Hotei, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

They usually portrayed women and were bounded into the book's spine or inserted into literary magazines to give readers a sense of what type of stories were to unfold.  Most '''Kuchi-e''' were [[Woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]] in romance novels intended for a female audience.  However, some were [[Lithography|lithographs]], and some were inserted into other types of literature.  Most measured either 22 x 30&amp;nbsp;cm or 14 x 20&amp;nbsp;cm, the former being folded in thirds, and the latter being folded in half.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/kuchi-e.asp  Artlino]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the '''kuchi-e''' by [[Mizuno Toshikata]], note the two horizontal fold lines and the margin on top for binding.  Artists who designed '''kuchi-e''' include [[Hirezaki Eiho]], [[Ikeda Shoen]], [[Kaburagi Kiyokata]], [[Kajita Hanko]], [[Mishima Shoso]], [[Mizuno Toshikata]], [[Odake Kokkan]], [[Ogata Gekko]], [[Suzuki Kason]], [[Takeuchi Keishu]], [[Terasaki Kogyo]], [[Tomioka Eisen]], [[Tsutsui Toshimine]], [[Utagawa Kunimatsu]], [[Watanabe Seitei]], and [[Yamada Keichu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oberlin.edu/staff/fzwegat/ Oberlin College website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artelino.com/articles/kuchi-e.asp  Artlino]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation==
The word "kuchi-e" (口絵) is usually translated into English as mouth (kuchi) picture (e).&lt;ref&gt;Newland, Amy Reigle. (2005). ''Hotei Encyclopedia of Japanese Woodblock Prints.''  Amsterdam: Hotei, p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "kuchi" (口) may also mean opening, as it does in the compound words iri-guchi 入口 (entrance) and de-guchi 出口 (exit).  In this way, the translation "entrance picture" more clearly communicates the intended function of a kuchi-e as a frontispiece in a literary work.&lt;ref&gt;Personal communication with Stephen Salel, Robert F. Lange Foundation Assistant Curator of Japanese Art, Honolulu Museum of Art&lt;/ref&gt;

By a lot of people, the term '''[[Brick Gothic]]''' is used for what more specifically is called  '''Baltic Brick Gothic''' or '''North German Brick Gothic'''. That part of [[Gothic architecture]], widespread in [[Northern Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Poland]] and the [[Baltic states]], is commonly identified with the sphere of influence of the [[Hanseatic League]]. But there is a continuous mega-region of Gothic brick architecture, or '''Brick Gothic''' in a sense based on the facts, from the [[Strait of Dover]] to [[Finland]] and [[Lake Peipus]] and to the Sub[[Carpathian Mountains|carpathian]] region of southeastern [[Poland]] and southwestern [[Ukraine]].

Out of northern Germany and the Baltic region, the term "Brick Gothic" is adequately applied as well.&lt;ref&gt;[https://inventaris.onroerenderfgoed.be/erfgoedobjecten/31213 Official Flemish portal on architectural heritage – on churches in Poperinge, "Baksteengotiek van de kuststreek" (Brick Gothic of the coastal region) in Flanders]&lt;br /&gt;[https://cultureelerfgoed.nl/monumenten/25809 Official Dutch portal on architectural heritage – on a village church, "markant stuk baksteengotiek" (striking example of Brick Gothic) in the Netherlands]&lt;br /&gt;[https://www.schnell-und-steiner.de/artikel_6467.ahtml Book on a Bavarian brick church "eines der bedeutendsten Werke der Backsteingotik in Bayern" (one of the most important works of Brick Gothic in Bavaria)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The region around the Baltic Sea, including Northern Germany, has some typical characteristics, but there are also regional and social differences, such as between the churches of medieval big cities and those of the neighbouring villages. On the other hand, a significant number of Gothic brick buildings erected near the Baltic Sea could also have been built in the [[Netherlands]] or in [[Flanders]], and vice versa.

Furthermore, Gothic brick structures have also been erected in other regions, such as northern Italy, southwestern and central France, and in the [[Danube|Danubian]] area of southern Germany. The particular architectural styles of some regions differ very much from the others, these are Italian Gothic (with [[Lombard Gothic]], [[Venice|Venetian]] Gothic and [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] Gothic), French [[Gothique Méridional]]. Quite late began the medieval use of brick in England, with the [[Tudor Style]].

The true extent of northern  Brick Gothic and  other Gothic brick architecture is shown by this almost complete list.

This list will never be complete. But it aims to be almost complete to give an unbiased survey as well on the variance as on the geography of Gothic brick buildings.

The dates given here refer to the present extant Gothic structures. Predecessors or post-Gothic alterations are not normally mentioned, but can be assessed by following up the literature. The most influential structures are indicated by bold print. Romanesque and Renaissance structures are not listed. Gothic Brick structures from outside the Baltic or North German regions, e.g. the [[Danube|Danubian]] ones, are also included, while [[Neogothic]] edifices are not listed.

Most of the Gothic brick architecture in Belgium can be found in [[West Flanders]], some in a narrow strip along the border with the Netherlands. Many Gothic brick churches in the Province of [[Limburg (Belgium)|Limburg]] have been lost in the 19th century, as they were displaced by Gothic Revival churches.

Background informations:
* NM-DK = Digitized pages, available on the websites of the '''N'''ational '''M'''useum, of the compendium of'' '''D'''anmarks '''K'''irker'' ("Churches of Denmark"). It has been published since 1927, but the digitized pages mostly are of editions of the 1990s. On the linked subpage, you have to cklick for a PDF with the title "… Kirke". The description you load down begins with some history. After that, the chuchyard is described and after the churchyard, mostly beginning with the headline "BYGNING", the church building itself. In this list, sometimes simply is written "PDF", sometimes an identification of the volume and the number "BYGNING"-page. 
* Trap = ''Statistik-Topographisk Beskrivelse af Kongeriket Danmark'' (Statistical-Topographical Desrciption of the Kingdom of Denmark, initiated by Jens Peter '''Trap''' [[:da:J.P. Trap|&lt;small&gt;'''(DA)'''&lt;/small&gt;]] and continued by H. Weitemeyer, V. Falbe-Hansen &amp; H. Westergaard.

''See [[List of Gothic brick buildings in Germany]]''

===[[Hungary]]===
– In Hungary, there is much more hidden than visible medieval brick. During the 145 years of [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] occupation, many churches fell in ruins. At about 1700 they were restored, inclusively of plastering, which need not necessary have existed before. In ruins of the Turkish wars and of World War II, brick can be visible, though these buildings had been plastered in their time of function. –

'''Mickler's Floridiana''' was a bookseller in Florida started by '''Thomas Mickler''' and '''Georgine Mickler'''. The couple also ran '''Mickler House''', a small publisher, from their [[Chuluota]], [[Florida]] home. They had the largest collection of books on Florida subjects ([[Floridiana]]).&lt;ref name=sent&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1998-02-05/news/9802050212_1_georgine-love-of-books-chuluota The Micklers Lived For Books, Giving] OUR COUNTY February 5, 1998 by Don Boyett, Seminole County Editor Orlando Sentinel&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Mickler's sermon collection now resides at the [[University of Central Florida]] Library as the "Thomas and Georgine Mickler Sermon Collection 1880-1933."&lt;ref name=lib&gt;[http://digitool.fcla.edu/R/4DEIRQQ394BQSEPR9B1TMFSJ592ESS3919YLU89NINLT951D7E-01969?func=results-full Guide to the Thomas and Georgine Mickler Sermon Collection], 1880-1933 University of Central Florida Libraries&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Mickler was also an avid map collector.

Georgine Mickler was born in [[Chicago]]. She was raised by an aunt in [[Kentucky]] and had a hardscrabble life during the [[Great Depression]]. Her mother died when she was young. Her father, [[George Rumrill]], was a famous potter in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=sent/&gt; She was a photo illustrator in [[New York City]] and her work included photographs [[Jacqueline Bouvier]] (Jackie Kennedy).&lt;ref name=sent/&gt; She moved to Florida in 1961.&lt;ref name=lib/&gt; Thomas Mickler had a camera store in Orlando where the two met and fell in love. She established a part of the store for books and it grew.

Gov. [[Lawton Chiles]] visited. They also helped build St. [[Joseph's Catholic Church (Alafaya Trail)]].&lt;ref name=sent/&gt;

The Mickler's did mail-order business as '''Mickler's Antiquarian Books''' for almost 40 years. They were skilled in obtaining out-of-print publications about Florida and collected more than 40,000 books and other historical pieces of paper memorabilia (known as ephemera,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ephemera]]&lt;/ref&gt; in the trade).&lt;ref name=lib/&gt;

[[File:A Mind Map on ICT and Pedagogy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|A mind map about educational technology]]
{{InfoMaps}}
A '''mind map''' is a  [[diagram]] used to visually organize information. A mind map is hierarchical and shows relationships among pieces of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn H. Hopper, Practicing College Learning Strategies, 7th Edition, {{ISBN|9781305109599}}, Ch. 7&lt;/ref&gt; It is often created around a single concept, drawn as an image in the center of a blank page, to which associated representations of ideas such as images, words and parts of words are added. Major ideas are connected directly to the central concept, and other ideas branch out from those major ideas.

Mind maps can also be drawn by hand, either as "rough notes" during a lecture, meeting or planning session, for example, or as higher quality pictures when more time is available. Mind maps are considered to be a type of [[spider diagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/mind-map?q=mind+map |title=Mind Map noun - definition in the British English Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus - Cambridge Dictionaries Online |publisher=Dictionary.cambridge.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar concept in the 1970s was "idea [[sunburst chart|sun bursting]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/mindmapping-learning-study-memory/who-invented-mind-mapping.html |title=Who invented mind mapping |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}
Although the term "mind map" was first popularized by British [[popular psychology]] author and television personality [[Tony Buzan]], the use of diagrams that visually "map" information using branching and [[Radial tree|radial maps]] traces back centuries. These pictorial methods record knowledge and model systems, and have a long history in learning, [[brainstorming]], [[memory]], [[visual thinking]], and [[problem solving]] by educators, engineers, psychologists, and others. Some of the earliest examples of such graphical records were developed by [[Porphyry of Tyros]], a noted thinker of the 3rd century, as he graphically visualized the concept [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories of Aristotle]]. Philosopher [[Ramon Llull]] (1235–1315) also used such techniques.

The [[semantic network]] was developed in the late 1950s as a theory to understand human learning and developed further by [[Allan M. Collins]] and M. Ross Quillian during the early 1960s. Mind maps are similar in radial structure to [[concept map]]s, developed by learning experts in the 1970s, but differ in that the former are simplified by focusing around a single central key concept.

== Popularisation of the term "mind map" ==

Buzan's specific approach, and the introduction of the term "mind map", arose during a 1974 [[BBC]] TV series he hosted, called ''Use Your Head''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mind-mapping.org/blog/mapping-history/roots-of-visual-mapping/ |title=Roots of visual mapping - The mind-mapping.org Blog |publisher=Mind-mapping.org |date=2004-05-23 |accessdate=2013-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buzan|first=Tony |date=1974 |title=Use Your Head |location=London|publisher=BBC Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this show, and companion book series, Buzan promoted his conception of radial tree, diagramming key words in a colorful, radiant, tree-like structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |title=Buzan claims mind mapping his invention in interview |website=KnowledgeBoard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213000356/http://www.knowledgeboard.com/item/2980 |archive-date=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buzan says the idea was inspired by [[Alfred Korzybski]]'s [[general semantics]] as popularized in science fiction novels, such as those of [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[A. E. van Vogt]]. He argues that while "traditional" outlines force readers to scan left to right and top to bottom, readers actually tend to scan the entire page in a non-linear fashion. Buzan's treatment also uses then-popular assumptions about the functions of [[cerebral hemispheres]] in order to explain the claimed increased effectiveness of mind mapping over other forms of note making.

==Mind map guidelines==
Buzan suggests the following guidelines for creating mind maps:

# Start in the center with an image of the topic, using at least 3 colors.
# Use images, symbols, codes, and dimensions throughout your mind map.
# Select key words and print using upper or lower case letters.
# Each word/image is best alone and sitting on its own line.
# The lines should be connected, starting from the central image. The lines become thinner as they radiate out from the center.
# Make the lines the same length as the word/image they support.
# Use multiple colors throughout the mind map, for visual stimulation and also for encoding or grouping.
# Develop your own personal style of mind mapping.
# Use emphasis and show associations in your mind map.
# Keep the mind map clear by using radial hierarchy or outlines to embrace your branches.

== Uses ==

[[File:Mindmap.gif|thumb|Rough mindmap notes taken during a course session]]
As with other diagramming tools, mind maps can be used to [[generation|generate]], [[creative visualization|visualize]], [[structure]], and [[taxonomic classification|classify]] ideas, and as an aid to [[study skills|studying]]&lt;ref&gt;'Mind maps as active learning tools', by Willis, CL. Journal of computing sciences in colleges. {{ISSN|1937-4771}}. 2006. Volume:
21 Issue: 4&lt;/ref&gt; and [[organization|organizing]] information, [[problem solving|solving problems]], [[decision making|making decisions]], and writing.

Mind maps have many applications in personal, family, [[education]]al, and [[business]] situations, including [[notetaking]], brainstorming (wherein ideas are inserted into the map radially around the center node, without the implicit prioritization that comes from hierarchy or sequential arrangements, and wherein grouping and organizing is reserved for later stages), summarizing, as a [[mnemonic technique]], or to sort out a complicated idea. Mind maps are also promoted as a way to collaborate in color pen creativity sessions.

In addition to these direct use cases, data retrieved from mind maps can be used to enhance several other applications; for instance [[expert system|expert search systems]], [[search engine]]s and search and tag query recommender.&lt;ref name=Beel2009&gt;{{Cite book | first=Jöran | last=Beel | first2=Bela| last2=Gipp | first3=Jan-Olaf |last3= Stiller | chapter=Information Retrieval On Mind Maps - What Could It Be Good For? |url=http://www.sciplore.org/publications_en.php | title=Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Collaborative Computing: Networking, Applications and Worksharing (CollaborateCom'09) | year=2009 | publisher=IEEE | place=Washington }}&lt;/ref&gt; To do so, mind maps can be analysed with classic methods of [[information retrieval]] to classify a mind map's author or documents that are linked from within the mind map.&lt;ref name=Beel2009 /&gt;

==Differences from other visualizations==

* ''Concept maps'': Mind maps differ from [[concept maps]] in that mind maps focus on ''only'' one word or idea, whereas concept maps connect multiple words or ideas. Also, concept maps typically have text labels on their connecting lines/arms. Mind maps are based on radial hierarchies and [[tree structure]]s denoting relationships with a central governing concept, whereas concept maps are based on connections between concepts in more diverse patterns.  However, either can be part of a larger [[personal knowledge base]] system.
* ''Modelling graphs'': There is no rigorous right or wrong with mind maps, relying on the arbitrariness of [[mnemonic]] systems. A [[UML diagram]] or a [[semantic network]] has structured elements modelling relationships, with lines connecting objects to indicate relationship. This is generally done in black and white with a clear and agreed iconography. Mind maps serve a different purpose: they help with memory and organization. Mind maps are collections of words structured by the mental context of the author with visual mnemonics, and, through the use of colour, icons and visual links, are informal and necessary to the proper functioning of the mind map.

==Research==

===Effectiveness===
Cunningham (2005) conducted a user study in which 80% of the students thought "mindmapping helped them understand concepts and ideas in science".&lt;ref name="Cunningham05"&gt;{{cite thesis| type=Ph.D.| author=Glennis Edge Cunningham| title=Mindmapping: Its Effects on Student Achievement in High School Biology| year=2005| publisher=The University of Texas at Austin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies also report some subjective positive effects on the use of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Holland2004"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Brian Holland, Lynda Holland, Jenny Davies| title=An investigation into the concept of mind mapping and the use of mind mapping software to support and improve student academic performance| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antoni2006"&gt;{{cite journal| author=D'Antoni, A.V., Zipp, G.P.| title=Applications of the Mind Map Learning Technique in Chiropractic Education: A Pilot Study and Literature| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive opinions on their effectiveness, however, were much more prominent among students of art and design than in students of computer and information technology, with 62.5% vs 34% (respectively) agreeing that they were able to understand concepts better with mind mapping software&lt;ref name="Holland2004" /&gt;. Farrand, Hussain, and Hennessy (2002) found that [[spider diagram]]s (similar to concept maps) had limited, but significant, impact on memory recall in undergraduate students (a 10% increase over baseline for a 600-word text only) as compared to preferred study methods (a 6% increase over baseline).&lt;ref name= Farrand2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Farrand, P. |author2=Hussain, F. |author3=Hennessy, E.  |year=2002 |title=The efficacy of the mind map study technique |journal=Medical Education |volume=36 |issue=5 |pages=426–431 |url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/118952400/abstract |accessdate=2009-02-16 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2923.2002.01205.x |pmid=12028392}}&lt;/ref&gt; This improvement was only robust after a week for those in the diagram group and there was a significant decrease in motivation compared to the subjects' preferred methods of note taking. A meta study about [[concept map]]ping concluded that concept mapping is more effective than "reading text passages, attending lectures, and participating in class discussions".&lt;ref name="Nesbit06"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Nesbit, J.C., Adesope, O.O.| title=Learning with concept and knowledge maps: A meta-analysis| journal=Review of Educational Research| year=2006| volume=76| number=3| pages=413| publisher=Sage Publications| doi=10.3102/00346543076003413}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same study also concluded that concept mapping is slightly more effective "than other constructive activities such as writing summaries and outlines". However, results were inconsistent, with the authors noting "significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets". In addition, they concluded that low-ability students may benefit more from mind mapping than high-ability students.

===Features of mind maps===
Joeran Beel and Stefan Langer conducted a comprehensive analysis of the content of mind maps.&lt;ref name="Beel2011d"&gt;{{cite book| author=Joeran Beel, Stefan Langer| chapter=An Exploratory Analysis of Mind Maps| title=Proceedings of the 11th ACM Symposium on Document Engineering (DocEng'11)| year=2011| publisher=ACM| url=http://docear.org/papers/An%20Exploratory%20Analysis%20of%20Mind%20Maps%20--%20preprint.pdf | accessdate=1 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They analysed 19,379 mind maps from 11,179 users of the mind mapping applications SciPlore MindMapping (now Docear) and [[MindMeister]]. Results include that average users create only a few mind maps (mean=2.7), average mind maps are rather small (31 nodes) with each node containing about three words (median). However, there were exceptions. One user created more than 200 mind maps, the largest mind map consisted of more than 50,000 nodes and the largest node contained ~7,500 words. The study also showed that between different mind mapping applications (Docear vs MindMeister) significant differences exist related to how users create mind maps.

===Automatic creation of mind maps===
There have been some attempts to create mind maps automatically. Brucks &amp; Schommer created mind maps automatically from full-text streams.&lt;ref name="Brucks2008"&gt;{{cite arxiv| author=Claudine Brucks, Christoph Schommer| title=Assembling Actor-based Mind-Maps from Text Stream| year=2008| arxiv=0810.4616}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rothenberger et al. extracted the main story of a text and presented it as mind map.&lt;ref name="Rothenberger2008"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Rothenberger, T, Oez, S, Tahirovic, E, Schommer, Christoph| title=Figuring out Actors in Text Streams: Using Collocations to establish Incremental Mind-maps| journal= | arxiv=0803.2856| year=2008| bibcode=2008arXiv0803.2856R}}&lt;/ref&gt; And there is a patent about automatically creating sub-topics in mind maps.&lt;ref name="Plotkin09"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2009|title=Software tool for creating outlines and mind maps that generates subtopics automatically|journal=USPTO Application: 20090119584|volume=|author=Robert Plotkin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
[[List of concept- and mind-mapping software|Mind-mapping software]] can be used to organize large amounts of information, combining spatial organization, dynamic hierarchical structuring and node folding. Software packages can extend the concept of mind-mapping by allowing individuals to map more than thoughts and ideas with information on their computers and the Internet, like spreadsheets, documents, Internet sites and images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdevin.com/top-10-totally-free-mind-mapping-software-tools/|title=Top 10 Totally Free Mind Mapping Software Tools|last=Santos|first=Devin|date=15 February 2013|publisher=IMDevin|accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that mind-mapping can improve learning/study efficiency up to 15% over conventional [[note-taking]].&lt;ref name="Farrand2002" /&gt;

A '''mood board''' is a type of [[collage]] consisting of images, text, and samples of objects in a composition. It can be based upon a set topic or can be any material chosen at random. A mood board can be used to give a general idea of a topic, or to show how different something is from the modern day.{{cn|date=October 2017}}{{or|date=October 2017}} They may be physical or digital, and can be effective presentation tools.&lt;ref name=wyatt&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Paul|title=How to create mood boards: 40 pro tips and tools|url=http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/mood-boards-812470|newspaper=Creative Bloq|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[Graphic designer]]s, [[interior designer]]s, [[industrial designer]]s, [[photographer]]s and other creative artists use mood boards to visually illustrate the style they wish to pursue. However, these boards can also be used by design professionals to visually explain a certain style of [[writing]], or an imaginary setting for a storyline. In short, mood boards are not limited to visual subjects, but serve as a visual tool to quickly inform others of the overall "feel" (or "flow") of an idea.{{cn|date=October 2017}} In creative processes, mood boards can balance coordination and creative freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Endrissat, N., Islam, G., &amp; Noppeney, C. (2015). Visual organizing: Balancing coordination and creative freedom via mood boards. Journal of Business Research. http://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2015.10.004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
Traditionally,{{whom|date=October 2017}}{{cn|date=October 2017}} mood boards are made from [[Foamcore|foam board]] which can be cut up with a [[scalpel]] and can also have spray mounted cut-outs put onto it.&lt;ref name=wyatt/&gt; Creating mood boards in a digital form may be easier and quicker,{{whom|date=October 2017}}{{cn|date=October 2017}} especially when it comes to collaboration or modification of projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual Representations: Mood Boards and Idea Sharing|url=http://www.impactpostersgallery.com/blog/visual-representations-mood-boards-and-idea-sharing/|publisher=Impact Posters Gallery|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but physical objects often tend to have a higher impact on people because of the more complete palette of sensations physical mood boards offer,{{or|date=October 2017}} in contrast with the digital mood boards. Mood boards can also be painted.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The '''Poetry Society''' is a membership organisation, open to all, whose stated aim is "to promote the study, use and enjoyment of poetry".

The Society was founded in London in February 1909 as the Poetry Recital Society, becoming the Poetry Society in 1912. Its first President was Lady [[Margaret Sackville]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.gov.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19090924.2.15 "Premiums for Poets"], ''Evening Post'', 24 September 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; 

From its current Covent Garden, London, premises, The Poetry Society publishes ''[[Poetry Review]]'', Britain's leading poetry magazine, which provides a forum for poems from both new and established poets. Its current Editor is the poet [[Emily Berry]], who succeeded [[Maurice Riordan]] in 2017. The magazine's editor from 2005 to 2012 was [[Fiona Sampson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/publications/review/ "Publications"], The Poetry Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Society organises several competitions, including the British [[National Poetry Competition]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/competitions/ |title=The Poetry Society (Competitions) |publisher=Poetry Society |accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Foyle Young Poets of the Year Award,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foyleyoungpoets.org Foyle Young Poets]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Popescu Prize]], The Ted Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry and the [[Geoffrey Dearmer Award]]. The society also ran the [[Alice Hunt Bartlett Prize]] from 1986 to 1997.

There is a '''Poetry Café''' on its Ground Floor, and performance space in the basement, rooms being available for hire.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7435">'''Psychoanalytic film theory''' is a school of academic thought that evokes of the concepts of psychoanalysts [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Jacques Lacan]]. The theory is closely tied to [[Critical theory]], [[Marxist film theory]], and [[Apparatus theory]]. 
The theory is separated into two waves. The First wave occurred in the 1960s and 70s. The second wave became popular in the 1980s and 90s.{{sfn|McGowan|2011}}

==Precursors==
At the end of the nineteenth century, psychoanalysis was created, and film happened to follow shortly afterward.{{sfn|Creed|1998|pp=1}} [[André Breton]], the founder of the [[Surrealist]] movement, saw film as a means of engaging the unconscious. Since films had the ability to tell a story using techniques such as superimposition, and slow motion, the Surrealists saw this as mimicking dreams.{{sfn|Creed|1998|pp=2}}

Early applications of psychoanalysis to cinema concentrated on unmasking latent meanings behind screen images, before moving on to a consideration of film as a representation of [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]].{{sfn|Lapsley and Westlake|1988|pp=67 and 91}} From there, a wider consideration of the [[Subject (philosophy)|subject position]] of the viewer led to wider engagements with critical theory - to psychoanalytic film theory proper.{{sfn|Lapsley and Westlake|1988|pp=92-95}}

Freud's concepts of the Oedipus complex, narcissism, castration, the unconscious, the return, and hysteria are all utilized in film theory.{{sfn|Creed|1998|pp=2}}
The 'unconscious' of a film are examined; this is known as [[subtext]].{{sfn|Creed|1998|pp=2-3}}

==Gaze==

In the early 1970s, [[Christian Metz (critic)|Christian Metz]] and [[Laura Mulvey]] separately explored aspects of the "[[gaze]]" in the cinema, Metz stressing the viewer's [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] with the camera's vision,&lt;ref&gt;Lapsley, p. 82-4&lt;/ref&gt; - an identification largely "constructed" by the film itself&lt;ref&gt;Childers, p. 173-4&lt;/ref&gt; - and Mulvey the [[Sexual fetishism|fetishistic]] aspects of (especially) the male viewer's regard for the onscreen female body.&lt;ref&gt;Lapsley, p. 77-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The viewing subject may be offered particular identifications (usually with a leading male character) from which to watch. The theory stresses the subject's longing for a completeness which the film may appear to offer through identification with an image, although Lacanian theory also indicates that identification with the image is never anything but an illusion and the subject is always split simply by virtue of coming into existence ([[aphanisis]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis'' (1994) p. 207-8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second wave==

A second wave of psychoanalytic film criticism associated with [[Jacqueline Rose]] emphasised the search for the missing [[Objet petit a|object of desire]] on the part of the spectator: in [[Elisabeth Cowie]]'s words, "the pleasure of fantasy lies in the setting out, not in the having of the objects".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Lapsley, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1990 onward the Matrixial theory of artist and  psychoanalyst [[Bracha L. Ettinger]]&lt;ref&gt; Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Borderspace'', University of Minnesota Press, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; revolutionized feminist film theory. Her concept [[The Matrixial Gaze]],&lt;ref&gt; Bracha L. Ettinger, ''The Matrixial Gaze''. Published by Leeds University, 1995. Reprinted in: ''Drawing Papers'', nº 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; that has established a feminine gaze and has articulated its differences from the phallic gaze and its relation to feminine as well as maternal specificities and potentialities of "coemergence", offering a critique of [[Sigmund Freud]]'s and [[Jacques Lacan]]'s psychoanalysis, is extensively used in analysis of films&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''After-effects - After-images''. Manchester University Press, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Maggie Humm, Feminism and Film''. Edinburgh University Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; by female authors, like [[Chantal Akerman]],&lt;ref&gt;Lucia Nagib and Anne Jerslev (ends.), ''Impure Cinema''. London: I.B.Tauris.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by male authors, like [[Pedro Almodovar]]&lt;ref&gt;Julian Daniel Gutierrez-Arbilla, ''Aesthetics, Ethics and Trauma in the Cinema of [[Pedro Almodovar]]''. Edinburgh University Press, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;. The matrixial gaze offers the female the position of a subject, not of an object, of the gaze, while deconstructing the structure of the subject itself, and offers border-time, border-space and a possibility for compassion and witnessing. Ettinger's notions articulate the links between aesthetics, ethics and trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Griselda Pollock, ''Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum: Time, Space and the Archive''. Rutledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[post-structuralism]] took an increasingly pragmatic approach to the possibilities Theory offered, so too [[Joan Copjec]] criticised early work around the gaze in the light of the work of [[Michel Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791286/obo-9780199791286-0052.xml Todd McGowan, 'Psychoanalytic Film Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; The role of [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] in cinematic representation came more to the fore,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199791286/obo-9780199791286-0052.xml McGowan]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lacanian analysis was seen to offer fertile ways of speaking of film rather than definitive answers or conclusive self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lapsley, p. 273-6&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5022">[[File:Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Front of a [[Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault|receiving vault in Marion, Ohio]], United States]]
A '''receiving vault''' or '''receiving tomb''',{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}} sometimes also known as a '''public vault''', is a structure designed to temporarily store dead bodies in winter months when the ground is too frozen to dig a permanent [[grave]] in a [[cemetery]]. Technological advancements in excavation, embalming, and refrigeration have rendered the receiving vault obsolete.

==About the receiving vault==

===Development and use===
The receiving vault came into use in parts of the world such as northern Europe, northern North America, and far southern South America, where frozen ground made it difficult or impossible to dig graves during the winter months. In such areas, the receiving vault was used to temporarily store bodies until warmer weather permitted digging.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}} Receiving vaults were also used as a temporary burial site while an elaborate [[mausoleum]] or under ground [[crypt]] was being constructed to house the remains. Occasionally they were used to temporarily bury the remains of an individual until a decision was made regarding a permanent place of burial, or until the family had the funds to arrange for a permanent place of burial.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=110}}

In times of epidemics, in which large numbers of people could die within days of one another, receiving vaults were often used to hold remains until such time as individual or mass graves could be dug.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=110}} Disease-bearing corpses were also often stored in the receiving vault until such time as authorities believed it was safe to handle them.{{sfn|Cook|2013|page=111}} Some cemeteries, however, barred the placement of diseased remains in the receiving vault for fear that the vault would become contaminated.{{sfn|Milano|2011|page=66}}{{sfn|Young|2003|page=96}}

Receiving vaults largely ceased to be built once powered digging equipment, such as the [[steam shovel]] and [[backhoe]], made it possible to dig graves in winter months.{{sfn|Young|2003|page=32}}

===Types of receiving vaults===
The receiving vault was most commonly seen from the 1800s into the early 1900s.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}} The earliest receiving vaults were simple underground chambers dug out of hills.  Where the ground was level, the receiving vault was dug into the earth, and a mound heaped over it to mimic a hill.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}}  Receiving vaults stored coffins or bodies in loculi, or shelves, set into the walls of the vault. The interiors were simple, and often plain, with heavy lockable doors to prevent entry by [[Grave robbery|grave robbers]] or [[Body snatching|body snatchers]].{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=108}}

Receiving vaults built from the mid-1800s onward could be either above-ground or below-ground, and ranged from the simple structure with [[Loculus (architecture)|loculi]] (wall niches) for coffins to beautifully decorated, large, and ornate structures. Some cemeteries co-located a [[chapel]] (either next to or above) with the receiving vault to make it easier to hold a funeral in conjunction with the vault's use. The cost of constructing and operating the receiving vault was usually borne by the cemetery. Receiving vaults were usually located toward the center or the rear of a cemetery.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=107}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Caparn|first=Harold A.|title=Modern Meditations Among the Tombs|newspaper=Landscape Architecture Magazine|date=July 1911|page=177|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r7lCAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22receiving%20vault%22%20cemetery&amp;pg=PA177#v=onepage&amp;q=%22receiving%20vault%22%20&amp;f=false|accessdate=September 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small cemeteries usually used a small, subterranean receiving vault, while larger burying grounds with more income built larger underground or above-ground structures.{{sfn|Veit|Nonestied|2008|page=108}}

'''Tel Kabri''' ({{lang-he-n|תֵל כַבְרִי}}; {{lang-ar|تَلْ ألْقَهوَة}}, Tell al-Qahweh, "the mound of coffee"{{sfnp|Khalidi|1992|p=28}}) is an [[archaeological]] site of a ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tell]]'' (hill city), containing one of the largest [[Bronze Age|Middle Bronze]] (MB) Age (2,100–1,550 BC) [[Canaan]]ite palaces in ancient Palestine,{{sfnp|Wiener|2013b}} and the largest such palace excavated as of 2014.{{sfnp|Koh|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2014}} Kabri is named for the abundance of its perennial [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] – as described in the [[#Etymology|Etymology]] section below – the presence of which has led to the site's occupation and use as a water source from the [[Neolithic#Neolithic 3 – Pottery Neolithic (PN)|Pottery Neolithic]] (PN) period (6,400–4,500 BC) to the present day.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=15}} Located in the Western [[Upper Galilee]], the site was at the height of its power in the MB, controlling much of the surrounding region. Kabri declined as a local power at the end of the MB, but the site continued to be occupied at times, on a much reduced level, up until the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].

Since 1957, Tel Kabri has been excavated by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] (IAA), formerly the Israel Department of Antiquities and Museums (IDAM), as well as Israeli and American universities.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|pp=839–841}} Among the discoveries at the site by the two full-scale archaeological expeditions,{{efn|1= [[#The Tel Kabri Expedition: 1986–1993|The Tel Kabri Expedition]] (1986–1993) and [[#The Tel Kabri Archaeological Project: 2005–ongoing|The Tel Kabri Archaeological Project]] (2005–ongoing) are discussed in detail later in the text.}}  two have attracted particular attention from the archaeological community. The first finding to come to international attention was the discovery of [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]]-style [[fresco]]es in the palace at Kabri.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|Goshen|2011|p=245}} {{as of|2015}}, these are the only Minoan-style frescoes ever discovered in Israel.{{sfnp|Science Daily|2009}} Second, in 2013, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project uncovered the oldest and largest known palatial [[wine cellar]] in the [[Ancient Near East]] in Kabri's palace.{{sfnp|Burrows|2013}}

==Etymology==
{{as of|2015}}, the original Canaanite name of Tel Kabri is unknown.{{efn|1= Tel Kabri, as the name suggests is a ''[[Tell (archaeology)|tel]]'', a type of mound found from the [[Balkans]] to the [[Punjab region|Punjab]] that is created as a result of the destruction of mudbrick from repeated different periods of occupation of a site.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|pp=21-22}}}} Aharon Kempinski hypothesised that Kabri might have been the same city as Rehov, referred to in the [[Execration Texts]], an [[Ancient Egypt]]ian list of enemy polities.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002b|p=452}} [[Amihai Mazar]] once believed that Tel Kabri – or the site of [[Rehov|Tel Rehov]] – might be the Rehov from the Execration Texts, or Tel Kabri might be a different Rehov mentioned in topographic lists by [[Pharaoh]] [[Thutmose III]].{{sfnp|Mazar|1999|p=4}} No definitive evidence has been found to support any of these hypotheses. By the [[Iron Age Levant|Iron Age]], 1200-500BC (IA), the site is known to have been called Rehov, and this continued into the [[Phoenicia#High point: 1200–800 BC|Phoenician]] period – a period of Phoenician dominance over the area, which was concurrent with the Iron Age.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}}

Early in the [[Phoenicia under Roman rule|Roman Period]] (64 BC–500s AD), the town of Kabrita had been established to the east of the tel.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}} The site is mentioned in the 3rd century [[Mosaic of Rehob]], as marking one of the northernmost bounds of Jewish resettlement after their return from [[Babylonian exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Raphael Frankel and [[Israel Finkelstein]], ''The Northwest Corner of Eretz-Israel in the Baraita ‘Boundaries of Eretz-Israel’'' Cathedra: For the History of Eretz Israel and its Yishuv (vol. 27), 1983, pp. 39–46. (See: {{cite journal |last=Finkelstein |first=Israel |title='The Northwest Corner of Eretz-Israel' in the Baraita 'Boundaries of Eretz-Israel' |journal=Cathedra: For the History of Eretz Israel and its Yishuv |volume=27 |issue= |pages=39–46 |jstor=23398920|date=1983|registration=yes }}).&lt;/ref&gt; Kabrita became the Arab village of el-Kabira, which by the late 1200s AD was called al-Kabrah by the Arabs and Le Quiebre by the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem#The Kingdom of Acre|Crusader]]s who controlled the area at the time. By 1880, both the village and the ruins on the tel had come to be associated and bear the same names.{{sfnp|Guérin|1880|p=32}} Al-Kabrah eventually became [[al-Kabri]],{{sfnp|Barag|1979|p=203}} and this name lasted until the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] when the village was depopulated.{{sfnp|Anon|1988|p=49}} Both the post-war kibbutz, [[Kabri, Israel|Kabri]], on whose grounds the archaeological site is located, and the tel itself, are named for al-Kabri.{{sfnp|Anon|1988|p=49}} The name of Kabrita, and the later names, were derived from the triconsonantal [[Semitic root#Triconsonantal roots|Semitic root]], כבר, meaning 'great or powerful', in reference to the plentiful water from Kabri's springs.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002b|p=452}}

==Geography==
Tel Kabri is at the eastern end of the Western Galilee coastal plain, located on the grounds of Kibbutz Kabri. It is less than {{convert|5|km|mi}} from the [[Mediterranean Sea|sea]], and the [[Ga'aton River]] is nearby to the south, with the closest major city being [[Nahariyya]] to the west. The [[Tell (archaeology)|tel]] is home to four springs, Ein Shefa, Ein Giah, Ein Tzuf, and Ein ha-Shayara.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=15}} It is these springs that have brought people to Kabri since the Neolithic.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=15}}

Natural resources such as trees on the hills to the east and stone quarries near the coast were important for the inhabitants of the site. Kabri's height is partly a result of human activity: Over the centuries, material remains created layers that built up thetel.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|pp=21-22}} During Kempinski's excavations, it was found that the original surface in the Neolithic would have been up to {{convert|5.5|m|ft}} lower than the present surface.{{sfnp|Horowitz|2002|p=8}}

==History==

The tel and its surrounding area have been inhabited since the [[Neolithic#Neolithic 3 .E2.80.93 Pottery Neolithic .28PN.29|Pottery Neolithic]] (PN).{{efn|1= 6,400–4,500 BC}}  Kabri was at the height of its power in the MB, when the polity there controlled a significant portion of the Upper Galilee. After the MB, Tel Kabri was occupied by later peoples – though on a much reduced scale – up to the founding of the State of Israel, when the kibbutz of Kabri was created.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}}

===Pre-Palatial===

The area of Kabri was first settled during the PN by members of the [[Yarmoukian]] culture.{{sfnp|Marder|al.|2002|p=305}} In the early [[Chalcolithic]] period (4500–3500 BC), Kabri was a major centre of the [[Wadi Raba]] culture. In the Early Bronze (EB) Age (3500-2100 BC), there was a town on the side of the tel that was destroyed as part of the region-wide [[societal collapse|systems collapse]] that characterised the EB collapse.{{efn|1= The Early Bronze Age collapse is the event that is traditionally used to mark the end of the EB and the beginning of MB. The "collapse" was an abrupt end to the material culture – such as pottery and architecture – that is identified with the EB civilisations of the [[Aegean Civilization|Aegean]], [[Bronze Age Anatolia#Early Bronze Age|Anatolia]] and the [[Bronze Age Levant#Bronze Age|Levant]] and the beginning of a period marked by the prevalence of so-called palatial society. {{As of|2015}} there is no accepted explanation for this sudden change.}}  In the early and middle MB I, Tel Kabri – along with [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Tel Afek|Aphek]], and [[Acre, Israel#Antiquity|Akko]] – was one of the earliest cities in the Levant to rebuild its fortifications following the EB collapse.{{sfnp|Kempinski|1992|p=127}} The new city was confined to the northern part of the earlier EB tel.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|p=70}}

===Palatial===

Prior to the ongoing excavations at Kabri that began in 2005,{{efn|1= {{as of|2015}}, excavations are ongoing.}}  archaeologists thought that there was only one palace at the site,{{efn|1= A palace that had been found by Aharon Kempinski during the [[#The Tel Kabri Expedition: 1986–1993|Tel Kabri Expedition of 1986–1993]].}}  and that it was built in the period between the late MB I (2200–1950 BC) and MB IIA (1950–1700 BC). It was also thought that the MB I period had been a transition phase. However, the palace found by Kempinski has been dated to the MB IIB (1700–1550 BC), and in 2010, a second, earlier, palace – an MB IIA palace{{efn|1= MB I and MB IIA are interchangeable terms. This palace is hereinafter referred to as the earlier palace.}}  – was identified beneath the MB IIB palace.{{efn|1= Hereinafter referred to as the later palace.}}  The remains of the earlier MB IIA palace appear to show that it was expanded to create the later MB IIB palace. The discovery of the earlier palace pushes the dates for palatial occupation of the site to the MB IIA, 150 years earlier than originally believed. The earlier MB IIA palace may have been "the most impressive structure in the Upper Galilee" at the time, and was possibly the oldest palace in Canaan.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}}

Earlier still, at the transition between the MB I and MB II, a large-scale restructuring programme was undertaken in a possible effort to transform Kabri into an idealised Syrian-style city – a powerful city-state centred around a magnificent and well-fortified palace.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|p=70}} The area was fortified, and an additional {{convert|25|ha|m2}} were enclosed within a large glacis, a type of earthwork fortification that was {{convert|50|m|ft}} wide with a stone core and that encircled the tel as it appears today. The glacis was topped by mudbrick and stone.{{sfnp|Issar|Zohar|2004|p=147}} There was an MB I palace and this was expanded into the MB II palaces.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}} This restructuring programme resulted in some parts of the tel being flattened out and a large portion of the population having to find new homes in the city, as a result of part of the MB IIA palace – along with certain parts of the rampart – being built in an area previously occupied by private houses.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|p=72}} Kabri's ancillary sites (such as [[Achziv]] and [[Avdon]]) were also built up, and migration from the hinterland to Kabri – and its secondary sites – increased dramatically as a result of these projects.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|pp=72–73}} Kabri became the capital of a major polity, with the newly expanded MB II palace at its centre.{{sfnp|Marom|al.|2014|p=63}}

At the peak of its power, Kabri may have controlled a domain that stretched from [[Mount Carmel]] in the south to the [[Sulam range]] in the north, with as many as 31 vassal sites and 30,000 subjects.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2007|p=162}} Kempinski hypothesised that Kabri might be the Bronze Age settlement of Rehov, a polity mentioned in the Execration Texts and the biblical [[Book of Joshua]].{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}}During this period, Kabri maintained significant contacts with neighbouring regions in the form of trade and exchange of ideas.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|Pierce|2008|p=62}}

Counting the MB I, MB IIA, and MB IIB stages, the palace was continuously occupied for three centuries. This is longer than any other palace in ancient Israel.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}}

===Post-Palatial===
{{details|topic=the modern history of the village of al-Kabri and the kibbutz of Kabri|Kabri, Israel#Modern history}}
[[File:AcreNE1799.jpg|thumb|[[Sidon Eyalet|Ottoman period]] French survey map from 1799 showing the Upper Galilee. Kabri's springs are shown as being exploited by Akko.]]
By 1500 BC, the site was abandoned for reasons unknown as of the 2015.{{sfnp|Burrows|2013}} Some time after the abandonment, during the Late Bronze (LB) Age (1550–1200 BC), a small village occupied the tel.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}}
In the Iron Age, the site was reoccupied by Greek mercenaries under hire from the Phoenician city-state of [[Tyre, Lebanon#Early history|Tyre]]. The mercenaries were based in a citadel there.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=2}} Close to the citadel, in the Iron Age and Phoenician periods, the later Phoenician city of Rehov was sited at Kabri. The Phoenician town was fortified by a [[casemate]] wall. This town was destroyed by the armies of the [[Neo-Babylonian]] king, [[Nebuchadnezzar II]] around 585 BC, and his rule was extended over [[Phoenicia under Babylonian rule|Phoenicia]].{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1994|p=35*}} After this destruction, the town was rebuilt and this new town grew during the [[Achaemenid Phoenicia|Persian period]] (538–332 BC). Remains from this time have been found near the tel's spring of Ein Shefa.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}} Habitation at the tel itself ends at this point. Early in the [[Phoenicia under Hellenistic rule|Hellenistic period]] (332–64 BC), the ruins of the Iron Age citadel were used for burials, but the tel was not resettled until the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period (1517-1917 AD).{{sfnp|Lehmann|2002|p=87}}

Some time during the [[Phoenicia under Roman rule|Early Roman period]], a Jewish settlement is mentioned, named Kabrita,{{sfnp|Aviram|1997|p=23}} located east of the tel in the area that was occupied by the later Arab village, eventually named al-Kabri.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} Kabri, appearing under the name of al-Kabrah, is mentioned in the last [[hudna]], or peace treaty, between the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]{{efn|1= Which by that point had been reduced to a remnant based out of Akko (called Acre).}}  and the [[Mamluks]].{{efn|1= A [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] sultanate based in Egypt which ruled most of the Levant at the time}}  In the treaty, the village and its surrounding fields, are shown as belonging to the ruler of Akko.{{sfnp|Barag|1979|p=203}}

In addition to al-Kabri which is located east of the site, during the Ottoman Period, two additional Arab villages were founded on the actual site – [[Al-Nahr|en-Nahr]] and [[al-Tall, Acre|et-Tell]] – in the southern and western portions of the tel, respectively.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} All three villages were close to the major springs, but during most of their existence, they were sparsely populated – in the low hundreds. Al-Kabri appears as ''Kabli'' and En-Nahr appears as ''el-Qahweh'' in the first topographic map of the region made in 1799 by [[Napoleon]]'s cartographer, [[Pierre Jacotin]]. This same map does not show Et-Tell, and only shows a mill in that location.{{sfnp|Karmon|1960|p=160}} Et-Tell does appear in the later [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] map of 1880,{{sfnp|Karmon|1960|p=160}} and is talked about by [[Victor Guérin]] in his travelogue of the area, published that same year, which described all three villages.{{sfnp|Guérin|1880|pp=31-33, 46, 50}} Karmon hypothesised that the new village of et-Tell might have been founded by villagers from el-Qahweh as a home for mill workers.{{sfnp|Karmon|1960|p=246}} The three villages existed up to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War when they were depopulated.{{sfnp|Morris|2004|pp=253-254}}

Much of Kabri's recorded history also deals with its springs and, starting in the Hellenistic period, the springs' relationship to the city of [[Akko]].{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|pp=15-17}} The springs of Kabri have fed Akko for centuries, and aqueducts have been built from Kabri to Akko by local rulers.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=17}} In the Hellenistic period, an aqueduct was constructed at Kabri,{{sfnp|Frankel|2002|pp=82-87}} and another was built during the governorship of [[Jezzar Pasha]], the Ottoman ruler of [[Acre, Israel#Ottoman era|Akko]] who also ruled the [[Eyalet of Sidon]] (1775-1804).{{efn|1= An ''[[eyalet]]'' was an Ottoman administrative division corresponding to a province. Most of the Galilee, including Kabri, fell under the Eyalet of Sidon.}}  Later, a new aqueduct was built by Jezzar's successor, [[Suleiman Pasha(Acre)|Sulaymán Páshá]]{{efn|1= Jezzar's aqueduct had been destroyed by the military forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].}}  in the Ottoman Period, and this aqueduct functioned up until the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.{{sfnp|Tsuk|2002|p=18}} Portions of the structure still stand today.{{sfnp|Kahanov|2011|p=104}}

Following the War, the tel was incorporated into the grounds of Kibbutz Kabri and was made into agricultural land. Soon after, the ancient remains of the site were rediscovered and on-and-off archaeological work began which continues to the present day alongside the agricultural work of the kibbutz.

==Archaeology==
[[File:TelKabriRegion.png|thumb|250px|Tel Kabri in relation to old and new settlements]]
Tel Kabri has been a subject of archaeological study since 1957, following the discovery of Late Neolithic vessels at the site in 1956 by members of the kibbutz.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1959|pp=268–269}} After 1961, most of the focus on the site shifted to Bronze Age material remains. [[Archaeological survey|Surveys]] and excavations have taken place at the site to explore its past.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|pp=2–3}}

Tel Kabri is a multi-period site, meaning that it has layers, or "strata", of occupation dating from different time periods. The tel itself operates as an agricultural area of Kibbutz Kabri, and certain layers have been subject to damage as a result of agriculture activity.{{Sfnm|Kempinski|2002a|1p=4|Kempinski|2002c|2p=35}}

The tel is located on the grounds of the kibbutz, and contains the remains of the Canaanite city from the MB period and the partially excavated later Iron Age citadel. Tel Kabri is the only Canaanite city that can be excavated in its entirety because no other city with monumental architecture was built on the site after the MB city.{{sfnp|Science Daily|2009}} In 2013, it was estimated that the palace would have occupied {{convert|6100|m2|acres|abbr=on}},{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=10}} and in 2006, it was estimated that the ancient city as a whole would have occupied {{convert|4|ha|acres|abbr=on|0}}.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=37}}

As a result of farming and erosion, Stratum 1 of the tel, the uppermost layer, has been heavily damaged.{{efn|1= Strata (sing. stratum) are layers of stratigraphy. Typically strata arranged in descending order, so Stratum 1 is physically on top of Stratum 2, which is in turn over Stratum 3, and so on. See the following section for a brief explanation of stratigraphy.}}  Prior to agricultural activities by the ''[[kibbutz]]niks'' in 1976, there still existed large towers on the tel, which may have been gates.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002c|p=35}} The entire site is cut across by a [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] period (1920–1948 AD) road that originally led from the coastal city of [[Nahariyya]] to the ''[[moshav]]'' of [[Me'ona]].{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=1}}  Most of the tel was also covered over with a metre of sterile top-soil (containing no archaeological remains) laid down for the purpose of farming by the kibbutz between Kempinski's excavations ending in 1993 and the beginning of the ongoing expedition in 2005. According to Tel Kabri Archaeological Project co-Director Assaf Yasur-Landau: "The city's preservation enables us to get a complete picture of political and social life in the Canaanite period. We can reveal whether or not it had a central government, whether taxes were levied, what sort of agriculture there was and how politics were conducted at the time."{{sfnp|Science Daily|2009}}

===Stratigraphy===
{{details|topic=stratigraphy and its uses in archaeology|Stratigraphy (archaeology)}}
Kempinski identified twelve stratigraphic layers at Tel Kabri. Stratigraphy is the layering of soil with the more recent soil layers higher up and the older soil layers further down. Archaeologists and geologists use stratigraphy to date artefacts found in the soil relative to each other.{{efn|1= See [[Relationship (archaeology)]] for further information on how the relationships between archaeological finds are determined.}}  The artefacts – in particular, [[sherd]]s of pottery – can, in turn, be used to date the layer of soil and its contents to a specific date range.{{efn|1= See ''[[Seriation (archaeology)]]'' for an explanation on how archaeologists can use pottery to create a timeline for the past.}}  The 1986-1993 Tel Kabri Expedition did not find a continuous stratigraphic sequence in any one excavation trench, and so Kempinski based the identification of the layers at Tel Kabri on finds in different areas.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} He arranged the layers as follows:{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|pp=4–5}}

===Areas===

Tel Kabri is divided up into areas (some of which are shown in the table above) for practical purposes of organisation.{{efn|1= As defined in Kempinski (2002a); p. 4-5}}  The first areas – A, B, and C – were designated during the 1975–1976 excavations by Kempinski and Prausnitz.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|pp=165–166}} Later Areas D, E, F, and T were opened by the 1986–1993 Tel Kabri Expedition, and Area D was subdivided by the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project starting in 2005.The following areas have been investigated as of the 2013 season.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;

*'''Area A''' – This area was designated Area A by Kempinski and Prausnitz during their 1975–1976 excavations.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|pp=165–166}} The area that would come to be called Area A was the first area of archaeological fieldwork at Tel Kabri. This was the survey of Area A in 1957 after Neolithic [[Stone tool|stone]] vessels had been found in 1956.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1959|pp=268–269}} This area was first excavated by Prausnitz from 1957 to 1958, when he found early Chalcolithic [[cist|cist tombs]]&lt;ref&gt;[[#cite note-FOOTNOTEPrausnitz1959268-68|Prausnitz (1959)]], pp. 268–269&lt;/ref&gt;  and houses.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1970|p=160}} Exploration in Area A has focused on the Neolithic and Chalcolithic aspects of the site.{{sfnp|Marder|al.|2002|p=299}} This area was not excavated during Kempinski's 1986–1993 Tel Kabri Expedition,{{sfnp|Marder|al.|2002|pp=299–305}} and has not been excavated by the current Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, as of the 2013 season.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;
*'''Area B''' – First excavated by Ben-Yosef in 1969,{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}} the area was later excavated by Kempinski and Prausnitz in 1975 and 1976 who gave it the name, Area B. Kempinski's 1986-1993 expedition found some pottery from the MB II, but modern human activity had destroyed the layers of previous habitation.
*'''Area C''' – Like Areas A and B, Area C was named during Kempinski and Prausnitz's 1975–1976 excavations. Area C was a 40-metre-long trench cut into the rampart on the northern end of the tel in the first year of their expedition. During Kempinski's 1986–1993 excavations, the trench was expanded south so as to study the fortifications inside the city itself.
*'''Area D''' – First uncovered as a result of [[Mekorot]]'s 1961 trench, which exposed the MB [[lime plaster|plaster]] floors. Area D is where the excavation on the MB palaces has taken place. Kempinski focused most of his efforts on Area D,{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} and excavations during the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project have been confined to Area D.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt; During the course of the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, Area D has been sub-divided as follows:&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;
**''Area D-West'' (2005, 2008–present) – First opened in 2005 to investigate a possible throne room for the final palace,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=4}} D-West has been open every year during the portion of the expedition devoted to excavation, which started in 2008, for the purpose of further uncovering palatial structures.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt; In 2013, a storage room was found in D-West which was later identified as a wine cellar. 
**''Area D-South'' (2005, 2009-2013) – In 2005, D-South was opened to investigate the southern portion of Area D which Kempinski and Niemeier hypothesised might be a religious area. Excavators found evidence of metal-working as well as what excavators referred to as a massive stone structure.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=3}} When D-South was reopened in 2009, it was further subdivided into D-South 1 and 2 and remained as two areas in 2009 and 2011, and then just D-South 1 in the 2013 season. During the course of these excavations, a structure called the "Upper Terrace or Courtyard Building" or Building 3079 was exposed in both areas, which the excavators hypothesised might be part of an as of yet unexcavated monumental structure.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|pp=4-6}}
***''D-South 1'' (2009-2013) – D-South 1 was opened in 2009 to investigate the massive stone structure found in 2005, which was found to be a wall corner and was further exposed towards the east in later seasons as building 3079. In 2013, the excavators looked for further structures as well as the possible early stages of the city rampart. They found a wall which they believe may be part of the retaining wall for another building.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|pp=6-7}}
***''D-South 2'' (2009 and 2011) – D-South 2 was opened in 2009 so as to link areas excavated in 2005 in D-South with Area F as well as to investigate, further towards the west, the massive stone structure found in 2005 (later Building 3079).{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=5}} By 2011, the large structure had been identified, including a so-called "zig-zag wall" (based on its shape), and the excavators hypothesised that there might be a lower courtyard, as well as a thus far unexcavated monumental structure.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|pp=4-6}}
**''Area D-North'' (2005, 2013 as part of Area D-West East) – Opened in 2005 to locate a possible northern wall of the final palace which had been located by geophysical surveys. The results of the 2005 season in D-North supported an earlier hypothesis by Kempinski and Niemeier that there had been a large structure on the site of the later palace preceding its construction.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|pp=3–4}} In 2013, D-North was linked via D-West East to Kempinski's old Area D excavations.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=10}}
**''Area D-West East'' (2013) – D-West East was opened in 2013 in an attempt to link up D-North with the portions of Area D excavated by Kempinski, as well as explore further rooms surrounding one of the final palace's courtyards, as well as to find a complete [[Assemblage (archaeology)|pottery assemblage]] free of possible contamination from other periods or locations in the palace.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=7}}
*'''Area E''' – Area E was excavated in 1986 via a trench in the southwest of the tel after a survey found traces of Iron Age settlement.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} It was reopened from 1989 to 1990 and from 1992 to 1993.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xvi}} This area was investigated once more by Smithline in 2004 when he recovered significant amounts of Iron Age pottery, which add to the body of knowledge for the site's post-palatial ceramics.{{sfnp|Smithline|2007}} 
*'''Area F''' – Area F was a portion of Area D created in 1990 as a result of Area D being physically cut in two by the Mandate period road. In both Kempinski's preliminary reports and on-site, Area F was treated as separate from Area D.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} However, both Kempinski's final report (2002) treated Area F as part of Area D. In 2009, Area F was reopened and excavated by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt;
*'''Area T''' – Located in the northeast of the tel, this area was excavated in 1990{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xvi}} to investigate what Kempinski's team thought might be a tower.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} They found a section of well-preserved city wall instead.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002c|p=35}}

==Archaeological expeditions==
[[File:Tel Kabri Wine Cellar with labelled wine jars.png|thumb|A view to the southeast of the 40 or so wine storage vessels ''in-situ'' in the D-West wine cellar in 2013. The expedition has numbered the vessels in the photo.{{sfnp|Koh|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2014}}]]
Archaeological work has taken place at Tel Kabri since 1956. The work at Tel Kabri has consisted of a survey, five minor excavations, and two major excavations,{{efn|1= Kempinski's 1986–1993 excavations, under the Tel Kabri Expedition, and the excavations by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project ongoing since 2005}}  although prior to 1986, much of the activity was [[Rescue archaeology|salvage excavations]] and surveys. {{as of|2015}}, Tel Kabri is being excavated by an international consortium, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project.&lt;ref name=TKAPreports /&gt; Among the finds that have been discovered at Tel Kabri, are Minoan-style wall frescoes – of which there are four known at Kabri – and the oldest and largest known palatial wine cellar in the Ancient Near East.{{sfnp|Wiener|2013b}}

In the years before the first large-scale excavations by Aharon Kempinski (1986-1993), surveys and smaller excavations were conducted to rescue artefacts and get an idea of the nature of Tel Kabri. This began when the archaeological remains of the tel were first discovered in the 1950s after kibbutzniks started coming across Neolithic artefacts near the local spring of Ein Giah. In 1956, on behalf of IDAM, the forerunner of today's Israel Antiquities Authority, David Alon and [[Daniel Rosolio]] conducted a survey in the area where the Neolithic artefacts had first been found earlier in the same year. They came across fortifications from the MB, and this survey led to salvage excavations in the following two years of what would later become Area A. In 1961, public works by the national water company revealed Bronze Age architectural remains in the form of a palace floor. In 1969, another rescue excavation was launched to investigate MB IIA tombs revealed as a result of agricultural activity by the kibbutz. {{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} From 1975 to 1976, a salvage excavation was conducted to examine areas exposed in 1957, 1958, 1961, and 1969 {{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|pp=165–166}}

From 1957 to 1958, The first rescue excavations  were carried out by [[Moshe Prausnitz]] working with the IDAM,{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=2}} who was joined by Robert Stigler of [[Brandeis University]].{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1959|p=268}} Prausnitz focused on Area A of the site where the surveyors, Alon and Rosoliyo, had first investigated the Neolithic implements found by the kibbutzniks in 1956. His expedition found Neolithic 'cist' tombs as well as round and rectangular dwellings from the lower part of the city.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|1970|p=160}}

In 1961, after Prausnitz's excavation, a large trench was cut into the tel by the national water company, Mekorot, so as to incorporate the local springs into the national water system. This inadvertently led to the start of exploration into the EB and MB archaeological remains at Kabri.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} The stratigraphy from the Mekorot trench was photographed and revealed the existence of the Bronze Age settlements.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002b|p=449,451}} It also revealed the plaster floors – the first evidence of what would later be identified as the MB II palaces.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=4}} The trench also cut into – and revealed the existence of – the MB II rampart.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}}

In 1969, as a result of the kibbutz removing an orchard from the tel, MB II tombs containing grave goods were found in what had been the lower city. Their findspot{{efn|1= Later designated as Area B in the 1975–1976 excavations.}}  was excavated by Y. Ben-Yosef for the IDAM that same year.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}}

From 1975 to 1976, salvage excavations were carried out by Prausnitz representing the IDAM, Kempinski of [[Tel Aviv University]] (TAU), and [[Ruth Amiran]] of the [[Israel Museum]], to explore the area where the MB II tombs had been found, the lower city, the earthen rampart, and the Neolithic layers of the site.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} Among their finds was a {{convert|2.10|m|ft}} tall [[stela]] that had a polished face, but no inscription.{{sfnp|Prausnitz|Kempinski|1977|p=166}} Following this excavation, Kempinski, focused his work on Tel Kabri{{sfnp|Oren|2002b|p=xii}} and applied for permits from the IDAM and permission from Kibbutz Kabri to conduct large-scale excavation of the site.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002a|p=3}}

In 1986, large-scale excavations began at Tel Kabri, initially under the direction of Kempinski for TAU, and then, from 1989 onwards, Kempinski and [[Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier]] for [[Heidelberg University]],{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=839}} until Kempinski died in July 1994, and the expedition was discontinued.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=34}} Between 1986 and 1988, the first remains of the MB palaces were discovered near the spring of Ein Shefa, along with a contemporaneous residential area. The portion of the palace initially excavated included a {{convert|10|by|10|m|ft}} hall, with a Minoan-style decorated plaster floor.{{sfnp|Stern|Lewinson-Gilboa|Aviram|1993|p=841}} The style of the floor is closest to what is referred to as the 'Cretan-Theran Late Minoan IA' tradition of wall painting.{{sfnp|Kempinski|1992|pp=112–113}} They also found more than 2,000 Aegean-style painted plaster fragments.{{sfnp|Wiener|2013a}} It was during the course of Kempinski's excavations that an Iron Age [[Phoenicia]]n citadel was also discovered. The site's excavators believed this fortification was occupied by Greek mercenaries, based on the pottery found there.{{sfnp|Niemeier|2002|pp=328–331}}

[[File:MBII duckbill axe from Kabri.png|thumb|An MB II duck-billed axe recovered during the 1988 excavations.]]

In the first year of excavation by the Kempinski expedition, work was carried out in Area C, {{efn|1= which had been designated during the 1975–1976 excavations.}}  and continued each year through the 1991 season. In 1986, Areas D and E were opened, and excavated,{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xv}} for the first time.{{sfnm|Oren|2002a|1p=55|Lehmann|2002|2p=73}} Area D was, and is, home to the MB palace, which became the focus of Kempinski's excavations for the duration of his expedition, which was the first to excavate the palace intentionally (after the accidental excavation by the Mekorot water company [[#Early work|in 1961]]).{{sfnp|Oren|2002a|p=55}} Area D was excavated each year by Kempinski's team. In 1987, the Kempinski expedition discovered the entranceway to what would be designated as Hall 611 in the palace, the ceremonial hall with the painted plaster floor.{{sfnp|Niemeier|Niemeier|2002|p=254}} Area E was excavated every year except 1987, 1988, and 1991, and in the first year, 1986, yielded Iron Age Greek pottery.{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1991|p=31*}} In 1987, new work was carried out in Prausnitz's Area B and continued each year through 1992.{{sfnp|Kempinski|2002d|p=xv}} During the 1988 excavation, a large family tomb was discovered in Area C,{{sfnp|Kempinski|1989|p=Introduction}} and MB II bronze artefacts, such as a "duck-billed axe" from Area B{{sfnp|Kempinski|1989|p=vi}} (see picture to the right), were also recovered from tombs in both Areas B and C.{{sfnp|Shalev|2002|pp=310–311}}

At the start of the 1989 season, German Archaeologist, Wolf-Dietrich Niemeier, joined Kempinski's Tel Kabri Expedition as his co-director. Along with the excavations in Areas B, C, D, and E, additional work was carried out in the new Area F,{{efn|1= An extension of Area D, again for the sake of organisation}}  which continued each year excluding the 1991 season, and in Area T,{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1990|p=1*}} which was excavated in 1990. Area T was an area at the northern part of the tel opened to explore what looked like a surviving tower but the exploration of which resulted in finding well-preserved fortifications. In 1990, finds included a Phoenician seal impression which had both the name of the official who owned it and the year according to the [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyrian]] calendar.{{sfnp|Naveh|Kempinski|1991|p=10*}} Also in 1990, the western portion of Hall 611 was completely revealed in Area D, and preliminary preservation efforts were completed on the hall's painted plaster floor.{{sfnp|Kempinski|Niemeier|1991|p=1*}} Work by the Kempinski expedition continued up though 1993. In Area E, work was done to investigate occupation of the site after the Iron Age – prior focus having been on the Bronze Age aspects of the site.

At the end of the 1993 season, the painted plaster floor in Hall 611 was covered over with [[geotextile]], as the team expected to return the following summer in 1994. However, Kempinski's excavations never resumed past 1993, as Kempinski died in June the following year.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=34}} In accordance with his wishes, Kempinski was buried at Tel Kabri.{{sfnp|Oren|2002b|p=xv}}

Between the major excavations by Kempinski and the ongoing Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, two separate minor excavations were conducted by Dina Shalem and Howard Smithline. In 1999, Shalem headed up a salvage excavation ahead of a construction project on the Mandate period road running through the tel. Her team worked in Area D and came across EB architecture, as well as some Chalcolithic sherds and a possible surface from that period.{{sfnp|Shalem|2009|pp=19–39}} In 2004, the Israeli telecommunications company, Cellcom, was laying down new telephone cable near Area E, and Smithline was asked to conduct a salvage excavation before the work started. He used this as an opportunity to investigate further the Iron Age aspects of the site. His team did not make any new discoveries, but did add to the collection of Iron Age I (1,200–1,000 BC) and Iron Age II (1,000–586 BC) pottery from the site.{{sfnp|Smithline|2007}}

In 2003, former Tel Kabri Expedition excavator, Assaf Yasur-Landau,{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|p=34}} and geophysicist, Yitzhach Makovsky, both then of Tel Aviv University, conducted an investigation to see if Kempinski and Niemeier had underestimated the size of the palace at Tel Kabri. They conducted [[Electrical resistivity tomography|electric resistivity]] and [[Magnetic survey (archaeology)|magnetometric]] soundings in an attempt to map out the architectural features under the soil without having to dig trenches. Their findings showed that the palace was indeed larger than previously thought.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|pp=67-68}} With these results, Yasur-Landau approached his former [[Tel Megiddo#Archaeology|Megiddo Expedition]] colleague, Prof. [[Eric H. Cline]] of [[The George Washington University]], the following year and asked whether he would like to co-direct new excavations at Tel Kabri. After devoting a year to getting the necessary funding and permits for excavation, the two were able to begin work on the site in the summer of 2005.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006b|pp=34-36}}

Since 2005, the renewed excavations have been conducted by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, an international team co-directed by Yasur-Landau, now of the Leon Recanati Institute for Maritime Studies at the [[University of Haifa]], Cline on behalf of The George Washington University, and Prof. Andrew Koh of [[Brandeis University]], which officially joined the consortium in 2013.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=1}} The majority of these excavation seasons have taken place at the MB palaces in Area D of the tel,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Ebeling|Mazow|2011|pp=70–75}} and, since 2009, have been semi-annual.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=1}}

The first four seasons at Tel Kabri were dedicated to investigating the site's potential for future large-scale excavation. As a result, the 2005 season was exploratory in nature, featuring assessment of the site and minor excavations to determine the viability of conducting future work at the site.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=1}}During the course of the season, additional palatial architecture was uncovered, and the palace was found to be twice as large as previously thought by Kempinski, thus confirming the results of the 2003 soundings by Yasur-Landau and Makovsky.{{sfnp|Cline|2009|p=68}}  Along with this, another structure – possibly communal or another palace – was discovered below the MB II palace.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=1}} It was during the 2005 season that the first find of a gold artefact at Kabri was made.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=3}}

The team also found that in the time between the end of Kempinski's excavations and the start of the new expedition, there had been significant damage done to the site by the elements. The most apparent example of this was the [[geotextile]] that had been placed by Kempinski to cover the painted plaster floor in the palace hall.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|p=5}} Since 1993, the geotextile had bonded to the plaster, and this made it impossible to remove the geotextile without destroying the floor. As a result of this, much of the work done in the 2005 season was also conservation work.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2005|pp=5–6}}

The following 2006 season was a series of surveys of the region around Kabri. The goals of this season were only partially fulfilled during the original timeframe though, as the 2006 season coincided with the [[2006 Lebanon War]].{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=1}} The team was able to survey MB II sites in the area around the site and see how they would have interacted with Kabri in that time period. However, as a result of the war, they had to postpone any aerial photography of the tel – by order of the [[Israeli Air Force]] – and access to the pottery from previous excavations – held in the IAA storerooms at Kibbutz [[Beit HaEmek]] – was restricted for the duration of the war.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=1}} In that time period, the IAA did allow the team to remove the relevant pottery from Beit HaEmek{{efn|1= This was a result of Beit HaEmek being under continuous bombardment.}}  to Tel Aviv for study, where the pottery could also be kept safe.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=4}} The team had to wait until mid-September to achieve its goals fully. As a result of the dangers posed by the rockets from the north,{{efn|1= Six rockets struck the tel and one rocket hit the kibbutz itself.}}  some members of the team had to return to their home countries, without completing their work.{{sfnp|Cline|Yasur-Landau|2006a|p=1}}

The 2007 season was partly devoted to finishing the work that had to be halted in the 2006 season, as well as preparing the site for excavation the following season.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2007|p=1}} Through comparative studies of pottery, the team was able to map out Kabri's rise to regional power in the MB II.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2007|p=3}} The architecture of the palace was mapped out using a [[total station]], and a digital topographic map was made of the tel using aerial photography and measurements on the ground.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2007|p=5}}

The 2008 season saw a return to excavation at the site, with a focus on the palace in Area D that had been discovered by Kempinski. The team wanted to go deeper and explore the possibility of there being a palace beneath the one Kempinski found.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2008|p=2}} They managed to get a clearer picture of the entire MB palatial area up to the 1600s BC destruction, and recovered further wall plaster fragments. The structure underneath the MB II palace was determined most likely to be a palace itself, and further fragments of Aegean wall frescos and imported pottery were found, allowing the excavators to push back the time for contact with the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean]] and [[Alashiya|Cyprus]] to the MB I period.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2008|p=8}} At the close of the dig season, the site was covered up to preserve it in the off-season.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2008|p=9}}

2009 was the first year of large-scale excavation by the expedition, and the first year that the system of semi-annual excavation – with the off-years devoted to data-processing – was implemented and was in use as of the 2013 season.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=1}} The 2009 season was also the only year that two separate seasons of excavations were conducted: a summer large-scale excavation, and a winter minor excavation. During the summer season of 2009, additional Aegean style frescoes were found at the site. In Area D-West, the northern bounds of the palace were successfully determined,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|p=2}} and a corridor was discovered that held restorable pottery.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2009|pp=4–5}} During the winter season, the corridor in D-West was revisited, so that its use could be determined.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|pp=1–2}} As a result of these excavations, the date for the construction of the earliest palace was revised and estimated to be in the MB I period in the 1800s BC, making the palace at Kabri one of the oldest palaces in Canaan.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2010|p=8}}

[[File:Tell Kabri (4).JPG|thumb|2011 excavations in Area D South-1]]
The main finds of the 2011 season included an [[orthostat]] building close to the palace, further pieces of painted plaster,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|p=1}} and a scarab of the [[Second Intermediate Period]].{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|Cline|2011|p=4}}

Andrew Koh, and students from Brandeis University, were responsible for doing the residue analysis on the wine jars in the storage room, which led to the room's identification as a wine cellar.}}]]
During the 2013 season, the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project discovered the first known complete MB storage room in Canaan.{{sfnp|Wiener|2013b}} On 22 November 2013, the team announced that this storage room had been found to be the oldest palatial [[wine cellar]] in the Ancient Near East, with 40 large ceramic jars, totalling 2,000 litres in capacity,{{efn|1= The equivalent of 3,000 750ml [[Wine bottle size|standard wine bottles]].}}  containing traces of wine dating to 1700 BC.{{sfnp|Wilford|2013}} During the latter half of the season, the dig shifted its focus to Area D-West, where the wine cellar was located. To speed up the process of uncovering the vessels in the wine cellar, for part of the time, the team adopted the atypical practice of working in morning and afternoon shifts of 05:00 to 12:00 and 13:00 to 19:00, respectively,{{sfnp|Ingeno|2015|p=51}} almost exclusively in Area D-West.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=6}}{{efn|1= Near Eastern summer archaeological digs typically dig in the morning only so as to avoid the afternoon heat. Exceptions are made when time is a constraint or the collecting of artefacts is urgent.{{sfnp|Ingeno|2015|p=51}}}} Prior to the actual removal of the vessels, [[LiDAR]] work was done on the site, for the first time, in this area.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=2,6}} Near the end of the season, red plaster fragments were discovered while the area was being cleaned.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=6}} However, the finds were not restricted to Area D-West. In Area D-South, a deposit was discovered that held additional pieces of wall plaster.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=6}} In Area D-West-East, the area of D-North was linked up with the areas excavated by Kempinski, thus unifying the whole area from D-North to D-West, exposing further architecture,{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=7,10}} and bringing the estimate of the size of the palace to approximately {{convert|6000|m2|abbr=on}}.{{sfnp|Yasur-Landau|al.|2013|p=10}} As a result of the discovery of two doorways in D-West at the end of the 2013 season, part of the 2015 season will be devoted to exploring where – and to what – these doorways lead.{{sfnp|Lopatto|2013}}

==Site reports==
Below are the site reports that could be located for the archaeological work at Tel Kabri. They have been arranged chronologically, with internet links where available, for reference.

The reports for the 1957–1958, 1975–1976, 1999, and 2004 excavations were all published in journals, some in English and some in Hebrew. It was not until the Tel Kabri Expedition of Tel Aviv University under Kempinski that stand-alone excavation reports for Tel Kabri were published, and then Kempinski made sure to publish a report for each year – a practice that has continued with the ongoing excavations by the Tel Kabri Archaeological Project of The George Washington University and the University of Haifa. Reports for the 1969 survey could not be located.

'''''The Compleat Housewife, or, Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion''''' is a [[cookery book]] written by [[Eliza Smith]] and first published in [[London]] in 1727. It became extremely popular, running through 18 editions in fifty years.

It was the first cookery book to be published in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] of America: it was printed in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]], in 1742. It contained the first published recipe for "[[ketchup|katchup]]", and appears to be the earliest source for [[bread and butter pudding]].

The book includes recipes not only for foods but for wines, cordial-waters, medicines and salves.

==Book==

The title page describes ''The Compleat Housewife'' as a

{{quote|collection of several hundred of the most approved receipts, in cookery, pastry, confectionery, preserving, pickles, cakes, creams, jellies, made wines, cordials. And also bills of fare for every month of the year. To which is added, a collection of nearly two hundred family receipts of medicines; viz. drinks, syrups, salves, ointments, and many other things of sovereign and approved efficacy in most distempers, pains, aches, wounds, sores, etc. never before made publick in these parts; fit either for private families, or such publick-spirited gentlewomen as would be beneficent to their poor neighbours.}}

The book was the first to publish a recipe for "[[ketchup|Katchup]]"; it included mushrooms, anchovies and horseradish.&lt;ref name=JASNA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 91.&lt;/ref&gt; The title ''The Compleat Housewife'' may owe something to [[Gervase Markham]]'s 1615 ''[[The English Huswife]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Appelbaum |first1=Robert |title=Rhetoric and Epistemology in Early Printed Recipe Collections |journal=Journal for Early Modern Cultural Studies |date=2003 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=1–35 |jstor=27793766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little is known of Smith beyond what she writes of herself in the preface. She spent her life working as a cook or housekeeper in wealthy households, and unlike [[Elizabeth Raffald]] who left service to run her own shop, continued in that profession despite the success of her book. It is possible that she worked at [[Beaulieu Abbey]], Hampshire. She is critical of cookery books written by men who conceal their secrets, preventing readers from using their recipes successfully.&lt;ref name=JASNA/&gt;&lt;ref name=CT&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Robbins |first1=Jean |title=Understanding Women's Lives through their Cookbooks |url=http://spec.lib.vt.edu/culinary/CulinaryThymes/2005_07/cookbooks.html |publisher=Culinary Thymes |volume=7 |issue=Winter 2005 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Badley |first1=Jocelyn |title=Compleat Housewife, The; Or, Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion |url=http://www.crcstudio.org/conf_exhibit/Pages/viewtext.php?tid=17&amp;route=browseby.php&amp;start=64&amp;by=year |website=Women Writing and Reading |publisher=CRC Studio |accessdate=26 March 2015 |date=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The preface contains the following passage:

{{quote|It being grown as fashionable for a book now to appear in public without a preface, as for a lady to appear at a ball without a hoop-petticoat, I shall conform to the custom for fashion-sake and not through any necessity. The subject being both common and universal, needs no argument to introduce it, and being so necessary for the gratification of the appetite, stands in need of no encomiums to allure persons to the practice of it; since there are but a few nowadays who love not good eating and drinking}}

The passage was lightly adapted from an earlier book with a similar title, John Nott's ''[[The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary|The Cooks and Confectioners Dictionary: or, the Accomplish’d Housewife’s Companion]]'' (1723), which declared he had added an introduction because fashion had made it as odd for a book to be printed without one as for a man to be seen "in church without a neck cloth or a lady without a hoop-petticoat."&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nott |first1=John |title= The cooks and confectioners dictionary; or, The accomplish'd housewifes companion |date=1723 |publisher=C.

===Approach===
Smith offers no general advice, either at the start of the book or at the start of chapters; each chapter consists entirely of recipes. There are no lists of ingredients, these simply being mentioned as needed in the recipes. Most recipes do not mention either oven temperature or cooking time, though for example "To candy Orange Flowers" instructs "set your glasses in a stove with a moderate heat",&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 206.&lt;/ref&gt; and "To Stew a Rump of Beef" states "this requires six or seven hours stewing."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Pages 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The recipes are predominantly English, but dishes include French and other foreign names, and imported ingredients such as spices.

[[File:Compleat Housewife - A Battalia Pye.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4&lt;!--size for small print sample--&gt;|Recipe for [[Battalia pie|battalia pye]] from Eliza Smith's ''The Compleat Housewife'', 9th edition, 1739.]]
Recipes are described tersely, and do not generally spell out basic techniques such as how to make pastry; the recipe for "A [[Battalia pie|Battalia Pye]]"{{efn|The name means a pie filled with ''beatilles'', small blessed objects (Latin ''beatus'', blessed) such as, according to the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], "Cocks-combs, Goose-gibbets, Ghizzards, Livers, and other Appurtenances of Fowls (1706)". It is not connected with Italian ''battaglia'', battle.}} does not mention pastry at all, though it is called for with the instruction to "close the pye":&lt;ref name=Smith10&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|'''''A Battalia Pye'''''&lt;br&gt;Take four small chickens, four squab pigeons, four sucking [[rabbit|rabbet]]s; cut them in pieces, season them with savoury spice, and lay 'em in the pye, with four [[sweetbreads]] sliced, and as many sheep's [[tongue]]s, two shiver'd palates,{{efn|Bones were cooked to add flavour and to release [[gelatine]].}} two pair of [[testicle|lamb-stones]], twenty or thirty [[comb (anatomy)|coxcomb]]s, with savoury balls and [[oyster]]s. Lay on butter, and close the pye. A Lear.&lt;ref name=Smith10/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=An Now For Something Completely Different: The British Tradition of The Savory Pie |url=http://www.britishfoodinamerica.com/A-Number-of-Savory-Pies-for-Fall/the-lyrical/An-Now-For-Something-Completely-Different-The-British-Tradition-of-The-Savory-Pie/#.VRQA8eHtjgw |journal=The Lyrical | volume=44 | issue=Spring 2015 |accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, a few frequently-used components of dishes are described, such as "A Lear for Savoury Pyes" and "A Ragoo for made Dishes". The "Lear" is a thickened sauce made with [[claret]], gravy, "oyster liquor", anchovies, herbs, onion and butter. The "Ragoo" contains similar ingredients, with the addition of sliced meats and mushrooms; the recipe ends with "use it when called for", such as in the Battalia Pye.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eliza Smith The Compleat Housewife 1739 To Promote Breeding.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4&lt;!--size for small print sample--&gt;|Recipe "To Promote Breeding"]]
Recipes are provided for home-made medicines and remedies such as "To promote Breeding" for women wanting to become [[pregnant]]. The recipe calls for a spoonful of "stinking orrice"{{efn|Stinking iris, ''[[Iris foetidissima]]''.}} syrup to be taken night and morning, and for "good ale" to be boiled with "the piths of 3 ox-backs,{{efn|[[Spinal cord]]s.}} half a handful of clary, a handful of nep (or cat-bos)",{{efn|Common catnip, ''[[Nepeta cataria]]'' or catmint, ''[[Nepeta mussinii]]''.}} dates, raisins, and nutmegs. The woman drinking this mixture "at your going to-bed" is enjoined "as long as it lasts, accompany not with your husband."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 1739. Page 258.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Compleat Housewife'' was the first cookery book to be published in America, when [[William Parks (publisher)|William Parks]], an ambitious and enterprising printer (originally from [[Shropshire]]) printed it in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] in 1742.&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt;&lt;ref name=UPenn&gt;{{cite web |title=HOUSEHOLD WORDS: Women Write from and for the Kitchen |url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/aresty/007.html |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Library |accessdate=28 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His version of ''The Compleat Housewife'', a "cookery book of ambitious scope", was based on the fifth London edition of 1732, altered to suit American taste, and without recipes "the ingredients or materials for which are not to be had in this country."&lt;ref name=MSU&gt;{{cite web | author=Longone, Jan | url=http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/intro_essay.html | title=Feeding America | accessdate=28 March 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150816044847/http://digital.lib.msu.edu/projects/cookbooks/html/intro_essay.html | archive-date=2015-08-16 | dead-url=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copies of the 1742 edition have become very rare, but "happily, one copy has returned to the city of its origin", and is in the Library of Colonial Williamsburg, Incorporated.&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt;

==Reception==

In 1893, the bibliographer [[William Carew Hazlitt]] allocated 54 pages of his history of cookery books to the ''Compleat Housewife'', commenting that "the highly curious contents of E. Smith ... may be securely taken to exhibit the state of knowledge in England upon this subject in the last quarter of the seventeenth and the first quarter of the eighteenth [century]".&lt;ref name=Yost&gt;{{cite journal| author=Yost, Genevieve |title=The Compleat Housewife or Accomplish'd Gentlewoman's Companion.

Christine Mitchell, reviewing the Chawton House reprint in 2010 for the Jane Austen Society of North America,  wrote that Eliza Smith's book "met the growing need for a text to assist women with their task of maintaining a household." She quotes Elizabeth Wallace's introduction as saying that it gives modern readers reason to appreciate having a refrigerator and a global food system that brings us out-of-season produce. Yet, she observes, the English housewife had many varieties of vegetables, 30 kinds of seafood and 35 kinds of poultry (including hares and rabbits). She notes that the book also describes home remedies, the housewife having to function as " chef, doctor, pharmacist, exterminator, chemist, laundress, and all-around handy-woman." Reflecting that the recipes would "probably never" be used today, and the medicines are useless, the book remains invaluable for researchers, gives readers a glimpse into the world of [[Jane Austen]] and her contemporaries, and richly documents eighteenth-century English life.&lt;ref name=JASNA&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=Christine M. |title=Book Review: The Handy Homemaker, Eighteenth-Century Style |url=http://www.jasna.org/bookrev/br261p22.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010004203/http://jasna.org/bookrev/br261p22.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 October 2010 |journal=JASNA News |issue=Spring 2010 |accessdate=26 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patrick Spedding, in ''Script &amp; Print'', notes that the book was very popular in the eighteenth century, with 20 London editions in fifty years. However, he roundly criticises the 1983 Arlon House facsimile reprint of the 16th edition for deliberately omitting recipes including "To promote Breeding", suggesting this was because the publisher was concerned they might be harmful.&lt;ref name=Spedding/&gt;

The historian Sandra Sherman comments that ''The Compleat Housewife'' "is the first female-authored blockbuster."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sherman |first1=Sandra |title=Invention of the Modern Cookbook| publisher=ABC-Clio| url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/126710932/Sandra-Sherman-Invention-of-the-Modern-Cookbook-2010#scribd |accessdate=28 March 2015 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bibliographer Genevieve Yost comments that "E. Smith's popularity in eighteenth century England was challenged perhaps most seriously by [[Hannah Glasse]], who admittedly is better remembered today",&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt; adding at once that Glasse is recalled mainly for the controversy over whether she actually existed, and for the recipe that people supposed started with "First catch your hare."&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt; Yost suggests that the book's popularity in the colonies was probably increased by the publication of an American edition.&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt; She concludes that

{{quote|The quantities and ingredients render many of the recipes unsuitable to the modern kitchen, but these old cookbooks are increasing in value and interest to libraries, bibliophiles, and collectors, who find in them a truly revealing and fascinating glimpse of the past.&lt;ref name=Yost/&gt;&lt;!--these brackets close quote--&gt;}}&lt;!--quote closed--&gt;

1n the Spring 2006 issue of ''[[Prairie Schooner]]'', [[Sarah Kennedy (poet)|Sarah Kennedy]] published a poem called "The Compleat Housewife, 1727", with the gloss "the first popular cookbook published in Great Britain". The poem begins:

{{italic title}}
'''''The Execution of Emperor Maximilian''''' is a series of paintings by [[Édouard Manet]] from 1867 to 1869, depicting the [[execution by firing squad]] of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Emperor Maximilian I]] of the short-lived [[Second Mexican Empire]]. Manet produced three large oil paintings, a smaller oil sketch and a [[lithograph]] of the same subject. All five works were brought together for an exhibition in London and Mannheim in 1992–1993 and at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York in 2006.

==History==
Maximilian was born in 1832, the son of [[Archduke Franz Karl of Austria]] and [[Princess Sophie of Bavaria]].  After a career in the Austrian Navy, he was encouraged by [[Napoleon III]] to become Emperor of Mexico following the [[French intervention in Mexico]].  Maximilian arrived in Mexico in May 1864. He faced significant opposition from forces loyal to the deposed president [[Benito Juárez]] throughout his reign, and the Empire collapsed after Napoleon withdrew French troops in 1866.

Maximilian was captured in May 1867, sentenced to death at a court martial, and executed, together with Generals [[Miguel Miramón]] and [[Tomás Mejía]], on 19 June 1867.

Manet supported the Republican cause{{cn|date=June 2018}} but was inspired to start work on a painting, heavily influenced by [[Francisco Goya|Goya]]'s ''[[The Third of May 1808]]''. The final work, painted in 1868–1869 is now held by the [[Kunsthalle Mannheim]]. The painting is signed by Manet in the lower left corner but bears the date of Maximilian's execution in 1867, despite being painted in 1868–1869.

Fragments of an earlier and larger painting from about 1867–1868 are held by the [[National Gallery]] in London. Parts of that work were probably cut off by Manet, but it was largely complete on his death. Other parts were sold separately after his death. The surviving pieces were reassembled by [[Edgar Degas]] and they were bought by the National Gallery in 1918, then separated again until 1979, and finally combined on one canvas in 1992.

A third, unfinished, oil painting is held by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]], donated from Mr. and Mrs. [[Frank Gair Macomber]] in 1930, who bought it from [[Ambroise Vollard]] in 1909. A much smaller work in oils, the study for the Mannheim painting is held by the [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] in [[Copenhagen]].

Manet was refused permission to reproduce the lithograph in 1869, but an edition of 50 impressions was produced in 1884, after his death.  Examples of the lithograph are held by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the [[Clark Art Institute]] in [[Williamstown, Massachusetts]].

In the Boston version of the painting, the soldiers wear clothes and sombrero of Mexican Republicans. In the final version in Mannheim, they are dressed in 19th-century field dress, common to many armies at that time, but Manet recognized the irony that they could be easily mistaken for French soldiers in this picture.

The sergeant wearing a red cap clearly resembles Napoleon III (in reality, the execution was bungled, and a [[coup de grâce]] was required).

Political sensitivities made it impossible for Manet to exhibit his paintings in France during the reign of Napoleon III, but the Mannheim version was exhibited in New York and Boston in 1879–1880, brought there by Manet's friend, the opera singer [[Émilie Ambre]].&lt;ref&gt;Tinterow, Gary and [[Geneviève Lacambre|Lacambre, Geneviève]] (2003). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4somoplUFVwC&amp;pg=PA503&amp;lpg=PA503 ''Manet/Velázquez: The French Taste for Spanish Painting''], p. 503. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mannheim and Boston versions were exhibited together at the [[Salon d'Automne]] in 1905.  The Mannheim version was acquired by the Kunsthalle Mannheim in 1910 after it had been exhibited at the [[Berliner Secession]] earlier that year.

'''''The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time''''' is a [[wikt:posthumous|posthumous]] collection of previously published and unpublished material by [[Douglas Adams]]. It consists largely of essays about technology and life experiences, but its major selling point is the inclusion of the incomplete novel on which Adams was working at the time of his death, ''The Salmon of Doubt'' (from which the collection gets its title, a reference to the [[Irish mythology|Irish myth]] of the [[Salmon of Knowledge]]).

English editions of the book were published in the United States and UK in May 2002, exactly one year after the author's death.

==Original intention==
''The Salmon of Doubt'' was originally intended to be a [[Dirk Gently]] novel. The plot, set a few weeks after the events in ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'', involves Dirk Gently refusing to help find the missing half of a cat, receiving large amounts of money from an unknown client, and then flying to the United States. Dirk pays a visit to Kate Schechter (who had first appeared in ''The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul'') and tells her that prior to the potential client, he had been so bored that he had started a habit of dialling his own phone number and discovered he'd answered his own calls.
A faxed summary reprinted before the text mentions travelling "through the nasal membranes of a rhinoceros, to a distant future dominated by estate agents and heavily armed kangaroos."

The version in the published book was described as the strongest content from several unfinished drafts that were written.

===Later intention===
Adams said that while he originally planned on writing a third Dirk Gently book, the ideas which he had for it would have fit better into another Hitchhiker's book: "A lot of the stuff which was originally in ''The Salmon of Doubt'' really wasn't working", and he planned on "salvaging some of the ideas that I couldn't make work in a Dirk Gently framework and putting them in a Hitchhiker framework... and for old time's sake I may call it ''The Salmon of Doubt''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-salmon-of-doubt-by-douglas-adams-650803.html | location=London |work=The Independent | title=The Salmon of Doubt by Douglas Adams | date=10 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/features/cover-stories-douglas-adams-narnia-chronicles-something-like-a-house-672250.html | location=London |work=The Independent | title=Cover Stories: Douglas Adams, Narnia Chronicles, Something like a House | date=5 January 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had expressed dissatisfaction with the fifth ''Hitchhiker'' book, ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', saying "People have said, quite rightly, that ''Mostly Harmless'' is a very bleak book. And it was a bleak book. I would love to finish ''Hitchhiker'' on a slightly more upbeat note, so five seems to be a wrong kind of number; six is a better kind of number."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/sep/17/douglasadams?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=books | location=London |work=The Guardian | title=Eoin Colfer to write sixth Hitchhiker's Guide book | first=Alison | last=Flood | date=17 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Newsome |url=http://www.mattnewsome.co.uk/ |title=Matt Newsome's 1998 interview with Douglas Adams |publisher=Mattnewsome.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published version==
The book as published is divided into two main sections: "Life, the Universe and Everything", which utilizes fiction, essays and interviews with Adams, and ''The Salmon of Doubt'', which presents the most complete version of the novel as Adams left it.

The first section is then subdivided into three: "Life" touches upon Adams' own life, "The Universe" covers Adams' views of reality and "Everything", which is more wide open and includes the original version of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's]] short story "[[Young Zaphod Plays It Safe]]".

==Editions==
The UK edition includes an introduction by [[Stephen Fry]], and the US edition, instead, by [[Christopher Cerf (musician and television producer)|Christopher Cerf]]. The audiobook edition consists of 7 CDs, mostly read by [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]], but also includes both of the introductions, read by their respective authors, as well as the tributes written and read by [[Richard Dawkins]]. US paperback editions have yet another introduction, written by [[Terry Jones]], and omit some material due to issues with copyright.

The fourteenth printing of the UK/Canadian paperback, {{ISBN|978-0-330-32312-3}}, differs in content from the ninth printing of the US hardcover edition, {{ISBN|1-4000-4508-8}}, in the following ways. The paperback contains a foreword written by Stephen Fry; the hardcover contains an introduction by Christopher Cerf. Adams's letter to David Vogel on page 168 has Adams's London address at the top in the hardcover, but it is missing from the paperback. "[[The Private Life of Genghis Khan]]" has been omitted from the paperback.

The US mass market paperback edition {{ISBN|0-345-45529-0}} contains everything in the US hardcover edition, and adds "An Introduction to the Introduction to the New Edition" and an "Introduction to the New Edition", both by Terry Jones. The material that was omitted from the UK/Canadian paperback edition is intact in the US mass market paperback edition.

==Adaptation==
[[BBC Radio 4]] had commissioned a third Dirk Gently six-part radio series for broadcast in mid-2010, based on the uncompleted chapters of ''The Salmon of Doubt'', and written by ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'' writer [[Kim Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/24312/douglas-adams-final-dirk-gently-novel-to-be/ |title=Final Dirk Gently novel to be adapted for Radio 4 |publisher=Thestage.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans have been dropped in favour of creating a [[Dirk Gently (TV series)|television adaption]] of the two complete novels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2009/10/11/9767/bbc_plans_dirk_gently_tv_series|title=BBC plans Dirk Gently TV series|publisher=Chortle.co.uk|date=11 October 2009|accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Theatre Chipping Norton''', sometimes '''The Theatre, Chipping Norton''', is a theatre, cinema, gallery and music venue in [[Chipping Norton]], [[Oxfordshire]], England.&lt;ref name="house"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Theatre, Chipping Norton|url=http://housetheatre.org.uk/venues/the-theatre-chipping-norton/|website=House|publisher=Farnham Maltings|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Us now|url=http://www.chippingnortontheatre.com/index.php?us_now|publisher=The Theatre Chipping Norton|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main auditorium was originally a [[The Salvation Army|Salvation Army]] citadel, built in 1888. After some years as a furniture warehouse it was rediscovered in 1968; fundraising began in 1973, the theatre was registered as a charity in 1974, and it opened as a theatre in 1975. It acquired adjoining properties to provide space for bar, gallery, green rooms, offices and rehearsal space, and underwent a major refurbishment in 1996 with [[Arts Council England]] assistance.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=Brief history of the theatre|url=http://www.chippingnortontheatre.com/index.php?history|publisher=The Theatre Chipping Norton|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre produces original shows and hosts touring companies; in 2016 it co-produced with [[The Dukes (Lancaster)|The Dukes]] a 20th-anniversary touring production of ''[[Stones in His Pockets]]''. It prides itself on its annual "world-renowned traditional family [[pantomime]]".&lt;ref name=history /&gt;&lt;ref name="cavendish"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cavendish|first1=Dominic|title=Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves, The Theatre, Chipping Norton, review|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-reviews/8990274/Ali-Baba-and-the-Forty-Thieves-The-Theatre-Chipping-Norton-review.html|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=The Telegraph|date=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dicks|first1=Matt|title=Robin Hood review at the Theatre, Chipping Norton – ‘artfully silly’|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2015/robin-hood-review-at-the-theatre-chipping-norton-artfully-silly/|accessdate=13 March 2016|work=[[The Stage]]|date=19 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''This is the Public Domain''' is an [[art]] project designed to look at the difficulty in demarcating a piece of land as part of the international commons for [[perpetuity]] within the United States.&lt;ref name= "This is the Public Domain mute mag"&gt;[http://www.metamute.org/en/This-is-the-Public-Domain/ 'This is the Public Domain' ''Mute Magazine'' May 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cca.rca.ac.uk/publicsmog/documents/PressRelease_publicsmog.pdf Press release from the Royal College of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''This is the Public Domain'' was created by [[San Francisco]] based artist [[Amy Balkin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsandecology.org.uk/magazine/artworks/project-1 "This is the Public Domain in Arts &amp; Ecology magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Balkin purchased {{convert|2.5|acre|m2}} of land in Tehachapi, California&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artofcommonspace.org/site/75/325.html Haring Woods Associates]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cca.edu/calendar/1163 California College of the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt; with the intention of giving them to a "global everyone." As a means of doing this, Balkin looked into a number of legal strategies within the constraints of [[property law|property]] and [[copyright law]].

==Legal Tactics==
Those working to create ''This is the [[Public Domain]]'' have attempted a number of legal strategies to achieve their goal.&lt;ref name= "This is the Public Domain"&gt;[http://thisisthepublicdomain.org This is the Public Domain website]&lt;/ref&gt; The first was attempting to [[copyright]] and then enter into the public domain the land within the project's boundaries as a [[conceptual art]]work. However, the artists involved learned that one can only give away the rights of works which can be reproduced. In order to deal with this limitation, a bench was created and the land was declared an extension of said bench.

The second was to enter the land into the public domain by putting the land into a [[land trust|trust]] and then distributing the [[license]] which allows people to occupy or modify the land. Included in the license is that the land must either be licensed for universal use or for no one's use. Redistribution of this license is allowed, but modification is not.

The final three strategies appear to be theoretical. One is the creation of a bearer corporation which controls the land. The upside to this from the artists' perspective is that the land would have strong legal protection, but they question whether [[corporation|corporate]] control is the proper way to achieve it. Another is creating a Limited Common Property Regime. This is seen as acceptable if one can include the entire world as members of the regime, but they have doubts about whether or not that would be possible. The final is creating a land trust. However, this would require [[private ownership]], and thus is likely to be rejected.

[[File:Three-act structure.svg|thumb|500px|A visual representation of the three-act structure]]

The '''three-act structure''' is a model used in [[narrative]] fiction that divides a story into three parts ([[act (drama)|acts]]), often called the Setup, the Confrontation and the Resolution.

== Structure ==
'''The first act''' is usually used for [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]], to establish the main characters, their relationships and the world they live in. Later in the first act, a dynamic, on-screen incident occurs, known as the ''[[inciting incident]]'', or ''catalyst'', that confronts the main character (the [[protagonist]]), and whose attempts to deal with this incident lead to a second and more dramatic situation, known as the first plot point, which (a) signals the end of the first act, (b) ensures life will never be the same again for the protagonist and (c) raises a dramatic question that will be answered in the climax of the film. The dramatic question should be framed in terms of the protagonist's call to action, (Will X recover the diamond? Will Y get the girl? Will Z capture the killer?).&lt;ref name="trottier"&gt;Trottier, David: "The Screenwriter's Bible", pp. 5–7. Silman James, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The second act''', also referred to as "rising action", typically depicts the protagonist's attempt to resolve the problem initiated by the first turning point, only to find themselves in ever worsening situations. Part of the reason protagonists seem unable to resolve their problems is because they do not yet have the skills to deal with the forces of [[Antagonist|antagonism]] that confront them. They must not only learn new skills but arrive at a higher sense of awareness of who they are and what they are capable of, in order to deal with their predicament, which in turn changes who they are. This is referred to as ''character development'' or a ''[[character arc]]''. This cannot be achieved alone and they are usually aided and abetted by mentors and co-protagonists.&lt;ref name="trottier"/&gt;

'''The third act''' features the resolution of the story and its subplots. The [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] is the [[Scene (drama)|scene]] or sequence in which the main tensions of the story are brought to their most intense point and the dramatic question answered, leaving the protagonist and other characters with a new sense of who they really are.&lt;ref name="trottier"/&gt;

[[File:Ben hands off to Willie.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] of the [[National Football League|NFL]] wearing their 75th year "Throwback" uniforms.]]

'''Throwback uniforms''', '''throwback jerseys''' or '''retro kits''' or '''heritage guernseys''' are [[sports uniform]]s styled to resemble the uniforms that a team wore [[Retro style|in the past]]. One-time or limited-time retro uniforms are sometimes produced to be worn by teams in games, on special occasions such as anniversaries of significant events.

Throwback uniforms have proven popular in all major pro and college sports in North America, not only with fans, but with the teams' merchandising departments. Because the "authentic" uniforms (accurate reproductions) and less-authentic "replicas" had been so popular at retail, the professional leagues institutionalized throwbacks as "[[third jersey]]s".

== Background ==
Throwbacks were first popularized in [[Major League Baseball]], where teams not only wore renditions of their past styles, but also tributes to defunct [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] and [[Negro League]] baseball teams as well. Often, the games where teams will wear throwbacks are promoted as ''"Turn Back The Clock Nights"''. Throwbacks also make frequent appearances every season in [[college football]] games, [[National Hockey League]] games, and in [[National Basketball Association]] games.

The first companies to produce throwback uniforms were Tiedman &amp; Company Sportswear (college football, basketball, hockey, NFL and [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] soccer), Mitchell &amp; Ness (Major League Baseball), and Ebbets Field Flannels (Negro League baseball). All three companies are still in business; Tiedman &amp; Company relaunched in 2009 under the brand name Tiedman &amp; Formby [[Vintage (design)|Vintage]] Athletic Co..

In some instances, teams will wear "fauxbacks": retro designed uniforms harkening back to an era which pre-dates the team itself. For example, the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], formed in 1998, wore 1979-style baseball uniforms in 2012 (although they have used [[Tampa Tarpons]] and [[Tampa Smokers]] throwback jerseys),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chriscreamer.com/logo.php?id=egltsw8ih6uwg1iw7536i8lxu|title=Tampa Bay Rays Wordmark Logo – American League (AL) – Chris Creamer's Sports Logos Page – SportsLogos.Net|work=chriscreamer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dallas Mavericks]] have used a 1970s-like basketball uniform since 2004, despite having been established in 1980.  Fauxback can also refer to a retro style "vintage inspired" uniform that has design elements from a uniform from the past but is in itself a completely new and different design due to cosmetic adjustments.  An example of this is the current [[Buffalo Bills]] NFL team uniforms that feature helmets resembling the team's white helmets from the 1970s but with a different, more modern looking stripe design.

== American football ==

=== National Football League ===
Throwbacks were introduced in the [[National Football League|NFL]] in 1991 at retail through the NFL Throwbacks Collection.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} The rights to produce the vintage apparel was limited to six apparel licensees, including Tiedman &amp; Company Sportswear (exclusive to jerseys), Riddell (helmets), Starter (caps), Nutmeg Mills (sweatshirts), and DeLong (jackets). In [[1994 NFL season|1994]], to honor the NFL's 75th Anniversary, teams were allowed to wear modern versions of their old uniform styles.

{{Commons category|Throwback American football uniforms}}

However, the designs varied widely in their accuracy:
* While no attempt was made to simulate obsolete [[leather]] helmets which were phased out in the 1950s, teams simulating uniforms from the era of leather headgear simply removed all decals and striping from their regular hard-shell helmets.
* A rule imposed by the [[AFL–NFL merger]] in [[1970 NFL season|1970]] adopted the AFL's policy of all jerseys displaying the player's last name on the back side. This practice was not part of the NFL officially until after the merger, but in order to keep consistency with current rules, the names were placed on the back side of all throwback jerseys.
* In most instances the fonts and typestyles used were only approximate matches at best.
* The [[Arizona Cardinals]], [[Chicago Bears]] and [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] wore reproductions of uniforms that pre-dated large numerals on the front of jerseys, so instead smaller numerals were worn on the right shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Colosseum/Stadium/3028/pitt-v-colts.jpg&amp;date=2009-10-25+07:19:46&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Dallas Cowboys]] and Buffalo Bills received some criticism for their portrayal of their throwbacks. The Cowboys wore their early 1960s uniforms with their current helmet, while the Bills wore their then-current uniforms with the old "standing buffalo" logo in white on their red helmets, in place of the current blue "charging buffalo" logo. Later that season, the Cowboys used the "double-star" uniform, which could be considered an updated version of the 1960s jerseys. Ironically, both teams have since adopted these throwbacks more accurately as alternates, with Dallas now using the original, plain star helmet and Buffalo using the original red "standing buffalo" helmet on white background, as well as wearing the [[American Football League|AFL]]-era jerseys as opposed to the [[Jim Kelly]]/[[Marv Levy]]-era jerseys (the two jerseys have few noticeable differences other than sleeve stripes, which were present on the 1960s jerseys but not on the 1990s ones). The Bills adopted 1975-era throwbacks, with white helmets, as their main uniform in 2011. The [[New York Jets]] also received similar criticism for using their throwback logo on their then-current green helmets; when they adopted the throwback design full-time in 1998, they also went back to their original-style white helmets. The Bills and Cowboys did the same when they adopted their retro unis.
* The [[Miami Dolphins]], [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], [[Indianapolis Colts]] and [[Cleveland Browns]] had not had major uniform redesigns up to that point or only made subtle changes, as the Seahawks and Buccaneers had joined the league just 18 years earlier. The Seahawks and Buccaneers have also since redesigned their uniforms in 2002, 2012 and 1997, 2014 respectively, while the Dolphins made some minor updates in 1997, then a brand new look altogether in 2013, the Saints got new uniforms in 2000, and also the Browns in 2015.

[[File:Champ Bailey.JPG|thumb|[[Champ Bailey]] wearing a [[Denver Broncos]] throwback uniform in 2009]]
All the teams were informed that they would be wearing the Throwbacks during Week Three of the season. Some teams continued to wear theirs throughout the season. The [[San Francisco 49ers]] wore replicas of their 1955 uniforms in their [[Super Bowl XXIX]] victory. The uniforms were well-liked enough that the 49ers brought them back, in slightly modified form, for 1996–1997. In 1998, the gold pants from before were returned, in more modern form. In 2009, the team debuted an updated design of the 1980s uniforms that won them four of their five [[Super Bowls]].

Both of the NFL's New York City teams' throwbacks proved so popular with their fans that the teams returned to wearing them full-time soon afterwards: [[New York Jets|The Jets']] replicas of their 1968 uniforms (with a darker shade of green than before), and the [[New York Giants|Giants']] 1961 uniforms, with the lowercase "ny" instead of the underlined uppercase "GIANTS" – which was retained as a secondary logo – imposed after moving to East Rutherford, New Jersey. Both teams have modernized the 1960s decals for their current primary corporate logos.

As a result of the NFL modifying its rules to allow teams to wear alternate jerseys in 2002, throwbacks still make occasional appearances. The [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day games]] hosted by the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[Dallas Cowboys]] have been a showcase of throwbacks in recent years. The Bills, [[San Diego Chargers]] and Cowboys traditionally wear their early 1960s throwbacks twice each season.  Additionally, the Lions dropped their much criticized black alternates in favor of the popular 1940's and 1950s throwbacks (plain blue jersey, silver pants and helmets) in 2008. However;  due to the NFL's regulations about player safety and helmets both teams have ceased wearing the throwback uniforms. The Lions in 2011 and Cowboys in 2013.

The [[Cleveland Browns]] throwbacks are based on a uniform/helmet combination that first appeared in 1957 when [[Jim Brown]] was drafted. (Player numbers appeared on the side of the helmet that year.) The Browns began wearing their throwbacks in 2006 as part of the team's 60th Anniversary. They only wear them once per season.

The [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], who substantially changed their uniforms and team colors in 1997, never wore their orange throwbacks from 1997 to 2008. In [[2009 NFL season#Uniforms|2009]], the team wore their throwbacks for the first time against the [[Green Bay Packers|Packers]] on November 8 to debut the "Buccaneers' Ring of Honor." The club has continued to do so annually until 2014.

The [[San Diego Chargers]] wore their 1960s style powder-blue uniforms with white helmets as alternates from 2002 to 2006 and in 2007 adopted a modified version as their full-time uniforms. Meanwhile, the [[San Francisco 49ers]] wore their 1980s-style home red uniforms as throwbacks in 2002 (in 2005 the team re-designated them as alternate uniforms to be worn 1–2 home games a season). The team also petitioned the league to wear the throwbacks on the 2007 season opening night, as a tribute to their late former head coach [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]]. For the 2009 season, an updated design based heavily on the 1980s throwbacks was debuted by the 49ers, which was combined with the team's current modern logo. On September 16, 2007, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], celebrating their 75th season, wore a variation of their older early '60s uniforms that featured gold helmets with black stripe, black jerseys with gold numbers and stripes, and white pants with black-and-gold side stripes as they hosted Buffalo. They wore them again on [[Monday Night Football]] on November 5 against [[Baltimore Ravens|Baltimore]]. The Steelers enjoyed immense success in both games, winning each handily (26–3 vs. Buffalo, 38–7 vs. Baltimore), in direct contrast to the team's struggles when they wore those jerseys originally. On November 11, 2007, The New York Giants, wore their red uniforms against the division rival Dallas Cowboys. Also in 2007, the [[New York Jets]] twice wore replicas of their New York Titans uniforms – once against the [[Philadelphia Eagles]], and once against the [[Miami Dolphins]].  Since then, the Jets have worn the Titans uniforms several more times – twice in 2008, three times in 2009, and once in 2011.  For two of the 2009 games, the Jets wore white versions, replicating the Titans road uniforms.

The Eagles wore their powder blue and yellow throwback jerseys during the home game against the [[Detroit Lions|Lions]] on September 23, 2007. Though the Eagles had a big 56–21 victory, these particular Throwbacks were criticised as being very unattractive. During [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]] on [[NBC]] that week, [[Keith Olbermann]] named the Philadelphia Eagles the "Worst Persons in the NFL" for their blue-and-yellow throwback jerseys, citing "Throwbacks? Try ''throw-ups!''" The blue and yellow uniforms, which are the same colors as the flag of the City of [[Philadelphia]], were used by the Eagles, and their predecessors, the defunct [[Frankford Yellowjackets]] franchise, until the 1940s when the more familiar pre-[[Jeffrey Lurie]] era [[kelly green]] was introduced. The kelly green throwbacks from the 1960 season were wore for the 2010 season opener vs. the [[Green Bay Packers]] to commemorate the 50th anniversary of when the Eagles beat the Packers to win the [[1960 NFL Championship]].

For the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]], commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the [[American Football League]], the eight charter members of the AFL wore throwback uniforms from the early 1960s on select "Legacy Weekends." The Dallas Cowboys, also celebrating their 50th anniversary season, wore throwback jerseys for some games.

The Packers, starting in 2010, introduced their 1929 throwback uniforms as their alternative uniform. Honoring the Packers first ever championship team in 1929, the uniform features a navy blue jersey with yellow numbers, with an added twist, as the uniforms in 1929 featured a small yellow circle in the front with a blue number in it. The circle and numbers were enlarged to meet current NFL uniform rules. Complimenting the rest of the uniform were tan pants, replicating the canvas uniform pants used during the 1920s. The team switched to their 1940s uniforms for the 2015 season, which removed the yellow circle but retained the color scheme.

The NFL imposed a new rule for the [[2013 NFL season|2013 season]] prohibiting the use of alternate colored helmets, eliminating many of the historically accurate throwback uniforms that had been in use up to that point. Teams are still allowed to use alternate decals (or no decals at all) for their throwbacks, but they must use them on the regular helmets.&lt;ref&gt;Breech, John (September 17, 2013).

The [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]] [[college football]] team wore throwback uniforms for a single game during their [[2005 Texas Longhorns football team|2005 national championship season]] as a way of honoring the past.

The [[2008 Virginia Cavaliers football team|University of Virginia]] football team wore throwback uniforms in a single game on September 6, 2008, in honor of Virginia's teams from 1984 through 1993. The university's athletic department termed the game a "Retro Game" instead of using the term "throwback."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniformcritics.com/football/college/virginia-cavaliers/2008-uva-retro-unis/|title=2008 Virginia Retro Uniforms|date=8 June 2013|work=uniformcritics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2012 Virginia Cavaliers football team|University of Virginia]] football team also wore throwback uniforms in a single game on September 29, 2012, in honor of Virginia's 1968 team and [[Frank Quayle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniformcritics.com/football/college/virginia-cavaliers/2012-uva-retro-1968-unis/|title=2012 Virginia Throwback to 1968 Uniforms|date=9 July 2013|work=uniformcritics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2006 Florida Gators football team|University of Florida]] football team wore throwback uniforms in a single game on September 30, 2006, in honor of Florida's teams in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uniformcritics.com/football/college/florida-gators/2006-uf-throwback-unis/|title=2006 Florida Gators Throwback Uniform|date=8 June 2013|work=uniformcritics.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2009 and 2010 seasons, as part of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] Pro Combat program, several college football teams, including [[Ohio State Buckeyes football|Ohio State]] and [[Oregon State Beavers football|Oregon State]] wore throwback-inspired uniforms.  In addition, for the 2009 playing of the "Holy War" rivalry against the University of Utah Utes (and also in the [[Las Vegas Bowl]]), the BYU Cougars donned royal blue throwback uniforms to commemorate the 25th anniversary of their 1984 National Championship season.  These throwbacks, along with another alternate royal blue uniform, have been employed occasionally in subsequent seasons; since in 2014, they have been worn for the team's homecoming game each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865583954/BYU-to-wear-royal-blue-uniforms-for-Utah-game-on-Sept-21.html?pg=all|title=BYU to wear royal blue uniforms for Utah game on Sept. 21|first=Landon|last=Hemsley|date=1 August 2013|work=deseretnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'Retro shirts', as they are known in the United Kingdom, are also sometimes used in [[association football]], albeit with modern fabrics. In 2005–06 [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] changed their home colours from their traditional red and white to a variant of maroon known as redcurrant as a commemoration of their final season at [[Arsenal Stadium|Highbury Stadium]]; this colour was supposedly the same shade the team had worn when they first played at Highbury in 1913,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Kit Design| date=7 December 2007| publisher=[[Arsenal F.C.]]| url =http://www.arsenal.com/history/kit-design| accessdate = 17 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although later evidence suggested that Arsenal's main colour at that time was a more standard shade known as 'Garibaldi red'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Mark| last=Andrews| first2 =Andy|last2 =Kelly |title=Woolwich Arsenal in 1913 or is it? | date=February 8, 2013| work=The History of Arsenal |publisher=AISA Arsenal History Society | url =http://www.blog.woolwicharsenal.co.uk/archives/5358| accessdate = March 2, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Redcurrant, however, still played a part in their kits since; most recently on their yellow change kit featuring redcurrant shorts and pinstripes on the shirt and socks, between 2010 and 2012.

[[File:Paul Scholes vs Man City.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Paul Scholes]] and [[Owen Hargreaves]] in 2008, wearing 1958-style [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] kits to mark the 50th anniversary of the [[Munich air disaster]]]]
[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] wore several retro-style kits in the 1990s and 2000s, based on kits the worn by the club in the 1950s and '60s, as well as that worn by their first ever team, known then as ''Newton Heath''.  The Newton Heath-inspired kit was introduced for their centenary in 1992 and worn for two seasons as a third kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Manchester United Change Kits|url=http://historicalkits.co.uk/Manchester_United/Manchester_United-change-kits.html|work=historicalkits.co.uk|first=Dave|last=Moor|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wore a replica of their jersey from 1958 during the [[Manchester derby]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on February 10, 2008 at [[Old Trafford]] to mark the 50th anniversary of the [[Munich air disaster]] four days earlier. United were granted special dispensation by the [[Premier League]] to wear the one-off uniform which was devoid of logos and kit markings, and used the traditional "one to eleven" numbering scheme rather than using [[squad number (association football)|squad numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Oliver| last=Kay| title=Manchester United replicate 1958 kit to mark game of respect for Busby Babes| date=2007-12-07| publisher=The Times| url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/manchester_united/article3013603.ece| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a gesture of solidarity, Manchester City similarly removed the sponsor and manufacturer logos from their kits for the game, giving their shirts the same clean and empty look resembling the plain shirts of the 1950s when logos and team badges were not worn. However, they used the current season's kit style and chose not to go the whole distance in producing a retro-looking kit; retaining the club crest, competition sleeve patches, and the player name and squad number on the kit but added a [[black ribbon]] above the right breast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=City unveil shirts without sponsors for derby clash to mark Munich anniversary | date=2008-02-05 | work=[[Daily Mail]] | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-512438/City-unveil-shirts-sponsors-derby-clash-mark-Munich-anniversary.html | accessdate= 2013-09-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous season, [[2006–07 Manchester United F.C. season|2006–07]], United introduced a similar 1950s-style uniform to celebrate 50 years of the [[Busby Babes]]' first [[1955–56 Football League|league championship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=New home kit to be revealed on ManUtd.com | date=2006-07-07 | publisher=[[Manchester United F.C.]] | url=http://www.manutd.com/en/News-And-Features/Club-News/2006/Jul/New-home-kit-to-be-revealed-on-ManUtdcom.aspx | accessdate= 2013-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After their [[2008 UEFA Champions League Final|Champions League victory]] in 2008, United introduced another retro-style kit for [[2008–09 Manchester United F.C. season|2008–09]], celebrating the 40th anniversary of their first European Cup win.  The club unveiled an all-blue third kit, based on the one worn against [[S.L.

More authentic reproductions of kits from the past have become popular fashion items, especially jerseys linked to successful or memorable teams. When [[France national football team|France]] won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], their uniform was reminiscent of the design of the triumphant [[UEFA Euro 1984|Euro 1984]] team, with a red horizontal stripe and three thin horizontal stripes across the chest.

When the [[United States men's soccer team]] took the field between 1999 and 2001, their plain white uniform with a thick V-neck collar looked reminiscent of the [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer Federation]]'s first uniform worn in 1916. A similar uniform was produced in 2013, complete with vintage crest, to mark the 100th anniversary of the USSF.

For the FIFA Centenary Match in 2004, [[France national football team|France]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] played in kits resembling their first ever home kits.  The Brazilian team wore white tops with blue trim, the original colours of their home kit, which was replaced in 1951 by today's yellow top with green trim after the [[Uruguay v Brazil (1950 FIFA World Cup)|1950 World Cup defeat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Fifa centenary match France host Brazil  | date=2004-05-21 | work=[[The Guardian]] | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/may/21/newsstory.sport14 | first=Keir | last=Radnedge | accessdate= 2015-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] celebrated their 125th anniversary during the [[2007–08 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2007–08 season]] by launching a special kit in the club's early colours, sky blue and white, which were originally worn in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=125th ANNIVERSARY INSPIRES NEW PUMA SPURS KITS | date=17 May 2007 | work=[[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]] | url=http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com/news/125th-anniversary-inspires-new-puma-spurs-kits-170507/ | accessdate= 7 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The kit was worn for one game only, a 4–4 home draw to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Spurs Special Edition 125 Anniversary Kit | date=2 October 2007 | work=Football Shirt Culture | url=http://www.footballshirtculture.com/07/08-Kits/spurs-special-edition-125-anniversary-kit.html | accessdate= 7 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[2009–10 Premier League]], newly promoted [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] wore a redesigned version of their [[1959–60 Football League]] kits, when they last won the [[Football League First Division|then-First Division]].

[[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] celebrated the club's 125th anniversary in [[2010–11 Southampton F.C. season|2010–11]], by wearing the strip worn by the team's original forebears, which consisted of a white shirt with a red sash, white shorts and black socks.

During the later stages of the 2011–12 season, financially troubled Scottish club [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] wore their normal blue shirts on the pitch, but began selling and encouraging fans to wear throwback red and black striped scarves, the traditional colours of the burgh of Govan (where [[Ibrox Stadium]] is located) in an attempt to raise money.  The club would be placed in administration, face liquidation and then sold to a new ownership group, with a severe relegation penalty for the 2012–13 season.

English club [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] wore a replica of their [[1968 FA Cup Final]] kit, in their Premier League game against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] on 11 April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Jeff Astle charity launched on special West Bromwich Albion day | date= 2015-04-11 | publisher= [[BBC]] | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-32257003 | accessdate= 2015-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was worn to honour the match-winning goalscorer in the 1968 Cup Final, [[Jeff Astle]], who died in 2002 due to [[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] as a result of heading the heavy leather footballs through his career.  The kit used the 1–11 numbering system save for the goalkeeper's shirt, which was left blank as they were in those days.

2014–15 [[Scottish Championship]] winners [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.]] chose for their current season a replica of the shirt worn by the team 100 years ago, for the 1914–15 season. The shirt is plain maroon with a white collar and fly-button opening and has no sponsorship logos. Though the 1914–15 shirt bore no badge, the current shirt has an embroidered badge in the style of the club's logo of one hundred years ago. The shirt and badge also commemorate Hearts first and reserve teams, management and fans who, though currently topping the Scottish league, volunteered for the [[Great War]] effort en-masse in November 1914 to join a newly forming wartime volunteer infantry battalion, 16th Battalion [[Royal Scots]], commanded by [[George McCrae (politician)]] MP. Spurred on by Hearts, "[[McCrae's Battalion]]" also attracted players and supporters from other Scottish teams plus various sportsmen. The first football team to join up, Hearts and "McCrae's Battalion" were mentioned in thanks by Winston Churchill in Parliament and proved a catalyst in the formation of other football and sportsmen battalions of [[Kitchener's Army]]. Heart of Midlothian lost 7 players killed in the war, plus others maimed or gassed and unable to resume their careers after the war.

[[File:Port Adelaide Magpies Jumper.svg|thumb|110px|right|{{AFL Por}}'s heritage guernsey.]]
{{See also|Guernsey (Australian rules football)}}
Throwback uniforms, more commonly called '''heritage guernseys''', are worn occasionally by clubs in the [[Australian Football League]], mostly to commemorate the anniversaries of past successes or events. Between 2003 and 2007, there was an annual "Heritage Round", in which all clubs were encouraged to wear heritage guernseys from either their club or state.

The heritage guernsey of the [[Port Adelaide Football Club]] has been a regular source of controversy. The primary historical guernsey of the Port Adelaide Football Club, when it dominated national football the years before World War I and the [[South Australian National Football League]] for the 19th century, was black with a white "prison bars" design; however, when the club entered the Australia Football League in 1997, it was forced to change its colours to avoid a clash with the [[Collingwood Football Club]], who also wear black and white although in a different design. Whether or not Port Adelaide is permitted to wear its black and white guernsey in any heritage matches, even those not played against Collingwood, has been a point of contention between the clubs.

{{cquote|"It should have nothing to do with Eddie McGuire and Collingwood...I'll say that for a start."|15px|15px| [[Leigh Matthews]] during a discussion regarding Port Adelaide's traditional guernsey &lt;br /&gt;during the 2014 Elimination Final.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Matthews, 2014 AFL Elimination Final – Port Adelaide vs. Richmond, Channel 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The most recent instance of the club wearing the guernsey was during the Elimination Final of the [[2014 AFL season]].

In 1990, the [[Chicago White Sox]] wore replicas of their [[1917 World Series]] uniforms against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] as part of the White Sox celebration of the final season at [[Comiskey Park]]. During the game, the scoreboard and public address system were turned off, and the lineups announced with a hand-held megaphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=George| last=Bova| title=Memories of Old Comiskey Park: Turn Back the Clock Day July 11, 1990| publisher=White Sox Interactive | url =http://www.whitesoxinteractive.com/OldComiskey/TurnBackTheClock.html| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, these games have proven popular not only among team fans but also with viewers of TV highlight shows. [[ESPN]], for the highlights of the 1990 game, sped up the highlights and showed them in black and white to emulate the [[silent film]] of the era. The team then adopted a modified version of the 1959 "Go-Go Sox" era jerseys for the first year at [[Guaranteed Rate Field|the new Comiskey Park]] in 1991, having kept that design since and winning the [[2005 World Series]] in that design, ending an 88-year World Series championship drought.

With the introduction of [[interleague play]], when the [[Atlanta Braves]] played the [[Boston Red Sox]] for the first time in a regular season game in Boston in 1997, the teams wore uniforms that traced back to the initial season in which each team adopted the current nickname, the Braves wearing road uniforms from the 1912 season with the word 'BOSTON' and the Red Sox wearing 1908 uniforms with a large red sock with the word 'BOSTON' in white on the sock. It was the Braves' first official game against the Red Sox since the team moved to Milwaukee after the 1952 season. Braves manager Bobby Cox went on record as being firmly against his team being identified as 'Boston' by their uniforms.

Some throwback nights featured the [[Oakland Athletics]] wearing one combo or another of the gold/white/green uniform set it featured in the 1970s and 1980s, or the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]' black-and-gold combo from the same era – on June 26, 2010, they did so against one another, with Pittsburgh in black and Oakland in gold.

In 2003 the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] hosted the [[Baltimore Orioles]] with teams wearing retro St. Louis Cardinals and [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] (the predecessor to today's Orioles, which moved to Baltimore for 1954) uniforms, respectively. The scoreboard that day said "Browns" and the stadium announcer played along with the fantasy as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Matthew| last=Leach|author2=Gary Washburn  | title=Orioles turn back Cards| date=2003-06-07| publisher=[[MLB.com]]| url =http://www.mlb.com/news/wrap.jsp?ymd=20030607&amp;content_id=361373&amp;vkey=wrapup2003&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=null| work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-10-17 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2003, in commemoration of the 100th anniversary of the [[1903 World Series|first modern World Series]], the two participants in that game (the [[Boston Red Sox]] and the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]) met in a 3-game interleague series at [[PNC Park]] in [[Pittsburgh]]. While the Red Sox took two of three of those games with both teams wearing their standard uniforms, the one the Pirates won was meant to replicate their matchup in the 1903 World Series with both teams wearing 1903-era throwbacks. Although baseball teams did not have [[Squad number|uniform numbers]] at the time, to keep with the current rules numbers were put on the backs of the otherwise-accurate throwbacks. The [[JumboTron]] screen was left with a static background, and the scoreboard had the different team names at the time: the "Boston Americans" and the "[[Etymology of Pittsburgh|Pittsburg]] Pirates". The stadium crew at PNC Park also did other 1903-era activities such as using a [[megaphone]] for announcements.

In 2006 the [[New York Mets]], in honor of the 20th anniversary of the 1986 World Series, held a "turn-back-the-clock-night" and wore their 1986 uniforms.  In 2009 the Mets played three games of a four-game set against the [[San Francisco Giants]] in a "fauxback" jersey based on early 20th century New York Giants' jerseys with a giant "NY" on the chest, but using the Mets' current team colors of orange and blue. (The Mets are the only team to have worn a throwback from their home city's past instead of their franchise's past; while the [[Minnesota Twins]] and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], both of whom were once the Washington Senators, have each used throwbacks from their previous hometown, the city's current team, the [[Washington Nationals]], have worn both Twins-Senators and Rangers-Senators throwbacks as well.) In 2008, the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] adopted an alternate uniform based on their [[1948 Philadelphia Phillies season|1948]] uniforms, but with modern graphics on an off-white color background.

[[File:Aaron Miles (Dodgers throwback uniform).jpg|thumb|[[Aaron Miles]] in a throwback [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] uniform]]
Not all throwbacks use Major League uniforms; at least 15 MLB teams have at some point paid tribute to the pre-integration [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]] by wearing the uniform of a Negro League from the city's past; in almost every case both teams do so simultaneously. Since the [[Homestead Grays]] played "home" games in both Washington and Pittsburgh, the team has been honored as such by both the Nationals and Pirates; in 2008 the two teams did so together, with Washington wearing the Grays' home uniforms and Pittsburgh the away ones.

The [[Tampa Bay Rays]] have staged a "Turn Back the Clock" promotion with a retro theme and throwback uniforms almost every season of their existence. Because the franchise does not yet have a long history from which to choose uniforms, they have often worn the uniforms of historical local teams such as the [[Tampa Tarpons]] of the [[Florida State League]] (worn in 1999, 2006, and 2010), the [[St. Petersburg Pelicans]] of the [[Senior Professional Baseball Association]] (worn in 2008), the [[St. Petersburg Saints]] (2007) and [[Tampa Smokers]] (2011) of the [[Florida International League]], and the [[Tampa Spartans|University of Tampa Spartans]] (2000). The Rays have worn their own uniforms for Turn Back the Clock night only once: in 2009, when they wore Devil Rays "rainbow" uniforms from their 1998 inaugural season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/article1180400.ece "Rays have worn a variety of throwback uniforms"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016204058/http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/article1180400.ece |date=2012-10-16 }} ''St. Pete Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Usually, the Rays' opponent on Turn Back the Clock night wear throwbacks of their own from the same era as the Rays' retro uniforms. For example, the Houston Astros wore their 1980s "[[Rainbow Guts]]" uniforms, the Dodgers wore the 1955 road uniforms of the [[History of the Brooklyn Dodgers|Brooklyn Dodgers]], the Mets wore the road unis of their 1969 championship team, and the Orioles wore their rare all-orange uniforms from the early 1970s.

The [[San Diego Padres]] have also worn multiple throwback uniforms. Pre-1969 designs have represented the Padres of the [[Pacific Coast League]]. During the 2010 season, throwback uniforms were worn during all Thursday home day games. Multiple designs and color schemes were used, including the 1969 "first major league season" brown and gold, 1984 "first World Series" white with gold lettering and brown trim (and "RAK" on the sleeves for then-recently deceased owner Ray A. Kroc), and a 1990s era white with orange-trimmed blue lettering (while these were the accurate Padres jersey of the period, the design is also very similar to that of the [[New York Mets]], as the owners of the team at the time were investors from New York). All of these were fairly accurate representations of the team's uniforms and colors of the period, and in most games the visiting team wore throwback uniforms of a similar period. For example, at the final home game on September 30, the visiting [[Chicago Cubs]] and the Padres both wore 1984-era jerseys, in tribute to the 1984 NLCS, in which the same two teams played against each other.

In recent years, the Milwaukee Brewers have resurrected their old 1980s pinstriped uniforms with the old ball-in-glove "MB" logo on the caps for use as an alternate uniform.

In 2008, the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] unveiled their new "Flashback Friday" powder blue throwback uniforms, similar to those worn between the 1977 and 1979 seasons.

The [[Cleveland Indians]] throwbacks are usually worn once a year in July and normally are based on their uniforms from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s (most notably, their 1974 "All Red" home uniforms), They have also worn uniforms based on the 1948 Indians in honor of [[Larry Doby]], the first [[African Americans|African-American]] player in the [[American League]] with the Indians.

The 2011 [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] celebrated the tenth anniversary of their [[2001 World Series]] championship on September 9–11. To commemorate the event the Diamondbacks held a reunion of players who had been on the championship team. They also wore the purple, teal, and copper uniforms that the team wore from 1998 to 2006.

To celebrate the 100th anniversary of [[Fenway Park]], the [[New York Yankees]] and Boston Red Sox wore 1912 throwbacks during a regular-season game on April 20, 2012; the Yankees' 1912 uniforms were a nod to their days as the New York Highlanders.

In the [[1999 Major League Baseball season|1999 season]], MLB held a series of "[[Turn Ahead the Clock]]" nights. It was inspired by an independently held promotion on July 18, 1998 at a game between the [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]]. During those nights, teams wore uniforms envisioned as they might be in the year 2021. Twenty-two teams ultimately participated over 13 different games in 1999, with some teams wearing the uniforms more than once. The promotion proved unpopular, and has yet to be repeated since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/bullpen/Turn_Ahead_the_Clock_Night|title=Turn Ahead the Clock Night – BR Bullpen|work=baseball-reference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their [[1986 New York Mets season|1986 world championship season]], the [[New York Mets]] revived their 1986 uniforms to be used for all Sunday home games.

=== Other leagues ===
In [[1921 in baseball|1921]] a baseball game held at [[Rickwood Field]] as part of the Semicentennial of [[Birmingham, Alabama]] was played in "old-style" uniforms and according to "the rules of the games as they were in 1872.".&lt;ref name="Birmingham 1921"&gt;"Baseball Fans Given Rare Treat at Wood." (October 26, 1921) ''The Birmingham News''&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1996 Rickwood Field has been the site of the annual "Rickwood Classic", a regular season [[Birmingham Barons]] game in which both [[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]] teams wear uniforms honoring some period of their respective histories.

The [[Lotte Giants]] of the Korea Baseball Organization has "Again 1984/1992" day once per month in commemoration of their league titles from those respective years. The team dresses in their old baby blue jerseys as well as their old cap, complete with the old logo. The "Again 1984/1992" games are usually the most popular games of the year in Busan, with the stadium as well as the throwback merchandising usually selling out fast. Due to this success, starting in 2008, other teams in the league such as [[Doosan Bears]] and [[Samsung Lions]] have started to incorporate a similar style of throwback day as well.

The [[Buffalo Bisons]] of the International League adopted a throwback uniform as their main jersey in 2012 as part of their change in parent club affiliation to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]].

== Basketball ==

=== National Basketball Association ===
In the [[1996–97 NBA season]], the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary by introducing throwback jerseys, known as "Hardwood Classics". The [[Toronto Raptors]] were notable for wearing the uniforms of the long-defunct [[Toronto Huskies]], an original BAA team. The Raptors have since brought back this tradition on certain occasions, notably games against the [[New York Knicks]]. The [[Chicago Bulls]] wore script-logo throwbacks from the beginning of [[Michael Jordan]]'s career. Some of the throwbacks that were introduced in this season have been brought back on more occasions since, notably the [[Golden State Warriors]], whose throwback placed the players' numbers inside an angled [[cable car (railway)|cable car]] (a reference to San Francisco, where they had played in the early years in California).

In more recent years, throwback jerseys in the NBA have recalled some of the more gaudy uniforms of the NBA and the [[American Basketball Association (1967–76)|ABA]], ranging from the aforementioned Warriors uniforms, to the [[Detroit Pistons]]' [[Thunderbolt|lightning bolt]] uniforms of the [[Dick Vitale]] era of the late 1970s, to the [[Miami Floridians]] throwbacks worn by the [[Miami Heat|Heat]], and the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]]' 1980s era jerseys worn by [[Brad Daugherty (basketball)|Brad Daugherty]], [[Mark Price]], and [[Ron Harper]] as well as uniforms based on the early and mid-1970s. In contrast, the [[New York Knicks]] often wear throwback uniforms from the 1970s and 1980s that are understated by comparison. The warmups and uniform shorts of that era feature an "interlocking NY" identical to the one worn by the [[New York Yankees]] on their caps and home jerseys. Most "Hardwood Classics" jerseys worn by current players for games, however, are based on modern fabrics, and not the classic fabric designs of the past. The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] wore throwback short-shorts in 2007 for one game. Kobe Bryant complained, saying, "I feel violated. I feel naked. It's one thing to see those old guys wearing them on film, it's another to actually wear them". The [[Philadelphia 76ers]] began wearing throwback jerseys from their championship season of 1982–83 in 2007–08 to honor the 25th anniversary of their championship. They were so popular that the Sixers kept these jerseys for next year, and reverted to their old logo (modified with a newer "6") for the [[2009–10 NBA season|2009–10 season]].

The [[Orlando Magic]] are notable for wearing the same throwback design at least twice; their black pinstriped throwback was used in 2003–04, 2006–07 and 2009–10 seasons. They also wore the blue pinstriped throwbacks in 2004–05 and the white pinstriped throwbacks in 2005–06. The then-[[New Orleans Pelicans|New Orleans Hornets]], [[Charlotte Hornets|Charlotte Bobcats]], [[Los Angeles Clippers]], [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] and [[Memphis Grizzlies]] were also notable for wearing throwbacks of long-forgotten [[American Basketball Association]] franchises [[New Orleans Buccaneers]], [[Carolina Cougars]], [[Los Angeles Stars]], [[Minnesota Muskies]] and [[Memphis Sounds|Memphis Tams/Pros]]. The [[San Antonio Spurs]] also paid tribute to their predecessors [[Dallas Chaparrals]], while the Bulls and the [[Washington Wizards]] did the same to a pair of former Chicago-based NBA franchises, the [[Chicago Stags|Stags]] and Zephyrs.

The usage of throwback uniforms even inspired some NBA teams to acquire elements used from old uniform designs in creating new ones. For example, the [[Detroit Pistons]], [[Milwaukee Bucks]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] and [[Golden State Warriors]] reverted to their original color schemes while adding some accent colors to create a more modern look, while the Magic and the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] revived the use of pinstripes on their uniforms. The [[Dallas Mavericks]] briefly used a third jersey with the green, blue and white color scheme of the 1980s. The [[Houston Rockets]] revived the classic red and gold scheme in unveiling their new alternate uniform in 2009. The [[Utah Jazz]] are re-using their classic "J" note logo and a similar (though not the same) color scheme, and also plan to adopt a similar uniform design to what they originally wore from 1974 to 1996. The [[Washington Wizards]] also went retro, with secondary logos inspired from the old Bullets logos and the modernized "[[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]]" uniform worn from 1974 through 1987. The [[New York Knicks]] eliminated black from their color scheme and unveiled a modern adaptation of their 1970–75 uniforms, sans the shorts' side stripes, addition of silver trim, and a bolder, less arched "NEW YORK" script. The [[Sacramento Kings]] have used their classic Kansas City-era script to their gold and then black alternate uniforms. The [[Denver Nuggets]] revived the 'rainbow' uniforms from the 1980s as an alternate uniform, this time with the current colors and typeface, while the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]] wore alternate uniforms with a vertically arranged front script similar to those worn by the [[Oscar Robertson]]-era Cincinnati Royals. The [[Phoenix Suns]] paid tribute to the 1990s by unveiling new uniforms featuring a modified streaking sun.

In 2003, the [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball]] team wore throwback jerseys in home games against [[Kansas Jayhawks|Kansas]] and [[Missouri Tigers|Missouri]] to celebrate the program's 100th anniversary season. The jerseys were lavender with black letters and numerals, similar to the uniforms worn by [[Jack Hartman]]'s teams in the 1970s and 1980s, during some of KSU's best seasons.

The [[Kansas Jayhawks]] basketball team wore throwbacks in March 2005 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of [[Allen Fieldhouse]]. In February 2008 and February 2013, they wore throwbacks for the 20th and 25th anniversaries, respectively, of the [[1987–88 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1988 NCAA championship team]], and did so again in February 2012 to honor the [[1951–52 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|1952 NCAA championship team]]'s 60th anniversary.

== Box lacrosse ==
The [[Philadelphia Wings (1987–2014)|Philadelphia Wings]] indoor lacrosse team ditched their silver, red, and black uniforms for a game to wear their original [[Philadelphia Wings (1974–75)|orange and white jerseys worn in the early 1970s]] from the original [[National Lacrosse League (1974–75)|National Lacrosse League]]. For the 100th anniversary of [[Johns Hopkins – Maryland rivalry|the rivalry]] between [[Johns Hopkins Blue Jays men's lacrosse|Johns Hopkins]] and [[Maryland Terrapins men's lacrosse|Maryland]] in [[field lacrosse|men's lacrosse]], both teams wore special retro jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamondbackonline.com/home/index.cfm?event=displayArticlePrinterFriendly&amp;uStory_id=0a3ea5b0-8743-4f5c-842d-a7798060ccd0 Rivalry 101: Terps vs. Johns Hopkins], ''[[The Diamondback]]'', April 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 35th anniversary of women's field hockey at [[Dartmouth College]], the [[Dartmouth Big Green|Big Green]] are wearing a special harlequin-design throwback uniform.

== Canadian football ==

=== Canadian Football League ===
The first documented use of a throwback uniform came during the [[1998 Calgary Stampeders season|1998 season]], when the [[Calgary Stampeders]] wore [[1948 Calgary Stampeders season|1948]] red striped jerseys to celebrate the [[36th Grey Cup|first]] [[Grey Cup]] championship won by the Stampeders franchise. The jerseys were worn on October 4, 1998 against the [[BC Lions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/sports/former%20stamps%20owner%20gutsche%20dies/8915635/story.html|title=Former Stamps owner Sig Gutsche dies at 64|first=,Bryan|last=Weismiller|work=calgaryherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BC Lions were the next to wear throwback jerseys in [[2003 BC Lions season|2003]], as they were celebrating their 50th season with orange replica jerseys from the [[1954 BC Lions season]]. Those jerseys were worn four times that season with the first being the home opener that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4wnESgJUudk|title=CFL 2003 WINNIPEG BLUEBOMBERS AT BC-LIONS|first=|last=cflvideo1964|date=5 July 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, neither uniform was accurate as the jerseys were paired with pants and helmets from both teams' present day sets. In [[2007 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2007]], the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] wore green replica jerseys from the late 1960s to 1970s with double white striping over the shoulders. As opposed to the single season usage the Stampeders and Lions employed, the Roughriders wore these jerseys from 2007 to [[2013 Saskatchewan Roughriders season|2013]], including their usage in the [[97th Grey Cup|97th]] and [[98th Grey Cup]].

It wasn't until the [[2008 CFL season]] that the league started to truly embrace throwback uniforms when they announced that the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] and [[Toronto Argonauts]] would play two games (September 12 in [[Toronto]] and October 10 in [[Winnipeg]]) to celebrate and recognize the 1950s and in particular, the [[38th Grey Cup|1950 Mud Bowl Grey Cup game]].&lt;ref name="CFL 1950s"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2008/08/26/celebrating-our-legacy-the-cfl-goes-retro/|title=Celebrating Our Legacy: The CFL goes "Retro"|date=26 August 2008|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both teams wore coloured jerseys, as was common during the 1950s. Toronto's jerseys were a light blue in colour, with dark blue striping on the sleeves and the team's old "Pull Together" football-as-a-ship logo on the shoulders. The Blue Bombers' jerseys were dark blue in colour, with gold sleeve stripes. The team's 1950s-era logo was on the front of the jersey, just below the V in the neck. A special CFL "Retro Week" logo adorned each jersey as well, that logo being a take-off of the maple leaf one used as the league symbol from 1954 through 1969.

For the [[2009 CFL season]], all eight teams [[2009 CFL season#CFL retro|wore retro uniforms]], this time based on uniforms from the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2009/04/07/cfl-retro-celebrating-the-sixties/|title=CFL Retro: Celebrating the Sixties|date=7 April 2009|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Week 3 of the 2009 season featured all teams wearing their retro uniforms. When revealed at the time, four teams had white retro jerseys and four had coloured retro jerseys. As the season progressed, Saskatchewan added a green 1960s jersey for the [[Labour Day Classic]] and Calgary wore a white 1960s jersey for the Labour Day rematch versus [[Edmonton Eskimos|Edmonton]]. 11 games were scheduled during the season to feature both teams wearing these uniforms while more were added later on.

In [[2010 CFL season|2010]], all eight teams again [[2010 CFL season#CFL retro|wore retro uniforms]] and for this season it was based on uniforms worn from the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2010/01/30/kicking-off-2010-schedule-with-momentum/|title=Kicking off 2010 schedule with momentum|date=30 January 2010|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams wore retro uniforms during weeks 6 and 7, however, contrary to the previous year, only the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] wore white throwback uniforms, meaning most teams wore their regular white uniforms as the away team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/2010/07/14/riders-set-to-celebrate-retro-style/|title=Riders set to celebrate retro style|date=14 July 2010|work=cfl.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roughriders wore their regular 1970s throwback jersey during retro games they hosted. Additionally, during this season, the Roughriders were celebrating their 100th anniversary as a franchise and wore black, red, and silver throwback uniforms similar to the ones worn by the Regina Roughriders from 1912 to 1947. These uniforms were worn on July 17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riderville.com/2010/06/15/riders-unveil-retro-jerseys/|title=Riders unveil Retro Jerseys|date=15 June 2010|work=riderville.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the league had originally planned to celebrate with retro uniforms each season leading up to the [[100th Grey Cup]], the CFL did not introduce 1980s-themed uniforms for the [[2011 CFL season]].&lt;ref name="CFL 1950s" /&gt; Some teams (Calgary, Saskatchewan, Toronto, and Winnipeg) continued wearing the previous year's retro uniforms while the rest wore no throwback uniforms at all. In [[2012 CFL season|2012]], all teams remodeled their full uniform set with only Saskatchewan and Winnipeg carrying over their 1970s throwback uniforms.

In [[2013 CFL season|2013]], the Toronto Argonauts wore 1980s throwback uniforms on August 23, 2013 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the [[71st Grey Cup]] championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerscentre.com/events/article.jsp?content=20130822_143039_5108|title=Rogers Centre – Events – ARGONAUTS HOST STAMPEDERS IN 100TH GREY CUP REMATCH THIS FRIDAY NIGHT|work=rogerscentre.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] wore red, black, and white replicas of the 1943 [[Hamilton Flying Wildcats]] to celebrate the 70th anniversary of their [[31st Grey Cup]] victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespec.com/sports-story/4059672-ticats-to-pay-homage-to-flying-wildcats-with-historic-uniforms/|title=Ticats to pay homage to Flying Wildcats with historic uniforms|date=3 September 2013|publisher=|via=The Hamilton Spectator}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, the uniforms from these games were worn only once. The Winnipeg Blue Bombers wore 1980s-themed uniforms from 2013 to 2015 before switching full-time to similar royal blue jerseys in 2016. The Roughriders introduced new throwback uniforms based on the uniforms from the early 1980s in 2014 and wore them again in 2015. The franchise introduced another green retro-styled jersey in 2016, but due to lack of numbers on the shoulders, were never actually worn before in their history.

As of the [[2015 CFL season]], the Saskatchewan Roughriders, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, and Toronto Argonauts have worn throwback uniforms representing four different decades, which is the most in the league. The Roughriders have worn six different throwback jerseys, including two white jerseys, which is also the most in the league. No Ottawa franchise ([[Ottawa Rough Riders]], [[Ottawa Renegades]], and [[Ottawa Redblacks]]) has ever worn a throwback uniform, presumably due to their checkered absences from the league over the past 20 years.

== Cricket ==
In February 2005 at [[Eden Park|Eden Park, Auckland]], [[Australia national cricket team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] contested the very first [[Twenty20 cricket]] international match. Both teams appeared in retro 1980s-style tight-fitting [[One Day International|one day international]] uniforms without team names, numbers or sponsors' logos. The Australians wore their original "yellow and gold" whilst New Zealand were in "beige" inspired by the [[Beige Brigade]] sports fans. The game was played in a light-hearted manner with both teams sporting 1980s-style head bands, moustaches and hairstyles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ci/content/image/163829.html|title=Cricket Photos – Latest cricket images – ESPN Cricinfo|work=cricinfo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cycling ==
When [[Lance Armstrong]] won his fifth Tour de France championship, in 2003, his [[U.S. Postal Service]]-sponsored team wore a special jersey sporting the old U.S. Mail logo from the 1970s for the final day of the race. This was not technically a throwback jersey, as the team itself did not exist in that era, and had only been affiliated with USPS since 1998.

== Ice hockey ==

=== National Hockey League ===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}
Throwbacks were first introduced in the [[National Hockey League]] in their 75th [[anniversary]] season of [[1991–92 NHL season|1991–92]]. At the time, only the [[Original Six]] teams wore throwbacks, although they were also used in the All-Star game.

While the NHL had long since replaced the heavy wool sweaters with more modern air-knit jerseys, the patterns for the 75th anniversary throwbacks were consistent with the original versions, with a few exceptions (as noted below). Player surnames were worn on the back of the throwback jerseys, even though this was not originally the case (the NHL did not require names on the jerseys until 1977).

The Original Six teams' throwbacks included the following modifications:
* [[Boston Bruins]] – c. 1927 through 1931 "shield logo" design &lt;br /&gt; The Bruins' colors were brown and gold during this era, but the throwback jerseys use a "basic black" scheme with a small amount of white and gold trim, with the "shield logo" on the front of the jersey, and the "spoked-B" modern day regular logo placed on the jersey shoulders. For the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|Winter Classic]] that they hosted at [[Fenway Park]] on January 1, [[2009–10 NHL season|2010]], they wore adapted replicas of the first "Spoked B" logo from 1947 to 1948 on the 1955–58 gold jerseys.
* [[Chicago Blackhawks]] – c. 1940 design &lt;br /&gt; The Blackhawks' "[[barber pole]]" design was used one more time, in a game against Detroit at [[Chicago Stadium]] in January 1994. A c.-1936 design, featuring beige in the color scheme, was used in the [[2009 NHL Winter Classic]] on January 1, [[2008–09 NHL season|2009]] at [[Chicago]]'s [[Wrigley Field]]; it would become the team's third jersey for the [[2009–10 NHL season|2009–10 season]].
* [[Detroit Red Wings]] – c. 1928 design &lt;br /&gt; At the time the design was originally worn, the Red Wings were known as the Cougars. They wore their throwbacks again in the aforementioned game at Chicago Stadium in 1994. (The design was also used by [[Wayne Gretzky]]'s team of All-Stars that toured Europe during the [[1994–95 NHL lockout]], and by the [[Adirondack Red Wings]] as a [[third jersey]]). For the Winter Classic in 2009, the Wings donned a modified version of their inaugural 1926 sweater, which featured a single red stripe across the chest with a stylized "D" in the center, along with the current winged wheel logo to the shoulders.
* [[Montreal Canadiens]] – c. 1926 design &lt;br /&gt; The Canadiens' red jerseys have changed very little. The differences between the throwback and their current jersey were the crew collar and the duplicate Canadiens logo on the left sleeve. Three "retro" jersey designs from the Canadiens' past were authorized as part of the team's centennial celebration in 2009, including a "barber pole" design of red, white and blue horizontal stripes.
* [[New York Rangers]] – c. 1940 design &lt;br /&gt; This jersey was notable because it was of the style the Rangers wore when they had last won the [[Stanley Cup]]. (They won the cup again [[1994 Stanley Cup Finals|two years later]].)
* [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] – c. 1940 design &lt;br /&gt; The two-stripe design was used for many years by the Maple Leafs, and after over two decades of the single-stripe design, the Leafs adopted a new version of the two-stripe design the following season.
* [[Wales Conference]] All-Stars – c. 1952 design (white)
* [[Campbell Conference]] All-Stars – c. 1952 design (red) &lt;br /&gt; The stripes running down the sleeves of the All-Star jerseys were wider than those on the original versions.

As other leagues began using throwbacks, interest in retro jerseys increased within the NHL. To celebrate new ownership, the [[New York Islanders]] wore a modified throwback design for one game in 1998. The [[Buffalo Sabres]] pulled a similar stunt for a game in 2003. The Toronto Maple Leafs also brought back a 1960s-era jersey as a [[third jersey]] beginning in [[1998–99 NHL season|1998–99]]. In [[2003–04 NHL season|2003–04]], the NHL implemented a Vintage program, allowing several teams to wear throwback uniforms that were specially branded with a vintage "V" patch. The following teams were among those that participated in the program:
* [[Boston Bruins]] – c. 1970s uniforms &lt;br /&gt; These were notable as the [[Bobby Orr]]-era uniforms. The black throwbacks would replace the gold third jerseys in [[2006–07 NHL season|2006]].
* [[Edmonton Oilers]] – c. 1990s uniforms &lt;br /&gt; The current Oilers only wore the white uniforms once, for the [[2003 Heritage Classic|Heritage Classic]]. The Oilers alumni wore the blue version for the preceding MegaStars game. For 2008–09, this uniform served as the Oilers' third jersey and became the team's primary jersey in 2009–10.
* [[Los Angeles Kings]] – c. 1977 uniforms
* [[Montreal Canadiens]] – c. 1946 (white), c. 1960 (red) &lt;br /&gt; The white throwbacks, similar in design to the red jersey with its blue-and-white stripe across the chest, continued to be worn as an alternate jersey in subsequent seasons. The red throwbacks featured a tie-up collar, a design feature that has seen a comeback in recent years, although it's there strictly for aesthetic purposes.
* [[New York Islanders]] – [[1972–73 NHL season|1972–73]] &lt;br /&gt; This uniform, from the team's first season featured similar-(though not the same)colored numbers on similar (though not the same)-colored trim against a royal blue background, serving as the 2008–09 and 2009–10 third jersey, was elevated to their full-time home uniform in 2010–11.
* [[New York Rangers]] – c. 1977 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; This uniform featured the team's shield logo instead of "RANGERS" written diagonally across the chest. Ironically, these throwback jerseys were actually newer in design than their regular jerseys.
* [[St. Louis Blues]] – c. 1979 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; Their then-current uniforms, introduced in 1998, were at least partially inspired by these uniforms.
* [[Vancouver Canucks]] – c. 1977 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; The blue throwbacks would replace their screen-printed red/blue alternate in 2006. These throwbacks served as the basis for Vancouver's new uniforms in 2007.
* [[Philadelphia Flyers]] – c. 1974 uniforms &lt;br /&gt; The first two times the Flyers wore these jerseys, the numbers were the same as the old ones. The numbers on the throwbacks worn in 2008–09 are the same as the numbers on their current road and third jerseys. These will serve as the Flyers' primary home jerseys for the 2009–10 season; a white version was used for the Winter Classic at Fenway Park January 1; these will serve as of 2010–11 as their road uniforms.

A few teams also introduced "fauxback" uniform (a term that was coined by Paul Lukas, the creator of the Uni Watch column and blog, for a uniform design not worn in the past, but given the appearance of decades-old vintage) designs as alternate jerseys. The [[Colorado Avalanche]] introduced burgundy third jerseys similar in design to the [[New York Rangers]]' blue ones, while the [[Minnesota Wild]] introduced a red alternate featuring a logo encased in a circle containing the team's name, a feature previously used by the Blackhawks and [[Pittsburgh Penguins]]. The [[2004 National Hockey League All-Star Game]] also featured faux throwback designs. The Sabres introduced a "fauxback" jersey designed as an homage to its [[American Hockey League]] predecessor, the [[Buffalo Bisons (AHL)|Bisons]], in 2010 and wore it as their third jersey until 2012.

The Bruins, Canadiens, Maple Leafs, and Canucks used their throwbacks through [[2006–07 NHL season|2006–07]]. The [[Buffalo Sabres]] also wore a throwback blue-and-gold jersey for one season, bringing it back again in 2008–09, and making it their 2009–10 home sweater. Although third jerseys were temporarily discontinued for [[2007–08 NHL season|2007–08]] so that teams could get used to the new [[Rbk Edge]] uniforms (third jerseys returned for the [[2008–09 NHL season|2008–09 season]]), Boston and Vancouver have adopted new uniforms that are based on their throwback designs.

On January 1, 2008, the Sabres and the Penguins donned throwback uniforms in the [[AMP Energy NHL Winter Classic]] at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] in [[Orchard Park, New York]], albeit with [[Reebok]]'s "Edge" [[Pattern (sewing)|design template]]. The Penguins also used the throwbacks as their third jersey for the 2008–09 season. And as mentioned earlier, at the 2009 NHL Winter Classic, the Blackhawks and the Red Wings wore throwback replicas at Wrigley Field and the Flyers and Bruins donned retro schemes at Fenway Park in 2010. For the 2011 game, the Penguins (1967–68) and their opposition, the [[2010–11 Washington Capitals season|Washington Capitals]] (1974–75) are expected to wear their first season replicates.

In recent years, [[CCM (The Hockey Company)|CCM]], now owned by Reebok, has made additional replica throwbacks available for sale, in addition to those in current use. 1992 throwbacks such as Detroit's and Chicago's were among those reissued, while others included older-era jerseys of current NHL teams the [[Phoenix Coyotes]], the [[Colorado Avalanche]], the [[Dallas Stars]], the [[Carolina Hurricanes]] and the [[New Jersey Devils]] when they had played in their former markets of (Winnipeg, Quebec City, Bloomington, Minnesota, Hartford and Denver). The much-maligned "Flying-V" uniforms of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] were also reissued. The Winnipeg jerseys were particularly popular and were seen throughout Winnipeg after it became clear that a new [[Winnipeg Jets]] franchise would be established in 2011; Jets jerseys were prevalent at the [[2011 NHL Draft]], where the new Jets' name was revealed.

'''''Trump: The Art of the Deal''''' is a 1987 book credited to [[Donald Trump]] and journalist [[Tony Schwartz (author)|Tony Schwartz]]. Part [[memoir]] and part business-advice book, it was the first book credited to Trump,&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Ralph Novak|date=February 29, 1988|title=Picks and Pans Review: ''Trump: the Art of the Deal''|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20098358,00.html|accessdate=November 21, 2014|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped to make him a "household name".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speaking Freely: My Life in Publishing and Human Rights|last=Bernstein|first=Robert|publisher=The New Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/magazine/the-trump-of-magazines-past.html|title=The Trump of Magazines Past|last=Ligman|first=Kyle|date=2016-05-18|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2016-07-18|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached number 1 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]], stayed there for 13 weeks, and altogether held a position on the list for 48 weeks.&lt;ref name=ghost/&gt;

The book received additional attention during [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump's 2016 campaign for the presidency of the United States]]. He cited it as one of his proudest accomplishments and his second-favorite book after the [[Bible]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/424567/art-deal-trump-shows-his-soft-side-jim-geraghty|title=In The Art of the Deal, Trump Shows His Soft Side|author=Jim Geraghty|date=September 24, 2015|work=[[The National Review]]|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.com/all-in/watch/donald-trumps-favorite-book-505029187689|work=MSNBC|title=Donald Trump reveals his favorite book|access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz expressed regrets about his involvement in the book, and both he and the book's publisher, [[Howard Kaminsky]], said that Trump had played no role in the actual writing of the book. Trump has given conflicting accounts on the question of authorship.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt;

== Synopsis ==
The book talks about Trump's childhood in [[Jamaica Estates, Queens]]. It then describes his early work in [[Brooklyn]] prior to moving to [[Manhattan]] and building [[The Trump Organization]], his actions and thoughts in developing the [[Grand Hyatt Hotel]] and [[Trump International Hotel and Tower (New York City)|Trump Tower]], in renovating [[Wollman Rink]], and regarding various other projects.&lt;ref&gt;Trump: The Art of the Deal Paperback&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contains an 11-step formula for business success, inspired by [[Norman Vincent Peale]]'s ''[[The Power of Positive Thinking]]''.&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axK-7t8kolQC&amp;pg=PT69 |title=TrumpNation: ''The Art of Being The Donald'' |publisher=Grand Central Publishing |author=Timothy L. O'Brien |year=2005 |pages=69–70 |accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Trump was persuaded to produce the book by [[Condé Nast]] owner [[Si Newhouse]] after the May 1984 issue of Newhouse's magazine ''[[GQ]]'' – with Trump appearing on the cover – sold well.&lt;ref name=obrien/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''GQ''. May 1984. Success Issue. Donald Trump, [[Sandra Bernhard]], [[Bobby Short]].&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz was hired to work on the book, and began working with Trump in late 1985. He interviewed Trump and – with permission from him – listened in on his phone calls.

According to Schwartz in July 2016, Trump wrote none of the book, choosing only to remove a few critical mentions of business colleagues at the end of the process.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt; Trump responded with conflicting stories, saying "I had a lot of choice of who to have write the book, and I chose [Schwartz]", but then said "[Schwartz] didn't write the book. ''I'' wrote the book."&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt; Former [[Random House]] head [[Howard Kaminsky]], the book's original publisher, said "Trump didn’t write a postcard for us!"&lt;ref name="ghost"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all|title=Donald Trump’s Ghostwriter Tells All|last=Mayer|first=Jane|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=July 25, 2016|accessdate=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was published in November 1987 by Random House, with the authorship given as "Donald Trump with Tony Schwartz". 

Schwartz was the subject of a July 2016 article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' in which Schwartz describes Donald Trump unfavorably and relates how he came to regret writing ''The Art of the Deal''.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt; He also stated that if it were to be written today it would be very different and titled ''The Sociopath''.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt; Schwartz repeated his self-criticism on ''[[Good Morning America]]'', saying he had "put lipstick on a pig".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winsor|first1=Morgan|title=Tony Schwartz, Co-Author of Donald Trump's 'The Art of the Deal,' Says Trump Presidency Would Be 'Terrifying'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/tony-schwartz-author-donald-trumps-art-deal-trump/story?id=40662196|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=July 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these claims, Trump's attorneys have demanded that Schwartz cede all his royalties from the book to Trump.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/us/politics/trump-tony-schwartz-book.html|title=Trump Lawyer Sends ‘Art of the Deal’ Ghostwriter a Cease-and-Desist Letter|last=Fandos|first=Nicholas|date=2016-07-21|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/donald-trump-threatens-the-ghostwriter-of-the-art-of-the-deal|title=Donald Trump Threatens the Ghostwriter of 'The Art of the Deal'|date=2016-07-21|website=The New Yorker|access-date=2016-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication==
''The Art of the Deal'' was published in November 1987 by [[Random House]]. A promotional campaign was undertaken in conjunction with the release of the book. This included Trump holding a release party at [[Trump Tower]] that was hosted by [[Jackie Mason]] and featured a celebrity-filled guest list.&lt;ref name = obrien /&gt; There were a series of appearances by him on television talk shows.&lt;ref name="qiu"/&gt; Trump also appeared on a number of magazine covers as part of publicity for the book.&lt;ref name="qiu"/&gt;

Excerpts from the book were published in [[New York magazine|''New York'']] magazine.
The book has been translated into over a dozen languages.&lt;ref name = obrien /&gt;

==Royalties==
Trump and Schwartz had an agreement to split royalties from the book on a 50–50 basis.&lt;ref name="mixed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Farenthold"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-promised-millions-to-charity-we-found-less-than-10000-over-7-years/2016/06/28/cbab5d1a-37dd-11e6-8f7c-d4c723a2becb_story.html|title=Trump promised millions to charity.

In 1988, Trump set up the [[Donald J. Trump Foundation]] to give away royalties from the book's sales, in Trump's words, promising four or five million dollars "To the homeless, to Vietnam veterans, for AIDS, multiple sclerosis".&lt;ref name="mixed"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/donald-trump-book-royalties-to-charity-a-mixed-bag/|title=Donald Trump book royalties to charity? A mixed bag|date=August 11, 2016|work=CBS News|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Farenthold"/&gt; According to a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' investigation those donations largely did not happen: the paper said "he gave less to those causes than he did to his older daughter's ballet school."&lt;ref name="Farenthold"/&gt; ''The Washington Post'' asked Trump's campaign if Trump had donated the $55,000 Trump earned in the first six months of 2016 to charity, as he promised in the 1980s, and it did not respond.&lt;ref name="Farenthold2"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/10/04/trumps-co-author-on-the-art-of-the-deal-donates-55000-royalty-check-to-charity |title=Trump’s co-author on ‘The Art of the Deal’ donates $55,000 royalty check to charity |work=[[Washington Post]] |author=David A. Fahrenthold |date=October 4, 2016 |accessdate=October 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2016, Schwartz said he had received some $1.6 million in royalty payments.&lt;ref name="mixed"/&gt; In October of that year, Schwartz said the royalties he was still receiving for the book "suddenly became, for me, blood money. I didn't want to be anywhere near it. It just feels wrong".&lt;ref name="Farenthold2"/&gt; As a result, Schwartz said he would be donating the prior 6-months of royalties worth $55,000 to the [[National Immigration Law Center]] which advocates for more undocumented immigrants to remain in the USA legally. Schwartz had earlier donated royalties he received in the second half of 2015, worth $25,000, to a number of charities including the [[National Immigration Forum]]. Schwartz said he wanted to help the people Trump was attacking.&lt;ref name="Farenthold2"/&gt;

==Book sales==
Precise figures for the number of copies sold of ''The Art of the Deal'' are not available because its publication preceded the [[Nielsen BookScan]] era.&lt;ref name="qiu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/06/donald-trump/donald-trumps-art-deal-best-selling-business-book-/ |title=Is Donald Trump's ''Art of the Deal'' the best-selling business book of all time? |work=[[Politifact]]| publisher = [[Tampa Bay Times]]|author=Linda Qiu |date=July 6, 2015 |accessdate=July 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had a [[Edition (book)#First edition|first printing]] of 150,000 copies. Several magazine and book accounts state that it sold over 1 million hardcover copies&lt;ref name="obrien"/&gt; or 1 million copies.&lt;ref name="ghost"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-business-philosophy-from-the-art-of-the-deal-2015-6|title=Donald Trump's core business philosophy from his bestselling 1987 book 'The Art of the Deal'|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2016 [[CBS News]] investigation reported that an unnamed source familiar with the book's sales placed the figure at 1.1 million copies sold.&lt;ref name="mixed"/&gt;

Trump said in his [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential run]] that ''The Art of the Deal'' is "the No. 1 selling business book of all time." An analysis by ''[[Politifact]]'' found that other business books sold many more copies than ''The Art of the Deal''. While it was impossible to find exact sales figures, a range of possibilities based on known claims and facts were given, and when compared to six other famous business books, ''The Art of the Deal'' ranked in fifth place according to the analysis; the first place book, ''[[How to Win Friends and Influence People]]'', outsold it by a factor of 15 times.&lt;ref name="qiu"/&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
At the time of publication, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' called it a "boastful, boyishly disarming, thoroughly engaging personal history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-394-55528-7|title=Trump: The Art of the Deal|author=|date=December 1987|work=[[Publishers Weekly]]|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine gave it a mixed review.&lt;ref name="people"/&gt;

In 1988, Trump and [[Ted Turner]] announced plans for a television-film based on the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1988-07-04/features/8801120710_1_ted-turner-superstation-nielsen|title=Turner And Trump Team Up For A Film|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plans had been largely abandoned by 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1991-07-19/features/1991200182_1_turner-trump-make-a-movie|title=Turner's Trump movie is on hold|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years later, journalist [[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]] noted Trump "appears to have ignored some of his own advice" in the book due to "well-publicized problems with his banks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/06/nyregion/art-of-the-deal-scaled-back-edition.html|title='Art of the Deal,' Scaled-Back Edition|author=John Tierney|date=March 6, 1991|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump's self-promotion, best-selling book and media celebrity status led one commentator in 2006 to call him "a poster-child for the '[[greed is good]]' 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=icY_SPvVBO0C&amp;pg=PA101|title=Journalism at the End of the American Century, 1965-present|author=James Brian McPherson|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2006|page=101|accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The phrase "Greed is good" was from the movie [[Wall Street (1987 film)|''Wall Street'']], which was released a month after ''The Art of the Deal''.)

[[Jim Geraghty]] in the ''[[National Review]]'' said in 2015 that the book showed "a much softer, warmer, and probably happier figure than the man dominating the airwaves today."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

John Paul Rollert, an [[ethicist]] writing about the book in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' in 2016, says Trump sees capitalism not as an economic system but a [[morality play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/03/an-ethicist-reads-the-art-of-the-deal/475605/|title=An Ethicist Reads The Art of the Deal|author=John Paul Rollert|date=March 30, 2016|work=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=April 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Truthful hyperbole}}The book coined the phrase "truthful hyperbole" describing "an innocent form of exaggeration—and... a very effective form of promotion". Schwartz said Trump loved that phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/07/25/donald-trumps-ghostwriter-tells-all|title=Donald Trump's Ghostwriter Tells All|last1=Mayer|first1=Jane|date=25 July 2016|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Page"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/page/ct-alternative-facts-kellyanne-conway-trump-perspec-0125-20170124-story.html|title=Column: 'Alternative facts' play to Americans' fantasies|last=Page|first=Clarence|date=January 24, 2017|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=January 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2017, the phrase was noted for its similarity to the phrase "[[alternative facts]]" coined by [[Counselor to the President]] [[Kellyanne Conway]] when she defended [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]]'s statements about the attendance at Trump's [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] as [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pennlive.com/opinion/2017/01/memo_to_kellyanne_conway_-_alt.html|title=Memo to Kellyanne Conway, there is no such thing as 'alternative facts': John L.

Aspects of the book were used as the basis for the 2016 [[parody film]], ''[[Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie]]''.&lt;ref name="latimes_parody"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-trump-parody-funny-or-die-20160211-story.html|title=Funny or Die 'Donald Trump' filmmakers talk about making the viral parody with Johnny Depp|last1=Zeitchik|first1=Steven|date=February 10, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, the New York Times published an investigation contradicting many of the claims made by the Book, particularly the assertion that Donald Trump is a self made billionaire. The investigation details how Trump received at least $413 million in today’s dollars from his father's real estate empire, rather than the $1 million stated in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/10/02/us/politics/donald-trump-tax-schemes-fred-trump.html|title=Trump Engaged in Suspect Tax Schemes as He Reaped Riches From His Father|last=Barstow|first=David|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/02/trump-committed-fraud-in-tax-schemes-new-york-times-says.html|title=Trump committed 'outright fraud' in 'dubious tax schemes,' according to a big, new NYT investigation|last=Pramuk|first=Jacob|date=2018-10-02|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-tax-fraud-fred-million-1149639|title=Donald Trump committed tax fraud to make equivalent of $413 million off his father Fred, report says|date=2018-10-02|work=Newsweek|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/2/17929774/donald-trump-tax-evasion-fred-trump-new-york-times|title=A NYT investigation destroys Trump’s "self-made" image and alleges sketchy tax schemes|work=Vox|access-date=2018-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Tseten Dorjee was born 2 December 1960 in Tibet and went in exile in India&lt;ref&gt;Martin J. Kidston, [http://helenair.com/lifestyles/tibetan-artists-in-exile-at-home-in-basin/article_241f2195-44f6-556e-86ca-d97db96ea6f6.html Tibetan artists in exile at home in Basin] , July 24, 2005, [[Independent Record]]&lt;/ref&gt; to receive his early education at the Central School for Tibetans, in [[Darjeeling]], India. Dorjee started the study of [[thangka]] painting between 1974 and 1980 when he took private lessons from the late Venerable [[Ngawang Norbu]] (1903–1996). He continued his study from 1980 to 1986 at the Gyudmed Tantric Monastery, located in [[Mysore]], South India.

Dorjee became a faculty member of [[Naropa University]]'s Study Abroad Program in Sikkim in the fall of 2002. Its Director, Clarke D. Warren, stated, “Being a scholar of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] I have been an avid connoisseur of thangka painting for many years and Tseten is amongst the finest I have seen anywhere, in its mastery of tradition, style and execution.”

== History ==

The company was founded by Alex Farkas, Stephen Tanenbaum and Greg Rosborough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = College Business Plans that Made the Grade|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/182608|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three met in a business class at the [[University of Arizona]]. Sharing an interest in the arts, they developed the concept for UGallery through the McGuire Entrepreneurship Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = McGuire Program grad UGallery continues to connect people and art|url = https://entrepreneurship.eller.arizona.edu/news-article/mcguire-program-grad-ugallery-continues-connect-people-and-art|website = McGuire Center for Entrepreneurship|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UGallery.com website launched in September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Get Schooled|url = http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/167156|website = Entrepreneur|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally seen as a way to help recent [[art school]] graduates find buyers, UGallery began with five artists and 25 pieces of [[Contemporary art|original art]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Conversation With UGallery Co-Founders Alex Farkas and Stephen Tanenbaum|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonborbet/2015/06/04/a-conversation-with-ugallery-co-founders-alex-farkas-and-stephen-tanenbaum/|website = Forbes|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Securing outside capital in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ugallery Funding &amp; Ugallery Investors – CB Insights|url = https://www.cbinsights.com/company/ugallery-funding|website = www.cbinsights.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the company shifted its focus to mid-career and emerging artists from around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gallery ===
As of February 2014, UGallery exhibits the work of 500 professional artists and more than 6,500 pieces of original paintings, [[fine-art photography]], drawings and sculptures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fine art moves from gallery to the Web|url = http://www.mercurynews.com/business/ci_25032838/fine-art-moves-from-gallery-web|website = www.mercurynews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company counts clients in every U.S. state and over 45 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Stephen Tanenbaum, small business expert, on small business radio program, The Small Business Advocate Show|url = http://www.smallbusinessadvocate.com/small-business-experts/stephen-tanenbaum-101120|website = www.smallbusinessadvocate.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as 1.7&amp;nbsp;million social followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UGallery (ugallery)|url = https://www.pinterest.com/ugallery/|website = Pinterest|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UGallery.com|url = http://facebook.com/Ugallery|website = facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UGallery (@UGallery) {{!}} Twitter|url = https://twitter.com/UGallery|website = twitter.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UGallery (@ugallery) • Instagram photos and videos|url = http://instagram.com/ugallery/|website = instagram.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
UGallery was an early entrant to the business of selling original art online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Artist's Toolbox: 30+ Places to Promote Your Art|url = http://mashable.com/2007/09/18/artists-toolbox/|website = Mashable|accessdate = 2015-11-13|first = Patric Herber2007-09-19 02:37:17|last = UTC}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, many art critics questioned the concept. A 2007 [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]] article called "the online art marketplace as mottled as a [[Claude Monet|Monet]] water scene."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = A Work in Progress: Buying Art on the Web|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB119197772816454170|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|access-date = 2015-11-13|issn = 0099-9660|first = Kelly|last = Crow}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, the online art market was valued at $870&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hiscox Report: Online Art Trade 2013|url = http://www.arttactic.com/market-analysis/art-markets/us-a-european-art-market/559-hiscox-report-online-art-trade-2013.html?Itemid=102|website = www.arttactic.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the estimated value of the online art market grew to $2.64&amp;nbsp;billion, accounting for 4.8% of the estimated $55.2&amp;nbsp;billion value of the global art market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hiscox Online Art Trade Report 2015|url = http://www.arttactic.com/market-analysis/art-markets/us-a-european-art-market/699-hiscox-online-art-trade-report-2015.html?Itemid=102|website = www.arttactic.com|accessdate = 2015-11-13|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150905030328/http://www.arttactic.com/market-analysis/art-markets/us-a-european-art-market/699-hiscox-online-art-trade-report-2015.html?Itemid=102|archivedate = September 5, 2015|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recognition ==
In 2011, [[The Economist]] called UGallery "unintimidating enough to encourage a new generation of collectors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Clicking your way to an art collection|url = https://www.economist.com/blogs/prospero/2011/02/affordable_art|newspaper = The Economist|access-date = 2015-11-13|issn = 0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, [[VentureBeat]] wrote that UGallery's e-commerce platform is "democratizing the art world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UGallery hits growth milestones as art sales move online (exclusive)|url = https://venturebeat.com/2013/05/14/ugallery-hits-growth-milestones-as-art-sales-move-online-exclusive/|website = VentureBeat|accessdate = 2015-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Internet Retailer named UGallery to their Second 500 Guide,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Social media and unique products drive sales growth at UGallery|url = https://www.internetretailer.com/2013/06/04/social-media-and-unique-products-drive-sales-growth-ugallery|accessdate = 2015-11-13|first = Stefany|last = Zaroban}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2015, named UGallery the top luxury e-retailer for artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://images.internetretailer.com/IR/Collections/2015_LuxuryReport_IR.pdf|title = Luxury on the Web: Exclusive Rankings, Data and Analysis of the World’s Largest Luxury E-Retailers|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = Internet Retailer|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2041">The '''WGA script registration service''' is a service run by both the [[Writers Guild of America, East]] (WGAE) and the [[Writers Guild of America West]] (WGAW) to establish the date of creation of [[literary property]], typically a motion picture screenplay, useful in the often-contentious U.S. entertainment field. 

The service supports the [[WGA screenwriting credit system]] but is also available for non-members to use.  This is one of the distinctions that makes the WGAE and WGAw true [[guild]]s and not simply a [[trade union]] bargaining for existing members.

Registration with the Guilds has become important in [[lawsuit]]s for [[copyright infringement]] especially where the degree of copying is very loose or vague or conceptual:  invoking the Guilds itself as registrar indicates that the Guilds' standard concept of property rights in literary works were expected to be followed by at least the registrant.

Although registration is an important part of assisting in protecting a writer's rights to his or her work and determining compensation, registration is not the same as a US Copyright.  Although a registration may constitute evidence in a copyright dispute, registration is not proof of copyright registration or ownership. Additionally, an official Copyright registration with the U.S. Library of Congress is required to invoke the jurisdiction of U.S. Federal Courts, where most copyright infringement claims are adjudicated.
