'''Analog device''' is usually a combination of both analog [[machine]] and analog [[recording media|media]] that can together [[Measurement|measure]], [[Analog recording|record]], reproduce, or [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] [[continuum (measurement)|continuous]] [[information]], for example, the almost infinite number of grades of [[transparency (optics)|transparency]], [[voltage]], [[Electrical resistance|resistance]], [[rotation]], or [[pressure]]. In theory, the continuous information (also [[analog signal]]) has an infinite number of possible [[Value (mathematics)|value]]s with the only limitation on [[Angular resolution|resolution]] being the [[accuracy]] of the analog device.

==Examples==

===Non-electrical===
There are notable non-electrical analog devices, such as [[clock]]s (sundials, water clocks, pendulum clocks, analog watches), the astrolabe, slide rules, the governor of a steam engine, the [[planimeter]] (a simple device that measures the area of a closed shape), Kelvin's mechanical [[Tide-predicting machine|tide predictor]], acoustic rangefinders, servomechanisms (e.g. the thermostat), a simple mercury thermometer, a bathroom scale, and the speedometer 
===Electrical===
The [[telautograph]] is an analogue precursor to the modern fax machine. It transmits electrical impulses recorded by potentiometers to stepping motors attached to a pen, thus being able to reproduce a drawing or signature made by the sender at the receiver's station. It was the first such device to transmit drawings to a stationary sheet of paper; previous inventions in Europe used rotating drums to make such transmissions.

An [[analog synthesizer]] is a synthesizer that uses analog circuits and [[analog computer]] techniques to generate sound electronically.

The [[analog television]] encodes television and transports the picture and sound information as an analogue signal, that is, by varying the amplitude and/or frequencies of the broadcast signal. All systems preceding digital television, such as NTSC, PAL or UNIT are analog television systems.

An [[analog computer]] is a form of computer that uses electrical, mechanical or hydraulic phenomena to model the problem being solved. More generally an analog computer uses one kind of physical quantity to represent the behaviour of another physical system, or mathematical function. Modeling a real physical system in a computer is called simulation.

==Interfacing the digital and analog worlds==
In electronics, a [[digital-to-analog converter]] (DAC or D-to-A) is a circuit for converting a [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signal]] (usually binary) to an analog signal (current, voltage or electric charge). Digital-to-analog converters are interfaces between the digital world and analog world. An [[analog-to-digital converter]] (abbreviated ADC, A/D or A to D) is an electronic circuit that converts continuous signals to discrete digital numbers.

==Controversy over photographic film==
There is quite a bit of controversy in the photographic world as to whether or not a film camera should be considered an "analog device" since the photographic film isn't a truly analog recording medium and requires chemistry to process an image. "Analog" has become the common term for referring to cameras that are "not digital" and is an easy shorthand for people to differentiate between the two [[Medium (arts)|mediums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=The Goddamn Batman |url=http://fringefocus.com/2010/technical/analog-is-not-the-opposite-of-digital |title=Analog Is Not the Opposite of Digital – Fringe Focus |publisher=Fringefocus.com |date=2010-08-02 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625120830/http://fringefocus.com/2010/technical/analog-is-not-the-opposite-of-digital |archivedate=2013-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://photo-utopia.blogspot.com/2007/10/chumps-and-clumps.html |title=Photo Utopia: Clumps and Chumps (or why film isn't binary) |publisher=Photo-utopia.blogspot.com |date=2008-10-20 |accessdate=2016-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Antikythera mechanism''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|t|ᵻ|k|ᵻ|ˈ|θ|ɪər|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|t|ᵻ|ˈ|k|ɪ|θ|ər|ə}}) is an ancient Greek [[analogue computer]]&lt;ref name=amrp-07-1/&gt;&lt;ref name=seaman-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=swedinFerro2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=paphitis-06/&gt; and [[orrery]] used to predict [[astronomy|astronomical]] positions and [[eclipse]]s for [[calendar]] and [[Hellenistic astrology|astrological]] purposes decades in advance.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;&lt;ref name=pinotsis/&gt; It could also be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games which was similar to an [[Olympiad]], the cycle of the [[ancient Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Sarah (14 June 2016).

The device, housed in the remains of a {{cvt|34|×|18|×|9|cm|in|adj=on}} wooden box, was found as one lump, later separated into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation works. Four of these fragments contain gears, while inscriptions are found on many others.&lt;ref name=bibliotec/&gt;&lt;ref name=vetenskapens/&gt; The largest gear is approximately {{convert|14|cm|in}} in diameter and originally had 223 teeth.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt;

It is a complex [[clockwork]] mechanism composed of at least 30 meshing bronze gears. A team led by Mike Edmunds and Tony Freeth at [[Cardiff University]] used modern computer [[x-ray]] [[tomography]] and high resolution surface scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing of the machine.

Detailed imaging of the mechanism suggests that it had 37 gear wheels enabling it to follow the movements of the moon and the sun through the zodiac, to predict eclipses and even to model the [[Lunar month#Anomalistic month|irregular orbit of the moon]], where the moon’s velocity is higher in its [[Apsis|perigee than in its apogee]]. This motion was studied in the 2nd century BC by astronomer [[Hipparchus]] of [[Rhodes]], and it is speculated that he may have been consulted in the machine's construction.&lt;ref name=sample-06/&gt;

The knowledge of this technology was lost at some point in [[Late Antiquity|antiquity]], and technological works approaching its complexity and workmanship did not appear again until the development of mechanical [[astronomical clock]]s in Europe in the fourteenth century.&lt;ref name=marchant-06 /&gt; All known fragments of the Antikythera mechanism are kept at the [[National Archaeological Museum, Athens|National Archaeological Museum]] in Athens, along with a number of artistic reconstructions/replicas of how the mechanism may have looked and worked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/museum "The Antikythera Mechanism at the National Archaeological Museum"].

==History==
{{see also|Antikythera wreck}}

===Discovery===
[[File:DerekdeSollaPrice.jpg|thumb|[[Derek J. de Solla Price]] (1922–1983) with a model of the Antikythera mechanism]]
The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved from {{convert|45|m}} of water in the [[Antikythera wreck|Antikythera shipwreck]] off Point Glyphadia on the Greek island of [[Antikythera]] in 1901, most probably in July of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/history|title=History - Antikythera Mechanism Research Project|website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck had been found in April 1900 by a group of Greek [[Sponge diving|sponge divers]] who retrieved numerous large arte&lt;!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling --&gt;facts, including bronze and marble statues,  pottery, unique glassware, jewellery, coins, and the mechanism.  All were transferred to the National Museum of Archaeology in Athens for storage and analysis. The mechanism was merely a lump of corroded bronze and wood at the time and went unnoticed for two years, while museum staff worked on piecing together more obvious statues.&lt;ref name=marchant-06/&gt;

On 17 May 1902, [[archaeology|archaeologist]] [[Valerios Stais]] found that one of the pieces of rock had a gear wheel embedded in it. He initially believed that it was an astronomical clock, but most scholars considered the device to be [[wikt:prochronistic|prochronistic]], too complex to have been constructed during the same period as the other pieces that had been discovered. Investigations into the object were dropped until British science historian and Yale University professor [[Derek J. de Solla Price]] became interested in it in 1951.&lt;ref name=haughton2006/&gt; In 1971, Price and Greek nuclear physicist Charalampos Karakalos made X-ray and [[Gamma camera|gamma-ray images]] of the 82 fragments. Price published an extensive 70-page paper on their findings in 1974.&lt;ref name=marchant-06 /&gt;

It is not known how the mechanism came to be on the cargo ship, but it has been suggested that it was being taken from [[Rhodes]] to [[Rome]], together with other looted treasure, to support a [[Roman triumph|triumphal parade]] being staged by [[Julius Caesar]].&lt;ref name=iol/&gt;

Two other searches for items at the Antikythera wreck site in 2012 and 2015 have yielded a number of fascinating art objects and a second ship which may or may not be connected with the treasure ship on which the Mechanism was found.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title=Missing Piece of Antikythera Mechanism Found on Aegean Seabed| url=https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-missing-piece-of-antikythera-mechanism-found-on-aegean-seabed-1.6640779| publisher=Haaretz| date=16 November 2018| accessdate=15 November 2018&lt;!--yes, dates are correct--&gt;| first=Philippe| last=Bohstrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also found was a bronze disk, with the image of a bull embellished on it.  The disk has four "ears" which have holes in them, and it was thought by some that it may have been part of the Antikythera Mechanism itself, as a "[[gear|cog wheel]]".  However, there appears to be little evidence that it was part of the Mechanism; it is more likely that the disk was a bronze decoration on a piece of furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| publisher=Smithsonian Magazine| title=No, Archaeologists Probably Did Not Find a New Piece of the Antikythera Mechanism| url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/no-archaeologists-probably-did-not-find-new-piece-antikythera-mechanism-180970821/| first=Jason| last=Daley| date=15 November 2018|accessdate=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin===
The Antikythera mechanism is generally referred to as the first known [[analogue computer]].&lt;ref name=angelakis2006/&gt; The quality and complexity of the mechanism's manufacture suggests that it has undiscovered predecessors made during the [[Hellenistic period]].&lt;ref name=allen-07/&gt; Its construction relied on theories of astronomy and mathematics developed by Greek astronomers during the second century BC, and it is estimated to have been built in the late second century BC&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt; or the early first century BC&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars", ''Hesperia'' 86 (2017) 129–203.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 1974, Derek de Solla Price concluded from gear settings and inscriptions on the mechanism's faces that it was made about 87 BC and lost only a few years later.&lt;ref name=price-74/&gt; [[Jacques Cousteau]] and associates visited the wreck in 1976 and recovered coins dated between 76 and 67 BC.&lt;ref name=lazos-94/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antikythera-mechanism.gr/history/people/jacques-yves-cousteau|title=Jacques-Yves Cousteau – Antikythera Mechanism Research Project|website=www.antikythera-mechanism.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism's advanced state of corrosion has made it impossible to perform an accurate [[Metallurgical assay|compositional analysis]], but it is believed that the device was made of a low-tin [[bronze]] alloy (of approximately 95% copper, 5% tin).&lt;ref name=amrp-07/&gt; Its instructions were composed in [[Koine Greek]].&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

In 2008, continued research by the Antikythera Mechanism Research Project suggested that the concept for the mechanism may have originated in the colonies of [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]], since they identified the calendar on the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] Spiral as coming from Corinth or one of its colonies in Northwest Greece or Sicily.&lt;ref&gt;Freeth, Tony; Jones, Alexander; Steele, John M.; Bitsakis, Yanis (31 July 2008). "Calendars with Olympiad display and eclipse prediction on the Antikythera Mechanism"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] was a colony of Corinth and the home of [[Archimedes]], and the Antikythera Mechanism Research project argued in 2008 that it might imply a connection with the school of Archimedes.&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; However, it has recently been demonstrated that the calendar on the Metonic Spiral is indeed of the Corinthian type but cannot be that of Syracuse.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars", ''Hesperia'' 86 (2017): 134–141.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory suggests that coins found by Jacques Cousteau at the wreck site in the 1970s date to the time of the device's construction, and posits that its origin may have been from the ancient Greek city of [[Pergamon]],&lt;ref name="Freeth_SA" /&gt; home of the [[Library of Pergamum]]. With its many scrolls of art and science, it was second in importance only to the [[Library of Alexandria]] during the Hellenistic period.&lt;ref&gt;Article "Pergamum", ''Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia'', 6th Edition, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship carrying the device also contained vases in the [[Rhodes|Rhodian]] style, leading to a hypothesis that it was constructed at an academy founded by [[Stoicism|Stoic]] philosopher [[Posidonius]] on that Greek island.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Derek de Solla (1974). "Gears from the Greeks. The Antikythera Mechanism: A Calendar Computer from ca. 80 B.C.". Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, New Series. 64 (7): 13; 57–62.&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes was a busy trading port in antiquity and a centre of astronomy and mechanical engineering, home to astronomer [[Hipparchus]] who was active from about 140 BC to 120 BC. The mechanism uses Hipparchus's theory for the motion of the moon, which suggests the possibility that he may have designed it or at least worked on it.&lt;ref name=marchant-06/&gt; In addition, it has recently been argued that the astronomical events on the [[Parapegma]] of the Antikythera Mechanism work best for latitudes in the range of 33.3–37.0 degrees north;&lt;ref&gt;Yannis Bitsakis and Alexander Jones, "The Inscriptions of the Antikythera Mechanism 3: The Front Dial and Parapegma Inscriptions", ''Almagest'' 7 (2016), pp. 117–119. See also Magdalini Anastasiou et al., "The Astronomical Events of the Parapegma of the Antikythera Mechanism", ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'' 44 (2013): 173–186.&lt;/ref&gt; the island of Rhodes is located between the latitudes of 35.85 and 36.50 degrees north.

In 2014, a study by Carman and Evans argued for a new dating of approximately 200 BC based on identifying the start-up date on the [[Saros Dial]] as the astronomical lunar month that began shortly after the new moon of 28 April 205 BC.&lt;ref name="Carman Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20141124-JM"/&gt; Moreover, according to Carman and Evans, the Babylonian arithmetic style of prediction fits much better with the device's predictive models than the traditional Greek trigonometric style.&lt;ref name="Carman Evans" /&gt; A study by Paul Iversen published in 2017 reasons that the prototype for the device was indeed from Rhodes, but that this particular model was modified for a client from Epirus in northwestern Greece, and was probably constructed within a generation of the shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars", ''Hesperia'' 86 (2017) 129–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further dives were undertaken in 2014, with plans to continue in 2015, in the hope of discovering more of the mechanism.&lt;ref name=NYT-20141124-JM /&gt;

==Description==
The original mechanism apparently came out of the Mediterranean as a single encrusted piece. Soon afterward it fractured into three major pieces. Other small pieces have broken off in the interim from cleaning and handling,&lt;ref name=marchant-06-01&gt;{{cite book| first=Jo| last=Marchant| title=Decoding the Heavens| publisher=Da Capo Press| date=2006| page=180}} mechanical engineer and former curator of London's [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] [[Michael Wright (engineer)|Michael Wright]] tells of a piece breaking off in his inspection, which was glued back into place by the museum staff.&lt;/ref&gt; and still others were found on the sea floor by the Cousteau expedition. Other fragments may still be in storage, undiscovered since their initial recovery; Fragment F came to light in that way in 2005. Of the 82 known fragments, seven are mechanically significant and contain the majority of the mechanism and inscriptions. There are also 16 smaller parts that contain fractional and incomplete inscriptions.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=wright-07/&gt;

|- align=center
| A ||180&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;150 ||369.1 ||27 ||Yes
| style="text-align:left" | The main fragment contains the majority of the known mechanism. Clearly visible on the front is the large b1 gear, and under closer inspection further gears behind said gear (parts of the l, m, c, and d trains are clearly visible as gears to the naked eye). The crank mechanism socket and the side-mounted gear that meshes with b1 is on ''Fragment A''. The back of the fragment contains the rearmost e and k gears for synthesis of the moon anomaly, noticeable also is the pin and slot mechanism of the k train. It is noticed from detailed scans of the fragment that all gears are very closely packed and have sustained damage and displacement due to their years in the sea. The fragment is approximately 30&amp;nbsp;mm thick at its thickest point.

Fragment A also contains divisions of the upper left quarter of the Saros spiral and 14 inscriptions from said spiral. The fragment also contains inscriptions for the Exeligmos dial and visible on the back surface the remnants of the dial face. Finally, this fragment contains some back door inscriptions.
|- align=center
| B ||125&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;60 ||99.4 ||1 ||Yes
| style="text-align:left" |  Contains approximately the bottom right third of the Metonic spiral and inscriptions of both the spiral and back door of the mechanism. The Metonic scale would have consisted of 235 cells of which 49 have been deciphered from fragment B either in whole or partially. The rest so far are assumed from knowledge of the [[Metonic cycle]]. This fragment also contains a single gear (o1) used in the Olympic train.

===Minor fragments===
Many of the smaller fragments that have been found contain nothing of apparent value; however, a few have some inscriptions on them. Fragment 19 contains significant back door inscriptions including one reading "...&amp;nbsp;76 years&amp;nbsp;..." which refers to the [[Callippic cycle]]. Other inscriptions seem to describe the function of the back dials. In addition to this important minor fragment, 15 further minor fragments have remnants of inscriptions on them.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|7}}

==Mechanism==
[[Image:Antikythera mechanism.svg|thumb|right|Schematic of the arte&lt;!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling --&gt;fact's known mechanism]]

Information on the specific data gleaned from the ruins by the latest inquiries is detailed in the supplement to Freeth's 2006 ''Nature'' article.&lt;ref name="freeth-06" /&gt;

===Operation===
On the front face of the mechanism there is a fixed ring dial representing the [[ecliptic]], the twelve [[zodiac]]al signs marked off with equal 30 degree sectors. This matched with the Babylonian custom of assigning one twelfth of the ecliptic to each zodiac sign equally, even though the [[constellation]] boundaries were variable. Outside of that dial is another ring which is rotatable, marked off with the months and days of the Sothic [[Egyptian calendar]], twelve months of 30 days plus five [[Intercalation (timekeeping)|intercalary days]]. The months are marked with the Egyptian names for the months transcribed into the [[Greek alphabet]]. The first task, then, is to rotate the Egyptian calendar ring to match the current zodiac points. The Egyptian calendar ignored leap days, so it advanced through a full zodiac sign in about 120 years.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The mechanism was operated by turning a small hand crank (now lost) which was linked via a [[crown gear]] to the largest gear, the four-spoked gear visible on the front of fragment A, the gear named b1. This moved the date pointer on the front dial, which would be set to the correct Egyptian calendar day. The year is not selectable, so it is necessary to know the year currently set, or by looking up the cycles indicated by the various calendar cycle indicators on the back in the Babylonian [[ephemeris]] tables for the day of the year currently set, since most of the calendar cycles are not synchronous with the year. The crank moves the date pointer about 78 days per full rotation, so hitting a particular day on the dial would be easily possible if the mechanism were in good working condition. The action of turning the hand crank would also cause all interlocked gears within the mechanism to rotate, resulting in the simultaneous calculation of the position of the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], the [[Lunar phase|moon phase]], [[eclipse]], and calendar cycles, and perhaps the locations of [[List of gravitationally rounded objects of the Solar System#Planets|planets]].&lt;ref name=freeth-09/&gt;

The operator also had to be aware of the position of the spiral dial pointers on the two large dials on the back. The pointer had a "follower" that tracked the spiral incisions in the metal as the dials incorporated four and five full rotations of the pointers. When a pointer reached the terminal month location at either end of the spiral, the pointer's follower had to be manually moved to the other end of the spiral before proceeding further.&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Faces===
[[File:Computer graphic for front of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated front panel of the Freeth model]]

====Front face====
The front dial has two concentric circular scales that represent the path of the [[ecliptic]] through the heavens. The outer ring is marked off with the days of the 365-day [[Egyptian civil calendar]]. On the inner ring, a second dial marks the Greek signs of the [[Zodiac]], with division into degrees. The mechanism predates the [[Julian calendar]] reform, but the [[Sothic cycle|Sothic]] and [[Callippic cycle]]s had already pointed to a {{frac|365|1|4}}-day solar year, as seen in [[Ptolemy III]]'s [[Decree of Canopus|abortive calendrical reform]] of 238{{nbsp}}BC. The dials are not believed to reflect his proposed [[leap day]] ([[Egyptian intercalary month|Epag.]] 6), but the outer calendar dial may be moved against the inner dial to compensate for the effect of the extra quarter day in the solar year by turning the scale backward one day every four years.

The position of the sun on the ecliptic corresponds to the current date in the year. The orbits of the moon and the five planets known to the Greeks are close enough to the ecliptic to make it a convenient reference for defining their positions as well.

The following three [[Egyptian calendar#Months|Egyptian months]] are inscribed in [[History of the Greek alphabet|Greek letters]] on the surviving pieces of the outer ring:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Jones |first=Alexander |title=A Portable Cosmos |p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bl3ODQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT97 97] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bl3ODQAAQBAJ |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ΠΑΧΩΝ ([[Pachon]])
* ΠΑΥΝΙ ([[Payni]])
* ΕΠΙΦΙ ([[Epiphi]])

The other months have been reconstructed, although some reconstructions of the mechanism omit the 5 days of the Egyptian intercalary month. The [[Zodiac]] dial contains Greek inscriptions of the members of the zodiac, which is believed to be adapted to the [[tropical month]] version rather than the [[Sidereal month|sidereal]]:&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|8}}{{Failed verification|reason=This page mentions neither tropical nor sidereal|date=September 2016}}

Also on the zodiac dial are a number of single characters at specific points (see reconstruction here:&lt;ref name="isaw-1"/&gt;). They are keyed to a ''[[parapegma]]'', a precursor of the modern day [[almanac]] inscribed on the front face above and beneath the dials. They mark the locations of longitudes on the ecliptic for specific stars. The ''parapegma'' above the dials reads (square brackets indicate inferred text):

At least two pointers indicated positions of bodies upon the ecliptic. A lunar pointer indicated the position of the moon, and a mean sun pointer also was shown, perhaps doubling as the current date pointer. The moon position was not a simple mean moon indicator that would indicate movement uniformly around a circular orbit; it approximated the acceleration and deceleration of the moon's elliptical orbit, through the earliest extant use of [[epicyclic gearing]].

It also tracked the precession of the elliptical orbit around the ecliptic in an 8.88 year cycle. The mean sun position is, by definition, the current date. It is speculated that since such pains were taken to get the position of the moon correct,&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|20, 24}} then there also was likely to have been a "true sun" pointer in addition to the mean sun pointer likewise, to track the elliptical anomaly of the sun (the orbit of Earth around the sun), but there is no evidence of it among the ruins of the mechanism found to date.&lt;ref name=freeth-12 /&gt; Similarly, neither is there the evidence of planetary orbit pointers for the five planets known to the Greeks among the ruins. See [[#Proposed planet indication gearing schemes|Proposed planet indication gearing schemes]] below.

Finally, mechanical engineer Michael Wright has demonstrated that there was a mechanism to supply the lunar phase in addition to the position.&lt;ref name=wright-05 /&gt; The indicator was a small ball embedded in the lunar pointer, half-white and half-black, which rotated to show the phase (new, first quarter, half, third quarter, full, and back) graphically. The data to support this function is available given the sun and moon positions as angular rotations; essentially, it is the angle between the two, translated into the rotation of the ball. It requires a [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gear]], a gearing arrangement that sums or differences two angular inputs.

====Rear face====
[[File:Computer graphic for back of Antikythera mechanism.jpg|thumb|right|Computer-generated back panel]]
In July 2008, scientists reported new findings in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' showing that the mechanism not only tracked the [[Metonic calendar]] and predicted [[solar eclipses]], but also calculated the timing of several panhellenic athletic games, including the [[Ancient Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; Inscriptions on the instrument closely match the names of the months that are used on calendars from [[Epirus]] in northwestern Greece and with the island of [[Corfu]], which in antiquity was known as Corcyra.&lt;ref name=wilford-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=connor-08/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148-168.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the back of the mechanism, there are five dials: the two large displays, the [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] and the [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]], and three smaller indicators, the so-called Olympiad Dial,&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; which has recently been renamed the Games dial as it did not track Olympiad years (the four-year cycle it tracks most closely is the Halieiad),&lt;ref name="Paul Iversen 2017"/&gt; the [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]], and the [[Exeligmos]].&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|11}}

The Metonic Dial is the main upper dial on the rear of the mechanism. The Metonic cycle, defined in several physical units, is 235 [[month#Synodic month|synodic months]], which is very close (to within less than 13 one-millionths) to 19 tropical years. It is therefore a convenient interval over which to convert between lunar and solar calendars. The Metonic dial covers 235 months in 5 rotations of the dial, following a spiral track with a follower on the pointer that keeps track of the layer of the spiral. The pointer points to the synodic month, counted from new moon to new moon, and the cell contains the [[Hellenic calendars#Corinthian|Corinthian month names]].&lt;ref name=freeth-08 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freeth | first1 = T | year = 2009 | title = Decoding an Ancient Computer | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 301 | issue = 6| pages = 76–83 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1209-76 | pmid=20058643|bibcode = 2009SciAm.301f..76F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 148-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, setting the correct solar time (in days) on the front panel indicates the current lunar month on the back panel, with resolution to within a week or so.

Based on the fact that the calendar month names are consistent with all the evidence of the Epirote calendar and that the Games dial mentions the very minor Naa games of Dodona (in Epirus), it has recently been argued that the calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism is likely to be the Epirote calendar, and that this calendar was probably adopted from a Corinthian colony in Epirus, possibly Ambracia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It has also been argued that the first month of the calendar, Phoinikaios, was ideally the month in which the autumn equinox fell, and that the start-up date of the calendar began shortly after the astronomical new moon of 23 August 205 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 165-185.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Callippic dial is the left secondary upper dial, which follows a 76-year cycle. The [[Callippic cycle]] is four Metonic cycles, and so this dial indicates the current Metonic cycle in the overall Callippic cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

The Games dial is the right secondary upper dial; it is the only pointer on the instrument that travels in a counter-clockwise direction as time advances. The dial is divided into four sectors, each of which is inscribed with a year indicator and the name of two [[Panhellenic Games]]: the "crown" games of [[Isthmian Games|Isthmia]], [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympia]], [[Nemean Games|Nemea]], and [[Pythian Games|Pythia]]; and two lesser games: Naa (held at [[Dodona]]),&lt;ref name=bbc-08/&gt; and the sixth and final set of Games recently deciphered as the Halieia of Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Iversen, "The Calendar on the Antikythera Mechanism and the Corinthian Family of Calendars, Hesperia 86 (2017): 141-147.&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions on each one of the four divisions are:&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;

The Saros dial is the main lower spiral dial on the rear of the mechanism.&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|4–5, 10}} The [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] cycle is 18 years and {{frac|11|1|3}} days long (6585.333… days), which is very close to 223 synodic months (6585.3211 days). It is defined as the cycle of repetition of the positions required to cause solar and lunar eclipses, and therefore, it could be used to predict them&amp;nbsp;— not only the month, but the day and time of day. Note that the cycle is approximately 8 hours longer than an integer number of days. Translated into global spin, that means an eclipse occurs not only eight hours later, but one-third of a rotation farther to the west. Glyphs in 51 of the 223 synodic month cells of the dial specify the occurrence of 38 lunar and 27 solar eclipses. Some of the abbreviations in the glyphs read:
* Σ = ΣΕΛΗΝΗ (Moon)
* Η = ΗΛΙΟΣ (Sun)
* H\M = ΗΜΕΡΑΣ (of the day)
* ω\ρ = ωρα (hour)
* N\Y = ΝΥΚΤΟΣ (of the night)

The glyphs show whether the designated eclipse is solar or lunar, and give the day of the month and hour; obviously, solar eclipses may not be visible at any given point, and lunar eclipses are visible only if the moon is above the horizon at the appointed hour.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|6}} In addition, the inner lines at the cardinal points of the Saros dial indicate the start of a new [[full moon cycle]]. Based on the distribution of the times of the eclipses, it has recently been argued that the start-up date of the Saros dial was shortly after the astronomical new moon of 28 April 205 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Carman, Christián C.; Evans, James (15 November 2014). "On the epoch of the Antikythera mechanism and its eclipse predictor". Archive for History of Exact Sciences. 68 (6): 693–774.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Exeligmos Dial is the secondary lower dial on the rear of the mechanism. The [[Exeligmos]] cycle is a 54-year triple Saros cycle that is 19,756 days long. Since the length of the Saros cycle is to a third of a day (eight hours), so a full Exeligmos cycle returns counting to integer days, hence the inscriptions. The labels on its three divisions are:&lt;ref name=freeth-06 /&gt;{{rp|10}}
* Blank or o ? (representing the number zero, assumed, not yet observed)
* H (number 8) means add 8 hours to the time mentioned in the display
* Iϛ (number 16) means add 16 hours to the time mentioned in the display

Thus the dial pointer indicates how many hours must be added to the glyph times of the Saros dial in order to calculate the exact eclipse times.

===Doors===
The mechanism has a wooden casing with a front and a back door, both containing inscriptions.&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt; The back door appears to be the "instruction manual". On one of its fragments is written "76 years, 19 years" representing the [[Callippic]] and [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] cycles. Also written is "223" for the Saros cycle. On another one of its fragments, it is written "on the spiral subdivisions 235" referring to the Metonic dial.

===Gearing===
The mechanism is remarkable for the level of miniaturisation and the complexity of its parts, which is comparable to that of fourteenth-century astronomical clocks. It has at least 30 gears, although mechanism expert Michael Wright has suggested that the Greeks of this period were capable of implementing a system with many more gears.&lt;ref name=freeth-09/&gt;

There is much debate as to whether the mechanism had indicators for all five of the planets known to the ancient Greeks. No gearing for such a planetary display survives and all gears are accounted for—with the exception of one 63-toothed gear (r1) otherwise unaccounted for in fragment D.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The purpose of the front face was to position astronomical bodies with respect to the [[celestial sphere]] along the [[ecliptic]], in reference to the observer's position on the Earth. That is irrelevant to the question of whether that position was computed using a heliocentric or geocentric view of the solar system; either computational method should, and does, result in the same position (ignoring ellipticity), within the error factors of the mechanism.

Ptolemy's epicyclic solar system (still 300 years in the future from the apparent date of the mechanism), carried forward with more epicycles, was more accurate predicting the positions of planets than the view of Copernicus, until Kepler introduced the possibility that orbits are ellipses.&lt;ref name=amrp-07-2/&gt;

Evans et al. suggest that to display the mean positions of the five [[classical planets]] would require only 17 further gears that could be positioned in front of the large driving gear and indicated using individual circular dials on the face.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt;

Tony Freeth and Alexander Jones have modelled and published details of a version using several gear trains mechanically-similar to the lunar anomaly system allowing for indication of the positions of the planets as well as synthesis of the sun anomaly. Their system, they claim, is more authentic than Wright's model as it uses the known skill sets of the Greeks of that period and does not add excessive complexity or internal stresses to the machine.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The gear teeth were in the form of [[equilateral triangle]]s with an average circular pitch of 1.6&amp;nbsp;mm, an average wheel thickness of 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm and an average air gap between gears of 1.2&amp;nbsp;mm. The teeth probably were created from a blank bronze round using hand tools; this is evident because not all of them are even.&lt;ref name="freeth-12"/&gt; Due to advances in imaging and [[X-ray computed tomography|X-ray]] technology it is now possible to know the precise number of teeth and size of the gears within the located fragments. Thus the basic operation of the device is no longer a mystery and has been replicated accurately. The major unknown remains the question of the presence and nature of any planet indicators.&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1 /&gt;{{rp|8}}

A table of the gears, their teeth, and the expected and computed rotations of various important gears follows. The gear functions come from Freeth et al. (2008)&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt; and those for the lower half of the table from Freeth and Jones 2012.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; The computed values start with 1 year/revolution for the b1 gear, and the remainder are computed directly from gear teeth ratios. The gears marked with an asterisk (*) are missing, or have predecessors missing, from the known mechanism; these gears have been calculated with reasonable gear teeth counts.&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt;

There are several gear ratios for each planet that result in close matches to the correct values for synodic periods of the planets and the sun. The ones chosen above seem to provide good accuracy with reasonable tooth counts, but the specific gears that may have been used are, and probably will remain, unknown.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

====Known gear scheme====
[[File:AntikytheraMechanismSchematic-Freeth12.png|thumb|left|upright=3|A hypothetical schematic representation of the gearing of the Antikythera Mechanism, including the 2012 published interpretation of existing gearing, gearing added to complete known functions, and proposed gearing to accomplish additional functions, namely true sun pointer and pointers for the five then-known planets, as proposed by Freeth and Jones, 2012.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; Based also upon similar drawing in the Freeth 2006 Supplement&lt;ref name=freeth-06-1/&gt; and Wright 2005, Epicycles Part 2.&lt;ref name=wright-05-1&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wright| first=Michael T.| date=June 2005| title=The Antikythera Mechanism: a new gearing scheme| journal=Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society| volume=85| pages=2–7 |url=http://fsoso.online.fr/antikythera/DOCS/Bulletin%20SIS%20June%202005%20New%20Gearing%20Scheme.pdf |access-date=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed (as opposed to known from the arte&lt;!-- 'e' - this article uses British spelling --&gt;fact) gearing crosshatched.]]
{{Clear}}
It is very probable that there were planetary dials, as the complicated motions and periodicities of all planets are mentioned in the manual of the mechanism. The exact position and mechanisms for the gears of the planets is not known. There is no coaxial system but only for the moon. Fragment D that is an epicycloidal system is considered as a planetary gear for Jupiter (Moussas, 2011, 2012, 2014) or a gear for the motion of the Sun (University of Thessaloniki group).
'''The Sun gear''' is operated from the hand-operated crank (connected to gear a1, driving the large four-spoked mean sun gear, b1) and in turn drives the rest of the gear sets. The sun gear is b1/b2 and b2 has 64 teeth. It directly drives the date/mean sun pointer (there may have been a second, "true sun" pointer that displayed the sun's elliptical anomaly; it is discussed below in the Freeth reconstruction). In this discussion, reference is to modelled rotational period of various pointers and indicators; they all assume the input rotation of the b1 gear of 360 degrees, corresponding with one tropical year, and are computed solely on the basis of the gear ratios of the gears named.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The Moon train''' starts with gear b1 and proceeds through c1, c2, d1, d2, e2, e5, k1, k2, e6, e1, and b3 to the moon pointer on the front face. The gears k1 and k2 form an [[epicyclic gearing|epicyclic gear system]]; they are an identical pair of gears that don't mesh, but rather, they operate face-to-face, with a short pin on k1 inserted into a slot in k2. The two gears have different centres of rotation, so the pin must move back and forth in the slot. That increases and decreases the radius at which k2 is driven, also necessarily varying its angular velocity (presuming the velocity of k1 is even) faster in some parts of the rotation than others.  Over an entire revolution the average velocities are the same, but the fast-slow variation models the effects of the elliptical orbit of the moon, in consequence of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Position as a function of time|Kepler's second and third laws]]. The modelled rotational period of the moon pointer (averaged over a year) is 27.321 days, compared to the modern length of a lunar sidereal month of 27.321661 days. As mentioned, the pin/slot driving of the k1/k2 gears varies the displacement over a year's time, and the mounting of those two gears on the e3 gear supplies a precessional advancement to the ellipticity modelling with a period of 8.8826 years, compared with the current value of precession period of the [[moon]] of 8.85 years.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

The system also models the [[lunar phase|phases of the moon]]. The moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the sun pointer at B0 (the connection between B0 and the rest of B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean sun pointer or a hypothetical true sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the moon, but is also geared to the sun&amp;nbsp;— the effect is to perform a [[differential gear]] operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the sun and moon pointers.  The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Metonic cycle|Metonic]] train''' is driven by the drive train b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, and n1, which is connected to the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the pointer is the length of the 6939.5 days (over the whole five-rotation spiral), while the modern value for the Metonic cycle is 6939.69 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Olympiad]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n2, and o1, which mounts the pointer.  It has a computed modelled rotational period of exactly 4 years, as expected. Incidentally, it is the only pointer on the mechanism that rotates counter-clockwise; all of the others rotate clockwise.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Callippic cycle|Callippic]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m2, n1, n3, p1, p2, and q1, which mounts the pointer. It has a computed modelled rotational period of 27758 days, while the modern value is 27758.8 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Saros (astronomy)|Saros]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, and g1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Saros pointer is 1646.3 days (in four rotations along the spiral pointer track); the modern value is 1646.33 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

'''The [[Exeligmos]] train''' is driven by b1, b2, l1, l2, m1, m3, e3, e4, f1, f2, g1, g2, h1, h2, and i1, which mounts the pointer. The modelled rotational period of the Exeligmos pointer is 19,756 days; the modern value is 19755.96 days.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

Apparently, gears m3, n1-3, p1-2, and q1 did not survive in the wreckage. The functions of the pointers were deduced from the remains of the dials on the back face, and reasonable, appropriate gearage to fulfill the functions was proposed, and is generally accepted.&lt;ref name=freeth-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=freeth-08/&gt;&lt;ref name=ieeecomp1/&gt;

====Proposed gear schemes====
Because of the large space between the mean sun gear and the front of the case and the size of and mechanical features on the mean sun gear it is very likely that the mechanism contained further gearing that either has been lost in or subsequent to the shipwreck or was removed before being loaded onto the ship.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; This lack of evidence and nature of the front part of the mechanism has led to numerous attempts to emulate what the Greeks of the period would have done and, of course, because of the lack of evidence many solutions have been put forward.

{{multiple image| direction = vertical| width = 150| image1 = Antikythera-proposed-4.svg| caption1  = Wright proposal| image2 = Antikythera-proposed-1.svg| caption2 = Evans et al. proposal| image3 = Antikythera-proposed-3.svg| caption3 = Freeth et al. proposal}}

'''Michael Wright''' was the first person to design and build a model with not only the known mechanism, but also, with his emulation of a potential [[planetarium]] system. He suggested that along with the lunar anomaly, adjustments would have been made for the deeper, more basic solar anomaly (known as the "first anomaly"). He included pointers for this "true sun", Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, in addition to the known "mean sun" (current time) and lunar pointers.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

'''Evans, Carman, and Thorndike''' published a solution with significant differences from Wright's.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt; Their proposal centred on what they observed as irregular spacing of the inscriptions on the front dial face, which to them seemed to indicate an off-centre sun indicator arrangement; this would simplify the mechanism by removing the need to simulate the solar anomaly. They also suggested that rather than accurate planetary indication (rendered impossible by the offset inscriptions) there would be simple dials for each individual planet showing information such as key events in the cycle of planet, initial and final appearances in the night sky, and apparent direction changes. This system would lead to a much simplified gear system, with much reduced forces and complexity, as compared to Wright's model.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt;

Their proposal used simple meshed gear trains and accounted for the previously unexplained 63 toothed gear in fragment D. They proposed two face plate layouts, one with evenly spaced dials, and another with a gap in the top of the face to account for criticism regarding their not using the apparent fixtures on the b1 gear. They proposed that rather than bearings and pillars for gears and axles, they simply held weather and seasonal icons to be displayed through a window.&lt;ref name=cte-10/&gt;

In a paper published in 2012 Carman, Thorndike, and Evans also proposed a system of epicyclic gearing with pin and slot followers.&lt;ref name=cte-12/&gt;

'''Freeth and Jones''' published their proposal in 2012 after extensive research and work. They came up with a compact and feasible solution to the question of planetary indication. They also propose indicating the solar anomaly (that is, the sun's apparent position in the zodiac dial) on a separate pointer from the date pointer, which indicates the mean position of the sun, as well as the date on the month dial. If the two dials are synchronised correctly, their front panel display is essentially the same as Wright's. Unlike Wright's model however, this model has not been built physically, and is only a 3-D computer model.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

[[Image:Gearing Relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism.svg|thumb|upright|Internal gearing relationships of the Antikythera Mechanism, based on the Freeth and Jones proposal]]

The system to synthesise the solar anomaly is very similar to that used in Wright's proposal. Three gears, one fixed in the centre of the b1 gear and attached to the sun spindle, the second fixed on one of the spokes (in their proposal the one on the bottom left) acting as an idle gear, and the final positioned next to that one, the final gear is fitted with an offset pin and, over said pin, an arm with a slot that in turn, is attached to the sun spindle, inducing anomaly as the mean sun wheel turns.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The inferior planet mechanism includes the sun (treated as a planet in this context), Mercury, and Venus.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; For each of the three systems there is an epicyclic gear whose axis is mounted on b1, thus the basic frequency is the Earth year (as it is, in truth, for epicyclic motion in the sun and all the planets—excepting only the moon). Each meshes with a gear grounded to the mechanism frame. Each has a pin mounted, potentially on an extension of one side of the gear that enlarges the gear, but doesn't interfere with the teeth; in some cases the needed distance between the gear's centre and the pin is farther than the radius of the gear itself. A bar with a slot along its length extends from the pin toward the appropriate coaxial tube, at whose other end is the object pointer, out in front of the front dials. The bars could have been full gears, although there is no need for the waste of metal, since the only working part is the slot. Also, using the bars avoids interference between the three mechanisms, each of which are set on one of the four spokes of b1. Thus there is one new grounded gear (one was identified in the wreckage, and the second is shared by two of the planets), one gear used to reverse the direction of the sun anomaly, three epicyclic gears and three bars/coaxial tubes/pointers, which would qualify as another gear each. Five gears and three slotted bars in all.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

The superior planet systems—Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn—all follow the same general principle of the lunar anomaly mechanism.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt; Similar to the inferior systems, each has a gear whose centre pivot is on an extension of b1, and which meshes with a grounded gear. It presents a pin and a centre pivot for the epicyclic gear which has a slot for the pin, and which meshes with a gear fixed to a coaxial tube and thence to the pointer. Each of the three mechanisms can fit within a quadrant of the b1 extension, and they are thus all on a single plane parallel with the front dial plate. Each one uses a ground gear, a driving gear, a driven gear, and a gear/coaxial tube/pointer, thus, twelve gears additional in all.

In total, there are eight coaxial spindles of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, 7 gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for a grand total of 54 gears, three bars, and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;

On the visual representation Freeth supplies in the paper, the pointers on the front zodiac dial have small, round identifying stones. He mentions a quote from an ancient papyrus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...a voice comes to you speaking. Let the stars be set upon the board in accordance with [their] nature except for the Sun and Moon. And let the Sun be golden, the Moon silver, Kronos [Saturn] of obsidian, Ares [Mars] of reddish onyx, Aphrodite [Venus] lapis lazuli veined with gold, Hermes [Mercury] turquoise; let Zeus [Jupiter] be of (whitish?) stone, crystalline (?)...&lt;ref name=papyrus/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Accuracy===
Investigations by Freeth and Jones reveal that their simulated mechanism is not particularly accurate, the Mars pointer being up to 38° off at times. This is not due to inaccuracies in gearing ratios in the mechanism, but rather to inadequacies in the Greek theory. The accuracy could not have been improved until first Ptolemy put forth his [[Almagest|Planetary Hypotheses]] in the second half of the second century AD and then the introduction of [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Second law|Kepler's Second Law]] in the early 17th century.&lt;ref name=freeth-12 /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In short, the Antikythera Mechanism was a machine designed to predict celestial phenomena according to the sophisticated astronomical theories current in its day, the sole witness to a lost history of brilliant engineering, a conception of pure genius, one of the great wonders of the ancient world—but it didn’t really work very well!&lt;ref name=freeth-12 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition to theoretical accuracy, there is the matter of mechanical accuracy. Freeth and Jones note that the inevitable "looseness" in the mechanism due to the hand-built gears, with their triangular teeth and the frictions between gears, and in bearing surfaces, probably would have swamped the finer solar and lunar correction mechanisms built into it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though the engineering was remarkable for its era, recent research indicates that its design conception exceeded the engineering precision of its manufacture by a wide margin—with considerable cumulative inaccuracies in the gear trains, which would have cancelled out many of the subtle anomalies built into its design.&lt;ref name=freeth-12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orca.cf.ac.uk/46026/|title=An Initial Assessment of the Accuracy of the Gear Trains in the Antikythera Mechanism|last=Geoffrey|first=Edmunds, Michael|date=1 August 2011|website=orca.cf.ac.uk|access-date=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the device itself may have struggled with inaccuracies due to the triangular teeth being hand made, the calculations used and the technology implemented to create the elliptical paths of the planets and retrograde motion of the moon and Mars by using a clockwork-type gear train with the addition of a pin-and-slot mechanism predated that of the first known clocks found in [[Late antiquity|antiquity]] in Medieval Europe by more than 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marchant|first1=Jo|title=Decoding the Heavens|date=2009|publisher=First Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81742-7|pages=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archimedes' development of the approximate value of pi and his theory of centres of gravity along with the steps he made towards developing the calculus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Netz &amp; Noel|first1=Reviel &amp; William|title=The Archimedes Codex|date=2007|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=978-0-306-81580-5|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; all suggest that the Greeks had access to more than enough mathematical knowledge beyond that of just Babylonian algebra in order to be able to model the elliptical nature of planetary motion.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Of special delight to physicists, the Moon mechanism uses a special train of bronze gears, two of them linked with a slightly offset axis, to indicate the position and phase of the moon. As is known today from [[Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion]], the moon travels at different speeds as it orbits the Earth, and this speed differential is modeled by the Antikythera Mechanism, even though the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] were not aware of the actual elliptical shape of the orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pickover|first1=Clifford|title=The Physics Book|date=2011|publisher=Sterling|isbn=978-1-4027-7861-2|pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Similar devices in ancient literature==

[[Cicero]]'s ''[[De re publica]]'', a 1st-century BC philosophical dialogue, mentions two machines that some modern authors consider as some kind of [[planetarium]] or [[orrery]], predicting the movements of the [[Sun]], the [[Moon]], and the five planets known at that time. They were both built by [[Archimedes]] and brought to Rome by the Roman general [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus]] after the death of Archimedes at the [[Siege of Syracuse (214–212 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in 212 BC. Marcellus had great respect for Archimedes and one of these machines was the only item he kept from the siege (the second was offered to the temple of Virtus). The device was kept as a family heirloom, and Cicero has Philus (one of the participants in a conversation that Cicero imagined had taken place in a villa belonging to [[Scipio Aemilianus]] in the year 129 BC) saying that [[Gaius Sulpicius Gallus]] (consul with [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (consul 166 BC)|Marcellus's nephew]] in 166 BC, and credited by [[Pliny the Elder]] as the first Roman to have written a book explaining solar and lunar eclipses) gave both a "learned explanation" and a working demonstration of the device.

{{quote|I had often heard this celestial globe or sphere mentioned on account of the great fame of Archimedes. Its appearance, however, did not seem to me particularly striking. There is another, more elegant in form, and more generally known, moulded by the same Archimedes, and deposited by the same Marcellus, in the Temple of Virtue at Rome. But as soon as Gallus had begun to explain, by his sublime science, the composition of this machine, I felt that the Sicilian geometrician must have possessed a genius superior to any thing we usually conceive to belong to our nature. Gallus assured us, that the solid and compact globe, was a very ancient invention, and that the first model of it had been presented by [[Thales of Miletus]]. That afterwards [[Eudoxus of Cnidus]], a disciple of [[Plato]], had traced on its surface the stars that appear in the sky, and that many years subsequent, borrowing from Eudoxus this beautiful design and representation, Aratus had illustrated them in his verses, not by any science of astronomy, but the ornament of poetic description. He added, that the figure of the sphere, which displayed the motions of the Sun and Moon, and the five planets, or wandering stars, could not be represented by the primitive solid globe. And that in this, the invention of Archimedes was admirable, because he had calculated how a single revolution should maintain unequal and diversified progressions in dissimilar motions.

When Gallus moved this globe it showed the relationship of the Moon with the Sun, and there were exactly the same number of turns on the bronze device as the number of days in the real globe of the sky. Thus it showed the same eclipse of the Sun as in the globe [of the sky], as well as showing the Moon entering the area of the Earth's shadow when the Sun is in line&amp;nbsp;... [missing text] [i.e. It showed both solar and lunar eclipses.]&lt;ref name=cicero/&gt;}}

[[Pappus of Alexandria]] stated that Archimedes had written a now lost manuscript on the construction of these devices entitled ''On Sphere-Making''.&lt;ref name=rorres-11/&gt;&lt;ref name=fildes-10/&gt; The surviving texts from the [[Library of Alexandria]] describe many of his creations, some even containing simple drawings. One such device is his [[odometer]], the exact model later used by the Romans to place their [[mile marker]]s (described by [[Vitruvius]], [[Heron of Alexandria]] and in the time of Emperor [[Commodus]]).&lt;ref name=needham/&gt; The drawings in the text appeared functional, but attempts to build them as pictured had failed. When the gears pictured, which had square teeth, were replaced with gears of the type in the Antikythera mechanism, which were angled, the device was perfectly functional.&lt;ref name=sleeswyk-81/&gt; Whether this is an example of a device created by Archimedes and described by texts lost in the burning of the [[Library of Alexandria]], or if it is a device based on his discoveries, or if it has anything to do with him at all, is debatable.

If Cicero's account is correct, then this technology existed as early as the 3rd century BC. Archimedes' device is also mentioned by later Roman era writers such as [[Lactantius]] (''Divinarum Institutionum Libri VII''), [[Claudian]] (''In sphaeram Archimedes''), and [[Proclus]] (''Commentary on the first book of Euclid's Elements of Geometry'') in the 4th and 5th centuries.

Cicero also said that another such device was built "recently" by his friend [[Posidonius]], "... each one of the revolutions of which brings about the same movement in the Sun and Moon and five wandering stars [planets] as is brought about each day and night in the heavens&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=cicero-1/&gt;

It is unlikely that any one of these machines was the Antikythera mechanism found in the shipwreck since both the devices fabricated by Archimedes and mentioned by Cicero were located in Rome at least 30 years later than the estimated date of the shipwreck, and the third device was almost certainly in the hands of Posidonius by that date. The scientists who have reconstructed the Antikythera mechanism also agree that it was too sophisticated to have been a unique device.

This evidence that the Antikythera mechanism was not unique adds support to the idea that there was an ancient Greek tradition of complex mechanical technology that was later, at least in part, transmitted to the Byzantine and [[Islamic Golden Age|Islamic world]]s, where mechanical devices which were complex, albeit simpler than the Antikythera mechanism, were built during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref name=charette-06/&gt; Fragments of a geared calendar attached to a sundial, from the 5th or 6th century [[Byzantine Empire]], have been found; the calendar may have been used to assist in telling time.&lt;ref name=madison-85/&gt; In the Islamic world, [[Banū Mūsā]]'s ''[[Book of Ingenious Devices|Kitab al-Hiyal]]'', or ''Book of Ingenious Devices'', was commissioned by the [[Caliph of Baghdad]] in the early 9th century AD. This text described over a hundred mechanical devices, some of which may date back to ancient Greek texts preserved in [[Monastery|monasteries]]. A geared calendar similar to the Byzantine device was described by the scientist [[al-Biruni]] around 1000, and a surviving 13th-century [[astrolabe]] also contains a similar clockwork device.&lt;ref name=madison-85/&gt; It is possible that this medieval technology may have been transmitted to Europe and contributed to the development of mechanical clocks there.&lt;ref name=marchant-06/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4242">[[File:Agaricus bisporus spores SEM 1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''[[Agaricus bisporus]]'' basidiospores]]
A '''basidiospore''' is a reproductive [[spore]] produced by [[Basidiomycete]] [[fungi]], a grouping that includes [[mushroom]]s, [[shelf fungus|shelf fungi]], [[rust fungus|rusts]], and [[smut (fungus)|smut]]s. Basidiospores typically each contain one [[haploid]] [[nucleus (biology)|nucleus]] that is the product of [[meiosis]], and they are produced by specialized fungal cells called [[basidium|basidia]]. Typically, four basidiospores develop on appendages from each basidium , out of these 2 are of one [[Strain (biology)|strain]] and other 2 of its opposite strain. In gills under a cap of one common species, there exist millions of basidia.  Some gilled mushrooms in the order [[Agaricales]] have the ability to release billions of spores.&lt;ref name="Halbwachs 2015" /&gt; The [[puffball]] fungus ''[[Calvatia gigantea]]'' has been calculated to produce about five trillion basidiospores.&lt;ref name="Li 2011" /&gt; Most basidiospores are forcibly discharged, and are thus considered ballistospores.&lt;ref name="Watkinson 2015" /&gt; These spores serve as the main air dispersal units for the fungi. The spores are released during periods of high humidity and generally have a night-time or pre-dawn peak concentration in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Halbwachs 2015" /&gt;

When basidiospores encounter a favorable substrate, they may [[germination|germinate]], typically by forming [[hyphae]]. These hyphae grow outward from the original spore, forming an expanding circle of [[mycelium]]. The circular shape of a fungal colony explains the formation of [[fairy ring]]s, and also the circular lesions of skin-infecting fungi that cause [[ringworm]]. Some basidiospores germinate repetitively by forming small spores instead of hyphae.

==General structure and shape==
Basidiospores are generally characterized by an attachment peg (called a [[hilum (biology)|hilar appendage]]) on its surface. This is where the spore was attached to the basidium. The hilar appendage is quite prominent in some basidiospores, but less evident in others. An apical [[germ pore]] may also be present. Many basidiospores have an asymmetric shape due to their development on the basidium.&lt;ref name="Watkinson 2015"/&gt; Basidiospores are typically single-celled (without [[septum|septa]]), and typically range from spherical to oval to oblong, to ellipsoid or cylindrical. The surface of the spore can be fairly smooth, or it can be ornamented.&lt;ref name="Halbwachs 2015"/&gt; The color of the [[spore print]] is usually found in the [[cell wall|spore wall]], although in rare instances – like the yellow spores of ''[[Clavaria helicoides]]'' – the [[cytoplasm]] is responsible for the spore color.&lt;ref name="Donk 1963"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55855">'''Cell-penetrating peptides''' ('''CPPs''') are short [[peptides]] that facilitate cellular intake/uptake of various molecular equipment (from nanosize particles to small chemical molecules and large fragments of DNA). The "cargo" is associated with the peptides either through chemical linkage via [[covalent bonds]] or through [[non-covalent interactions]]. The function of the CPPs are to deliver the cargo into cells, a process that commonly occurs through [[endocytosis]] with the cargo delivered to delivery vectors for use in research and medicine. Current use is limited by a lack of cell specificity in CPP-mediated cargo delivery and insufficient understanding of the modes of their uptake, that is why other delivery mechanisms have been developed like [[CellSqueeze]] and [[electroporation]].

CPPs typically have an [[amino acid]] composition that either contains a high relative abundance of positively charged amino acids such as [[lysine]] or [[arginine]] or has sequences that contain an alternating pattern of [[Chemical polarity|polar]]/charged amino acids and [[non-polar]], [[hydrophobic]] amino acids. These two types of structures are referred to as polycationic or [[amphipathic]], respectively. A third class of CPPs are the hydrophobic peptides, containing only apolar residues, with low net charge
or have hydrophobic amino acid groups that are crucial for cellular uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Milletti |first=Francesca |year=2012 |title=Cell-penetrating peptides: Classes, origin, and current landscape |journal=Drug Discovery Today |volume=17 |issue=15–16 |pages=850–860 |doi=10.1016/j.drudis.2012.03.002 |pmid=22465171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Stalmans |first=Sofie |last2=Wynendaele |first2=Evelien |last3=Bracke |first3=Nathalie |last4=Gevaert |first4=Bert |last5=d'Hondt |first5=Matthias |last6=Peremans |first6=Kathelijne |last7=Burvenich |first7=Christian |last8=De Spiegeleer |first8=Bart |year=2013 |title=Chemical-Functional Diversity in Cell-Penetrating Peptides |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=8 |issue=8 |pages=e71752 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0071752 |pmc=3739727 |pmid=23951237}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first CPP was discovered independently by two laboratories in 1988, when it was found that the trans-activating transcriptional activator (TAT) from [[human immunodeficiency virus 1]] (HIV-1) could be efficiently taken up from the surrounding media by numerous cell types in culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Wagstaff |first=Kylie |last2=Jans |first2=David |year=2006 |title=Protein Transduction: Cell Penetrating Peptides and Their Therapeutic Applications |journal=Current Medicinal Chemistry |volume=13 |issue=12 |pages=1371–1387 |doi=10.2174/092986706776872871}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the number of known CPPs has expanded considerably and small molecule synthetic analogues with more effective protein transduction properties have been generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Okuyama |first=Masahiro |last2=Laman |first2=Heike |last3=Kingsbury |first3=Sarah R. |last4=Visintin |first4=Cristina |last5=Leo |first5=Elisabetta |last6=Eward |first6=Kathryn Leigh |last7=Stoeber |first7=Kai |last8=Boshoff |first8=Chris |last9=Williams |first9=Gareth H. |year=2007 |title=Small-molecule mimics of an α-helix for efficient transport of proteins into cells |journal=Nature Methods |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=153–159 |doi=10.1038/nmeth997 |pmid=17220893 |last10=Selwood |first10=David L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent discovery found that [[Papillomaviridae]] such as the [[Human Papillomavirus]] use CPPs to penetrate the intracellular membrane in order to trigger retrograde trafficking of the viral unit to the nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Zhang |first=Pengwei |last2=Monteiro Da Silva |first2=Gabriel |last3=Deatherage |first3=Catherine |last4=Burd |first4=Christopher |last5=Dimaio |first5=Daniel |year=2018 |title=Cell-Penetrating Peptide Mediates Intracellular Membrane Passage of Human Papillomavirus L2 Protein to Trigger Retrograde Trafficking |journal=Cell |volume=174 |issue=6 |pages=1465–1476.e13 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2018.07.031 |pmc=6128760 |pmid=30122350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms of membrane translocation==

Cell-penetrating peptides are of different sizes, amino acid sequences, and charges but all CPPs have one distinct characteristic, which is the ability to translocate the plasma membrane and facilitate the delivery of various molecular cargoes to the cytoplasm or an organelle. There has been no real consensus as to the mechanism of CPP translocation, but the theories of CPP translocation can be classified into three main entry mechanisms: direct penetration in the membrane, endocytosis-mediated entry, and translocation through the formation of a transitory structure. CPP transduction is an area of ongoing research.

Cell-penetrating peptides (CPP) are able to transport different types of cargo molecules across plasma membrane; thus, they act as molecular delivery vehicles. They have numerous applications in medicine as drug delivery agents in the treatment of different diseases including cancer and virus inhibitors, as well as contrast agents for cell labeling.  Examples of the latter include acting as a carrier for [[Green fluorescent protein|GFP]], MRI contrast agents, or [[quantum dot]]s.

===Direct penetration===
[[File:Direct penetrating example.png|right|thumb|Example of translocation of cargo through direct penetration|400px]]
The majority of early research suggested that the translocation of polycationic CPPs across biological membranes occurred via an energy-independent cellular process. It was believed that translocation could progress at 4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C and most likely involved a direct [[electrostatic]] interaction with negatively charged [[phospholipids]].  Researchers proposed several models in attempts to elucidate the biophysical mechanism of this energy-independent process. Although CPPs promote direct effects on the biophysical properties of pure membrane systems, the identification of fixation artifacts when using fluorescent labeled probe CPPs caused a reevaluation of CPP-import mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/71889| pmid=10625387|title = Synthetic DNA delivery systems| journal=Nature Biotechnology| volume=18| issue=1| pages=33–37|year = 2000|last1 = Luo|first1 = Dan| last2=Saltzman| first2=W. Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies promoted endocytosis as the translocation pathway. An example of direct penetration has been proposed for TAT. The first step in this proposed model is an interaction with the unfolded fusion protein (TAT) and the membrane through electrostatic interactions, which disrupt the membrane enough to allow the fusion protein to cross the membrane. After internalization, the fusion protein refolds due the chaperone system. This mechanism was not agreed upon, and other mechanisms involving clathrin-dependent endocytosis have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1074/jbc.272.25.16010|title = A Truncated HIV-1 Tat Protein Basic Domain Rapidly Translocates through the Plasma Membrane and Accumulates in the Cell Nucleus| journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume=272| issue=25| pages=16010–16017|year = 1997|last1 = Vivès|first1 = Eric| last2=Brodin| first2=Priscille| last3=Lebleu| first3=Bernard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Intracellular Distribution and Mechanism of Delivery of Oligonucleotides Mediated by Cationic Lipids |journal=Pharmaceutical Research|volume=13|issue=9|pages=1367–1372|doi=10.1023/a:1016026101195|year=1996 |last1=Zelphati |first1=Olivier |last2=Szoka, Jr|first2=Francis C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many more detailed methods of CPP uptake have been proposed including transient pore formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.0706574105|pmid = 18093956| pmc=2409222| title=Molecular dynamics simulations suggest a mechanism for translocation of the HIV-1 TAT peptide across lipid membranes| journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume=104| issue=52| pages=20805–20810| year=2007| last1=Herce| first1=H.

This mechanism explains how key ingredients, such as the cooperation among the peptides, the large positive charge, and specifically the guanidinium groups, contribute to the uptake. The proposed mechanism also illustrates the importance of membrane fluctuations. Indeed, mechanisms that involve large fluctuations of the membrane structure, such as transient pores and the insertion of charged amino acid side-chains, may be common and perhaps central to the functions of many membrane protein functions.

===Endocytosis-mediated translocation===
[[File:Endocytosis.png|right|thumb|Types Endocytosis Mediated by Cell-Penetrating Peptides|400px]]

[[Endocytosis]] is the second mechanism liable for cellular internalization.  Endocytosis is the process of cellular [[ingestion]] by which the plasma membrane folds inward to bring substances into the cell. During this process cells absorb material from the outside of the cell by imbibing it with their cell membrane. The classification of cellular localization using fluorescence or by endocytosis inhibitors is the basis of most examination. However, the procedure used during preparation of these samples creates questionable information regarding endocytosis. Moreover, studies show that cellular entry of penetratin by endocytosis is an energy-dependent process. This process is initiated by polyarginines interacting with [[heparan sulphate]]s that promote endocytosis.  Research has shown that TAT is internalized through a form of endocytosis called macropinocytosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(88)90263-2|title = Cellular uptake of the tat protein from human immunodeficiency virus| journal=Cell| volume=55| issue=6| pages=1189–1193|year = 1988|last1 = Frankel|first1 = Alan D.| last2=Pabo| first2=Carl O.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/90741| pmid=11479552|title = Is VP22 nuclear homing an artifact?| journal=Nature Biotechnology| volume=19| issue=8| pages=713–4|year = 2001|last1 = Lundberg|first1 = Mathias| last2=Johansson| first2=Magnus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have illustrated that endocytosis is involved in the internalization of CPPs, but it has been suggested that different mechanisms could transpire at the same time. This is established by the behavior reported for penetratin and transportan wherein both membrane translocation and endocytosis occur concurrently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/s1525-0016(03)00135-7|title = Cell surface adherence and endocytosis of protein transduction domains| journal=Molecular Therapy| volume=8| pages=143–150|year = 2003|last1 = Lundberg|first1 = Mathias| last2=Wikström| first2=Sara| last3=Johansson| first3=Magnus}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1042/bst0350767| pmid=17635144|title = The many futures for cell-penetrating peptides: How soon is now?| journal=Biochemical Society Transactions| volume=35| issue=4| pages=767–769|year = 2007|last1 = Howl|first1 = J.| last2=Nicholl| first2=I.D.| last3=Jones| first3=S.| hdl=2436/29794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translocation through the formation of a transitory structure===

[[File:Inverted micelle1.png|right|thumb|Translocation Mediated by the Formation of Inverted Micelles|400px]]
The third mechanism responsible for the translocation is based on the formation of the inverted [[micelles]]. Inverted micelles are aggregates of colloidal surfactants in which the polar groups are concentrated in the interior and the lipophilic groups extend outward into the solvent. According to this model, a penetratin dimer combines with the negatively charged phospholipids, thus generating the formation of an inverted micelle inside of the lipid bilayer. The structure of the inverted micelles permits the peptide to remain in a hydrophilic environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/la048622b| pmid=15461515|title = Interaction of Primary Amphipathic Cell-Penetrating Peptides with Phospholipid-Supported Monolayers| journal=Langmuir| volume=20| issue=21| pages=9255–9261|year = 2004|last1 = Plénat|first1 = Thomas| last2=Deshayes| first2=Sébastien| last3=Boichot| first3=Sylvie| last4=Milhiet| first4=Pierre Emmanuel| last5=Cole| first5=Richard B.| last6=Heitz| first6=Frédéric| last7=Le Grimellec| first7=Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.bbamem.2004.09.010| pmid=15581849|title = On the mechanism of non-endosomial peptide-mediated cellular delivery of nucleic acids| journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes| volume=1667| issue=2| pages=141–147|year = 2004|last1 = Deshayes|first1 = Sébastien| last2=Gerbal-Chaloin| first2=Sabine| last3=Morris| first3=May C.| last4=Aldrian-Herrada| first4=Gudrun| last5=Charnet| first5=Pierre| last6=Divita| first6=Gilles| last7=Heitz| first7=Frédéric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This non-symmetric distribution produces an electrical field that has been well established. Increasing the amount of peptide on the outer leaflets causes the electric field to reach a critical value that can generate an electroporation-like event.

The last mechanism implied that internalization occurs by peptides that belong to the family of primary amphipathic peptides, MPG and Pep-1. Two very similar models have been proposed based on physicochemical studies, consisting of circular dichroism, Fourier transform infrared, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy.  These models are associated with electrophysiological measurements and investigations that have the ability to mimic model membranes such as monolayer at the air-water interface. The structure giving rise to the pores is the major difference between the proposed MPG and Pep-1 model. In the MPG model, the pore is formed by a b-barrel structure, whereas the Pep-1 is associated with helices. In addition, strong hydrophobic phospholipid-peptide interactions have been discovered in both models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/s0005-2736(01)00304-2|title = Interaction and structure induction of cell-penetrating peptides in the presence of phospholipid vesicles| journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Biomembranes| volume=1512| pages=77–89|year = 2001|last1 = Magzoub|first1 = Mazin| last2=Kilk| first2=Kalle| last3=Eriksson| first3=L.E.Göran| last4=Langel| first4=Ülo| last5=Gräslund| first5=Astrid}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/bi049298m| pmid=15196012|title = Primary Amphipathic Cell-Penetrating Peptides:  Structural Requirements and Interactions with Model Membranes†| journal=Biochemistry| volume=43| issue=24| pages=7698–7706|year = 2004|last1 = Deshayes|first1 = Sébastien| last2=Plénat| first2=Thomas| last3=Aldrian-Herrada| first3=Gudrun| last4=Divita| first4=Gilles| last5=Le Grimellec| first5=Christian| last6=Heitz| first6=Frédéric}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the two peptide models, the folded parts of the carrier molecule correlate to the hydrophobic domain, although the rest of the molecule remains unstructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1074/jbc.271.30.18188|title = Cell Internalization of the Third Helix of the Antennapedia Homeodomain is Receptor-independent| journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry| volume=271| issue=30| pages=18188–18193|year = 1996|last1 = Derossi|first1 = Daniele| last2=Calvet| first2=Sophie| last3=Trembleau| first3=Alain| last4=Brunissen| first4=Alié| last5=Chassaing| first5=Gérard| last6=Prochiantz| first6=Alain}}&lt;/ref&gt;
   
[[File:Barrel.png|right|thumb|Translocation Mediated by a Transitory Structure|400px]]

Cell-penetrating peptide facilitated translocation is a topic of great debate. Evidence has been presented that translocation could use several different pathways for uptake. In addition, the mechanism of translocation can be dependent on whether the peptide is free or attached to cargo. The quantitative uptake of free or CPP connected to cargo can differ greatly but studies have not proven whether this change is a result of translocation efficiency or the difference in translocation pathway. It is probable that the results indicate that several CPP mechanisms are in competition and that several pathways contribute to CPP internalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1042/bst0350811| pmid=17635154|title = Protein transduction: Identification, characterization and optimization| journal=Biochemical Society Transactions| volume=35| issue=4| pages=811–815|year = 2007|last1 = Tilstra|first1 = J.| last2=Rehman| first2=K.K.| last3=Hennon| first3=T.| last4=Plevy| first4=S.E.| last5=Clemens| first5=P.| last6=Robbins| first6=P.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===CPP mediated delivery of nucleic acids===
Nucleic acid-based macromolecules such as siRNA, antisense oligonucleotide, decoy DNA, and plasmid have been realized as promising biological and pharmacological therapeutics in regulation of gene expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1201/9781420006087.ch22|chapter = A Noncovalent Peptide-Based Strategy for Peptide and Short Interfering RNA Delivery|title = Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides, Second Edition| volume=20061339| pages=387–408|series = Pharmacology and Toxicology: Basic and Clinical Aspects|year = 2006|last1 = Morris|first1 = May| last2=Deshayes| first2=Sebastien| last3=Simeoni| first3=Federica| last4=Aldrian-Herrada| first4=Gudrun| last5=Heitz| first5=Frederic| last6=Divita| first6=Gilles| isbn=978-0-8493-5090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.2174/138161205774580796|title = Cell-Penetrating Peptides: Mechanisms and Applications| journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design| volume=11| issue=28| pages=3597–3611|year = 2005|last1 = El-Andaloussi|first1 = S.| last2=Holm| first2=T.| last3=Langel| first3=U.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/s0167-7799(00)01520-1|title = Vectorial delivery of macromolecules into cells using peptide-based vehicles| journal=Trends in Biotechnology| volume=19| pages=21–28|year = 2001|last1 = Gariépy|first1 = Jean| last2=Kawamura| first2=Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike other small-molecular drugs, their development and applications are limited by high molecular weight and negative charges, which results in poor uptake efficiency and low cellular traffic. To overcome these problems, several different delivery systems have been developed, including CPP-nucleic acid conjugate, which is a very powerful tool.

====Formation of CPP-nucleic acid complexes====
[[File:Conjugation of CPPs and cargoes.jpg|right|thumb|Covalent linkage between CPP and nucleic aicd|400px]]
[[File:Covalent linkage between CPP and nucleic aicd.jpg|right|thumb|Covalent linkage between CPP and nucleic acid|400px]]
Most CPP-nucleic acid complexes that have been proposed so far are formed through covalent bonding. A range of CPP-nucleic acid complexes have been synthesized through different chemistries that are either stable or cleavable linkages. And the most widely used method in publication is cleavable disulfide linkages through total stepwise solid-phase synthesis or solution-phase or solid-phase fragment coupling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1201/9781420006087.ch18|chapter = Peptide Conjugates of Oligonucleotide Analogs and siRNA for Gene Expression Modulation|title = Handbook of Cell-Penetrating Peptides, Second Edition| volume=20061339| pages=313–328|series = Pharmacology and Toxicology: Basic and Clinical Aspects|year = 2006|last1 = Turner|first1 = John| last2=Arzumanov| first2=Andrey| last3=Ivanova| first3=Gabriela| last4=Fabani| first4=Martin| last5=Gait| first5=Michael| isbn=978-0-8493-5090-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other strategies like stable amide, thiazolidine, oxime and hydrazine linkage have also been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/jo000214z|title = Efficient Conjugation of Peptides to Oligonucleotides by "Native Ligation"| journal=The Journal of Organic Chemistry| volume=65| issue=16| pages=4900–4908|year = 2000|last1 = Stetsenko|first1 = Dmitry A.| last2=Gait| first2=Michael J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, those covalent linking methods are limited by the concern that the synthetic covalent bond between CPP and nucleic acid may alter the biological activity of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.addr.2007.03.004| pmid=17451840|title = Exogenous siRNA delivery using peptide transduction domains/cell penetrating peptides| journal=Advanced Drug Delivery Reviews| volume=59| issue=2–3| pages=134–140|year = 2007|last1 = Meade|first1 = Bryan R.| last2=Dowdy| first2=Steven F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, a new non-covalent strategy requiring no chemical modification with short amphipathic CPPs, like MPG and Pep-1 as carriers has been successfully applied for delivery of cargoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1093/nar/25.14.2730|title = A new peptide vector for efficient delivery of oligonucleotides into mammalian cells| journal=Nucleic Acids Research| volume=25| issue=14| pages=2730–2736|year = 1997|last1 = Morris|first1 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="F.

With this method, cargoes such as nucleic acids and proteins could be efficiently delivered while maintaining full biological activity.

====For siRNA delivery====
[[Short interfering RNA]] (siRNA) is a very powerful new tool that can interfere with and silence the expression of specific disease gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nrd2310| pmid=17541417|title = Interfering with disease: A progress report on siRNA-based therapeutics| journal=Nature Reviews Drug Discovery| volume=6| issue=6| pages=443–453|year = 2007|last1 = De Fougerolles|first1 = Antonin| last2=Vornlocher| first2=Hans-Peter| last3=Maraganore| first3=John| last4=Lieberman| first4=Judy}}&lt;/ref&gt; To improve cellular uptake of siRNA, CPP strategies have been applied to facilitate the delivery of siRNA into cells through either covalent or non-covalent linkages. In one study, siRNA is covalently linked to transportan and penetratin by disulfide-linkage at 5'-end of the sense strands of siRNA to target luciferase or eGFP mRNA reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/s0014-5793(03)01505-9| pmid=14759517|title = Conjugate for efficient delivery of short interfering RNA (siRNA) into mammalian cells| journal=FEBS Letters| volume=558| issue=1–3| pages=63–68|year = 2004|last1 = Muratovska|first1 = Aleksandra| last2=Eccles| first2=Michael R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, TAT-siRNA conjugate through a stable thiomaleimide linkage at 3'-end of siRNA was delivered into HeLa cells for eGFP gene silencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.chembiol.2004.06.006| pmid=15324818|title = Visualizing a Correlation between siRNA Localization, Cellular Uptake, and RNAi in Living Cells| journal=Chemistry &amp; Biology| volume=11| issue=8| pages=1165–1175|year = 2004|last1 = Chiu|first1 = Ya-Lin| last2=Ali| first2=Akbar| last3=Chu| first3=Chia-Ying| last4=Cao| first4=Hong| last5=Rana| first5=Tariq M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, non-covalent strategies appear to be better for siRNA delivery with a more significant biological response. In one study, MPG/siRNA complexes formed through stable non-covalent strategy showed successful introduction of siRNA into cultured cells and induced robust regulation of target mRNA.&lt;ref name="F. Simeoni, M.C. Morris 2003" /&gt; Furthermore, MPG/siRNA complexes have also been applied for delivery of siRNA ''in vivo'' into mouse blastocytes for gene regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.devcel.2006.07.013| pmid=17011492|title = Oct-3/4 Dose Dependently Regulates Specification of Embryonic Stem Cells toward a Cardiac Lineage and Early Heart Development| journal=Developmental Cell| volume=11| issue=4| pages=535–546|year = 2006|last1 = Zeineddine|first1 = Dana| last2=Papadimou| first2=Evangelia| last3=Chebli| first3=Karim| last4=Gineste| first4=Mathieu| last5=Liu| first5=Jun| last6=Grey| first6=Corinne| last7=Thurig| first7=Sherry| last8=Behfar| first8=Atta| last9=Wallace| first9=Valerie A.| last10=Skerjanc| first10=Ilona S.| last11=Pucéat| first11=Michel}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPG forms highly stable complexes with siRNA with a low degradation rate and can be easily functionalized for specific targeting, which are major advantages compared with the covalent CPP technology.

====New substrate design for siRNA delivery====

siRNA cell delivery represent a valuable tool for treatment of cancer disease, viral infections and genetic disorders. However, classical strategies involve covalent linking of cargo molecules and CPPs, which does not provide efficient protection of siRNA  molecules ''in vivo''; thus results reported in literature are not consistent. Recently, non-covalent strategies have been successfully reported. Secondary amphipathic peptides based on aromatic tryptophan and arginine residues linked with lysine as spacer have been reported under the name of CADY. CADY contains a short peptide sequence of 20 amino acids, with the sequence “Ac-GLWRALWRLLRSLWRLLWRA-cysteamide."
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/mt.2008.215| pmid=18957965| pmc=2834975|title = A New Potent Secondary Amphipathic Cell–penetrating Peptide for siRNA Delivery into Mammalian Cells| journal=Molecular Therapy| volume=17| issue=1| pages=95–103|year = 2009|last1 = Crombez|first1 = Laurence| last2=Aldrian-Herrada| first2=Gudrun| last3=Konate| first3=Karidia| last4=Nguyen| first4=Quan N.| last5=McMaster| first5=Gary K.| last6=Brasseur| first6=Robert| last7=Heitz| first7=Frederic| last8=Divita| first8=Gilles}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This peptide is able to self-assemble in a helical shape with hydrophilic and hydrophobic residues on different side of the molecule, it has two  different orientations  of the surface that represent the lowest energy and it is able to form complexes with siRNA  at different molar ratio  varying from 1:1 to  80:1.  
CADY is able to form a shield around siRNA molecule protecting it from biodegradative processes that may occur before cellular penetration occurs. These types of substrates may present important applications ''in vivo''.

====For antisense oligomer delivery====
Antisense oligonucleotides (asONs) have been used in basic research and are being developed as possible medical treatments. CPP strategies have been developed to deliver antisense oligomers such as PNA and PMO into cells. Overcoming the repulsion by the cell membrane of negative-charged ONs and the degradation of asONs by enzymes, CPPs increase asONs bioavailability. Two types of neutral ON analogues, peptide nucleic acid ([[Peptide nucleic acid|PNA]]) and phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMO or [[Morpholino]]) are becoming dominant in this area. PNA has been conjugated with various CPPs either through disulfide linkages or through stable amide bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.2174/138161205774580769|title = Conjugates of Oligonucleotides and Analogues with Cell Penetrating Peptides as Gene Silencing Agents| journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design| volume=11| issue=28| pages=3639–3654|year = 2005|last1 = Zatsepin|first1 = T.| last2=Turner| first2=J.| last3=Oretskaya| first3=T.| last4=Gait| first4=M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, antisense activity within cells that blocked expression of the galanin receptor was observed when a 21-mer PNA was coupled to the penetratin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nbt0998-857| pmid=9743120|title = Cell penetrating PNA constructs regulate galanin receptor levels and modify pain transmission in vivo| journal=Nature Biotechnology| volume=16| issue=9| pages=857–861|year = 1998|last1 = Pooga|first1 = Margus| last2=Soomets| first2=Ursel| last3=Hällbrink| first3=Mattias| last4=Valkna| first4=Andres| last5=Saar| first5=Külliki| last6=Rezaei| first6=Khadijeh| last7=Kahl| first7=Ulrika| last8=Hao| first8=Jing-Xia| last9=Xu| first9=Xiao-Jun| last10=Wiesenfeld-Hallin| first10=Zsuzsanna| last11=Hökfelt| first11=Tomas| last12=Bartfai| first12=Tamas| last13=Langel| first13=Ülo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results on antiviral activity with PNA targeting HIV-1 have also been reported through disulfide linkage with TAT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.virol.2007.01.016| pmid=17320140| pmc=2038983|title = Anti HIV-1 virucidal activity of polyamide nucleic acid-membrane transducing peptide conjugates targeted to primer binding site of HIV-1 genome| journal=Virology| volume=363| issue=1| pages=91–103|year = 2007|last1 = Tripathi|first1 = Snehlata| last2=Chaubey| first2=Binay| last3=Barton| first3=Beverly E.| last4=Pandey| first4=Virendra N.}}&lt;/ref&gt; CPP-PMO conjugates have also been successfully used to inhibit the replication of several viruses such as SARS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-0-387-33012-9_103| pmid=17037599|chapter = Inhibition and Escape of SARS-CoV Treated with Antisense Morpholino Oligomers|title = The Nidoviruses| volume=581| pages=567–571|series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology|year = 2006|last1 = Neuman|first1 = Benjamin W.| last2=Stein| first2=David A.| last3=Kroeker| first3=Andrew D.| last4=Bestwick| first4=Richard K.| last5=Iversen| first5=Patrick L.| last6=Moulton| first6=Hong M.| last7=Buchmeier| first7=Michael J.| isbn=978-0-387-26202-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and influenza&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1128/aac.00644-06| pmid=16966399| pmc=1635187|title = Inhibition of Multiple Subtypes of Influenza a Virus in Cell Cultures with Morpholino Oligomers| journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy| volume=50| issue=11| pages=3724–3733|year = 2006|last1 = Ge|first1 = Q.| last2=Pastey| first2=M.| last3=Kobasa| first3=D.| last4=Puthavathana| first4=P.| last5=Lupfer| first5=C.| last6=Bestwick| first6=R.

===CPP mediated delivery of proteins===
The development of therapeutic proteins that has presented a valuable method to treat diseases is limited by low efficiency of traditional delivery methods. The evaluation of cytosolic delivery of CPP linked proteins has been found to be prone to artifacts&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=12411431|year=2003|last1=Richard|first1=J.

Several groups have successfully delivered CPP fused proteins ''in vitro''.  TAT was able to deliver different proteins, such as horseradish peroxidase and RNase A across cell membrane into the cytoplasm in different cell lines ''in vitro''. The size range of proteins with effective delivery is from 30kDa to 120-150kDa. In one study, TAT-fused proteins are rapidly internalized by lipid raft−dependent macropinocytosis using a transducible TAT−Cre recombinase reporter assay on live cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nm996| pmid=14770178|title = Transducible TAT-HA fusogenic peptide enhances escape of TAT-fusion proteins after lipid raft macropinocytosis| journal=Nature Medicine| volume=10| issue=3| pages=310–315|year = 2004|last1 = Wadia|first1 = Jehangir S.| last2=Stan| first2=Radu V.| last3=Dowdy| first3=Steven F.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another study, a TAT-fused protein was delivered into mitochondria of breast cancer cells and decreased the survival of breast cancer cells, which showed capability of TAT-fusion proteins to modulate mitochondrial function and cell survival. Moreover, cR10, a cyclic poly-arginine CPP, enabled the endocytose independent transduction of antigen binding proteins through the cellular membrane with immediate bioavailability. Thereby, the authors of the study were able to deliver fluorescent antigen binding proteins into cells facilitating live-cell immunostaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herce|first1=H.

In one study, in vivo delivery of TAT- or penetratin-crosslinked Fab fragments yielded varied organ distributions and an overall increase in organ retention, which showed tissue localization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1021/bc050258k| pmid=16704196|title = Effects of Cell-Permeating Peptide Binding on the Distribution of125I-Labeled Fab Fragment in Rats| journal=Bioconjugate Chemistry| volume=17| issue=3| pages=597–602|year = 2006|last1 = Kameyama|first1 = Shouju| last2=Horie| first2=Mayo| last3=Kikuchi| first3=Takeo| last4=Omura| first4=Takao| last5=Takeuchi| first5=Toshihide| last6=Nakase| first6=Ikuhiko| last7=Sugiura| first7=Yukio| last8=Futaki| first8=Shiroh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-covalent method that forms CPP/protein complexes has also been developed to address the limitations in covalent methods, such as chemical modification before crosslinking, and denaturation of proteins before delivery. In one study, a short amphipathic peptide carrier, Pep-1, and protein complexes have proven effective for delivery. It was shown that Pep-1 could facilitate rapid cellular uptake of various peptides, proteins, and even full-length antibodies with high efficiency and less toxicity. This approach has greatly simplified the formulation of reagents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1038/nbt1201-1173| pmid=11731788|title = A peptide carrier for the delivery of biologically active proteins into mammalian cells| journal=Nature Biotechnology| volume=19| issue=12| pages=1173–1176|year = 2001|last1 = Morris|first1 = May C.| last2=Depollier| first2=Julien| last3=Mery| first3=Jean| last4=Heitz| first4=Frederic| last5=Divita| first5=Gilles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As contrast agents transporters ===

[[File:Opening angle cpp.jpg|right|thumb|Folding control of CPP using unnatural β, δ cyclic amino acids |400px]]

CPPs found applications as transporters of contrast agents across plasma membranes. These contrast agents are able to label the tumor cells, making the compounds important tools in cancer diagnosis; they are also used in ''in vivo'' and ''in vitro'' cellular experiments. 
The most important classes of CPP are isolated from viruses, such as TAT (transactivated-transcription) derived from HIV-1, penetratin, and transportan. The most widely used CPPs are based on TAT derivatives. TAT is an arginine-rich CPP. Several improvements for this substrate includes the usage of unnatural β or γ amino acids. This strategy offers multiple advantages, such resistance to proteolytic degradation, a natural degradation process by which peptide bonds are hydrolyzed to amino acids.  Unnatural acid insertion in the peptide chain has multiple advantages. It facilitates the formation of stable foldamers with distinct secondary structure.&lt;ref&gt;Cheng, R. P., S. H. Gellman, and W. F. DeGrado. 2001. Peptides: from structure to function. Chem. Rev. 101:3219–3232.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Seebach, D., S. Abele, J. V. Schreiber, B. Martinoni, A. K. Nussbaum, H.

Potocky, T., B., English, E., B.,  Gellman, S., H., and Brandt, C., R., ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY, 2008, 2120–2129.&lt;/ref&gt; β-Peptides are conformationally more stable in aqueous solution than naturally occurring peptides, especially for small chains. The secondary structure is reinforced by the presence of a rigid β-amino acid, which contains cyclohexane or cyclopentane  fragments. These fragments generate a more rigid structure and influence the opening angle of the foldamer.  These features are very important for new peptide design. Helical β-peptides mimic antimicrobial activities of host defense peptides.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, D., and W. F. DeGrado. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001(123),7553–7559.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, E. A., X. Wang, H. S. Lee, B. Weisblum, and S. H. Gellman, Nature, 2000, 404-565.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soc. 2002(124),. 12774–12785.&lt;/ref&gt; This feature requires the orientation of cationic –hydrophilic on one side, and hydrophobic  residues on the other side of the helix. The attachment of fluorescent group on one head of the molecule confers contrast properties.
A new strategy to enhance the cellular up-take capacity of CPP is based on association of polycationic and polyanionic domains that are separated by a linker. Cellular association of polycationic residues (polyarginine) with negatively charged membrane cells is effectively blocked by the presence of polyanionic residue (poly-glutamic acid) and the linker, which confer the proper distance between these two charged residues in order to maximize their interaction.  These peptides adopt hairpin structure, confirmed by overhauser effect correlation for proton-proton proximities of the two charged moieties.
At this stage only the linker is exposed to protease hydrolysis ''in vivo'' applications. The linker hydrolysis occur and the two charged fragments experience more conformational freedom.  In the absence of linker, the cationic peptide can interact more efficient with the target cell and cellular uptake occurs before proteolysis. This strategy found applications in labeling tumor cells ''in vivo''. Tumor cells were marked in minutes.
Linker degradation can be predicted by the amount of D-aminoacids (the unnatural isomer) incorporated in the peptide chain, this restricts ''in vivo'' proteolysis to the central linker.

====Contrast agents as cargo molecules====

=====Quantum dots=====

[[File:quantum dots CPP.jpg|right|thumb|Quantum dots applications as cell labeling|400px]]

[[Quantum dots]] (QD) represent a relative new class of fluorescent probes that have superior optical properties than classical organic dyes based on fluorescent groups. The main advantages of QD include high quantum yields, broad absorption spectra, size-tunable emission spectra, and good resistance to chemical and photochemical degradation. 
In vivo tests have shown that several positively charged peptides (based on guanidine residues) are able to cross cell membranes and to promote cellular uptake of attached molecules including quantum dots.
QD properties can be easily modified by changing the organic substrates linked to them, offering a versatile biological tool as cell markers. Research is in progress to optimize the methodologies for the intracellular delivery of QD and QD bioconjugates, and characterization of long-term in vivo photophysical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Delehanty, J., B., Medintz, I., L., Pons, T., Brunel, F., M., Dawson P., E.,  Mattoussi, H., Bioconjugate Chem. 2006, 17, 920-927.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alivisatos, A. P., Gu, W., and Larabell, C. A., Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng. 2005(7), 55-76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alivisatos, P., Nat. Biotechnol. 2004(22,) 47-52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medintz, I. L., Uyeda, Nat. Mater. 4, 435-446.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parak, W. J., Gerion, D., Pellegrino, T., Zanchet, D., Micheel, C., Williams, S. C., Boudreau, R., Le Gros, M. A., Larabell, C. A., and Alivisatos, A. P., Nanotechnology (2003)14, R15-R27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parak, W., Pellegrino, T., and Plank, C., Nanotechnology 2005(16), R9-R25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantum dots are colloidal nanocrystals, based on a cadmium-selenium (CdSe) core covered with a zinc-sulfur (ZnS) layer. This substrate has been used intensively as a cellular marker because CdSe emits in the visible domain and is an excellent contrast agent, while the ZnS layer protects the core from oxidation and also the leeching of CdSe into the surrounding solution. This strategy  also improves the photo-luminescence yield. The properties can be tuned by the thickness of the ZnS protective layers. Colloidal QD emission can be modulated from UV-Vis to the infrared by using different types of coating agents, such as ZnS, CdS, ZnSe, CdTe and PbSe. The properties of quantum dots can be also tuned by the synthetic scheme, high temperature solvent/ligand mixtures that influence the nanocrystal properties. High-quality QD contrast agents are obtained at elevated temperatures; however, because they have lower water solubility, their usage as cell markers is limited. Further functionalization with hydrophilic ligands is required.&lt;ref&gt;Dabbousi, B. O. et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 1997(101), 9463–9475.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Medintz, I., L., Uyeda, H., T., Goldman, E., R., Mattoussi, H., Nature Materials, 2005,(4) 435-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages of QD are represented by their fast action; they are able to label a target tissue or cell in seconds. In vivo studies show that QD are able to selectively label cancer cells, and they accumulate at tumor sites. Tumor cells labeled with QD can be tracked with multiphoton microscopy as they invade lung tissue. In both studies, spectral imaging and autofluorescent subtraction allowed multicolour in vivo visualization of cells and tissues. A major drawback of QD is their relatively high toxicity. Functionalizations with different substrates that increase bioaffinity and decrease toxicity are in progress. For instance, sulfur from the QD shell is able to form reversible disulfide bonds with a wide class of organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;Gao, X., Cui, Y., Levenson, R., M., Chung, L., W., K., Nie, S., Nature Biotechnol. 2004(22), 969–976.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Voura, E. B., Jaiswal, J. K., Mattoussi, H. &amp; Simon, S. M. Nature Med. 2004(10), 993–998.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magnetic resonance imaging====

[[File:MRI-CPP.jpg|right|thumb|Examples of metal chelates successfully delivered into cells |400px]]

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful tool for disease diagnosis such as cancer metastasis and inflammation, using different metal chelates. Metal chelates increase the contrast signal between normal and diseased tissues by changing the nuclear relaxation times of water molecules in their proximities. Typical examples are Gd3+ low-molecular-weight chelates, and superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO). ''In vivo'' administration of these agents allows the label of tumor cells; or cells can be labeled ''in vitro'' with contrast agents and then they can be injected and monitored ''in vivo'' by using MRI techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, B. K., Zywicke, H., Miller, B., van Gelderen, P., Moskowitz, B. M., Duncan, I. D., and Frank, J. A., Nat. Biotechnol. 2001(19), 1141–1147.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittet, M. J., Swirski, P. K., Reynolds, F., Josephson, L., and Weissleder, R.,  Nat. Protoc. 2006(1), 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foster, P. J., Dunn, E. A., Karl, K. E., Snir, J. A., Nycz, C. M., Harvey, A. J., and Pettis, R. J., Neoplasia 2008(10), 207–216.&lt;/ref&gt;

SPIO nanoparticles confer high sensitivity in MRI but they have lower affinity for cells; they work at high concentrations. Functionalizations of these compounds using dendrimeric guanidines showed similar activities as TAT-based CPPs but higher toxicity. New substrates based on dendrons with hydroxyl or amine peripheries show low toxicity. Applications of SPIO includes cell labeling ''in vivo''; due to low toxicity, they are clinically approved for use in liver, spleen, and gastrointestinal imaging.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, A., L., Bernas, L., M., Rutt, B., K., Foster, P., J., Gillies, E., R., Bioconjugate Chem. 2008(19), 2375–2384.&lt;/ref&gt;

The presence of octamer arginine residues allows cell membrane transduction of various cargo molecules including peptides, DNA, siRNA, and contrast agents. However, the ability of cross caca membrane is not unidirectional; arginine-based CPPs are able to enter-exit the cell membrane, displaying an overall decreasing concentration of contrast agent and a decrease of magnetic resonance (MR) signal in time. This limits their application ''in vivo''. To solve this problem, contrast agents with disulfide, reversible bond between metal chelate and transduction moiety enhance the cell-associated retention. The disulfide bond is reduced by the target cell environment and the metal chelate remains trapped in the cytoplasm, increasing the retention time of chelate in the target cell.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, M. J., MacRenaris, K. W., Venkatasubramanian, P. N., and Meade, T. J. (2004) Chem. Biol. 2004(11), 301–307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Futaki, S., Adv.

This wave is right-circularly-polarized, since the direction of rotation of the vector is related by the [[right-hand rule]] to the direction the wave is moving; or left-circularly-polarized according to alternative convention.]]

In [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]], '''circular polarization''' of an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]] is a [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] state in which, at each point, the [[electric field]] of the wave has a constant magnitude but its direction rotates with time at a steady rate in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the wave.

In electrodynamics the strength and direction of an electric field is defined by its electric field vector. In the case of a circularly polarized wave, as seen in the accompanying animation, the tip of the electric field [[Euclidean vector|vector]], at a given point in space, describes a circle as time progresses. At any instant of time, the electric field vector of the wave describes a [[helix]] along the direction of propagation. A circularly polarized wave can be in one of two possible states, ''right circular polarization'' in which the electric field vector rotates in a [[Right-hand rule|right-hand]] sense with respect to the direction of propagation, and ''left circular polarization'' in which the vector rotates in a [[left hand rule|left-hand]] sense.

Circular polarization is a [[limiting case (mathematics)|limiting case]] of the more general condition of [[elliptical polarization]]. The other [[special case]] is the easier-to-understand [[linear polarization]].

The phenomenon of polarization arises as a consequence of the fact that [[light]] behaves as a two-dimensional [[Transverse wave#Explanation|transverse wave]].

On the right is an illustration of the electric field [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s of a circularly polarized electromagnetic wave.&lt;ref name=conventions&gt;For handedness conventions refer to the well referenced section [[#Left/Right|Left/Right Handedness Conventions]]&lt;/ref&gt; The electric field vectors have a constant [[Magnitude (vector)|magnitude]] but their direction changes in a rotary manner. Given that this is a [[plane wave]], each vector represents the magnitude and direction of the electric field for an entire plane that is perpendicular to the axis. Specifically, given that this is a [[Plane wave#Polarized electromagnetic plane waves|circularly polarized plane wave]], these vectors indicate that the electric field, from plane to plane, has a constant strength while its direction steadily rotates. Refer to [[Plane wave#Polarized electromagnetic plane waves|these two images]] in the plane wave article to better appreciate this. This light is considered to be right-hand, clockwise circularly polarized if viewed by the receiver. Since this is an [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic wave]] each [[electric field]] vector has a corresponding, but not illustrated, [[magnetic field]] vector that is at a [[right angle]] to the electric field vector and [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] in magnitude to it. As a result, the magnetic field vectors would trace out a second helix if displayed.

Circular polarization is often encountered in the field of optics and in this section, the electromagnetic wave will be simply referred to as [[light]].

The nature of circular polarization and its relationship to other polarizations is often understood by thinking of the electric field as being divided into two [[Euclidean vector|components]] which are at right angles to each other. Refer to the second illustration on the right. The vertical component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in blue while the horizontal component and its corresponding plane are illustrated in green. Notice that the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal component leads the vertical component by one quarter of a [[wavelength]]. It is this [[In-phase and quadrature components|quadrature phase]] relationship which creates the [[helix]] and causes the points of maximum magnitude of the vertical component to correspond with the points of zero magnitude of the horizontal component, and vice versa. The result of this alignment is that there are select vectors, corresponding to the helix, which exactly match the maxima of the vertical and horizontal components. (To minimize visual clutter these are the only helix vectors displayed.)

To appreciate how this quadrature [[phase (waves)|phase]] shift corresponds to an electric field that rotates while maintaining a constant magnitude, imagine a dot traveling clockwise in a circle. Consider how the vertical and horizontal [[Displacement (vector)|displacements]] of the dot, relative to the center of the circle, vary [[Sine wave|sinusoidally]] in time and are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle. The displacements are said to be out of phase by one quarter of a cycle because the horizontal maximum displacement (toward the left) is reached one quarter of a cycle before the vertical maximum displacement is reached. Now referring again to the illustration, imagine the center of the circle just described, traveling along the axis from the front to the back. The circling dot will trace out a helix with the displacement toward our viewing left, leading the vertical displacement. Just as the horizontal and vertical displacements of the rotating dot are out of phase by one quarter of a cycle in time, the magnitude of the horizontal and vertical components of the electric field are out of phase by one quarter of a wavelength.

The next pair of illustrations is that of left-handed, counter-clockwise circularly polarized light when viewed by the receiver. Because it is left-handed, the rightward (relative to the direction of travel) horizontal component is now ''lagging'' the vertical component by one quarter of a wavelength rather than leading it.

===Reversal of handedness by phase shift===
To convert a given handedness of polarized light to the other handedness one can use a half-[[waveplate]]. A half-waveplate shifts a given component of light one half of a wavelength relative to the component to which it is orthogonal.

===Reversal of handedness by reflection===
The handedness of polarized light is also reversed when it is reflected off a surface at normal incidence. Upon such reflection, the rotation of the [[plane of polarization]] of the reflected light is identical to that of the incident field. However, with propagation now in the ''opposite'' direction, the same rotation direction that would be described as "right handed" for the incident beam, is "left-handed" for propagation in the reverse direction, and vice versa. Aside from the reversal of handedness, the ellipticity of polarization is also preserved (except in cases of reflection by a [[Birefringence|birefringent]] surface).

Note that this principle only holds strictly for light reflected at normal incidence. For instance, right circularly polarized light reflected from a dielectric surface at grazing incidence (an angle beyond the [[Brewster's angle|Brewster angle]]) will still emerge as right handed, but elliptically, polarized. Light reflected by a metal at non-normal incidence will generally have its ellipticity changed as well. Such situations may be solved by decomposing the incident circular (or other) polarization into components of linear polarization parallel and perpendicular to the [[plane of incidence]], commonly denoted ''p'' and ''s'' respectively. The reflected components in the ''p'' and ''s'' linear polarizations are found by applying the [[Fresnel equations|Fresnel coefficients]] of reflection, which are generally different for those two linear polarizations. Only in the special case of normal incidence, where there is no distinction between ''p'' and ''s'', are the Fresnel coefficients for the two components identical, leading to the above property.

Note that without glasses both the beetles and their images have shiny color. The right-polarizer removes the color of the beetles but leaves the color of the images. The left-polarizer does the opposite showing reversal of handedness of the reflected light.]]

===Conversion to and from linear polarization===
Circularly polarized light can be converted into linearly polarized light by passing it through a quarter-[[waveplate]]. Passing linearly polarized light through a quarter-waveplate with its axes at 45° to its polarization axis will convert it to circular polarization. In fact, this is the most common way of producing circular polarization in practice. Note that passing linearly polarized light through a quarter-waveplate at an angle ''other'' than 45° will generally produce elliptical polarization.

Circular polarization may be referred to as right-handed or left-handed, and clockwise or anti-clockwise, depending on the direction in which the electric field vector rotates. Unfortunately, two opposing historical conventions exist.

=== From the point of view of the source ===

Using this convention, polarization is defined from the point of view of the source. When using this convention, left or right handedness is determined by pointing one's left or right thumb '''away''' from the source, in the '''same''' direction that the wave is propagating, and matching the curling of one's fingers to the direction of the spatial rotation of the field at a given point in space. When determining if the wave is clockwise or anti-clockwise circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the source, and while looking '''away''' from the source and in the '''same''' direction of the wave’s propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s spatial rotation.

Using this convention, the electric field vector of a right handed circularly polarized wave is as follows:
&lt;math&gt; \left( E_x ,\, E_y ,\, E_z \right) \propto \left(\cos \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \left(c t - z \right),\, \sin \frac{2 \pi}{\lambda} \left(c t - z \right),\, 0 \right) . &lt;/math&gt;

As a specific example, refer to the circularly polarized wave in the first animation. Using this convention that wave is defined as right-handed because when one points one's right thumb in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the fingers of that hand curl in the same direction of the field’s temporal rotation. It is considered clockwise circularly polarized because from the point of view of the source, looking in the same direction of the wave’s propagation, the field rotates in the clockwise direction. The second animation is that of left-handed or anti-clockwise light using this same convention.

This convention is in conformity with the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) standard and as a result it is generally used in the engineering community.&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Std 149-1979 (R2008), "IEEE Standard Test Procedures for Antennas". Reaffirmed December 10, 2008, Approved December 15, 1977, IEEE-SA Standards Board. Approved October 9, 2003, American National Standards Institute. {{ISBN|0-471-08032-2}}. {{doi|10.1109/IEEESTD.1979.120310}}, sec. 11.1, p.&amp;nbsp;61."the sense of polarization, or handedness ... is called right handed (left handed) if the direction of rotation is clockwise (anti-clockwise) for an observer looking in the direction of propagation"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Orfanidis&gt;Electromagnetic Waves &amp; Antennas – S. J. Orfanidis: Footnote p.45, "most engineering texts use the IEEE convention and most physics texts, the opposite convention."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Electromagnetic Waves &amp; Antennas – S. J. Orfanidis Pg 44 "Curl the fingers of your left and right hands into a fist and point both thumbs ''towards'' the direction of propagation"&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantum physicists also use this convention of handedness because it is consistent with their convention of handedness for a particle’s spin.&lt;ref name="Lectures_on_Physics(Vol_1_ch_33-1)" &gt;Lectures on Physics Feynman (Vol. 1, ch.33-1) "If the end of the electric vector, when we look at it as the light comes straight toward us, goes around in an anti-clockwise direction, we call it right-hand circular polarization. ... Our convention for labeling left-hand and right-hand circular polarization is consistent with that which is used today for all the other particles in physics which exhibit polarization (e.g., electrons). However, in some books on optics the opposite conventions are used, so one must be careful."&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio astronomers also use this convention in accordance with an [[International Astronomical Union|International Astronomical Union (IAU)]] resolution made in 1973.&lt;ref name=IAU&gt;IAU General Assembly Meeting, 1973, Commission 40 (Radio Astronomy/Radioastronomie), 8. POLARIZATION DEFINITIONS -- "A working Group chaired by Westerhout was convened to discuss the definition of polarization brightness temperatures used in the description of polarized extended objects and the galactic
background. The following resolution was adopted by Commissions 25 and 40: 'RESOLVED, that the frame of reference for the Stokes parameters is that of Right Ascension and Declination with the position angle of electric-vector maximum, q, starting from North and increasing through East. Elliptical polarization is defined in conformity with the definitions of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE Standard 211, 1969). This means that the polarization of incoming radiation, for which the position angle, q, of the electric vector, measured at a fixed point in space, increases with time, is described as right-handed and positive.'"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From the point of view of the receiver ===

In this alternative convention, polarization is defined from the point of view of the receiver. Using this convention, left or right handedness is determined by pointing one’s left or right thumb '''toward''' the source, '''against''' the direction of propagation, and then matching the curling of one's fingers to the temporal rotation of the field.

When using this convention, in contrast to the other convention, the defined handedness of the wave matches the handedness of the screw type nature of the field in space. Specifically, if one freezes a right-handed wave in time, when one curls the fingers of one’s right hand around the helix, the thumb will point in the direction which the helix progresses given that sense of rotation. Note that it is the nature of all screws and helices that it does not matter in which direction you point your thumb when determining its handedness.

When determining if the wave is clockwise or anti-clockwise circularly polarized, one again takes the point of view of the receiver and, while looking '''toward''' the source, '''against''' the direction of propagation, one observes the direction of the field’s temporal rotation.

Just as in the other convention, right-handedness corresponds to a clockwise rotation and left-handedness corresponds to an anti-clockwise rotation.

Many optics textbooks use this second convention.&lt;ref name="Polarization_in_Spectral_Lines_Section_1.2"&gt;Polarization in Spectral Lines. 2004 E. Landi Degl’innocenti, M Landolfi Section 1.2 "When ... the tip of the electric field vector rotates clockwise for an observer facing the radiation source, ... (it will be considered)... positive (or righthanded) circular polarization, Our convention, ... agrees with those proposed in the classical textbooks on polarized light by Shurcliff (1952) and by Clarke and Grainger (1971). The same convention is also used, although with some few exceptions, by optical astronomers working in the field of polarimetry. Many radio astronomers, on the other hand, use the opposite convention. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8sl2CkmZNWIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=circular+polarization+conventions#v=onepage&amp;q=circular%20polarization%20conventions&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HANDBOOK OPTICS Volume I,Devices, Measurements and Properties,Michael Bass Page 272 Footnote: "Right-circularly polarized light is defined as a clockwise rotation of the electric vector when the observer is looking ''against'' the direction the wave is traveling."&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used by [[SPIE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Polarization Ellipse|url=https://spie.org/publications/fg05_p07-09_polarization_ellipse|website=spie.org|accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Uses of the two conventions ===

As stated earlier, there is significant confusion with regards to these two conventions. As a general rule the engineering, quantum physics, and radio astronomy communities use the first convention where the wave is observed from the point of view of the source.&lt;ref name=Orfanidis /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lectures_on_Physics(Vol_1_ch_33-1)" /&gt;&lt;ref name=IAU /&gt; In many physics textbooks dealing with optics the second convention is used where the light is observed from the point of view of the receiver.&lt;ref name="Lectures_on_Physics(Vol_1_ch_33-1)" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Polarization_in_Spectral_Lines_Section_1.2" /&gt;

To avoid confusion, it is good practice to specify “as defined from the point of view of the source” or "as defined from the point of view of the receiver" when discussing polarization matters.

The archive of the [http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/ US Federal Standard 1037C] proposes two contradictory conventions of handedness.&lt;ref&gt;In one location it is stated..."Note 1. ... In general, the figure, i.e., polarization, is elliptical and is traced in a clockwise or anti-clockwise sense, as viewed in the direction of propagation. ... Rotation of the electric vector in a clockwise sense is designated right-hand polarization, and rotation in a anti-clockwise sense is designated left-hand polarization . "[http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037//dir-028/_4059.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5x7CwBtjf?url=http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/|date=2011-03-11}} In another location it is stated... "Note 4: Circular polarization may be referred to as "right-hand" or "left-hand," depending on whether the helix describes the thread of a right-hand or left-hand screw, respectively." [http://www.its.bldrdoc.gov/fs-1037/dir-007/_0972.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==FM radio==
The term "circular polarization" is often used erroneously to describe mixed polarity signals{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} used mostly in [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]] (87.5 to 108.0&amp;nbsp;MHz in the USA), where a vertical and a horizontal component are propagated simultaneously by a single or a combined array. This has the effect of producing greater penetration into buildings and difficult reception areas than a signal with just one plane of polarization. This would be an instance where the polarization would more appropriately be called random polarization because the polarization at a receiver, although constant, will vary depending on the direction from the transmitter and other factors in the transmitting antenna design. See [[Stokes parameters]].&lt;br /&gt;
The term "FM radio" above refers to broadcast radio, not 2-way radio (more properly called [[Land mobile radio system|land mobile radio]]), which uses vertical polarization almost exclusively.

==Circular dichroism==
{{Main article|Circular dichroism}}
'''Circular dichroism (CD)''' is the differential absorption of left- and right-handed circularly polarized [[light]]. Circular dichroism is the basis of a form of [[spectroscopy]] that can be used to determine the [[Chirality (chemistry)|optical isomerism]] and secondary structure of [[molecule]]s.

In general, this phenomenon will be exhibited in absorption bands of any [[optical activity|optically active]] molecule. As a consequence, circular dichroism is exhibited by most biological molecules, because of the [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|dextrorotary]] (e.g. some [[sugar]]s) and [[Dextrorotation and levorotation|levorotary]] (e.g. some [[amino acid]]s) molecules they contain. Noteworthy as well is that a [[secondary structure]] will also impart a distinct CD to its respective molecules. Therefore, the [[alpha helix]], [[beta sheet]] and [[random coil]] regions of proteins and the [[Nucleic acid double helix|double helix]] of [[nucleic acid]]s have CD spectral signatures representative of their structures.

Also, under the right conditions, even non-chiral molecules will exhibit [[magnetic circular dichroism]], that is, circular dichroism induced by a magnetic field.

==Circularly polarized luminescence==
''Circularly polarized luminescence'' (CPL) can occur when either a [[luminophore]] or an ensemble of luminophores is [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]. The extent to which emissions are polarized is quantified in the same way it is for [[circular dichroism]], in terms of the ''dissymmetry factor'', also sometimes referred to as the ''[[anisotropy]] factor''. This value is given by

:&lt;math&gt; g_{em} \ =\  2\left ( {\theta_\mathrm{left} - \theta_\mathrm{right} \over \theta_\mathrm{left} + \theta_\mathrm{right} } \right )   &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \theta_\mathrm{left} &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the quantum yield of left-handed circularly polarized light, and &lt;math&gt; \theta_\mathrm{right} &lt;/math&gt; to that of right-handed light. The maximum absolute value of ''g''&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt;, corresponding to purely left- or right-handed circular polarization, is therefore 2. Meanwhile, the smallest absolute value that ''g''&lt;sub&gt;em&lt;/sub&gt; can achieve, corresponding to linearly polarized or unpolarized light, is zero.

==Mathematical description==
The [[Classical physics|classical]] [[Sine wave|sinusoidal]] plane wave solution of the [[electromagnetic wave equation]] for the [[Electric field|electric]] and [[Magnetic field|magnetic]] fields is
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \mathbf{E} ( \mathbf{r}, t ) &amp;= \left| \,\mathbf{E}\, \right| \mathrm{Re} \left\{ \mathbf{Q} \left|\psi\right\rangle \exp \left[ i \left( kz - \omega t \right) \right] \right\} \\
 \mathbf{B} ( \mathbf{r}, t ) &amp;= \hat{ \mathbf{z} } \times \mathbf{E} ( \mathbf{r} , t )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where k is the [[wavenumber]],
:&lt;math&gt; \omega = c k&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[angular frequency]] of the wave, &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{Q} = \left [ \hat{ \mathbf{x}}, \hat{\mathbf{y}} \right ] &lt;/math&gt; is an orthogonal &lt;math&gt; 2 \times 2&lt;/math&gt; matrix whose columns span the transverse x-y plane and &lt;math&gt; c &lt;/math&gt; is the [[speed of light]].

Here
:&lt;math&gt; \left| \,\mathbf{E}\, \right| &lt;/math&gt;

is the [[amplitude]] of the field and
:&lt;math&gt;  |\psi\rangle \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \begin{pmatrix} \psi_x \\ \psi_y  \end{pmatrix} =  \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right )  \\ \sin\theta \exp \left ( i \alpha_y \right )  \end{pmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;

is the normalized [[Jones calculus|Jones vector]] in the x-y plane.

If &lt;math&gt;  \alpha_y  &lt;/math&gt; is rotated by &lt;math&gt;  \pi / 2  &lt;/math&gt; radians with respect to &lt;math&gt;  \alpha_x  &lt;/math&gt; and the x amplitude equals the y amplitude the wave is circularly polarized. The Jones vector is
:&lt;math&gt;  |\psi\rangle = {1\over \sqrt{2}} \begin{pmatrix} 1  \\ \pm i \end{pmatrix} \exp \left ( i \alpha_x \right )  &lt;/math&gt;

where the plus sign indicates left circular polarization and the minus sign indicates right circular polarization. In the case of circular polarization, the electric field vector of constant magnitude rotates in the x-y plane.

If basis vectors are defined such that
:&lt;math&gt;  |R\rangle \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {1\over \sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\ -i \end{pmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;

and
:&lt;math&gt;  |L\rangle \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  {1\over \sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 1  \\ i \end{pmatrix}  &lt;/math&gt;

then the polarization state can be written in the "R-L basis" as
:&lt;math&gt;  |\psi\rangle = \psi_R |R\rangle + \psi_L |L\rangle &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 \psi_R ~&amp;\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}~ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \exp \left( i \delta \right) \right) \exp \left( i \alpha_x \right) \\
 \psi_L ~&amp;\stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}~ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \exp \left( i \delta \right) \right) \exp \left( i \alpha_x \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \delta= \alpha_y - \alpha_x. &lt;/math&gt;

==Antennas==
{{Over-quotation|section|date=April 2018}}
A number of different types of antenna elements can be utilized to produce circularly polarized (or nearly so) radiation; following Balanis,&lt;ref name=Balanis&gt;Balanis, Constantine A. "Antenna Theory – Analysis and Design", 2005, 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; one can use [[Dipole antenna|''dipole elements'']]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"two crossed dipoles provide the two orthogonal field components... If the two dipoles are identical, the field intensity of each along zenith ... would be of the same intensity. Also, if the two dipoles were fed with a 90° degree time-phase difference (phase quadrature), the polarization along zenith would be circular... One way to obtain the 90° time-phase difference between the two orthogonal field components, radiated respectively by the two dipoles, is by feeding one of the two dipoles with a transmission line which is 1/4 wavelength longer or shorter than that of the other", p.80;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
or [[Helical antenna|''helical elements'']]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"To achieve circular polarization [in axial or end-fire mode] ... the circumference ''C'' of the helix must be ... with ''C''/wavelength = 1 near optimum, and the spacing about ''S'' = wavelength/4." p.571;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
or [[Patch antenna#Circular polarization|''patch elements'']]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"circular and elliptical polarizations can be obtained using various feed arrangements or slight modifications made to the elements... Circular polarization can be obtained if two orthogonal modes are excited with a 90° time-phase difference between them. This can be accomplished by adjusting the physical dimensions of the patch ... For a square patch element, the easiest way to excite ideally circular polarization is to feed the element at two adjacent edges ... The quadrature phase difference is obtained by feeding the element with a 90° power divider", p.859.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Quantum mechanics==
In the quantum mechanical view, light is composed of [[photon polarization|photons]]. Polarization is a manifestation of the intrinsic angular momentum (the spin) of the photon. More specifically, in quantum mechanics the direction of spin of a photon is tied to the handedness of the circularly polarized light and the spin of a beam of photons is similar to the spin of a beam of particles, such as electrons.&lt;ref&gt;Introduction to Quantum Theory 2ED David Park Sec 2.2 Pg32 "...the polarization of a beam of light is exactly the same kind of thing as the spin of a beam of electrons, the differences of terminology reflecting only the accidents of the historical order of discovery."&lt;/ref&gt;

==In nature==
[[File:Cetonia-aurata.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Cetonia aurata|rose chafer]]'s external surface reflects almost exclusively left-circularly polarized light.]]

Only a few mechanisms in nature are known to systematically produce circularly polarized [[light]]. In 1911, [[Albert A. Michelson|Albert Abraham Michelson]] discovered that light reflected from the golden scarab beetle ''[[Chrysina resplendens]]'' is preferentially left-polarized. Since then, circular polarization has been measured in several other [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]] like ''[[Chrysina gloriosa]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/sci;325/5939/449 Structural Origin of Circularly Polarized Iridescence in Jeweled Beetles.]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as some [[crustacean]]s such as the [[mantis shrimp]]. In these cases, the underlying mechanism is the molecular-level helicity of the [[chitin]]ous [[cuticle]].&lt;ref name="Hegedüs"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Imaging polarimetry of the circularly polarizing cuticle of scarab beetles (Coleoptera: Rutelidae, Cetoniidae) |author1=Hegedüs, Ramón |author2=Győző Szélb |author3=Gábor Horváth |doi=10.1016/j.visres.2006.02.007 |journal=Vision Research |volume=46 |issue=17 |date=September 2006 |pages=2786–2797 |url=http://arago.elte.hu/new/files/ScarabCircPol_VR-proof-with-colour-figs.pdf |pmid=16564066 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721104604/http://arago.elte.hu/new/files/ScarabCircPol_VR-proof-with-colour-figs.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[bioluminescence]] of the [[larva]]e of [[firefly|fireflie]]s is also circularly polarized, as reported in 1980 for the species ''[[Photuris|Photuris lucicrescens]]'' and ''[[Photuris versicolor]]''. For fireflies, it is more difficult to find a microscopic explanation for the polarization, because the left and right lanterns of the larvae were found to emit polarized light of opposite senses. The authors suggest that the light begins with a [[linear polarization]] due to inhomogeneties inside aligned [[photocyte]]s, and it picks up circular polarization while passing through linearly [[Birefringence|birefringent]] tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Circular polarization observed in bioluminescence |author1=Wynberg, Hans |author2=Meijer, E.W. |author3=Hummelen, J.C. |author4=Dekkers, H.P.J.M. |author5=Schippers, P.H. |author6=Carlson, A.D. |url=http://keur.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/wetenschappers/10/29/29.pdf |journal=Nature |volume=286 |issue=5773 |pages=641–642 |date=7 August 1980 |doi=10.1038/286641a0 |bibcode=1980Natur.286..641W |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724164914/http://keur.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/wetenschappers/10/29/29.pdf |archivedate=24 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Water-air interfaces provide another source of circular polarization. Sunlight that gets scattered back up towards the surface is linearly polarized. If this light is then [[total internal reflection|totally internally reflected]] back down, its vertical component undergoes a phase shift. To an underwater observer looking up, the faint light outside [[Snell's window]] therefore is (partially) circularly polarized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Polarized Light in Animal Vision: Polarization Patterns in Nature |author1=Horváth, Gábor |author2=Dezsö Varjú |year=2003 |publisher=Springer |isbn=3-540-40457-0 |pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weaker sources of circular polarization in nature include multiple scattering by linear polarizers, as in the circular polarization of starlight, and selective absorption by [[circular dichroism|circularly dichroic]] media.

Two species of [[mantis shrimp]] have been reported to be able to detect circular polarized light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Tsyr-Huei Chiou |author2=Sonja Kleinlogel |author3=Tom Cronin |author4=Roy Caldwell |author5=Birte Loeffler |author6=Afsheen Siddiqi |author7=Alan Goldizen |author8=Justin Marshall |title=Circular polarization vision in a stomatopod crustacean |journal=[[Current Biology]] |year=2008 |volume=18 |issue=6 |pages=429–34 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2008.02.066 |pmid=18356053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleinlogel et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sonja Kleinlogel |author2=Andrew White |title=The secret world of shrimps: polarisation vision at its best |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |year=2008 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002190 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=e2190 |url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002190 |pmid=18478095 |pmc=2377063 |bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.2190K|arxiv = 0804.2162 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Starlight==
The '''circular polarization of starlight''' has been observed to be a function of the linear [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of [[starlight]].

Starlight becomes partially linearly polarized by scattering from elongated [[Cosmic dust|interstellar dust]] grains whose long axes tend to be oriented perpendicular to the galactic [[magnetic field]]. According to the [[Polarization in astronomy|Davis–Greenstein mechanism]], the grains spin rapidly with their rotation axis along the magnetic field. Light polarized along the direction of the magnetic field [[perpendicular]] to the line of sight is transmitted, while light polarized in the plane defined by the rotating grain is blocked. Thus the polarization direction can be used to map the [[Galactic magnetic fields|galactic magnetic field]]. The degree of polarization is on the order of 1.5% for stars at 1,000 [[parsec]]s' distance.&lt;ref name="Fosalba 2002"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Fosalba| year= 2002| journal= Astrophysical Journal| volume= 564| pages= 722 | doi = 10.1086/324297| title=Statistical Properties of Galactic Starlight Polarization| first1=Pablo| last2=Lazarian| first2=Alex| last3=Prunet| first3=Simon| last4=Tauber| first4=Jan A.| bibcode=2002ApJ...564..762F|arxiv = astro-ph/0105023| issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, a much smaller fraction of circular polarization is found in starlight. Serkowski, Mathewson and Ford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Serkowski|author2=Mathewson and Ford| year=1975| journal= Astrophysical Journal| volume= 196| pages= 261
 | doi = 10.1086/153410| title=Wavelength dependence of interstellar polarization and ratio of total to selective extinction| first1=K.| bibcode=1975ApJ...196..261S}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured the polarization of 180 stars in UBVR filters. They found a maximum fractional circular polarization of &lt;math&gt;q = 6 \times 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;, in the R filter.

The explanation is that the interstellar medium is optically thin. Starlight traveling through a kiloparsec column undergoes about a magnitude of extinction, so that the optical depth ~ 1. An optical depth of 1 corresponds to a mean free path, which is the distance, on average that a photon travels before scattering from a dust grain. So on average, a starlight photon is scattered from a single interstellar grain; multiple scattering (which produces circular polarization) is much less likely. Observationally,&lt;ref name="Fosalba 2002"/&gt; the linear polarization fraction p ~ 0.015 from a single scattering; circular polarization from multiple scattering goes as &lt;math&gt;p^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, so we expect a circularly polarized fraction of &lt;math&gt;q \sim 2 \times 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;.

Light from early-type stars has very little intrinsic polarization. Kemp et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kemp| year= 1987| journal= Nature| volume= 326| pages= 270 | doi = 10.1038/326270a0| title=The optical polarization of the Sun measured at a sensitivity of parts in ten million| first1=J. C.|bibcode = 1987Natur.326..270K| issue=6110|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured the optical polarization of the Sun at sensitivity of &lt;math&gt;3 \times 10^{-7}&lt;/math&gt;; they found upper limits of &lt;math&gt;10^{-6}&lt;/math&gt; for both &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (fraction of linear polarization) and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; (fraction of circular polarization).

The interstellar medium can produce circularly polarized (CP) light from unpolarized light by sequential scattering from elongated interstellar grains aligned in different directions. One possibility is twisted grain alignment along the line of sight due to variation in the galactic magnetic field; another is the line of sight passes through multiple clouds. For these mechanisms the maximum expected CP fraction is &lt;math&gt;q \sim p^{2}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the fraction of linearly polarized (LP) light. Kemp &amp; Wolstencroft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Kemp|author2=Wolstencroft| year=1972| journal= Astrophysical Journal| volume= 176| pages= L115 | doi = 10.1086/181036| title=Interstellar Circular Polarization: Data for Six Stars and the Wavelength Dependence| first1=James C.| bibcode=1972ApJ...176L.115K}}&lt;/ref&gt; found CP in six early-type stars (no intrinsic polarization), which they were able to attribute to the first mechanism mentioned above. In all cases, &lt;math&gt;q \sim 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt; in blue light.

Martin&lt;ref name="martin72"&gt;{{cite journal| last=Martin| year=1972| journal= MNRAS| volume= 159| pages= 179|bibcode = 1972MNRAS.159..179M| title=Interstellar circular polarization| doi=10.1093/mnras/159.2.179}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the interstellar medium can convert LP light to CP by scattering from partially aligned interstellar grains having a complex index of refraction. This effect was observed for light from the [[Crab Nebula]] by Martin, Illing and Angel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| year=1972| last=Martin |first=P.G. |journal= MNRAS| volume= 159| pages=191|bibcode = 1972MNRAS.159..191M| title=Discovery of interstellar circular polarization in the direction of the Crab nebula |last2=Illing |first2=R. |last3=Angel |first3=J. R. P. | doi=10.1093/mnras/159.2.191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An optically thick circumstellar environment can potentially produce much larger CP than the interstellar medium. Martin&lt;ref name="martin72" /&gt; suggested that LP light can become CP near a star by multiple scattering in an optically thick asymmetric circumstellar dust cloud. This mechanism was invoked by Bastien, Robert and Nadeau,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Bastein|author2=Robert and Nadeau| year=1989| journal= Astrophysical Journal| volume=339| pages=1089| doi=10.1086/167363| title=Circular polarization in T Tauri stars. II - New observations and evidence for multiple scattering| first1=Pierre| bibcode=1989ApJ...339.1089B}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explain the CP measured in 6 T-Tauri stars at a wavelength of 768&amp;nbsp;nm. They found a maximum CP of &lt;math&gt;q \sim 7 \times 10^{-4}&lt;/math&gt;. Serkowski&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Serkowski| year=1973| journal= Astrophysical Journal| volume= 179| pages= L101 | doi = 10.1086/181126| title=Infrared Circular Polarization of NML Cygni and VY Canis Majoris| first1=K.| bibcode=1973ApJ...179L.101S}}&lt;/ref&gt; measured CP of &lt;math&gt;q = 7 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; for the red supergiant [[NML Cygni]] and &lt;math&gt;q = 2 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt; in the long-period variable M star VY [[Canis Major]]is in the H band, ascribing the CP to multiple scattering in [[circumstellar envelope]]s. Chrysostomou et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Chrysostomou| year= 2000| journal= MNRAS| volume= 312| pages= 103 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-8711.2000.03126.x| title=Polarimetry of young stellar objects - III.

Circular polarization of zodiacal light and [[Milky Way]] diffuse galactic light was measured at wavelength of 550&amp;nbsp;nm by Wolstencroft and Kemp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wolstencroft|author2=Kemp| year=1972| journal= Astrophysical Journal| volume= 177| pages= L137 | doi = 10.1086/181068| title=Circular Polarization of the Nightsky Radiation| first1=Ramon D.| bibcode=1972ApJ...177L.137W}}&lt;/ref&gt; They found values of &lt;math&gt;q \sim 5 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;, which is higher than for ordinary stars, presumably because of multiple scattering from dust grains.

Before the fertilized [[ovum]] reaches the [[uterus]], the [[mucous membrane]] of the body of the uterus undergoes important changes and is then known as the [[decidua]]. The thickness and vascularity of the mucous membrane are greatly increased; its glands are elongated and open on its free surface by funnel-shaped [[orifices]], while their deeper portions are tortuous and dilated into irregular spaces. The interglandular tissue is also increased in quantity, and is crowded with large round, oval, or polygonal cells, termed '''decidual cells'''.  Their enlargement is due to glycogen and lipid accumulation in the cytoplasm allowing these cells to provide a rich source of nutrition for the developing embryo.

Experimentally, human endometrial stromal cells can be decidualized in culture by using analogs of [[Cyclic AMP|cAMP]] and [[progesterone]]. The cells will exhibit a decidualized phenotype and display upregulation of common [[decidualization]] markers such as [[prolactin]] and [[IGFBP1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gellersen|first=Birgit|last2=Brosens|first2=Ivo|last3=Brosens|first3=Jan|date=2007-11-01|title=Decidualization of the Human Endometrium: Mechanisms, Functions, and Clinical Perspectives|url=http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.1055/s-2007-991042|journal=Seminars in Reproductive Medicine|language=en|volume=25|issue=6|pages=445–453|doi=10.1055/s-2007-991042|issn=1526-8004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

{{Literature}}
An '''epic poem''', '''epic''', '''epos''', or '''epopee'''  is a lengthy [[narrative poem]], ordinarily involving a time beyond living memory in which occurred the extraordinary doings of the extraordinary men and women who, in dealings with the gods or other superhuman forces, gave shape to the moral universe that their descendants, the poet and his audience, must understand to understand themselves as a people or nation.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Meyer, ''The Bedford Introduction to Literature'' (Bedford: St. Martin's, 2005), 2128. {{ISBN|0312412428}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of epic poetry is [[epyllion]] (plural: epyllia), which is a brief narrative poem with a [[romanticism|romantic]] or [[Mythology|mythological]] [[Theme (literature)|theme]]. The term, which means "little [[:wikt:epic|epic]]", came into use in the nineteenth century. It refers primarily to the erudite, shorter hexameter poems of the [[Hellenistic poetry|Hellenistic period]] and the similar works composed at Rome from the age of the [[neoteric]]s; to a lesser degree, the term includes some poems of the [[English Renaissance]], particularly those influenced by [[Ovid]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The most famous example of [[Classical antiquity|classical]] epyllion is perhaps [[Catullus 64]].

==Etymology==
The English word ''epic'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''epicus'', which itself comes from the [[Ancient Greek]] adjective {{lang|grc|ἐπικός}} (''epikos''), from {{lang|grc|ἔπος}} (''epos''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite OED | epic | id=63237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "word, story, poem".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=epic Epic] Online Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Originating before the invention of writing, primary epics were composed by bards who used complex rhetorical and metrical schemes by which they could memorize the epic as received in tradition and add to the epic in their performances. Hence aside from writers like Dante, Camões, and Milton, [[Apollonius of Rhodes]] in his ''[[Argonautica]]'' and Virgil in ''[[Aeneid]]'' adopted and adapted [[Homer]]'s [[Parallels between Virgil's Aeneid and Homer's Iliad and Odyssey|style and subject matter]], but used devices available only to those who write, and in their works [[Nonnus|Nonnus' ''Dionysiaca'']] and [[Tulsidas]]' ''[[Sri Ramacharit Manas]]'' also used stylistic elements typical of epics.

The oldest epic recognized is the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' ({{circa|2500–1300 BCE}}), which was recorded In ancient [[Sumer]] during the [[Neo-Sumerian Empire]]. The poem details the exploits of [[Gilgamesh]], the king of [[Uruk]]. Although recognized as a historical figure, Gilgamesh, as represented in the epic, is a largely legendary or mythical figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Lawall |editor1-first=Sarah N. |editor2-last=Mack |editor2-first=Maynard |date=1999 |title=Norton Anthology of World Masterpieces: The Western Tradition |volume=1 |edition=7 |url= |location=New York |publisher=W.W.

The longest epic written is the ancient Indian ''[[Mahabharata]]'', which consists of 100,000 [[śloka]]s or over 200,000 verse lines (each shloka is a couplet), as well as long prose passages, so that at about 1.8 million words it is about four times the length of the ''[[Rāmāyaṇa]]'', and roughly ten times the length of the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'' combined.&lt;ref name="Lochtefeld2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=James G.

Famous examples of epic poetry include the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',  the ancient Indian ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and ''[[Rāmāyaṇa]]'', the Tamil ''[[Silappatikaram]]'', the Persian ''[[Shahnameh]]'', the Ancient Greek ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]'', [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'',  the Old English ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'',  the Finnish ''[[Kalevala]]'', the German ''[[Nibelungenlied]]'', the French ''[[Song of Roland]]'', the Spanish ''[[Cantar de mio Cid]]'', Camões' [[Os Lusíadas|Os ''Lusíadas'']], [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', and Adam Mickiewicz's ''[[Pan Tadeusz]]''.

==Oral epics==
The first epics were products of [[literacy|preliterate]] [[societies]] and [[oral history]] poetic traditions.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} [[Oral tradition]] was used alongside written scriptures to communicate and facilitate the spread culture.&lt;ref name="Goody1987p82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Goody |title=The Interface Between the Written and the Oral  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TepXQMN6lfUC |year=1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press  |isbn=978-0521337946 |pages=110–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these traditions, poetry is transmitted to the audience and from performer to performer by purely oral means. Early twentieth-century study of living oral epic traditions in the [[Balkans]] by [[Milman Parry]] and Albert Lord demonstrated the [[Parataxis|paratactic]] model used for composing these poems. What they demonstrated was that oral epics tend to be constructed in short episodes, each of equal status, interest and importance. This facilitates memorization, as the poet is recalling each episode in turn and using the completed episodes to recreate the entire epic as he performs it. Parry and Lord also contend that the most likely source for written texts of the epics of [[Homer]] was dictation from an oral performance.

[[Milman Parry]] and [[Albert Lord]] have argued that the Homeric epics, the earliest works of Western literature, were fundamentally an oral poetic form. These works form the basis of the epic genre in Western literature. Nearly all of Western epic (including Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' and Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy]]'') self-consciously presents itself as a continuation of the tradition begun by these poems. Classical epic poetry employs a meter called [[dactylic hexameter]] and recounts a journey, either physical (as typified by Odysseus in the ''[[Odyssey]]'') or mental (as typified by Achilles in the ''[[Iliad]]'') or both. Epics also tend to highlight cultural norms and to define or call into question cultural values, particularly as they pertain to [[heroism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===Composition and conventions===

In his work ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Aristotle defines an epic as one of the forms of poetry, contrasted with [[lyric poetry]] and with drama in the form of tragedy and comedy.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristotle: Poetics'', translated with an introduction and notes by M. Heath, (Penguin) London 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''A Handbook to Literature'' (1999), Harmon and Holman define an epic:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Epic: a long narrative poem in elevated style presenting characters of high position in adventures forming an organic whole through their relation to a central heroic figure and through their development of episodes important to the history of a nation or race. (Harmon and Holman)&lt;ref name="Harmon and Harmon"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An attempt to delineate ten main characteristics of an epic:&lt;ref name="Harmon and Harmon"&gt;Taken from William Harmon and C. Hugh Holman, A Handbook to Literature, 8th ed., Prentice Hall, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Begins [[in medias res]].
# The setting is vast, covering many nations, the world or the universe.
# Begins with an invocation to a [[muse]] (epic invocation).
# Begins with a statement of the theme.
# Includes the use of [[epithets]].
# Contains long lists, called an [[epic catalogue]].
# Features long and formal speeches.
# Shows divine intervention on human affairs.
# Features heroes that embody the values of the civilization.
# Often features the tragic hero's descent into the [[underworld]] or [[hell]].

The hero generally participates in a cyclical journey or quest, faces adversaries that try to defeat him in his journey and returns home significantly transformed by his journey. The epic hero illustrates [[Characteristics of Epic Heroes|traits]], performs deeds, and exemplifies certain morals that are valued by the society the epic originates from. Many epic heroes are [[recurring character]]s in the legends of their native culture.

Conventions of epics:{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''Proposition'': Opens by stating the theme or cause of the epic. This may take the form of a purpose (as in Milton, who proposed "to justify the ways of God to men"); of a question (as in the ''[[Iliad]]'', which [[Homer]] initiates by asking a Muse to sing of Achilles' anger); or of a situation (as in the ''[[The Song of Roland|Song of Roland]]'', with [[Charlemagne]] in Spain).{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}
# ''[[Invocation]]'': Writer invokes a [[Muse]], one of the nine daughters of [[Zeus]]. The poet prays to the Muses to provide him with divine inspiration to tell the story of a great hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battles|first=Paul|date=2014|title=Toward a Theory of Old English Poetic Genres: Epic, Elegy, Wisdom Poetry, and the "Traditional Opening"|url=|journal=Studies in Philosophy|volume=111,1|pages=1–34|doi=10.1353/sip.2014.0001|via=Project MUSE}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This convention is restricted to cultures influenced by European Classical culture. The ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', for example, or the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' do not contain this element.)
# ''[[In medias res]]'': narrative opens "in the middle of things", with the hero at his lowest point. Usually flashbacks show earlier portions of the story.
# ''[[Enumeratio]]'': Catalogues and genealogies are given. These long lists of objects, places, and people place the finite action of the epic within a broader, universal context. Often, the poet is also paying homage to the ancestors of audience members.
# ''[[Epithet]]'': Heavy use of repetition or stock phrases: e.g., [[Epithets in Homer|Homer]]'s "rosy-fingered dawn" and "wine-dark sea".

== Form ==
Many verse forms have been used in epic poems through the ages, but each language's literature typically gravitates to one form, or at least to a very limited set. Ancient Sumerian epic poems did not use any kind of [[Meter (poetry)|poetic meter]] and [[Line (poetry)|lines]] did not have consistent lengths;&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"&gt;{{citation|last=Kramer|first=Samuel Noah|author-link=Samuel Noah Kramer|title=The Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character|date=1963|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0226452388|pages=184–185|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, Sumerian poems derived their rhythm solely through constant [[Repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], with subtle variations between lines.&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"/&gt; [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] epic poetry, by contrast, usually places strong emphasis on the importance of line consistency and poetic meter.&lt;ref name="Kramer1963"/&gt; Ancient Greek and Latin poems were written in dactylic [[hexameter]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/hexameter Hexameter, poetry at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; Old English, German and Norse poems were written in [[alliterative verse]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/alliterative-verse Alliterative verse literature at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; usually without [[rhyme]]. Italian, Spanish and Portuguese long poems were usually written in [[terza rima]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/terza-rima Terza rima, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; or especially [[ottava rima]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/ottava-rima Ottava rima, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; From the 14th century English epic poems were written in [[heroic couplet]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/heroic-couplet Heroic couplet, poetry at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[rhyme royal]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/rhyme-royal Rhyme royal, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; though in the 16th century the [[Spenserian stanza]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/Spenserian-stanza Spenserian stanza, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[blank verse]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/art/blank-verse  Blank verse, poetic form at Encyclopædia Britannica.]&lt;/ref&gt; were also introduced. The [[French alexandrine]] is currently the heroic line in French literature, though in earlier periods the [[decasyllable]] took precedence. In Polish literature, couplets of [[Polish alexandrine]]s (syllabic lines of 7+6 syllables) prevail.&lt;ref&gt;See: Trzynastozgłoskowiec, [in:] Wiktor Jarosław Darasz, Mały przewodnik po wierszu polskim, Kraków 2003 (in Polish).&lt;/ref&gt; In Russian, [[iambic tetrameter]] verse is the most popular.&lt;ref&gt;[Alexandra Smith, Montaging Pushkin: Pushkin and Visions of Modernity in Russian Twentieth Century Poetry, p. 184.]&lt;/ref&gt; In Serbian poetry, the decasyllable is the only form employed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.pl/books?id=6qTpBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=serbian+decasyllable&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MktD0VfvNW&amp;sig=E-2QFetJSwJHIDDl_ADj3mAK7i0&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidq_a-ztjQAhWBXCwKHd9HAJkQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=serbian%20decasyllable&amp;f=falseDavid Meyer, Early Tahitian Poetics.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebritic.com/?p=146369  Robert William Seton-Watson, The Spirit of the Serb.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Etymologicum Genuinum''''' (standard abbreviation '''''E Gen''''') is the conventional modern title given to a [[Lexicography|lexical]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] in the mid ninth century. The anonymous compiler drew on the works of numerous earlier lexicographers and [[scholiasts]], both ancient and recent, including [[Aelius Herodianus]], [[Georgius Choeroboscus]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], [[Orion of Thebes]], [[Oros of Alexandria]] and  [[Theognostus the Grammarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 1-69; Alpers (1969) 3-24; Alpers (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' was possibly a product of the intellectual circle around [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. It was an important source for the subsequent Byzantine lexicographical tradition, including the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'', ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]'' and ''[[Etymologicum Symeonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1972); Rance (2007) 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship discovered the ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' only in the nineteenth century. It is preserved in two tenth-century [[manuscripts]], ''Codex Vaticanus Graecus'' 1818 (= A) and ''Codex Laurentianus Sancti Marci'' 304 (= B; AD 994). Neither contains the earliest [[recension]] nor the complete text, but rather two different abridgements. The manuscript evidence and citations in later works suggest that the original title was simply τὸ Ἐτυμολογικόν and later τὸ μέγα Ἐτυμολογικόν. Its modern name was coined in 1897 by [[Richard Reitzenstein]], who was the first to edit a sample section.&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 11-44&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' remains for the most part unpublished except for specimen glosses.&lt;ref&gt;Colonna (1967); Alpers (1969); Berger (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Two editions are in long-term preparation, one begun by [[Ada Adler]] and continued by [[Klaus Alpers]],&lt;ref&gt;Alpers (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the other by [[François Lasserre]] and [[Nikolaos Livadaras]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasserre and Livadaras (1976- )&lt;/ref&gt; The latter edition is published under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum'', but this designation is not widely used and is a potential source of confusion with the twelfth-century lexical compendium conventionally titled the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.

An '''evolutionary landscape''' is a metaphor,&lt;ref name=Wright1932&gt;Wright, Sewall (1932) The Roles of Mutation, Inbreeding, Crossbreeding, and Selection in Evolution. ''Proceedings of the Sixth International Congress of Genetics'' 1: 356-366&lt;/ref&gt; a construct used to think about and visualize the processes of [[evolution]] (e.g. [[natural selection]] and [[genetic drift]]) acting on a biological entity&lt;ref name=Wright1988&gt;Wright, Sewall (1988) Surfaces of Selective Value Revisited. ''The American Naturalist'' 131(1):115-123&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., a [[gene]], [[protein]], [[population]], [[species]]).&lt;ref name=Lee2008&gt;Lee, Carol E. &amp; Gelebiuk, Gregory W. (2008) Evolutionary origins of invasive populations. "Evolutionary Applications" 1: 427-448.&lt;/ref&gt; This entity can be viewed as searching or moving through a search space. For example, the search space of a gene would be all possible nucleotide sequences. The search space is only part of an evolutionary landscape. The final component is the "y-axis," which is usually [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]]. Each value along the search space can result in a high or low fitness for the entity.&lt;ref name=Wright1932 /&gt; If small movements through search space cause changes in fitness that are relatively small, then the landscape is considered smooth. Smooth landscapes happen when most fixed mutations have little to no effect on fitness, which is what one would expect with [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|the neutral theory of molecular evolution]]. In contrast, if small movements result in large changes in fitness, then the landscape is said to be rugged.&lt;ref name=Wright1932 /&gt; In either case, movement tends to be toward areas of higher fitness, though usually not the global optima.

What exactly constitutes an "evolutionary landscape" is confused in the literature. The term 'evolutionary landscape' is often used interchangeably with 'adaptive landscape' and 'fitness landscape', although some authors distinguish between these terms. As discussed below, different authors have different definitions of adaptive and fitness landscapes. Additionally, there is a large disagreement whether evolutionary landscape should be used as a visual metaphor disconnected from the underlying math, a tool for evaluating models of evolution, or a model in and of itself used to generate hypotheses and predictions.

== History ==

===Pre-Wright===

According to McCoy (1979), the first evolutionary landscape was presented by Armand Janet of Toulon, France in 1895.&lt;ref name=McCoy1979&gt;McCoy J. Wynne. 1979. The Origin of the "Adaptive Landscape" Concept. The American Naturalist 113(4):610-613.&lt;/ref&gt; In Janet's evolutionary landscape, a species is represented as a point or an area on a polydimensional surface of phenotypes, which is reduced to two dimensions for simplicity. The size of the population is proportional to the amount of variation within the population.&lt;ref name=Dietrich2012&gt;Dietrich MR &amp; Skipper RA. 2012 "A Shifting Terrain: A Brief History of the Adaptive Landscape." In: The Adaptive Landscape in Evolutionary Biology. eds. Erik Svensson &amp; Ryan Calsbeek Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Natural selection (the influence of the exterior features) is represented by a vector. Unlike the evolutionary landscapes of those who would follow, in Janet's concept, natural selection pulls species toward the minima instead of the maxima. This is because the y-axis doesn't represent fitness but stability.&lt;ref name=McCoy1979 /&gt; One important aspect of Janet's evolutionary landscape (versus Wright's) is that the landscape changes as the environment changes.&lt;ref name=Dietrich2012 /&gt;

===Wrightian Landscapes===

Credit for the first evolutionary landscape typically goes to [[Sewall Wright]], and his idea has arguably had a much larger audience and greater influence on the field of evolutionary biology.&lt;ref name=Dietrich2012 /&gt; In his 1932 paper, Wright presents the concept of an evolutionary landscape composed of a polydimensional array of gene ([[allele]]) or genotype frequencies and an axis of fitness, which served as a visual metaphor to explain his [[shifting balance theory]]. Similarly to Janet, Wright felt the landscape could be reduced to two dimensions for simplicity. (This is one of the greatest criticisms, which are discussed below.) Populations are represented by areas, with the size of the area corresponding to the amount of genetic diversity within the population. Natural selection drives populations toward maxima, while drift represents wandering and could potentially cause a peak shift. Movement across the landscape represented changes in gene frequencies.&lt;ref name=Wright1932 /&gt; This landscape was represented as a series of contour lines, much like a topological map; while selection kept or moved a biological entity to a peak, genetic drift allowed different peaks to be explored.&lt;ref name=Wright1932 /&gt;

In 1944, Simpson expanded Wright's landscape to include phenotypes.&lt;ref name =Simpson1944&gt;Simpson, GG. 1944. ''Tempo and Mode in Evolution'' Columbia University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; in Simpson's model, the landscape was a means of visualizing the "relationship between selection, structure, and adaptation." &lt;ref name=Dietrich2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Simpson1944 /&gt; Unlike Wright, Simpson used the landscape to represent both natural selection and genetic drift. Uphill movements are due to [[positive selection]], and downhill movements are due to [[negative selection (natural selection)|negative selection]]. The size and shape of a peak indicated the relative specificity of selection; i.e. a sharp and high peak indicates highly specific selection. Another difference between Simpson's and Wright's landscapes is the level at which evolution is acting. For Wright, a [[population geneticist]], only populations of a species were shown. In Simpson's figures, the circles drawn represent all of Equidae.&lt;ref name=Simpson1944 /&gt; The most important difference is that in Simpson's model, the landscape could vary through time, while in Wright's model, the landscape was static. Wright reviewed Simpson's work (''Tempo and Mode in Evolution'') and did not object to Simpson's use of evolutionary landscapes.&lt;ref name=Dietrich2012 /&gt; In later writings, Simpson referred to peaks as adaptive zones.&lt;ref name=Lande1976&gt;Lande, R. (1976) Natural selection and random genetic drift in phenotypic evolution. Evolution 30: 314-334.&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of papers [[Russell Lande]] developed a mathematical model for Simpson's phenotypic landscape.&lt;ref name=Lande1976 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Lande1979&gt;Lande, R. (1979) Effective Deme Sizes During Long-Term Evolution Estimated from Rates of Chromosomal Rearrangement. Evolution 33:234-251&lt;/ref&gt; Lande reconciled Wright's population level view with Simpson's use of higher taxonomic levels.&lt;ref name=Lande1976 /&gt; Lande considers fitness peaks to be determined by the environment and thus represent ecological niches or adaptive zones for a population. Clusters of peaks inhabited by phenotypically similar populations can be viewed as higher taxonomic levels.&lt;ref name=Lande1976 /&gt;

===Molecular Era===

The concept of evolutionary landscapes changed once more as we entered the era of molecular evolution. It is claimed Maynard Smith (1970) is the first to visualize protein evolution as a network of proteins one mutational step away from others.&lt;ref name=Dietrich2012 /&gt; However, for this to be true, there must be pathways between functional proteins. Acknowledging the work of Kimura, King, and Jukes ([[Neutral theory of molecular evolution|the neutral theory of molecular evolution]]), Maynard Smith realized the proteins along such pathways could have equal functionality or be neutral. In other words, not all moves in evolution are "uphill." &lt;ref name=Dietrich2012 /&gt; In 1984, Gillespie adapted the concept of evolutionary landscapes to nucleotide sequences and so visualized the "mutational landscape" whereby all nucleotide sequences are one mutational step away from another,&lt;ref name=Dietrich2012 /&gt; which is remarkably similar and yet fundamentally different from Wright's original concept. This conceptual shift, along with the development of vast computational power, has allowed evolutionary landscapes to move from being a simple visual metaphor to a working model of evolution. As one might expect, this has drawn heavy criticism and generated much research.&lt;ref name=Adaptive2012&gt;The Adaptive Landscape in Evolutionary Biology. Eds. Erik Svensson &amp; Ryan Calsbeek. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EvoLandscape1.png|thumb|Hypothetical evolutionary landscape. The horizontal axes represent the biological parameters being measures (i.e. component of phenotype, genotype, nucleotide sequence combinations) and the vertical axis represents fitness. This particular example is a typical evolutionary landscape with peaks (lighter areas) and valleys (darker areas) generated from a shuffled dataset concerning the lichen Physcia millegrana.]]

== Criticisms ==
One of the first criticisms (or at least difficulty) with evolutionary landscapes is their dimensionality. Wright recognized that true landscapes can have thousands of dimensions, but he also felt reducing those dimensions to two was acceptable since his point in doing so was to simply convey a complex idea.&lt;ref name=Wright1932 /&gt; As a visual metaphor, this might be a valid reduction; however, the work of Gavrilets has shown that taking the high dimensionality of evolutionary landscapes into consideration may matter.&lt;ref name=Kaplan2008 /&gt; In a high-dimensional framework, the peaks and valleys disappear and are replaced with hypervolume areas of high fitness and low fitness, which can be visualized as curved surfaces and holes in a 3-D landscape.&lt;ref name=Kaplan2008 /&gt; While this does not affect visualization of the landscape per se (i.e. holes are equivalent to valleys), it does affect the underlying mathematical model and the predicted outcomes.[[File:EvoLandscape2.png|thumb|Hypothetical evolutionary landscape. The horizontal axes represent the biological parameters being measured (i.e. component of phenotype, genotype, nucleotide sequence combinations) and the vertical axis represents fitness. This particular landscape is an exaggerated example of Gavrilet's holey landscape.]]

The work of Gavrilets, along with other issues, has prompted Kaplan (2008) to propose abandoning the metaphor of evolutionary landscapes (which he calls adaptive or fitness landscapes).&lt;ref name=Kaplan2008 /&gt; Kaplan (2008) has 6 main criticisms of the metaphor: (1) it has no explanatory power, (2) its lacks a relevant mathematical model, (3) it has no heuristic role, (4) it is imprecise, (5) it confuses more than it explains, (6) and there is no longer a reason to keep thinking in 2D or 3D when we have the computational power to consider higher dimensionality. Others feel Kaplan's criticisms are not warranted because he (and others) want evolutionary landscapes to meet the standards of a mathematical model; however, the landscape metaphor is just that, a metaphor. It has heuristic value as a metaphorical tool allowing one to visualize and evaluate the common core of assumptions in an evolutionary model.&lt;ref name=Skipper2012&gt;Skipper RA &amp; Dietrich MR. 2012 "Sewall Wright's adaptive landscape: Philosophical reflections on heuristic value." In: The Adaptive Landscape in Evolutionary Biology. eds. Erik Svensson &amp; Ryan Calsbeek Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While Kaplan (2008) wishes to discard the idea of landscapes all together, [[Massimo Pigliucci]] is less drastic. He acknowledges four categories of landscapes: fitness landscapes, adaptive landscapes, fitness surfaces, and morphospaces. Fitness landscapes are those similar to what Wright (1932) proposed (called an adaptive and fitness landscapes below). Adaptive landscapes are the phenotypic landscapes proposed by Simpson (1944), and fitness surfaces are the phenotypic landscapes with Lande's mathematical models applied to them. Morphospaces, pioneered by Raup (1966), are phenotypic landscapes developed ''a priori'' using mathematical models onto which observed measurements are mapped. They lack a fitness axis, and are used to show the occupied areas within the potential phenotypic space. [[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci]] suggests we abandon Wrightian fitness landscapes. Adaptive landscapes and fitness surfaces can be used with caution, i.e. with the understanding they are not phenotypic versions of Wright's original concept and that they are fraught with potentially misleading assumptions. Finally, [[Massimo Pigliucci|Pigliucci]] calls for further research into morphospaces due to their heuristic value but also their ability to generate understandable and testable hypotheses.&lt;ref name=Pigliucci2012 /&gt;

== Types of Evolutionary Landscapes ==

===Adaptive Landscapes===
Adaptive landscapes represent populations (of biological entities) as a single point, and the axes correspond to frequencies of [[alleles]] or [[genotypes]] and the mean population fitness.&lt;ref name=Wright1932 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaplan2008&gt;Kaplan J. (2008) The end of the adaptive landscape metaphor? ''Bio Philos'' 23:625-638&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Visualization of two dimensions of a NK fitness landscape.png|thumb|Visualization of two dimensions of a NK fitness landscape. The arrows represent various mutational paths that the population could follow while evolving on the fitness landscape.]]

===Fitness Landscapes===
[[Fitness landscape]]s represent populations (of biological entities) as clusters of points with each point representing a unique genotype. The axes correspond to the loci of those genotypes and the resulting mean population fitness.&lt;ref name=Kaplan2008 /&gt;

===Phenotypic Landscape===
Phenotypic landscapes represent populations of species as clusters of points with each point representing a [[phenotype]]. The axes correspond to frequencies of phenotypes and the mean population fitness.&lt;ref name=Kaplan2008 /&gt; See the visualizations below for examples of phenotypic landscapes.

[[File:Visualization of a population evolving in a static fitness landscape.gif|Visualization of a population evolving in a static evolutionary landscape]]

[[File:Visualization of a population evolving in a dynamic fitness landscape.gif|Visualization of a population evolving in a dynamic evolutionary landscape]]

===Selection-weighted attraction graphing===
Selection-weighted attraction graphing (SWAG) uses force-directed network graphing to visualize fitness landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Barrett|last2=Ostermeier|first2=Marc|date=2016-01-01|title=Environmental changes bridge evolutionary valleys|url=http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/1/e1500921|journal=Science Advances|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=e1500921|doi=10.1126/sciadv.1500921|issn=2375-2548|pmc=4737206|pmid=26844293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this visualization, genotypes are represented by nodes which are attracted to each other in proportion to the relative change in fitness between them (nodes will tend to be closer if there is stronger selection strength between them on average). Additionally, fitness values may be assigned to the z-axis to create an empirical three-dimensional model of the landscape and depict fitness peaks and valleys. Clusters in this depiction may represent local fitness peaks. 


===Phenotypic Plasticity Landscape===
Phenotypic plasticity landscapes depart from the other landscapes in that it does not use the mean population fitness. Instead, that axis represents [[Character (biology)|characters (phenotypic traits)]] and other axes represent the underlying factors affecting the character.&lt;ref name=Kaplan2008 /&gt;

===Epigenetic Landscape===
[[Epigenetic]] landscapes are "used to describe modal developmental tendency and major deviations" with a "space of abstract variables." &lt;ref name=Kaplan2008 /&gt;

===Morphospaces===
Morphospaces also lack a dimension of fitness. Instead, their axes are mathematical models of phenotypic traits developed ''a priori'' to observational measurements. Observational measurements are then mapped onto the resulting surface to indicate areas of possible phenotypic space occupied by the species under consideration. .&lt;ref name=Pigliucci2012&gt;Pigliucci M 2012. "Landscapes, surfaces, and morphospaces: What are they good for?" In: The Adaptive Landscape in Evolutionary Biology. eds. Erik Svensson &amp; Ryan Calsbeek Oxford Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications to Genomics ==

The increase of computational power and ease of sequencing has allowed the concept of evolutionary landscapes to be taken from a purely conceptual metaphor to something that can be modeled and explored. This is especially true of the field of [[genomics]]. One good example is the research article "The Evolutionary Landscape of Cytosolic Microbial Sensors in Humans." &lt;ref name=Vasseur2012&gt;Vasseur E, M Boniotto, E Patin, G Laval, H Quach, J Manry, B Crouau-Roy, &amp; L Quintana-Murci. 2012. The Evolutionary Landscape of Cytosolic Microbial Sensors in Humans. The American Journal of Human Genetics 91:27-37.&lt;/ref&gt; In their study, Vasseur et al. were interested in the evolution of the [[innate immune system]]; specifically, they wished to map the genetic diversity—the occupied evolutionary landscape—and patterns of selection and diversification—the movements made and being made along that landscape—of the [[NOD-like receptor|nod-like receptor (NLRs) family]] of the [[Pattern recognition receptor|pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs)]] that drive the innate immune response. These genes are responsible for detecting patterns/chemicals (e.g. [[chitin]], [[oxidative stress]]) associated with invading [[microbes]], tissue damage, and stress. To achieve this, they sequenced 21 genes from 185 humans and used several statistical methods to examine patterns of selection and diversification. The NLR family can be divided into two sub-families—the NALP subfamily and the NOD/IPAF sub-family. The authors found that the NALP family was under strong [[purifying selection]] and exhibited low genetic and functional diversity. They hypothesize this is because these genes have vital, non-redundant roles. Evidence in favor of this hypothesis comes from the independent discovery of rare alleles with mutations in two of the genes leading to a severe inflammatory disease and pregnancy complications. The NOD/IPAF family seems to have evolved under relaxed selection and exhibits a fair amount of genetic and functional diversity.  The authors also found evidence of [[positive selection]]. The gene with the strongest positive selection was NLRP1, which has two [[haplotypes]] undergoing [[selective sweeps]]. The first haplotype is seven [[amino acids]] in strong [[linkage disequilibrium]]. This haplotype is global and seems to be moving toward fixation, which started in Asia and is still occurring in Europe and Africa. The second haplotype is restricted to Europe and is not in linkage disequilibrium with the global haplotype. This European haplotype carries with it a mutation associated with autoimmune diseases. The authors hypothesize another mutation in the haplotype is what selection is acting on and this deleterious mutation is simply hitchhiking along with it.&lt;ref name=Vasseur2012 /&gt;

The second example comes from a paper titled "Synonymous Genes Explore Different Evolutionary Landscapes." &lt;ref name=Cambray2008&gt;Cambray G &amp; D Mazel. 2008. Synonymous Genes Explore Different Evolutionary Landscapes. PLoS Genetics 4(11).&lt;/ref&gt; (This article is publicly available; see the citation below.) The authors of this paper are broadly interested in the ability of a protein to evolve. They specifically wanted to know how [[synonymous substitutions]] affected the evolutionary landscape of a protein. To do this, they used a program called the Evolutionary Landscape Printer to design a synonymous version of the [[antibiotic resistance]] gene ''aac(6')-IB''. A synonymous protein has the same amino acid sequence but different nucleotide sequences. Thus, a synonymous protein has the same function and fitness value but a different surrounding evolutionary landscape. Basically, this is a way to jump peaks without actually moving.&lt;ref name=Cambray2008 /&gt; The landscape of the original protein and the synonymous copy were explored computationally with [[Monte Carlo simulations]] and error-prone [[PCR]]. The PCR products were then inserted into [[Competent cells|competent E. coli cells]] and screened for novel antibiotic resistance. They found that the two proteins gave rise to very different novel phenotypes that, theoretically, are unreachable by the other. From their results, the authors concluded that synonymous codons allow for a wider exploration of the local evolutionary landscape, and that the method they used increases the odds of finding an advantageous mutation, which is useful for predicting how a population might change and for designing better organisms for industry.&lt;ref name=Cambray2008 /&gt;

The '''Freshwater Biological Association''' (FBA) is an independent scientific organisation founded in 1929. Whilst originally created to be a research station it has evolved into a Learned Society whose mission is to "promote the sustainable management of freshwater ecosystems and resources, underpinned by the best available science".&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://www.fba.org.uk/mission-vision FBA's Mission]&lt;/ref&gt; The FBA promotes [[Limnology|freshwater science]] through innovative research, maintained specialist scientific facilities, a programme of scientific meetings, production of publications, and by providing sound independent scientific opinion.

The FBA hosts both published and unpublished collections, two specialist libraries and varieties of long term data sets from sites of scientific significance.It is managed by The Chief Executive, Dr Bill Brierley who is assisted by 25 staff (17 full-time equivalents).  A board of trustees, elected by the members, guide the strategic direction of the Association in line with the charitable objectives. The FBA is a [[registered charity]], number 214440 and a company limited by guarantee, registration number 263162, England.

==Activities==
The FBA is involved in many activities which include the support of Science through the use of its location in The Lake District in Cumbria and alongside the River Frome, East Stoke in Dorset and uses its location to support scientific work by providing specialist facilities and equipment.

The FBA is also involved in research through grants and studentships given to young scientists, and has made provisions for information services, from its freshwater libraries, to its information collection titled "FreshwaterLife", to its reference collection "The [[Felix Eugen Fritsch|Fritsch]] Collection".&lt;ref name="fritsch"&gt;[http://www.fritschalgae.info The Fritsch Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, many publications and analysis guides are also published by the FBA, with records of freshwater information.&lt;ref name="publications"&gt;[http://www.fba.org.uk/recorders FBA Recorders] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920153721/http://www.fba.org.uk/recorders |date=2010-09-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBA also runs many meetings and courses for specialism in [[freshwater biology]], holding an Annual Scientific Meeting.

On September 2008 the FBA launched a series of conferences in [[Aquatic Biology]]. The first of these was entitled "Multiple Stressors in Freshwater Ecosystems".  The second, in April 2010, had the theme of "Integrated Catchment Management".

'''Gametangiogamy''' is the fusion  or copulation of whole gametangia in certain [[Zygomycetes]] and [[Ascomycetes]].

'''The Gatty Marine Laboratory''' is a science facility located in the coastal town of [[St Andrews]] in [[Fife]], [[Scotland]]. It is part of the [[University of St Andrews]] and home to the [[Scottish Oceans Institute]], an interdisciplinary research institute studying the marine environment, specifically the [[behaviour]], [[ecology]], [[physiology]], [[population biology]] and [[functional genomics]] of marine organisms. The Gatty Marine Laboratory is known as the place where [[Richard G. Morris]] developed the [[Morris water navigation task]] in the early 1980s. 

==History==
The laboratory was paid for by the zoologist [[Charles Henry Gatty]] FRS FRSE FLS FGS (1836-1903) during his later life (1892), having to family to leave his fortune to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He paid both for an original timber building (1892)and its permanent stone replacement (1896). Its first Director was [[William Carmichael McIntosh]] [[FRSE]]. The permanent building was officially opened on 3 October 1896 by Lord Reay, at which point the timber building was abandoned. The building was badly damaged by fire in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.felbridge.org.uk/index.php/publications/charles-henry-gatty/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gatty Marine Laboratory has been continuously occupied except for the period between 1931 and the end of [[World War II]]. The laboratory has its origins in the government-funded St Andrews Fisheries Laboratory, which was founded in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/pageset.aspx?psr=438 Scottish Oceans Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The first director, Professor [[William Carmichael McIntosh]] FRS, conducted pioneering work on the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of [[annelids]] and the early life histories of marine fish over more than 50 years. In 1945-46 the Gatty received an operating budget of £50 and was used as a field station by zoologists and botanists based in the [[University of St Andrews School of Medicine|Bute Medical Building]] in the town centre.

From 1969 to 1985 the laboratory was under the Directorship of Prof [[Michael Laverack]].&lt;ref&gt;Independent (newspaper) obituary of M Laverack, 29 July 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1987, the "Gatty" (as it is informally known) has been a component Research Institute of the School of Biology (although the name and composition of the School has changed several times). The laboratory built up strong research groupings in fish biology and marine ecology and by the early 1990s received the highest number of research grants in marine biology of any UK department. In 1997, a major £4.3 million extension to the building was financed by the University Court. The new building provided a modern lecture theatre and teaching laboratory, and research laboratories for immunological and muscle research. The major part of the new build was occupied by the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] (NERC) sponsored [[Sea Mammal Research Unit]], which transferred to the site from Cambridge in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/site_docs/GattyHistory.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-06-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233232/http://soi.st-andrews.ac.uk/site_docs/GattyHistory.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-03 |df= }} History of the Gatty Marine Laboratory&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple''' also Gavipuram Cave Temple, an example of [[Indian rock-cut architecture]], is located in [[Bangalore]] in the state of [[Karnataka]] in [[India]]. The temple is famous for its mysterious stone discs in the forecourt and the exact planning allowing the sun to shine on shrine in certain time of the year. It was built in the 16th-century by [[Kempe Gowda I]], the founder of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shastry|first1=Vyasa|title=The mysteries of Bengaluru’s famed Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple|url=http://www.livemint.com/Sundayapp/X3uvXrojiRaPr31fhf6IQI/The-mysteries-of-Bengalurus-famed-Gavi-Gangadhareshwara-tem.html|work=Livemint|accessdate=2 March 2017|date=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temple==
This cave temple dedicated to [[Shiva]] in Bengaluru is a well visited temple. Built in the 16th century AD by Kempe Gowda, the founder of Bengaluru, Temple Gavi Gangadhareshwara is an architectural marvel that attracts the faithful by the hordes. One of the oldest temples in Bengaluru, Gavi Gangadhareshwara temple was built by Kempe Gowda in recognition after being released from prison of five years by Rama Raya. There are other idols inside idol Agnimurthi including having two heads, seven hands and three legs. Those who worship this deity believe will cure one of the defects of the eye. The temple is also known for its four monolithic pillars, representing [[Damaru]], [[Trishula|Trishul]] and two fans on the patio.

Built in a natural cave in Gavipuram, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and cut into a monolithic stone. The courtyard of the temple here contains several monolithic sculptures. The main attractions of Gavi Gangadhareshvara temple are two granite pillars that support the giant disk of the sun and moon, while the other two have a number of Nandi at the top.

On the occasion of [[Makar Sankranti]], temple witnesses a unique phenomenon in the evening sunlight passes through an arc between the horns of [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]] and falls directly on the [[linga]] inside the cave and illuminating the interior idol. This phenomenon is a proof of the technical excellence of the ancient architects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Illumination of shrine by the Sun ==
Thousands of devotees come in mid January every year on [[Makar]] [[sankranti]] Day to this cave temple. This is a special day  when the sunrays fall on the [[Shivalinga]] for one hour as it passes between the horns of the [[Nandi (bull)|Nandi]]. Such was the knowledge of architecture and astronomy that the ancient sculptors could craft the horns of the stone bull  outside the temple so that the sun's rays would pass through its horns and light up the deity [[Shiva]] [[Linga]] inside the cave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Comparison of contemporary structures and earlier drawings by [[Thomas Daniell]] and William Daniell show that earlier the temple has less structures and the Sun illuminated the shrine in summer and winter solstice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Also today the Sun illuminates Shivalinga two times per year - from 13 to 16 January in late afternoons and from 26 November to 2 December.

==Protected temple==
The temple shrine is a protected monument under the ''Karnataka Ancient and Historical Monuments, and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1961''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gavi Gangadhareshwara Temple, Bangalore|url=http://www.bengaloorutourism.com/gavi-gangadhareshwara-temple.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16726">'''Gender HCI''' is a subfield of [[human-computer interaction]] that focuses on the design and evaluation of interactive systems for humans. The specific emphasis in gender HCI is on differences in how [[gender|males and females]] interact with [[computer]]s.

==Examples==
Gender HCI research has been conducted in the following areas (among others): 
*Biases in perceptions of gendered computerized partners&lt;ref name=posard2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Posard|first1=Marek|title=Status processes in human-computer interactions: Does gender matter?|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=August 2014|volume=37|pages=189–195|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563214002349|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2014.04.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The effects of confidence and [[self-efficacy]] on both genders’ interactions with software.
*The design of gender-specific software, such as [[video games]] created for women.
*The design of [[computer display|display]] screen sizes and how they affect both genders.
*The design of gender-neutral [[problem-solving]] software.

==Overview==
Gender HCI investigates ways in which attributes of software (or even hardware) can interact with gender differences.
As with all of [[Human-Computer Interaction|HCI]], Gender HCI is a highly interdisciplinary area. Findings from fields such as [[psychology]], [[computer science]], [[marketing]], [[neuroscience]], [[education]], and [[economics]] strongly suggest that men and women problem solve, communicate, and process information differently. Gender HCI investigates whether these differences need to be taken into account in the design of software and hardware.

==History==
The term ''Gender HCI'' was coined in 2004 by Laura Beckwith, a PhD candidate at [[Oregon State University]], and her advisor [[Margaret Burnett]].&lt;ref name = "Beckwith and Burnett 2004"&gt;Beckwith, L. and Burnett, M. [ftp://ftp.cs.orst.edu/pub/burnett/vlhcc04.gender.pdf Gender: An important factor in end-user programming environments?], In ''Proc. Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing Languages'', IEEE (2004), 107-114.&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that, although there had been some activity that could be characterized as Gender HCI work, people did not know about each other's work. The relevant research reports were isolated and scattered about various fields. Since that time, they and others have worked to help researchers know about each other's work and practitioners to be aware of the findings, so as to allow this area to mature as a subarea of HCI. 

The following are a brief set of milestones in the history of this emerging subarea.
*'''1987''': Games designed as "gender neutral" look like games designed for boys. (Chuck Huff).
*'''1989''': Ethnographic research exploring women, programming, and computers (Sherry Turkle).
*'''1995''': Gender differences in self-efficacy and attitudes toward computers (Tor Busch).
*'''1998''': Gender factors in the design of video games ([[Justine Cassell]]).
*'''2002''': Wider displays more beneficial to all users, especially females ([[Mary Czerwinski]], Desney S. Tan, [[George G. Robertson]]).
*'''2004''': The concept Gender HCI made explicit (Laura Beckwith, Margaret Burnett).
*'''2006''': A research workshop on Gender HCI.&lt;ref&gt;De Angeli, A. and Bianchi-Berthouze, N. [http://www.informatics.manchester.ac.uk/%7Eantonella/gender/papers.htm Proceedings of Gender and Interaction, Real and Virtual Women in a Male World Workshop], Venice, May 23, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected Gender HCI Findings==
Here are some results from the Gender HCI research conducted to date - ordered from most to least recent, within categories: 
#"Reward Expectations of Gendered Computers."
#*In one experiment, subjects worked on a task with a computerized partner that was named James or Julie. The task was gender-neutral, meaning that it was not directly relevant to being a man or woman. The results showed that subjects behaved the same way toward a computer named James or Julie. Despite these similarities in behavior, subjects estimated that a computer named James would cost them significantly more than one named Julie. The findings show gender shape user perceptions of their computers, which lack the human features that define the characteristic of gender.&lt;ref name=posard2014 /&gt;
#''Confidence-related findings.''
#*For [[spreadsheet]] problem-solving tasks, (1) female end users had significantly lower self-efficacy than males and (2) women with low self-efficacy were significantly less likely to work effectively with problem-solving features available in the software. In contrast, males’ self-efficacy did not impact their effectiveness with these features.&lt;ref name="Beckwith 2005"&gt;Beckwith, L. Burnett, M., Wiedenbeck, S., Cook, C., Sorte, S., and Hastings, M. [ftp://ftp.cs.orst.edu/pub/burnett/chi05.gender.pdf Effectiveness of end-user debugging software features: Are there gender issues?] ''ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'' (2005), 869-878.&lt;/ref&gt;
#*In a study of the computer attitudes and self-efficacy of 147 college students, gender differences existed in self-efficacy for complex tasks (such as [[word processing]] and spreadsheet software), but not simpler tasks. Also, male students had more experience working with computers and reported more encouragement from parents and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Busch, T. [http://eusesconsortium.org/twiki/pub/Main/GenderReferenceFiles/GenderDiffSE_Busch.pdf Gender differences in self efficacy and attitudes towards computer], ''Journal of Educational Computing Research 12'',(1995)147-158.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Software feature related findings.''
#*In spreadsheet problem-solving tasks, female end users were significantly slower to try out unfamiliar features.&lt;ref name="Beckwith and Burnett 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Beckwith 2005"/&gt; Females significantly more often agreed with the statement, "I was afraid I would take too long to learn the [untaught feature]." Even if they tried it once, females were significantly less likely to adopt new features for repeated use. For females, unlike for males, self-efficacy predicted the amount of effective feature usage. There was no significant difference in the success of the two genders or in learning how the features worked, implying that females’ low self-efficacy about their usage of new features was not an accurate assessment of their problem-solving potential, but rather became a self-fulfilling prophecy.&lt;ref name="Beckwith 2005"/&gt;
#''Behavior related findings.''
#*In spreadsheet problem-solving tasks, tinkering (playfully experimenting) with features was adopted by males more often than females. While males were comfortable with this behavior, some did it to excess. For females, the amount of tinkering predicted success. Pauses after any action were predictive of better understanding for both genders.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, L.  Kissinger, C., Burnett, M., Wiedenbeck, S., Lawrance, J., [[Alan F. Blackwell|Blackwell, A.]], and Cook, C. [ftp://ftp.cs.orst.edu/pub/burnett/chi06-genderTinker.pdf Tinkering and gender in end-user programmers' debugging], ''ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems'', (2006), 231-240.&lt;/ref&gt;
#*Males viewed machines as a challenge, something to be mastered, overcome, and be measured against. They were risk-takers, and they demonstrated this by eagerly trying new techniques and approaches. Females rejected the image of the male [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] as alienating and depersonalizing. Their approach to computers was "soft;" tactile, artistic, and communicative.&lt;ref&gt;Turkle, S. Computational reticence: Why women fear the intimate machine. In ''Technology and Women's Voices'', Cheris Kramerae (ed.), (1988), 41-61.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Hardware interface findings.''
#*Larger displays helped reduce the gender gap in navigating virtual environments. With smaller displays, males’ performance was better than females’. With larger displays, females’ performance improved and males’ performance was not negatively affected.&lt;ref&gt;Czerwinski, M., Tan, D., and Robertson, G., [http://research.microsoft.com/users/marycz/chi2002fov.pdf Women take a wider view], In ''Proc. CHI 2002'', ACM Press (2002), 195-202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tan, S., Czerwinski, M., and Robertson, G.,  [http://research.microsoft.com/users/marycz/chi2003flow.pdf Women go with the (optical) flow, In Proc. of CHI 2003], ''Human Factors in Computing Systems'', (2003), 209-215.&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Video games findings.''
#*Several findings were reported about girls’ interests that relate to video games, with interpretations for the video game software industry.&lt;ref&gt;Gorriz, C. and Medina, C. [http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/330000/323843/p42-gorriz.pdf?key1=323843&amp;key2=6103519801&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=23821858&amp;CFTOKEN=26261732 Engaging girls with computers through software games]. ''Communications of the ACM'', (2000), 42-49.&lt;/ref&gt;
#*Several researchers explored what girls seek in [[video game]]s, and implications for video game designers. Among the implications were collaboration vs. competition preferences, and use of non-violent rewards versus death and destruction as rewards. These works argue both sides of the question as to whether or not to design games specifically for girls.&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, J. [http://eusesconsortium.org/twiki/pub/Main/GenderReferenceFiles/gender_.hci.just.pdf Genderizing HCI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007150137/http://eusesconsortium.org/twiki/pub/Main/GenderReferenceFiles/gender_.hci.just.pdf |date=October 7, 2007 }}, ''MIT Media Lab'', (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cassell, J. and Jenkins, H.

#''Other related findings about gender and computers.''
#*In a study of the way people interacted with conversational software agents in relation to the sex of the agent, the female virtual agent received many more [[violence against women|violent]] and sexual overtures than either the male one or the gender-free one (a robot).&lt;ref&gt;De Angeli, A. and Brahnam, S.

''In Proc. of Gender and Interaction'', Real and Virtual Women in a Male World Workshop, (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;
#*In the home, where many appliances are programmable to some extent, different categories of appliance were found to be more likely to be programmed by men (e.g. entertainment devices) and by women (e.g. kitchen appliances). There is often one member of a household who assumes responsibility for programming a particular device, with a "domestic economy" accounting for this task.&lt;ref&gt;Rode, J.A., Toye, E.F. and [[Blackwell, A.F.]], [http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~afb21/publications/2ADfuzzyFelt.pdf The Fuzzy Felt Ethnography - understanding the programming patterns of domestic appliances]. ''Personal and Ubiquitous Computing 8'', (2004), 161-176.&lt;/ref&gt;
#*Males and females had different perceptions for whether a web page would be appropriate for his/her home country, and further, females more often than males preferred more information on all web pages viewed during a study.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, S., [http://delivery.acm.org/10.1145/510000/506744/p18-simon.pdf?key1=506744&amp;key2=2505548801&amp;coll=portal&amp;dl=ACM&amp;CFID=23486558&amp;CFTOKEN=89848799 The impact of culture and gender on web sites: An empirical study], ''The Data Base for Advances in Information Systems'', 32(1), (2001), 18-37.&lt;/ref&gt;
#*Women who entered mathematics, science, and technology careers had high academic and social self-efficacy. Their self-efficacy was based on vicarious experiences and verbal persuasion of significant people around them.&lt;ref&gt;Zeldin, A. and Pajares, F., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1163477 Against the odds: Self-efficacy beliefs of women in mathematical, scientific, and technological careers]. ''American Educational Research Journal'', 37, (2000), 215-246.&lt;/ref&gt;
#*Factors affecting low retention of women in computer science majors in college included women’s lower previous experience in computing compared to men, their low self-perceived ability, discouragement by the dominant male peer culture, and lack of encouragement from faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, J., and Fisher, A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3642">The '''Gender Parity Index''' ('''GPI''') is a [[socioeconomic]] index usually designed to measure the relative access to [[education]] of males and females. This index is released by UNESCO. In its simplest form, it is calculated as the quotient of the number of females by the number of males enrolled in a given stage of education ([[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]], etc.). It is used by international organizations, particularly in measuring the progress of developing countries. The Institute for Statistics of [[UNESCO]] also uses a more general definition of GPI: for any development indicator one can define the GPI ''relative'' to this indicator by dividing its value for females by its value for males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/aims/Pattaya_SCB_Jun05/Gender_Parity_Index_-_Michael_Koronkiewicz.pdf |title=Gender Parity Index|last=Koronkiewicz|first=Michael |publisher=UNESCO Bangkok|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, some UNESCO documents consider gender parity in [[literacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001472/147259M.pdf|title=Education for All (EFA) in least developed countries|date=2006|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

UNESCO describes attempts to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education and emphasizes the plight of girls in unequal access in third world countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unescobkk.org/fileadmin/user_upload/aims/Pattaya_SCB_Jun05/Gender_Parity_Index_-_Michael_Koronkiewicz.pdf |title=Gender Parity Index|last=Koronkiewicz|first=Michael |publisher=UNESCO Bangkok|accessdate=2008-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the GPI ignores the gender disparity that benefits first-world women in [[tertiary education]] as in Iceland, for example, where 65% of students enrolling in tertiary education are female.

The '''glass tax''' was introduced in Great Britain in 1746, during the reign of King [[George II of England|George II]]. Glass was at that time sold by weight, and manufacturers responded by producing smaller, more highly decorated objects, often with hollow stems, known today as "Excise glasses".{{sfnp|Hurst-Vose|1980|p=|ps=none}} In 1780, the government granted Ireland free trade in glass without taxation, resulting in the establishment of glassworks in [[Cork (city)|Cork]] and [[Waterford]]. In 1825, the tax in Ireland was restored, and gradually the industry declined, until the glass tax was abolished by Sir [[Robert Peel]]'s government in 1845.{{sfnp|Tait|2004|p=|ps=none}}

A contemporary account in the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' described the glass tax as an "absurd impost on light":
{{quote|In a hygienic point of view, the enormous tax on glass, amounting to more than three hundred per cent on its value, is one of the most cruel a Government could inflict on the nation&amp;nbsp;... The deficiency of light in town habitations, in a great measure caused by the enormous cost of glass, is universally admitted to be one of the principal causes of the unhealthiness of cities ...{{r|Lancet}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2215">'''Homeworkers''' or '''home workers''' are defined by the [[International Labour Organization]] as people working from their homes or from other premises of their choosing other than the workplace, for payment, which results of a product or service specified by the employer.  There are an estimated 300 million homeworkers in the world {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, though because these workers generally function in the [[informal economy]], and are seldom registered and often not contracted, exact numbers are difficult to come by.  Recently, the phenomenon of homework has grown with increased [[communication technology]], as well as changes in supply chains, particularly the development of [[Just In Time (business)|Just In Time]] inventory systems. Homeworkers are often employed in [[piece work]].

Homeworkers differ from [[entrepreneur]]s, or [[self-employed]], or [[family business]], in that they are hired by companies for specific activities or services to be done from their homes.  Homeworkers do not own or operate the business they work for.  Though there is a significant body of highly skilled homeworkers, particularly in [[information technology]], most homeworkers are considered low skilled labour.  Recently, working conditions have worsened for homeworkers {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}, and they are becoming a point of concern for [[international development]] organizations and [[non-governmental organization]]s {{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

The NESC is a most important document for safeguarding persons against electrical hazards during the installation, operation and maintenance of electric supply and communication lines.   More essentially, it includes general updates and critical revisions that directly contact the power utility industry. Adopted by law by the majority of states and Public Service Commissions across the US, the NESC is a performance code considered to be the authoritative source on good [[electrical engineering]] practice.

''Infrastructure for Peace'' is a new approach in [[peacebuilding]] which gained momentum after locally led and participatory peacebuilding practices tended to yield effective results in some countries beset by conflicts. It underpins the ideas of [[conflict transformation]] and stresses on under-girding the politically negotiated settlements at top level by peacebuilding efforts at the grassroots.

==Definition==
In 2010, governments, political parties, civil society and [[United Nations]] country representatives from 14 African countries in [[Kenya]] agreed upon a working definition of ''infrastructures for peace'' as a ‘dynamic network of interdependent structures, mechanisms, resources, values and skills which, through dialogue and consultation, contribute to conflict prevention and [[peacebuilding]] in a society’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=JPD Editors|title=The Evolving Landscape of Infrastructures for Peace|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=1–7|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774793|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15423166.2013.774793#.VXvjcfmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Studies exemplify [[National Peace Council (Ghana)]], Department on Ethnic, Religious Policy and Civil Society Interaction (Kyrgyzstan)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kumar|first1=Chetan|last2=de la Haye|first2=Jos|title=‘Hybrid Peacemaking: Building National "Infrastructures for Peace"’|journal=Global Governance|date=2012|volume=18|issue=1|pages=13–20|url=http://www.undp.org/content/dam/undp/library/crisis%20prevention/UNDP_BCPR_Chetan%20Kumar_Infrastructures%20for%20Peace.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and economical approaches in Guyana, Bolivia and Kenya and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] contributes to about 30 infrastructures for peace projects around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ryan|first1=Jordan|title=Infrastructures for Peace as a Path to Resilient Societies: An Institutional Perspective|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=14–24|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774806|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15423166.2013.774806#.VXvk9Pmqqko}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Critical studies on the ''infrastructure for peace'' mainly see this as a fuzzy concept because [[peacebuilding]] cannot be guaranteed only by local efforts. Such local infrastructures are prone to suffer from political upheavals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chuma|first1=Aeneas|last2=Ojielo|first2=Ozonnia|title=Building a Standing National Capacity for Conflict Prevention and Resolution in Kenya|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=25–39|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.774790}}&lt;/ref&gt; they still rely on external funding and cannot do well under strictly autocratic regimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Odendaal|first1=Andries|title=The Political Legitimacy of National Peace Committees|journal=Journal of Peacebuilding &amp; Development|date=December 2012|volume=7|issue=3|pages=40–53|doi=10.1080/15423166.2013.767601}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21647259.2016.1156813?journalCode=rpcb20 New research works], which conflate infrastructures for peace with [[security sector reform]] have also suggested such architectures need to rise above local boundaries to negotiate on security issues because (in)security has transnational connections.&lt;ref&gt;Ghimire, Safal. 2016.

==Measures==
===Lexicostatistics===
The proposed measures used for linguisitic distance reflect varying understandings of the term itself. One approach is based on [[mutual intelligibility]], i.e. the ability of speakers of one language to understand the other language. With this, the higher the linguistic distance, the lower is the level of mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"&gt;{{Citation | title=Receptive multilingualism: linguistic analyses, language policies, and didactic concepts |author1=Jan D. ten Thije |author2=Ludger Zeevaert | publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2007 | isbn=978-90-272-1926-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8gIEN068J3gC | quote=''... Assuming that intelligibility is inversely related to linguistic distance ... the content words the percentage of cognates (related directly or via a synonym) ... lexical relatedness ... grammatical relatedness ...''|date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[cognate|cognate words]] play an important role in mutual intelligibility between languages, these figure prominently in such analyses. The higher the percentage of cognate (as opposed to non-cognate) words in the two languages with respect to one another, the lower is their linguistic distance. Also, the greater the degree of grammatical relatedness (i.e. the cognates mean roughly similar things) and lexical relatedness (i.e. the cognates are easily discernible as related words), the lower is the linguistic distance.&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt; As an example of this, the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''pānch'' is grammatically identical and [[lexical similarity|lexically similar]] (but non-identical) to its cognate [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''panj'' as well as to the lexically dissimilar but still grammatically identical [[Greek language|Greek]] ''pent-''&lt;ref&gt;[[List of Greek and Latin roots in English#P]]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[English language|English]] ''five''. As another example, the English ''dish'' and [[German language|German]] ''tisch'' 'table' are lexically (phonologically) similar but grammatically (semantically) dissimilar. Cognates in related languages can even be identical in form, but semantically distinct, such as ''caldo'' and ''largo'', which mean respectively  'hot' and 'wide' in Italian but 'broth, soup' and 'long' in Spanish. Using a statistical approach (called [[lexicostatistics]]) by comparing each language's mass of words, distances can be calculated between them. In technical terms, what is calculated is the [[Levenshtein distance]].&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt; Based on this, one study compared both [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] with [[Dutch language|Dutch]] to see which was closer to Dutch. It determined that the Dutch and Afrikaans (mutual distance of 20.9%) were considerably closer than Dutch and West Frisian (mutual distance of 34.2%).&lt;ref name="ref05xubej"/&gt;

However, lexicostatistical methods, which are based on retentions from a common proto-language – and not innovations – are problematic due to a number of reasons, so some linguists argue they cannot be relied upon during the tracing of a phylogenetic tree (for example, highest retention rates can sometimes be found in the opposite, peripheral ends of a language family).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems"&gt;http://www.elisanet.fi/alkupera/Problems_of_phylogenetics.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual innovativeness or conservativeness of a language can distort linguistic distance and the assumed separation date, examples being [[Romani language]] and [[East Baltic languages]] respectively.&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt; On the one hand, continued [[Language contact|adjacency]] of closely related languages after their separation can make some loanwords 'invisible' (indistinguishable from cognates, see [[etymological nativization]]), therefore,  from lexicostatistical point of view these languages appear less distant then they actually are (examples being [[Finnic languages|Finnic]] and [[Saami languages]]).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt; On the other hand, strong foreign influence of languages spreading far from their homeland can make them share less inherited words than they should do (examples being [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Samoyedic languages]] in the East Uralic branch).&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt;

===Other internal aspects===
Besides cognates, other aspects that are often measured are similarities of [[syntax]] and written forms.&lt;ref name="chiswick2004hsk"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chiswick | first1 = B. R. | last2 = Miller | first2 = P. W. | doi = 10.1080/14790710508668395 | title = Linguistic Distance: A Quantitative Measure of the Distance Between English and Other Languages | journal = Journal of Multilingual and Multicultural Development | volume = 26 | pages = 1–11 | year = 2005 | pmid =  | pmc = | hdl = 10419/20510 }} ''... vocabulary, grammar, written form, syntax and myriad other statistics ... this scalar measure of "linguisitic distance" is demonstrated through an analysis of the determinants of English language proficiency among immigrants ...''&lt;/ref&gt;

To overcome the aforementioned problems of the lexicostatistical methods, [[Donald Ringe]], [[Tandy Warnow]] and [[Luay Nakhleh]] developed a complex phylogenetical method relying on phonological and morphological innovations in 2000s.&lt;ref name="phyloproblems" /&gt;

===Language learning===
A 2004 paper by economists Barry Chiswick and Paul Miller attempted to put forth a metric for linguistic distances that was based on empirical observations of how rapidly speakers of a given language gained proficiency in another one when immersed in a society that overwhelmingly communicated in the latter language. In this study, the speed of English language acquisition was studied for immigrants of various linguistic backgrounds in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].{{Vague|date=January 2014}}&lt;ref name="chiswick2004hsk"/&gt;

'''MASC''' is a balanced subset of 500K words of written texts and transcribed speech drawn primarily from the Open [[American National Corpus]] (OANC). The OANC is a 15 million word (and growing) corpus of American English produced since 1990, all of which is in the public domain or otherwise free of usage and redistribution restrictions.

All of MASC includes manually validated annotations for logical structure (headings, sections, paragraphs, etc.), sentence boundaries, three different tokenizations with associated part of speech tags, shallow parse (noun and verb chunks), named entities (person, location, organization, date and time), and [https://web.archive.org/web/20131109202842/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~treebank/ Penn Treebank] syntax. Additional manually produced or validated annotations have been produced by the MASC project for portions of the sub-corpus, including full-text annotation for [[FrameNet]] frame elements and a 100K+ sentence corpus with [[WordNet]] 3.1 sense tags, of which one-tenth are also annotated for [[FrameNet]] frame elements. Annotations of all or portions of the sub-corpus for a wide variety of other linguistic phenomena have been contributed by other projects, including [[PropBank]], [[TimeBank]], [http://mpqa.cs.pitt.edu/corpora/mpqa_corpus/ MPQA opinion], and several others. Co-reference annotations and clause boundaries of the entire MASC corpus are scheduled to be released by the end of 2016.

WordNet sense annotations for all occurrences of 114 words are also included in the MASC distribution, as well as [[FrameNet]] annotations for 50-100 occurrences of each of the 114 words. The sentences with [[WordNet]] and [[FrameNet]] annotations are also distributed as a part of the [http://www.anc.org/data/masc/wordnet-framenet-annotations/ MASC Sentence Corpus].

All MASC annotations, whether contributed or produced in-house, are transduced to the Graph Annotation Format (GrAF) defined by ISO TC37 SC4’s Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF).
The online tool [http://www.anc.org/software/anc2go/ ANC2Go] can transduce annotations over all or parts of MASC to any of several other formats, including CONLL IOB format and formats for use in [[UIMA]] and [[General Architecture for Text Engineering]].

== Distribution ==

MASC is an open data resource that can be used by anyone for any purpose. At the same time, it is a collaborative community resource that is sustained by community contributions of annotations and derived data. It is freely downloadable from the [http://www.anc.org/data/masc/downloads/data-download/ MASC download page] or through the [[Linguistic Data Consortium]].

MASC is also distributed in part-of-speech-tagged form with the [[Natural Language Toolkit]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11936">{{short description|A pipeline or tunnel that discharges municipal or industrial wastewater, stormwater, combined sewer overflows, cooling water, or brine effluents from water desalination plants to the sea}}
A '''marine outfall''' is a pipeline or tunnel that discharges municipal or industrial [[wastewater]], [[stormwater]], [[combined sewer overflow]]s, [[cooling water]], or [[brine]] effluents from [[water desalination]] plants to the sea. Usually they discharge under the sea's surface (submarine outfall). In the case of municipal wastewater, effluent is often being discharged after having undergone no or only primary [[Wastewater treatment|treatment]], with the intention of using the assimilative capacity of the sea for further treatment. Submarine [[outfall]]s are common throughout the world and probably number in the thousands. More than 200 outfalls alone have been listed in a single international database maintained by the Institute for Hydromechanics at [[Karlsruhe University]] for the [[International Association of Hydraulic Engineering and Research]] (IAHR) / [[International Water Association]] (IWA) Committee on Marine Outfall Systems.&lt;ref name="Database"&gt;[http://www.outfalls.net.ms/ Outfalls Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080628233110/http://www.outfalls.net.ms/ |date=2008-06-28 }} Click on "Activities", then "Outfalls repository", then "database", then "Output"&lt;/ref&gt;

The World's first marine outfall was built in [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]], United States, in 1910. In Latin America and the Caribbean there were 134 outfalls with more than 500 m length in 2006 for wastewater disposal alone, according to a survey by the Pan American Center for Sanitary Engineering and Environmental Sciences (CEPIS) of [[Pan American Health Organization|PAHO]]. According to the survey, the largest number of municipal wastewater outfalls in the region exist in Venezuela (39), Chile (39) and Brazil (22).&lt;ref  name="Database"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The World's largest marine outfall is located in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/about_bwsc/systems/outfall_maps/outfall_maps.asp&lt;/ref&gt;Currently, Boston has approximately 235 miles of combined sewers and 37 active CSO outfalls. Lots of outfalls are simply known by a public used name, e.g. Boston Outfall.&lt;ref name="MWWD2002"&gt;[http://people.ufpr.br/~tobias.dhs/outfalls/download/MWWD2002-outfalls%20database%20and%20exchange.pdf OUTFALLS DATABASE AND INFORMATION EXCHANGE] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728014543/http://people.ufpr.br/~tobias.dhs/outfalls/download/MWWD2002-outfalls%20database%20and%20exchange.pdf |date=2015-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_INNERHARBOR.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_DORCHESTERBAY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bwsc.org/ABOUT_BWSC/systems/outfall_maps/CSO_CHARLES.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

According to the Australian engineer [[Sharon Beder]] the main advantages of marine outfalls for the discharge of wastewater are:
*the natural [[:wikt:dilution|dilution]] and [[Dispersion (chemistry)|dispersion]] of [[organic matter]], [[pathogens]] and other pollutants
*the ability to keep the sewage field submerged because of the depth at which the [[sewage]] is being released
*the greater die-off rate of pathogens due to the greater distance they will have to travel to shore.&lt;ref name="Beder"&gt;Beder, Sharon: [http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/sewage/phd.html From Pipe Dreams to Tunnel Vision: Engineering Decision-Making and Sydney's Sewerage System], Ph.D. Thesis, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA 1989, Chapter 8: The 'Science' and 'Metaphysics' of Submarine Outfalls&lt;/ref&gt;

They also tend to be less expensive than advanced wastewater treatment plants, using the natural assimilative capacity of the sea instead of energy-intensive treatment processes in a plant. For example, preliminary treatment of wastewater is sufficient with an effective outfall and diffuser. The costs of preliminary treatment are about one tenth that of secondary treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Philip JW Roberts:"Underwater and underused: The case of marine outfalls in wastewater disposal", in Water21, Magazine of the International Water Association, October 2010, pp. 22-26&lt;/ref&gt; Preliminary treatment also requires much less land than advanced wastewater treatment.

== Disadvantages ==

Marine outfalls for partially treated or untreated wastewater remain controversial. Still according to [[Sharon Beder]], the design calculation and computer models for pollution modeling have been criticized, arguing that dilution has been overemphasized and that other mechanisms work in the opposite direction, such as [[bioaccumulation]] of [[toxins]], [[sedimentation]] of [[sludge]] particles and [[Flocculation|agglomeration]] of sewage particles with [[Fat|grease]]. Accumulative mechanisms include slick formation, windrow formation, [[flocculate]] formation and agglomerated formation. Grease or wax can interfere with dispersion, so that bacteria and viruses could be carried to remote locations where the concentration of bacterial predators would be low and the die-off rate much lower.&lt;ref name="Beder"/&gt;

== Technology ==

Outfalls vary in diameter from as narrow as 15&amp;nbsp;cm to as wide as 8 m; the widest registered outfall in the world with 8 m diameter is located in [[Navia (Spain)]] for the discharge of industrial wastewater. Outfalls vary in length from 50 m to 55&amp;nbsp;km, the longest registered outfalls being the [[Boston]] outfall with a length of 16&amp;nbsp;km and an industrial outfall in [[Ankleshwar]] (India) with a length of 55&amp;nbsp;km. The depth of the deepest point of an outfall varies from 3 m to up to 60 m, the deepest registered outfall being located in [[Macuto, Vargas]] (Venezuela) for the discharge of untreated municipal wastewater.

Outfall materials include [[polyethylene]], [[stainless steel]], [[carbon steel]], [[glass-reinforced plastic]], [[reinforced concrete]], [[cast iron]] or tunnels through rock. Common installation methods for pipelines are float and sink, bottom pull and top pull.&lt;ref name="Database"/&gt;

== Controversies ==

In the 1960s the city of [[Sydney]] decided to build ocean sewage outfalls to discharge partially treated sewage 2–4&amp;nbsp;km offshore at a cost of US$ 300 million. In the late 1980s, however, the government promised to upgrade the coastal treatment plants so that sewage would be treated to at least secondary treatment standards before discharge into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/sbeder/sewage/elephants.html Sharon Beder, 'Getting into Deep Water: Sydney's Extended Ocean Sewage Outfalls'] in Pam Scott, ed., A Herd of White Elephants: Australia's Science &amp; Technology Policy, Hale and Iremonger, Sydney, 1992, pp62-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The submarine outfall in [[Cartagena, Colombia]] was financed with a loan by the [[World Bank]]. It was subsequently challenged by residents claiming that the wastewater caused damage to the marine environment and to fisheries. The case was taken up by the [[World Bank's Inspection Panel]], which contracted two independent three-dimensional modeling efforts in 2006. Both "confirmed that the 2.85km long submarine outfall (was) adequate."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2006/12/13/000020953_20061213134653/Rendered/INDEX/38182.txt World Bank Inspection Panel Progress Report on Cartagena Water Supply, Sewerage and Environmental Management Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3245">The '''Media Dispatch Protocol''' (MDP) was developed by the [[Pro-MPEG]] Media Dispatch Group to provide an open standard for secure, automated, and tapeless delivery of audio, video and associated data files. Such files typically range from low resolution content for the web to [[Hdtv|HDTV]] and high-resolution digital intermediate files for cinema production.

MDP is essentially a [[middleware]] protocol that decouples the technical details of how delivery occurs from the business logic that requires delivery. For example, a TV post-production company might have a contract to deliver a programme to a broadcaster.  An MDP [[Software agent|agent]] allows users be able to deal with company and programme names, rather than with filenames and network endpoints. It can also provide a delivery service as part of a [[Service-oriented architecture|service oriented architecture]].

MDP acts as a communication layer between business logic and low-level file transfer mechanisms, providing a way to securely communicate and negotiate transfer-specific metadata about file packages, delivery routing, deadlines, and security information, and to manage and coordinate file transfers in progress, whilst hooking all this information to project, company and job identifiers.

MDP works by implementing a 'dispatch transaction' layer by which means agents negotiate and agree the details of the individual file transfers required for the delivery, and control, monitor and report on the progress of the transfers. At the heart of the protocol is the 'Manifest' - an XML document that encapsulates the information about the transaction.

MDP is based on existing open technologies such as [[XML]], [[HTTP]] and [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]. The protocol is specified in a layered way to allow the adoption of new technologies (e.g. [[Web Services]] protocols such as [[Simple Object Access Protocol|SOAP]] and [[Web Services Description Language|WSDL]]) as required.

Since early 2005, multiple implementations based on draft versions of the Media Dispatch Protocol have been in use, both for technical testing, and, since April 2005, for real-world production work. The experience with these implementations, both at the engineering level, and at the practical production level, has been rolled into the 1.0rcX specification. 

A newer, and more complete, open-source reference implementation is now available on [[Sourceforge|SourceForge]].

Media Dispatch Protocol (MDP) has been standardized by a [[SMPTE]] Working Group under the S22 Committee. This work has been published as SMPTE 2032-1-2007 (MDP specification), 2032-2-2007 (MDP/[[XML]]/[[HTTP]] mapping specification) and 2032-3-2007 (MDP Target pull profile specification). MDP is also supported by [[SMPTE]] Engineering Guideline EG 2032-4-2007 covering the use of MDP.

The '''Monheim Town Hall''' ([[German language|German]] ''Monheimer Rathaus'') is a historical  building   in [[Monheim, Bavaria|Monheim]], [[Bavaria]], southern [[Germany]], now owned by the city's council.

The building, constructed from 1714 to 1720 for a rich Jewish merchant, the [[Court Jew]] Abraham Elias Model, is most notable for its [[ceiling]]s, displaying motifs from the [[Old Testament]], or [[Tanakh]], which were restored in 1978 and 1994 respectively.&lt;ref name="Kostbar"&gt;{{de icon}} ''Monheim - Kleine Stadt mit grosser Vergangenheit'', Chapter: Jews as citizens in Monheim, by: Emeran Meyer (Mayor of Monheim 1978-84), page: 117-123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.junge-pfalz.de/broschuere/die_junge_pfalz.pdf ''Die Junge Pfalz''] {{de icon}} ''The young Palatinate'', page: 11, accessed: 6 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===The Jewish community===
The Jewish community in Monheim was established in 1697, when Duke [[Johann Wilhelm, Elector Palatine|Johann Wilhelm]] allowed six Jewish families which had been banned from [[Eichstätt]], to settle in Monheim. The new community was allowed to acquire property in Monheim, to construct a [[Synagogue]] and to work as merchants in town. In the following years, the community grew considerably, numbering 19 families and 150 people by 1737.&lt;ref name="Community" &gt;[http://www.alemannia-judaica.de/monheim_synagoge.htm History of the Jewish community in Monheim] {{de icon}}, accessed: 6 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospering community however raised concerns with the local population, which was worried about eventually becoming outnumbered in town. In 1736, restrictions were passed, allowing only a limited number of weddings to be conducted by the local Jews at considerable cost. In 1741, Duke [[Charles III Philip, Elector Palatine|Charles III Philip]] passed an act banning all Jews from [[Palatinate-Neuburg]]. By the 31 July 1741, all Jews had to leave his lands and were only permitted to take with them what they could carry. No financial compensation was made for their loss of property. The Jews from Monheim left for the towns in the region not part of Palatinate-Neuburg and their origin from Monheim remains obvious through the surname ''Monheim'' or ''Monheimer''.&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

===The town hall===
The location of the current town hall was acquired by Abraham Elias Model in 1712 from Ferdinand Kugler for 1,025 [[Baden gulden|Gulden]].&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt; The later owned a brewery and guest house at the spot, called ''Gasthaus zur Rose''. Model had the old building demolished and commissioned a new building to be constructed, which was erected between 1714 and 1720.&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt;

The new building, which was referred to in the local town chronicles as "very precious", was built in [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] style. It was a square three-story building which was richly decorated, especially the ceilings. The main room on the second floor, now the council chambers, depict [[Abraham]] being prevented by the angel from sacrificing [[Isaac]], with a text in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] from the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

The ceiling, long hidden, was only restored in 1978.&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt; Two more ceilings, also on the second floor, were restored in 1994. One depicts [[Moses]] receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] while the other shows King [[David]] playing the [[harp]].&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

For a time it was assumed that the house also functioned as a synagogue, Monheim having had a [[Rabbi]] since 1715, but this has since been disproven. Nothing is left of the former synagogue, which was located in the nearby building that later became the guest house ''Zum Ochsen''.&lt;ref name="Kostbar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Community" /&gt;

With the forced departure of the Jews in 1741, the building came into non-Jewish, private possession. In 1853, it was acquired by the town from the brewer Anton Wunderlich, to be used as a school house. For this purpose, the chamber that is now the main council chamber was subdivided into two rooms. The rooms were nevertheless insufficient to house all pupils and a separate building was constructed from 1892 to 1895 to house the school boys, while the girls stayed at the town hall. Eventually, two more, larger schools were completed, one in 1957 and 1976. With the completion of the later, the town hall ceased to be required for schooling purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} ''Monheim - Kleine Stadt mit grosser Vergangenheit'', Chapter: "To read and to write...", by: Dr. Paul Olbrich, page: 137-144&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceilings on the second floor can be visited free of charge during the opening hours of the town hall, provided no marriages or council meetings take place in the rooms at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12880">'''Musical hallucinations'''  fall under the category of [[auditory hallucinations]] and describe a disorder in which a sound is perceived as instrumental music, sounds, or songs. It is a very rare disorder, reporting only 0.16% in a cohort study of 3,678 individuals.&lt;ref name ="Evers"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Evers |first=S |author2=Ellger, T |title=The clinical spectrum of musical hallucinations |journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences |year=2004 |volume=227 |issue=1 |pages=55–65 |pmid=15546592 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2004.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description of disorder ==
In 73 individual cases reviewed by Evers and Ellger, 57 patients heard tunes that were familiar, while 5 heard unfamiliar tunes. These tunes ranged from religious pieces to childhood favorites, and also included popular songs from the radio. Vocal and instrumental forms of classical music were also identified in some patients. Keshavan found that the consistent feature of musical hallucinations was that it represented a personal memory trace. Memory traces refer to anything that may seem familiar to the patient, which indicate why certain childhood or familiar songs were heard.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keshavan" /&gt;

== Causes ==
Investigators have successfully narrowed down the major factors that are associated with musical hallucinations. Evers and Ellgers compiled a significant portion of musical hallucination articles, case studies etc. and were able to categorize five major etiologies:

* [[Hypoacusis]]
* [[Musical hallucinations#Psychiatric disorders|Psychiatric disorders]]
* [[Focal brain lesion]]
* [[Epilepsy]]
* [[Substance intoxication|Intoxication]]

=== Hypoacusis ===
Hypoacusis is defined as impairment in hearing or deafness. Hypoacusis is one of five etiologies of musical hallucinations, and is the most common in the case studies reviewed by Evers and Ellgers.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; According to Sanchez et al. 2011, there have been suggestions that pontine lesions could alter the central auditory system's function causing hypoacusis and musical hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Hammeke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hammeke |first=TA |author2=McQuillen, MP |author3=Cohen, BA  |title=Musical hallucinations associated with acquired deafness |journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry |year=1983 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=570–2 |pmid=6875592 |pmc=1027453 |doi=10.1136/jnnp.46.6.570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanchez"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sanchez |first=TG|author2=Rocha, SC |author3=Knobel, KA |author4=Kii, MA |author5=Santos, RM |author6= Pereira, CB  |title=Musical hallucination associated with hearing loss |journal=Arquivos de neuro-psiquiatria |year=2011 |volume=69 |issue=2B |pages=395–400 |pmid=21625772 |doi=10.1590/s0004-282x2011000300024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychiatric disorders ===
A case study by Janakiraman et al. 2006, revealed a 93‑year‑old woman with [[major depressive disorder]] who experienced musical hallucinations while treated with [[electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT). Investigators found that the patient's depression symptoms were inversely related to her hallucinations and primarily stemmed from the ECT treatment.  The patient had no known abnormalities in hearing, suggesting that musical hallucinations could arise from a variety of sources including psychiatric illnesses. After a complete course of ECT, her hallucinations dissipated, also suggesting that they can be acute.&lt;ref name="Janaki"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Janakiraman |first=R |author2=Wildgoose, K |author3=Seelam, K  |title=ECT associated musical hallucinations in an elderly patient: a case report |journal=Annals of General Psychiatry |year=2006 |volume=5 |pages=10 |pmid=16889667 |doi=10.1186/1744-859X-5-10 |pmc=1557851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Evers and Ellgers, some other major psychiatric disorders that contribute to musical hallucinations include [[schizophrenia]] and depression. Some patients who have schizophrenia experience musical hallucinations due to their ongoing psychosis, but there are some cases that do so without psychosis. There are also a very small percentage of musical hallucination cases due to [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD).&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;

=== Focal brain lesions ===
Among the handful of cases that Evers and Ellgers studied, major lesion sites included the temporal cortex; however, the specific location and laterality (left vs. right temporal cortex) was variable. Many cases of focal brain lesions had comorbidity with hearing impairment (see hypoacusis), epileptic activity and intoxication.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; There have also been several findings of acute musical hallucinations in patients with dorsal [[pons]] lesions post-stroke and [[encephalitis]] potentially due to disruption of connections between the [[sensory cortex]] and [[reticular formation]].&lt;ref name="Schielke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schielke |first=E |author2=Reuter, U |author3=Hoffmann, O |author4= Weber, JR  |title=Musical hallucinations with dorsal pontine lesions |journal=Neurology |year=2000 |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=454–5 |pmid=10932294 |doi=10.1212/wnl.55.3.454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Epilepsy ===
Epileptic brain activity in musical hallucinations originates in the left or right temporal lobe.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; In a specific case studied by Williams et al. 2008, a patient who received a left temporal lobectomy in order to treat epilepsy was diagnosed with musical hallucinations post-surgery. The patient also had multiple additional risk factors that could have accounted for the hallucinations including mild neuropsychiatric dysfunction and [[tinnitus]].&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=VG |author2=Tremont, G |author3=Blum, AS  |title=Musical hallucinations after left temporal lobectomy |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology |year=2008 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=38–40 |pmid=18327022 |doi=10.1097/WNN.0b013e318165a9e1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intoxication ===
Intoxication accounts for a small percentage of musical hallucination cases. Intoxication leads to either withdrawal or inflammatory encephalopathy, which are major contributors to musical hallucinations. Some of the drugs that have been found to relate to musical hallucinations include salicylates, benzodiazepines, pentoxifylline, propranolol, clomipramine, amphetamine, quinine, imipramine, a phenothiazine, carbamazepine, marijuana, paracetamol, phenytoin, procaine, and alcohol.  General anesthesia has also been association with musical hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;
In a case study by Gondim et al. 2010, a seventy–seven-year-old woman with [[Parkinson's disease]] (PD) was administered [[amantadine]] after a year of various other antiparkinsonian treatments. Two days into her treatment, she started to experience musical hallucinations, which consisted of four musical pieces. The music persisted until three days after cessation of the drug. Although the patient was taking other medications at the same time, the timing of onset and offset suggested that amantadine either had a synergistic effect with the other drugs or simply caused the hallucinations. Although the case wasn't specific to intoxication, it leads to the idea that persons with PD who are treated with certain drugs can experience musical hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Gondim"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gondim |first1=Francisco de Assis Aquino |last2=Costa |first2=Helida A. |last3=Taunay |first3=Tauily C.D. |last4=de Oliveira |first4=Gisele R. |last5=Ferreira |first5=Jamile Magalhães |last6=Rola |first6=Francisco H. |title=Transient amantadine‑induced musical hallucinations in a patient with Parkinson’s disease |journal=Movement Disorders |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |year=2010 |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1505–1506 |pmid=20629118 |doi=10.1002/mds.22553 |issn=0885-3185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imaging ==
[[Positron emission tomography]] (PET) and [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) show that musical hallucinations activate a wide variety of areas in the brain including the following: auditory areas, [[motor cortex]], visual areas, [[basal ganglia]], [[brainstem]], [[pons]], [[tegmentum]], [[cerebellum]], [[Hippocampus|hippocampi]], [[amygdala]], and peripheral auditory system.&lt;ref name="Sacks" /&gt;

== Treatment ==
To date, there is no successful method of treatment that "cures" musical hallucinations. There have been successful therapies in single cases that have ameliorated the hallucinations. Some of these successes include drugs such as neuroleptics, antidepressants, and certain anticonvulsive drugs. A musical hallucination was alleviated, for example, by antidepressant medications given to patients with depression.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt; Sanchez reported that some authors have suggested that the use of hearing aids may improve musical hallucination symptoms.&lt;ref name="Sanchez" /&gt; They believed that the external environment influences the auditory hallucinations, showing worsening of symptoms in quieter environments than in noisier ones.&lt;ref name="Hammeke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Miller |first=TC |author2=Crosby, TW |title=Musical hallucinations in a deaf elderly patient |journal=Annals of Neurology |date=Mar 1979 |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=301–2 |pmid=443762 |doi=10.1002/ana.410050314}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ross |first=Elliott D. |title=Musical Hallucinations in Deafness |journal=Journal of the American Medical Association |date=1975-02-10 |volume=231 |issue=6 |pages=620 |doi=10.1001/jama.1975.03240180056018 |pmid=1172847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver Sacks' patient, Mrs. O'C, reported being in an "ocean of sound" despite being in a quiet room due to a small thrombosis or infarction in her right temporal lobe. After treatment, Mrs. O'C was relinquished of her musical experience but said that, "I do miss the old songs. Now, with lots of them, I can't even recall them. It was like being given back a forgotten bit of my childhood again." Sacks also reported another elderly woman, Mrs. O'M, who had a mild case of deafness and reported hearing musical pieces. When she was treated with anticonvulsive medications, her musical hallucinations ceased but when asked if she missed them, she said "Not on your life."&lt;ref name="Sacks1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |title=The man who mistook his wife for a hat and other clinical tales |year=1998 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-684-85394-9 |edition=1st Touchstone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History==
According to [[Oliver Sacks]]' ''[[Hallucinations (book)|Hallucinations]]'', the first known medical report of musical hallucinations was published in 1846, by French alienist Jules Baillarger.&lt;ref name="Sacks"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sacks |first=Oliver |title=Hallucinations |year=2012 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn=978-0-307-95724-5 |edition=1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first scientific description of the disorder was reported in the early 1900s. In the last two decades, Berrios has reported case studies in 1990 and 1991 along with Keshavan et al. in 1992. Berrios concluded that confirmed diagnoses of deafness, ear disease, brain disease, advanced age and drug use are all important factors in the development of musical hallucinations. After analyzing 46 cases, Berrios found a female predominance of 80% in women over the age of 60. The study concluded that musical hallucinations were more likely to be seen in elderly women affected by deafness or brain disease than in individuals with no psychiatric illness at all.&lt;ref name ="Berrios"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Berrios |first=GE |title=Musical hallucinations. A historical and clinical study |journal=British Journal of Psychiatry |year=1990 |volume=156 |issue=2 |pages=188–94 |pmid=2180526 |doi=10.1192/bjp.156.2.188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keshavan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Keshavan |first=M.S. |author2=David, A.S. |author3=Steingard, S. |author4=Lishman, W.A.  |title=Musical hallucinations: a review and synthesis |journal=Cognitive and Behavioral Neurology |year=1992 |volume=3 |issue=3 |pages=211–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keshevan and Berrios were the first authors to identify classes of musical hallucinations. These classes consisted of hearing loss, coarse brain disease (i.e. tumors), [[epilepsy|epileptic disorder]], [[stroke]], and psychiatric disorder. Although no statistical analyses were performed, the authors stated that deafness was the most strongly related factor in musical hallucinations and that there was a female predominance, which could entail a genetic component.&lt;ref name="Evers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Berrios" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Keshavan" /&gt;

*Many mycotrophs have a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] association with fungi in any of several forms of '''[[mycorrhiza]]'''. The majority of plant species are mycotrophic in this sense. Examples include [[Burmanniaceae]].
*Some mycotrophs are [[parasitism|parasitic]] upon fungi in an association known as '''[[myco-heterotrophy]]'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24974">'''Narrative inquiry''' or '''narrative analysis''' emerged as a discipline from within the broader field of [[qualitative research]] in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C. K., 1993. "Narrative Analysis" (Newbury Park: Sage Publications).&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative inquiry uses field texts, such as stories, autobiography, journals, field notes, letters, conversations, [[interview]]s, family stories, photos (and other artifacts), and life experience, as the units of analysis to research and understand the way people create meaning in their lives as [[narratives]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Jean Clandinin and F. Michael Connelly, Narrative Inquiry: Experience and Story in Qualitative Research (San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers, 2000), 98–115.&lt;/ref&gt;

Narrative inquiry has been employed as a tool for analysis in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[organizational studies]], [[knowledge]] theory, [[sociology]], [[occupational science]] and [[education]] studies, among others. Other approaches include the development of [[quantitative methods]] and tools based on the large volume capture of fragmented anecdotal material, and that which is self signified or indexed at the point of capture.&lt;ref&gt;Snowden D (2010) Naturalizing Sensemaking' in Mosier and Fischer (eds) Informed by Knowledge: Expert Performance pp 223-234&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative Inquiry challenges the philosophy behind quantitative/grounded data-gathering and questions the idea of “objective” data, however, it has been criticized for not being “theoretical enough."&lt;ref&gt;David M. Boje,'' Narrative Methods for Organizational and Communication Research'' (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 2001), 83, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clandinin and Connelly, 42. See also Laurel Richardson, “Narrative and Sociology,” in ''Representation in Ethnography'', edited by John Van Maanen (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

Narrative inquiry is a form of [[qualitative research]], that emerged in the field of [[management science]] and later also developed in the field of [[knowledge management]], which shares the sphere of [[Information Management]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Harlan Cleveland]], ''The Knowledge Executive: Leadership in an Information Society'' (New York: E. P. Dutton, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus Narrative Inquiry focuses on the organization of human knowledge more than merely the collection and processing of [[data]]. It also implies that knowledge itself is considered valuable and noteworthy even when known by only one person.

[[Knowledge management]] was coined as a discipline in the early 1980s as a method of identifying, representing, sharing, and communicating [[knowledge]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nico Stehr]] and Richard V. Ericson, eds., ''The Culture and Power of Knowledge: Inquiries into Contemporary Societies'' (New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1992); and, [[Fritz Machlup]], ''Knowledge and Knowledge Production'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Knowledge management]] and Narrative Inquiry share the idea of [[Knowledge transfer]], a theory which seeks to transfer unquantifiable elements of knowledge, including [[experience]].  Knowledge, if not communicated, becomes arguably useless, literally unused.

Philosopher [[Andy Clark]] speculates that the ways in which minds deal with [[narrative]] (second-hand information) and [[memory]] (first-hand perception) are cognitively indistinguishable.  Narrative, then, becomes an effective and powerful method of transferring knowledge.

== Narrative ways of knowing ==

[[Narrative]] is a powerful tool in the transfer, or sharing, of knowledge, one that is bound to cognitive issues of [[memory]], constructed memory, and perceived memory. [[Jerome Bruner]] discusses this issue in his 1990 book, ''Acts of Meaning'', where he considers the narrative form as a non-neutral [[rhetorical]] account that aims at “illocutionary intentions,” or the desire to [[communicate]] [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome S. Bruner]], Acts of Meaning (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1990), 85.&lt;/ref&gt;  This technique might be called “[[narrative]]” or defined as a particular branch of [[storytelling]] within the narrative method.  Bruner’s approach places the narrative in time, to “assume an experience of time” rather than just making reference to historical time.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Polkinghorne, ''Narrative Knowing and the Human Sciences'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1988), 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

This narrative approach captures the emotion of the moment described, rendering the event active rather than passive, infused with the latent meaning being communicated by the teller.  Two concepts are thus tied to narrative storytelling: memory and notions of time, both as time as found in the past and time as re-lived in the present.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Jacques Le Goff]], ''History and Memory'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

A narrative method accepts the idea that knowledge can be held in stories that can be relayed, stored, and retrieved.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald E. Fry, ''Appreciative Inquiry and Organizational Transformation: Reports from the Field'' (Westport: CN: Quorum Books, 2002), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
1. '''Develop''' a [[research question]]
*A qualitative study seeks to learn why or how, so the writer’s research must be directed at determining the why and how of the research topic. Therefore, when crafting a research question for a qualitative study, the writer will need to ask a why or how question about the topic.&lt;ref&gt;[[Research question]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
2. '''Select''' or produce raw data 
*The raw data tend to be [[interview]] transcriptions, but can also be the result of field notes compiled during [[participant observation]] or from other forms of data collection that can be used to produce a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, Amanda &amp; Paul Atkinson (1996). "Making Sense of Qualitative Data." Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

3. '''Organize''' data
*According to psychology professor Donald Polkinghorne, the goal of organizing data is to refine the research question and separate irrelevant or redundant information from that which will be eventually analyzed, sometimes referred to as "narrative smoothing."&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative studies in education, Vol. 8, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some approaches to organizing data are as follows: 
:(When choosing a method of organization, one should choose the approach best suited to the research question and the goal of the project. For instance, Gee's method of organization would be best if studying the role language plays in narrative construction whereas Labov's method would more ideal for examining a certain event and its effect on an individual's experiences.)&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis". Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. ''Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology''. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Labov]]'s: Thematic organization&lt;ref&gt;William Labov (1972). Some principles of linguistic methodology. Language in Society, 1, pp 97-120 doi:10.1017/S0047404500006576&lt;/ref&gt; or ''Synchronic Organization''. 
::This method is considered useful for understanding major events in the narrative and the effect those events have on the individual constructing the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The approach utilizes an "evaluation model" that organizes the data into an abstract (What was this about?), an orientation (Who? What? When? Where?), a complication (Then what happened?), an evaluation (So what?), a result (What finally happened?), and a coda (the finished narrative).&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Said narrative elements may not occur in a constant order; multiple or reoccurring elements may exist within a single narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*Polkinghorne's: Chronological Organization or ''Diachronic Organization''
::also related to the sociology of stories approach that focuses on the contexts in which narratives are constructed. This approach attends to the "embodied nature" of the person telling the narrative, the context from which the narrative is created, the relationships between the narrative teller and others within the narrative, historical continuity, and the chronological organization of events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story with a clear beginning, middle, and end is constructed from the narrative data. Polkinghorne makes the distinction between narrative analysis and analysis of narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Narrative analysis utilizes "narrative reasoning" by shaping data in a narrative form and doing an in-depth analysis of each narrative on its own, whereas analysis of narratives utilizes [[paradigmatic]] reasoning and analyzes themes across data that take the form of narratives.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]]'s functional approach focuses on what roles narratives serve for different individuals. In this approach, narratives are viewed as the way in which individuals construct and make sense of reality as well as the ways in which meanings are created and shared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is considered a functional approach to narrative analysis because the emphasis of the analysis is focused on the work that the narrative serves in helping individuals make sense of their lives, particularly through shaping random and chaotic events into a coherent narrative that makes the events easier to handle by giving them meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of this form of analysis is on the interpretations of events related in the narratives by the individual telling the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bruner|first=Jerome|title=The Narrative Construction of Reality|journal=Critical Inquiry|year=1991|volume=18|issue=1|pages=1–21|doi=10.1086/448619}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[James Paul Gee|Gee]]'s approach of structural analysis focuses on the ways in which the narrative is conveyed by the speaker with particular emphasis given to the interaction between speaker and listener.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; In this form of analysis, the language that the speaker uses, the pauses in speech, discourse markers, and other similar structural aspects of speech are the focus. In this approach, the narrative is divided into [[stanzas]] and each stanza is analyzed by itself and also in the way in which it connects to the other pieces of the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Daiute|first=Colette &amp; Cynthia Lightfoot|title=Narrative Analysis: Studying the Development of Individuals in Society|year=2003|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:*[[Jaber F. Gubrium's]] form of narrative ethnography features the storytelling process as much as the story in analyzing narrativity.  Moving from text to field, he and his associate James A. Holstein present an analytic vocabulary and procedural strategies for collecting and analyzing narrative material in everyday contexts, such as families and care settings. In their view, the structure and meaning of texts cannot be understood separate from the everyday contexts of their production.  Their two books--"Analyzing Narrative Reality" and "Varieties of Narrative Analysis" provide dimensions of an institutionally-sensitive, constructionist approach to narrative production.

*There are a multitude of ways of organizing narrative data that fall under narrative analysis; different types of research questions lend themselves to different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C. K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the approach, qualitative researchers organize their data into groups based on various common traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4. '''Interpret''' data
*Some paradigms/theories that can be used to interpret data:

*While interpreting qualitative data, researchers suggest looking for patterns, themes, and regularities as well as contrasts, paradoxes, and irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, A. &amp; Atkinson, P. (1996) Making sense of qualitative data. Thousand Oaks: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 
:(The research question may have to change at this stage if the data does not offer insight to the inquiry.)
 
*The interpretation is seen in some approaches as co-created by not only the interviewer but also with help from the interviewee, as the researcher uses the interpretation given by the interviewee while also constructing their own meaning from the narrative. 
:With these approaches, the researcher should draw upon their own knowledge and the research to label the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Riessman, C.K. (1993). "Narrative Analysis." Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

* According to some qualitative researchers, the goal of data interpretation is to facilitate the interviewee's experience of the story through a narrative form.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8, Issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Narrative forms are produced by constructing a coherent story from the data and looking at the data from the perspective of one's research question.&lt;ref&gt;Polkinghorne, Donald E. (1995). Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative studies in education, Vol. 8, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretive research ==
The idea of imagination is where narrative inquiry and [[storytelling]] converge within narrative methodologies. Within narrative inquiry, storytelling seeks to better understand the “why” behind human action.&lt;ref&gt;Nona Lyons and Vicki Kubler LaBoskey, ''Narrative Inquiry in Practice: Advancing the Knowledge of Teaching'' (New York: Teachers College Press, 2002), 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Story collecting as a form of narrative inquiry allows the research participants to put the [[data]] into their own words and reveal the latent “why” behind their assertions.

“[[Interpretive research]]” is a form of field research methodology that also searches for the subjective "why."&lt;ref&gt;H. Klein and M. D. Myers, “A Set of Principles for Conducting and Evaluating Interpretive Field Studies” ''MIS Quarterly'' 23, no. 1 (1999): 67–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretive research, using methods such as those termed “storytelling” or “narrative inquiry,” does not attempt to predefine [[independent variables]] and [[dependent variables]], but acknowledges context and seeks to “understand phenomena through the meanings that people assign to them.”&lt;ref&gt;Heinz K. Klein and Michael D. Myers, “A Set of Principles for Conducting and Evaluating Interpretive Field Studies in Information Systems,” ''MIS Quarterly'' 23, no. 1 (March 1999): 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two influential proponents of a narrative research model are [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]]. In his work on experiential, embodied metaphors, Johnson encourages the researcher to challenge “how you see knowledge as embodied, embedded in a culture based on narrative unity,” the “construct of continuity in individual lives.”&lt;ref&gt;Clandinin and Connelly, ''Narrative Inquiry'', 3. See also George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, ''Metaphors We Live By'' (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1980).&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven “functions of narrative work” as outlined by Riessman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riessman|first1=Catherine|title=Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences|date=2008|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;
1. Narrative constitutes past experiences as it provides ways for individuals to make sense of the past. 
2. Narrators argue with stories.
3. Persuading. Using rhetorical skill to position a statement to make it persuasive/to tell it how it “really” happened. To give it authenticity or ‘truth’.
4. Engagement, keeping the audience in the dynamic relationship with the narrator. 
5. Entertainment.
6. Stories can function to mislead an audience.
7. Stories can mobilize others into action for progressive change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riessman|first1=Catherine|title=Narrative Methods for the Human Sciences|date=2008|publisher=Sage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
Narrative analysis therefore can be used to acquire a deeper understanding of the ways in which a few individuals organize and derive meaning from events&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polkinghorne|first=Donald|title=Narrative Configuration in Qualitative Analysis|journal=Qualitative Studies in Education|year=1995|volume=8|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
. It can be particularly useful for studying the impact of social structures on an individual and how that relates to identity, intimate relationships, and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frost|first=David M.|title=Stigma and Intimacy in Same Sex Relationships: A Narrative Approach|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|year=2011|volume=25|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

*[[Feminist]] scholars have found narrative analysis useful for data collection of perspectives that have been traditionally [[marginalized]]. The method is also appropriate to [[cross-cultural]] research.  As Michael Brecher and Frank P. Harvey advocate, when asking unusual questions it is logical to ask them in an unusual manner.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Brecher and Frank P. Harvey (2002). ''Millennial Reflections on International Studies'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press), 326.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Developmental Psychology]] utilizes narrative inquiry to depict a child's experiences in areas such as self-regulation, problem-solving and development of self.&lt;ref&gt;Smith C.P. (2000). Content analysis and narrative analysis. In: Reis HT, Judd CM, eds. Handbook of research methods in social and personality psychology. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Personality uses the narrative approach in order to illustrate an individual's identity over a lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;McAdams, D.P. &amp; Zeldow, P.B. (1993). Construct validity and content analysis. Journal of Personality Assessment, 61. 243-245.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social movements have used narrative analysis in their persuasive techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Donald E. Polkinghorne (1995). Narrative configuration in qualitative analysis. Qualitative Studies in Education, Vol. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Political practices. Stories are connected to the flow of power in the wider world. Some narratives serve different purposes for individuals and others, for groups. Some narratives overlap both individual experiences and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leave|first1=Patricia|title=Method Meets Art: Arts Based Research Practice|date=2009|publisher=Guliford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Promulgation of a culture: Narratives and storytelling are used to remember past events, reveal morals, entertain, relate to one another, and engage a community. Narrative inquiry helps to create an identity and demonstrate/carry on cultural values/traditions. Stories connect humans to each other and to their culture. These cultural definitions aid to make social knowledge accessible to people who are unfamiliar with the culture/situation. An example of this is how children in a given society learn from their parents and the culture around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leave|first1=Patricia|title=Method Meets Art: Arts Based Research Practice|date=2009|publisher=Guliford Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neuroethics''' refers to two related fields of study: what the philosopher Adina Roskies has called the ethics of neuroscience, and the neuroscience of ethics.&lt;ref name=roskies&gt;{{cite journal | author = Roskies A | year = 2002 | title = Neuroethics for the New Millenium | url = | journal = Neuron | volume = 35 | issue = | pages = 21–23 | doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)00763-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethics of neuroscience comprises the bulk of work in neuroethics.  It concerns the ethical, legal and social impact of neuroscience, including the ways in which neurotechnology can be used to predict or alter human behavior and "the implications of our mechanistic understanding of brain function for society... integrating neuroscientific knowledge with ethical and social thought".

Some neuroethics problems are not fundamentally different from those encountered in [[bioethics]]. Others are unique to neuroethics because the brain, as the organ of the mind, has implications for broader philosophical problems, such as the nature of [[free will]], [[moral responsibility]], [[self-deception]], and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;Farah Martha J., Neuroethics: An Introduction with Readings, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of neuroethics topics are given later in this article ("[[#Key issues|Key issues in neuroethics]]").

The origin of the term "neuroethics" has occupied some writers. Rees and Rose (as cited in "References" on page 9) claim ''neuroethics'' is a [[neologism]] that emerged only at the beginning of the 21st century, largely through the [[Speech communication|oral]] and [[Writing|written]] [[communication]]s of [[ethicist]]s and [[philosopher]]s.  According to Racine (2010), the term was coined by the Harvard physician Anneliese A. Pontius in 1973 in a paper entitled "Neuro-ethics of 'walking' in the newborn" for the ''Perceptual and Motor Skills''. The author reproposed the term in 1993 in her paper for ''Psychological Report'', often wrongly mentioned as the first title containing the word "neuroethics". Before 1993, the American neurologist Ronald Cranford has used the term (see Cranford 1989).  Illes (2003) records uses, from the scientific literature, from 1989 and 1991.  Writer [[William Safire]] is widely credited with giving the word its current meaning in 2002, defining it as "the examination of what is right and wrong, good and bad about the treatment of, perfection of, or unwelcome invasion of and worrisome manipulation of the human brain".&lt;ref&gt;Safire, W. Visions for a New Field of "Neuroethics" Neuroethics Mapping the Field Conference Proceedings. May 13–14, 2002. San Francisco, California&lt;/ref&gt;

==Two categories of problems==
Neuroethics encompasses the myriad ways in which developments in basic and clinical neuroscience intersect with social and ethical issues. The field is so young that any attempt to define its scope and limits now will undoubtedly be proved wrong in the future, as [[neuroscience]] develops and its implications continue to be revealed. At present, however, we can discern two general categories of neuroethical issue: those emerging from what we can do and those emerging from what we know.

In the first category are the ethical problems raised by advances in functional [[neuroimaging]], [[psychopharmacology]], [[brain implants]] and [[Cyborg|brain-machine interfaces]]. In the second category are the ethical problems raised by our growing understanding of the neural bases of behavior, personality, consciousness, and states of spiritual transcendence.

==Historical background and implications of neuroscience ethics==
[[Primitive culture|Primitive]] societies for the most part lacked a system of neuroethics to guide them in facing the problems of mental illness and violence as civilization advanced. [[Trepanning|Trepanation]] led through a tortuous course to "[[psychosurgery]]".&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite book|last=Walker AE, editor|title=A history of neurological surgery|publisher=New York: Hafner Publishing; 1967|pages=1–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Faria part 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faria|first=Miguel A|title=Violence, mental illness, and the brain - A brief history of psychosurgery: Part 1 - From trephination to lobotomy|url=http://surgicalneurologyint.com/surgicalint_articles/violence-mental-illness-and-the-brain-a-brief-history-of-psychosurgery-part-1-from-trephination-to-lobotomy/|journal=Surg Neurol Int |year=2013|volume=4|page=49|accessdate=19 May 2014|doi=10.4103/2152-7806.110146|pmid=23646259|pmc=3640229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basic [[neuroscience]] research and psychosurgery advanced in the first half of the 20th century in tandem, but neuroscience ethics was left behind science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robison|first=RA|author2=Taghva A |author3=Liu CY |author4=Apuzzo ML |title=Surgery of the mind, mood and conscious state: an idea in evolution|journal=World Neurosurg|year=2012|volume=77|issue=5–6|pages=662–686 |doi=10.1016/j.wneu.2012.03.005 |pmid=22446082}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Medical ethics]] in modern societies even in democratic governments, not to mention in [[authoritarian]] ones, has not kept pace with the advances of [[technology]] despite the announced social "progress"; and ethics continues to lag behind [[science]] in dealing with the problem of [[mental illness]] in association with human [[violence]].&lt;ref name="Faria 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faria|first=Miguel A|title=Violence, mental illness, and the brain - A brief history of psychosurgery: Part 2 - From the limbic system and cingulotomy to deep brain stimulation|url=http://surgicalneurologyint.com/surgicalint_articles/violence-mental-illness-and-the-brain-a-brief-history-of-psychosurgery-part-2-from-the-limbic-system-and-cingulotomy-to-deep-brain-stimulation/|journal=Surg Neurol Int |year=2013|volume=4|page=75|accessdate=19 May 2014|doi=10.4103/2152-7806.112825|pmid=23776761|pmc=3683171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Delgado&gt;{{cite book|last=Delgado|first=Jose|title=Physical Control of the Mind: Toward a Psychocivilized Society|date=1986|publisher=Harper and Row|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unprovoked "pathological" aggression persists, reminding us daily that civilization is a step away from relapsing into barbarism. Neuroscience ethics (neuroethics) must keep up with advances in neuroscience research and remain separate from state-imposed mandates to face this challenge.&lt;ref name="Faria 3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faria|first=Miguel A|title=Violence, mental illness, and the brain - A brief history of psychosurgery: Part 3 - From deep brain stimulation to amygdalotomy for violent behavior, seizures, and pathological aggression in humans|journal=Surg Neurol Int |pmc=3740620|pmid=23956934|doi=10.4103/2152-7806.115162|volume=4|year=2013|pages=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent writer on the history of psychosurgery as it relates to neuroethics concludes: "The lessons of history sagaciously reveal wherever the government has sought to alter medical ethics and enforce bureaucratic bioethics, the results have frequently vilified medical care and research. In the 20th century in both the communist [[USSR]] and [[Nazi Germany]], medicine regressed after these authoritarian systems corrupted the ethics of the medical profession and forced it to descend to unprecedented barbarism. The Soviet [[psychiatrists]] and Nazi doctor's dark descent into barbarism was a product of [[physicians]] willingly cooperating with the [[totalitarian state]], purportedly in the name of the "[[Common good|collective good]]", at the expense of their individual patients." This must be kept in mind when establishing new guidelines in neuroscience research and bioethics.&lt;ref name="Faria 3" /&gt;

==Important activity since 2002 ==
There is no doubt that people were thinking and writing about the ethical implications of [[neuroscience]] for many years before the field adopted the label "neuroethics", and some of this work remains of great relevance and value.  However, the early 21st century saw a tremendous surge in interest concerning the ethics of [[neuroscience]], as evidenced by numerous meetings, publications and organizations dedicated to this topic.

In 2002, there were several meetings that drew together neuroscientists and ethicists to discuss neuroethics:  the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] with the journal ''[[Neuron (journal)|Neuron]]'', the [[University of Pennsylvania]], the [[Royal Society]], [[Stanford University]], and the [[Dana Foundation]].  This last meeting was the largest, and resulted in a book, ''Neuroethics: Mapping the Field'', edited by Steven J. Marcus and published by Dana Press.   That same year, the ''Economist'' ran a cover story entitled "Open Your Mind: The Ethics of Brain Science", ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published the article "Emerging ethical issues in neuroscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Farah Martha J | year = 2002 | title = Emerging ethical issues in neuroscience | url =http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v5/n11/full/nn1102-1123.html | journal = Nature Neuroscience | volume = 5 | issue = 11| pages = 1123–129 | doi=10.1038/nn1102-1123| pmid = 12404006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further articles appeared on neuroethics in ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]'', ''Neuron'', and ''[[Brain and Cognition]]''.

Thereafter, the number of neuroethics meetings, symposia and publications continued to grow.  The over 38 000 members of the [[Society for Neuroscience]] recognized the importance of neuroethics by inaugurating an annual "special lecture" on the topic, first given by [[Donald Kennedy]], editor-in-chief of Science Magazine.  Several overlapping networks of scientists and scholars began to coalesce around neuroethics-related projects and themes.  For example, the American Society for Bioethics and Humanities established a Neuroethics Affinity Group, students at the [[London School of Economics]] established the Neuroscience and Society Network linking scholars from several different institutions, and a group of scientists and funders from around the world began discussing ways to support international collaboration in neuroethics through what came to be called the International Neuroethics Network.  Stanford began publishing the monthly Stanford Neuroethics Newsletter, Penn developed the informational website neuroethics.upenn.edu, and the Neuroethics and Law Blog was launched.

Several relevant books were published during this time as well: Sandra Ackerman's ''Hard Science, Hard Choices: Facts, Ethics and Policies Guiding Brain Science Today'' (Dana Press), Michael Gazzaniga's ''The Ethical Brain'' (Dana Press), Judy Illes' edited volume, ''Neuroethics: Defining the Issues in Theory, Practice and Policy'' (both Oxford University Press), [[Dai Rees (scientist)|Dai Rees]] and Steven Rose's edited volume ''The New Brain Sciences: Perils and Prospects'' (Cambridge University Press) and Steven Rose's ''The Future of the Brain'' (Oxford University Press).

2006 marked the founding of the [[International Neuroethics Society|International Neuroethics Society (INS)]] (originally the Neuroethics Society), an international group of scholars, scientists, clinicians, and other professionals who share an interest in the social, legal, ethical and policy implications of advances in neuroscience. The mission of the International Neuroethics Society "is to promote the development and responsible application of neuroscience through interdisciplinary and international research, education, outreach and public engagement for the benefit of people of all nations, ethnicities, and cultures".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Neurogaming: What's Neuroscience and Ethics Got To Do With It?|url=http://www.ethicscenter.net/Neurogaming-November2013|website=The Center for Ethics in Science and Technology|accessdate=28 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809044403/http://www.ethicscenter.net/Neurogaming-November2013|archivedate=9 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first President of the INS was Steven Hyman (2006–2014),  succeeded by [[Barbara Sahakian]] (2014–2016). [[Judy Illes]] is the current President, who like Hyman and Sahakian,  was also a pioneer in the field of neuroethics and a founder member of the INS.

Over the next several years many centers for neurotics were established. A 2014 review of the field lists 31 centers and programs around the world;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buniak|first1=Liana|last2=Darragh|first2=Martina|last3=Giordano|first3=James|title=A four-part working bibliography of neuroethics: part 1: overview and reviews – defining and describing the field and its practices|journal=Philosophy, Ethics, and Humanities in Medicine|date=20 April 2014|volume=9|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1186/1747-5341-9-9|pmid=24885037|pmc=4047768}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of the longest running include the [[Neuroethics Research Unit]] at the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montreal (IRCM), the [[National Core for Neuroethics]] at the University of British Columbia in 2007, the [http://www.potomacinstitute.org/cns/ Center for Neurotechnology Studies] of the [[Potomac Institute for Policy Studies]], the Wellcome Centre for Neuroethics at the [[University of Oxford]]; and the [http://neuroethics.upenn.edu/ Center for Neuroscience &amp; Society] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

==Sources of information==
The books, articles and websites mentioned above are by no means a complete list of good neuroethics information sources.  For example, readings and websites that focus on specific aspects of neuroethics, such as brain imaging or enhancement, are not included.  Nor are more recent sources, such as Walter Glannon's book ''Bioethics and the Brain'' (Oxford University Press) and his reader, entitled Defining Right and Wrong in Brain Science (Dana Press).  We should also here mention a book that was in many ways ahead of its time, Robert Blank's Brain Policy (published in 1999 by Georgetown University Press).  The scholarly literature on neuroethics has grown so quickly that one cannot easily list all of the worthwhile articles, and several journals are now soliciting neuroethics submissions for publication, including the ''American Journal of Bioethics – Neuroscience'', ''BioSocieties'', the ''Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience'', and ''Neuroethics''.  The web now has many sites, blogs and portals offering information about neuroethics.  A list can be found at the end of this entry.

==Key issues==
Neuroethics encompasses a wide range of issues, which can only be sampled here.&lt;ref name="LeefmannLevallois2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leefmann|first1=Jon|last2=Levallois|first2=Clement|last3=Hildt|first3=Elisabeth|title=Neuroethics 1995–2012. A Bibliometric Analysis of the Guiding Themes of an Emerging Research Field|journal=Frontiers in Human Neuroscience|volume=10|pages=336|year=2016|issn=1662-5161|doi=10.3389/fnhum.2016.00336|pmid=27445772|pmc=4929847}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have close ties to traditional biomedical ethics, in that different versions of these issues can arise in connection with organ systems other than the brain.  For example, how should incidental findings be handled when a presumed healthy research subject is scanned for neuroscience research and the scan reveals an abnormality?  How safe are the drugs used to enhance normal brain function?  These are neuroethical issues with clear precedents in traditional bioethics.  They are important issues, and luckily we can call upon society's experience with the relevant precedents to help determine the best courses of action in the present cases.  In contrast, many neuroethical issues are at least partly novel, and this accounts for some of the intellectual fascination of neuroethics.  These relatively newer issues force us to think about the relation between mind and brain and its ethical implications.

===Brain interventions===
The ethics of neurocognitive enhancement, that is the use of drugs and other brain interventions to make normal people "better than well", is an example of a neuroethical issue with both familiar and novel aspects.  On the one hand, we can be informed by previous bioethical work on physical enhancements such as [[Doping in sport|doping for strength in sports]] and the use of [[Growth hormone treatment|human growth hormone for normal boys of short stature]].  On the other hand, there are also some arguably novel ethical issues that arise in connection with brain enhancement, because these enhancements affect how people think and feel, thus raising the relatively new issues of "[[cognitive liberty]]".  The growing role of [[psychopharmacology]] in everyday life raises a number of ethical issues, for example the influence of drug marketing on our conceptions of mental health and [[Normality (behavior)|normalcy]], and the increasingly malleable sense of [[personal identity]] that results from what [[Peter D. Kramer]] called "cosmetic psychopharmacology".

Nonpharmacologic methods of altering brain function are currently enjoying a period of rapid development, with a resurgence of [[psychosurgery]] for the treatment of medication refractory mental illnesses and promising new therapies for neurological and psychiatric illnesses based on [[deep brain stimulation]] as well as relatively noninvasive [[transcranial stimulation (disambiguation)|transcranial stimulation]] methods.  Research on brain-machine interfaces is primarily in a preclinical phase but promises to enable thought-based control of computers and robots by paralyzed patients.  As the tragic history of [[frontal lobotomy]] reminds us, permanent alteration of the brain cannot be undertaken lightly.  Although nonpharmacologic brain interventions are exclusively aimed at therapeutic goals, the US military sponsors research in this general area (and more specifically in the use of [[transcranial direct current stimulation]]) that is presumably aimed at enhancing the capabilities of soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neurostimulation Devices for Cognitive Enhancement: Toward a Comprehensive Regulatory Framework|date=1 August 2015|journal=Neuroethics|volume=8|issue=2|pages=115–126|author=Dubljevic, V.|doi=10.1007/s12152-014-9225-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brain imaging===
In addition to the important issues of safety and incidental findings, mentioned above, some arise from the unprecedented and rapidly developing ability to correlate brain activation with psychological states and traits. One of the most widely discussed new applications of imaging is based on correlations between brain activity and [[Lie|intentional deception]]. Intentional deception can be thought of in the context of a [[Polygraph|lie detector]]. This means that scientists use brain imaging to look at certain parts of the brain during moments when a person is being deceptive. A number of different research groups have identified [[fMRI]] correlates of intentional deception in laboratory tasks, and despite the skepticism of many experts, the technique has already been commercialized.  A more feasible application of brain imaging is "[[neuromarketing]]", whereby people's conscious or unconscious reaction to certain products can purportedly be measured.

Researchers are also finding brain imaging correlates of myriad psychological traits, including personality, intelligence, mental health vulnerabilities, attitudes toward particular ethnic groups, and predilection for violent crime.  Unconscious racial attitudes may be manifest in brain activation.  These capabilities of brain imaging, actual and potential, raise a number of ethical issues.  The most obvious concern involves [[privacy]].  For example, employers, marketers, and the government all have a strong interest in knowing the abilities, personality, truthfulness and other mental contents of certain people.  This raises the question of whether, when, and how to ensure the [[Privacy laws of the United States#Intrusion of solitude and seclusion|privacy of our own minds]].

Another ethical problem is that brain scans are often viewed as more accurate and objective than in fact they are.  Many layers of signal processing, statistical analysis and interpretation separate imaged brain activity from the psychological traits and states inferred from it.  There is a danger that the public (including judges and juries, employers, insurers, etc.) will ignore these complexities and treat brain images as a kind of indisputable truth.

A related misconception is called neuro-realism:  In its simplest form, this line of thought says that something is real because it can be measured with electronic equipment.  A person who claims to have pain, or low libido, or unpleasant emotions is "really" sick if these symptoms are supported by a brain scan, and healthy or normal if correlates cannot be found in a brain scan.&lt;ref name=Gordijn&gt;{{cite book

===Memory dampening===
While complete memory erasure is still an element of science-fiction, certain neurological  drugs have been proven to dampen the strength and emotional association of a memory. Propranolol, an FDA-approved drug, has been suggested to effectively dull the painful effects of traumatic memories if taken within 6 hours after the event occurs. This has begun the discussion of ethical implications, assuming the technology for memory erasure will only improve.
Originally, propranolol was reserved for hypertension patients. However, doctors are permitted to use the drug for off-label purposes—leading to the question of whether they actually ''should''. There are numerous reasons for skepticism; for one, it may prevent us from coming to terms with traumatic experiences, it may tamper with our identities and lead us to an artificial sense of happiness, demean the genuineness of human life, and/or encourage some to forget memories they are morally obligated to keep. Whether or not it is ethical to fully or partially erase the memory of a patient, it is certainly becoming a more relevant topic as this technology improves in our society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farah|first1=Martha|title=Neuroethics: an introduction withreadings|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press|isbn=9780262062695|pages=97–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stem cell therapy===

Most of the issues concerning uses of [[stem cell]]s in the brain are the same as any of the bioethical or purely ethical questions you will find regarding the use and research of stem cells. The field of stem cell research is a very new field which poses many ethical questions concerning the allocation of stem cells as well as their possible uses.  Since most stem cell research is still in its preliminary phase most of the neuroethical issues surrounding stem cells are the same as [[Stem cell controversy|stem cell ethics]] in general.

More specifically the way that stem cell research has been involved in neuroscience is through the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and brain tumors. In these cases scientists are using [[neural stem cell]]s to regenerate tissue and to be used as carriers for [[gene therapy]]. In general, neuroethics revolves around a cost benefit approach to find techniques and technologies that are most beneficial to patients. There has been progress in certain fields that have been shown to be beneficial when using stem cells to treat certain neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid = 21371482|pmc = 3087494|year = 2011|last1 = Vaccarino|first1 = F. M.|title = Induced pluripotent stem cells: A new tool to confront the challenge of neuropsychiatric disorders|journal = Neuropharmacology|volume = 60|issue = 7–8|pages = 1355–63|last2 = Stevens|first2 = H.

A study done in 2011 showed that [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPSCs) can be used to aid in Parkinson's research and treatment. The cells can be used to study the progression of Parkinson's as well as used in regenerative treatment. Animal studies have shown that the use of iPSCs can improve motor skills and dopamine release of test subjects with Parkinson's. This study shows a positive outcome in the use of stem cells for neurological purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=L W|author2=F Kuang |author3=L C Wei |author4=Y X Ding |author5=K K L Yung |author6=Y S Chan |title=Potential application of induced pluripotent stem cells in cell replacement therapy for Parkinson's disease|journal=CNS &amp; Neurological Disorders Drug Targets|date=Jun 2011|volume=10|issue=4|pages=449–458|pmid=21495962|doi=10.2174/187152711795563994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another study done in 2011 used stem cells to treat [[cerebral palsy]]. This study, however, was not as successful as the Parkinson's treatment. In this case stem cells were used to treat animal models who had been injured in a way that mimicked CP. This brings up a neuroethical issue of animal models used in science. Since most of their "diseases" are inflicted and do not occur naturally, they can not always be reliable examples of how a person with the actual disease would respond to treatment. The stem cells used did survive implantation, but did not show significant nerve regeneration. However, studies are ongoing in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Emily|author2=Isabelle Chouinard |author3=Michael Shevell |author4=Eric Racine |title=Responding to requests of families for unproven interventions in neurodevelopmental disorders: hyperbaric oxygen "treatment" and stem cell "therapy" in cerebral palsy.|journal=Developmental Disabilities Research Reviews|year=2011|volume=17|issue=1|pages=19–26|doi=10.1002/ddrr.134|pmid=22447751}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As discussed, stem cells are used to treat degenerative diseases. One form of a degenerative disease that can occur in the brain as well as throughout the body is an [[autoimmune disease]]. Autoimmune diseases cause the body to "attack" its own cells and therefore destroys those cells as well as whatever functional purpose those cells have or contribute to. One form of an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system is [[multiple sclerosis]]. In this disease the body attacks the [[glial cells]] that form myelin coats around the axons on neurons. This causes the nervous system to essentially "short circuit" and pass information very slowly. Stem cells therapy has been used to try to cure some of the damage caused by the body in MS. [[Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] has been used to try and cure MS patients by essentially "reprogramming" their immune system. The main risk encountered with this form of treatment is the possibility of rejection of the stem cells. If the hematopoetic stem cells can be harvested from the individual, risk of rejection is much lower. But, there can be the risk of those cells being programmed to induce MS. However, if the tissue is donated from another individual there is high risk of rejection leading to possibly fatal toxicity in the recipient's body. Considering that there are fairly good treatments for MS, the use of stem cells in this case may have a higher cost than the benefits they produce. However, as research continues perhaps stem cells will truly become a viable treatment for MS as well as other autoimmune diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Silani|first=Vincenzo|author2=Lidia Cova|title=Stem cell transplantation in Multiple Sclerosis: Safety and Ethics|journal=Journal of the Neurological Sciences|date=15 February 2008|volume=265|issue=1–2|pages=116–121|doi=10.1016/j.jns.2007.06.010|pmid=17619025|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022510X07004066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are just some examples of neurological diseases in which stem cell treatment has been researched. In general, the future looks promising for stem cell application in the field of neurology. However, possible complications lie in the overall ethics of stem cell use, possible recipient rejection, as well as over-proliferation of the cells causing possible brain tumors. Ongoing research will further contribute in the decision of whether stem cells should be used in the brain and whether their benefits truly outweigh their costs.

The primary ethical dilemma that is brought up in stem cell research is concerning the source of [[embryonic stem cells]] (hESCs). As the name states, hESCs come from embryos. To be more specific, they come from the [[inner cell mass]] of a blastophere, which is the beginning stage of an embryo. However, that mass of cells could have the potential to give rise to human life, and there in lies the problem. Often, this argument leads back to a similar moral debate held around abortion. The question is: when does a mass of cells gain personhood and autonomy?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barker|first=Roger A|author2=Inez de Beaufort|title=Scientific and ethical issues related to stem cell research and interventions in neurodegenerative disorders of the brain|journal=Progress in Neurobiology|date=November 2013|volume=110|pages=63–73|doi=10.1016/j.pneurobio.2013.04.003|pmid=23665410}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals believe that an embryo is in fact a person at the moment of conception and that using an embryo for anything other than creating a baby would essentially be killing a baby. On the other end of the spectrum, people argue that the small ball of cells at that point only has the potential to become a fetus, and that potentiality, even in natural conception, is far from guaranteed. According to a study done by developmental biologists, between 75–80% of embryos created through intercourse are naturally lost before they can become fetuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyun|first=Insoo|title=The bioethics of stem cell research and therapy|journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=4 January 2010|volume=120|issue=1|pages=71–75|doi=10.1172/jci40435|pmid=20051638|pmc=2798696}}&lt;/ref&gt; This debate is not one that has a right or wrong answer, nor can it be clearly settled.  Much of the ethical dilemma surrounding hESCs relies on individual beliefs about life and the potential for scientific advancement versus creating new human life.

=== Disorders of consciousness ===

Patients in coma, vegetative, or minimally conscious state pose ethical challenges. The patients are unable to respond, therefore the assessment of their needs can only be approached by adopting a third person perspective. They are unable to communicate their pain levels, quality of life, or end of life preferences. Neuroscience and brain imaging have allowed us to explore the brain activity of these patients more thoroughly. Recent findings from studies using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] have changed the way we view vegetative patients. The images have shown that aspects emotional processing, language comprehension and even conscious awareness might be retained in patients whose behavior suggests a vegetative state. If this is the case, it is unethical to allow a third party to dictate the life and future of the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bruno|first=Marie-Aurélie|author2=Steven Laureys|title=Coma and disorders of consciousness|journal=Handbook of Clinical Neurology|year=2013|volume=118|pages=205–213|doi=10.1016/b978-0-444-53501-6.00017-2|pmid=24182379|isbn=9780444535016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, defining death is an issue that comes with patients with severe traumatic brain injuries. The decision to withdraw life-sustaining care from these patients can be based on uncertain assessments about the individual's conscious awareness. Case reports have shown that these patients in a persistent vegetative state can recover unexpectedly. This raises the ethical question about the premature termination of care by physicians. The hope is that one day, neuroimaging technologies can help us to define these different states of consciousness and enable us to communicate with patients in vegetative states in a way that was never before possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Catherine|first=Rodrigue|title=Perspectives and Experience of Healthcare Professionals on Diagnosis, Prognosis, and End-of-Life Decision Making in Patients with Disorders of Consciousness|journal=Neuroethics|date=2013-04-01|volume=6|issue=1|pages=25–36|doi=10.1007/s12152-011-9142-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fins|first=Joseph J.|title=Neuroethics, Neuroimaging, and Disorders of Consciousness: Promise or Peril?|journal=Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association|year=2011|volume=122|pages=336–346|pmc=3116331|pmid=21686236}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clinical translation of these advanced technologies is of vital importance for the medical management of these challenging patients. In this situation, neuroscience has both revealed ethical issues and possible solutions.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aggarwal|first=Neil Krishan|author2=Elizabeth Ford|title=The Neuroethics and Neurolaw of Brain Injury|journal=Behavioral Sciences &amp; the Law|year=2013|doi=10.1002/bsl.2086|pmid=24123245|volume=31|issue=6|pages=789–802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmacological enhancement===
Cosmetic neuro-pharmacology, the use of drugs to improve cognition in normal healthy individuals, is highly controversial. Some case reports with the antidepressant [[Prozac]] indicated that patients seemed "better than well", and authors hypothesized that this effect might be observed in individuals not afflicted with psychiatric disorders. Following these case reports much controversy arose over the veracity and ethics of the cosmetic use of these antidepressants.  Opponents of [[cosmetic pharmacology]] believe that such drug usage is unethical and that the concept of cosmetic pharmacology is a manifestation of naive consumerism. Proponents, such as philosopher [[Arthur Caplan]], state that it is an individual's (rather than government's, or physician's) right to determine  whether to use a drug for cosmetic purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Caplan, Arthur.  Is Better Best?  A Noted Ethicist Argues in Favor of Brain Enhancement.  Scientific American.  September, 2003.  Pages 04-05&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anjan Chatterjee]], a neurologist at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], has argued that western medicine stands on the brink of a neuro-enhancement revolution in which people will be able to improve their memory and attention through pharmacological means.  Jacob Appel, a Brown University bioethicist, has raised concerns about the possibility of employers mandating such enhancement for their workers.&lt;ref&gt;J M Appel  When the boss turns pusher: a proposal for employee protections in the age of cosmetic neurology  J Med Ethics 2008; 34: 616-618&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jason Kirby.

===Politics of neuromarketing===
The politics of neuromarketing is this idea of using advertisements to convince the mind of a voter to vote for a certain party. This has already been happening within the elections throughout the years. In the 2006 reelection of Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], he was double digits off in the voting in comparison to his Democratic opponent. However, Schwarzenegger's theme in this campaign was whether or not the voters would want to continue Schwarzenegger's reforms or go back to the days of the recalled governor, [[Gray Davis]]. In normal marketing, voters would use "detail, numbers, facts and figures to prove we were better off under the new governor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.campaignsandelections.com/magazine/2306/the-power-of-neuromarketing|title=The power of neuromarketing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with neuromarketing, voters followed powerful advertisement visuals and used these visuals to convince themselves that Schwarzenegger was the better candidate. Now, with political neuromarketing, there exists a lot of controversy. The ethics behind political neuromarketing are debatable. Some argue that political neuromarketing will cause voters to make rash decisions while others argue that these messages are beneficial because they depict what the politicians can do. However, control over political decisions could make voters not see the reality of things. Voters may not look into the details of the reforms, personality, and morality each person brings to their political campaign and may be swayed by how powerful the advertisements seem to be. However, there are also people that may disagree with this idea. Darryl Howard, "a consultant to two Republican winners on November 2, says he crafted neuromarketing-based messages for TV, direct mail and speeches for Senate, Congressional and [[Governor (United States)|Gubernatorial]] clients in 2010". He says that these advertisements that were presented, show honesty and continues to say how he and other politicians decide which advertisements are the most effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.upperplayground.com/tag/darryl-howard|title=Upper Playground - darryl-howard|website=news.upperplayground.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurological treatments ===

Neuroscience has led to a deeper understanding of the chemical imbalances present in a disordered brain. In turn, this has resulted in the creation of new treatments and medications to treat these disorders. When these new [[Clinical trial|treatments are first being tested]], the experiments prompt ethical questions. First, because the treatment is affecting the brain, the side effects can be unique and sometimes severe. A special kind of side effect that many subjects have claimed to experience in neurological treatment tests is changes in "[[personal identity]]". Although this is a difficult ethical dilemma because there are no clear and undisputed definitions of personality, self, and identity, neurological treatments can result in patients losing parts of "themselves" such as memories or moods. Yet another ethical dispute in neurological treatment research is the [[Triage|choice of patients]]. From a perspective of justice, priority should be given to those who are most seriously impaired and who will benefit most from the intervention. However, in a test group, scientists must select patients to secure a favorable risk-benefit ratio. Setting priority becomes more difficult when a patient's chance to benefit and the seriousness of their impairment do not go together. For example, many times an older patient will be excluded despite the seriousness of their disorder simply because they are not as strong or as likely to benefit from the treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mohamed|first=Ahmed D.|author2=Barbara J. Sahakian|title=The ethics of elective psychopharmacology|journal=The International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology|year=2012|volume=15|issue=4|pages=559–571|doi=10.1017/s146114571100037x|pmid=21396152|pmc=3325502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main ethical issue at the heart of neurological treatment research on human subjects is promoting high-quality scientific research in the interest of future patients, while at the same time respecting and guarding the rights and interests of the research subjects. This is particularly difficult in the field of [[neurology]] because damage to the brain is often permanent and will change a patient's way of life forever.

===Neuroscience and free will===
Neuroethics also encompasses the ethical issues raised by neuroscience as it affects our understanding of the world and of ourselves in the world.  For example, if everything we do is physically caused by our brains, which are in turn a product of our genes and our life experiences, how can we be held responsible for our actions?  A [[crime]] in the United States requires a "[[Actus reus|guilty act]]" and a "[[Mens rea|guilty mind]]". As [[neuropsychiatry]] evaluations have become more commonly used in the criminal justice system and [[neuroimaging]] technologies have given us a more direct way of viewing brain injuries, scholars have cautioned that this could lead to the inability to hold anyone criminally responsible for their actions. In this way, neuroimaging evidence could suggest that there is no free will and each action a person makes is simply the product of past actions and biological impulses that are out of our control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neuroscience, Neuropolitics and Neuroethics: The Complex Case of Crime, Deception and fMRI - Springer|journal=Neuroscience, Neuropolitics and Neuroethics| doi=10.1007/s11948-012-9393-4|pmid=23054671|volume=18|issue=3|pages=573–591|year=2012|last1=Henry|first1=Stuart|last2=Plemmons|first2=Dena}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of whether and how personal [[autonomy]] is compatible with neuroscience ethics and the responsibility of neuroscientists to society and the state is a central one for neuroethics.&lt;ref name="Aggarwal 2013"/&gt; However, there is some controversy over whether autonomy entails the concept of 'free will' or is a 'moral-political' principle separate from metaphysical quandaries.&lt;ref&gt;Dubljevic, V. 2013: Autonomy in Neuroethics: Political and not metaphysical, AJOB-Neuroscience 4(4):44-51 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21507740.2013.819390&lt;/ref&gt;
In late 2013 U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] made recommendations to the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues as part of his $100 million Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative. This Spring discussion resumed in a recent interview and article sponsored by [[Agence France-Presse (AFP)]]: "It is absolutely critical... to integrate ethics from the get-go into neuroscience research," and not "for the first time after something has gone wrong", said [[Amy Gutmann]], Bioethics Commission Chair."&lt;ref name=AFP /&gt; But no consensus has been reached. [[Miguel Faria]], a Professor of Neurosurgery and an Associate Editor in Chief of [[Surgical Neurology International]], who was not involved in the Commission's work said, "any ethics approach must be based upon respect for the individual, as doctors pledge according to the [[Hippocratic Oath]] which includes vows to be humble, respect privacy and doing no harm; and pursuing a path based on population-based ethics is just as dangerous as having no medical ethics at all".&lt;ref name="Faria Hacienda"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Faria, Miguel A  |author2=Sheridan, Kerry|title=Medical Ethics of Hippocrates or Population-Based Bioethics — A Symposium|url=http://www.haciendapub.com/articles/medical-ethics-hippocrates-or-population-based-bioethics-%E2%80%94-symposium-based-interview-dr-mig#comment-1065|publisher=Hacienda Publishing|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Why the danger of population-based bioethics?&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheridan|first=Kerry|title=U.S. Experts urge focus on ethics in brain research|url=https://news.yahoo.com/us-experts-urge-focus-ethics-brain-research-151243732.html%20;_ylt=A0LEVxPMjnNTmA0AsK5XNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTB0MnRoNXFhBHNlYwNzYwRjb2xvA2JmMQR2dGlk%20A1NNRTM0Nl8x|publisher=Yahoo News.

'''New media''' are forms of media that are native to computers, computational and relying on computers for redistribution. Some examples of new media are [[telephone]]s, [[computer]]s, [[virtual world]]s, [[single media]], [[website games]], [[Human–computer interaction|human-computer interface]], [[computer animation]] and [[New media art|interactive computer installations]].&lt;ref name="Manovich" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://aaltodoc.aalto.fi/handle/123456789/11661|title=Designing Learning Tools. Methodological Insights.|last=Leinonen|first=Teemu|publisher=Aalto University School of Art and Design|year=2010|isbn=978-952-60-0031-2|location=Helsinki|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New media are often contrasted to "[[old media]]", such as television, radio, and print media, although scholars in communication and media studies have criticised rigid distinctions based on oldness and novelty. New media does not include [[television program]]s (only analog broadcast), feature films, [[magazine]]s, [[book]]s, &amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; unless they contain technologies that enable digital generative or interactive processes.&lt;ref name="Manovich"&gt;Manovich, Lev. "New Media From Borges to HTML." ''The New Media Reader.'' Ed. Noah Wardrip-Fruin &amp; Nick Montfort. Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2003. 13-25. {{ISBN|0-262-23227-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia, is a good example of New Media, combining [[Internet]] accessible digital text, images and video with web-links, creative participation of contributors, interactive feedback of users and formation of a participant community of editors and donors for the benefit of non-community readers. [[Facebook]] is another type of New Media, belonging to the category of [[social media]] model, in which most users are also participants. Another type of New Media is [[Twitter]] which also belongs to the social media category, through which users interact with one another and make announcements to which the public receive. Both Facebook and Twitter have risen in usage in recent years and have become an online resource for acquiring information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.journalism.org/2015/07/14/the-evolving-role-of-news-on-twitter-and-facebook/|title=The Evolving Role of News on Twitter and Facebook|date=2015-07-14|work=Pew Research Center's Journalism Project|access-date=2017-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1950s, connections between computing and radical art began to grow stronger. It was not until the 1980s that [[Alan Kay]] and his co-workers at [[Xerox PARC]] began to give the [[computability]] of a [[personal computer]] to the individual, rather than have a big organization be in charge of this. "In the late 1980s and early 1990s, however, we seem to witness a different kind of parallel relationship between social changes and [[computer design]]. Although causally unrelated, conceptually it makes sense that the [[Cold War]] and the design of the Web took place at exactly the same time."&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;

Writers and philosophers such as [[Marshall McLuhan]] were instrumental in the development of [[media theory]] during this period. His now famous declaration in ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]'' (1964) that "[[the medium is the message]]" drew attention to the too often ignored influence media and technology themselves, rather than their "content," have on humans' experience of the world and on society broadly.

Until the 1980s [[media (communication)|media]] relied primarily upon print and [[analog signal|analog]] [[broadcast]] models, such as those of [[television]] and [[radio]]. The last twenty-five years have seen the rapid transformation into media which are predicated upon the use of digital technologies, such as the [[Internet]] and [[video game]]s. However, these examples are only a small representation of new media. The use of [[digital computer]]s has transformed the remaining 'old' media, as suggested by the advent of [[digital television]] and [[online publication]]s. Even traditional media forms such as the printing press have been transformed through the application of technologies such as [[image manipulation]] software like [[Adobe Photoshop]] and desktop publishing tools.

[[Andrew L. Shapiro]] (1999) argues that the "emergence of new, digital technologies signals a potentially radical shift of who is in control of information, experience and resources" (Shapiro cited in Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 322). [[W. Russell Neuman]] (1991) suggests that whilst the "new media" have technical capabilities to pull in one direction, economic and social forces pull back in the opposite direction. According to Neuman, "We are witnessing the evolution of a universal interconnected network of audio, video, and electronic text communications that will blur the distinction between interpersonal and mass communication and between public and private communication" (Neuman cited in Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 322). Neuman argues that new media will:
*Alter the meaning of geographic distance.
*Allow for a huge increase in the volume of [[communication]].
*Provide the possibility of increasing the speed of communication.
*Provide opportunities for interactive communication.
*Allow forms of communication that were previously separate to overlap and interconnect.

Consequently, it has been the contention of scholars such as [[Douglas Kellner]] and [[James Bohman]] that new media, and particularly the Internet, provide the potential for a democratic [[postmodern]] public sphere, in which citizens can participate in well informed, non-hierarchical debate pertaining to their social structures. Contradicting these positive appraisals of the potential social impacts of new media are scholars such as Ed Herman and [[Robert D. McChesney|Robert McChesney]] who have suggested that the transition to new media has seen a handful of powerful [[International|transnational]] [[telecommunication]]s corporations who achieve a level of global influence which was hitherto unimaginable.

Scholars, such as Lister et al. (2003), have highlighted both the positive and negative potential and actual implications of new media technologies, suggesting that some of the early work into new media studies was guilty of technological [[determinism]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; whereby the effects of media were determined by the technology themselves, rather than through tracing the complex social networks which governed the development, funding, implementation and future development of any technology.

Based on the argument that people have a limited amount of time to spend on the consumption of different media, Displacement theory argue that the viewership or readership of one particular outlet leads to the reduction in the amount of time spent by the individual on another. The introduction of New Media, such as the internet, therefore reduces the amount of time individuals would spend on existing "Old" Media, which could ultimately lead to the end of such traditional media.&lt;ref name="Dimmick"&gt;Dimmick, J., Chen, Y., &amp; Li, Z. (2004). Competition between the internet and traditional news media: The gratification-opportunities niche dimension. Journal of Media Economics&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Although there are several ways that New Media may be described, Lev Manovich, in an introduction to ''The New Media Reader'', defines New Media by using eight propositions:&lt;ref name="Manovich"/&gt;
#'''New Media versus [[Cyberculture]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Cyberculture is the various social phenomena that are associated with the Internet and network communications (blogs, online multi-player gaming), whereas New Media is concerned more with cultural objects and paradigms (digital to analog television, iPhones).
#'''New Media as Computer Technology Used as a Distribution Platform'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; New Media are the cultural objects which use digital computer technology for distribution and exhibition. e.g. (at least for now) Internet, Web sites, computer multimedia, Blu-ray disks etc. The problem with this is that the definition must be revised every few years. The term "new media" will not be "new" anymore, as most forms of culture will be distributed through computers.
#'''New Media as Digital Data Controlled by Software'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; The language of New Media is based on the assumption that, in fact, all cultural objects that rely on digital representation and computer-based delivery do share a number of common qualities. New media is reduced to digital data that can be manipulated by software as any other data. Now media operations can create several versions of the same object. An example is an image stored as matrix data which can be manipulated and altered according to the additional algorithms implemented, such as color inversion, gray-scaling, sharpening, rasterizing, etc.
#'''New Media as the Mix Between Existing Cultural Conventions and the Conventions of Software'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; New Media today can be understood as the mix between older cultural conventions for data representation, access, and manipulation and newer conventions of data representation, access, and manipulation. The "old" data are representations of visual reality and human experience, and the "new" data is numerical data. The computer is kept out of the key "creative" decisions, and is delegated to the position of a technician. e.g. In film, software is used in some areas of production, in others are created using computer animation.
#'''New Media as the [[Aesthetics]] that Accompanies the Early Stage of Every New Modern Media and Communication Technology'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; While ideological tropes indeed seem to be reappearing rather regularly, many aesthetic strategies may reappear two or three times ... In order for this approach to be truly useful it would be insufficient to simply name the strategies and tropes and to record the moments of their appearance; instead, we would have to develop a much more comprehensive analysis which would correlate the history of technology with social, political, and economical histories or the modern period.
#'''New Media as Faster Execution of [[Algorithms]] Previously Executed Manually or through Other Technologies'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Computers are a huge speed-up of what were previously manual techniques. e.g. calculators. Dramatically speeding up the execution makes possible previously non-existent representational technique. This also makes possible of many new forms of media art such as interactive multimedia and video games. On one level, a modern digital computer is just a faster calculator, we should not ignore its other identity: that of a cybernetic control device.
#'''New Media as the Encoding of Modernist [[Avant-Garde]]; New Media as Metamedia'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Manovich declares that the 1920s are more relevant to New Media than any other time period. [[Metamedia]] coincides with [[postmodernism]] in that they both rework old work rather than create new work. New media avant-garde is about new ways of accessing and manipulating information (e.g. hypermedia, databases, search engines, etc.). Meta-media is an example of how quantity can change into quality as in new media technology and manipulation techniques can recode modernist aesthetics into a very different postmodern aesthetics.
#'''New Media as Parallel Articulation of Similar Ideas in Post-WWII Art and Modern Computing'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Post WWII Art or "combinatorics" involves creating images by systematically changing a single parameter. This leads to the creation of remarkably similar images and spatial structures. This illustrates that algorithms, this essential part of new media, do not depend on technology, but can be executed by humans.

==Globalization==
The rise of new media has increased communication between people all over the world and the Internet. It has allowed people to express themselves through blogs, websites, videos, pictures, and other user-generated media.

[[Terry Flew|Flew]] (2002) stated that, "as a result of the evolution of new media technologies, [[globalization]] occurs." Globalization is generally stated as "more than expansion of activities beyond the boundaries of particular nation states".&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, John B. (1995). ''The Media and Modernity''. Cambridge: Polity Press, pg. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization shortens the distance between people all over the world by the electronic communication (Carely 1992 in Flew 2002) and Cairncross (1998) expresses this great development as the "death of distance". New media "radically break the connection between physical place and social place, making physical location much less significant for our social relationships" (Croteau and Hoynes 2003: 311).

However, the changes in the new media environment create a series of tensions in the concept of "public sphere".&lt;ref&gt;Violaine Hacker, "Building Media's industry while promoting community of values in the globalisation", Politické Vedy, Journal of International Affairs, Policy and Security, 2/2011, http://www.fpvmv.umb.sk/politickevedy&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ingrid Volkmer, "public sphere" is defined as a process through which public communication becomes restructured and partly disembedded from national political and cultural institutions. This trend of the globalized public sphere is not only as a geographical expansion form a nation to worldwide, but also changes the relationship between the public, the media and state (Volkmer, 1999:123).&lt;ref&gt;Volkmer, Ingrid (1999) News in the Global Sphere. A Study of [[CNN]] and its impact on [[Global Communication]], Luton: University of Luton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Virtual communities]]" are being established online and transcend geographical boundaries, eliminating social restrictions.&lt;ref name="DeFleur 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=DeFleur|first=Everette E. Dennis, Melvin L.|title=Understanding media in the digital age : connections for communication, society, and culture|year=2010|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=New York|isbn=0205595820}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard Rheingold]] (2000) describes these globalised societies as self-defined networks, which resemble what we do in real life. "People in virtual communities use words on screens to exchange pleasantries and argue, engage in intellectual discourse, conduct commerce, make plans, brainstorm, gossip, feud, fall in love, create a little high art and a lot of idle talk" (Rheingold cited in Slevin 2000: 91). For [[Sherry Turkle]] "making the computer into a second self, finding a soul in the machine, can substitute for human relationships" (Holmes 2005: 184). New media has the ability to connect like-minded others worldwide.

While this perspective suggests that the technology drives&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; and therefore is a determining factor&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; in the process of globalization, arguments involving [[technological determinism]] are generally frowned upon by mainstream media studies.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond (1974) 'Television: Technology and Cultural Form, London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durham, M &amp; Kellner, Douglas (2001) Media and Cultural Studies Keyworks, Malden, Ma and Oxford, UK, Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lister, Martin, Dovey, Jon, Giddings, Seth. Grant, Iain. &amp; Kelly, Kieran (2003) "New Media: A Critical Introduction", London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; Instead academics focus on the multiplicity of processes by which technology is funded, researched and produced, forming a feedback loop when the technologies are used and often transformed by their users, which then feeds into the process of guiding their future development.

While commentators such as [[Manuel Castells|Castells]]&lt;ref name="Castells, Manuel 1996"&gt;Castells, Manuel, (1996) Rise of the Network Society, The Information Age: Economy, Society and Culture volume 1, Massachusetts, Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; espouse a "soft determinism"&lt;ref&gt;Lister, Martin, Dovey, Jon, Giddins, Seth. Grant, Iain. &amp; Kelly, Kieran (2003) New Media: A Critical Introduction, London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; whereby they contend that "Technology does not determine society. Nor does society script the course of technological change, since many factors, including individual inventiveness and entrpreneurialism, intervene in the process of scientific discovery, technical innovation and social applications, so the final outcome depends on a complex pattern of interaction. Indeed the dilemma of technological determinism is probably a false problem, since technology is society and society cannot be understood without its technological tools." (Castells 1996:5) This, however, is still distinct from stating that societal changes are instigated by technological development, which recalls the theses of [[Marshall McLuhan]].&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1962) The Gutenberg Galaxy: The Making of Typographic Man, London, Routledge and Kegan Paul&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall (1964) Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man, Toronto, McGraw Hill&lt;/ref&gt;

Manovich&lt;ref&gt;Manovich, Lev (2001) ''The Language of New Media'' [[MIT Press]], Cambridge and London&lt;/ref&gt; and Castells&lt;ref name="Castells, Manuel 1996"/&gt; have argued that whereas mass media "corresponded to the logic of industrial mass society, which values conformity over individuality," (Manovich 2001:41) new media follows the logic of the postindustrial or globalized society whereby "every citizen can construct her own custom lifestyle and select her ideology from a large number of choices. Rather than pushing the same objects to a mass audience, marketing now tries to target each individual separately." (Manovich 2001:42).

==As tool for social change==
[[Social movement]] media has a rich and storied history ''(see [[Agitprop]])'' that has changed at a rapid rate since New Media became widely used.&lt;ref name="Atton 2003"&gt;[[Chris Atton|Atton, Chris]] "Reshaping Social Movement Media for a New Millennium." Social Movement Studies, 2, (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]] of [[Chiapas]], Mexico were the first major movement to make widely recognized and effective use of New Media for communiques and organizing in 1994.&lt;ref name="Atton 2003" /&gt; Since then, New Media has been used extensively by social movements to educate, organize, share cultural products of movements, communicate, coalition build, and more. The [[WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protest activity]] was another landmark in the use of New Media as a tool for social change. The WTO protests used media to organize the original action, communicate with and educate participants, and was used as an alternative media source.&lt;ref&gt;Reed, television, "Will the Revolution be Cybercast?"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indymedia]] movement also developed out of this action, and has been a great tool in the democratization of information, which is another widely discussed aspect of new media movement.&lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas, "New Technologies, TechnoCities, and the Prospects for Democratization"&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars even view this democratization as an indication of the creation of a "radical, socio-technical paradigm to challenge the dominant, neoliberal and technologically determinist model of information and communication technologies."&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paschal "Reshaping Communications: Technology, Information and Social Change," London:Sage, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; A less radical view along these same lines is that people are taking advantage of the Internet to produce a grassroots globalization, one that is anti-neoliberal and centered on people rather than the flow of capital.&lt;ref&gt;Kellner, Douglas, "Globalization and Technopolitics"&lt;/ref&gt; Chanelle Adams, a feminist blogger for the Bi-Weekly webpaper The Media says that in her "commitment to anti-oppressive feminist work, it seems obligatory for her to stay in the know just to remain relevant to the struggle."  In order for Adams and other feminists who work towards spreading their messages to the public, new media becomes crucial towards completing this task, allowing people to access a movement's information instantaneously. Of course, some are also skeptical of the role of New Media in Social Movements. Many scholars point out unequal access to new media as a hindrance to broad-based movements, sometimes even oppressing some within a movement.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Herman, "Is a New Worldwide Web Possible? An Explorative Comparison of the Use of ICTs by Two South African Social Movements," African Studies Review, Volume 50, Number 1 (April 2007), pp. 109–131&lt;/ref&gt; Others are skeptical about how democratic or useful it really is for social movements, even for those with access.&lt;ref&gt;Marmura, Stephen, "A net advantage? The Internet, grassroots activism and American Middle-Eastern Policy," New Media Society 2008; 10; 247&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media has also found a use with less radical social movements such as the [[Free Hugs Campaign]]. Using websites, blogs, and online videos to demonstrate the effectiveness of the movement itself. Along with this example the use of high volume blogs has allowed numerous views and practices to be more widespread and gain more public attention. Another example is the ongoing [[Free Tibet Campaign]], which has been seen on numerous websites as well as having a slight tie-in with the band [[Gorillaz]] in their Gorillaz Bitez clip featuring the lead singer [[2D (Gorillaz)|2D]] sitting with protesters at a Free Tibet protest. Another social change seen coming from New Media is trends in fashion and the emergence of subcultures such as [[SMS language|Text Speak]], [[Cyberpunk]], and various others.

Following trends in fashion and [[Text Speak]], New Media also makes way for "trendy" social change. The [[Ice Bucket Challenge]] is a recent example of this. All in the name of raising money for [[ALS]] (the lethal neurodegenerative disorder also known as [[Lou Gehrig's disease]]), participants are nominated by friends via [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and ownmirror to dump a bucket of ice water on themselves, or donate to the ALS Foundation. This became a huge trend through Facebook's tagging tool, allowing nominees to be tagged in the post. The videos appeared on more people's feeds, and the trend spread fast. This trend raised over 100 million dollars for the cause and increased donations by 3,500 percent.

== National security ==
{{See also|Terrorism and social media}}
New Media has also recently become of interest to the global [[espionage]] community as it is easily accessible electronically in [[database]] format and can therefore be quickly retrieved and reverse engineered by national [[governments]]. Particularly of interest to the [[espionage]] community are [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]], two sites where individuals freely divulge personal information that can then be sifted through and archived for the automatic creation of dossiers on both people of interest and the average citizen.&lt;ref&gt;https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Mind_Your_Tweets:_The_CIA_Social_Networking_Surveillance_System&lt;/ref&gt;

New media also serves as an important tool for both institutions and nations to promote their interest and values (The contents of such promotion may vary according to different  purposes). Some communities consider it an approach of "peaceful evolution" that may erode their own nation's system of values and eventually compromise national security.

==Interactivity==
[[Interactivity]] has become a term for a number of new media use options evolving from the rapid dissemination of [[Internet]] access points, the [[digitalization]] of media, and [[media convergence]]. In 1984, Rice defined new media as communication technologies that enable or facilitate user-to-user interactivity and interactivity between user and information.&lt;ref&gt;Schorr, A &amp; Schenk, M &amp; Campbell, W (2003),''Communication Research and Media Science in Europe'', Mouton de Gruyter, Berlin, pg. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Such a definition replaces the "[[Point-to-multipoint communication|one-to-many]]" model of traditional mass communication with the possibility of a "[[many-to-many]]" web of communication. Any individual with the appropriate technology can now produce his or her online media and include images, text, and sound about whatever he or she chooses.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau, David &amp; Hoynes, William (2003) Media Society: Industries, Images and Audiences (third edition), Pine Forge Press, Thousand Oaks, pg. 303&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the convergence of new methods of communication with new technologies shifts the model of mass communication, and radically reshapes the ways we interact and communicate with one another. In "What is new media?" Vin Crosbie&lt;ref name="Crosbie, 2002"&gt;[http://www.sociology.org.uk/as4mm3a.doc] Crosbie, V. (2002). What is New Media? Retrieved from http://www.sociology.org.uk/as4mm3a.doc&lt;/ref&gt; (2002) described three different kinds of communication media. He saw Interpersonal media as "one to one", Mass media as "one to many", and finally New Media as [[Individuation]] Media or "many to many".

When we think of interactivity and its meaning, we assume that it is only prominent in the conversational dynamics of individuals who are face-to-face. This restriction of opinion does not allow us to see its existence in mediated communication forums. Interactivity is present in some programming work, such as video games. It's also viable in the operation of traditional media. In the mid 1990s, filmmakers started using inexpensive digital cameras to create films. It was also the time when moving image technology had developed, which was able to be viewed on computer desktops in full motion. This development of new media technology was a new method for artists to share their work and interact with the big world. Other settings of interactivity include radio and television talk shows, letters to the editor, listener participation in such programs, and computer and technological programming.&lt;ref&gt;Rafaeli, Sheizaf (1988). "[https://www.academia.edu/533664/Interactivity_From_new_media_to_communication Interactivity: From new media to communication]". Beverly Hills, CA. Pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive new media has become a true benefit to every one because people can express their artwork in more than one way with the technology that we have today and there is no longer a limit to what we can do with our creativity.

Interactivity can be considered a central concept in understanding new media, but different media forms possess, or enable&lt;ref&gt;Rafaeli, Sheizaf &amp; Ariel, Yaron (2007), "Assessing Interactivity in Computer-Mediated Research". In: A.N Joinson, K.Y.A McKenna., T. Postmes &amp; U-D. Reips (Eds). The Oxford Handbook of Internet Psychology. Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; different degrees of interactivity,&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry (2002), ''New Media: An Introduction'', [[Oxford University Press]], UK, pg. 13&lt;/ref&gt; and some forms of digitized and converged media are not in fact interactive at all. Tony Feldman&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Tony (1997) ''An Introduction to Digital Media'', Routledege, London&lt;/ref&gt; considers digital [[satellite television]] as an example of a new media technology that uses digital compression to dramatically increase the number of television channels that can be delivered, and which changes the nature of what can be offered through the service, but does not transform the experience of television from the user's point of view, and thus lacks a more fully interactive dimension. It remains the case that interactivity is not an inherent characteristic of all new media technologies, unlike digitization and convergence.

[[Terry Flew]] (2005) argues that "the global interactive games industry is large and growing, and is at the forefront of many of the most significant innovations in new media" (Flew 2005: 101). Interactivity is prominent in these online video games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', ''[[The Sims Online]]'' and ''[[Second Life]]''. These games, which are developments of "new media," allow for users to establish relationships and experience a sense of belonging that transcends traditional temporal and spatial boundaries (such as when gamers logging in from different parts of the world interact). These games can be used as an escape or to act out a desired life. [[Will Wright (game designer)|Will Wright]], creator of ''The Sims'', "is fascinated by the way gamers have become so attached to his invention-with some even living their lives through it".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesun.co.uk/article The Sun Newspaper Online]&lt;/ref&gt; New media have created virtual realities that are becoming virtual extensions of the world we live in. With the creation of ''Second Life'' and [[Active Worlds]] before it, people have even more control over this virtual world, a world where anything that a participant can think of can become a reality.&lt;ref&gt;http://secondlife.com/whatis/#Be_Creative&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media changes continuously because it is constantly modified and redefined by the interaction between users, emerging technologies, cultural changes, etc.

New forms of New Media are emerging like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with video games and the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and that people want to watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because they are not only the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created that the majority of the gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.

==Industry==
The new media industry shares an open association with many market segments in areas such as [[software]]/[[video game design]], [[television]], [[radio]], [[mobile phone|mobile]] and particularly movies, [[advertising]] and [[marketing]], through which industry seeks to gain from the advantages of two-way dialogue with consumers primarily through the [[Internet]]. As a device to source the ideas, concepts, and intellectual properties of the general public, the [[television]] industry has used new media and the Internet to expand their resources for new programming and content. The advertising industry has also capitalized on the proliferation of new media with large agencies running multimillion-dollar [[interactive advertising]] subsidiaries. Interactive websites and kiosks have become popular. In a number of cases [[Advertising agency|advertising agencies]] have also set up new divisions to study new media. [[Public relations]] firms are also taking advantage of the opportunities in new media through [[interactive PR]] practices. Interactive PR practices include the use of social media&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2010/03/16/public-relations-social-media-results/&lt;/ref&gt; to reach a mass audience of online social network users.

With the rise of the Internet, many new career paths were created. Before the rise, many technical jobs were seen as nerdy. The Internet led to creative work that was seen as laid-back and diverse amongst sex, race, and sexual orientation. Web design, gaming design, webcasting, blogging, and animation are all creative career paths that came with this rise. At first glance, the field of new media may seem hip, cool, creative and relaxed.  What many don't realize is that working in this field is tiresome. Many of the people that work in this field don't have steady jobs. Work in this field has become project-based. Individuals work project to project for different companies. Most people are not working on one project or contract, but multiple ones at the same time. Despite working on numerous projects, people in this industry receive low payments, which is highly contrasted with the techy millionaire stereotype. It may seem as a carefree life from the outside, but it is not.  New media workers work long hours for little pay and spend up to 20 hours a week looking for new projects to work on.&lt;ref&gt;Rosalind Gill's Cool, Creative and Egalitarian?&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ideology of new media careers as an egalitarian and stress-free environment is a myth. It is a game of networking and thriving at what you are capable of. Many workers face job instability. Inequality within this field exists due to the informality and flexibility of this career path.

Within the Industry, many Companies have emerged or transformed to adapt to the fast moving exciting opportunities that new media offers. The following companies are great examples of the changing landscape of companies/agencies whom have redeveloped, added or changed services to offer new media services.&lt;ref name="Counting the change – The Economist"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.economist.com/news/business/21583687-media-companies-took-battering-internet-cash-digital-sources-lasty|title=Counting the change|accessdate=2015-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
Based on nationally representative data, a study conducted by [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] in five-year intervals in 1998–99, 2003–04, and 2008–09 found that with technology allowing nearly 24-hour media access, the amount of time young people spend with entertainment media has risen dramatically, especially among Black and Hispanic youth.&lt;ref&gt;Rideout V, Foehr U, Roberts D. Generation M2: Media in the lives o 8- to 18- year olds. January 2010, http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/8010.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, 8- to 18-year-olds devote an average of 7 hours and 38 minutes (7:38) to using entertainment media in a typical day (more than 53 hours a week) – about the same amount most adults spend at work per day.  Since much of that time is spent 'media multitasking' (using more than one medium at a time), they actually manage to spend a total of 10 hours and 45 minutes worth of media content in those 7½ hours per day. According to the [[Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project]], 96% of 18- to 29-year-olds and three-quarters (75%) of teens now own a cell phone, 88% of whom text, with 73% of wired American teens using social networking websites, a significant increase from previous years.&lt;ref name="pew"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/Reports/2010/Social-Media-and-Young-Adults.aspx|title=Social Media and Young Adults|last=Lenhart|first=Amanda|author2=Kristen Purcell |author3=Aaron Smith |author4=Kathryn Zickuhr |date=February 3, 2010|work=Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project|publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]|accessdate=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey of over 25000 9- to 16-year-olds from 25 European countries found that many underage children use social media sites despite the site's stated age requirements, and many youth lack the digital skills to use social networking sites safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Livingstone|first=Sonia|author2=Ólafsson, Kjartan |author3=Staksrud, Elisabeth |title=Risky Social Networking Practices Among "Underage" Users: Lessons for Evidence-Based Policy|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|year=2013|volume=18|issue=3|pages=303|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the new digital media demands a new educational model by parents and educators. The ''parental mediation'' become a way to manage the children’s experiences with Internet, chat, videogames and social network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyandmedia.eu/en/media-education/educating-in-the-knowledge-of-new-media/|title=Educating in the knowledge of New Media|date=2017-05-24|work=Family And Media|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent trend in internet is Youtubers Generation. Youtubers are young people who offer free video in their personal channel on YouTube. There are videos on games, fashion, food, cinema and music, where they offers tutorial or comments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.familyandmedia.eu/en/internet-and-social-network/who-are-they-and-why-do-kids-like-them-so-much/|title=YouTubers: Who are they, and why do kids like them so much?|date=2017-02-20|work=Family And Media|access-date=2017-10-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of cellular phones, such as the [[iPhone]], has created the inability to be in [[social isolation]], and the potential of ruining relationships. The iPhone activates the insular cortex of the brain, which is associated with feelings of love. People show similar feelings to their phones as they would to their friends, family and loved ones. Countless people spend more time on their phones, while in the presence of other people than spending time with the people in the same room or class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lindstrom|first=Martin|title=You Love Your iPhone.

==Political campaigns in the United States==
In trying to determine the impact of new media on [[political campaign]]ing and electioneering, the existing research has tried to examine whether new media supplants conventional media. [[Television]] is still the dominant news source, but new media's reach is growing. What is known is that new media has had a significant impact on elections and what began in the 2008 presidential campaign established new standards for how campaigns would be run. Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific audiences that can be reached via different [[social media]] platforms. Both parties have specific digital media strategies designed for voter outreach.

Additionally, their websites are socially connected, engaging voters before, during, and after elections. Email and [[text message]]s are also regularly sent to supporters encouraging them to donate and get involved.&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"&gt;Owen, D. (2011). New Media and Political Campaigns. In K. K. Jamieson (Ed.), The Oxford Handbook of Political Communication Theory and Research. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some existing research focuses on the ways that political campaigns, parties, and candidates have incorporated new media into their political strategizing. This is often a multi-faceted approach that combines new and old media forms to create highly specialized strategies. This allows them to reach wider audiences, but also to target very specific subsets of the electorate. They are able to tap into polling data and in some cases harness the [[web analytics|analytics]] of the traffic and profiles on various social media outlets to get real-time data about the kinds of engagement that is needed and the kinds of messages that are successful or unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"/&gt;
One body of existing research into the impact of new media on elections investigates the relationship between voters' use of new media and their level of political activity. They focus on areas such as "attentiveness, knowledge, attitudes, orientations, and engagement" (Owen, 2011). In references a vast body of research, Owen (2011) points out that older studies were mixed, while "newer research reveals more consistent evidence of information gain".&lt;ref name="Owen, D. 2011"/&gt;

Some of that research has shown that there is a connection between the amount and degree of voter engagement and turnout (Owen, 2011). However, new media may not have overwhelming effects on either of those. Other research is tending toward the idea that new media has reinforcing effect, that rather than completely altering, by increasing involvement, it "imitates the established pattern of [[political participation]]" (Nam, 2012). After analyzing the Citizenship Involvement Democracy survey, Nam (2012) found that "the internet plays a dual role in mobilizing political participation by people not normally politically involved, as well as reinforcing existing offline participation." These findings chart a middle ground between some research that optimistically holds new media up to be an extremely effective or extremely ineffective at fostering political participation.&lt;ref&gt;Nam, T. (2012). Dual effects on the internet on political activism: Reinforcing and mobilizing.Government Information Quarterly, S90–S97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Towner (2013) found, in his survey of college students, that attention to new media increases offline and online political participation particularly for young people. His research shows that the prevalence of online media boosts participation and engagement. His work suggests that "it seems that online sources that facilitate political involvement, communication, and mobilization, particularly campaign websites, social media, and blogs, are the most important for offline political participation among young people".&lt;ref&gt;Towner, T. L. (2013). All Political Participation is Socially Networked? New Media and the 2012 Election. Social Science Computer Review, 00(0), 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;
Deliberation When gauging effects and implications of new media on the political process, one means of doing so is to look at the deliberations that take place in these digital spaces (Halpern &amp; Gibbs, 2013). In citing the work of several researchers, Halpern and Gibbs (2003) define deliberation to be "the performance of a set of communicative behaviors that promote thorough discussion. and the notion that in this process of communication the individuals involved weigh carefully the reasons for and against some of the propositions presented by others".&lt;ref name="Halpern, D. 2013"&gt;Halpern, D., &amp; Gibbs, J. (2013). Social media as a catalyst for online deliberation? Exploring the affordances of Facebook and YouTube for political expression. Computers in Human Behavior, 1159-1168.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Halpern and Gibbs (2013) "suggest that although social media may not provide a forum for intensive or in-depth policy debate, it nevertheless provides a deliberative space to discuss and encourage political participation, both directly and indirectly". Their work goes a step beyond that as well though because it shows that some social media sites foster a more robust [[political debate]] than do others such as Facebook which includes highly personal and identifiable access to information about users alongside any comments they may post on political topics. This is in contrast to sites like YouTube whose comments are often posted anonymously.&lt;ref name="Halpern, D. 2013"/&gt;

== Ethical Issues in New Media Research ==
Due to the popularity of new media, social media websites (SMWs) like Facebook and Twitter are becoming increasingly popular among researchers (Moreno, Goniu, Moreno, Diekema, 2013).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=M.A.|last2=Goniu|first2=N.|last3=Moreno|first3=P.S|last4=Diekema|first4=D.|date=2013|title=Ethics of Social Media Research: Common Concerns and Practical Considerations|url=|journal=Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking|volume=16|pages=708–713|doi=10.1089/cyber.2012.0334|via=|pmc=3942703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although SMWs present new opportunities, they also represent challenges for researchers interested in studying social phenomena online, since it can be difficult to determine what are acceptable risks to privacy unique to social media. Some scholars (e.g. Moreno, Frost &amp; Christakis, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moreno|first=M.A.|last2=Frost|first2=N.C.|last3=Christakis|first3=D.A|date=2008|title=Research ethics in the MySpace era|url=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=121|pages=157–161|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that standard Institutional Review Board (IRB) procedures provide little guidance on research protocols relating to social media in particular.

As a consequence, Moreno et al. (2013) identified three major approaches to research on social media and relevant concerns scholars should consider before engaging in social media research.

=== Observational Research ===
One of the major issues for observational research is whether a particular project is considered to involve human subjects. A human subject is one that “is defined by federal regulations as a living individual about whom an investigator obtains data through interaction with the individual or identifiable private information”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Moreno et al. (2013) note that if access to a social media site is public, information is considered identifiable but not private, and information gathering procedures do not require researchers to interact with the original poster of the information, then this does not meet the requirements for human subjects research. Research may also be exempt if the disclosure of participant responses outside the realm of the published research does not subject the participant to civic or criminal liability, damage the participant’s reputation, employability or financial standing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given these criteria, however, researchers still have considerable leeway when conducting observational research on social media. Many profiles on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Twitter are public and researchers are free to use that data for observational research.

It should be noted, however, that users have the ability to change their privacy settings on most social media websites. Facebook, for example, provides users with the ability to restrict who sees their posts through specific privacy settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boyd|first=M.A|date=2011|title=Social privacy in networked publics: teens' attitudes, practices and strategies. A decade in internet time.|url=|journal=Symposium on the Dynamics of the Internet and Society|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also debate about whether requiring users to create a username and password is sufficient to establish whether the data is considered public or private. Historically, Institutional Review Boards considered such websites to be private,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; although newer websites like YouTube call this practice into question. For example, YouTube only requires the creation of a username and password to post videos and/or view adult content, but anyone is free to view general YouTube videos and these general videos would not be subject to consent requirements for researchers looking to conduct observational studies.

=== Interactive Research ===
According to Romano et al. (2013), interactive research occurs when "a researcher wishes to access the [social media website] content that is not publicly available" (pg. 710). Because researchers have limited ways of accessing this data, this could mean that a researcher sends a Facebook user a friend request, or follows a user on Twitter in order to gain access to potentially protected tweets (pg.711). While it could be argued that such actions would violate a social media user's expectation of privacy, Ellison, Steinfield and Lampe (2007) argued that actions like "friending" or "following" an individual on social media constitutes a "loose tie" relationship and therefore not sufficient to establish a reasonable expectation of privacy since individuals often have friends or followers they have never even met.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellison|first=Nicole B.|last2=Steinfield|first2=Charles|last3=Lampe|first3=Cliff|date=July 2007|title=The Benefits of Facebook "Friends:" Social Capital and College Students’ Use of Online Social Network Sites|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|volume=12|issue=4|pages=1143–1168|doi=10.1111/j.1083-6101.2007.00367.x|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Survey/Interview Research ===
Because research on social media occurs online, it is difficult for researchers to observe participant reactions to the informed consent process. For example, when collecting information about activities that are potentially illegal, or recruiting participants from stigmatized populations, this lack of physical proximity could potentially negatively impact the informed consent process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another important consideration regards the confidentiality of information provided by participants. While information provided over the internet might be perceived as lower risk, studies that publish direct quotes from study participants might expose them to the risk of being identified via a Google search&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''''{{lang|la|XII Panegyrici Latini}}''''' or '''''Twelve Latin Panegyrics''''' is the conventional title of a  collection of twelve [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]]  and [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] prose [[panegyric]] orations written in Latin.
The authors of most of the speeches in the collection are anonymous, but appear to have been Gallic in origin. Aside from the first panegyric, composed by [[Pliny the Younger]] in {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;100, the other speeches in the collection date to between {{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;289 and 389 and were probably composed in [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]].&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 4"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 4.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The original manuscript, discovered in 1433, has perished; only copies remain.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 3–4"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Gaul had a long history as a center of rhetoric. It maintained its dominance of the field well into the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;T.J. Haarhoff, ''Schools of Gaul'' (London, 1920; rept. Johannesburg, 1958), ''passim'', cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; An early lead in the field was taken by the [[Aedui]], early allies of Rome and eager to assimilate to the ways of their new rulers: Maenian schools were celebrated as early as the reign of [[Tiberius]] ({{abbr|r.|Ruled}}&amp;nbsp;{{sc|ad}}&amp;nbsp;14–37).&lt;ref&gt;Tacitus, ''Annals'' 3.43, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; They continued to flourish into the days of Eumenius' grandfather, but were closed by the mid-3rd century.&lt;ref&gt;''Pan''. 9.17.2–3, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There was some revival in the city in the late 3rd century, but after the establishment of Trier as an imperial capital in the 280s, the orators began feeling jealousy for the imperial patronage enjoyed by the citizens of Trier.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 8"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the political and economic hegemony of the city, however, Trier failed to make any significant mark on the rhetoric of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Haarhoff, ''Schools of Gaul'', 48, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Nixon and Rodgers suggest that it was simply too close to the imperial court.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 8"/&gt; 
The surviving evidence (which might be prejudiced by [[Ausonius]]' ''Professors of Bordeaux'') points to a shift from Autun and Trier as centers of the art in the Tetrarchic and Constantinian period, moving to Bordeaux later in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Haarhoff, ''Schools of Gaul'', 46–48, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 8; Nixon and Rodgers, 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The panegyrics evince a familiarity with prior handbooks of rhetoric. Some have argued that [[Menander of Laodicea]]'s treatises were particularly influential on the collection, and believed his precepts were used in the tenth panegyric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. |last=Mesk |title=Zur Technik der lateinischen Panegyriker |journal=[[Rheinisches Museum für Philologie]] |volume=67 |issue= |year=1912 |pages=569–590 [p. 573] |url=http://www.rhm.uni-koeln.de/067/Mesk.pdf }} Cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, because so much of Menander's advice consisted of standard rhetorical procedure, the parallels adduced in favor of Menander as a model are insufficient to prove his direct use by the panegyrists. Other handbooks of rhetoric might also have had influence on the collection. [[Quintilian]]'s ''Institutio Oratoria'', for example, treats the subject of an oration's ancestry, parentage, and country in a manner similar to the panegyrics of 289, 291, 297, 310, 311, 321, and 389.&lt;ref&gt;Quintilian, ''Institutio Oratoria'' 3.7.10ff; Galletier I: xxxi, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In any case, the other panegyrics in the collection vary widely from Menander's schema.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Parallels with other Latin orators, like [[Cicero]] and [[Pliny the Younger]], are less frequent than they would have been if those authors had served as stylistic models.&lt;ref&gt;E. Vereecke, "Le Corpus des Panégyriques latins de l'époque tardive," ''Antiquité classique'' 44 (1975): 151–53, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language and style ==
The Latin of the panegyrics is that of a [[Classical Latin#Authors of the Golden Age|Golden Age]] Latin base, derived from an education heavy on Cicero, mixed with a large number of [[Classical Latin#Silver Age Latin|Silver Age]] usages and a small number of Late and [[Vulgar Latin|Vulgar]] terms.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; To students of Latin in Late Antiquity, Cicero and [[Virgil]] represented the paragons of the language; as such, the panegyrists made frequent use of them. Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]'' is the favorite source, the ''[[Georgics]]'' the second favorite, and the ''[[Eclogues]]'' a distant third.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 16. See also: Rees, "Praising in Prose: Vergil and the Panegyric," in ''Romane Memento: Vergil in the Fourth Century'' (London: Duckworth, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt; (Other poets are much less popular: there are infrequent allusions to [[Horace]],&lt;ref&gt;As at 9.2.4, referencing ''Carmina'' 2.1.22, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and one complete borrowing from [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;12.25.2–3, modeled on Ovid, ''Metamorphoses'' 15.746–61, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;) When drawing from Cicero's body of work, the panegyrists looked first to those works where he expressed admiration and contempt. As a source of praise, Cicero's panegyric of [[Pompey]] in support of the Manilian law (''[[De Imperio Cn. Pompei]]'') was quite popular. It is echoed thirty-six times in the collection, across nine or ten of the eleven late panegyrics. Cicero's three orations in honor of [[Julius Caesar]] were also useful. Of these, the panegyrists were especially fond of the ''[[Pro Marcello]]''; across eight panegyrics there are more than twelve allusions to the work. For vilification, the [[Catiline Orations|Catiline]] and [[In Verrem|Verine]] orations were the prominent sources (there are eleven citations to the former and eight to the latter work).&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other classic prose models had less influence on the panegyrics. Pliny's ''Panegyricus'' model is familiar to the authors of panegyrics 5, 6, 7,&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 18 n.68.&lt;/ref&gt; 11, and especially 10, in which there are several verbal likenesses. [[Sallust]]'s ''Bellum Catilinae'' is echoed in the panegyrics 10 and 12, and his ''Jugurthine War'' in 6, 5, and 12.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Livy seems to have been of some use in panegyric 12&lt;ref&gt;At 12.15.6, borrows its sentiments and phrasing to Livy 28.44.8, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and 8.&lt;ref&gt;At 8.16.4, which echoes Livy 38.17.3, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The panegyrist of 8 must have been familiar with [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto|Fronto]], whose praise of [[Marcus Aurelius]] he mentions,&lt;ref&gt;At 8.14.2, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and the panegyrist of 6 seems to have known [[Tacitus]]' ''[[Agricola (book)|Agricola]]''.&lt;ref&gt;At 6.9.3, which echoes Tacitus ''Agricola'' 12; B. Baldwin, "Tacitus, the ''Panegyrici Latini'', and the ''Historia Augusta''," ''Eranos'' 78 (1980): 175–78, and N. Baglivi, "Osservazioni su Paneg. VII(6),9," ''Orpheus'' 7 (1986): 329–37, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Aeduan orators, who refer to Julius Caesar in the context of Gaul and Britain, are either directly familiar with his prose or know of his figure through intermediaries like [[Florus]], the historian.&lt;ref&gt;Klotz, "Studen zu den Panegyrici Latini," 546, 554, (cited at Nixon and Rodgers, 18 n.72) argues for the latter case; Nixon and Rodgers (at Nixon and Rodgers, 18) argue for the former.&lt;/ref&gt; Panegyric 12, meanwhile, contains a direct allusion to Caesar's ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili|Bellum civile]]''.&lt;ref&gt;At 12.6.1–2, alluding to ''Bellum civile'' 3.80.1–81.2, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

Accentual and metrical clausulae were used by all the Gallic panegyrists. All of the panegyrists, save Eumenius, used both forms at a rate of about 75 percent or better (Eumenius used the former 67.8 percent of the time, and the latter 72.4 percent).&lt;ref&gt;Steven M. Oberhelman and Ralph G. Hall, "Meter in Accentual Clausulae," ''Classical Philology'' 80:3 (1985): 222–23, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a common metrical rhythm at the time, but had gone out of style by the 5th century, when metrical considerations no longer mattered.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

|colspan = "4" align="center"  | After Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 20.
|}

The collection comprises the following speeches:
# by [[Pliny the Younger]]. It was originally a speech of thanks (''gratiarum actio'') for the [[consul]]ship, which he held in 100, and was delivered in the [[Roman Senate|Senate]] in honour of Emperor [[Trajan]]. This work, which is much earlier than the rest of the collection and geographically anomalous, probably served as a model for the other speeches.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 4; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny was a popular author in the late 4th  century—[[Quintus Aurelius Symmachus]] modeled his letters on Pliny's, for example&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 7 n.22; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 22 n.84.&lt;/ref&gt;—and the whole collection might have been designed as an ''[[exemplum]]'' in his honor.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 7"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; He later revised and considerably expanded the work, which for this reason is by far the longest of the whole collection. Pliny presents Trajan as the ideal ruler, or ''optimus princeps'', to the reader, and contrasts him with his predecessor [[Domitian]].
# by [[Pacatus Drepanius|Pacatus]] in honour of Emperor [[Theodosius I]], delivered in [[Rome]] in 389.
# by [[Claudius Mamertinus]] in honour of Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]], delivered in [[Constantinople]] in 362, also as a speech of thanks at his assumption of the office of consul of that year.
# by [[Nazarius (rhetorician)|Nazarius]]. It was delivered in [[Rome]] before the Senate in 321 at the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the accession of [[Constantine I]] and the fifth anniversary of his sons [[Crispus]] and [[Constantine II (emperor)]] becoming [[Caesar (title)|''caesares'']]. The speech is peculiar because none of the honoured emperors was present at its delivery, and because it celebrates Constantine's victory over [[Maxentius]] (at the [[Battle of Milvian Bridge]]) in 312, avoiding almost any reference to contemporaneous events.
# from the year 311, delivered in [[Trier]] by an anonymous orator, who gives thanks to Constantine I for a tax relief for his home town [[Autun]].
# by an anonymous (yet different) author, also delivered at the court in Trier in 310, at the occasion of Constantine's ''quinquennalia'' (fifth anniversary of accession) and the founding day of the city of Trier. It contains the description of an appearance of the sun god [[Apollo]] to Constantine, which has often been regarded as a model of Constantine's later [[Battle of Milvian Bridge|Christian vision]]. Also, the speech promulgates the legend that the emperor [[Claudius II]] was Constantine's ancestor.
# by an anonymous author delivered at the wedding of Constantine to [[Maximian]]'s daughter [[Fausta]] in 307, probably also at Trier, and it therefore contains the praise of both emperors and their achievements. The bride and the wedding feature only to a very limited degree in the oration.
# celebrates the reconquest of [[Roman Britain|Britain]] by [[Constantius Chlorus]], ''caesar'' of the [[tetrarchy]], from [[Allectus]] in 296. The speech was probably delivered in 297 in Trier, then the residence of Constantius.
# is the second speech in the collection where the emperor was not present. It is by [[Eumenius]], teacher of [[rhetoric]] at Autun, and is directed at the governor of the province of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]]. It was most probably delivered in 297/298, either in Autun or [[Lyon]]. Apart from its main subject, the restoration of the school of rhetoric at Autun, it praises the achievements of the emperors of the tetrarchy, especially those of Constantius.
# from the year 289 (and therefore the earliest of the [[Late Antiquity|late antique]] speeches of the collection), at Trier in honour of Maximian at the occasion of the founding day of the city of Rome. According to a disputed manuscript tradition, the author was a certain [[Claudius Mamertinus|Mamertinus]], who is identified with the author of the next speech.
# from 291, also at Trier to Maximian, at the emperor's birthday. It is often attributed to Mamertinus, probably ''magister memoriae'' (private secretary) of Maximian, though the text is corrupt and the authorship not entirely certain.
# by an anonymous orator, delivered in Trier in 313, celebrating (and describing extensively) Constantine's victory over Maxentius in 312. The author of this panegyric makes heavy use of Virgil.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==
The panegyrics exemplify the culture of imperial ''praesentia'', or "presence", also encapsulated in the imperial ceremony of ''[[Adventus (ceremony)|adventus]]'', or "arrival".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 6–7. See also: S. MacCormack, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435301 Change and Continuity in Late Antiquity: The Ceremony of "Adventus"]," ''Historia'' 21:4 (1972): 721–52; B.S. Rodgers, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4435950 Divine Insinuation in the "Panegyrici Latini"]," ''Historia'' 35:1 (1986): 69–104.&lt;/ref&gt; The panegyrics held it as a matter of fact that the appearance of an emperor was directly responsible for bringing security and beneficence.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; The orators held this visible presence in tension with another, more abstract notion of the timeless, omnipresent, ideal emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; The panegyrist of 291 remarked that the meeting between Diocletian and Maximian over the winter of 290/91 was like the meeting of two deities; had the emperors ascended the Alps together, their bright glow would have illuminated all of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''Pan''. 11.10.4–5, 11.4, cited in Van Dam, 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Panegyrics came to form part of the vocabulary through which citizens could discuss notions of "authority". Indeed, because panegyrics and public ceremony were such a prominent part of imperial display, they, and not the emperor's more substantiative legislative or military achievements, became the emperor's "vital essence" in the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;Van Dam, 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and tradition of the collection ==
=== Compilation and purpose ===
The formation of the ''Panegyrici Latini'' is usually divided into two or three phases. At first, there was a collection of five speeches by various anonymous authors from Autun, containing numbers 5 through 9 above.&lt;ref&gt;W. Baehrens, "Zur quaestio Eumeniana," ''Rheinisches museum fur philologie'' 67 (1912): 313; and Galletier, 1: xiii and xix, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the speeches 10 and 11, which are connected to Trier, were appended; when 12 joined the collection, is uncertain. At some later date, the speeches 2, 3 and 4 were added.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; They differ from the earlier orations because they were delivered outside of Gaul (in Rome and Constantinople), and because the names of their authors are preserved. Pliny's panegyric was set at the beginning of the collection as classical model of the genre.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 4"/&gt; Sometimes the author of the last speech, Pacatus, is credited as the editor of the final ''corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;As in R. Pichon, ''Les derniers écrivains profanes'' (Paris, 1906), 285–91, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 6 n. 18; Roger Rees, "The Private Lives of Public Figures in Latin Prose Panegyric," in ''The Propaganda of Power: The Role of Panegyric in Late Antiquity'', ed. Mary Whitby  (Boston: Brill, 1998), 99.&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is founded on the position of Pacatus' speech in the ''corpus''—second after Pliny's—and because of the heavy debt Pacatus owes to the earlier speeches in the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, "Private Lives", 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of the speeches in the borrow from their predecessors in the collection, Pacatus borrows the most, taking ideas and phraseology from almost all the other speeches. He is especially indebted to the panegyric of 313.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the collection is thematically unconnected and chronologically disordered, Nixon and Rodgers conclude that "it served no political or historical purpose", and was simply a tool for students and practitioners of panegyrical rhetoric.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 7"/&gt; Roger Rees, however, argues that the circumstances of its composition (if Pacatus is taken as its compiler) suggest that it was intended to illustrate Gaul's continuing loyalty to Rome. Along the same line, Pacatus' speech of 389 might have been meant to reassure Theodosius (who had defeated the usurper [[Magnus Maximus]] in Gaul the previous year) that Gaul was completely loyal to him.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Manuscript tradition ===
The ''Panegyrici Latini'' make up most of the sixteen pre-400 Latin prose speeches in praise of Roman emperors that survive today. (The remaining four consist of three fragmentary speeches from Symmachus and one speech by Ausonius.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;) Only one manuscript of the ''Panegyrici Latini'' has survived into the 15th century, when it was discovered in 1433 in a monastery in [[Mainz]], Germany by [[Giovanni Aurispa|Johannes Aurispa]].&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 3–4"/&gt; That manuscript, known as M (Moguntinus), was copied several times before it was lost. Two branches of Italian manuscripts derive from a copy Aurispa made of M, X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 35–36; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; These are also lost,&lt;ref&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; but twenty-seven manuscripts descend from the pair. The evidence of the surviving manuscripts suggests that Aurispa's copy of M was made in haste, and that the Italian manuscripts are generally inferior to the other tradition, H.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another independent tradition branches off of M: H (at the [[British Library]]: Harleianus 2480), N (at [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], Romania: Napocensis), and A (at the [[Uppsala University Library]]).&lt;ref name="NR36R19"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 36; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; H and N are both 15th-century manuscripts, transcribed in a German hand. H shows corrections from a near-contemporary, ''h''. N was copied at some time between 1455 and 1460 by the German theologian Johannes Hergot.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 36"&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Detailed investigation of the manuscripts by D. Lassandro has revealed that A derives from N and N derives from H.&lt;ref&gt;D. Lassandro, "I manoscritti HNA nella tradizione dei ''Panegyrici Latini''," ''Bolletino del Comitato per la preparazione della Edizione Nazionale dei classici Greci e Latini'' 15 (1967): 55–97, cited in Nixon and Rodgers, 36, and Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19.&lt;/ref&gt; H is usually considered the best surviving manuscript.&lt;ref name="NR36R19"/&gt;

Modern editions of the ''Panegyrici'' incorporate variant readings from outside H.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when X&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and X&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are in agreement, they sometimes preserve the true reading of M against H. They also contain useful emendations from the intelligent humanist corrector of Vaticanus 1775.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 36"/&gt; Early print editions also prove helpful, as Livineius' 1599 Antwerp edition contains variant readings from the work of scholar Franciscus Modius, who made use of another manuscript at the [[abbey of Saint Bertin]] at [[Saint-Omer]] (Bertinensis).&lt;ref&gt;Nixon and Rodgers, 36; Rees, ''Layers of Loyalty'', 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Bertinensis is now generally believed to be cognate with, rather than derived from, M. [[Johannes Cuspinian|Cuspinianus]]' 1513 Vienna edition has proved more problematic. The relationship of M to the manuscripts Cuspinianus used is a mystery, and additional material, varying in length from single words to whole clauses, is found in Cuspinianus' text and nowhere else. Some scholars, like Galletier, reject Cuspinianus' additions in their entirety; Nixon and Rodgers chose to judge each addition separately.&lt;ref name="Nixon and Rodgers, 36"/&gt; Puteolanus' 1476 Milan edition and ''h''{{'}}s corrections have also proved valuable.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''''Quercus suber''''', commonly called the '''cork oak''',  is a medium-sized, [[evergreen]] [[oak]] tree in the section [[Quercus section Cerris|''Quercus'' sect. ''Cerris'']]. It is the primary source of [[cork (material)|cork]] for wine bottle stoppers and other uses, such as cork flooring and as the cores of [[cricket ball]]s.  It is native to southwest Europe and northwest [[Africa]]. In the [[Mediterranean basin]] the tree is an ancient species with [[fossil]] remnants dating back to the [[Tertiary period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Eriksson, E.|author2=Varela, M.C.|author3=Lumaret, R.|author4=Gil, L.|last-author-amp=yes|title=Genetic conservation of Quercus suber|publisher=European Forest Genetic Resources Programme ([[EUFORGEN]]), [[Bioversity International]]|date=2017|url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin/templates/euforgen.org/upload/Publications/Thematic_publications/Quercus_TB_OpenSourceCR_web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It grows to up to {{cvt|20|m}}, although it is typically more stunted in its native environment. The leaves are {{cvt|4|to|7|cm}} long, weakly lobed or coarsely toothed, dark green above, paler beneath, with the leaf margins often downcurved. The [[acorn]]s are {{cvt|2|to|3|cm}} long, in a deep cup fringed with elongated scales.

In the Portuguese town of [[Águas de Moura]] is located the Sobreiro Monumental (Monumental Cork Oak), a tree 234 years old, {{convert|16|m}} tall and with a trunk that requires at least five people to embrace it. It has been considered a National Monument since 1988, and the Guinness Book of Records states it as the largest and oldest in the world.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Ecology==
The cork oak forest is one of the major plant communities of the [[Mediterranean woodlands and forests]] [[ecoregion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/pa1214 Mediterranean Woodland and Forest Ecoregion: Northern Africa: Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia.] World Wildlife Fund. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Natural stands of cork oak can support [[biodiversity|diverse]] [[ecosystems]]. For example, in parts of northwestern [[North Africa]], some cork oak forests are [[habitat]] to the [[endangered]] [[Barbary macaque]], ''Macaca sylvanus'', a species whose habitat is fragmented and whose range was prehistorically much wider.&lt;ref name=hogan&gt;Hogan, C.M.
 [https://web.archive.org/web/20090831095518/http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=31757 Barbary Macaque, ''Macaca sylvanus''.] GlobalTwitcher.com, Ed. N. Stromberg.&lt;/ref&gt; In Western Europe, particularly in [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]], the cork oak forests are home to endangered species such as the [[Iberian lynx]], the most critically threatened feline in the world.&lt;ref name=santos&gt;Santos Pereira, J., Bugalho, M.N., and Caldeira, M.D. (2008). [http://www.apcor.pt/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/From-the-Cork-Oak-to-Cork-a-sustainable-system.pdf ''From the Cork Oak to Cork: A Sustainable Ecosystem''.] APCOR: Portuguese Cork Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[pyrophyte]], this tree has a thick, insulating bark that makes it well adapted to [[forest fire]]s. After a fire, many tree species regenerate from seeds (as, for example, the [[maritime pine]]) or resprout from the base of the tree (as, for example, the [[holm oak]]). The bark of the cork oak allows it to survive fires and then simply regrow branches to fill out the canopy. The quick regeneration of this oak makes it successful in the fire-adapted ecosystems of the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean biome]].&lt;ref name=santos/&gt;

==Cultivation and use==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2011}}
[[File:Cork oak trunk section.jpg|thumb|A cross section of the trunk of a cork oak]]
The tree forms a thick, rugged [[Bark (botany)|bark]] containing high levels of [[suberin]]. Over time the [[cork cambium]] layer of bark can develop considerable thickness and can be harvested every 7 to 10 years to produce [[Cork (material)|cork]]. The harvesting of cork does not harm the tree, in fact, no trees are cut down during the harvesting process. Only the bark is extracted, and a new layer of cork regrows, making it a [[renewable resource]]. The tree is cultivated in [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], [[France]], [[Italy]] and [[Tunisia]]. Cork oaks are considered to be soil builders and their fruits have been shown to have useful insecticidal properties. Cork oak forests cover approximately 25,000 square kilometres in those countries (equivalent to {{convert|2,500,000|ha}}). Portugal accounts for around 50% of the world cork harvest. Cork oaks cannot legally be cut down in Portugal, except for [[forestry|forest management]] felling of old, unproductive trees, and, even in those cases, farmers need special permission from the Ministry of Agriculture.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

''Q. suber'' is commonly grown in [[agroforestry]] systems, known as ''montado'' in [[Portugal]] and ''dehesa'' in Spain. These are open woods with low tree density (50–300 trees/ha). In these systems, [[forage]] species are commonly grown under the trees and grazed by [[cattle]] during the summer.&lt;ref name='gil08'&gt;{{citation |author=Gil, L. |author2=Varela, M. |last-author-amp=yes|title=Cork oak - ''Quercus suber'': Technical guidelines for genetic conservation and use|date=2008 |pages=6 |url=http://www.euforgen.org/fileadmin//bioversity/publications/pdfs/1323_Cork_oak__Quercus_suber_.pdf |publisher=[[European Forest Genetic Resources Programme]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cork oaks commonly live more than 200 years.&lt;ref name=santos/&gt; Virgin cork (or 'male' cork) is the first cork cut from generally 25-year-old trees. Another 9 to 12 years is required for the second harvest, and a tree can be harvested about twelve times in its lifetime. Cork harvesting is done entirely without machinery, being dependent solely on human labor. Usually five people are required to harvest the tree's bark, using a small axe. The process requires training due to the skill required to harvest bark without harming the tree. The European cork industry produces 300,000 [[tonne]]s of cork a year, with a value of [[Euro|€]]1.5 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] and employing 30,000 people. [[Wine]] corks represent 15% of cork usage by weight but 66% of revenues.

The cork left after stoppers have been made is used to make a wide range of products, including insulation panels, floor and wall tiles and [[sound-proofing]] in the car industry, as well as for [[handicrafts]] and artistic uses. This include ''cork paper'', used in printing, book covering, clothing manufacture, cork ''maroquinerie'' and other products. Cork is also used in making [[cricket ball]]s, Hurling Ball (Sliothars), badminton shuttlecocks, handles of fishing rods and special devices for the [[space industry]].&lt;ref name='gil08'/&gt;

Cork oaks are sometimes planted as individual trees, providing a minor income to their owners. The tree is also sometimes cultivated for ornament. [[Hybrid (biology)|Hybrids]] with turkey oak (''[[Quercus cerris]]'') are regular, both in the wild in southwest Europe and in cultivation; the hybrid is known as Lucombe oak ''Quercus'' × ''hispanica''. Some cork is also produced in eastern [[Asia]] from the related Chinese cork oak (''[[Quercus variabilis]]'')

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Pathogens==
Cork oak is relatively resistant to pathogens, but some diseases occur in the species. [[Leaf spot]] can be caused by the fungus ''[[Apiognomonia errabunda]]''. Other fungi can cause leaf scorching, [[powdery mildew]], [[Rust (fungus)|rust]], and [[canker]]s.&lt;ref name=mor&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moricca |first1=Salvatore |last2=Linaldeddu |first2=Benedetto T. |last3=Ginetti |first3=Beatrice |last4=Scanu |first4=Bruno |last5=Franceschini |first5=Antonio |last6=Ragazzi |first6=Alessandro |title=Endemic and Emerging Pathogens Threatening Cork Oak Trees: Management Options for Conserving a Unique Forest Ecosystem |journal=Plant Disease |date=2016 |volume=100 |issue=11 |pages=2184–2193 |doi=10.1094/PDIS-03-16-0408-FE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most virulent cork oak pathogen may be ''[[Diplodia corticola]]'', a [[Ascomycota|sac fungus]] which causes sap-bleeding sunken canker wounds in the wood, withering of the leaves, and lesions on the acorns. The fungus ''[[Biscogniauxia mediterranea]]'' is becoming more common in cork oak forests. Its fruiting bodies appear as charcoal-black cankers. Both of these fungi are transmitted by the [[Platypus cylindrus|oak pinhole borer]] (''Platypus cylindrus''), a species of weevil.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt;

The common water mould ''[[Phytophthora cinnamomi]]'' grows in the roots of the tree and has been known to devastate cork oak woodlands.&lt;ref name=mor/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5016">'''SQRRR''' or '''SQ3R''' is a [[reading comprehension]] method named for its five steps: '''survey, question, read, recite, and review'''. The method was introduced by [[Francis P. Robinson]], an American education philosopher in his 1946 book ''Effective Study''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn = 978-0-06-045521-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The method offers a more efficient and active approach to reading textbook material.{{cn|date=February 2018}} It was created for college students, but is extremely useful for young students as well. Classrooms all over the world have begun using this method to better understand what they are reading.&lt;ref name="gunning"&gt;{{cite book

Similar methods developed subsequently include [[PQRST (study skill)|PQRST]] and [[KWL table]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.einstein.yu.edu/education/student-affairs/academic-support-counseling/study-methods/reading-course-textbooks.aspx|title=Reading Course Textbooks|publisher=Office of Academic Support &amp; Counseling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Process ==
#Survey
#:The first step, survey or [[Speed_reading#Skimming_and_scanning|skim]], advises that one should resist the temptation to read the book and instead first go through a chapter and note headings, sub-headings and other outstanding features, such as figures, tables, and summary paragraphs. This survey step only takes 3–5 minutes, but it provides an outline or framework for what will be presented. The reader should identify ideas and formulate questions about the content of the chapter.
#Question
#:[[Inquiry-based learning|Generate questions]] about the content of the reading. For example, convert headings and sub-headings into questions, and then look for answers in the content of the text. Other more general questions may also be formulated:
#:* ''What is this chapter about?
#:* ''What question is this chapter trying to answer?''
#:* ''How does this information help me?''
#:* The Question step again only takes 3–5 minutes to complete, but it will motivate the reader to seek answers to the questions.
#Read (R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)
#:Use the background work done with "S" and "Q" in order to begin reading actively. This means reading in order to answer the questions raised under "Q". Passive reading, in contrast, results in merely reading without engaging with the study material.
#Recite (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)
#:The second "R" refers to the part known as "Recite." The reader should try to retrieve from memory what was learned in the same manner as telling someone else about the information. It is important that the reader use his/her own words in order to formulate and conceptualize the material. Try recalling and identifying major points (heading/subheadings) and answers to questions from the "Q" step. This recital step may be done either in an oral or written format and is related to the benefits of retrieval ([[testing effect]]) in boosting long-term memory for the material.
#Review (R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)
#:The final "R" is "Review." Once you reach the end of the passage, say back to yourself what the point of the whole passage is – again, using your own words. You may then repeat the process on the second set of questions. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat/new-sat-tips-planning/sat-reading-test-strategies/a/sat-active-reading-strategies-part-1-sq3r&lt;/ref&gt;

== Six stages of effective comprehension ==
Best's process of effective comprehension suggests six stages for better understanding a topic while in a learning process.

*Knowing vs Understanding what the passage says (Fact finding vs Making meaning with [[time management]]).
*Reflecting (Bringing the information to life in your own words to personalize and consolidate).
*Interpersonal understanding (Checking whether the reader understood the topic e.g. Explaining the idea to someone, doing seminars...etc.)
*Intrapersonal understanding (Finding personal significance (interpret, compare &amp; conclude tentatively) of the topic in real world aspects)
*Visualisation (Tony Buzan's [[Mind Map]]ping)
*[[Mindfulness]] and [[Acceptance]]

A '''sagittal plane''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|æ|dʒ|ɪ|t|əl}}), or '''longitudinal plane''', is an anatomical plane which divides the body into right and left parts.&lt;ref name="Vella2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark Vella|title=Anatomy for Strength and Fitness Training|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Beed0ml1t6IC&amp;pg=PA16|accessdate=4 January 2013|date=May 2008|publisher=New Holland Publishers|isbn=978-1-84773-153-1|pages=16–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plane may be in the center of the body and split it into two halves ([[mid-sagittal plane|mid-sagittal]]) or away from the midline and split it into unequal parts (para-sagittal).

Most elements of [[Irish dancing]] occur in the sagittal plane.&lt;ref&gt;Madden, Christopher; Putukian, Margot; McCarty, Eric; and Young, Craig (2017). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=hWclDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1822&amp;dq=%22dance+moves+are%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiBm-SC1LbSAhVpxlQKHTHJB7MQ6AEIQDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dance%20moves%20are%22&amp;f=false Netter's Sports Medicine]'', {{unpaginated}}. Elsevier Health Sciences. {{ISBN|9780323442572}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations in terminology==
Examples include:

* The terms ''[[median plane]]'' or ''mid-sagittal plane'' are sometimes used to describe the [[wikt:sagittal plane|sagittal plane]] running through the midline. This plane cuts the body into halves (assuming [[bilateral symmetry]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|six/000083004|Median plane}}&lt;/ref&gt; passing through midline structures such as the [[navel]] and [[Vertebral column|spine]]. It is one of the planes which, combined with the [[Umbilical plane]], defines the [[Quadrant (abdomen)|four quadrants]] of the [[human abdomen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kapit | first = Wynn | title = The anatomy coloring book | publisher = Pearson | location = San Francisco | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780321832016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The term ''parasagittal'' is used to describe any plane parallel to the sagittal plane. In practice, such a section is often referred to simply as a "sagittal" view because viewing is achieved along the sagittal axis (see below). Owing to the specific nature of its definition, only one true sagittal plane exists, and it corresponds to the "mid-sagittal" view. Be aware that the term "sagittal view" may be applied to any parasagittal section as well as the sagittal plane, as the parasagittal and sagittal axes are identical (parallel to the sagittal plane). &lt;br&gt; Specific named parasagittal planes include:
** The [[midclavicular line]] crosses through the [[clavicle]].
** Other sagittal lines/planes include the ''lateral sternal'' and ''parasternal''.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7817-9013-1"&gt;{{cite book |author=Yokochi, Chihiro; [[Rohen, Johannes W.]] |title=Color Atlas of Anatomy: A Photographic Study of the Human Body |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown, MD |pages=2006. 217 p. |isbn=0-7817-9013-1 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''sagittal'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''[[wikt:sagitta#Latin|sagitta]]'', meaning "arrow". An image of an arrow piercing a body and passing from front (anterior) to back (posterior) on a parabolic [[trajectory of a projectile|trajectory]] would be one way to demonstrate the derivation of the term. Another explanation would be the notching of the [[sagittal suture]] posteriorly by the [[lambdoidal suture]] —similar to feathers on an arrow.
* ''Sagittal axis'' or ''anterior-posterior axis'' is the axis perpendicular to the coronal plane, i.e., the one formed by the intersection of the sagittal and the transversal planes
* ''Coronal axis'', ''medial-lateral axis'', or ''frontal axis'' is the axis perpendicular to the sagittal plane, i.e., the one formed by the intersection of the coronal and the transversal planes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asu.edu/courses/kin335/documents/Movement%20Terminology.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Extension (kinesiology)|Extension]]'' and ''[[flexion]]'' are the movements of limbs within the sagittal plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winslow|first1=Valerie|title=Classic Human Anatomy: The Artist's Guide to Form, Function, and Movement|date=Dec 23, 2008|publisher=Watson-Guptill|isbn=0823024156|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Abduction (kinesiology)|Abduction]]'' and ''[[adduction]]'' are terms for movements of limbs within the [[Coronal plane|coronal]] plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winslow|first1=Valerie|title=Classic Human Anatomy: The Artist's Guide to Form, Function, and Movement|date=Dec 23, 2008|publisher=Watson-Guptill|isbn=0823024156|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speech Buddies''' are a series of [[speech therapy]] tools that are used to remediate articulation and [[speech sound disorder]]s using the widely accepted teaching method of [[tactile feedback]]. Articulation, or speech sound disorders occur when a person has difficulty producing a sound correctly. Sounds may be left off, substituted, added or changed, making it difficult to be understood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/speechsounddisorders.htm |title=Speech Sound Disorders: Articulation and Phonological Processes |publisher=Asha.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Often occurring when children are learning to speak, these errors are considered a disorder if they persist after a certain [[developmental age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingchild.com/speechchart.html |title=What sounds should my child be saying? |publisher=Talkingchild.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; A developmental age at which a child should be able to correctly produce a certain sound is different depending on the difficulty of the sound. The B-sound is one of the first mastered, while the R-sound is more difficult and may not be mastered until several years later.  Most articulation disorders are of no known cause, though many can be attributed to other disorders such as [[autism]], or [[hearing impairment]].

Speech Buddies help treat articulation disorders. There are five different Speech Buddies, each one addressing an individual sound: R, S, L, CH or SH. These tools teach correct [[tongue]] placement when trying to produce problem sounds. This type of learning is called tactile feedback, which uses the sense of touch to promote learning.

Preliminary research results from a single blind [[randomized controlled trial]] suggest that they may increase the speed in which a child can learn to correct his speech sound disorder.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.speech-buddies.com/assets/files/White%20Paper%20SB%20Clincal%20Trial-8-20-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Ongoing research is exploring the use of Speech Buddies to help in other speech therapy applications including foreign [[accent reduction]], [[developmental verbal dyspraxia]], acquired [[apraxia of speech]] from [[stroke]] or [[traumatic brain injury]] (TBI).  Experts have published clinical experiences using Speech Buddies for articulation disorders and apraxia in industry blogs such as Play on Words, Mommy Speech Therapy and traditional publications such as the [[Chicago Tribune]]. On May 31, 2011, Dr. Max Gomez of WCBS-NY reported on how Speech Buddies are being used to reduce overall cost and treatment time of speech therapy.

Speech Buddies were invented by Articulate Technologies, Inc., in [[San Francisco]], CA. Speech Buddies® and Speech Buddy™ are [[trademark]]s of Articulate Technologies, Inc. They are [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] listed [[medical device]]s.

'''Sustainable automotive air conditioning''' is the subject of a debate – nicknamed the ''Cool War'' – about the next-generation [[refrigerant]] in car [[air conditioning]]. The '''Alliance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Solutions''' supports the uptake of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) as a refrigerant in passenger cars, and the chemical industry is developing new chemical blends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance-co2-solutions.org/docs/the_choice.pdf The Choice Today - New Chemical Blends or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alliance and its supporters – scientists, [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] and business leaders – urge the car industry to replace high global warming chemical substances with the [[natural refrigerant]] [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[R744]]/ R-744) in car cooling and heating. This, they argue, would lead to 10% less car emissions, and knock out 1% of total [[greenhouse gas]] emissions worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance-co2-solutions.org/docs/challenge.pdf Car Air Conditioning &amp; the Climate Change Challenge - Made Simple]&lt;/ref&gt; If CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology is applied in other sectors, such as commercial and industrial refrigeration, heat pumps for water heating etc., it may even save up to 3% of the world’s greenhouse gases.

Opponents of the Alliance claim that CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology is not cost-efficient and safe, hence seeking to postpone the global industry decision to be taken to develop new chemical blends instead.

==Background==
The Cool War has emanated from the decision of the European Union to phase out the current high global warming refrigerant [[HFC-134a]] in car air conditioning from January 2011 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/site/en/oj/2006/l_161/l_16120060614en00120018.pdf European Directive 2006/40/EC relating to emissions from air-conditioning systems in motor vehicles]&lt;/ref&gt; To comply with the legislation, carmakers have to decide today on a new refrigerant, as they typically need 3–4 years to develop and introduce a new car platform including the air conditioning system. (It would take much less time to design merely a new air conditioning system to install in a new version of an existing model.) The current total value of the car air conditioning market is estimated to be $14.5 billion in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A shift in car air conditioning technology – Carbon Dioxide Refrigerant|url=http://www.autoairconparts.co.uk/blog/a-shift-in-car-air-conditioning-technology-carbon-dioxide-refrigerant/|publisher=www.autoairconparts.co.uk|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Arguments for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
The Alliance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Solutions and its supporters agree that the refrigerant CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is:

*More environmentally friendly with the lowest [[Global warming potential]] (GWP) of all currently used and proposed refrigerants. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; does not deplete the ozone layer. Since the carbon dioxide used in car air conditioning is a recycled industrial waste product it becomes environmentally neutral.  Overall, using a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based air conditioning system will reduce total car emissions by 10%, thereby sparing the planet 1% of total greenhouse gases.{{cn|date=February 2016}}
*More technically ready because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; models have been developed and tested in all climates, being now ready for mass production. They are faster to heat and cool a car, and show a superior performance in over 90% of all driving conditions.
*More cost-efficient because as a refrigerant itself, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is cheap and worldwide available. The servicing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems will be less costly and less complicated than that for present systems. For the consumer the total cost of ownership is lowest with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as it will significantly cut fuel consumption by the air conditioning device. Carmakers have to make an initial investment estimated at €20 per unit, with no additional costs once CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology enters into mass production.
*Usable in Heat Pumps because at least one CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system under development can act as a [[heat pump]], supplying cabin heat and windshield defrosting even before the engine has warmed up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visteon.com/company/features/081604.html Visteon's R744 system] {{cite web | url=http://www.visteon.com/company/features/081604.html | title=Feature Stories-Company-R744 Climate System | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114205439/http://visteon.com/company/features/081604.html | archivedate=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although the Alliance may not mention it, since CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is so cheap and relatively harmless to the environment, the reservoirs in such systems could store additional liquid R744 to keep a vehicle cool even when the engine (or compressor) was not running.

===Arguments against CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;===
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Technology requires the design of completely new high-pressure systems whereas so-called "drop-in solutions" (the adaptation of current systems to new substances) are potentially more cost-efficient. 

The Alliance for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Solutions claims, however that the initial costs of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; systems will be around €5 higher than drop-in solutions and that over a car’s life cycle, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; air conditioning systems will be more cost-efficient than any currently used or proposed new chemical blends. (see [[#Arguments_for_CO2|Arguments for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]).
{{CO2}} has been classified as Safety Class A1 (low-toxic, non-flammable refrigerant) by the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alliance-co2-solutions.org/docs/ASHRAE_standard.pdf ASHRAE Standard 34]&lt;/ref&gt; – the highest safety class possible.  As the charge of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to the air conditioning systems is very small (200-400 g) there is no realistic danger for the passengers, even in case of accidental release.

===Arguments for non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigerants===

*Refrigerants such as the greenpeace-developed '[[isobutane#Uses|Greenfreeze]]', based on purified [[butane]]/[[propane]] mixtures, are entirely 'natural', and due to increased efficiency over refrigerants such as [[R134a]], allow the use of very small amounts of refrigerant to be used.
*Use of pure hydrocarbon refrigerants, which are 'backward compatible' with even early [[Freon]] (R-12) car air conditioning systems, would allow these systems to be easily converted (without modification), increasing their efficiency, and preventing further release of harmful R-134a and R-12 to the atmosphere.

===Arguments against non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; refrigerants===
Butane and propane are very flammable petroleum products; they are used as fuels for gas [[barbecue]] grills, disposable lighters, etc. Like gasoline, to which it chemically is closely related, propane has a tendency to explode if mixed with oxygen and ignited in an enclosed container.&lt;!-- The next remark is so dubious that I am removing it unless or until a source for the claim is found: However the small quantities should make this risk minimal.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}--&gt;

The use of highly flammable hydrocarbon gases such as butane and propane as automotive refrigerants raises serious safety concerns.  The EPA, in evaluating motor vehicle air conditioning substitutes for CFC-12 (Freon, or R-12) under its SNAP program, has classified as "Unacceptable Substitutes" other "Flammable blend[s] of hydrocarbons" by reason of "insufficient data to demonstrate safety."  The EPA defines "Unacceptable" in this context as "illegal for use as a CFC-12 substitute in motor vehicle air conditioners".  All of the refrigerants which EPA approved for motor vehicle use in place of CFC-12 (as of 28 September 2006) contain no more than 4% total flammable hydrocarbons (butane, isobutane, and/or isopentane).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/refrigerants/macssubs.html#otherinfo EPA: Choosing and Using Alternative Refrigerants for Motor Vehicle Air Conditioning&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it appears unlikely, for safety reasons, that EPA will approve 'Greenfreeze' or similar hydrocarbon-based refrigerants for automotive use.

==Latest and next steps==
In September 2007, the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) officially announced its decision to use CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the refrigerant in next-generation air conditioning. Other carmakers from Europe and the rest of the world may follow the German lead.

A working group at ACEA, the European carmakers’ association, was to be drafting a common position on the issue to be adopted across the whole industry by end-2007.

However, on 9 April 2009, German public television channel ARD aired a report claiming that VDA members would be using loopholes in the law to avoid complying with the EU directive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r744.com/articles/2009-04-10-german-tv-explains-car-industry-boycott-of-eu-law.php German TV explains car industry boycott of EU law]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Religion of the Future''''' is a book by the philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. In the book, he argues that humanity is in need of a religious revolution that dispenses with the concept of God and elements of the supernatural, a revolution that expands individual and collective human empowerment by fostering a condition he calls "deep freedom"—a life of creativity, risk, experiment, and meaningful personal connection—protected by structure-revising social and political structures of an [[empowered democracy]] hospitable to the context-breaking capacities inherent in human life.

==Overview==

===Background and objective===
Unger opens the book by describing the four incurable defects of human life: death, groundlessness, insatiability, and belittlement. The major world religious traditions, although having certain elements in common, have differed in how they have dealt with these four defects of human life. Unger describes three “moments” in the evolution of religious belief: a first moment, when human life was so precarious that the flaws of existence did not occupy a central place in human consciousness; a second moment, when humans had achieved some degree of freedom from dependence on nature, allowing high culture to emerge and address the basic flaws of existence, which were now at the center of human consciousness. A hallmark of this second moment of religious belief was the common feature of religion in assuring believers that everything is alright. For the third moment to occur, Unger argues that a religious revolution is needed, a thoroughly naturalistic development of religious belief which offers no assurance that everything is alright, but offers a heightened, intensified, and more meaningful life in the present, rather than at some indefinitely postponed future time. This “religion of the future” would offer a way of confronting life without illusions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=1-61}}

In the next three chapters, Unger will address each of the three major world religious traditions and explain their shortcomings as inspiration and sources for the religion of the future.

===Critique of religious tradition of "overcoming the world"===
The religious tradition of overcoming the world, chiefly represented by [[Buddhism]] and [[Hinduism]], is marked by a quest for serenity and benevolence. Unger contends that “overcoming the world” cannot serve as a starting point for a future religious revolution, because this tradition seeks a deliberate dimming of consciousness and vitality in its quest for serenity. The religion of the future, Unger contends, must turn toward the world, not away from it, and a religious tradition that denies time and distinction, and urges us to turn away from engagement with the world, cannot be a basis for the religious revolution Unger envisions.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=62-89}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "humanizing the world"===
The tradition of humanizing the world (represented by [[Confucianism]]) is marked by a belief that humans can find their place in the world by embracing an ethic of roles and the ennoblement of our relations with each other through this ethic of roles. Unger contends that this tradition, too, is unsuited to be a starting point for the religion of the future because it gives too much weight and authority to social structures and roles that may match the dispositions only of the most virtuous, conformist members of society. The picture of human morality presented by the tradition of humanizing the world is ultimately unrealistic, Unger contends, and fails to address in a satisfactory manner the flaws in human existence.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=90-120}}

===Critique of religious tradition of "struggling with the world"===
According to Unger, the religious tradition that holds the most promise as a starting point for the religion of the future is the tradition of “struggling with the world,” the semitic salvific religions including [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The tradition of “struggling with the world” also has a secular voice, in the form of the major doctrines of emancipation including [[liberalism]], [[socialism]] and [[democracy]]. The metaphysical vision of the various forms of “struggling with the world” include several points in common:
* There is one real world.
* Time is inclusively real.
* The new can happen.
* History is open.
* The self has unfathomable depth.
* The ordinary has more promise than the high-flown.

At the heart of the doctrine of the “struggle with the world,” both in its religious and secular variants, is a conception of the self as embodied spirit. Unger explains a key aspect of the nature of the embodied spirit is that it can always overflow and exceed its contexts: “There is more in us, in each of us individually and in all of us collectively--the human race--than there is or ever can be in them.” Unger explains how this context-transcending quality of human beings as embodied spirit is manifested in the context of the market economy, in areas of rigorous intellectual inquiry such as mathematics and physics, and in the confrontation of human beings with the enigmas of their experience in the context of religion. In each of these settings, Unger argues, we are not “ever entirely hostage to the social and conceptual worlds that have helped shape us. They may direct us over much of our lives, but they do not own us.”

This view of human nature as irrepressibly context-transcending is at the heart of what Unger finds useful for the religion of the future in the doctrine of the struggle with the world, and it is this element of the doctrine that he embraces as the starting point for his vision of a religion of the future. But he finds that all of its contemporary forms, the tradition of struggling with the world is radically defective.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=121-195}}

===Nature of the religious revolution represented by the religion of the future===
Unger argues that a new religious revolution would be thoroughly naturalistic and would pursue the task of enhancing life now, rather than promising salvation or reward in the indefinite future. Such a revolution would likely contain elements that resemble past religious revolutions such as visionary teaching and exemplary action, but would combined with elements unknown to the religious revolutions of the past. The religious revolution that Unger envisions would have the following qualities:
* It would not centralize prophetic power in a single individual and his decisive action in history.
* It would be concerned both with reshaping society as well as reorienting individual life.
* It would include a vision for the cumulative transformation of society that would not be reducible to a definite blueprint or formula.
* It would seek to remedy our condition of estrangement from the present moment, recognizing that time is our most precious possession, and that religion must help us transform our lives now, if only in fragmentary and inchoate form, no matter what changes are sought in the structure of society in historical time.
* It would reject the taboo on the religious criticism of religion.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=194-289}}

===Unger's conception of "deep freedom" and the social and political changes that would help bring it about===
Unger sets forth the structural changes in society that would be necessary to foster the emancipatory conditions of the religion of the future, to make society more open to experiment, fulfillment, connection, and surprise. At the heart of his political proposals in this chapter is the general concept of “structure-revising structure,” and the various ways that this can be embodied in political and social institutions. Unger’s vision for politics in this chapter includes “heating up” the political process, creating institutional mechanisms for breaking impasse between branches of government, and increasing mass mobilization of citizens so that all have a voice in the direction and operation of government.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=290-340}}

===Quality of human life under the religion of the future===
Unger speculates on the quality that life would have under the regime instituted by a future religious revolution. Individuals would become freer to innovate, experiment, take risks, and look for trouble. Connections between people would be deeper and more meaningful. Social mechanisms and safety nets would be in place that would allow and encourage this climate of experiment, risk, cooperation and love.{{sfn|Unger|2014|pp=341-444}}

==Reception==
Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in the ''[[Journal of the American Academy of Religion]]'', Andrew B. Irvine wrote that “the book demands to be read not as a contribution to scholarly debate but as a direct intervention in the most important and urgent issues of today …  No review could cover all the angles from which this book deserves to be appreciated—and criticized.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=554}} Irvine contends that Unger’s argument  “dramatically ...simplifies the indefinitely complex data of religion, but it does so in the name of a single religious perspective.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine asks: “What would this book look like if it were more deeply comparative and/or interreligious in its thinking? It is comparative and interreligious, of course, but Unger’s exclusivistic affirmation of the ‘struggle with the world’ seems insufficiently informed.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=567}} Irvine concludes his review by applauding ''The Religion of the Future'', stating that it “merits reading by philosophers, theologians, and activists, especially any who hold that a naturalistic metaphysics and praxis are vital to a flourishing human future. Its weaknesses are as instructive as its strengths.”{{sfn|Irvine|2015|p=568}}

Bonaventure Chapman, writing in the Catholic publication ''Dominicana'', described ''The Religion of the Future'' as “a prophetic vision of any future religion,”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=11}} and stated that he considered the book, alongside [[Ronald Dworkin]]’s ''Religion Without God'', to be an example of “religious atheism,” that is, a “new attitude to God” that “presents a new horizon for Christianity.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}} While strongly criticizing the book from a theistic standpoint, Chapman allows that this new religious atheism may represent a “maturing of the infantile atheism offered by the scientific naturalism perspective: it looks at the world and finds moral truth, objective value, and goodness.”{{sfn|Chapman|2014|p=22}}

Reviewing ''The Religion of the Future'' in ''[[Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews]]'', Jeremy David Bendik-Keymer considered the book as the second part of the project that Unger began in ''[[The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound]]'' and concluded in ''[[The Singular Universe and the Reality of Time]]''. Bendik-Keymer summarizes Unger’s project in these works as one that “seeks a world in which we live in the present, free of repression of, or reactive attitudes towards, the existential limitations of being human and in which we act collectively to create the conditions for ongoing innovation and self-transformation” (internal citations omitted). Bendik-Keymer complains that Unger’s depiction of human beings is “belittling” and concludes that Unger “has simply missed the mark… Unger may think of his work as preparation for prophesy, but it ends up as pontification.”{{sfn|Bendik-Keymer|2014}}

==Quotes==

- p.236

{{quote|The category of religion lacks any permanent core. There is no set way in which the aspects of our experience that we designate as religious relate to other aspects. That the category of religion is historical, however, does not mean that it is empty of content. Its powers of discrimination are those that the history of mankind gives it. Each major change in the content of religion inspires a change in our idea of what the term most usefully designates.}}

- p.314

{{quote|Deep freedom is therefore freedom, grasped and realized through change of institutions and practices: not just through a one-time change but through a practice that can generate future, ongoing change in the institutional order of society. Deep freedom is thus also freedom as understood within the bounds of what I earlier described as the conception of a free society. The idea of deep freedom develops through an interplay between the conception of a free society and the institutional arrangements required to make that conception real. The conception informs the making of the institutional alternatives. The making of the alternative prompts us to enrich and revise the conception.}}

- p.349

{{quote|Our comprehensive conceptions of our identity, viewed in relation to our place in nature, are not, in this account, to be understood as merely or chiefly conjectures about a natural phenomenon, as if human nature were a thing. They do not resemble the thinking that produced the standard model of particle physics or the periodic table. They are prophecies, indeed imperfectly self-fulfilling prophecies, as I have argued in my defense of the concept of religion.}}
