      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20540">In the pre-modern tradition, the '''aesthetics of music''' or '''musical aesthetics''' explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]. Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

The critic uses a range of aesthetic evaluation tools to write their review. They may assess the tone of the orchestra, the tempos that the conductor chose for the symphony movements, the taste and judgement showed by the conductor in their creative choices, and even the selection of pieces which formed the concert program.]]

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of [[philosophy]]. In the 20th century, important contributions to the aesthetics of music were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and [[musicologist]], and composer [[Richard Wagner]] regarding whether instrumental music could communicate emotions to the listener. Wagner and his disciples argued that instrumental music could communicate emotions and images; composers who held this belief wrote instrumental [[tone poem]]s, which attempted to tell a story or depict a landscape using instrumental music. Hanslick and his partisans asserted that instrumental music is simply patterns of sound that do not communicate any emotions or images. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a system of tuning called [[just intonation]].

Since ancient times, it has been thought that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in ''The Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime, music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

== History: Aesthetics and European classical music ==

=== 18th century ===
In the 18th century, music was considered so far outside the realm of aesthetic theory (then conceived of in visual terms) that music was barely mentioned in [[William Hogarth]]'s treatise ''[[The Analysis of Beauty]]''. He considered [[dance]] beautiful (closing the treatise with a discussion of the minuet), but treated music important only insofar as it could provide the proper accompaniment for the dancers.

However, by the end of the century, people began to distinguish the topic of music and its own beauty from music as part of a mixed media, as in opera and dance. [[Immanuel Kant]], whose ''Critique of Judgment'' is generally considered the most important and influential work on aesthetics in the 18th century, argued that instrumental music is beautiful but ultimately trivial. Compared to the other fine arts, it does not engage the understanding sufficiently, and it lacks moral purpose. To display the combination of genius and taste that combines ideas and beauty, Kant thought that music must be combined with words, as in song and opera.

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the era of [[romanticism]] in music, some composers and critics argued that music should and could express ideas, images, emotions, or even a whole literary plot. Challenging Kant's reservations about instrumental music, in 1813 [[E. T. A. Hoffman]] argued that music was fundamentally the art of instrumental composition. Five years later, [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]'s ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' argued that instrumental music is the greatest art, because it is uniquely capable of representing the metaphysical organization of reality.

Although the Romantic movement accepted the thesis that instrumental music has representational capacities, most did not support Schopenhauer's linking of music and metaphysics. The mainstream consensus endorsed music's capacity to represent particular emotions and situations. In 1832, composer [[Robert Schumann]] stated that his piano work [[Papillons]] was "intended as a musical representation" of the final scene of a novel by [[Jean Paul]], ''[[Flegeljahre]]''. The thesis that the value of music is related to its representational function was vigorously countered by the [[Formalism (music)|formalism]] of [[Eduard Hanslick]], setting off the "War of the Romantics."

This fight divided the aesthetics into two competing groups: On one side are formalists (e.g., Hanslick), who emphasize that the rewards of music are found in appreciation of musical form or design, while on the other side are the anti-formalists, such as [[Richard Wagner]], who regarded musical form as a means to other artistic ends.

=== 20th century ===
A group of [[modernism|modernist]] writers in the early 20th century (including the poet [[Ezra Pound]]) believed that music was essentially pure because it didn't represent anything, or make reference to anything beyond itself. In a sense, they wanted to bring poetry closer to Hanslick's ideas about the autonomous, self-sufficient character of music. (Bucknell 2002) Dissenters from this view notably included [[Albert Schweitzer]], who argued against the alleged 'purity' of music in a classic work on [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]. Far from being a new debate, this disagreement between modernists and their critics was a direct continuation of the 19th-century debate about the autonomy of music.

Among 20th-century composers, [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the most prominent composer to defend the modernist idea of musical autonomy. When a composer creates music, Stravinsky claims, the only relevant thing "is his apprehension of the contour of the form, for the form is everything. He can say nothing whatever about meanings" (Stravinsky 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;115). Although listeners often look for meanings in music, Stravinsky warned that these are distractions from the musical experience.

The most distinctive development in the aesthetics of music in the 20th century was that attention was directed at the distinction between 'higher' and 'lower' music, now understood to align with the distinction between [[art music]] and [[popular music]], respectively. [[Theodor Adorno]] suggested that culture industries churn out a debased mass of unsophisticated, sentimental products that have replaced more 'difficult' and critical art forms that might lead people to actually question social life. [[False consciousness|False needs]] are cultivated in people by the culture industries. These needs can be both created and satisfied by the capitalist system, and can replace people's 'true' needs: freedom, full expression of human potential and creativity, and genuine creative happiness. Thus, those trapped in the false notions of beauty according to a capitalist mode of thinking can only hear beauty in dishonest terms (citation necessary). 

Beginning with [[Peter Kivy]]'s work in the 1970s, [[analytic philosophy]] has contributed extensively to the aesthetics of music. Analytic philosophy pays very little attention to the topic of musical beauty. Instead, Kivy inspired extensive debate about the nature of emotional expressiveness in music. He also contributed to the debate over the nature of authentic performances of older music arguing that much of the debate was incoherent because it failed to distinguish among four distinct standards of [[authentic performance]] of music (1995).

=== Bad music ===
[[Simon Frith]] (2004, p.&amp;nbsp;17-9) argues that, "'bad music' is a necessary concept for musical pleasure, for musical aesthetics." He distinguishes two common kinds of bad music: the Worst Records Ever Made type, which include "Tracks which are clearly incompetent musically; made by singers who can't sing, players who can't play, producers who can't produce," and "Tracks involving genre confusion. The most common examples are actors or TV stars recording in the latest style." Another type of "bad music" is "rock critical lists," such as "Tracks that feature sound gimmicks that have outlived their charm or novelty" and "Tracks that depend on false sentiment [...], that feature an excess of feeling molded into a radio-friendly pop song."

Frith gives three common qualities attributed to bad music: inauthentic, [in] bad taste (see also: [[kitsch]]), and stupid. He argues that "The marking off of some tracks and genres and artists as 'bad' is a necessary part of popular music pleasure; it is a way we establish our place in various music worlds. And 'bad' is a key word here because it suggests that aesthetic and ethical judgements are tied together here: not to like a record is not just a matter of taste; it is also a matter of argument, and argument that matters" (p.&amp;nbsp;28). Frith's analysis of popular music is based in sociology.

=== Philosophical aesthetics of popular music ===
[[Theodor Adorno]] was a prominent philosopher who wrote on the aesthetics of popular music. A [[Marxist]], Adorno was extremely hostile to popular music. His theory was largely formulated in response to the growing popularity of American music in Europe between World War I and World War II. As a result, Adorno often uses "jazz" as his example of what he believed was wrong with popular music; however, for Adorno this term included everyone from [[Louis Armstrong]] to [[Bing Crosby]]. He attacked popular music claiming that it is simplistic and repetitive, and encourages a fascist mindset (1973, p.&amp;nbsp;126).

However good or bad it sounds to its audience, he believed that music is genuinely good only if it challenges society through its role as an inaccessible Other. This function is advanced by musical structure, rather than lyrics. In his opinion, although many popular musicians seem to superficially oppose the political status quo, the use of familiar song forms and the artist's involvement in capitalism results in music that ultimately encourages the audience to accept things as they are - only radically [[experimental music]] can encourage audiences to become critical of prevailing society. However, the [[mass media]] cannot handle the confrontational nature of good music, and offers instead a steady diet of recycled, simplified and politically ineffective music.

Besides Adorno, Theodore Gracyk provides the most extensive philosophical analysis of popular music. He argues that conceptual categories and distinctions developed in response to art music are systematically misleading when applied to popular music (1996). At the same time, the social and political dimensions of popular music do not deprive it of aesthetic value (2007).

In 2007 musicologist and journalist [[Craig Schuftan]] published ''The Culture Club'', a book drawing links between [[modernism]] art movements and popular music of today and that of past decades and even centuries. His story involves drawing lines between [[art]], or [[high culture]], and pop, or [[low culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.illiterarty.com/reviews/book-review-culture-club-craig-schuftan&lt;/ref&gt; A more scholarly study of the same topic, ''Between Montmartre and the Mudd Club: Popular Music and the Avant-Garde'', was published five years earlier by philosopher Bernard Gendron.

In Germany, the musicologist [[Ralf von Appen]] (2007) has published a book on the aesthetics of popular music that focuses on everyday judgments of popular records. He analyzes the structures and aesthetic categories behind judgments found on amazon.com concerning records by musicians such as Bob Dylan, Eminem, Queens of the Stone Age etc. In a second step, von Appen interprets these findings on the basis of current theoretical positions in the field of philosophical aesthetics.

'''''Alltagsgeschichte''''' is a form of [[microhistory]] that was particularly prevalent amongst German historians during the 1980s. It was founded by historians [[Alf Luedtke]] and [[:de:Hans Medick|Hans Medick]].

The name comes from German, where ''Alltag'' means "everyday life"; it can thus be roughly translated as "everyday history". In this sense, ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can be considered part of the wider Marxian historical school of '[[People's history|history from below]]'. 

The purpose of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' is to find and prove the links between the down-to-earth, everyday, basic experiences of ordinary people in a society, and the broad social and political changes which occur in that society. Because this is such a massively broad endeavour to undertake, it can only feasibly be practised on the most minute of scales. Thus ''Alltagsgeschichte'' becomes a form of microhistory.

Its leading exponents include [[Paul Veyne]] and Michel Rouche in France, and Peter Carr in the United Kingdom. ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can also be linked to the Italian historical doctrine of ''Microstoria'' (microhistory).

The '''Bimaran casket''' or '''Bimaran reliquary''' is a small gold [[reliquary]] for Buddhist relics that was found inside the [[stupa]] no.2 at [[Bimaran]], near [[Jalalabad]] in eastern [[Afghanistan]].

==Discovery==
[[File:Stupa 2 Bimaran Charles Masson.jpg|thumb|left|The Stupa Nb.2 at [[Bimaran]], where the reliquary was excavated. Drawing by [[Charles Masson]].]]
When it was found by the archaeologist [[Charles Masson]] during his work in [[Afghanistan]] between 1833 and 1838, the casket contained coins of the [[Indo-Scythian]] king [[Azes II]], though recent research by Senior indicates Azes II never existed&lt;ref&gt;Senior (2008), pp. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt; and finds attributed to his reign probably should be reassigned to [[Azes I]]. The most recent research however (2015) attributes the coins to Indo-Scythian king [[Kharahostes]] or his son [[Mujatria]], who minted posthumous issues in the name of Azes.&lt;ref name="Joe Cribb"/&gt;

The Bimaran reliquary is sometimes dated, based on coinage analysis, to 0-15 CE ([[Fussman]]), more generally to 50-60 CE ([[British Museum]]), and sometimes much later (2nd century CE), based on artistic assumptions only. It is currently in the collections of the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/b/bimaran_reliquary.aspx British Museum Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The datation of this unique piece of art has a strong bearing on the chronology of [[Buddhist art]] and the creation of the [[Buddha]] image, as its advanced iconography implies that earlier forms had probably been existing for quite some time before.

==Description==
[[Image:BuddhaDetail2.JPG|thumb|200px|Detail of the Buddha, where the rare posture and light dress are visible.]]
The casket is a small container reminiscent of the [[Pyxis (vessel)|Pyxis]] of the [[Classical world]].&lt;ref name="Crossroads"&gt;"The crossroads of Asia", edited by Ellizabeth Errington and [[Joe Cribb]], The ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, {{ISBN|0951839918}}, p.189-190&lt;/ref&gt; It was found without its lid.&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt; There is a lotus decorating the bottom.&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt;

The casket features [[hellenistic]] representations of the Buddha ([[contrapposto]] pose, Greek [[himation]], bundled hairstyle, wearing a [[moustache]], realistic execution),&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt; surrounded by the Indian deities [[Brahma (Buddhism)|Brahma]] and [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]], inside arched niches (called "homme arcade", or ''caitya'') of [[Greco-Roman]] architecture. There are altogether eight figures in high-relief (two identical groups of Brahman-Buddha-Indra, and two devotees or [[Bodhisattvas]] in-between) and two rows of [[rubies]] from [[Badakhshan]].&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt;

Owing to their necklace, bracelets, and armbands, and [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]], the two devotees are most probably representations of [[Bodhisattvas]].&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt; They hold their hands together in a prayerful gesture of reverence, ''[[Añjali Mudrā]]''.&lt;ref name="Crossroads"/&gt;

The casket is made in gold-[[repoussé]] and is very small, with a height of {{convert|7|cm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}}. It is considered as a masterpiece of the [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]].

===The Buddha: a rare iconography===
The Buddha seems to walk sideways. His right forearm goes across his chest to form the Abhaya mudra. His left fist is clenched on his hip. The gown of the Shakyamuni Buddha is quite light compared to that of the other known representations of the standing Buddha (see [[Standing Buddha (Tokyo National Museum)]]), tending to follow the outline of the body, in a rather light way. These are probably the first two layers of monastic clothing the ''[[antaravasaka]]'' and the ''[[uttarasanga]]'', without the heavier overcoat, the ''[[sangati]]'', which would only go as low as the knees and be more markedly folded. Also, his gown is folded over the right and left arm (rather than being held in the left hand as in the classical Buddha image), suggesting some kind of scarf-like ''[[uttariya]]''. He has an abundant topknot covering the [[ushnisha]], and a simple [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] surrounds his head. This combination of details of the iconography (posture and clothing) is rare and only otherwise known in the coins of [[Kanishka]] (c. 150 CE), where they bear the inscription "[[Shakyamuni Buddha]]", in apparent contrast to his coins of the "Buddha" where he wears the heavy topcoat. The posture itself is well known in the art of Gandhara in sculptures of the Buddha as a Bodhisattva, but in these cases, he wears the Indian princely [[dhoti]] and the royal turban.

==Steatite container==
[[Image:SteatiteContainer.JPG|thumb|left|The steatite box that contained the Bimaran casket.]]
[[File:Bimaran vase inscriptions.jpg|thumb|Inscriptions on the steatite box.]]
The Bimaran casket was kept in a [[steatite]] box, with inscriptions stating that it contained some relics of the Buddha. When opened in the 19th century, the box did not contain identifiable relics, but instead some burnt pearls, bead of precious and semi-precious stones, and the four coins of [[Azes II]].

The inscriptions written on the box are {{ref|box}}:

:Main body of the container:
:''"Shivaraksita mumjavamdaputrasa danamuhe niyadide bhagavata sharirehi sarvabudhana puyae"''
:"Sacred gift of ''Shivaraksita'', son of ''Munjavamda''; presented for Lord's relics, in honour of all Buddhas" (Translation by Fussman)

:Lid of the container:
:''"Shivaraksita mumjavamdaputrasa danamuhe bhagavata sharirehi"''
:"Gift of ''Shivaraksita'', son of ''Munjavamda''; presented for Lord's relics"

==Date of the coins==

===Azes II===
[[Image:Coins of Azes I inside the Bimaran casket.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|The coins of [[Azes II]] found inside the Bimaran reliquary.]]
[[File:Charles Masson coin.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|One of the coins of the Bimaran casket, illustrated by [[Charles Masson]].&lt;ref&gt;A memoir on the buildings called topes. In Ariana Antiqua: A descriptive account of the antiquities and coins of Afghanistan, [[Charles Masson]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=0LgWAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=71]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Crossroads of Asia, p.188&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''Obv.''' [[Azes]] riding,  with corrupted Greek legend (WEIΛON WEOΛΛWN IOCAAC) for ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΑΖΟΥ "King of Kings [[Azes]]", and Buddhist [[Triratna]] symbol behind the head of the king.&lt;br&gt;'''Rev.''' City goddess [[Tyche]] standing left holding cornucopia and raised right hand. [[Kharoshthi]] legend ''Maharajasa mahatasa Dhramakisa Rajatirajasa Ayasa'' "The Great king follower of the [[Dharma]], King of Kings [[Azes]]".&lt;/small&gt;]]
The archeological find of the [[Azes II]] coins inside the casket would suggest a date between 30 BCE to 10 BCE. Azes II would have employed some [[Indo-Greek]] artists in the territories recently conquered, and made the dedication to a stupa. The coins are not very worn, and would therefore have been dedicated soon after their minting. Indo-Scythians are indeed known for their association with Buddhism, as in the [[Mathura lion capital]]. Such date would make the casket the earliest known representation of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]:

:''"In the art of Gandhara, the first known image of the standing Buddha and approximatively dated, is that of the Bimaran reliquary, which specialists attribute to the Indo-Scythian period, more particularly to the rule of [[Azes II]]"'' (Christine Sachs, "De l'Indus à l'Oxus").

However, several features of the coins are unknown for coins of Azes: the [[Tyche]] on the reverse, the fact that the king is given the title of ''Dhramika'' in the [[Kharoshthi]] inscription on the reverse, and the fact that the Kharoshthi monograms and symbols used are those of the later Scythian king [[Kharahostes]].&lt;ref name="Errington16"/&gt;

===Kharahostes===
[[File:Kharahostes Northern Satrap with Azes and Tyche Nandipada behind king.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Coin of [[Kharahostes]], in the name of [[Azes]].&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;'''Obv.''' [[Azes]] riding,  with corrupted Greek legend (WEIΛON WEOΛΛWN IOCAAC) for ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ ΑΖΟΥ "King of Kings [[Azes]]", and Buddhist [[Triratna]] symbol behind the head of the king.&lt;br&gt;'''Rev.''' City goddess [[Tyche]] standing left holding cornucopia and raised right hand. [[Kharoshthi]] legend ''Maharajasa mahatasa Dhramakisa Rajatirajasa Ayasa'' "The Great king followower of the [[Dharma]], King of Kings [[Azes]]"&lt;/small&gt;]]
The latest studies, made in 2015 by [[Joe Cribb]], consider that the coins are issues of [[Kharahostes]], or his son [[Mujatria]].&lt;ref name="Joe Cribb"&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/15209723/DATING_AND_LOCATING_MUJATRIA_AND_THE_TWO_KHARAHOSTES DATING AND LOCATING MUJATRIA AND THE TWO KHARAHOSTES] by Joe Cribb, 2015, p.27 et sig&lt;/ref&gt; Many characteristics of the coins of the Bimaran reliquary are consistent with the coinage of [[Kharahostes]] (10 BCE&amp;ndash;10 CE), a successor to Azes II, who minted many coins in the name of Azes II.&lt;ref name="Errington16"/&gt;

The four coins in the Bimaran casket are of the same type: [[tetradrachm]]s of debased silver in the name of Azes, in near-new condition.&lt;ref name="Errington188"&gt;The Crossroads of Asia, Elizabeth Errington, Ancient India and Iran Trust, Fitzwilliam Museum, Ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, p.188&lt;/ref&gt; On the obverse they show a king on a horse to the right with right hand extended, with a three-pellet dynastic mark and a circular legend in Greek.&lt;ref name="Errington188"/&gt; The legend reads in corrupted Greek WEIΛON WEOΛΛWN [[Azes II|IOCAAC]] (that is, ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΝ [[Azes II|ΑΖΟΥ]]) "King of Kings [[Azes]]". On the reverse appears a figure of [[Tyche]] standing and holding a [[cornucopia]], with a [[Kharoshthi]] legend.&lt;ref name="Errington188"/&gt; The legend reads 'Maharajasa mahatasa Dhramakisa Rajatirajasa Ayasa'' "The Great king followower of the [[Dharma]], King of Kings [[Azes]]".

Close-up photographs by the [[British Museum]][http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details/collection_image_gallery.aspx?partid=1&amp;assetid=273118001&amp;objectid=182959] show that the coins do bear the name of Azes, but that they also have the "Three pellets" symbol, which is characteristic of the coinage of Kharahostes, who also often uses the name of Azes on his coinage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://grifterrec.rasmir.com/indoscythian/indoscythian_2.html Grifterrec on Indo-Scythians]&lt;/ref&gt; The coin type of the Bimaran coins is also identical to the main coins of Kharahostes (horseman with Tyche).

The name of Kharahostes has also been recently discovered on a silver Buddhist reliquary, found in Shinkot in [[Bajaur]] ([[Pakistan]]). This suggests that Kharahostes was keen on making Buddhist dedications similar to those of the Bimaran reliquary.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Salomon, "An Inscribed Silver Buddhist Reliquary of the Time of King Kharaosta and Prince Indravarman", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 116, No. 3 (July - September 1996), pp. 418-452&lt;/ref&gt;

Without adding any redeposition theory, the Bimaran reliquary may therefore have been dedicated during the reign of Kharahostes (10 BCE – 10 CE), and probably at the beginning of his reign since the coins are not worn and where therefore basically new when they were introduced in the casket. This would put the Bimaran casket at 10 BCE, or around the beginning of our era.

===Kujula Kadphises===
[[File:Kujula Kadphises. Laureate Julio-Claudian style.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|The rare coins of [[Kujula Kadphises]] with a tripartite mark resembling the three-pellet mark of [[Kharahostes]] (here on the reverse), have coin types ("Laureate head and king seated") which are totally different from those of the Bimaran reliquary. And this is the only issue of Kujula where this symbol appears&lt;ref name="Grifterrec"&gt;[http://grifterrec.rasmir.com/kushan/kushan.html Grifterrec Coins]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[Kushan]] ruler [[Kudjula Kadphises]] does use something similar to the three-pellets mark of Kharahostes in just one of his coin types (the "Laureate head and king seated" type), which has led to suggestions that the coins of the Bimaran casket may be from his reign, and can be dated to approximately 60 CE.&lt;ref name="Errington16"&gt;The Crossroads of Asia, Elizabeth Errington, Ancient India and Iran Trust, Fitzwilliam Museum, Ancient India and Iran Trust, 1992, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; This coin type however has nothing to do with that of the coins of the Bimaran reliquary (which are all "Horseman with Tyche"). Kudjula Kadphises is also not known to have issued Scythian-type coins in the name of Azes.

The three-pellet symbol mark is not know from any other ruler either (apart from the son of Kharahostes [[Mujatria]]),&lt;ref name="Grifterrec"/&gt; so that the only remaining possibility seems to be [[Kharahostes]] or his son, as determined by Joe Cribb in his 2015 study.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/15209723/DATING_AND_LOCATING_MUJATRIA_AND_THE_TWO_KHARAHOSTES DATING AND LOCATING MUJATRIA AND THE TWO KHARAHOSTES] by Joe Cribb, 2015, p.27-35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date of the Bimaran reliquary==
Various disputes have been arising regarding the early date suggested for this first Buddha image.

[[Gérard Fussman|Fussman]] thinks that the Bimaran reliquary was manufactured in 1-15 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Fussman, 1986, p.71, quoted in The Crossroads of Asia, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; In any case manufacture necessarily took place before 60 CE, which is the latest date considered for the coins.&lt;ref&gt;The Crossroads of Asia, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; The Bimaran casket is on display at the [[British Museum]] (Joseph E. Hotung Gallery), which dates the casket to 60 CE.

Some also date the casket as late as the 2nd century CE based on stylistic assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;(S. L. Huntington, ''Art Journal'', Vol. 49 No. 4 Winter.1990, pp.401-408)&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Huntington sums up the issue:

:''"The well-known gold and ruby reliquary found at Bimaran in Afghanistan is generally assigned a date of about the second century AD in spite of the virtually incontrovertible scientific evidence surrounding it that suggests that it was made about the first century BC. The resistance to the early dating of the reliquary is based solely on the assumption that Buddha images were not introduced into the Buddhist artistic repertoire until the early centuries of the Christian era, and therefore that any work that bears an image of the Buddha must be of a comparably late date."'' (S. L. Huntington, ''Art Journal'', Vol. 49 No. 4 Winter.1990, pp.401-408)

These disputes stem from the fact that the first representations of the Buddha are generally assumed to be around the 1st century CE or later, about fifty to a hundred years later than the reign of Azes II, under the rule of the [[Kushans]]. Since the Bimaran casket, with its already advanced Buddhist iconography, was manufactured at the beginning of our era, give or take a few decades,  it is highly probably that much earlier images of the Buddha had already been in existence before its creation, going back to the 1st century BCE.

==Implications==
[[File:Greek Gods and Dharmachakra.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Early Buddhist imagery includes coins of [[Indo-Greek]] kings such as [[Menander II]] (left, circa 90–85 BCE), in which [[Zeus]], through [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], hands a [[wreath]] of victory to a [[Dharmachakra|Wheel of the Law]], or the [[Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin]] (right, 1st c.BCE-1st c.CE).]]
Since the casket already displays quite a sophisticated iconography (Brahma and Indra as attendants, Bodhisattvas) in an advanced style, it would suggest much earlier representations of the Buddha had been current by the time of the deposition of the Bimaran casket (10 BCE -10 CE), going back to the rule of the [[Indo-Greeks]] in the 1st century BCE. The last Indo-Greek kings [[Strato II]] and [[Strato III]] ruled until around 20 CE. This view, that Greco-Buddhist art already was flourishing in the 1st century BCE under the sponsorship of Indo-Greek kings, was originally advocated by [[Alfred A. Foucher]] and others, although with much less archaeological evidence.

Stylistically, the casket (gold inlaid with precious stone) is also highly consistent with the art of the Scythians, as known for example from the [[Tillya tepe]] archaeological site in northern Afghanistan. The Tillya tepe treasure is also dated to the 1st century BCE, and also has what could be early representations of the Buddha, such as the [[Tillya Tepe Buddhist coin]].

The Bimaran casket also has some similarities with the [[Kanishka casket]], which however is of much coarser execution, and securely dated to around 127 CE.

There are varied and nuanced understandings of the precise nature of a Buddha expressed in the different Buddhist traditions and movements.

==Theravada==

===Basic View: Buddha was a Perfect Human Being===
[[Theravada]] Buddhists base their view of the Buddha on the [[Pali Canon]], which appear to be the oldest surviving Buddhist scriptures. From the accounts contained in the Pali Canon emerges the view that Buddha was a human being &amp;mdash; a perfected human being. Buddha was also possessed of all the various supernatural powers, and mastered these to the greatest extent possible ([[Digha Nikaya]] 11: Kevatta Sutta). The body and mind of a Buddha (while alive) are impermanent and changing, just like the body and mind of ordinary people. A Buddha does recognize the unchanging nature of the Dharma, which is an eternal principle, and an unconditioned and timeless phenomenon.

When Buddha died at the age of 80, his body and mind both came to an end. After death, the state of Buddha is undefinable ([[Majjhima Nikaya|MN 22]]). However, a Buddha definitely does not experience [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] after death, but experiences the attainment of [[Parinibbana]] (the ultimate [[Nirvana]]). There is thus an end to the life-continuity of rebirths succeeding one another (this is one of the meanings of [[samsara]]).

In Theravada, a Buddha is not regarded as a [[god]] nor as having created the universe or ruling over it.

===Meaning of 'Whoever Sees the Dharma Sees Me'===
Theravada Buddhism interprets the statement by Buddha that "whoever sees the Dharma sees me (that is; the Buddha)"&lt;ref&gt;Pali Canon, S III.XXII.87(5.5) / S III.120&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of the whole conversation which the Buddha held on that occasion. The goal of this teaching was to make clear that the physical body of the Buddha is not the essence of his being, and that seeing his body doesn't tell you much about him at all. Even when one is sitting next to him, if one doesn't know his teaching (or sees the truth he discovered: [[Dharma]]), one is really far from him. But when one sees the Dharma, even if one is very far away, it is as if one is very close to him, because one really sees what Buddhahood is about. According to the Theravada tradition, the context of the teaching thus does not support any claim for the Buddha to have meant that his existence is God-like (permanent, unchanging, timeless), which is how this sentence is sometimes interpreted in Mahayana Buddhism.

==Early Buddhist Schools==

===Sarvastivada===

====Dharmakāya====
{{Main|Dharmakaya}}

====Vipāka-kāya / Rūpa-kāya====

====Nirmāna-kāya====

===Mahāsānghika===
According to the descriptions of sectarian tenets by [[Vasumitra]], [[Bhavaviveka]] and [[Vinitadeva]], the main [[Mahāsāmghika|Mahāsānghika]] theses, apparently also held in common by all the [[Mahāsānghika]] sub-groups, concerning the nature of Buddhas were:
* Buddhas are supramundane.
* Buddhas are devoid of all impurities (''anāsrava'') and mundane qualities.
* Buddhas preach the Dharma with every verbal utterance they make.
* Buddhas can express all elements of the Dharma by uttering a single sound.
* The material body (''rūpakāya'') of Buddhas is unlimited (''anatman'')
* The supernatural powers (''prabhāva'') of Buddhas are unlimited.
* The longevity of Buddhas is unlimited.
* In order to convert beings and to generate pure faith within them, Buddhas have no thought of satiation
* Buddhas neither sleep nor dream
* Buddhas reply to questions without the need for reflection.
* Buddhas never actually utter any words since they abide in eternal [[samādhi]] or meditative concentration, but beings perceive words to have been uttered.
* Buddhas understand all things with one momentary thought.
* Buddhas know all things because insight or ''prajñā'' is conjoined to that one momentary thought.
* The knowledge of cessation and of non-arising in the future are sustained continuously in Buddhas until they enter [[parinirvāna]].
* There are Buddhas dwelling in all directions of the compass.

==Mahayana==

===Early Mahayana===

===Mid-period Mahayana===

====Eternal Buddha====
{{main|Eternal Buddha}}
An important doctrine that flourished during the middle period of the unfolding of the Mahayana - and is still important today amongst certain Mahayana schools of Buddhism - is that of the Buddha's immortality and eternity. The idea of an eternal Buddha is a notion popularly associated with the Mahayana scripture, the [[Lotus Sutra]], which was written down about 500 years after [[Shakyamuni]]`s preaching of it.. The Lotus Sutra has the Buddha indicating that he became awakened countless, immeasurable, inconceivable trillions of aeons ("kalpas") ago and that his lifetime is "forever existing and immortal". The sutra itself, however, does not directly employ the phrase "eternal Buddha"; yet similar notions are found in other Mahayana scriptures, notably the [[Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], which presents the Buddha as the ultimately real, eternal ("nitya"/ "śāśvata"), unchanging, blissful, pure Self (Atman) who, as the [[Dharmakaya]], knows of no beginning or end. The notion of an eternal Buddha perhaps finds resonance with the earlier idea of eternal Dharma/Nirvana, of which the Buddha is said to be an embodiment.

While Theravada Buddhism holds back from stating that the Buddha is eternal and emphasises all-round impermanence, some expressions of Mahayana Buddhism, however, regard such an understanding as incomplete. The [[Tathagatagarbha]] sutras provide an allegedly culminational doctrine of a pure Selfhood (the eternal yet ungraspable hypostasis of the Buddha) which no longer generates karma and which subsists eternally in the realm of Nirvana, from which sphere help to suffering worldly beings can be sent forth in the forms of various transitory physical Buddhas ("nirmānakāyas"). While the bodies of these corporeal Buddhas are subject to disease, decline and death - like all impermanent things - the salvational Tathagata or Dharmakaya behind them is forever free from impairment, impermanence and mortality. It is this transcendent yet immanent Dharmakaya-Buddha which is taught in certain major Mahayana sutras to be immutable and eternal and is intimately linked with Dharma itself. According to the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]], worldly beings fail to see this eternality of the Buddha and his Dharma. The Buddha declares in that latter Mahayana sutra, which presents itself as the last and most definitive of all sutras: "I say that those who do not know that the Tathagata [Buddha] is eternal are the foremost of the congenitally blind."

====''Buddha-dhatu'' theories====
{{main|Buddha nature}}
'''Buddha-nature''' ([[Classical Chinese]]: 佛性, modern [[pinyin]] ''fó xìng'', literally corresponds to the [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], ''Buddha-dhatu'' - "Buddha Element", "Buddha-Principle", but seems to have been used most frequently to translate the Sanskrit ''[[Tathagatagarbha doctrine|Tathāgata-garbha]]'', meaning "Buddha Matrix", which would be more directly translated into Chinese as 如来蔵) is a doctrine important for many schools of [[Mahayana]] [[Buddhism]]. The Buddha Nature or Buddha Principle (''Buddha-dhatu'') is taught to be a truly real, but internally hidden immortal potency or element within the purest depths of the mind, present in all [[sentience|sentient]] beings, for [[bodhi|awakening]] and becoming a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]].

====Trikaya theories====
{{Main|Trikaya}}
The ''Trikaya'' doctrine ([[Sanskrit]], literally "Three bodies or personalities"; 三身 [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''Sānshén'', [[Japanese language|Japanese]]: ''sanjin'') is an important Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and what a Buddha is. By the 4th century CE the trikaya doctrine had assumed its current form. Briefly the doctrine says that a Buddha has three ''kayas'' or ''bodies'': the ''[[nirmanakaya]]'' or ''created body'' which manifests in time and space; the ''[[sambhogakaya]]'' or ''body of mutual enjoyment'' which is an archetypal manifestation; and the ''[[Dharmakaya]]'' or ''reality body'' which embodies the very principle of enlightenment and knows no limits or boundaries.&lt;ref name="purifymind.com"&gt;Welwood, John (2000). ''The Play of the Mind: Form, Emptiness, and Beyond''. Source:  http://www.purifymind.com/PlayMind.htm (accessed:  Saturday January 13, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the view of [[Anuyoga]], the '[[Mindstream]]' (Sanskrit: ''citta santana'') is the 'continuity' (Sanskrit: ''santana''; Wylie: ''rgyud'') that links the Trikaya.&lt;ref name="purifymind.com"/&gt; The Trikaya, as a triune, is symbolised by the [[Gankyil]].

CSWRI is departmentalised into six divisions, each attending to a specific set of activities.

===Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding===
Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding was started in 1966 under the name ''Sheep Genetic Section'' with a mandate to conduct research on improvement of indigenous breeds of sheep for wool and meat. It was renamed as Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding in 1975. Animal Genetics and Breeding  Division carried out pioneer work in the field of crossbreeding for improving the production of mutton, carpet wool, apparel wool and pelt.  Various crosses like Avikalin, Bharat Merino, Avimaans, Indian Karakul, Awassi X Malpura and Avivastra were developed at this division. Research was also carried out with indigenous goats (Marwari, Sirohi and Kutchi) to evolve milk and meat producing goats. The biochemical polymorphic studies were undertaken to study the inheritance of various blood constituents and to determine the possible association of these biochemical parameters with economic traits. Cytogenetic studies were initiated in 1982. In 1997, Garole, a prolific microsheep of West Bengal was introduced for increasing prolificacy of Malpura sheep. Marker Assisted Selection (MAS) for prolificacy has been practically used in the routine breeding programme. In 2008, Patanwadi inheritance was introduced into prolificacy project to improve the milk yield and mothering ability. Three breed prolific cross was produced in 2009 and strengthening of prolific flock is in progress.  Recently study on understanding the genetic basis of immune response variability in sheep has been initiated.   Stalwarts like Dr. M V Krishna Rao, Dr. O N Singh, Dr. R M Acharya,  Dr. R Nagercenkar,  Dr. A L  Chaudhary, Dr. R N Singh,  Dr. C L Arora, Dr. S D J Bohra,  Dr. B U Khan,  Dr. V K Singh  and  Dr. A L Arora  had  shaped the development  and progress of this division. At present Dr. Arun Kumar is head of the division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cswri.res.in/divisions_animal_genetics_breeding.asp | title=Division of Animal Genetics and Breeding | publisher=ICAR - Central Sheep and Wool Research Institute | accessdate=5 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division of Animal Nutrition===
The division had its origin in 1965 under the name, the Sheep Nutrition Section and was upgraded to cover all aspects of animal nutrition including grass land and [[forage]] [[agronomy]]. The division is mandated to:
* Evaluate various types of feed resources- pasture (grasses, [[legumes]]), top feed resources, agro-industrial by-products and non-conventional feeds. 
* Determine nutritional requirements for various production functions in sheep and rabbits. 
* Develop feeding strategies for sheep, goat and rabbit production.
* Identify and reduce the adverse effect of various anti-nutritional factors in the feed.
* Improve low grade roughages.

===Division of Animal Health===
The Division of Animal Health was originally with Sheep Husbandry section but was upgraded as an independent division in 1987. The initial mandate of the division was to cover the health related aspects of the flocks under the institute. Later, the division was expanded by obtaining diagnostic laboratories and other equipment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D8930.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division of Physiology and Biochemistry===
CSWRI started a Physiology section 1965 for research on [[ovine]] physiology and reproduction with special emphasis on environmental physiology and applied reproduction. In 2003, the section was merged with Biochemistry section and the division was formed. Major projects of the division centers around [[Ram (sheep)|ram]] semen preservation, artificial insemination and adjudging the physiological adaptability of different strains developed at the institute.

===PC Cell, [[Network Project on Sheep Improvement]] (ICAR-NWPSI)===

[[Network Project on Sheep Improvement]] (NWPSI) was initiated on to undertake survey, evaluation and improvement of indigenous sheep breeds under native environment. Different breeds of sheep are being improved through selection and inter-se mating for wool and mutton production. The mandate of NWPSI is genetic evaluation and improvement of indigenous sheep by selection. Presently, there are six ongoing centres of NWPSI including four farm based units and two field based units located at difference parts of the country.
Coordination Cell:  Project Coordinator Cell, NWPSI, ICAR-CSWRI, Avikanagar

Cooperating Units:

A.  Farm based Cooperating units

1.ARC (CSWRI), Bikaner - Marwari sheep for Carpet Wool

2.CIRG, Makhdoom - Muzaffarnagri sheep for Dual purpose

3.MPKV, Rahuri - Deccani sheep for Dual purpose

4.SVVU, Palamner - Nellore sheep for Mutton

B.  Field based Cooperating units

1.TANUVAS, Kattupakkam - Madras Red sheep for Mutton

2.ARC (CSWRI), Bikaner- Magra Sheep for Carpet wool

The objectives of NWPSI is Genetic improvement of indigenous sheep breeds by selection. The technical programme aims at improvement of indigenous sheep breeds under farm conditions wherein the male lambs are first ranked using selection index. Index incorporates body weight and wool yield at six months of age. Each field-based unit has four centres including a ram-rearing centre, covering a sheep population of about 1500 sheep per centre. The superior male lambs are selected from the farmers’ flocks on the basis of GFY1 and 6-month body weigh in Magra sheep and on six-month body weight basis in Madras Red sheep. Male lambs are initially identified at 3 month of age and are finally selected after first shearing. Selected male lambs from improver flocks are supplied for breeding to base flocks.

Breeding rams of high breeding value are produced from farm based unit every year for germplasm distribution. During the XI plan period about 900 improved breeding rams/ram lambs from five Farm Based Units were sold to different farmers/ State Govt/ NGOs for breed improvement programme and about 700 breeding rams / ram lambs were distributed in three Field Based Units for improvement of farmers flock. The Sheep Improvement Programmes will continue and efforts will be made to bring overall improvement in sheep productivity through distribution of superior germplasm and adoption of improved scientific management practices.

More precisely, choreomusicology grew out of Euro-American performance traditions that considered musical composition and dance choreography as separate specialties. Not all performance genres separate music and dance into separate theoretical categories. The directionality of the relationship between sound and movement is not always fixed.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/Documents/in/Choreomusicology&lt;/ref&gt; Choreomusicologists hold that studying the variable relationships between sound and movement in diverse performance arts can provide insight into perceptual sensibilities, cultural processes, and interpersonal dynamics. Famous artists whose works exhibit rich choreomusical relationships include: [[John Cage]] and [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[George Balanchine]], and [[Louis Horst]] and [[Martha Graham]]. Interesting choreomusical relationships also exist in West Sumatran [[Tari Piring]], West Javanese [[Pencak Silat]], and Afro-Brazilian [[Capoeira]] to name but a few examples.&lt;ref&gt;http://jonathanstill.com/2012/03/02/new-choreomusicology-article/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mason | first1 = P.H. | year = 2012 | title = Music, dance and the total art work: choreomusicology in theory and practice | url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14647893.2011.651116#preview | journal = Research in Dance Education | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 5–24 | doi=10.1080/14647893.2011.651116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/17411912.2014.926632 | volume=23 | title=Tapping the Plate or Hitting the Bottle: Sound and Movement in Self-accompanied and Musician-accompanied Dance | journal=Ethnomusicology Forum | pages=208–228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arthur Coney Tunnard'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepeerage.com/p21743.htm#i217424] Arthur Christopher Tunnard, M, #217424, b. 7 July 1910&lt;/ref&gt; (1910 in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]] – 1979), later known as Christopher Tunnard, was a [[Canadians|Canadian]]-born [[landscape architect]], [[garden designer]], city-planner, and author of ''Gardens in the Modern Landscape'' (1938).

==Biography==
Christopher Tunnard was the son of Christopher Coney Tunnard (1879-1939), second son of Charles Thomas Tunnard of Frampton House, near [[Boston, Lincolnshire]] (now a Residential care home) and Madeline Kingscote (b. 7 Jul 1881, d. Jan 1977). He had one younger brother, Peter Kingscote Tunnard (b. 11 December 1919, d. 16 March 1940), died at age 20. Tunnard's uncle was John Charles Tunnard (b. 1873) whose only son was British surrealist artist [[John Tunnard]] (1900–1971). Another uncle was Thomas Monkton Tunnard (b. 1882) of [[Birtles Hall]], vicar of [[Over Alderley]], who married Grace Cook and fathered pianist Viola Mary Tunnard (1916-1974), Thomas Newburgh Tunnar (b. 1919) and gallery owner Peter Humphrey Tunnard (b. 1920).&lt;ref name="Landscape" /&gt;

Born and educated in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], where his [[Lincolnshire]]-born father had moved as a young man, in 1929 Christopher Tunnard went to England and obtained a Diploma from the [[Royal Horticultural Society]] in 1930.

From 1932-1935 he worked as a garden designer for [[Percy Cane]], an exponent of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]]. He then embarked on a European tour, becoming interested in [[avant-garde]] art and architecture. In 1936, he started his own practice for landscape architecture in London.

His noted landscape projects include his landscape architecture for [[Serge Chermayeff]]'s house [[Bentley Wood (Chermayeff)|Bentley Wood]] at [[East Hoathly with Halland|Halland]], [[Sussex]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apl.ncl.ac.uk/coursework/IThompson/modernism.htm Modernism], History of Environmental Design course notes, University of Newcastle upon Tyne, School of Architecture, Planning and Landscape&lt;/ref&gt; and for his modification of existing 18th-century gardens at the circular [[Art Deco]] [[St Ann's Court]] (a [[Grade II* listed buildings in Runnymede (district)|Grade II* Listed Building]]) in [[Chertsey]] designed by [[Raymond McGrath]], where Tunnard lived for a short time with his then partner, the stockbroker GL Schlesinger.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Going Full Circle | first = Fay | last = Sweet | newspaper = The Evening Standard | place = London | date = August 8, 2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote a series of articles for the [[Architectural Review]], later re-published as a manifesto, ''Gardens in the Modern Landscape''. In 1939, he designed the garden for the "All-Europe House" at the [[Ideal Home Show|Ideal Home Exhibition]], [[Earls Court Exhibition Centre|Earls Court]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = An All-Europe House: A Pocket Ideal Home | newspaper = The Times | place = UK | date = April 28, 1939}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year he emigrated to America, at the invitation of [[Walter Gropius]], to teach at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]]. From 1938 to 1943 Tunnard taught at Harvard. While in Massachusetts, he designed several gardens for modern houses, photos and/or drawings of which he later published in the second edition of his book in 1948. Among them were a small courtyard garden for the Koch House in Cambridge by Edward D. Stone and Carl Koch; planning with Koch the early modern residential development at Snake Hill Road in Belmont; and a garden for an expansive rural site in Lincoln with a new house by architect G. Holmes Perkins, who was on the Harvard faculty with Tunnard.

During the 1943/44 academic year, Tunnard lived in the Greenwich Village with his mother Madeline Kingscote. Madeline had moved to New York City to be near her other son, Peter Kingscote, who was with the Michael Chekhov's Theatre Studio at Ridgefield, CT, 40 miles away. Peter was an aspiring poet and short stories writer, but his career was cut short when he died just 20 years old in mid-1940.&lt;ref name="Landscape" /&gt;

Christopher Tunnard was drafted into the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] in 1943 and after the war took a job teaching city planning at [[Yale University|Yale]]. Enjoying the work, he did little further garden design, and reached the post of professor and chairman of the department of city planning. His publications in this area include articles such as ''America's super-cities''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.harpers.org/archive/1958/08/0008790 | title = America's super-cities | first = Christopher | last = Tunnard | journal = Harper's Magazine |date=August 1958}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of books on city design in the U.S. The best known may be ''Man-made America: Chaos or Control?'' (1963), by Tunnard and [[Boris Pushkarev]],&lt;ref name=yaledisc&gt;{{Citation | title = Yale disciplines three of its staff | newspaper = The Times | date = May 28, 1969}}.&lt;/ref&gt; which won the 1964 [[National Book Award]] [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science, Philosophy and Religion|in Science, Philosophy and Religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1061EFF3A5C147A93C3A81788D85F408685F9 | title = National Book Awards Are Presented to Six Authors; Prizes of $1,000 Given for the Best Works Published in '63 | first = Harold ‘Harry’ | last = Gilroy | newspaper = The New York Times | date = March 11, 1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nba1964&gt;{{Citation| url = https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1964 | title = National Book Awards – 1964 | publisher = [[National Book Foundation]] | accessdate = 2012-03-05}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 Yale disciplined him by demotion for sending out unauthorized admission letters to prospective students, following an unresolved departmental dispute.&lt;ref name="yaledisc"/&gt;

==Landscape architecture and garden design==
One of Tunnard’s main projects was Chermayeff's [[Bentley Wood (Chermayeff)|Bentley Wood]] in Halland Sussex in 1928. This project was shown in [[Architectural Review]] and his book [[Gardens in the Modern Landscape]].  In describing the gardens surrounding the building, Tunnard refers to them as to being in perfect harmony. The thinning of the trees left shaded lawn that gradually led up to the house and left room for daffodils and evergreens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Modern Architecture in the Sussex Landscape | journal = Architectural Review | volume = 85 | year = 1939 | pages = 61–78}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not a formal garden. The trees are formed in relation to the house in groups or by themselves. This is a concept that Tunnard describes as "letting space flow by breaking down division between usable areas and incidentally increasing their usability."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tunnard | first = Christopher | title = Modern Gardens for Modern Houses: Reflections on Current Trends in Landscape Design | journal = Landscape Architecture | year = 1942 | pages = 57–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another of Tunnard’s projects was at Galby Leicestershire House, in collaboration with architect Raymond McGrath. The building materials for the house were chosen to fit in with the scenery. For example, some remnants of the former great estates of Beaudesert were used to build the new building. In addition, Tunnard wanted the garden to be interpreted as a link between the house and the open landscape, than merely as a formal garden.

==Design philosophy==
Tunnard came to England in a period when garden design was strongly influenced by the work of [[Edwin Lutyens]], [[Gertrude Jekyll]] and [[Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott]]. The eclectic [[Arts and Crafts movement]] was drawing on this background to focus on garden features such as [[crazy paving]], [[pergola]]s, [[sundial]]s, sunken pools and [[statuary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = A century in a nutshell | first = Timothy ‘Tim’ | last = Richardson | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | place = London | date = November 5, 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunnard viewed this as "romantic trivialisation" of garden design and in reaction spearheaded a [[Modernism|Modernist]] approach to landscape design, which he expressed in the [[polemic]]al ''Gardens in the Modern Landscape''. His approach avoided decoration, sentimentality and classical allusion in favour of functional minimalist designs. For instance, his acclaimed landscape for Chermayeff's Bentley Wood house, itself Modernist, simply thinned the surrounding woodland and replanted areas with drifts of [[daffodil]]s. His writings influenced a further generation of designers such as [[Thomas Dolliver Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Keep it sleek: Architects and garden design rarely make good bedfellows — with the exception of a new breed of Modernists | first = Timothy ‘Tim’ | last = Richardson | newspaper = The Daily Telegraph | place = London | date = April 23, 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Gardens in the Modern Landscape''==
First published as a series of articles in [[Architectural Review]] from October 1937 to September 1938, [[Gardens in the Modern Landscape]] significantly challenged the then current views of landscape architecture.

[[Geoffrey Jellicoe]] reviewed Gardens in the Modern Landscape in the magazine Architecture Review and overall gave a great praise to Tunnard’s work.  As it debunks previous and most accepted styles of landscape architecture, Tunnard meets with new nature, and questioning and breaking apart most widely accepted conventions, such as symmetry and the containment of the garden to a picture. He described the book as "if you can take the jolts you will be pleasantly introduced to the brave new world of landscape," referring the jolts as this challenge to current conventions.&lt;ref name="Jellicoe, G. The Dynamic Garden 1939 pp. 151-152"&gt;{{Citation | last = Jellicoe | first = G | title = The Dynamic Garden: Gardens in the Modern Landscape | journal = Architectural Review | volume = 85 | year = 1939 | pages = 151–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In sum, Jellicoe reviews the new landscape that Tunnard describes as having a response from readers as either "shocked from it altogether, or carried off their feet with enthusiasm."&lt;ref name="Jellicoe, G. The Dynamic Garden 1939 pp. 151-152"/&gt; 
 
[[Garrett Eckbo]], [[Dan Kiley]] and [[James C. Rose|James Rose]], while together at the Graduate School of Design at Harvard during 1936 to 1938, cite reading Gardens in the Modern Landscape as inspiration against the strict rules of the curriculum of the GSD and a major influence for their work. Walker, Peter, and Melanie Simo.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Citation | title = Invisible Gardens: The Search for Modernism in the American Landscape | place = Cambridge | publisher = The MIT}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lawrence Halprin]] cites [[Gardens in the Modern Landscape]] as a revelation for him and his future career. From the book, the most enduring idea for Halprin being "A garden is a work of art, and it remains a vision for guidance as one tries to extend the garden’s benefits of rest, recreation, and aesethic pleasure to a wider public, in the larger landscape." Walker 150 Moreover, Halprin wanted to study under Tunnard. For his graduate studies, he went to the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design|GSD]] at Harvard and under Tunnard and other influential men, Halprin studied landscape architecture. Later, with Tunnard, Halprin produced an issue of Task magazine. Walker, Peter, and Melanie Simo.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==The functional garden==
[[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalism]] derives from a doctrine of "fit for purpose." Is the object made fit its purpose? From this arises a more simple and clear way of planning, and not embellished with materials or things not fit for the purpose. For Tunnad, the creation of modern houses lacked modern surroundings, which he wanted to create. Flowers are not created to just be created but to be enjoyed by children.  Gardens are not necessarily symmetrical because there is no need outside of simply being symmetrical. Tunnard cites the Swedish Garden Architect’s Associations’ paper as describing this new garden as

{{quote|&lt;p&gt;paths and walks are reduced to the minimum and often consist only of stepping stones between which grass or creeping plants are allowed to grow, thus conserving a homogeneity between the unites of the plan. Trees are not numerous in these gardens; most people prefer to have flowering shrubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The styles, axial and symmetrical planning, ostentatious decoration- all this rhetoric has been discarded to make way for simple statement. That which is necessary is such a planning system automatically become that which is good and the need for space filling or accentuating decoration disappears. The designer thus confines decoration to the integers of the plan, whose functions will determine their forms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The functional garden avoids the extremes both of the sentimental expressionism of the wild garden and the intellectual classicism of the "formal" garden; it embodies rather a spirit of rationalism and through an aesthetic and practical ordering of its units provides a friendly and hospitable milieu for rest and recreation. It is, in effect, the social conception of the garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Tunnard | first = Christopher | title = Gardens in the Modern Landscape | year = 1948}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Fletcher Steele]], noted landscape architect, agrees with Tunnard’s views of modern building design, but pointed out that Tunnard’s views as being another style and not a possible universal conception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Steele | first = Fletcher | title = Comment on Modern Gardens for Modern Houses: Reflections on Current Trends in Landscape Design | journal = Landscape Architecture | year = 1942 | pages = 57–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==City planning==
Tunnard’s latter years were spent away from landscape architecture. He taught at [[Yale University]] for [[city planning]], became more focused on preserving historic buildings, and wrote many books on urban planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tunnard, Christopher | title = A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture | first = James Stevens | last = Curl | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2006 | accessdate = 27 February 2009 | url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t1.e6116}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eckbo]] stated that landscape architect lost a great man when Tunnard went into city planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Eckbo | first = Garrett | title = Letter to the Editor | journal = Landscape Architecture | year = 1980 | page = 29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21520">In the [[United States]], a '''conservation easement''' (also called '''conservation covenant''', '''conservation restriction''' or '''conservation servitude''') is a power invested in a qualified [[private land]] conservation organization (often called a "[[land trust]]") or government (municipal, county, state or federal) to constrain, as to a specified land area, the exercise of rights otherwise held by a [[landowner]] so as to achieve certain conservation purposes. It is an interest in [[real property]] established by agreement between a landowner and land trust or unit of government. The conservation easement "runs with the land", meaning it is applicable to both present and future owners of the land. As with other real property interests, the grant of conservation easement is recorded in the local land records; the grant becomes a part of the [[chain of title]] for the property.

The conservation easement's purposes will vary depending on the character of the particular property, the goals of the land trust or government unit, and the needs of the landowners. For example, an easement’s purposes (often called "conservation objectives") might include any one or more of the following:
* Maintain and improve [[water quality]];
* Perpetuate and foster the growth of healthy [[forest]];
* Maintain and improve [[wildlife]] [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] and migration corridors;
* Protect scenic vistas visible from roads and other public areas; or
* Ensure that lands are managed so that they are always available for [[sustainable agriculture]] and forestry.

The conservation easement's administrative terms for advancing the conservation objectives also vary but typically forbid or substantially constrain subdivision and other [[real estate development]].

The most distinguishing feature of the conservation easement as a conservation tool is that it enables users to achieve specific conservation objectives on the land while keeping the land in the ownership and control of landowners for uses consistent with the conservation objectives.

The decision to place a conservation easement on a property is strictly a voluntary one whether the easement is sold or donated. The restrictions of the easement, once set in place, are perpetual (and potentially reduce the resale value of the associated property). Appraisals of the value of the easement, and financial arrangements between the parties (land owner and land trust), generally are kept private.

The landowner who grants a conservation easement continues to privately own and manage the land and may receive significant state and federal [[tax]] advantages for having donated and/or sold the conservation easement. In accepting the conservation easement, the easement holder has a responsibility to monitor future uses of the land to ensure compliance with the terms of the easement and to enforce the terms if a violation occurs.

Although a conservation easement prohibits certain uses by the landowner, such an easement does not make the land public. On the contrary, many conservation easements confer no use of the land either to the easement holder or to the public. Furthermore, many conservation easements reserve to the landowner specific uses which if not reserved would be prohibited. Some conservation easements confer specific uses to the easement holder or to the public. These details are spelled out in the legal document that creates the conservation easement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elcr.org/index.php Equestrian Land Conservation Resource] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615132220/http://www.elcr.org/index.php |date=2008-06-15 }} ''Guide to equestrian-friendly conservation easements'', revised edition, 175 pages&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref is complete;  no date etc. in the original --&gt;

==Income tax deductions==
Landowners in the United States who donate a "qualifying" conservation easement to a "qualified" land protection organization under the regulations set forth in 170(h) of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] may be eligible for a federal income [[tax deduction]] equal to the value of their donation. The value of the easement donation, as determined by a qualified [[appraiser]], equals the difference between the [[fair market value]] of the property before and after the easement takes effect.

To qualify for this income tax deduction, the easement must be: a) perpetual; b) held by a qualified governmental or non-profit organization; and, c) serve a valid "conservation purpose", meaning the property must have an appreciable natural, scenic, historic, scientific, recreational, or open space value. As a result of legislation signed by President [[George W. Bush]] on August 17, 2006 (H.R. 4 The Pensions Protection Act of 2006), in 2006 and 2007, conservation easement donors were able to deduct the value of their gift at the rate of 50% of their adjusted gross income (AGI) per year. Further, landowners with 50% or more of their income from agriculture were able to deduct the donation at a rate of 100% of their AGI. Any amount of the donation remaining after the first year could be carried forward for fifteen additional years (allowing a maximum of sixteen years within which the deduction may be utilized), or until the amount of the deduction has been used up, whichever comes first. With the passage of the Farm Bill in the summer of 2008 these expanded federal income tax incentives were extended such that they also apply to all conservation easements donated in 2008 and 2009 and then this provision was extended again to apply to donations in 2010 and 2011. The provision has since expired and currently for 2012, conservation easement donations may only be deducted at the rate of 30% of the donor's AGI and after the first year the donor has a five-year carryforward.

==Income tax credits (states)==
Land conservation advocates have long tried to enact additional tax incentives for landowners to donate easements, above the federal charitable deduction (and state tax deduction in states that conform to federal tax process). There has been discussion of creating a federal income tax credit for easement donors since around 1980. However, no federal tax credit has been enacted. States, however, have moved ahead to grant credits that can be used to pay state income tax to donors of qualified conservation easements. In 1983, North Carolina became the first state to establish such a program.&lt;ref&gt;North Carolina G.S.§105-151.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Philip Tabas of [[The Nature Conservancy]] promoted the state tax credit idea widely in the 1990s. In 1999, four state legislatures enacted state tax credit programs (Virginia, Delaware, Colorado, and Connecticut, in that order). South Carolina and California followed in 2000. Several other states have followed since.

For landowners with little income subject to state taxation, a tax credit is a hollow reward for reducing the value of real property by donating a conservation easement. To respond to this, Colorado conservationists made their state tax credit transferable in 2000—that is, the donor/landowner can sell her/his credit to other parties; the buyers then use the purchased tax credit to pay their Colorado income tax. This is appealing to buyers because the credit is sold at a discount from face value. Virginia followed by enacting transferability in 2002. Delegate Bill Howell (now Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates) introduced HB1322, which had been suggested to him by conservationists Charles Davenport and Phil Hocker. HB1322 was enacted, effective retroactively to January 1, 2002. Other states have followed since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Walden to Wall Street, Chapter 8|year=2005|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC, USA|isbn=1-59726-029-0|pages=124–137|authorlink=Transferable State Tax Credits as a Conservation Incentive|editor=James N. Levitt|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, "caps" on the amount of credit an easement can generate, and other restrictions, limit the scope of the different state tax credit programs in varying manners.

In the states where credit for conservation land donations is transferable, free markets have arisen. Brokers assist landowners with excess credit to contact buyers, and the brokers often handle payments and paperwork to protect the principals, and to ensure that transfers are fully reported to the state tax authorities. The federal and state tax treatment of profits from sale and use of transferable tax credit have been the subject of extensive discussion and the issuance of several guidance documents by the Internal Revenue Service.&lt;ref&gt;[A comprehensive treatment of IRS views on state income tax credit transfers is contained within IRS AM 2007-002, issued 26Jan2007.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Mexico state income tax credit was originated in 2003.[SB 581] New transferability legislation, effective January 1, 2008, applies retroactively to conservation easements effected from January 1, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmcpr.state.nm.us/NMAC/parts/title03/03.013.0020.htm 3.13.20 NMAC]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Virginia transferable credit program is the largest among the States in dollar value of property conserved. By the end of 2010, $2,512,000,000 of property value had been donated as easements in Virginia for which tax credit was claimed.&lt;ref&gt;[For a comprehensive online treatment of the Virginia credit program, see: {{cite web |url=http://www.conservationfund.org/sites/default/files/The_Conservation_Fund_Chesapeake_Bay_Better_Models_for_Conservation_Chapt4_VA_State_Tax_Credit.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724194232/http://www.conservationfund.org/sites/default/files/The_Conservation_Fund_Chesapeake_Bay_Better_Models_for_Conservation_Chapt4_VA_State_Tax_Credit.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}]&lt;/ref&gt; The qualifying easements cover over {{convert|516,000|acre|km2}} of Virginia landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[Virginia Department of Taxation, public presentations, Jan2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Virginia program now (2011) grants about $110 million of new tax credit each year. The credit allowance is 40% of the appraised value of the easement donation, so this equates to $275 million of property value donated per year for protection of wildlife habitat, farmland and woodland, and scenic open space—in perpetuity. The other state tax credit programs are smaller in dollar measurement, but are very significant in the area and the conservation values that they cause to be protected. The concept of state tax credit action (in the absence of a federal tax credit) that Philip Tabas and The Nature Conservancy promoted in the 1990s has borne remarkable fruit, and continues to expand today.

==Estate tax reductions and exclusions==
For landowners who will leave sizable estates upon their death, the most important financial impact of a conservation easement may be a significant reduction in [[estate tax]]es. Estate taxes often make it difficult for heirs to keep land intact and in the family because of high estate tax rates and high development value of land. It may be necessary to subdivide or sell land for development in order to pay these taxes which may not be the desire of the landowner or their heirs. A conservation easement can often provide significant help with this problem in three important ways:

# ''Reduction in value of the estate.'' The deceased's estate will be reduced by the value of the donated conservation easement. As a result, taxes will be lower because heirs will not be required to pay taxes on the extinguished development rights. In other words, heirs will only have to pay estate taxes on preserved farmland values, and not full development values.
#''Estate exclusion.'' Section 2031(c) of the tax code provides further estate tax incentives for properties subject to a donated conservation easement. When property has a qualified conservation easement placed upon it, up to an additional 40% of the value of land (subject to a $500,000 cap) may be excluded from the estate when the landowner dies. This exclusion is in addition to the reduction in land value attributable to the easement itself as described above.
#''After death easement.'' Heirs may also receive these benefits (but not the income tax deduction) by electing to donate a conservation easement after the landowner's death and prior to filing the estate return (called a "post mortem" election).

In Pennsylvania, conservation restrictions on land included in the estate can reduce the inheritance tax owed.&lt;ref&gt;Pregmon, Esq., Patricia. "Reducing Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax", ConservationTools.org. Online. http://conservationtools.org/guides/show/52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State and property tax incentives==
Some states ([[Colorado]], [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], and [[North Carolina]]) offer a state income tax incentive and many states offer [[property tax]] incentives to conservation easement donors. In Pennsylvania, conservation restrictions on land included in the estate can reduce the inheritance tax owed.&lt;ref&gt;Pregmon, Patricia, Esq. "Reducing Pennsylvania Inheritance Tax", ConservationTools.org. Online. http://conservationtools.org/guides/show/52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues to consider==
* As is the case with any property interest, a conservation easement may be taken by eminent domain (and thereby extinguished) when the public value of the proposed project exceeds that of the conservation interest being protected by the easement.
* Conservation easements may result in a significant reduction in the sale price of the land because a builder can no longer develop it. In fact, this difference in value is the basis for the granting of the original tax incentives. An estimate of 35%–65% value reduction has been made on conservation easement land to the land owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olmsted|first1=James|title=Conservation Easements: New Perspectives in an Evolving World|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Fall 2011|volume=74|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Clear boundaries of adjacent properties are not always consistent with each other. Currently, the NCED manages this issue by snapping boundary polygons to a standard parcel layer which may differ from the original data provided by a landowner.

==Purchase of conservation easements==
Many conservation easements are purchased with funds from federal, state, and local governments, nonprofit organizations, or private donors. In these cases, landowners are paid directly for the purchase of the conservation easement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olmsted|first1=James|title=Conservation Easements: New Perspectives in an Evolving World|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Fall 2011|volume=74|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Farm Bill]], updated every 5 or more years, provides an important source of funds for conservation easement purchase. The 2014 Farm Bill created the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program (ACEP) by consolidating the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program, the Grassland Reserve Program, and the Wetlands Reserve Program. Under ACEP, the [[Natural Resources Conservation Service]] helps tribes, state and local governments, and land trusts protect agriculture from development and other non-agricultural uses. ACEP includes Agricultural Land Easements and Wetland Reserve Easements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farm Bill|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/farmbill/|website=United Stated Department of Agriculture|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural land easements preserve land for food production and aids in soil and water conservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agricultural Conservation Easement Purchase Program|url=https://conservationtools.org/guides/47-agricultural-conservation-easement-purchase-program|website=Conservation Tools|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wetland reserve easements aim to restore wetland areas that have been converted into agricultural land. To maximize the benefits, the program targets land that has both a high chance of restoration success and a history of low crop yields or crop failure. The Farm Bill also funds the purchase of conservation easements for forestland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Farm Bill|url=https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/main/national/programs/farmbill/|website=United Stated Department of Agriculture|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Forest Legacy Program]] is a voluntary Federal program in partnership with States which protects privately owned forest lands. Landowners are required to prepare a multiple resource management plan as part of the conservation easement acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Managing the Land|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/managing-land|website=US Forest Service|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of states have direct funding sources for conservation. Commonly used funding sources include real estate transfer tax, legislative bonds, and lottery proceeds. For instance, in 2014, New Jersey added conservation funding from corporate business taxes through constitutional amendment, approved by 65% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking Investments in Protected Lands|url=http://www.conservationalmanac.org/secure/|website=Conservation Almanac|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many states and counties have programs for the purchase of agricultural conservation easements (PACE) to protect productive farmland from non-agricultural development. In 1974, [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] in New York enacted the first PACE (also known as purchase of development rights or PDR) program. King County in Washington and the states of Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut quickly followed suit. As of 2003, the PACE program operates in 23 states, including 19 statewide and more than 45 local programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/nre/in_focus/ere_if_preserve_programs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308205032/http://www.csrees.usda.gov/nea/nre/in_focus/ere_if_preserve_programs.html |archivedate=2008-03-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; King County in Washington and the states of Maryland, Massachusetts, and Connecticut quickly followed suit. As of 2016, the PACE program operates in 32 states through both state and local programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tracking Investments in Protected Lands|url=http://www.conservationalmanac.org/secure/|website=Conservation Almanac|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Conservation Easement Database maps conservation easements and provides a resource for understanding what resources conservation easements protect in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olmsted|first1=James|title=Conservation Easements: New Perspectives in an Evolving World|journal=Law and Contemporary Problems|date=Fall 2011|volume=74|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, the National Conservation Easement Database included over 130,000 conservation easements on 24.7 million acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Completeness|url=https://www.conservationeasement.us/|website=National Conservation Easement Database|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deadpan''', '''dry humor''' or '''dry wit'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rishel|first=Mary Ann|title=Writing humor|year=2002|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=0-8143-2959-4|page=166|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sBsC3ItxoYQC&amp;pg=PA166&amp;dq=%22dry+wit%22&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=y2tJT83UMIaAOoiwzewN&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22dry%20wit%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the deliberate display of a lack of or no emotion, commonly as a form of [[Comedy|comedic]] delivery to contrast with the ridiculousness of the subject matter. The delivery is meant to be blunt, [[ironic]], [[laconic]], or apparently unintentional.

==Etymology==
The term ''deadpan'' first emerged as an [[adjective]] or [[adverb]] in the 1920s, as a [[compound word]] combining "dead" and "pan" (a [[slang]] term for the face). The oldest usage recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' comes from ''[[The New York Times]]'' (1928), which defines the term as "playing a role with expressionless face".&lt;ref name="oed"&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''. [http://oed.com/view/Entry/47677 "dead-pan, adj., n., adv., and v."] Second edition, 1989; online version December 2011. accessed 17 February 2012. First published in ''A Supplement to the OED I'', 1972&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this usage is in a scene from the 1934 film ''[[The Gay Bride]]'' in which a [[gangster]] tells a man on the other end of a phone conversation to "give it a dead pan" (with the emphasis on "pan"), so that the man does not inadvertently alert anyone else in the room as to the importance of what the gangster is about to say. The usage of deadpan as a [[verb]] ("to speak, act, or utter in a deadpan manner; to maintain a dead pan") is recorded at least as far back as 1942.&lt;ref name="oed"/&gt;

==Examples==
{{see also|List of deadpan comedians}}

Early in his vaudeville days, [[Buster Keaton]] developed his deadpan expression.  Keaton realized that audiences responded better to his stony expression than when he smiled, and he carried this style into his silent film career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/deadpan-the-comedy-of-buster-keaton|title=Deadpan: the comedy of Buster Keaton|work=[[Telescope (TV series)|Telescope]]|publisher=[[CBC.ca]]|date=17 April 1964|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1980 film ''[[Airplane!]]'' was performed almost entirely in deadpan.&lt;ref name="MIL"&gt;{{cite news| last=Dudek| first=Duane| title=25 years and still laughing; Airplane!' maintains its cruising| work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493|accessdate=23 February 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430053901/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=332493 |archivedate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular American sitcoms use deadpan expressions to deliver dry humor, including ''[[Curb Your Enthusiasm]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', and ''[[My Name Is Earl]]''. More recent examples are [[Andre Braugher]] as Captain Raymond Holt from the TV show ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'', [[Jennette McCurdy]] as Sam Puckett in ''[[iCarly]]'', and [[Louis C.K.]] in ''[[Louie (U.S. TV series)|Louie]]''. Another example is the comedy of [[Steven Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Thomas | first=E.C. | title=The Everything Big Book of Jokes: Hundreds of the Shortest, Longest, Silliest, Smartest, Most Hilarious Jokes You've Never Heard! | publisher=Adams Media | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-4405-7698-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zrsDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA16 | access-date=June 29, 2017 | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dry humor is often confused with [[highbrow]] or [[egghead]] humor, because the humor in dry humor does not exist in the words or delivery. Instead, the listener must look for humor in the contradiction between words, delivery and [[Context (language use)|context]]. Failure to include the context or to identify the contradiction results in the listener finding the dry humor unfunny. However, the term "deadpan" itself actually refers only to the method of delivery.

'''Explorative strategies''' are used in drama to explore a theme or a text. They are associated with Edexcel GCSE.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Types of strategies==
*''' Forum Theatre''' - The actors either create a planned improvisation or create a piece spontaneously, as it is performed the audience can either stop the action to suggest changes or take over from the actors on stage to change the direction of the performance. Quite often this is used as an exploration tool rather than as a piece of theatre for performance. A theme or key moment/decision can be explored to its fullest.
*'''Thought Tracking''' - Whilst in role, the character speaks out to the audience about what that character is thinking, feeling, doing etc.
*'''Still Image''' - Also known as a "[[freeze frame shot|freeze frame]]" or "tableau" or "snapshot" or "qais", this is when all the characters on stage stop still. Can be used if a narrator wishes to speak to the audience whilst something is happening on stage.
*'''Hot Seating''' - A character is interrogated by the audience. Normally used as an "in class" activity, this allows the audience to find things out about a character, and requires the actor playing the character to think about what he/she is doing, feeling, etc.
*'''Cross Cutting''' - When time in a scene changes to show  what happens before or after a scene.
*'''Narrating''' - A character, normally called the "Narrator", will speak out to the audience about what is going on in the plot
*'''Marking the moment''' - Key moments in the performance are highlighted either through a freeze frame, or a change in light or some sound by using slow motion, noises etc..
*'''Role-play''' - A role-play is what you do when you're pretending to be another person and using your imagination to speak, think and even feel like that character.

'''Graduate Medical Program (GMP)''' or sometimes also known as '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Program (GEP)]]''' or '''[[Graduate Entry|Graduate Entry Medicine (GEM)]]''' are terms generally used outside of the United States to refer to medical programs usually of 4-years duration where applicants are [[university]] graduates who have taken aptitude tests such as the [[GAMSAT]], [[UKCAT]] or [[MCAT]]. These tests are not to be confused with tests such as the [[UMAT]] since tests such as the [[UMAT]] are designed for high school graduates. Medical programs in the United States technically do not require the completion of a previous degree, but do require the completion of 2–3 years of pre-medical sciences at the university level and so are thus classified as [[Second entry degree]]s. However, since in places such as [[Australia]] medical applicants were historically generally high school graduates and only recently have medical schools changed to requiring the completion of a previous [[bachelor's degree]], the terms '''Graduate Medical Program''' and '''Graduate Entry Medicine''' arose to differentiate the new courses.

==Introduction==

===Green infrastructure===
[[Nature]] can be used to provide important services for communities by protecting them against [[flooding]] or excessive heat, or helping to improve [[air pollution|air]], [[soil quality|soil]] and [[water quality]]. When nature is harnessed by people and used as an infrastructural system it is called “green infrastructure”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Benedict, Mark A. &amp; McMahon, Edward T. (2006). Green Infrastructure: linking landscapes and communities&lt;/ref&gt;  Green infrastructure occurs at all scales. It is most often associated with stormwater management systems, which are smart and cost-effective.&lt;ref name="cnt.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnt.org/repository/gi-values-guide.pdf|title=The Value of Green Infrastructure: A Guide to Recognizing Its Economic, Environmental and Social Benefits|date=21 January 2011|publisher=Center for Neighborhood Technology|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, green infrastructure is really a larger concept and is closely associated with many other things. Green infrastructure also serves to provide an ecological framework for social, economic and environmental health of the surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Sprawlwatch Clearinghouse. http://www.sprawlwatch.org/greeninfrastructure.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blue infrastructure===
{{main article|:Category:Water supply infrastructure}} "Blue infrastructure" refers to urban infrastructure relating to water. Blue infrastructure is commonly associated with green infrastructure in the urban setting and may be referred to as "blue-green" infrastructure when in combination. Rivers, streams, ponds and lakes may exist as natural features within cities, or be added to an urban environment as an aspect of its design. Urban developments on coasts may also have pre-existing features of the coastline specifically employed in their design. Harbours, quays, piers and other extensions of the urban environment may also be added to capture benefits associated with the marine environment. There may considerable co-benefits to health and wellbeing of populations with access to blue spaces in the urban context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://bluehealth2020.eu/ |title=BlueHealth |website=BlueHealth |access-date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = grellier2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Grellier|first1= James|last2= White|first2= Mathew P|last3= Albin|first3= Maria|last4= Bell|first4= Simon|last5= Elliott|first5= Lewis R|last6= Gascón|first6= Mireia|last7= Gualdi|first7= Silvio|last8= Mancini|first8= Laura|last9= Nieuwenhuijsen|first9= Mark J|last10= Sarigiannis|first10= Dennis A|last11= van den Bosch|first11= Matilda|last12= Wolf|first12= Tanja|last13= Wuijts|first13= Susanne|last14= Fleming|first14= Lora E|date= 2017|title= BlueHealth: a study programme protocol for mapping and quantifying the potential benefits to public health and well-being from Europe’s blue spaces|url= http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/6/e016188|journal= BMJ Open|volume=7 |issue=6 |pages= |doi= 10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016188|access-date= 16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
Some people might expect that green spaces are excessive to maintain and extravagant in nature, but high-performing green spaces can provide real economic, ecological and social benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unepinquiry.org/publication/sustainable-infrastructure-and-finance/|title=Sustainable Infrastructure and Finance - UNEP Inquiry|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:
* [[Urban forestry]] in an urban environment can supplement managing storm water and reduce the energy usage costs and runoff in result.&lt;ref name="cnt.org"/&gt;
* [[Bioretention]] systems can work to create a green transportation system.&lt;ref name="cnt.org"/&gt;
In result, high performing green spaces work to create a balance between built and natural environments.&lt;ref name="cnt.org"/&gt;
*Higher abundance of green space in communities or neighbourhoods is observed to have higher frequencies in participation of physical activity among elderly men.&lt;ref&gt;Gong, Y., Gallacher, J., Palmer, S. Fone, D.(2014)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24646136 Neighbourhood green space, physical function and participation in physical activities among elderly men: the Caerphilly Prospective study] ''The international journal of behavioral nutrition and physical activity'' '''11'''(1):40.&lt;/ref&gt;
* More green space around one's house is associated with better [[mental health]].&lt;ref name= BosGr&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bos, E.H.|author2=van der Meulen, L.|author3=Wichers, M.|author4=Jeronimus, B.F.| year = 2016 | title = A Primrose Path?

===Economic effects===
A study in 2012 that focused on 479 green infrastructure projects across the United States, found that 44% of green infrastructure projects reduced costs compared to the 31% that increased the costs. The most notable cost savings were due to reduced storm[[water runoff]] and decreased [[heating]] and [[cooling]] costs.&lt;ref name="citylab.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/tech/2012/04/green-infrastructure-could-cities-save-billions/1832/|title=Green Infrastructure Could Save Cities Billions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA-econ"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/economics-green-infrastructure |title=The Economics of Green Infrastructure |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-02 |publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
Ideas for green urban structures began in the 1870s, with concepts of [[urban farming]] and garden allotments.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt; Alternative terminology includes stormwater [[Best management practice for water pollution#Stormwater Management BMPs|best management practices]] (BMPs), source controls, and [[Low-impact development (U.S. and Canada)|low impact development]] (LID) practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Urban Runoff: Low Impact Development |url = http://www.epa.gov/polluted-runoff-nonpoint-source-pollution/urban-runoff-low-impact-development |publisher=EPA |date = 2016-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green infrastructure concepts originated in mid-1980s proposals for best management practices that would achieve more holistic stormwater quantity management goals for runoff volume reduction, erosion prevention, and aquifer recharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last=Schueler |first=Tom |date=1987 |title=Controlling Urban Runoff: A Practical Manual For Planning And Designing Urban BMPs |url=https://www.mwcog.org/documents/1987/07/01/controlling-urban-runoff-bmp-stormwater/ |publisher=Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments |location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, amendments to the U.S. [[Clean Water Act]] introduced new provisions for management of diffuse pollutant sources from urban land uses, establishing the regulatory need for practices that unlike conventional drainage infrastructure managed runoff "at source." Under the Act, the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) published regulations for municipalities in 1990, requiring the development of storm water pollution prevention plans and the implementation of "source control practices".&lt;ref&gt;EPA (1990-11-16). [http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-10/documents/stormwater_phase1_rule.pdf "National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permit Application Regulations for Storm Water Discharges"]. ''Federal Register,'' 44 FR 47990.&lt;/ref&gt; EPA's 1993 handbook, ''Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention and Control Planning,'' identified BMPs to consider in such plans, including vegetative controls, filtration practices and infiltration practices (trenches, porous pavement).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=September 1993 |title=Handbook: Urban Runoff Pollution Prevention and Control Planning |url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=30004LY0.txt |publisher=EPA |location=Cincinnati |id=EPA/625/R-93/004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Infrastructure is a concept that highlights the importance of the natural environment in decisions about [[land-use planning]].&lt;ref&gt;The Conservation Fund, Arlington, VA. [http://www.greeninfrastructure.net/ "Green Infrastructure."] Accessed 2009-10-06.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Department of Natural Resources, Annapolis, MD. [http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gidoc/gidoc.html ''Maryland's Green Infrastructure Assessment: A Comprehensive Strategy for Land Conservation and Restoration.''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309184735/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/greenways/gi/gidoc/gidoc.html |date=2008-03-09 }} May 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term does not have a widely recognised definition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/green-infrastructure-and-territorial-cohesion accessed: 09.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csc.noaa.gov/magazine/2009/03/article2.html accessed: 09.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as “blue-green infrastructure”&lt;ref name="Multifunctional green areas"&gt;http://www.ramboll.com/projects/viewproject?projectid=F73AC734-B657-48A0-AE92-0C8A85C8992A accessed: 10.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; or “green-blue urban grids”&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt; the terms are used by many design-, conservation- and planning related disciplines and commonly feature stormwater management, climate adaptation and multifunctional green space.

The term "green infrastructure" is sometimes expanded to "multifunctional" green infrastructure.  Multifunctionality in this context refers to the integration and interaction of different functions or activities on the same piece of land.

EPA extended the concept of “green infrastructure” to apply to the management of [[stormwater]] runoff at the local level through the use of natural systems, or engineered systems that mimic natural systems, to treat polluted [[urban runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/what-green-infrastructure |title=Basics: What is Green Infrastructure? |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-08-12 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; This use of the term "green infrastructure" to refer to urban "green" BMPs, although not central to the larger concept, does contribute to the overall health of natural ecosystems.

However, it is apparent that the term “blue-green infrastructure” is applied in an urban context and places a greater emphasis on the management of stormwater as an integral part of creating a sustainable, multifunctional urban environment.&lt;ref name="Multifunctional green areas" /&gt;
&lt;!-- Here is some background to green infrastructure and the rise of the movement. --&gt;

==The role of water: blue spaces and blue infrastructure==
Proximity and access to water have been key factors in human settlement through history.&lt;ref&gt;Solomon S. Water: the epic struggle for wealth, power, and civilization. New York: BMJ Publishing Group, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing drinking water and food, water and the spaces around it create potential for transport, trade and power generation, and provide the human population with resources in terms of recreation and tourism. Many of the world’s largest cities are located near to water sources, and networks of urban "blue infrastructure", such as canals, harbours and so forth, have been constructed to capture the benefits and minimise risks. Globally, cities are facing severe water uncertainties, such as floods, droughts and upstream activities on trans-boundary rivers. The increasing pressure, intensity and speed of urbanisation has led to the disappearance of any visible form of water infrastructure in most cities.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/2369268/Water_purificative_landscapes_constructed_ecologies_and_contemporary_urbanism  accessed: 10.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; Urban coastal populations are growing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Neumann|first1= B|last2= Vafeidis|first2= A T|last3= Zimmermann|first3= J|last4= Nicholls|first4= R J|date= |title= Future Coastal Population Growth and Exposure to Sea-Level Rise and Coastal Flooding - A Global Assessment|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118571|journal= PLoS ONE|volume= 10|issue= 3|pages= e0118571|doi= 10.1371/journal.pone.0118571|access-date= 16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many cities have seen extensive postindustrial transformation of canals, riversides, docks etc. following changes in global trading patterns. The potential implications of such waterside regeneration in terms of public health have only recently been scientifically investigated.&lt;ref name = grellier2017 /&gt; A systematic review conducted in 2017 found consistent evidence of positive associations between exposure of people to blue space and mental health and physical activity.&lt;ref name = gascon2017&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Gascón|first1= Mireia|last2= Zijlema|first2= Wilma|last3= Vert|first3= Cristina|last4= White|first4= Mathew P|last5= Nieuwenhuijsen|first5= Mark J|date= 2017|title= Outdoor blue spaces, human health and well-being: A systematic review of quantitative studies|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1438463917302699|journal= International Journal of Hygiene and Environmental Health|volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= 10.1016/j.ijheh.2017.08.004|access-date= 18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One fifth of the world’s population, 1.2 billion people, live in areas of [[water scarcity]]. Climate change and water-related disasters will place increasing demands on urban systems and will result in increased migration to urban areas. Cities require a very large input of freshwater and in turn have a huge impact on freshwater systems. Urban and industrial water use is projected to double by 2050.&lt;ref name="Waterforlife"&gt;https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/swm_cities_zaragoza_2010/pdf/02_water_uncertainties.pdf. accessed: 09.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the [[United Nations]] declared that access to clean water and sanitation is a human right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/pdf/facts_and_figures_human_right_to_water_eng.pdf |title=The Human Right to Water (poster) |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2011 |website=UN-Water Decade Programme on Advocacy and Communication |publisher=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; New solutions for improving the sustainability of cities are being explored. Good urban water management is complex and requires not only water and wastewater infrastructure, but also pollution control and flood prevention. It requires coordination across many sectors and between different local authorities and changes in governance that lead to more sustainable and equitable use of the urban water resources.&lt;ref name="Waterforlife" /&gt;

==Types of green infrastructure==
===Urban forests===
[[Urban forest]]s are forests located in cities. They are an important component of urban green infrastructure systems. Urban forests use appropriate tree and vegetation species, instead of noxious and invasive kinds, which reduce the need of maintenance and irrigation.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"&gt;{{cite web|title=Green Infrastructure: Cities |url=http://www.asla.org/ContentDetail.aspx?id=43535 |website=American Society of  Landscape Architects |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, native species also provide aesthetic value while reducing cost. Diversity of plant species should also be considered in design of urban forests to avoid [[monocultures]]; this makes the urban forests more durable and resilient to pests and other harms.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;

====Benefits====
* [[Energy use]]: According to a study conducted by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Sacramento Municipal Utility District, it was found that urban trees can provide up to 47% energy savings.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;
* [[Urban heat island]]: Maximum air temperature for tree groves were found to be lower than that of open areas without trees. This is because of a process called evaporative cooling.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;
* [[Water management]]: Urban forests helps with city water management on diverting storm water from water channels. Trees intercept a large amount of rainfall that hit them.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;
* [[Air pollution]]: Trees hold carbon, which improve air quality in cities.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt; 
* Property values: Having more trees increases property value, which suggests that people value greenery and trees wherever they are. This implies that trees contribute to the preferred living conditions of people. 
* [[Public health]]: Urban greenery can also improve mental health and well-being.&lt;ref name="GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE: CITIES"/&gt;
* Creating Urban forest affects Public Health in many ways, as mentioned above urban heat islands are created by the condensation of heat due to the materials and infrastructure used in metropolitan areas, which can negatively impact human health. Urban forests provide natural shading structures at a fraction of the cost of artificial shading structures and it counters the negative health impacts of increasing global temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Young|first=Robert|date=18 Oct 2011|title=Planting the Living City|url=&lt;dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2011.616996.&gt;|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond countering the negative impacts of man-made infrastructure, green infrastructure has the potential to enhance existing ecosystems and make them more stable, which has been historically done in traditional Japanese agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McHarg |first1=Ian L. |title=The Place of Nature in the City of Man |journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=8 September 2016 |volume=352 |issue=1 |pages=1–12 |doi=10.1177/000271626435200102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green infrastructure in an urbanized area can help restore and enhance the resiliency of an ecosystem to natural disturbances and disasters that disrupt the lives of residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Brian|date=16 Sep 2004|title="Resilience, Adaptability and Transformability in Social–ecological Systems."|url=https://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol9/iss2/art5/|journal=Ecology and Society |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Building new urban forests in an existing metropolitan area creates new labor jobs that do not require a high level of education, which can decrease unemployment in the working class which benefits society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Faulconer|first=Kevin|date=Dec 2015|title=City of San Diego Climate Action Plan|url=http://www.sandiego.gov/sustainability/.|journal=Krout Associates Sustainability Counseling|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, green infrastructure helps states to implement the principles of the 1992 Rio Declaration on Environment and Development that was designed to alleviate the social and economic consequences of environmental degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 June 1992|title=1992-Rio-Declaration-on-Environment-and-Development|url=http://www.cil.nus.edu.sg&gt;|journal=United Nations Division for Sustainable Development|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructed wetlands===
[[Constructed wetland]]s are manmade [[wetland]]s, which work as a bio-filtration system. They contain wetland vegetation and are mostly built on uplands and [[floodplain]]s.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Constructed treatment wetland|url=http://water.epa.gov/type/wetlands/restore/upload/2004_09_20_wetlands_pdf_ConstructedW.pdf|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Constructed wetlands are built this way to avoid connection or damage to natural wetlands and other aquatic resources.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt; There are two main categories of constructed wetlands: subsurface flow system and free water surface system.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt; Proper planning and operating can help avoid possible harm done to the wetlands, which are caused by alteration of natural hydrology and introduction of invasive species.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt;

====Benefits====
* [[Water efficiency]]: Constructed wetlands try to replicate natural wetland ecosystems. They are built to improve water efficiency and water quality. They also create [[wildlife habitat]]s by using natural processes of plants, soils, and associated [[microorganism]]s. In these types of wetlands, vegetation can trap parts of suspended solids and slow down water flow; the microorganisms that live there process some other pollutants.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt;
* [[Cost-effective]]: Wetlands have low operating and maintenance costs. They can also help with fluctuating water levels. Aesthetically, constructed wetlands are able to add greenery to its surrounding environment. It also helps to reduce unpleasing odors of wastewater.&lt;ref name="Constructed treatment wetland"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constructed Wetland|url=http://www.2030palette.org/swatches/view/constructed-wetland/esalen_institute_1.jpg|website=Architecture 2030|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Green roofs and green walls===
[[Green roof]]s improve air and water quality while reducing energy cost. The plants and soil provide more green space and insulation on roofs. Green and blue roofs also help reducing city runoff by retaining rainfall providing a potential solution for the stormwater management in highly concentrated urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Green roof|url=http://www.2030palette.org/swatches/view/green-roof/tu_delft_library_1.jpg|website=Architecture 2030|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shafique|first=Muhammad|last2=Kim|first2=Reeho|date=2017-06-20|title=Retrofitting the Low Impact Development Practices into Developed Urban areas Including Barriers and Potential Solution|url=https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/geo.2017.9.issue-1/geo-2017-0020/geo-2017-0020.xml?format=INT|journal=Open Geosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=240-254|doi=10.1515/geo-2017-0020|issn=2391-5447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social benefit of green roofs is the rooftop agriculture for the residents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Green Alleys ===

[[The Trust for Public Land]] is working in partnership with the City of Los Angeles' Community Redevelopment Agency, Bureau of Sanitation, the [[University of Southern California|University of Southern Californi]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;a's Center for Sustainable Cities, and [[Jefferson High School (Los Angeles)|Jefferson High School]] by converting the existing 900 miles of alleys in the city to green alleys.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/green-alleys#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Green Alleys|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept is to re-engineer existing alleyways to reflect more light to mitigate heat island effect, capture storm water, and make the space beautiful and usable by the neighboring communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The first alley, completed in 2015, saved more than 750,000 gallons in its first year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/12/science/climate-change-alley-ways-water.html|title=Los Angeles Looks for Extra Water Down Its Alleys|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Green alleys will provide open space on top of these ecological benefits, converting spaces which used to feel unsafe, or used for dumping into a playground, and walking/biking corridor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/alley-makeover-green-alleys-los-angeles|title=Making Alleys a Place for Play (Not Old Couches)|access-date=2018-08-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;



=== Green School Yards ===
[[The Trust for Public Land]] has completed 183 green school yards across the 5 boroughs in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/media-room/new-york-city-and-trust-public-land-complete-new-green-schoolyard-queens#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=New York City and The Trust for Public Land Complete New "Green" Schoolyard in Queens|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Existing asphalt school yards are converted to a more vibrant and exciting place while also incorporating infrastructure to capture and store rainwater: rain garden, rain barrel, tree groves with pervious pavers, and an artificial field with a turf base.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/green-team-grows-new-schoolyard#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Green Team Grows New Schoolyard|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The children are engaged in the design process, lending to a sense of ownership and encourages children to take better care of their school yard.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Success in New York has allowed other cities like Philadelphia and Oakland to also convert to green school yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/media-room/work-begins-implement-green-schoolyards-oakland#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Work Begins to Implement Green Schoolyards in Oakland|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tpl.org/media-room/designed-green-play-south-philly-schoolyard-wins-recognition#sm.000001tw1n9rvrfo8u6y3v8zmk5xa|title=Designed for green play, a South Philly schoolyard wins recognition|work=The Trust for Public Land|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Low Impact Development===
Low impact development (also referred to as green stormwater infrastructure) are systems and practices that use or mimic natural processes that result in the infiltration, evapotranspiration or use of stormwater in order to protect water quality and associated aquatic habitat. LID practices aim to preserve, restore and create green space using soils, vegetation, and rainwater harvest techniques. It is an approach to land development (or re-development) that works with nature to manage stormwater as close to its source as possible. &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Emvironmental Protection Agemcy. [https://www.epa.gov/nps/urban-runoff-low-impact-development”Urban Runoff: Low Impact Development.”&lt;/ref&gt; Many low impact development tools integrate vegetation or the existing soil to reduce runoff and let rainfall enter the natural water cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Philadelphia Water Department. [http://www.phillywatersheds.org/what_were_doing/green_infrastructure/tools”Green Stormwater Infrastructure Tools.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning approach==
The Green Infrastructure approach analyses the [[natural environment]] in a way that highlights its function and subsequently seeks to put in place, through [[regulation|regulatory]] or planning policy, mechanisms that safeguard critical natural areas. Where life support functions are found to be lacking, plans may propose how these can be put in place through [[landscaping|landscaped]] and/or [[Environmental engineering|engineered]] improvements.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Benedict and Edward T. McMahon (2006). [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=2xTJvYqzFNkC&amp;dq=green+infrastructure+McMahon&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3lScdISNRt&amp;sig=p7e_ZLsXRKVC77WYtzneB7JNN0A&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result ''Green Infrastructure, Linking Landscapes and Communities.''] Washington, D.C.: Island Press. {{ISBN|1-55963-558-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within an urban context, this can be applied to re-introducing natural waterways&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramboll.com/megatrend/feature-articles/in-the-cities-of-the-future-water-flows-everywhere accessed 11.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; and making a city self-sustaining particularly with regard to water, for example, to harvest water locally, recycle it, re-use it and integrate stormwater management into everyday infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;“Blue-Green Infrastructures”.  (December 13, 2012). Topos, p.18, 21,22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-functionality of this approach is key to the efficient and [[Sustainability|sustainable]] use of land, especially in a compact and bustling country such as [[England]] where pressures on land are particularly acute.  An example might be an urban edge river [[floodplain]] which provides a repository for flood waters, acts as a [[nature reserve]], provides a recreational [[Open space reserve|green space]] and could also be productively farmed (probably through grazing). There is growing evidence that the natural environment also has a positive effect on human health.&lt;ref&gt;Irvine KN, Warber SL. (2002). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12233806/ "Greening healthcare: practicing as if the natural environment really mattered."] Altern Ther Health Med. 2002 Sep-Oct;8(5):76-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], Green Infrastructure planning is increasingly recognised as a valuable approach for [[spatial planning]] and is now seen in national, [[regional planning|regional]] and [[urban planning|local planning]] and policy documents and strategies, for example in the [[Milton Keynes]] and [[South Midlands]] Growth area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naturalengland.etraderstores.com/NaturalEnglandShop/NE176|title=Environment Agency, Bristol, UK|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501004035/http://naturalengland.etraderstores.com/NaturalEnglandShop/NE176|archivedate=2011-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, guidance on green infrastructure planning was published by Natural England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/planningtransportlocalgov/greeninfrastructure/default.aspx|title=What is Green Infrastructure?|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307002614/http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/ourwork/planningtransportlocalgov/greeninfrastructure/default.aspx|archive-date=2009-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This guidance promotes the importance of green infrastructure in 'place-making', i.e. in recognizing and maintaining the character of a particular location, especially where new developments are planned.&lt;ref&gt;Natural England website 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[North West England]] the former ''[[Regional Spatial Strategy]]'' had a specific Green Infrastructure Policy (EM3 - Green Infrastructure) as well as other references to the concept in other land use development policies (e.g. DP6).&lt;ref&gt;North West Regional Assembly, Wigan, UK. [http://rpg.nwra.gov.uk/uploads/rpg_docs/rp_kMqZ_Submitted_Draft_Regional_Spati.pdf "The North West Plan: Submitted Draft Regional Spatial Strategy for the North West of England."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070612085319/http://rpg.nwra.gov.uk/uploads/rpg_docs/rp_kMqZ_Submitted_Draft_Regional_Spati.pdf |date=2007-06-12 }} January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was supported by the ''North West Green Infrastructure Guide.''&lt;ref&gt;Green Infrastructure Think Tank (GrITT), Warrington, UK. [http://www.greeninfrastructurenw.co.uk/resources/GI_Giude_Sept_07.pdf "North West Green Infrastructure Guide."] September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Green Infrastructure Think Tank (GrITT) provides the support for policy development in the region and manages the web site that acts as a repository for information on Green Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;GrITT.

The Natural Economy Northwest programme has supported a number of projects, commissioned by The Mersey Forest to develop the evidence base for green infrastructure in the region. In particular work has been undertaken to look at the economic value of green infrastructure, the linkage between grey and green infrastructure and also to identify areas where green infrastructure may play critical role in helping to overcome issues such as risks of flood or poor air quality.

In March 2011, a prototype Green Infrastructure Valuation Toolkit&lt;ref&gt;Green Infrastructure Valuation Toolkit  - www.ginw.co.uk/projects&lt;/ref&gt; was launched. The Toolkit is available under a Creative Commons licence, and provides a range of tools that provide economic valuation of green infrastructure interventions. The toolkit has been trialled in a number of areas and strategies, including the Liverpool Green Infrastructure Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Liverpool Green Infrastructure Strategy 2010. www.ginw.co.uk/liverpool&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Greater London Authority published the All London Green Grid Supplementary Planning Guidance (ALGG SPG) which proposes an integrated network of green and open spaces together with the Blue Ribbon Network of rivers and waterways. The ALGG SPG aims to promote the concept of green infrastructure, and increase its delivery by boroughs, developers, and communities, to benefit areas such as sustainable travel, flood management, healthy living and the economic and social uplift these support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london.gov.uk/priorities/planning/publications/all-london-green-grid-spg accessed 11.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Infrastructure is being promoted as an effective and efficient response to projected climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Green Infrastructure to Combat Climate Change - www.ginw.co.uk/climatechange&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
[[File:Permeable pavers alley Chicago.jpg|thumb|[[Alley]] renovated with [[permeable paving]] located in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].]]
Green infrastructure programs managed by [[EPA]] and partner organizations are intended to improve [[water quality]] generally through more extensive management of stormwater runoff. The practices are expected to reduce stress on traditional water [[drainage]] infrastructure--[[storm sewer]]s and [[combined sewer]]s—which are typically extensive networks of underground [[pipe (material)|pipes]] and/or surface water channels in U.S. cities, towns and suburban areas. Improved stormwater management is expected to reduce the frequency of [[combined sewer overflow]]s and [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s, reduce the impacts of [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]], and provide other environmental benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/benefits-green-infrastructure |title=Benefits of Green Infrastructure |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-04-19 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;American Rivers, Inc., Washington, D.C.; Center for Neighborhood Technology, Chicago, IL (2010). [http://americanrivers.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Value-of-Green-Infrastructure.pdf "The Value of Green Infrastructure."]&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of these green infrastructure programs in use is the [[National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System]] (NPDES).  It was established in 1972 to reduce stormwater runoff pollution across the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/about-npdes |title=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) |publisher=EPA |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by distributing permits to facilities (or groups of facilities) to regulate their allowable point source pollution. Under the [[Clean Water Act]], the NPDES may be managed by localities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-state-program-information |title=National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) State Program Authorization Information |publisher=EPA |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which has prompted many cities and counties to delegate [[Best Management Practices]] (BMPs) to local builders for slowing and filtering surface runoff from their projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guide to California Planning|last=Fulton|first=William|last2=Shigley|first2=Paul|publisher=Solano Press Books|year=2012|isbn=9781938166020|edition=4|location=Point Arena, CA|pages=424–425|chapter=Structure of Natural Resources Protection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though green infrastructure is yet to become a mainstream practice,&lt;ref&gt;Dhakal K.P. and Chevalier L.R. (2017). [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479717307478 "Managing urban stormwater for urban sustainability: Barriers and policy solutions for green infrastructure application."] Journal of Environmental Management. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.07.065&lt;/ref&gt; many US cities have initiated its implementation. For example, the City of [[Philadelphia]] has installed or supported a variety of retrofit projects in neighborhoods throughout the city. Installed improvements include:
* permeable pavements in parks, basketball courts and parking lots
* [[rain garden]]s and [[bioretention]] systems at schools and other public facilities
* [[constructed wetland]]s for management of stormwater runoff.
Some of these facilities reduce the volume of runoff entering the city's aging combined sewer system, and thereby reduce the extent of system overflows during rainstorms.&lt;ref&gt;Philadelphia Water Department.

Another U.S. example is the State of [[Maryland]]'s promotion of a program called GreenPrint. GreenPrint Maryland is the first web-enabled map in the nation that shows the relative ecological importance of every parcel of land in the state.

Combining color-coded maps, information layers, and [[aerial photography]] with public openness and transparency, Greenprint Maryland applies the best environmental science and [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) to the urgent work of preserving and protecting environmentally critical lands.  A valuable new tool not only for making land conservation decisions today, but for building a broader and better informed public consensus for sustainable growth and land preservation decisions into the future.

The program was established in 2001 with the objective to “preserve an extensive, intertwined network of land vital to the long-term survival of our native plants and wildlife and industries dependent on clean environment and abundant natural resources.”&lt;ref&gt;State of Maryland, 2001.

The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) is also promoting green infrastructure as a means of managing [[Flood#Urban flooding|urban flooding]] (also known as localized flooding).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1446-20490-0539/FEMA511-complete.pdf "Reducing Damage from Localized Flooding."] U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
Since 2009, two editions of the ABC (Active, Beautiful, Clean) Waters Design Guidelines have been published by the Public Utilities Board (PUB), Singapore. The latest version (2011) contains planning and design considerations for the holistic integration of drains, canals and reservoirs with the surrounding environment. PUB encourages the various stakeholders — landowners, private developers to incorporate ABC Waters design features into their developments, and the community to embrace these infrastructures for recreational &amp; educational purposes.

The main benefits outlined in the ABC Waters Concept include:

* Treating stormwater runoff closer to the source naturally, without the use of chemicals through the use of plants and soil media, so that cleaner water is discharged into waterways and eventually our reservoirs.
* Enhancing biodiversity and site aesthetics.
* Bringing people closer to water, and creating new recreational and community spaces for people to enjoy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pub.gov.sg/abcwaters/abcwatersdesignguidelines/Pages/ABCDesignGuidelines.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130908170227/http://www.pub.gov.sg/abcwaters/abcwatersdesignguidelines/Pages/ABCDesignGuidelines.aspx |archivedate=2013-09-08 |df= }} accessed 11.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other states===

A 2012 paper by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] reviewed evidence of the economic impacts of green infrastructure in fragile states.

Upfront construction costs for GI were up to 8% higher than non-green infrastructure projects. [[Climate Finance]] was not adequately captured by [[Fragile state]]s for GI investments, and governance issues may further hinder capability to take full advantage.

GI Investments needed strong government participation as well as institutional capacities and capabilities that fragile states may not possess. Potential poverty reduction includes improved agricultural yields and higher [[rural electrification]] rates, benefits that can be transmitted to other sectors of the economy not directly linked to the GI investment.

Whilst there are examples of GI investments creating new jobs in a number of sectors, it is unclear what the employment opportunities advantages are in respect to traditional infrastructure investments. The correct market conditions (i.e. labour regulations or energy demand) are also required in order to maximise employment creation opportunities.

Such factors that may not be fully exploited by [[fragile state]] governments lacking the capacity to do so. GI investments have a number of co-benefits including increased [[energy security]] and improved health outcomes, whilst a potential reduction of a country’s vulnerability to the negative effects of climate change being arguably the most important co-benefit for such investments in a fragile state context.

There is some evidence that GI options are taken into consideration during [[project appraisal]]. Engagement mostly occurs in projects specifically designed with green goals, hence there is no data showing decision making that leads to a shift towards any green alternative. Comparisons of costs, co-benefits, [[poverty reduction]] benefits or employment creation benefits between the two typologies are also not evident.&lt;ref&gt;Lemma, A. Green Infrastructure in Fragile States, October 2012, Overseas Development Institute http://partnerplatform.org/?5amvj9gc&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, an international standard for green infrastructure is developed: SuRe® – The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure is a global voluntary standard which integrates key criteria of sustainability and resilience into infrastructure development and upgrade.&lt;ref name="issuu.com"/&gt; SuRe® is developed by the Swiss [[Global Infrastructure Basel Foundation]] (GIB) and the French bank [[Natixis]] as part of a multi-stakeholder process and will be compliant with [[ISEAL]] guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gib-foundation.org/sure-standard/|title=SuRe® - The Standard for Sustainable and Resilient Infrastructure - Global Infrastructure Basel|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
GIB has also developed the SuRe® SmartScan, a simplified version of the SuRe® Standard which serves as a self-assessment tool for infrastructure project developers. It provides them with a comprehensive and time-efficient analysis of the various themes covered by the SuRe® Standard, offering a solid foundation for projects that are planning to become certified by the SuRe® Standard in the future. Upon completion of the SmartScan, project developers receive a spider diagram evaluation, which indicates their project’s performance in the different themes and benchmarks the performances with other SmartScan assessed projects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sunwindenergy.com/content/sure-global-infrastructure-standard-sustainable-future&lt;/ref&gt;

===ABC Water Design Guidelines by PUB in Singapore===

Since 2009, two editions of the ABC (Active, Beautiful, Clean) Waters Design Guidelines have been published by the Public Utilities Board (PUB), [[Singapore]].

===Stormwater Management, Surrey, British Columbia===

Farmers claimed that flooding of their farmlands was caused by suburban development upstream. The flooding was a result of funneled runoff directed into storm drains by impervious cove, which ran unmitigated and unabsorbed into their farmlands downstream. The farmers were awarded an undisclosed amount of money in the tens of millions as compensation. Low density and highly paved residential communities redirect stormwater from impervious surfaces and pipes to stream at velocities much greater than predevelopment rates. Not only are these practices environmentally damaging, they can be costly and inefficient to maintain. In response, the city of [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]] opted to employ a green infrastructure strategy and chose a 250-hectare site called East Clayton as a demonstration project. The approach reduced the stormwater flowing downstream and allows for infiltration of rainwater closer if not at its point of origin. In result, the stormwater system at East Clayton had the ability to hold one inch of rainfall per day, accounting for 90% of the annual rainfall. The incorporation of green infrastructure at Surrey, British Columbia was able to create a sustainable environment that diminishes runoff and to save around $12,000 per household.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Nya Krokslätt, Sweden===

The site of former factory “[[Nya Krokslätt]]” is situated between a mountain and a stream. Danish engineers, Ramboll, have designed a concept of slowing down and guiding storm water in the area with methods such as vegetation combined with ponds, streams and soak-away pits as well as glazed green-blue climate zones surrounding the buildings which delay and clean roof water and [[greywater]].
The design concept provides for a multifunctional, rich urban environment, which includes not only technical solutions for energy efficient buildings, but encompasses the implementation of blue-green infrastructure and [[ecosystem services]] in an urban area.&lt;ref name="Multifunctional green areas" /&gt;

===Zürich, Switzerland===

Since 1991, the city of [[Zürich]] has had a law stating all flat roofs (unless used as terraces) must be greened roofed surfaces. The main advantages as a result of this policy include increased biodiversity, rainwater storage and outflow delay, and micro-climatic compensation (temperature extremes, radiation balance, evaporation and filtration efficiency).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/ted/de/index/gsz/angebote_u_beratung/beratung/dachbegruenungen.html|title=Dachbegrünung - Stadt Zürich|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roof biotopes are stepping stones which, together with the earthbound green areas and the seeds distributed by wind and birds, make an important contribution to the urban green infrastructure.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt;

===Duisburg-Nord, Germany===

In the old industrial area of the [[Ruhr District]] in Germany, [[Duisburg]]-Nord is a landscape park which incorporates former industrial structures and natural biodiversity. The architects Latz + Partner developed the water park which now consists of the old River Emscher, subdivided into five main sections: Klarwasserkanal (Clear Water Canal), the Emschergraben (Dyke), the Emscherrinne (Channel), the Emscherschlucht (Gorge) and the Emscherbach (Stream). The open waste water canal of the “Old Emscher” river is now fed gradually by rainwater collection through a series of barrages and water shoots. This gradual supply means that, even in lengthy dry spells, water can be supplied to the Old Emscher to replenish the oxygen levels.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.landschaftspark.de/architecture-nature/water-concept accessed: 12.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; This has allowed the canalised river bed to become a valley with possibilities for nature development and recreation.
As a key part of the ecological objectives, much of the overgrown areas of the property were included in the plan as they were found to contain a wide diversity of flora and fauna, including threatened species from the red list. Another important theme in the development of the plan was to make the water system visible, in order to stimulate a relationship between visitors and the water.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt;

===New York Sun Works Center, US===

The Greenhouse Project was started in 2008 by a small group of public school parents and educators to facilitate hands-on learning, not only to teach about food and nutrition, but also to help children make educated choices regarding their impact on the environment.
The laboratory is typically built as a traditional greenhouse on school rooftops and accommodates a hydroponic urban farm and environmental science laboratory. It includes solar panels, hydroponic growing systems, a rainwater catchment system, a weather station and a vermi composting station.
Main topics of education include nutrition, water resource management, efficient land use, climate change, biodiversity, conservation, contamination, pollution, waste management, and sustainable development.

In the early 1990s, [[Hammarby Sjöstad]] had a reputation for being a run-down, polluted and unsafe industrial and residential area.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt; Now, it is a new district in Stockholm where the City has imposed tough environmental requirements on buildings, technical installations and the traffic environment.
An ‘eco-cycle’ solution named the Hammarby Model, developed by Fortum, Stockholm Water Company and the Stockholm Waste Management Administration, is an integral energy, waste and water system for both housing and offices. The goal is to create a residential environment based on sustainable resource usage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hammarbysjostad.se/ accessed: 15.04.13&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include waste heat from the treated wastewater being used for heating up the water in the district heating system, rainwater runoff is returned to the natural cycle through infiltration in [[green roof]]s and treatment pools, sludge from the local wastewater treatment is recycled as fertiliser for farming and forestry.&lt;ref name="Urban green-blue grids" /&gt;
This sustainable model has been a source of inspiration to many urban development projects including the Toronto (Canada) Waterfront, London's New Wembley, and a number of cities/city areas in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleanenergyawards.com/no_cache/top-navigation/nominees-projects/nominee-detail/singleprintview/project/66/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618224758/http://www.cleanenergyawards.com/no_cache/top-navigation/nominees-projects/nominee-detail/singleprintview/project/66/ |archivedate=2012-06-18 |df= }} accessed: 15.04.13&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emeryville, California, US===
EPA supported the city of [[Emeryville, California]] in the development of "Stormwater Guidelines for Green, Dense Redevelopment."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/smartgrowth/emeryville.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Emeryville, which is a suburb of [[San Francisco]], began in the 1990s reclaiming, remediating and redeveloping the many brownfields within its borders. These efforts sparked a successful economic rebound. The city did not stop there, and decided in the 2000s to harness the redevelopment progress for even better environmental outcomes, in particular that related to stormwater runoff, by requiring in 2005 the use of on-site GI practices in all new private development projects. The city faced several challenges, including a high water table, tidal flows, clay soils, contaminated soil and water, and few absorbent natural areas among the primarily impervious, paved parcels of existing and redeveloped industrial sites. The guidelines, and an accompanying spreadsheet model, were developed to make as much use of redevelopment sites as possible for handling stormwater. The main strategies fell into several categories:
* Reducing the need, space and stormwater impact of motor vehicle parking by way of increased densities, height limits and floor area ratios; shared, stacked, indoor and unbundled automobile parking; making the best use of on-street parking and pricing strategies; car-sharing; free citywide mass transit; requiring one secure indoor bicycle parking space per bedroom and better bicycle and pedestrian roadway infrastructure.
* Sustainable landscape design features, such as tree preservation and minimum rootable soil volumes for new tree planting, use of structural soils, suspended paving systems, bioretention and biofiltration strategies and requiring the use of the holistic practices of Bay-Friendly Landscaping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bayfriendlycoalition.org|title=ReScape - Rethinking California Landscapes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Water storage and harvesting through cisterns and rooftop containers.
* Other strategies to handle or infiltrate water on development and redevelopment sites.

===Gowanus Canal Sponge Park, New York, US===
The [[Gowanus Canal]], in [[Brooklyn, New York]], is bounded by several communities including Park Slope, Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens, and Red Hook. The canal empties into [[New York Harbor]]. Completed in 1869, the canal was once a major transportation route for the then separate cities of Brooklyn and New York City. Manufactured gas plants, mills, tanneries, and chemical plants are among the many facilities that operated along the canal. As a result of years of discharges, storm water runoff, sewer outflows, and industrial pollutants, the canal has become one of the nation's most extensively contaminated water bodies. Contaminants include PCBs, coal tar wastes, heavy metals, and volatile organics. On March 2, 2010, EPA added the canal to the its Superfund [[National Priorities List]] (NPL). Placing the canal on the list allows the agency to further investigate contamination at the site and develop an approach to address the contamination.

After the NPL designation, several firms tried to redesign the area surrounding the canal to meet EPA's principles. One of the proposals was the Gowanus Canal Sponge Park, suggested by DLANDstudio, an architecture and landscape architecture firm based in Brooklyn. The firm designed a public open space system that slows, absorbs, and filters surface water runoff with the goal of remediating contaminated water, activating the private canal waterfront, and revitalizing the neighborhood. The unique feature of the park is its character as a working landscape that means the ability to improve the environment of the canal over time while simultaneously supporting public engagement with the canal ecosystem. The park was cited in a professional award by the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], in the Analysis and Planning category, in 2010.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

=== Lafitte Greenway, New Orleans, Louisiana, US ===
The [[Lafitte Greenway]] in [[New Orleans|New Orleans, Louisiana]], is a post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] revitalization effort that utilizes green infrastructure to improve water quality as well as support wildlife habitat.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asla.org/2013awards/328.html|title=2013 ASLA Professional Awards|last=|first=|date=|website=ASLA.com|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was previously an industrial corridor that connected the [[French Quarter]] to [[Bayou St. John, New Orleans|Bayou St. John]] and [[Lake Pontchartrain]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Part of the revitalization plan was to incorporate green infrastructure for environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; One strategy to mitigate localized flooding was to create recreation fields that are carved out to hold water during times of heavy rains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Another strategy was to restore the native ecology of the corridor, giving special attention to the ecotones that bisect the site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The design proposed retrofitting historic buildings with stormwater management techniques, such as rainwater collection systems, which allows historic buildings to be preserved.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This project received the Award of Excellence from the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]] in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Geographic Information System applications==
A [[Geographic Information System]] (GIS) is a computer system for that allows users to capture, store, display, and analyze all kinds of spatial data on Earth.&lt;ref name="education.nationalgeographic.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=GIS (geographic information system)|url=http://education.nationalgeographic.com/education/encyclopedia/geographic-information-system-gis/?ar_a=1|website=National Geographic|accessdate=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIS can gather multiple layers of information on one single map regarding streets, buildings, soil types, vegetation, and more.&lt;ref name="education.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt; Planners can combine or calculate useful information such as impervious area percentage or vegetation coverage status of a specific region to design or analyze the use of green infrastructure. The continued development of [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS) and their increasing level of use is particularly important in the development of Green Infrastructure plans. The plans frequently are based on GIS analysis of many layers of geographic information.&lt;ref name="education.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

===Green Infrastructure Master Plan===
According to the Green Infrastructure Master Plan, developed by Hawkins Partners, civil engineers use GIS to analyze the modeling of impervious surfaces with historical Nashville rainfall data within the CSS (combined sewer system) to find the current rates of runoff.
GIS  are able to help planning teams analyze potential volume reductions at the specific region for green infrastructures, including water harvesting, green roofs, urban trees, and structural control measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASLA 2013 Professional Awards, Green Infrastructure Master Plan|url=http://www.asla.org/2013awards/410.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

===Barriers===
Lack of funding is consistently cited as a barrier to the implementation of green infrastructure.  One advantage that green infrastructure projects offer, however, is that they generate so many benefits that they can compete for a variety of diverse funding sources. Some tax incentive programs administered by federal agencies can be used to attract financing to green infrastructure projects. Here are two examples of programs whose missions are broad enough to support green infrastructure projects:

* The [[U.S. Department of Energy]] administers a range of energy efficiency tax incentives, and green infrastructure could be integrated into project design to claim the incentive. An example of how this might work is found in Oregon’s Energy Efficiency Construction Credits. In Eugene, Oregon, a new biofuel station built on an abandoned gas station site included a green roof, bioswales and rain gardens. In this case, nearly $250,000 worth of tax credits reduced income and sales tax for the private company that built and operated the project.
* The [[U.S. Department of Treasury]] administers the multibillion-dollar New Markets Tax Credit program, which encourages private investment for a range of project types (typically real estate or business development projects) in distressed areas. Awards are allocated to non-profit and private entities based on their proposals for distributing these tax benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/funding-opportunities |title=Funding Opportunities |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015-11-02 |website=Green Infrastructure |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits===
[[File:Emeryville California Stormwater Curb Extension.jpg|thumbnail|right|This Stormwater Curb Extension in Emeryville, California provides a pedestrian safety element as well as stormwater quality benefits. It uses Bay-Friendly Landscaping and recycled water for irrigation.]]
Some people might expect that green spaces are excessive to maintain and extravagant in nature, but high-performing green spaces can provide real economic, ecological and social benefits. For example:
* Urban forestry in an urban environment can supplement managing storm water and reduce the energy usage costs and runoff in result. 
* Bio-retention systems can work to create a green transportation system.
* Stormwater Curb Extensions can increase pedestrian safety by increasing visibility and reducing crossing distances at intersections.
In result, high performing green spaces work to create a balance between built and natural environments.

===Economic effects===
A study in 2012 that focused on 479 green infrastructure projects across the United States, found that 44% of green infrastructure projects reduce costs compared to the 31% that increased the costs.  The most notable cost savings were due to reduced stormwater runoff and decreased heating and cooling costs.

A comprehensive green infrastructure in Philadelphia is planned to cost just $1.2 billion over the next 25 years, compared to over $6 billion for "grey" infrastructure (concrete tunnels created to move water). Under the new green infrastructure plan it is expected that:
*250 people will be employed annually in green jobs.  
*Up to 1.5 billion pounds of carbon dioxide emission to be avoided or absorbed through green infrastructure each year (the equivalent of removing close to 3,400 vehicles from roadways) 
*Air quality will improve due to all the new trees, green roofs, and parks
*Communities will benefit on the social and health side 
*About 20 deaths due to asthma will be avoided
*250 fewer work or school days will be missed
*Deaths due to excessive urban heat could also be cut by 250 over 20 years.
*The new greenery will increase property values by $390 million over 45 years, also boosting the property taxes the city takes in.

A green infrastructure plan in New York City is expected to cost $1.5 billion less than a comparable grey infrastructure approach. Also, the green stormwater management systems alone will save $1 billion, at a cost of about $0.15 less per gallon. The sustainability benefits in New York City range from $139–418 million over the 20 year life of the project. This green plan estimates that “every fully vegetated acre of green infrastructure would provide total annual benefits of $8.522 in reduced energy demand, $166 in reduced CO2 emissions, $1,044 in improved air quality, and $4,725 in increased property value.”&lt;ref name="citylab.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EPA-econ"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asla.org/ContentDetail.aspx?id=43535 |title=Green Infrastructure: Cities |publisher=American Society of Landscape Architects}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.epa.gov/green-infrastructure/green-infrastructure-cost-benefit-resources |title=Green Infrastructure Cost-Benefit Resources |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2016-08-12 |publisher=EPA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing Initiatives===
One program that has integrated green infrastructure into construction projects worldwide is the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) certification.  This system offers a benchmark rating for [[green buildings]] and neighborhoods, credibly quantifying a project’s environmental responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://new.usgbc.org/leed |title=LEED Certification |publisher=U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LEED program incentivizes development that uses resources efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/credits/new-construction/v4/material-%26-resources |title=LEED Credits: Material &amp; resources  |publisher=U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, it offers specific credits for reducing indoor and outdoor water use, optimizing energy performance, producing renewable energy, and minimizing or recycling project waste.  Two LEED initiatives that directly promote the use of green infrastructure include the rainwater management and heat island reduction credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/credits/new-construction/v4/sustainable-sites |title=LEED Credits: Sustainable sites |publisher=U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a successfully LEED-certified neighborhood development is the 9th and Berks Street [[transit-oriented development]] (TOD) in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia, PA]] which achieved a [[LEED Platinum|Platinum]] level rating on October 12, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/projects/9th-and-berks-street-tod-2?view=overview |title=9th and Berks Street TOD |publisher=U.S. Green Building Council |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach to implementing green infrastructure has been developed by the [https://living-future.org/ International Living Future Institute].  Their [https://living-future.org/lcc/ Living Community Challenge] assesses a community or city in twenty different aspects of sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://living-future.org/product/living-community-challenge-1-2-standard/|title=Living Community Challenge 1.2 Standard|last=|first=|date=|work=The Living Future Institute|access-date=29 November 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notably, the Challenge considers whether the development achieves net positive water&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://living-future.org/lcc/water-petal/ |title=Living Community Challenge: Water Petal Intent |publisher=International Living Future Institute |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and energy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://living-future.org/lcc/energy-petal/ |title=Living Community Challenge: Energy Petal Intent |publisher=International Living Future Institute |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; uses and utilizes replenishable materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://living-future.org/lcc/materials-petal/ |title=Living Community Challenge: Materials Petal Intent |publisher=International Living Future Institute |accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Hazelwood House first appears on maps in 1890. 

The house was designed by James Milne Monro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottisharchitects.org.uk/architect_full.php?id=200122|title=Dictionary of Scottish Architects - DSA Architect Biography Report (September 10, 2018, 1:31 pm)|last=Goold|first=David|website=www.scottisharchitects.org.uk|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later improved by Robert Cumming in 1913. 

It is known as the main building in the four street area known as "Glasgow's Electric Suburb"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/15363632.Residents_living_in_Glasgow_s__lost_village__express_fury_at_council_who__haven_t_kept_their_promises_/|title=Residents living in Glasgow's 'lost village' express fury at council who 'haven't kept their promises'|website=Evening Times|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the houses were the first in Glasgow to be built with internal electrical wiring – including electric lights and electric cookers.

In the late 20th century it was used as a nursing home, before it was purchased in 2003 for religious activities and retreats.

Hazelwood House is within the Hazelwood Conservation Area, created on 8 March 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=8692|title=Hazelwood Conservation Area Appraisal Executive Summary|language=en|website=www.glasgow.gov.uk|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house serves as a religious retreat and conference centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hazelwoodhouse.org.uk/|title=Hazelwood House {{!}} Conference Centre in Glasgow|website=Hazelwood House {{!}} Conference Centre in Glasgow|language=es|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosts annual public events such as Christmas carol concerts and family days.

== Architecture and features ==
Its notable architectural features include symmetrical front bay windows, a Tudor arch over the front door and a slate roof.

A lodge is adjacent. 

Substantial private gardens host a brick-walled, earthenware coping and mature trees.

== Access ==
The public can access the house on walking tours that take place during Doors Open Days each September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.festivalofarchitecture.scot/|title=Festival of Architecture 2018|website=www.festivalofarchitecture.scot|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11851">'''Heterotopia''' is a concept elaborated by philosopher [[Michel Foucault]] to describe certain cultural, institutional and discursive spaces that are somehow ‘other’:  disturbing, intense, incompatible, contradictory or transforming. Heterotopias are worlds within worlds, mirroring and yet upsetting what is outside. Foucault provides examples: ships, cemeteries, brothels, prisons, gardens of antiquity, fairs, Turkish baths and many more. Foucault outlines the notion of heterotopia on three occasions between 1966-67. A [https://foucault.info/documents/heterotopia/foucault.heteroTopia.en/ talk] given to a group of architects is the most well-known explanation of the term.  His first mention of the concept is in his ''preface'' to 'The Order of Things' and refers to texts rather than socio-cultural spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=1971 |title=The Order of Things |location=New York |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-75335-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Heterotopia follows the template established by the notions of [[utopia]] and [[dystopia]]. The prefix hetero- is from Ancient Greek ἕτερος (héteros, "other, another, different") and is combined with the Greek morpheme τόπος ("place") and means "other place".  A utopia is an idea or an image that is not real but represents a perfected version of society, such as [[Utopia (book)|Thomas More's book]] or [[Le Corbusier]]'s drawings. As Walter Russell Mead has written, "Utopia is a place where everything is good; dystopia is a place where everything is bad; heterotopia is where things are different — that is, a collection whose members have few or no intelligible connections with one another."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mead |first=Walter Russell |date=Winter 1995–1996 |title=Trains, Planes, and Automobiles: The End of the Postmodern Moment |url= |journal=World Policy Journal |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=13–31 |jstor=40209444}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterotopia in Foucault==
Foucault uses the term "heterotopia" ({{lang-fr|hétérotopie}}) to describe spaces that have more layers of meaning or relationships to other places than immediately meet the eye. In general, a heterotopia is a physical representation or approximation of a utopia, or a parallel space (such as a prison) that contains undesirable bodies to make a real utopian space impossible.

Foucault explains the link between utopias and heterotopias using the metaphor of a mirror. A mirror is a utopia because the image reflected is a 'placeless place', an unreal virtual place that allows one to see one's own visibility. However, the mirror is also a heterotopia, in that it is a real object. The heterotopia of the mirror 
is at once absolutely real, relating with the real space surrounding it, and absolutely unreal, creating a virtual image. 

Foucault articulates several possible types of heterotopia or spaces that exhibit dual meanings: 
* A ‘crisis heterotopia’ is a separate space like a boarding school or a motel room where activities like coming of age or a honeymoon take place out of sight. Foucault describes the crisis heterotopia as "reserved for individuals who are, in relation to society and to the human environment in which they live, in a state of crisis." He also points that crisis heterotopias are constantly disappearing from society and being replaced by the following heterotopia of deviation. 
* ‘Heterotopias of deviation’ are institutions where we place individuals whose behavior is outside the norm (hospitals, asylums, prisons, rest homes, cemetery).  
* Heterotopia can be a single real place that juxtaposes several spaces.  A garden can be a heterotopia, if it is a real space meant to be a microcosm of different environments, with plants from around the world. 
* 'Heterotopias of time' such as museums enclose in one place objects from all times and styles.  They exist in time but also exist outside of time because they are built and preserved to be physically insusceptible to time’s ravages. 
* 'Heterotopias of ritual or purification' are spaces that are isolated and penetrable yet not freely accessible like a public place. Either entry to the heterotopia is compulsory like in entering a prison, or entry requires special rituals or gestures, like in a [[sauna]] or a [[Turkish bath|hammam]].
* Heterotopia has a function in relation to all of the remaining spaces. The two functions are: heterotopia of illusion creates a space of illusion that exposes every real space, and the heterotopia of compensation is to create a real space—a space that is other.

Foucault's elaborations on heterotopias were published in an article entitled ''Des espaces autres'' (Of Other Spaces). The philosopher calls for a society with many heterotopias, not only as a space with several places of/for the affirmation of difference, but also as a means of escape from authoritarianism and repression, stating metaphorically that if we take the ship as the utmost heterotopia, a society without ships is inherently a repressive one, in a clear reference to [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |date=October 1984 |title=Des Espace Autres |journal=Architecture, Mouvement, Continuité |volume=5 |pages=46–49}}; it has been translated into English twice, first as {{cite journal |last=Foucault |first=Michel |others=trans.

==Heterotopia in the work of other authors==
Human geographers often connected to the [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] school have been using the term (and the author's propositions) to help understand the contemporary emergence of (cultural, social, political, economic) difference and identity as a central issue in larger multicultural cities. The idea of ''place'' (more often related to ethnicity and gender and less often to the social class issue) as a heterotopic entity has been gaining attention in the current context of postmodern, post-structuralist theoretical discussion (and political practice) in Geography and other spatial social sciences. The concept of a heterotopia has also been discussed in relation to the space in which learning takes place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blair |first=Erik |date=2009 |title=A Further Education College as a Heterotopia |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13596740902717465 |journal=Research in Post-Compulsory Education |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=93–101 |doi=10.1080/13596740902717465}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an extensive debate with theorists, such as [[David Harvey]], that remain focused on the matter of class domination as the central determinant of social heteronomy.

The geographer [[Edward Soja]] has worked with this concept in dialogue with the works of [[Henri Lefebvre]] concerning urban space in the book ''Thirdspace''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Soja |first=Edward |date=1996 |title=Thirdspace: Journeys to Los Angeles and Other Real-and-Imagined Places |location=Malden, Mass. |publisher=Blackwell Publishers |isbn=1-55786-675-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Franklin-Brown uses the concept of heterotopia in an epistemological context to examine the thirteenth century [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] of [[Vincent of Beauvais]] and [[Ramon Llull]]  as conceptual spaces where many possible ways of knowing are brought together without attempting to reconcile them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Franklin-Brown |first=Mary |date=2012 |title=Reading the World: Encyclopedic Writing in the Scholastic Age |location=Chicago, Ill. |publisher=University Of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-26068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Media scholar Hye Jean Chung applies the concept of heterotopia to describe the multiple superimposed layers of spaciality and temporality observed in highly digitized audiovisual media. A heterotopic perception of digital media is, according to Chung, to grasp the globally dispersed labor structure of multinational capitalism that produces the audiovisual representations of various spacio-temporalities. &lt;ref&gt;Chung, Hye Jean. ''Media Heterotopias: Digital Effects and Material Labor in Global Film Production'', Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 2018, pp.17-37 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Heterotopia in literature==
The concept of heterotopia has had a significant impact on literature, especially science fiction, fantasy and other [[Speculative fiction|speculative genres]]. Many readers consider the worlds of [[China Miéville]] and other [[weird fiction]] writers to be heterotopias insofar as they are worlds of radical difference transparent or of indifference to their inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gordon |first=Joan |date=November 2003 |title=Hybridity, Heterotopia, and Mateship in China Miéville's ''Perdido Street Station'' |journal=Science Fiction Studies |publisher=SF-TH Inc., DePauw University |volume=30 |issue=3 |pages=456–476 |jstor=4241204}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel R. Delany|Samuel Delany's]] 1976 novel ''[[Triton (novel)|Trouble on Triton]]'' is subtitled ''An Ambiguous Heterotopia'' and was written partly in dialogue with [[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula K. Le Guin's]] science fiction novel ''[[The Dispossessed]]'', which is subtitled ''An Ambiguous Utopia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Delany |first=Samuel R. |date=November 1990 |title=On ''Triton'' and Other Matters: An Interview with Samuel R. Delany |url=http://www.depauw.edu/sfs/interviews/delany52interview.htm |journal=Science Fiction Studies |publisher=SF-TH Inc., DePauw University |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=295–324 |jstor=4240009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chan |first=Edward K. |date=Summer 2001 |title=(Vulgar) Identity Politics in Outer Space: Delany's ''Triton'' and the Heterotopian Narrative |journal=Journal of Narrative Theory |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=180–213 |jstor=30225762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incest between twins''' or '''twincest'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wagner|first1=Roy|title=An Anthropology of the Subject: Holographic Worldview in New Guinea and its meaning and significance for the world of anthropology|date=2001|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a subclass of [[sibling incest]] and includes both [[heterosexual]] and [[homosexuality|homosexual]] relationships. While in modern Western European culture such behaviour is considered [[incest taboo|taboo]], incest between twins is a common feature in [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Asia]]n (such as Japan) and [[Oceania]]n [[mythology]], and there are a few societies in which the prohibition on it is limited or it is partially accepted.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

== In Asian culture ==
In traditional [[Bali]]nese culture, it was{{when|date=December 2013}} common for a set of [[twin]]s of the opposite sex to marry each other, since it was assumed that they had had sex in utero. The standard anthropological explanation of this custom is based in explications of the conflicts between [[Cultural heritage|descent]] and affinity in Balinese society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=113|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twin incest was a common feature of Balinese mythology. As in many other mythologies, the Balinese [[deities]] frequently marry their siblings without any of the incest-related issues faced by similarly-situated human couples.

This was commonplace in [[Southeast Asia]]n [[creation myth]]s which prominently featured twin or sibling couples. In these stories, the brother usually wooed and wed his sister, who bore his child(ren), but on discovering that they are siblings, they are often (but not always) forced to part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Errington, Atkinson |first=Shelley, Jane Monnig|title=Power and Difference: Gender in Island Southeast Asia|year=1990|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-1781-8|pages=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgWrAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA227&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] mythology, Malakás ("strong") and Magandá ("beautiful"), the first humans on earth, were fraternal twins born of the same bamboo stalk.

An old Japanese myth says that if two [[star-crossed lovers]] commit [[Suicide pact|dual suicide]], they are [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] as fraternal twins.

== In European culture ==
Twin incest is a prominent feature in ancient Germanic mythology, and its modern manifestations, such as the relationship between Siegmund and Sieglinde in [[Richard Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and a feature in some [[Greek mythology]], such as the story of [[Byblis]] and [[Kaunos (mythology)|Kaunos]]. There are strong parallels between the Germanic portrayals of twin incest and those of the Balinese [[Ramayana]], and some scholars have speculated an early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boon|first=James A.|title=Affinities and Extremes: Crisscrossing the Bittersweet Ethnology of East Indies History, Hindu-Balinese Culture and Indo-European Culture|year=1990|publisher=Chicago University Press|isbn=978-0-226-06463-5|pages=107|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEp1lzmyceYC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=incest%20twin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theme also appears in [[English literature]], such as the incest between the twins Polydore and Urania in [[Delarivier Manley]]'s ''The New Atlantis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pollak|first=Ellen|title=Incest and the English Novel, 1684-1814|year=2003|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=978-0-8018-7204-4|pages=103|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=heN14DHX_IIC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22incest%22+%22twins%22&amp;q=%22incest%22%20%22twins%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1983 review of the scholarly literature on twin homosexuality and twin incest, Ray Bixler concluded that "most same-sex homosexual twins, if reared with their co-twins, do not attempt or even want to seduce them in adulthood".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bixler |first=Ray H. |date=August 1983 |title=Homosexual Twin Incest Avoidance |journal=The Journal of Sex Research |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=296–302 |doi=10.1080/00224498309551190  |jstor=3812342}}&lt;/ref&gt; His study drew on [[Edvard Westermarck]]'s [[Westermarck effect|hypothesis]] that sexual desire is generally absent in relationships between members of a [[nuclear family]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edvard Westermarck|Westermarck, Edvard]] (1922). ''The History of Human Marriage'', Vol. II. New York: Allerton, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

One case of incest between twins, in which twins who were adopted by separate families as babies later married without knowing they were brother and sister, was mentioned in a [[House of Lords]] debate on the Human Fertility and Embryology Bill in January 2008. According to the charity Adults Affected by Adoption, there had been other cases of this sort that had involved siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Parted-at-birth twins 'married' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7182817.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=2008-01-11 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story was widely publicised in the British press,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/shock-for-the-married-couple-who-discovered-they-are-twins-separated-at-birth-6682411.html|title=Shock for the married couple who discovered they are twins separated|last=|first=|date=2008-01-11|website=|publisher=The Evening Standard|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; although its truthfulness was called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jon |last=Henley |title=Did a pair of twins really get married by mistake? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2008/jan/15/familyandrelationships.jonhenley |work=[[guardian.co.uk]] |date=2008-01-15 |accessdate=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Czech identical twins Michal and Radek Cuma are male pornographic actors who in 2009 began having sex together in video performances as "Milo and Elijah Peters". They consider themselves both brothers and romantic partners, and report that, outside their video performances with other actors, they have sex solely with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Thomas|last=Rogers|title=Gay Porn's Most Shocking Taboo|url=http://www.salon.com/2010/05/21/twincest/|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=May 21, 2010|accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and mission ==
[[File:Yale Law School in the Sterling Law Building.jpg|thumb|Yale Law School in the Sterling Law Building]]
The ISP was founded by Yale Law Professor [[Jack Balkin]] in 1997 and celebrated its 15th year in 2012. It now hosts a number of initiatives, including the Abrams Institute for Freedom of Expression, the Knight Law and Media Program, and the Thomson Reuters Initiative on Law and Technology. The center is housed on the fourth floor of 40 Ashmun Street in New Haven.

ISP fellows from around the globe come to pursue research and produce scholarship, in the form of books, articles in academic journals and popular publications, blog posts, and policy documents. Yale ISP faculty and fellows have also conducted major public policy reviews of current issues in technology and law, and written amicus briefs for cases appearing before the Supreme Court and US Courts of Appeal.

==Projects and initiatives==

===Access to Knowledge===

For several years, the ISP has collaborated on A2K projects with partner institutions in Egypt, Brazil, and other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://isp.yale.edu/access-knowledge/ Access to Knowledge]&lt;/ref&gt; This work has involved several workshops and conferences organized by ISP fellows, and culminated in a series of books, including ''Access to Knowledge in India: New Research on Intellectual Property''&lt;ref name="A2K in India"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R_-0-KVs5C0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Access+to+Knowledge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wsQgVM6-NMGUgwSd-oHgAQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Access%20to%20Knowledge%22&amp;f=false], Access to Knowledge in India: New Research on Intellectual Property, London: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Ramesh Subramarian]] and [[Lea Shaver]], and ''Access to Knowledge in Brazil: New Research on Intellectual Property''&lt;ref name="A2K in Brazil"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=fEP2smsHVCwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Access+to+Knowledge%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wsQgVM6-NMGUgwSd-oHgAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Access%20to%20Knowledge%22&amp;f=false], Access to Knowledge in Brazil: New Research on Intellectual Property, London: Bloomsbury Press.&lt;/ref&gt; edited by [[Lea Shaver]].

In [[psychology]], '''''jamais vu''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʒ|æ|m|eɪ|_|ˈ|v|uː}}; {{IPA-fr|ʒa.mɛ.vy}}), a [[French language|French]] borrowing meaning "never seen", refers to the [[phenomenon]] of experiencing a situation that one recognizes in some fashion, but nonetheless seems very unfamiliar.

==Overview==
Often described as the opposite of ''[[déjà vu]]'', ''jamais vu'' involves a sense of eeriness and the observer's impression of seeing the situation for the first time, despite rationally knowing that he or she has been in the situation before. ''Jamais vu'' is sometimes associated with certain types of [[aphasia]], [[amnesia]], and [[epilepsy]].

''Jamais vu'' is most commonly experienced when a person momentarily does not recognise a word or, less commonly, a person or place, that he or she knows.&lt;ref name="study" /&gt; This can be achieved by anyone by repeatedly writing [[Semantic satiation|or saying a specific word out loud]]. After a few seconds one will often, despite knowing that it is a real word, feel as if "there's no way it is an actual word".

The phenomenon is often grouped with ''[[déjà vu]]'' and [[tip of the tongue|''presque vu'', or ''tip of the tongue'']].

Theoretically, as seen below, a ''jamais vu'' feeling in a sufferer of a [[delirium|delirious]] disorder or intoxication could result in a delirious explanation of it, such as in [[Capgras delusion]], in which the patient takes a person known by him or her for a false [[Look-alike|double]] or impostor. If the impostor is the sufferer himself, the clinical setting would be the same as the one described as [[depersonalisation]]; hence, ''jamais vus'' of oneself, or of the very "reality of reality", are termed [[depersonalization]] and [[derealization]], respectively.

===Experiment===
A study by [[Chris Moulin]] of Leeds University asked 92 volunteers to write out "door" 30 times in 60 seconds. In July 2006 at the 4th International Conference on Memory in Sydney he reported that 68 percent of volunteers showed symptoms of ''jamais vu'', such as beginning to doubt that "door" was a real word. Dr Moulin believes that a similar brain fatigue underlies a phenomenon observed in some schizophrenia patients: that a familiar person has been replaced by an impostor. Dr Moulin suggests they could be suffering from chronic ''jamais vu''.&lt;ref name ="study" /&gt;

==Causes==

*''[[Déjà vu]]'': having the strong sensation that an event or experience currently being experienced, has already been experienced in the past, whether it has actually happened or not. In French, this literally means 'already seen', though in usage it is basically equivalent to ''déjà vécu'', "already lived".
* ''[[Tip of the tongue|Presque vu]]'': almost, but not quite, remembering something. It is also referred to as ''tip of the tongue''.

Aber in the University of New Hampshire Department of Natural Resources &amp; the Environment|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Aber received a [[Bachelor's degree]] in Engineering and Applied Science ([[Computer Science]]) from [[Yale University]] in 1971 and a Master's and [[Ph.D.]] degrees in 1973 and 1976 in Forestry and Environmental Studies at Yale.&lt;ref name=unh/&gt;&lt;ref name=unhdne/&gt; He was provost and vice president of academic affairs at the University of New Hampshire (2009-2013) and Vice President for Research and Public Service (2003-2007). He is a scientist, educator, administrator and one of the world's leading ecologists.  Aber is internationally known for his groundbreaking work on [[nitrogen cycling]], sustainable [[ecosystem management]], climate change, and the effects of [[acid rain]] on forests. His applied studies of basic research on nutrients movements through forests has  had a major role defining the field of [[ecosystem ecology]].&lt;ref name=yalenews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.yale.edu/2012/10/05/yale-university-graduate-school-honor-four-alumni|title=Yale University Graduate School to honor four alumni|date=October 5, 2010|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific field of [[restoration ecology]] was properly identified by Aber and William Jordan while they were at the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]].&lt;ref name=uwarboretum&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwarboretum.org/research/bibliography/|title=Bibliography of Scientific Papers|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=environmentecology&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment-ecology.com/what-is-ecology/140-restoration-ecology.html|title=Restoration Ecology|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Aber published Terrestrial Ecosystems with Jerry Melillo, which was the first textbook on the ecology of whole ecosystems.&lt;ref name=mbl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/ecosystems/history/|title=History of the Ecosystems Center|accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aber was selected as one of the four 2012 honorees of the [[Wilbur Cross Medal]] by the Yale Alumni Association.&lt;ref name=yalenews/&gt;

==Research area==
Aber's research area is sustainable [[ecosystem]] management. He has applied concepts learned  during the 30 years of studying native forest ecosystems, managed [[woodlot]]s and [[pastures]]. One of his active projects is nutrient and energy balance of the UNH's Organic Dairy Research Farm's which is first in the world. The focus is reducing dependence on external sources of energy and bedding by changing the farm's environmental footprint with static pile aerobic composting techniques to generate heat energy for farm usage. This project is supported by the USDA and AUES and provides research opportunities for undergraduates, graduates and stakeholders. His work measures and monitors the Nitrogen footprint of the University and assesses the value of Life Cycle Analysis in determining environmental impacts.&lt;ref name=unh/&gt;&lt;ref name=unhdne/&gt;

==Bibliography==
Aber has authored or co-authored more than 200 publications and the basic text in his field called, "Terrestrial Ecosystems."&lt;ref name=yalenews/&gt;

'''[[Laboratory]] rotations''' are typically a part of first year graduate school (Ph.D.-oriented) in American universities, especially in the research-oriented areas like [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] where an incoming student is expected to work in 4 to 6 different laboratories (each is called a "rotation") for durations of about 6 to 8 weeks, before making a final decision regarding which group he or she wishes to join.&lt;ref Name="Barker"&gt;{{cite book

Laboratory rotations are uncommon in the British university system, where a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] candidate is accepted into a laboratory soon after joining, and that is partly responsible for shorter duration needed for graduating.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2604">'''Making Sense of Abstinence''' is a collection of 16 lessons for teaching about [[sexual abstinence]] in the context of comprehensive [[sexuality education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getthefactsny.org/educators/documents/NewMakingSenseFlyer.pdf|title=Empire State Acts|website=Getthefactsny.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the Minnesota Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy, Prevention, and Parenting, it is "a [[curriculum]] that takes [[abstinence]] beyond a one-dimensional scope of 'just say no,'...[utilizing] positive and engaging activities to help young people think about [[abstinence]] in a way that values their ability to make decisions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moappp.org/Documents/MakingSenseAbstinence.pdf|format=PDF|title=Making Sense of Abstinence : Lessons for Comprehensive Sexuality Education|website=Moappp.org|date=February 8, 2006|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sample lessons include such titles as "So What's An Abstinence Anyway?" "Hey, Mom?  Hey, Dad? Hey...Gram?  Can We Talk about Abstinence?" "Just Say Know," "Masturbation:  A Touchy Subject," "Handling Horny," and "Some Day:  Making the Transition from Sexual Abstinence".

The manual has received praise from sexuality educators for expanding the way [[sexuality education]] teaches about abstinence, and for teaching the subject in a positive way, unlike other fear-based approaches.  For example, the online journal "Sexual Intelligence" praised "Making Sense of Abstinence" for "not treating kids like robotic idiots."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sexualintelligence.org/newsletters/issue71.html#four|title=Sexual Intelligence by Marty Klein, Ph.D.|website=Sexualintelligence.org|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Abstinence-only]] advocates have criticized the manual for including such topics as [[outercourse]] and [[masturbation]], behaviors they believe should not be acknowledged.  Critics also claim that teenagers should not learn information to protect themselves when their abstinence decisions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faithandfreedom.us/pdf/abstinence_ed.pdf|format=PDF|title=Faith and Freedom|website=Faithandfreedom.us|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of "Making Sense of Abstinence" state that neither the "Just say no" approach, nor the "Always say yes," is appropriate for abstinence education.  Rather, they emphasize that teens need complete information to help them make the best decisions for themselves.

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5407">'''Meteorological intelligence''' is [[information]] measured, gathered, compiled, exploited, analyzed and disseminated by [[Meteorology|meteorologists]], [[Climatology|climatologists]] and [[Hydrology|hydrologists]] to characterize the current state and/or predict the future state of the [[atmosphere]] at a given location and time.  Meteorological intelligence is a subset of [[environmental intelligence]] and is synonymous with the term [[weather intelligence]].  

The earliest known use of the term "meteorological intelligence" in a written document dates to 1854 on pg. 168 of the Eighth Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].  This report discusses the Smithsonian Institution's initiative to transmit meteorological intelligence via [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] lines.  An early reference to "meteorological intelligence" in England dates an 1866 issue of [[Edinburgh Review|The Edinburgh Review]] which was a prominent [[Scottish people|Scottish]] journal during the 19th century (Reeve 1866, pg. 75).  

Another documented, early use of the term dates to 1874 in a historical compilation entitled, "The American Historical Record" (Lossing 1874, pg. 125).  In this book, Lossing uses the term to refer to weather observations transmitted over telegraph lines for the purpose of studying the nature of [[storm]]s with the ultimate goal of enhancing public safety through the issuance of storm warnings.  This mission was carried out by the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Service]] starting in the 1870s who was responsible for communication (via telegraph) of technical [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] for the army as well as "meteorological intelligence" for the general welfare of the country (Ingersoll 1879, pg. 156).

From the viewpoint of the [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence community]], the term meteorological intelligence is more limited in its use referring to the use of [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] or technical means to learn about environmental conditions over enemy territory (Shulsky and Schmitt 2002) as in the [[North Atlantic weather war]]. In the [[military intelligence]] context, weather information is often referred to as meteorological or environmental intelligence (Hinsley 1990, pg. 420; Platt 1957, pg. 14; U.S. Congress, pg. 164). 

With regard to private sector [[meteorology]], the term meteorological intelligence is a broad term of art that is primarily associated with observed and forecast weather information provided to decision makers in one of a number of weather sensitive business areas including: Energy, [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], [[telecommunication]]s, [[transport]]ation, [[aviation]], [[entertainment]], [[Retailing|retail]] and [[construction]] (CMOS 2001, pg. 23) .  It is considered a key aspect of [[weather risk management]] for the legal and [[insurance]] industries.

At the request of [[Thomas Francis Hickey (bishop)|Bishop Thomas Francis Hickey]] of Rochester, five [http://www.ssjrochester.org/ Sisters of St. Joseph] founded Nazareth College of Rochester in 1924. The first class was composed of 25 young women who began their studies in a large mansion on Lake Avenue in [[Rochester, New York]]. The original mansion that housed the college was known as "the Glass House." At that time, the college offered Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees, each with a [[liberal arts]] core. In response to increasing enrollment, the college moved to a larger facility in 1928 at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/nazareth_college/12190480324/ 402 Augustine Street].

===Move to East Avenue===
In January 1942, the college moved to its present campus on East Avenue in the suburb of [[Pittsford (village), New York|Pittsford]]. In the 1950s, the college responded to the need for graduate study by adding majors and by the 1970s offered programs in teacher education and social work.  Study abroad programs and intercollegiate sports were also added in the 1970s. During this time, the college became co-educational and independent of the Roman Catholic Church. 

Nazareth competed in men’s intercollegiate athletics for the first time in 1977. The official nickname of the sports teams became the Golden Flyers — golden for the Nazareth color, and flyers for the bird-like symbol that is part of the old Nazareth logo. Today, Nazareth supports 25 varsity teams. The most recent sport, added in 2018, is women's ice hockey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www2.naz.edu/news/2017/June/331/chris-baudo-named-women-s-hockey-coach-at-nazareth-college].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Expansion===
In the early 2000s, the college purchased adjacent land from the Sisters of St. Joseph, including the former Motherhouse and Infirmary. This acquisition doubled the campus size to its current 150 acres.  As a result of support from college benefactors (including Tom Golisano, the founder of Paychex), the Motherhouse became the Golisano Academic Center. The Infirmary became George Hall, a residence hall that also houses a coffeehouse and late night study area. The decade of the 2000s also saw the construction of additional student housing, including Portka Hall, Clock Tower Commons, and the Lyons and Breen apartment buildings.

In 2003, 30 years after becoming religiously independent, Nazareth College was removed from ''The Official Catholic Directory,'' having been declared no longer a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] institution by [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rochester|Rochester Bishop]] Matthew H. Clark. It was the second time since [[Pope John Paul II]] issued [[Ex Corde Ecclesiae]], the apostolic constitution on Catholic universities in 1990, a bishop declared a historically Catholic college or university to be not Catholic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title = New York Archdiocese Says Marist College 'No Longer Catholic'|accessdate = 2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Nazareth added Peckham Hall, the Integrated Center for Math and Science. Named after lead donors Nancy and Larry Peckham, the $30 million facility supports majors in math and science fields, as well as education programs. It also provides important learning facilities for students in health and human services programs.

In 2015, the York Wellness and Rehabilitation Institute opened after an extensive renovation/expansion of Carroll Hall consolidated and doubled the size of the clinics associated with the college's School of Health and Human Services and added collaboration space.

Brian and Jean Hickey matched this gift, resulting in renaming the center the Hickey Center for Interfaith Studies and Dialogue at Nazareth College. The endowed chair of the Center was left to the IIIT, and they selected Dr. Muhammad Shafiq, who was imam of the Islamic Center of Rochester, the Rochester metropolitan area's largest mosque. The Center is part of Nazareth’s College of Arts and Sciences and located in the Golisano Academic Center.

In this model, [[history]], [[art]], and [[religion]] are all examples of non-sciences.&lt;ref name="Hansson"&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/pseudo-science/ | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author-last=Hansson | author-first=Sven Ove | chapter=Science and Pseudo-Science | date=2017 | publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University | editor-last=Zalta | editor-first=Edward N. | edition=Summer 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5udKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|title=Concepts in Biology|last=Enger|first=Eldon|last2=Ross|first2=Frederick|last3=Bailey|first3=David|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=|isbn=9780077418281|location=|pages=10|language=en|quote=Both scientists and nonscientists seek to gain information and improve understanding in their fields of study. The differences between science and nonscience are based on the assumptions and methods used to gather and organize information and, most important, the way the assumptions are tested. The difference between a scientist and a nonscientist is that a scientist continually challenges and tests principles and assumptions to determine cause-and-effect relationships. A nonscientist may not be able to do so or may not believe that this is important. For example, a historian may have the opinion that, if President Lincoln had not appointed Ulysses S. Grant to be a general in the Union Army, the Confederate States of America would have won the Civil War. Although there can be considerable  argument about the topic, there is no way that it can be tested. Therefore, such speculation about historical events is not scientific. This does not mean that history is not a respectable field of study, only that it is not science. Historians simply use the standards of critical thinking that are appropriate to their field of study and that can provide insights into the role military leadership plays in the outcome of conflicts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classifying knowledge ==
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
Since the 17th century, some writers have used the word ''science'' to exclude some areas of studies, such as [[the arts]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|science|accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''nonscience'', to describe non-scientific academic disciplines, was first used in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Nonscience|accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, it can be difficult to identify exact boundaries between science and non-science.  The [[demarcation problem]] is the study of the difficulties in determining whether certain fields of study, near the boundaries of science and non-science, should be considered as one or the other.  No single test has yet been devised that can clearly separate science from non-science, but some factors, taken as a whole and evaluated over time, are commonly used.&lt;ref name="Nickles"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/rationality-historicist/|title=Historicist Theories of Scientific Rationality|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Nickles|first=Thomas|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|location=|pages=|quote=What demarcates science from nonscience and pseudoscience is sustained support (over historical time) of a puzzle-solving tradition, not the application of a nonexistent "scientific method" to determine whether the claims are true or false or probable to some degree.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the view of [[Thomas Kuhn]], these factors include the desire of scientists to investigate a question as if it were a puzzle.  Kuhn's view of science is also focused on the process of scientific inquiry, rather than the result.&lt;ref name="Nickles" /&gt;

[[Boundary-work]] is the process of advocating for a desired outcome in the process of classifying fields of study that are near the borders.  The rewards associated with winning a particular classification suggest that the boundary between science and non-science is [[socially constructed]] and [[Ideology|ideologically motivated]] rather than representing a stark natural difference between science and non-science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gieryn |first=Thomas F. |title=Boundary-work and the demarcation of science from non-science: strains and interests in professional ideologies of scientists |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=48 |year=1983 |issue=6 |pages=781–795 |doi=10.2307/2095325 |jstor=2095325}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The belief that scientific knowledge (e.g., biology) is more valuable than other forms of knowledge (e.g., ethics) is called ''[[scientism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-pGDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19|title=Scientism: Science, Ethics and Religion: Science, Ethics and Religion|last=Stenmark|first=Mikael|date=2018-01-12|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781351815390|location=|pages=19–20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of non-science ==
{{Seealso|Outline of academic disciplines#Humanities}}
Non-science includes all areas of study that are not science.&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;  Non-science encompasses all of the [[humanities]], including:

* history,&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; including the [[history of science]],
* the [[language arts]], such as [[linguistics]], specific languages, and [[literature]], 
* [[philosophy]], ethics, and religion, and 
* art, including music, performing arts, fine arts, and [[Handicraft|crafts]].

The philosopher [[Martin Mahner]] proposed calling these academic fields the [[Parascience|''parasciences'']], to distinguish them from disreputable forms of non-science, such as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;

Non-sciences offer information about the [[meaning of life]], [[human values]], the [[human condition]], and ways of interacting with other people, including studies of [[Culture|cultures]], [[morality]] and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/96/Science_and_Non-Science|title=Science and Non-Science|last=Lazorko|first=Pamela|date=2013|website=Philosophy Now|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-17|volume=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVJ3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=178|title=Darwin's Gift: To Science and Religion|last=Ayala|first=Francisco|date=2007-05-07|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|year=|isbn=9780309661744|location=|pages=178|language=en|quote=Successful as it is, and universally encompassing as its subject is, a scientific view of the world is hopelessly incomplete.

== Areas of disagreement ==
[[File:Illustration of overlapping communities.svg|alt=diagram representing multiple connected and overlapping groups|thumb|Some philosophers see knowledge as the product of overlapping communities of knowledge.  Others try to find a sharp division between science and non-science.]]

Philosophers disagree about whether areas of study involving [[abstract concepts]], such as [[pure mathematics]], are scientific or non-scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Alan (1997).[https://books.google.com/books?id=9AgrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Mathematical Enculturation: A Cultural Perspective on Mathematics Education."] Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers.  p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge 1998"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Philosophy of Science: Volume 1, From Problem to Theory|last1=Bunge|first1=Mario|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-765-80413-1|edition=revised|series=|volume=1|location=New York, NY|pages=3–50|language=|chapter=The Scientific Approach|doi=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interdisciplinarity|Interdisciplinary studies]] may cover knowledge-generating work that includes both scientific and non-scientific studies. [[Archaeology]] is an example of a field that borrows from both the natural sciences and history.&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;

Fields of inquiry may change status over time.  For many centuries, [[alchemy]] was accepted as scientific:  it produced some useful information, and it supported experiments and open inquiry in the pursuit of understanding the physical world. Since the 20th century, it has been considered a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/alchemy-may-not-been-pseudoscience-we-thought-it-was-180949430/|title=Alchemy May Not Have Been the Pseudoscience We All Thought It Was|last=Conniff|first=Richard|date=February 2014|work=Smithsonian Magazine|access-date=2018-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwFKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|title=Pseudoscience: The Conspiracy Against Science|last=Hecht |first=David K.|chapter=Pseudoscience and the Pursuit of Truth |editor-last1=Kaufman|editor-first1=Allison B.|editor-last2=Kaufman|editor-first2=James C.|date=2018-01-05|publisher=MIT Press|year=|isbn=9780262037426|location=|pages=8–9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern [[chemistry]], which developed out of alchemy, is considered a major natural science.

== Alternative systems ==
Some philosophers, such as [[Paul Feyerabend]], object to the effort to classify knowledge into science and non-science.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdkDiqh5ySYC&amp;pg=PA41|title=Defining Science: A Rhetoric of Demarcation|last=Taylor|first=C.A.|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1996|isbn=9780299150341|series=Rhetoric of the Human Sciences Series|page=41|lccn=96000180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction is artificial, as there is little or nothing that ties together all of the bodies of knowledge that are called "sciences".&lt;ref name="Taylor1996" /&gt;

Some systems of organizing knowledge separate [[systematic knowledge]] from non-systematic methods of knowing or learning something, such as [[Personal experience|personal experiences]], [[intuition]], and [[innate knowledge]]. [[Wissenschaft]] is a broad concept that encompasses reliable knowledge without making a distinction between subject area.&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;  The ''Wissenschaft'' concept is more useful than the distinction between science and non-science in distinguishing between knowledge and pseudo-knowledge, as the errors made in all forms of [[pseudo-scholarship]], from [[pseudohistory]] to [[pseudoscience]], are similar.&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;  This ''Wissenschaft'' concept is used in the 2006 list of [[Fields of Science and Technology]] published by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], which defines "science and technology" as encompassing all humanistic disciplines, including religion and fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Revised Field of Science and Technology (FOS) Classification in the Frascati Manual {DSTI/EAS/STP/NESTI(2006)19/FINAL)|date=2007|url=http://www.oecd.org/science/innovationinsciencetechnologyandindustry/38235147.pdf|author=Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators|place=|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|language=English|format=PDF|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Passion: An Essay on Personality''''' is a philosophical inquiry into [[human nature]] by philosopher and politician [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]]. The book explores the individual and his relation to society, asking how one comes to an understanding of self and others. Unger here sees the root human predicament as the need to establish oneself as a unique individual in the world but at the same time to find commonality and solidarity with others. This exploration is grounded in what Unger calls a modernist image of the human being as one who lives in context but is not bound by context.

Unger’s aim is twofold. First, to level a critique, expansion, and defense of modern thinking about the human and society “so that this practice can better withstand the criticisms that philosophy since [[David Hume|Hume]] and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] has leveled against it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=vii}}&lt;/ref&gt; And second, to develop a prescriptive theory of human identity centered on what Unger calls [[Passions (philosophy)|the passions]]—our raw responses to the world that are ambivalent towards reasons but also act in the service of reason. He outlines nine passions that organize and are organized by our dealings with others: lust, despair, hatred, vanity, jealousy, envy, faith, hope, and love. While these emotional states may be seen as raw emotion, their expression is always conditioned by the context within which the individual mobilizes or learns to mobilize them.

The book was critically hailed as successfully grappling with some of the most fundamental and enduring problems of human existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=768–771|doi=10.2307/1288775}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been put into direct dialogue with Kant's moral law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weirib|first=Ernest J.|title=Enduring Passion|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=June 1985|volume=94|issue=7|pages=1825–1841}}&lt;/ref&gt; and said to have provided one answer to [[Hume's Guillotine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1066-`083|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unger's analysis and the program he builds around this revolutionary understanding has also inspired new thinking and approaches to psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=791–816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Entering into a long philosophical tradition of inquiry into human nature, Unger begins by categorically rejecting the idea of a natural order to the world or a natural state of human organization. For Unger, there are no natural laws. Rather, he takes to the hilt the modernist thesis that we are shaped by context but not bound by context. As such, we have the power to work both within and beyond any constraints of social or cultural binds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Social Theory|year=2004|publisher=Verso|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This perspective is derived from the Christian-Romantic tradition. Unger argues that this tradition has two themes: interpersonal relations with love as the redemptive moment, and that a person's identity is not defined by membership in social ranks and division. This then gives expression to the idea that humans are never at home in the world and that they are constantly striving to remake the world. The modernist development takes up this theme but emphasizes interpersonal relations over impersonal reality or good so that no institutional settings can limit the possibilities of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; We “can assert [our] independence only by perpetual war against the fact of contextually…”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normative force ===
In laying forth a view of human nature and prescription of self-affirmation, Unger recognizes that he faces the predicament of employing one system of thought that has developed out of particular historical circumstances and is thus no better or worse than any other system of thought. Indeed, under what auspices can such a philosophical orientation be turned into a normative prescription?

Unger turns this question from one of general principles to one of the enactment of a vision or project of self-affirmation. For Unger, at issue here is not the pure speculation of philosophical inquiry into the nature of human beings and their activities, but rather a transformative project of self and society. In this way, the task is to realize a vision and enact a program of self-affirmation. The only alternative is to find a better one or fail at self-affirmation.&lt;ref name="Unger 48"&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standards by which Unger confirms a project of self-affirmation are as follows: socially it is unstable if it fails to deal with behavior predispositions or material constraints, and existentially it fails if it disregards recurrent features of our experience, e.g. dependence upon others.&lt;ref name="Unger 48"/&gt;

Unger looks closely at existential projects that fail: the heroic ethic (delusional about historic setting, which negates the ethic), and the impersonal absolute ethic ([[Buddhism]], which tries but cannot divest itself of the world). Both respond to the fact of the individual not being the center of the world. However, by doing so they disengage from the world and others. While [[Confucianism]] addresses interdependence, the philosophy elevates it to a level of canonical hierarchy and thus imposes strict constraints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Towards a psychology of empowerment ===
Unger sees the Christian-Romantic tradition as the one tradition that puts the individual at the center of the world and gives him the tools for the liberation of self and environment. However, similar to the world's religious and philosophical traditions, it fails to provide a lasting answer to the predicament of human existence. This failure is the constant danger that after liberation the self will return to its customary affairs and routine practices. Rather than moving onwards to greater feats of humanity and godlike existence, the individual will allow everyday affairs to again take over. This surrender to habit is directly linked to the defeat of the imagination. Thus metaphysical revolution is needed through a psychology of empowerment and an analysis of social conditions upon which this empowerment relies. Unger’s project begins here.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
Passion begins with a long introductory foray into the [[Western philosophical tradition]] of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger that is at the heart of our relations with others. This definition is developed out of the argument that the individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion is at the heart of this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.&lt;ref name="BJ 1070"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1070|doi=10.2307/1340886|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5799&amp;context=faculty_scholarship}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part two, Unger attempts to explain how one becomes capable of passion. He charts out a path by which the individual first has desire, which is then augmented with imagination. The imagination reveals an insatiability of the infinite sense of self, which is but then contingent upon the acceptance of others. With this recognition, then, the contingency of the self is revealed. With the further realization of death we come to see that nothing outside of the self can fulfill desire; we want to see the self as transcending all of the fixed social world.

In part three, Unger addresses the passions themselves. As James Glass in ''Political Psychology'' writes, "Not only do these passions civilize and humanize experience; their practice transcends social status, framework, and stratification. Existing beyond class and history, they possess an autonomy that resists the disintegrative pull of power and self-interest, the historical and social differences induced by envy, jealousy, pride, and vanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glass|first=James|title=Review|journal=Political Psychology|date=December 1986|volume=7|issue=4|pages=799|doi=10.2307/3791216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unger describes each one in a way that brings out the need-danger antinomy and the context dependent-transcended dichotomy.&lt;ref name="BJ 1070"/&gt;

* Lust and despair are proto-social destructive forces that must be tamed for civil order to ensue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Hatred, vanity, jealousy, and envy underscore failures to accept one another's presence in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Faith, hope, and love resolve conflicts that seemed insoluble and break through barriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=Passion: An Essay on Personality|year=1986|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=0-02-933180-3|pages=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part four charts the task ahead, which Unger says is to find the collective equivalents to the personal experiences of love, faith, and hope. We must strive to discover the structures that can realize these passions in the everyday world. All too often visions of the future human and environment exclude from social life the personal connections represented in the passions, choosing instead to focus on the recreation of the material world. Unger’s call, however, is to take full account of the passions so we may transcend our context and become more godlike.&lt;ref name="MLR 771"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Review|journal=Michigan Law Review|date=February 1985|volume=83|issue=4|pages=771}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book’s appendix is "A Program for Late Twentieth-Century Psychiatry," an apropos article previously published in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Unger|first=Roberto Mangabeira|title=A Program for Late Twentieth-Century Psychiatry|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|date=February 1982|volume=139|issue=2|pages=155–164|doi=10.1176/ajp.139.2.155}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose argument can be summed up as "psychoanalytic theory offers opportunities to replicate, but not to transform, individual and social contexts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1071|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The book has been met with critical but high acclaim in both legal and philosophical circles. In his ''Times'' review, Jerome Neu, celebrated the book as "some of the most brilliant writing of this kind since Hegel."  Other reviewers have similarly praised it for its "heretical presence both in contemporary social science and philosophy, a point of view that refuses both the "scorched earth campaign of radical skepticism" and the limitations of a social and political theory that roots meaning in transcendental or metaphysical absolutes."&lt;ref name="GJ 802"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glass|first=James|title=Review|journal=Political Psychology|date=December 1986|volume=7|issue=4|pages=802|doi=10.2307/3791216 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet reviewers have also expressed reservations over "Unger's style, his normative reflections, his erudition and elusiveness."&lt;ref name="GJ 802"/&gt; The ''Michigan Law Review'' asked for a more concrete articulation of Unger's idea, claiming that he left both his idea of the individual and program for psychiatry too ambiguous. "That Unger's best society would be a place of playfulness and laughter is, however, only implicit in Passion, and Unger's failure to describe the mirthfulness of the world of love exemplifies the speculative tone that marks the central failure of the work as a whole."&lt;ref name="MLR 771"/&gt; Similarly, James Boyle in the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'' said that the speculative philosophy detracted from the effectiveness of the message, and thought the argument would have been better served with personal example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Boyle|first=James|title=Modernist Social Theory: Roberto Unger's "Passion"|journal=Harvard Law Review|date=March 1985|volume=98|issue=5|pages=1083|doi=10.2307/1340886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. Allan Hobson, in the pages of the ''Northwestern University Law Review'', capitalized on the inspiration of Unger's thesis to develop a new psychiatric program in "advanc[ing] from a set of slogans to testable hypotheses."&lt;ref name="Hobson 792"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=792}}&lt;/ref&gt; He praised Unger for pinpointing the root of the problem--"Psychoanalysis is out of gas, and biological psychiatry is not yet up to speed. As a field in crisis, psychiatry is ripe for change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobson|first=J. Allan|title=Psychiatry As Scientific Humanism:  A Program Inspired by Roberto Unger's Passion|journal=Northwestern University Law Review|year=1987|volume=81|issue=4|pages=791}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but found Unger's theory of personality and program "hopelessly inadequate" because it was too speculative and failed to address biological data.&lt;ref name="Hobson 792"/&gt; Hobson attempted to develop a theory that would incorporate this biological data.

The '''Players Ball''' is an annual gathering of [[pimps]], held in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Other Players Balls take place across the country, most notably in [[Miami]] and [[Atlanta]]. Presently, there are "Players Ball" events in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. On December 16-18th 2011, a Players Ball was hosted in [[Hollywood, CA]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://playersball.com/ |title=The Players Ball Hollywood 2011 presented by Bishop Don Magic Juan, Snoop Dogg, &amp; Serious Pimp - Chuuuch!!! |publisher=Playersball.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614191923/http://playersball.com/ |archivedate=2013-06-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Official Bishop Don Juan Players Ball==
The 38th annual official Players Ball 2012 was held Saturday December 8, 2012 at the Key Club, Hollywood, Ca. Nick Cannon was the Dj for the event who is rumored to be in production filming a movie about Bishop Don Juan.

The 35th Anniversary of the Players Ball, was held on Saturday, December 5, 2009 at Chez Roues Banquet Hall in [[Chicago, IL]]. Ditch performed his first Players Ball show there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zUDAxa7g1QY |title=Ditch Bishop Don Juan Other Players In Hotel Room Chicago Il.Wmv |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-12-11 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea stemmed from a scene in the 1973 [[blaxploitation]] film, ''[[The Mack]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070350/ The Mack (1973) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the lead character, a [[pimp]] named Goldie, attends The Players Ball in [[Oakland, California]].   Comedian [[Dan Aykroyd]] parodied this event in his film [[Doctor Detroit]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085450/ Doctor Detroit (1983) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dave Chappelle]] satirized the event with "The Playa Haters' Ball" on an episode of [[The Chappelle Show]].  The party has been a November tradition since 1974, when pimps from across the country gathered to celebrate the birthday of Don Juan now known as [[Don "Magic" Juan|Bishop Don "Magic" Juan]]. Every year, the award for "Pimp of the Year" is given out. Juan was the winner 13 years in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dowling |first=Denise |url=http://archive.salon.com/health/sex/urge/2000/01/29/pimps/ |title="Pimpin' is hard work" - Salon.com |publisher=Archive.salon.com |date=2000-01-29 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentaries==
The Player's Ball was shown in the [[HBO]] documentary ''[[Pimps Up, Ho's Down]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0214005/ Pimps Up, Ho's Down (1999) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hughes Brothers]]' documentary, ''[[American Pimp]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0179074/ American Pimp (1999) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A DVD entitled Master Players Ball was also released in 2006. The DVD featured live scenes from a "Players Ball."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Masters-Players-Ball-Various/dp/B000FFP12W |title=Masters Players Ball: Various: Movies &amp; TV |publisher=Amazon.com |date=2007-01-23 |accessdate=2013-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===2003 arrests===
In 2015, the Players Ball took place in [[Atlanta, GA]]. A former prostitute by the name of "Tina F." reported that several [[pimp]]s were arrested for having [[Prostitution of children|underage prostitutes]], and claimed "Two years ago in Atlanta, they stopped it and arrested 15 pimps and charged them. One pimp had a 10-year-old girl in his stable." &lt;ref name="tribe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribes.tribe.net/humantrafficking/thread/6856dd15-bc5f-410d-95ab-c12b4e9d8038 |title=Stop Glamorizing Pain - Stop Glamori... - Human Trafficking - tribe.net |publisher=Tribes.tribe.net |date=2005-12-05 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 protest===
In 2005, a former prostitute identifying herself as "Brenda Myers-Powell." protested the Players Ball event at Mariella's Banquet Hall on 5th Avenue in [[Maywood, IL]]. Brenda called the event a "ball for child molesters" because she began being trafficked by pimps at the age of 14 and says her experience is a common one.&lt;ref name="tribe1"/&gt;

===Matthew Thompkins indictment===
In 2006, Matthew Thompkins, a former Postal Worker of [[Manhattanville]], NY, was indicted. He was a former "Pimp of the Year" of the annual Players Ball. His aliases included; "Knowledge" and "Daddy." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/1129189101.html?dids=1129189101:1129189101&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+18%2C+2006&amp;author=JEANE+MacINTOSH&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc='PIMP+OF+THE+YEAR'+-+POSTAL+WORKER+BUSTED&amp;pqatl=google |title=Archives - New York Post Online Edition |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=2006-09-18 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; While searching his property, Police located two "Pimp of the Year" awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1182229C22A32448&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Philadelphia Inquirer |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=2007-03-24 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other versions==

===Las Vegas, Nevada===
A well-known non-pimp Players Ball started in 1999 was thrown in Las Vegas and New Orleans as a private party for businesses attending adult oriented events. The event is organized by D-Money.  The event was thrown twice a year and may coincide with other adult events such as AVN or Internext Expo.  The last players ball event thrown by D-money, who has officially ended the events, was on June 9, 2010.  Official Website http://www.theplayersball.com

===Memphis, Tennessee===
In 2011, the annual Memphis Players Ball was also attended by [[Don "Magic" Juan|Bishop Don Magic Juan]], Good Game, MattShizzle, Candyman, The Black Hef and others. Ditch performed at the Memphis Ball which was located at a mansion in Memphis, TN.

'''Policy analysis''' is a technique used in [[public administration]] to enable [[civil servant]]s, [[Activism|activists]], and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials. The process is also used in the administration of large organizations with complex policies. It has been defined as the process of "determining which of various [[Policy|policies]] will achieve a given set of goals in light of the relations between the policies and the goals."&lt;ref&gt;

* Analysis {{em|for}} new policy, which is prescriptive – it is involved with formulating policies and proposals (for example: to improve social welfare)

The areas of interest and the purpose of analysis determine what types of analysis are conducted. A combination of two kinds of policy analyses together with [[program evaluation]] is defined as ''[[policy studies]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Hambrick, Ralph Jr. |last2= Bardach |first2= Eugene |last3= Chelimsky |first3= Eleanor |last4= Shadish |first4= William R. |last5= Deleon |first5= Peter |last6= Fischer |first6= Frank |last7= MacRae |first7= Duncan |last8= Whittington |first8= Dale |title= Review: Building the Policy Studies Enterprise: A Work in Progress |journal= Public Administration Review |volume= 58 |issue= 6 |pages= 533–9 |date= November–December 1998 |doi= 10.2307/977580|jstor= 977580}}&lt;/ref&gt; Policy analysis is frequently deployed in the [[public sector]], but is equally applicable elsewhere, such as [[nonprofit organization]]s and [[non-governmental organization]]s.

&lt;/ref&gt; in the 1960s.

==Approaches==
Various approaches to policy analysis exist. The analysis ''for'' policy (and analysis ''of'' policy) is the central approach in [[social science]] and educational policy studies. It is linked to two different traditions of policy analysis and research frameworks. The approach of analysis ''for'' policy refers to research conducted for actual policy development, often commissioned by policymakers inside the bureaucracy (e.g., senior civil servants) within which the policy is developed. Analysis ''of'' policy is more of an academic exercise, conducted by academic researchers, professors and [[think tank]] researchers, who are often seeking to understand why a particular policy was developed at a particular time and assess the effects, intended or otherwise, of that policy when it was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Khorsandi Taskoh, Ali. [http://ir.lib.uwo.ca/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3340&amp;context=etd A Critical Policy Analysis of Internationalization in Postsecondary Education: An Ontario Case Study], ''The University of Western Ontario'', October 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three approaches that can be distinguished: the analysis-centric, the policy process, and the meta-policy approach.&lt;ref name="Bührs93"/&gt;

===Analysis-centric===
The analysis-centric (or "analycentric") approach focuses on individual problems and their solutions. Its scope is the micro-scale and its problem interpretation or problem resolution usually involves a technical solution. The primary aim is to identify the most effective and efficient solution in technical and economic terms (e.g. the most efficient allocation of resources).

===Policy process===
The policy process approach puts its focal point onto political processes and involved [[stakeholder analysis|stakeholders]]; its scope is the broader meso-scale and it interprets problems using a political lens (i.e., the interests and goals of elected officials). It aims at determining what processes, means and policy instruments (e.g., [[regulation]], [[legislation]], [[subsidy]]) are used. As well, it tries to explain the role and influence of stakeholders within the policy process &lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2015).  Making policy connections across scales using nexus analysis. In F.M. Hult &amp; D.C Johnson (Eds.), &lt;i&gt;Research methods in language policy and planning: A practical guide&lt;/i&gt; (pp. 217-231). Malden, MA: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 2010s, ''stakeholders'' is defined broadly to include citizens, community groups, non-governmental organizations, businesses and even opposing political parties. By changing the relative power and influence of certain groups (e.g., enhancing public participation and consultation), solutions to problems may be identified that have more "buy in" from a wider group. One way of doing this followed a [[heuristic]] model called the ''[[Policy#Policy cycle|policy cycle]]''. In its simplest form, the policy cycle, which is often depicted visually as a loop or circle, starts with the identification of the problem, proceeds to an examination of the different policy tools that could be used to respond to that problem, then goes on to the implementation stage, in which one or more policies are put into practice (e.g., a new regulation or subsidy is set in place), and then finally, once the policy has been implemented and run for a certain period, the policy is evaluated. A number of different viewpoints can be used during evaluation, including looking at a policy's effectiveness, [[cost-effectiveness]], value for money, outcomes or outputs.

===Meta-policy===
The meta-policy approach is a systems and context approach; i.e., its scope is the macro-scale and its problem interpretation is usually of a structural nature. It aims at explaining the contextual factors of the policy process; i.e., what the political, economic and socio-cultural factors are that influence it. As problems may result because of structural factors (e.g., a certain economic system or political institution), solutions may entail changing the structure itself.

==Methodology==
Policy analysis uses both [[qualitative methods]] and [[quantitative methods]]. Qualitative research includes [[case studies]] and interviews with community members. Quantitative research includes [[survey research]], [[statistical analysis]] (also called ''data analysis'') and [[model building]]. A common practice is to define the problem and evaluation criteria; identify and evaluate alternatives; and recommend a certain policy accordingly. Promotion of the best agendas are the product of careful "back-room" analysis of policies by ''[[a priori knowledge|a priori]]'' assessment and ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]'' evaluation.

===Dimensions for analyzing policies===
There are six dimensions to policy analysis categorized as the effects and implementation of the policy across a period of time. Also collectively known as "Durability" of the policy, which means the capacity in content of the policy to produce visible effective compatible change or results over time with robustness.&lt;ref&gt;Salamon, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Effects'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Effectiveness''' || What effects does the policy have on the targeted problem?
|-
| '''Unintended effects'''&lt;ref&gt;Rychetnik et al., 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the [[unintended effects]] of this policy?
|-
| '''Equity'''&lt;ref&gt;Potvin et al., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; || What are the effects of this policy on different population groups?
|}

'''Implementation'''
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| '''Cost''' || What is the financial cost of this policy (some analysts also include [[tax credit]]s in this analysis)?
|-
| '''Feasibility''' || Is the policy technically feasible?
|-
| '''Acceptability'''&lt;ref&gt;Peters, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; || Do the relevant policy stakeholders view the policy as acceptable?
|}

The strategic effects dimensions can pose certain limitations due to data collection. However the analytical dimensions of effects directly influences acceptability. The degree of acceptability is based upon the plausible definitions of actors involved in feasibility. If the feasibility dimension is compromised, it will put the implementation at risk, which will entail additional costs. Finally, implementation dimensions collectively influence a policy's ability to produce results or impacts.

===Five-E approach===
One model of policy analysis is the "five-E approach", which consists of examining a policy in terms of:&lt;ref name="Kirst-Ashman"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bHQcCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |series=Empowerment Series |title=Introduction to Social Work &amp; Social Welfare: Critical Thinking Perspectives |first=Karen K. |last=Kirst-Ashman |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=January 1, 2016 |pages=234–236}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Effectiveness: How well does it work (or how well will it be predicted to work)?
;Efficiency: How much work does or will it entail? Are there significant costs associated with this solution, and are they worth it?
;[[Ethics|Ethical]] considerations: Is it ethically and morally sound?  Are there [[unintended consequences]]?
;Evaluations of alternatives: How good is it compared to other approaches?  Have all the relevant other approaches been considered?
;Establishment of recommendations for positive change: What can actually be implemented? Is it better to amend, replace, remove, or add a policy?

===Framework===
Policies are considered as frameworks that can optimize the general well-being. These are commonly analyzed by legislative bodies and lobbyists. Every policy analysis is intended to bring an evaluative outcome. A systemic policy analysis is meant for in depth study for addressing a social problem. Following are steps in a policy analysis:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jillian Jimenez|author2=Eileen Mayers Pasztor|author3=Ruth M. Chambers |author4=Cheryl Pearlman Fujii |title=Social Policy and Social Change: Toward the Creation of Social and Economic Justice|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hU0XBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA25|date=2014|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4833-2415-9|pages=25–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Defining the problem assessed by the policy.
# Assessing policy objectives and its target populations.
# Studying effects of the policy.
# Policy implications: distribution of resources, changes in services rights and statuses, tangible benefits. 
# Alternative policies: surveying existing and possible policy models that could have addressed the problem better or parts of it which could make it effective.

==Evidence based models==
Many models exist to analyze the development and implementation of [[public policy]]. Analysts use these models to identify important aspects of policy, as well as explain and predict policy and its consequences. Each of these models are based upon the types of policies.

===Types===
* Government (e.g. federal, provincial, municipal)
* Policies adopted within public institutions (e.g. hospitals, child care centers, schools)
* Workplace (e.g. policies that govern employees and employee-manager relations)&lt;ref&gt;Kim Bergeron, Florence Morestin et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some evidence supported models are:

===Governments===

Public policy is determined by a range of political institutions, which give policy [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] to policy measures. In general, the government applies policy to all citizens and monopolizes the use of force in applying or implementing policy (through government control of [[law enforcement]], [[court]] systems, [[imprisonment]] and [[armed forces]]). The [[legislature]], [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[judicial]] branches of government are examples of institutions that give policy legitimacy. Many countries also have independent, quasi-independent or [[arm's length]] bodies which, while funded by government, are independent from elected officials and political leaders. These organizations may include government [[commission (remuneration)|commission]]s, [[tribunal]]s, [[regulation|regulatory agencies]] and electoral commissions.

====Process model====
{{See also|Policy#Policy cycle|l1=Policy cycle}}

Policy creation is a process that typically follows a sequence of steps or stages:
* Identification of a problem (also called "problem definition") and demand for government action. Different stakeholders may define the same issue as different problems. For example, if [[homelessness|homeless people]] are using [[illegal drug]]s such as [[heroin]] in a city park, some stakeholders may define this as a [[law enforcement]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if police presence in the park is stepped up and if the individuals using illegal drugs are arrested and punished); on the other hand, other stakeholders may view this as a [[poverty]] and [[public health]] issue (which, in their view, could be best solved if [[public health nurse]]s and government [[medical doctor]]s and [[substance abuse]] counsellors were sent to the park to do [[outreach]] with the drug-using individuals, and encourage them to voluntarily enter "[[detoxification]]" or [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] programs).
* Agenda setting
* Formulation of policy proposals by various parties (e.g., citizen groups, congressional committees, [[think tank]]s, [[interest group]]s, [[lobby group]]s, [[non-governmental organization]]s).
* Policy selection/adoption and legal enactment of a selected policy by elected officials and/or houses of representatives. At this stage, '''policy legitimation''' is conferred upon the selected policy solution(s).
* Policy implementation, which involves [[civil servant]]s putting the selected policy option into practice. Depending on the choice made by the executive or legislative branch, this could involve creating new [[regulation]] (or [[Deregulation|removing existing regulations]]), creating new laws, creating a new government program or service, creating a new [[subsidy]] or [[grant (money)|grant]], etc.
* Policy [[evaluation]]. After the policy has been in place for a year or several years, [[civil servant]]s or an independent [[consulting firm]] assesses the policy, to see if the goals were achieved, if the policy was implemented effectively, etc.

This model, however, has been criticized for being overly linear and simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;Young, John and Enrique Mendizabal. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1127&amp;title=become-policy-entrepreneur-roma Helping researchers become policy entrepreneurs], [[Overseas Development Institute]], London, September 2009. &lt;!--accessed 07 October 2009--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, stages of the policy process may overlap or never happen. Also, this model fails to take into account the multiple factors attempting to influence the process itself as well as each other, and the complexity this entails.

===For public institutions===

One of the most widely used model for public institutions are of [[Herbert A. Simon]], the father of rational models. It is also used by private corporations. However, many criticise the model due to characteristics of the model being impractical and relying on unrealistic assumptions. For instance, it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex, ill-defined and interdependent. The problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extraordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings.

====Rational model====
:''See [[Rational planning model]] for a fuller discussion''

The rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy-making in the public sector. Rationality is defined as “a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Herbert, Simon |title=[[Administrative Behavior]] |publisher=The Free Press |location=New York |year=1976 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-684-83582-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions, such as: 'The model must be applied in a system that is stable'; 'The government is a rational and unitary actor and that its actions are perceived as rational choices'; 'The policy problem is unambiguous'; 'There are no limitations of time or cost'.

Furthermore, in the context of the public sector policy models are intended to achieve maximum social gain. Simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions. Ian Thomas describes Simon's steps as follows:

#Intelligence gathering — A comprehensive organization of data; potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.
#Identifying problems — Accounting for relevant factors.
#Assessing the consequences of all options — Listing possible consequences and alternatives that could resolve the problem and ranking the probability that each potential factor could materialize in order to give a correct priority to said factor in the analysis.
#Relating consequences to values — With all policies there will be a set of relevant dimensional values (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and a set of criteria for appropriateness, against which performance (or consequences) of each option being responsive can be judged.
#Choosing the preferred option — The policy is brought through from fully understanding the problems, opportunities, all the consequences &amp; the criteria of the tentative options and by selecting an optimal alternative with consensus of involved actors.&lt;ref name=Thomas07&gt;{{cite book |editor=Thomas, Ian |title=Environmental Policy: Australian Practice in the Context of Theory |publisher=Federation Press |location=Sydney |year=2007 |isbn=1-86287-603-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere. Nonetheless, there are some who criticize the rational model due to the major problems which can be faced &amp; which tend to arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1005469411776 |author1=Morgan M.G. |author2=Kandlikar M. |author3=Risbey J. |author4=Dowlatabadi H. |title=Why Conventional Tools for Policy Analysis Are Often Inadequate for Problems of Global Change |journal=Climatic Change |volume=41 |issue=3-4 |pages=271–281 |date=19 March 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the assumptions stated by Simon are never fully valid in a real world context.

Further criticism of the rational model include: leaving a gap between planning and implementation, ignoring of the role of people, entrepreneurs, leadership, etc., the insufficiency of technical competence (i.e. ignoring the human factor), reflecting too mechanical an approach (i.e. the organic nature of organizations), requiring of multidimensional and complex models, generation of predictions which are often wrong (i.e. simple solutions may be overlooked), &amp; incurring of cost (i.e. costs of rational-comprehensive planning may outweigh the cost savings of the policy).

However, Thomas R. Dye, the president of the Lincoln Center for Public Service, states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized. Thus, it does not seem strange that “we ought to be trying for rational decision-making”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dye, Thomas R. |title=Understanding Public Policy |publisher=Prentice Hall |edition=12th |year=2007 |isbn=0-13-936948-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incremental policy====
{{More|Incrementalism}}
An incremental policy model relies on features of incremental decision-making such as: satisfying, organizational drift, bounded rationality, and limited cognition, among others. Such policies are often called "muddling through" &amp; represent a conservative tendency: new policies are only slightly different from old policies. Policy-makers are too short on time, resources, and brains to make totally new policies; as such, past policies are accepted as having some legitimacy. When existing policies have sunk costs which discourage innovation, incrementalism is an easier approach than rationalism, and the policies are more politically expedient because they don't necessitate any radical redistribution of values. Such models necessarily struggle to improve the acceptability of public policy.

Criticisms of such a policy approach include: challenges to bargaining (i.e. not successful with limited resources), downplaying useful quantitative information, obscuring real relationships between political entities, an anti-intellectual approach to problems (i.e. the preclusion of imagination), and a bias towards conservatism (i.e. bias against far-reaching solutions).

===For workplaces===
There are many contemporary policies relevant to gender and workplace issues. Actors analyze contemporary gender-related employment issues ranging from parental leave and maternity programs, sexual harassment, and work/life balance to gender mainstreaming. It is by the juxtaposition of a variety of research methodologies focused on a common theme the richness of understanding is gained. This integrates what are usually separate bodies of evaluation on the role of gender in welfare state developments, employment transformations, workplace policies, and work experience.

====Group model====
This policy is formed as a result of forces and pressures from influential groups. Pressure groups are informally co-opted into the policy making process. Regulatory agencies are captured by those they are supposed to regulate. No one group is dominant all the time on all issues. The group is the bridge between the individual and the administration. The executive is thus pressured by interest groups.

The task of the system is to:
* Establish the rules of the game
* Arrange compromises and balance interests
* Enact compromises in policy
* Enforce these compromises.

====Other====
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
There are several other major types of policy analysis, broadly groupable into competing approaches:

*Empirical versus normative policy analyses
*Retrospective versus prospective analyses
*Prescriptive versus descriptive analyses.

===Techniques used in policy analysis===
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}
*Cost–benefit analysis
*[[Management by objectives]] (MBO)
*Operations research
*Decision-making based on analytics
*[[Program evaluation and review technique]] (PERT)
*[[Critical path method]] (CPM).

==Evaluation==
The success of a policy can be measured by changes in the behavior of the target population and active support from various actors and institutions involved. A public policy is an authoritative communication prescribing an unambiguous course of action for specified individuals or groups in certain situations. There must be an authority or leader charged with the implementation and monitoring of the policy with a sound social theory underlying the program and the target group. Evaluations can help estimate what effects will be produced by program objectives/alternatives.  However, [[Correlation does not imply causation|claims of causality]] can only be made with [[Randomized controlled trial|randomized control trials]] in which the policy change is applied to one group and not applied to a control group and individuals are randomly assigned to these groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Social and Behavioral Sciences Team 2016 Annual Report|journal=Executive Office of the President National Science and Technology Council|date=2016|url=https://sbst.gov/download/2016%20SBST%20Annual%20Report.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haynes|first1=Laura|title=Test, Learn, Adapt: Developing Public Policy with Randomized Controlled Trials|journal=United Kingdom Cabinet Office Behavioral Insights Team|date=2012|url=http://researchonline.lshtm.ac.uk/id/eprint/201256}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Randomized Control Trials to Evaluate Public Policy|url=https://innovation.govspace.gov.au/using-randomised-control-trials-evaluate-public-policy|publisher=Australian Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To obtain compliance of the actors involved, the government can resort to positive sanctions, such as favorable publicity, price supports, tax credits, grants-in-aid, direct services or benefits; declarations; rewards; voluntary standards; mediation; education; demonstration programs; training, contracts; subsidies; loans; general expenditures; informal procedures, bargaining; franchises; sole-source provider awards...etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michelle A. Saint-Germain, California State University&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steps for conducting a policy evaluation===
Policy evaluation is used to examine content, implementation or impact of the policy, which helps to understand the merit, worth and the utility of the policy.

'''Preadolescence''', also known as '''pre-teen''' or '''tween''', is a stage of [[Human development (biology)|human development]] following [[early childhood]] and preceding [[adolescence]].&lt;ref name="NOAD2"&gt;New Oxford American Dictionary. 2nd Edition. 2005. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It commonly ends with the beginning of [[puberty]],&lt;ref name="Cox"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Frank D. Cox, Kevin Demmitt|title=Human Intimacy: Marriage, the Family, and Its Meaning|isbn=1285633040|page=76|year=2013|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pccWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA76}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also be defined as ending with the start of the teenage years.&lt;ref name="nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Puberty and adolescence|publisher=[[MedlinePlus]]|accessdate=July 22, 2014|archivedate=April 3, 2013|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403080324/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001950.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, dictionary definitions generally designate it as 10–13 years.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/preadolescence?qsrc=2446 Dictionary.com --&gt; Definition of preadolescence] (Based on the Random House Dictionary, 2009) Retrieved on July 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Preadolescence can bring its own challenges and [[anxiety|anxieties]].

==Prepubescence, puberty and range==
{{See also|Tanner scale}}
Being prepubescent is not the same thing as being preadolescent. Instead, ''prepubescent'' (and sometimes ''[[child]]'') is a term for boys and girls who have not developed [[secondary sex characteristic]]s,&lt;ref name="Manske"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert C. Manske|title=Fundamental Orthopedic Management for the Physical Therapist Assistant|isbn=0323291376|page=110|year=2015|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NszECQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''preadolescent'' is generally defined as those ranging from age 10 to 13 years.&lt;ref name="dictionary.reference.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hatfield"&gt;{{cite book|author=Nancy T. Hatfield|title=Broadribb's Introductory Pediatric Nursing|isbn=0781777062|page=588|year=2007|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WMsWpXjnWWYC&amp;pg=PA588}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preadolescence may also be defined as the period from 9 to 14 years.&lt;ref name="Corsaro"&gt;William A. Corsaro, ''The Sociology of Childhood'' (2005) p. 191 and p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Donald C. Freeman, ''Essays in Modern Stylistics'' (1981) p. 399&lt;/ref&gt; 

The point at which a child becomes an adolescent is defined by the onset of [[puberty]] or the beginning of the teenage stage.&lt;ref name="Cox"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nlm.nih.gov/&gt;&lt;ref name="Manske"/&gt; Adolescence is also viewed as ending with the teenage stage.&lt;ref name=nlm.nih.gov/&gt; However, in some individuals (particularly females), puberty begins in the preadolescence years.&lt;ref name="Breinbauer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cecilia Breinbauer|title=Youth: Choices and Change : Promoting Healthy Behaviors in Adolescents|isbn=927511594X|page=303|year=2005|accessdate=February 25, 2017|publisher=[[Pan American Health Organization]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=goqyfO8KkFIC&amp;pg=PT303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appelbaum"&gt;{{cite book|author=Heather L.

Ryan et al., ''Juvenile Sexual Offending'' (2010) p. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

One can also distinguish middle childhood and preadolescence&lt;ref name=" Corsaro"/&gt;&amp;nbsp;– middle childhood from approximately 5–8 years, as opposed to the time children are generally considered to reach preadolescence.&lt;ref name="Freeman"/&gt; There is no exact agreement as to when preadolescence starts and ends, and research by Gesell et al. suggests that "chronological time...is by no means identical with developmental time"&amp;nbsp;– the duration of the "inner" stages of growth'&amp;nbsp;– or with physiological time.&lt;ref&gt;A. Gesell et al., ''Youth'' (London 1956) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

While known as ''preadolescent'' in psychology, the terms ''preteen'', ''preteenager'' or ''tween ''are common in everyday use. A preteen or preteenager&lt;ref name="NOAD2" /&gt; is a person 12 and under.&lt;ref name="MWCD11" /&gt; Generally, the term is restricted to those close to reaching age 12,&lt;ref name="NOAD2" /&gt; especially age 11.&lt;ref name="AHDEL4" /&gt; ''Tween'' is an American [[neologism]] and [[marketing]] term&lt;ref name="FamiliarWithTweens"&gt;[http://tourismintelligence.ca/author/maithe/ Levasseur, Maïthé] (2007-02-09).

Retrieved on 2007-12-04.&lt;/ref&gt; for ''preteen'', which is a [[Blend word|blend]] of ''between'' and ''teen''.&lt;ref name="MWCD11"&gt;Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. Eleventh Edition. 2003. Merriam-Webster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHDEL4"&gt;The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. Fourth Edition. 2000. Houghton Mifflin Company.&lt;/ref&gt; People within this age range are variously described as tweens, preadolescents{{self-contradictory inline}}, tweenies, preteens, pubescents, [[junior highers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krafft|first1=Bob|title=Coping With Your Feelings: Five Active Meetings for Your Junior Highers|date=1994|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; or tweenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornburg|first1=Hershel|title=Preadolescent development|date=1974|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hjarvard|first1=Stif Prof|title=The Mediatization of Culture and Society|date=2013|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''tween'' was previously used in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s 1954 novel ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' to refer to [[hobbits]] in their twenties: "''tweens'' as hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and the coming of age at thirty-three."&lt;ref&gt;Tolkien, J. R. R. ''The Lord of the Rings; The Fellowship of the Ring '' Copyright 1965 by J.R.R Tolkien; Ballantine Books, A Division of Random House Inc. SBN 345-24032-4-150&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, the word is really either a shortened version of ''between'' or a portmanteau of ''teen'' and ''twenty'', and in either case has no connection to teens, preteens or the American marketing niche.

==Psychological development==
{{Main article|Developmental psychology}}

Of the 'two major [[socialization|socializing]] agents in children's lives: the family environment...and formal educational institutions,'&lt;ref&gt;Dafna Lemish, ''Children and Television'' (Oxford 2007) p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; it is 'the family in its function a primary socializer of the child'&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, ''The Death of the Family'' (Penguin 1974) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; that predominates in the first five years of life: middle childhood by contrast is characterized by 'a child's readiness for school...being self-assured and interested; knowing what kind of behavior is expected...being able to wait, to follow directions, and getting along with other children.'&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 193&lt;/ref&gt;

Preadolescent children in fact have a different view of the world from younger children in many significant ways. Typically, theirs is a more realistic view of life than the intense, fantasy-oriented world of earliest childhood. Preadolescents have more mature, sensible, realistic thoughts and actions: 'the most "sensible" stage of development...the child is a much ''less emotional being'' now.'&lt;ref&gt;Mavis Klein, ''Okay Parenting'' (1991) p. 13 and p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; They will often have developed a sense of ' ''intentionality''. The wish and capacity to have an impact, and to act upon that with persistence';&lt;ref&gt;daniel Goleman, ''Emotional Intelligence'' (London 1996) p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; and will have a more developed sense of looking into the future and seeing effects of their actions (as opposed to early childhood where children often do not worry about their future). This can include more realistic [[job (role)|job]] expectations ("I want to be an engineer when I grow up", as opposed to "I want to be a wizard"). Middle children generally show more investment 'in ''control over external reality'' through the acquisition of knowledge and competence':&lt;ref&gt;Mavis Klein, ''Okay Parenting'' (1991) p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; where they do have worries, these may be more a [[fear]] of [[kidnapping]]s, [[rape]]s, and scary media events, as opposed to fantasy things (e.g., witches, [[monster]]s, ghosts).

Preadolescents may well view human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s differently (e.g. they may notice the flawed, human side of [[authority]] figures). Alongside that, they may begin to develop a sense of [[self (psychology)|self]]-[[Identity (social science)|identity]], and to have increased feelings of [[independence]]: 'may feel an individual, no longer "just one of the family."'&lt;ref&gt;E. Fenwick/T. Smith, ''Adolescence'' (London 1993) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; A different view on [[morality]] can emerge; and the middle child will also show more ''cooperativeness''. The ability to balance one's own needs with those of others in group activities'.&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; Many preadolescents will often start to question their home life and surroundings around this time and they may also start to form opinions that may differ from their upbringing in regards to issues such as [[politics]], [[religion]], [[sexuality]], and [[gender roles]].

Greater responsibility within the family can also appear, as middle children become responsible for younger siblings and relatives, as with [[babysitting]]; while preadolescents may start caring about what they look like and what they are wearing.

Middle children often begin to experience [[infatuation]], [[limerence]], [[puppy love]], or [[love]] itself, though arguably at least with 'girls carrying out all the romantic interest....preadolescent girls' romantic pursuits often seem to be more aggressive than affectionate.'&lt;ref&gt;Giselle Liza Anatol, ''Reading Harry Potter: Critical Essays'' (2003) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Preadolescents may still suffer [[tantrum]]s at the age of 13, sometimes leading to rash decisions regarding risky actions. Such decisions may in rare cases result in grave situations such as accidental death.&lt;ref name="dailymail 2008"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-180677267.html | title=Boy aged 13 killed himself over Wii ban | work=[[Daily Mail]] | date=June 27, 2008 | accessdate=January 9, 2013}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home from home===
Where development has been optimal, preadolescents 'come to school for something to be added to their lives; they want to learn lessons...which can lead to their eventually working in a job like their parents.'&lt;ref&gt;D. W. Winnicott, ''The Child, the Family, and the Outside World'' (Penguin 1973) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; When earlier developmental stages have gone astray, however, then, on the principle that 'if you miss a stage, you can always go through it later,'&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; some middle children 'come to school for another purpose...[not] to learn but to find a home from home...a stable emotional situation in which they can exercise their own emotional liability, a group of which they can gradually become a part.'&lt;ref&gt;Winnicott, p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divorce===
Children at the threshold of adolescence in the nine-to-twelve-year-old group&lt;ref&gt;Ann Charlton, ''Caught in the Middle'' (London 2003) p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; would seem to have particular vulnerabilities to parental separation. Among such problems were the very 'eagerness of these youngsters to be co-opted into the parental battling; their willingness to take sides...and the intense, compassionate, caretaking relations which led these youngsters to attempt to rescue a distressed parent often to their own detriment.&lt;ref&gt;Charlton, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
Preadolescents may well be more exposed to [[popular culture]] than younger children and have interests based on internet trends, television shows and movies (no longer just cartoons), fashion, technology, music and social media. Preadolescents generally prefer certain [[brand]]s, and are a heavily targeted market of many advertisers. Their tendency to buy brand-name items may be due to a desire to fit in, although the desire is not as strong as it is with teenagers.

Some scholars suggest that 'pre-adolescents&amp;nbsp;... reported frequent encounters with sexual material in the media, valued the information received from it, and used it as a learning resource&amp;nbsp;... and evaluated such content through what they perceived to be sexual morality.'&lt;ref&gt;Dafna Lemish, ''Children and Television'' (Oxford 2007) p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;  However, other research has suggested that sexual media influences on preadolescent and adolescent sexual behavior is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;Steinberg, L., &amp; Monahan, K.  2010.  Developmental Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Freud==
[[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] called this stage the ''[[latency stage|latency]]'' period to indicate that sexual feelings and interest went underground&amp;nbsp;... the ''feelings'' that create that first "eternal triangle" with the parents fade, and free energy for other interests and activities.'&lt;ref&gt;Robin Skynner/John Cleese, ''Families and how to survive them'' (London 1994) p. 271 and p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; [[Erik H. Erikson]] confirmed that 'violent drives are normally dormant&amp;nbsp;... a lull before the storm of [[puberty]], when all the earlier drives re-emerge in a new combination, to be brought under the dominance of genitality.'&lt;ref&gt;Erik H Erikson, ''[[Childhood and Society]]'' (Penguin 1973) p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

Latency period children can then direct more of their energy into asexual pursuits such as school, athletics, and same-sex friendships: middle childhood especially is marked by 'the importance of school, teams, classes, friends, gangs and organised activities&amp;nbsp;... and the adults who run those.'&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Miller, ''Understanding Your 8 year old'' (London 1993) p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, recent research suggests that "most children do not cease sexual development, interest and behavior" at this time: rather, they "cease to share their interest with adults and are less frequently observed."&lt;ref&gt;Ryan, ''Juvenile'' p. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; Because "they've learned the rules&amp;nbsp;... [they] fit in with the grown-up's ''belief'' that they're not interested. But the curiosity about it all continues, and there's quite a lot of experimenting going on between them.'&lt;ref&gt;Skynner/Cleese, ''Families'' p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; alongside other pursuits

But while the eight-year-old still has "years to wait until puberty, adolescence and finally sexual maturity&amp;nbsp;... a sort of lull before puberty arrives,'&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 23 and p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; with preadolescence proper (9–12), and the move forward from middle childhood, what have been called 'the introspective and social concerns of the prepubescent'&lt;ref&gt;Michell Landsberg, ''The World of Children's Books'' (London 1988) p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; tend to come more to the fore. Clearly "few experiences are more prominent in the lives of preadolescents than the onset of puberty";&lt;ref&gt;Anatol, ''Potter'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; so that "at eleven or twelve you're just reaching the end of a long period during which change was steady and incremental":&lt;ref&gt;Francis Spufford, ''The Child that Books Built'' (London 2002) p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Freud's latency years.

'''Primary Care Service Areas''' are geographic areas that are self-sufficient markets of [[primary care]]. These areas are designed in a manner such that the majority of patients living in these areas use primary care services form within the area. This ensures that any [[geographic targeting]] of policies and resources reach the patients they are meant for. These geographies have been created in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazumdar | first1 = S. | last2 = Feng| first2 = X. | last3 = Konings| first3 = P. | last4 = McRae | first4 = I. | last5 = Girosi | first5 = F. |year = 2014 | title = A brief report on Primary Care Service Area catchment geographies in New South Wales Australia.| url = https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-072X-13-38| journal = International Journal of Health Geographics| volume = 13 | issue =38 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1476-072X-13-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; United States &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = D. | last2 = Mick| first2 = S. | last3 = Bott | first3 = D. | last4 = Stukel | first4 = T. | last5 = Chang | first5 = CH. | last6 = Marth | first6 = N. | last7 = Boag | first7 = J. | last8 = Carretta | first8 = HJ. |year = 2003 | title = Primary care service areas: a new tool for the evaluation of primary care services.| pmid = 12650392 | journal = Health Serv Res| volume = 38 | issue =1 | pages = 287–309 | doi = 10.1111/1475-6773.00116 | pmc=1360885}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Switzerland &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Busato | first1 = A. | last2 = Kunzi| first2 = B.|year = 2008 | title = Primary care physician supply and other key determinants of health care utilisation: the case of Switzerland.| url = http://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1472-6963-8-8 | journal = BMC Health Services Research | volume = 8 | issue =1 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-8-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; using [[big data]] and [[Geographic information systems]]. In Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mazumdar | first1 = S. | last2 = Feng| first2 = X. | last3 = Konings| first3 = P. | last4 = McRae | first4 = I. | last5 = Girosi | first5 = F. |year = 2014 | title = A brief report on Primary Care Service Area catchment geographies in New South Wales Australia.| url = https://ij-healthgeographics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1476-072X-13-38| journal = International Journal of Health Geographics| volume = 13 | issue =38 | pages = 1–8 | doi = 10.1186/1476-072X-13-38}}&lt;/ref&gt; while they have been developed for the state of New South Wales, they have not found application among policymakers, where, as of 2016 much larger geographies called Primary Health Networks are used for primary care management. However, they have found an especially wide audience amongst policymakers and researchers in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = D. | last2 = Mick| first2 = S. | last3 = Bott | first3 = D. | last4 = Stukel | first4 = T. | last5 = Chang | first5 = CH. | last6 = Marth | first6 = N. | last7 = Boag | first7 = J. | last8 = Carretta | first8 = HJ. |year = 2003 | title = Primary care service areas: a new tool for the evaluation of primary care services.| pmid = 12650392 | journal = Health Serv Res| volume = 38 | issue =1 | pages = 287–309 | doi = 10.1111/1475-6773.00116 | pmc=1360885}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where they were first developed. Thus for example the Health Resources and Services Administration uses them to designate areas of workforce shortage. Primary Care Service Areas are thus for example an appropriate geography for measuring  primary care [[physician supply]] or geographic access to [[General practitioners]].

'''Project Pericles''' Inc. is a [[non-profit]] organization composed of [[liberal arts college]]s and universities geared towards the ideas that social responsibility and participatory citizenship are essential parts of an [[undergraduate]] curriculum, in the classroom, on campus, and in the community.

==Background==
Conceived by [[Eugene M. Lang]], a retired businessman known for his educational philanthropy, Project Pericles seeks to counter the growing political cynicism and civic disengagement of young people. Convinced that higher education must promote social and civic engagement, in 1999 Lang organized a planning committee and consulted with college presidents, trustees, faculty, students, and others. By the end of 2000, the objectives, policies, and startup plans of Project Pericles were set. Ten colleges and universities became “founding Pericleans.”   

The Boards of the Pericleans formally committed their institutions to the policies and objectives of Project Pericles. Their presidents formed a Presidents’ Council to cooperate in policy-making and program development and implementation. The planning committee became the Board of Directors. Distinguished educational, business, political, and community leaders became the National Board of Advisors. 

In April 2003, the first ten Pericleans met in New York for the first national conference of Project Pericles. Delegates included presidents, provosts, deans, faculty, students, and alumni. In August 2003, Project Pericles established an independent office and hired Karen E. Holt as Executive Director. In November 2005, Jan R. Liss became its second Executive Director.

In 2004 and 2005, a select group of new Pericleans added to the diversity of Project Pericles. The spirit of Pericleans and cumulative experience continue to strengthen Project Pericles in its mission as a transforming force for higher education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14289">'''Regenerative design''' is a process-oriented [[Systems theory|whole systems]] approach to [[Design thinking|design]]. The term "regenerative" describes processes that restore, renew or revitalize their own sources of energy and materials. Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] and equitable systems that integrate the needs of [[society]] with the integrity of nature. 

Designers use [[Systems theory|systems thinking]], applied [[Permaculture|permaculture design]] principles, and [[community development]] processes to design human and [[ecological]] systems. The development of regenerative design has been influenced by approaches found in the [[biomimicry]], [[biophilic design]], [[Ecological economics|ecological economics,]] [[Circular economy|circular economics]]. As well as [[Social movement|social movements]] such as permaculture, [[Transition town|transition]] and the [[new economy]]. Regenerative design can also refer to process of designing systems such as [[restorative justice]], [[Rewilding (conservation biology)|rewilding]] and [[regenerative agriculture]].
[[File:Feedback loop.png|thumb|Feedback loop used in regenerative design]]
A new generation of designers are applying ecologically inspired design to [[agriculture]], architecture, [[community planning]], [[Sustainable urban planning|cities]], [[wikt:enterprise|enterprise]]s, [[economics]] and [[Systems ecology|ecosystem regeneration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.permaculture.co.uk/articles/designing-regenerative-cultures|title=Permaculture magazine|date=2016-06-18|work=Permaculture magazine|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many designers use the resilient models observed in [[systems ecology]] in their design process and recognize that [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] are [[Ecological resilience|resilient]] largely because they operate in [[closed ecological system|closed loop systems.]] Using this model regenerative design seeks feedback at every stage of the design process. [[Feedback]] loops are an integral to regenerative systems as understood by processes used in [[Restorative practices|restorative practice]] and [[community development]].

Regenerative design is interconnected with the approaches of systems thinking and with [[New Economy Coalition#New Economy movement|New Economy movement]]. The 'new economy' considers that the current economic system needs to be restructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Diebold|first=William|last2=Alperovitz|first2=Gar|last3=Faux|first3=Jeff|date=1984|title=Rebuilding America: A Blueprint for the New Economy|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/20042109|journal=Foreign Affairs|volume=63|issue=1|pages=190|doi=10.2307/20042109|issn=0015-7120}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on the assumption that people and the planet should come first, and that it is human well-being, not economic growth, which should be prioritized. 

Whereas the highest aim of [[sustainable development]] is to satisfy [[fundamental human needs]] today without compromising the possibility of future generations to satisfy theirs, the goal of regenerative design is to develop restorative systems that are dynamic and emergent, and are beneficial for humans and other species. This regeneration process is participatory, iterative and individual to the community and environment it is applied to. This process intends to revitalize communities, human and natural resources, and for some, society as a whole. 

In recent years regenerative design is made possible on a larger scale using open source socio- technicle platforms and technological systems as used in [[Smart city|SMART cities]]. It is an includes community and city development processes like gathering [[feedback]], [[Participatory democracy|participatory governance]], [[sortition]] and [[participatory budgeting]].

== History ==
During the late 1970s, [[John T. Lyle]] (1934–1998), a [[landscape architecture]] professor, challenged graduate students to envision a community in which daily activities were based on the value of living within the limits of available [[Renewable resource|renewable resources]] without [[environmental degradation]]. Over the next few decades an eclectic group of students, professors and experts from around the world and crossing many disciplines developed designs for an institute to be built at [[Cal Poly Pomona]]. In 1992 the [[Lyle Center for Regenerative Studies]] was built over two years and opened in 1994. In that same year Lyle's book ''Regenerative Design for Sustainable Development'' was published by [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]]. In 1995 Lyle worked with [[William McDonough]] at [[Oberlin College]] for the [[Adam Joseph Lewis Center for Environmental Studies]] completed in 2000. In 2002 McDonough's book, the more popular and successful, ''[[Cradle to Cradle: Remaking the Way We Make Things]]'' was published reiterating the concepts developed by Lyle.

Lyle saw the connection between concepts developed by [[Robert Rodale|Bob Rodale]] of the [[Rodale Institute]] for [[regenerative agriculture]] and the opportunity to develop regenerative systems for all other aspects of the world. While regenerative agriculture focused solely on agriculture, Lyle expanded its concepts and use to all systems. With regenerative agriculture, the concepts are very straight forward and simple but Lyle understood that when developing for other types of systems, more complicated ideas such as [[entropy]] and [[embodied energy|emergy]] must be taken into consideration.

Swiss architect [[Walter R. Stahel]] developed approaches entirely similar to Lyle's also in the late 1970s but instead coined the term [[cradle-to-cradle design]] made popular by McDonough and [[Michael Braungart]]

Whilst in 1974 [[David Holmgren]] and [[Bill Mollison]] first started working together to develop the theory and practice of [[permaculture]]. They met when Mollison spoke at a seminar at the Department of Environmental Design and began to work together. During their first three years together Mollison worked at applying their ideas, and Holmgren wrote the manuscript for what would become ''Permaculture One: a perennial agricultural system for human settlements'' as he completed his Environmental Design studies, and submitted it as the major reference for his thesis. He then handed the manuscript to Mollison for editing and additions, before it was published in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dargavel|first=John|last2=Mulligan|first2=Martin|last3=Hill|first3=Stuart|date=July 2003|title=Ecological Pioneers: A Social History of Australian Ecological Thought and Action|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3986208|journal=Environmental History|volume=8|issue=3|pages=481|doi=10.2307/3986208|issn=1084-5453}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term permaculture was developed and coined by [[David Holmgren]], then a graduate student at the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education's Department of Environmental Design, and [[Bill Mollison]], senior lecturer in Environmental Psychology at University of Tasmania, in 1978. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''permaculture'' originally referred to "permanent agriculture",{{Sfn|King|1911}}&lt;ref&gt;Paull , John (2011) [https://www.academia.edu/9148622/The_making_of_an_agricultural_classic_Farmers_of_Forty_Centuries_or_Permanent_Agriculture_in_China_Korea_and_Japan_1911-2011 The making of an agricultural classic: Farmers of Forty Centuries or Permanent Agriculture in China, Korea and Japan, 1911-2011], Agricultural Sciences, 2 (3), pp. 175-180.&lt;/ref&gt; but was expanded to stand also for "permanent culture", as it was understood that social aspects were integral to a truly sustainable system as inspired by [[Masanobu Fukuoka]]’s [[natural farming]] philosophy. Regenerative design is integral to permaculture design.

== Regenerative versus sustainable ==
[[regeneration (ecology)|Regenerative]] and [[sustainable]] are essentially the same thing except for one key point: in a sustainable system, lost [[ecological system]]s are not returned to existence. In a regenerative system, those lost systems can ultimately begin "regenerating" back into existence. Put more simply regenerative systems work using regenerative feedback loops that allows for [[adaptability]], dynamism and [[emergence]] to create and develop resilient systems than the idea that we need to a sustain the world the way we (humans) found it, now and into the future.

There is also a linguistic problem with the word "sustainable", which in the strict sense is meant to mean "[[self-sustaining]]". Because the word root "sustain" means "last" or "endure," the general public and even many non-experts in the industry define the word only as "able to last" or "the capacity to endure." In popular usage by designers and product manufacturers, "sustainable" has become a relative term referring to any material, process or product (including a building) which is less toxic or environmental harmful than those conventionally used.  A product that contains 75% [[recycled]] material is often considered "sustainable", but is in fact merely MORE sustainable than a comparable product that contains no recycled material.  A truly sustainable material would be one made of 100% recycled material that can, in turn, be completely recycled into a comparable new material or product.  This is rarely the case.

"Regenerative" also suffers from a slightly different linguistic problem, the term is still competing with the biological community in terms of its use for the [[regeneration (biology)|re-growth]] of limbs etc.. However once the word itself gains wide usage, its meaning becomes more general, much like in the case of the term "sustainable". The base meaning of "re-generative" means the "capacity to bring into existence again." So if an item or system is regenerative the item or system has the capacity to bring itself into existence again. Using the example above, a truly regenerative product would not only be 100% recycled and recyclable, but it would also improve the environmental conditions at the factory where it was made, the business where it was used and so on throughout its life-cycle (creating habitat, filtering water, catalyzing [[nitrogen-fixation]] processes in the soil, etc.).

== Preservation versus conservation ==
Regenerative design places more importance on conservation and biodiversity rather than on preservation. It is recognized in regenerative design that humans are a part of natural ecosystems. To exclude people is to create dense areas that destroy pockets of existing ecosystems while preserving pockets of ecosystems without allowing them to change naturally over time. By incorporating people into ecosystems all inputs are pulled from local areas and all outputs are accounted for creating a waste-less system. 

== Food systems and business ==
Regenerative farming or '[[regenerative agriculture]]' calls for the creation of demand on agricultural systems to produce food in a way that is beneficial to the production and the ecology of the environment. It uses the [[science]] of [[systems ecology]], and the design and application through [[permaculture]]. As understanding of its benefits to human biology and ecological systems that sustain us is increased as has the demand for [[organic food]]. Organic food grown using regenerative and permaculture design increases the [[biodiversity]] and is used to develop business models that regenerate communities. Whereas some foods are organic some are not strictly regenerative because it is not clearly seeking to maximize biodiversity and the resilience of the environment and the workforce. Regenerative agriculture grows organic produce through [[Corporate social responsibility|ethical supply chains]], [[zero waste]] policies, [[Living wage|fair wages]], [[staff development]] and [[Wellbeing at Work conference|wellbeing]], and in some cases [[cooperative]] and [[social enterprise]] models. It seeks to benefit the staff along the [[supply chain]], customers, and ecosystems with the outcome of human and [[Restoration ecology|ecological restoration]] and regeneration.

== Size of regenerative systems ==
The size of the regenerative system effects the [[complexity]] of the design process. The smaller a [[system]] is designed the more likely it is to be resilient and regenerative. Multiple small regenerative systems that are put together to create larger regenerative systems help to create supplies for multiple human-inclusive-ecological systems.

The [[Baltimore]]-based '''Research Institute for Advanced Studies (RIAS)''', not to be confused with the better-known [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, New Jersey, was among the several centers for research in the mathematical and physical sciences established throughout the United States after World War II, in recognition of the critical role that fundamental scientific research played in the outcome of that war. Although not as well known as other similar institutes, such as the IAS mentioned above, or the [[RAND Corporation]], it nevertheless made significant contributions to the sciences of systems and control theory, and various branches of mathematics, during its 18-year existence.&lt;ref&gt;Talbert, E, Conquest of Gravity Aim of Top Scientists in U.S., ''New York Harold Tribune'', (November 20, 1955), pp. 1, 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Research Institute for Advanced Studies (sometimes referred to in the singular) was founded in 1955 by George Bunker of the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]], the ancestor of the aerospace giant [[Lockheed Martin]]. Its founding was the idea of George Bunker, who took over from Glenn Martin as chairman of that company in 1952. Like the leaders of other aircraft companies in the United States, Bunker recognized that the future of aviation lay in applying new ideas of fundamental research in mathematics, electronics, and physics that had been developed during World War II. Bunker established the Institute in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, specifically chartered to support fundamental research. The RIAS's first Director was Welcome W. Bender.&lt;ref name=Harwood&gt;William B. Harwood, ''Raise Heaven and Earth: The Story of Martin-Marietta People and Their Pioneering Achievements'', (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1993), pp. 283-284.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute distinguished itself as one of the world's leading centers of mathematical research, especially in [[Control theory|control]] and [[systems theory]]. Among the mathematicians on its staff were [[Solomon Lefschetz]] and [[Rudolf E. Kálmán]] (who while at the Institute in 1960 published a famous paper that was the basis for the "[[Kalman Filter]]," a technique for extracting information from a noisy channel that finds applications in many facets of modern life), as well as [[Joseph P. LaSalle]] (who in 1960 published a paper describing [[LaSalle's invariance principle]]), [[Jack K. Hale]], [[Harold J. Kushner]] and others. While at RIAS in the early 1960s, [[Rod Driver|Rodney Driver]] undertook research on [[delay differential equation]]s and their applications.

The RIAS changed its name and turned its mission away from basic research in 1973, after the merger that produced the [[Martin Marietta]] Corporation.&lt;ref name=Harwood /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martin Marietta Corporation Site|url=http://www.mde.state.md.us/assets/document/brownfields/Martin_Marietta_corp.pdf|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''SaltMod''' is [[computer program]] for the prediction of the [[salinity]] of [[soil moisture]], [[groundwater]] and [[drainage]] water, the depth of the [[watertable]], and the drain [[discharge (hydrology)]] in [[irrigation|irrigated]] [[agriculture|agricultural]] lands, using different [[geohydrology|(geo)hydrologic]] conditions, varying [[water management]] options, including the use of ground water for irrigation, and several [[crop rotation|cropping rotation]] schedules.
The water management options include irrigation, drainage, and the use of subsurface drainage water from pipe drains, ditches or [[Water well|wells]] for irrigation.

==Soil salinity models==
The majority of the computer models available for water and solute transport in the soil (e.g. Swatre,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.alterra.wur.nl/Internet/webdocs/ilri-publicaties/publicaties/Pub55/pub55-h4.pdf Swatre]&lt;/ref&gt; DrainMod &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/wetdrain/wetdrain-tools.html Drainmod] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623100817/http://www.wcc.nrcs.usda.gov/wetdrain/wetdrain-tools.html |date=2007-06-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ) are based on Richard's [[differential equation]] for the movement of water in [[Vadose zone|unsaturated]] soil in combination with a differential salinity [[dispersion equation]]. The models require input of soil characteristics like the relation between unsaturated soil moisture content, water tension, [[hydraulic conductivity]] and dispersivity.

These relations vary to a great extent from place to place and are not easy to measure. The models use short time steps and need at least a daily data base of hydrological phenomena. Altogether this makes model application to a fairly large project the job of a team of specialists with ample facilities.

==Rationale==
There is a need for a computer program that is easier to operate and that requires a simpler [[data structure]] than most currently available models. Therefore, the SaltModod program was designed keeping in mind a relative simplicity of operation to facilitate the use by field technicians, engineers and project planners instead of specialized [[geohydrology|geo-hydrologists]].

It aims at using input data that are generally available, or that can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, or that can be measured with relative ease. Although the calculations are done numerically and have to be repeated many times, the final results can be ''checked by hand'' using the formulas in the manual.

SaltMod's objective is to predict the long-term hydro-salinity in terms of general [[wikt:trend|trend]]s, not to arrive at exact predictions of how, for example, the situation would be on the first of April in ten years from now.

Further, SaltMod gives the option of the re-use of drainage and well water (e.g. for irrigation) and it can account for farmers' response to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]], [[soil salinity]], water scarcity and over-pumping from the [[aquifer]]. Also it offers the possibility to introduce [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage systems]] at varying depths and with varying capacity so that they can be [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimized]].
Other features of Saltmod are found in the next section.

==Principles==
===Seasonal approach===
The computation method Saltmod is based on seasonal [[water balance]]s of agricultural lands. Four seasons in one year can be distinguished, e.g. dry, wet, cold, hot, irrigation or [[fallow]] seasons. The number of seasons (Ns) can be chosen between a minimum of one and a maximum of four. The larger the number of seasons becomes, the larger is the number of input data required. The duration of each season (Ts) is given in number of months (0 &lt; Ts &lt; 12). Day to day water balances are not considered for several reasons:
#daily inputs would require much information, which may not be readily available;
#the method is especially developed to predict long term, not day-to-day, trends and predictions for the future are more reliably made on a seasonal (long term) than on a daily (short term) basis, due to the high variability of short-term data;
#even though the precision of the predictions for the future may still not be very high, a lot is gained when the trend is sufficiently clear; for example, it need not be a major constraint to design appropriate [[soil salinity control]] measures when a certain salinity level, predicted by Saltmod to occur after 20 years, will in reality occur after 15 or 25 years.

===Hydrological data===
The method uses seasonal water balance components as input data. These are related to the surface [[hydrology]] (like [[rainfall]], [[evaporation]], irrigation, use of drain and well water for irrigation, [[Surface runoff|runoff]]), and the [[aquifer]] [[hydrology]] (like upward seepage, natural drainage, pumping from wells). The other water balance components (like downward [[percolation]], upward [[capillary rise]], [[Drainage system (agriculture)|subsurface drainage]]) are given as output.&lt;br&gt;
The quantity of drainage water, as an output, is determined by two drainage intensity factors for drainage above and below drain level respectively (to be given with the input data), a drainage reduction factor (to simulate a limited operation of the drainage system), and the height of the water table, resulting from the computed water balance. Variation of the drainage intensity factors and the drainage reduction factor gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different drainage options.

===Agricultural data===
[[File:Riego por surcos.JPG|thumb|250px|Irrigated land]]
The input data on [[irrigation]], [[evaporation]], and surface [[Surface runoff|runoff]] are to be specified per [[season]] for three kinds of agricultural practices, which can be chosen at the discretion of the user: 
#A:	irrigated land with crops of group A
#B:	irrigated land with crops of group B
#U:	non-irrigated land with rainfed crops or fallow land
The groups, expressed in fractions of the total area, may consist of combinations of [[crop]]s or just of a single kind of crop. For example, as the A type crops one may specify the lightly irrigated cultures, and as the B type the more heavily irrigated ones, such as [[sugarcane]] and [[rice]]. But one can also take A as rice and B as sugarcane, or perhaps [[tree]]s and [[orchard]]s. The A, B and/or U crops can be taken differently in different [[season]]s, e.g. A=[[wheat]]+[[barley]] in winter and A=[[maize]] in summer while B=[[vegetable]]s in winter and B=[[cotton]] in summer.&lt;br&gt; 
	Un-irrigated land can be specified in two ways: (1) as U=1&amp;minus;A&amp;minus;B and (2) as A and/or B with zero irrigation. A combination can also be made.&lt;br&gt;
	Further, a specification must be given of the seasonal [[crop rotation|rotation]] of the different [[land use]]s over the total area, e.g. full rotation, no rotation at all, or incomplete rotation.  This occurs with a rotation index. The rotations are taken over the seasons within the year. To obtain rotations over the years it is advisable to introduce annual input changes.&lt;br&gt;
	When a fraction A1, B1 and/or U1 in the first season differs from fractions are A2, B2 and/or U2 in the second season, because the irrigation regimes in the seasons differ, the program will detect that a certain rotation occurs. If one wishes to avoid this, one may specify the same fractions in all seasons (A2=A1, B2=B1, U2=U1), but the crops and irrigation quantities may have to be adjusted in proportion.&lt;br&gt;
	Cropping rotation schedules vary widely in different parts of the world. Creative combinations of area fractions, rotation indexes, irrigation quantities and annual input changes can accommodate many types of agricultural practices.
	Variation of the area fractions and/or the rotational schedule gives the opportunity to simulate the effect of different agricultural practices on the water and salt balance.

===Soil strata===
[[File:Aquifer en.svg|thumb|250px|The aquifer can play an important role in soil salinity]]
Saltmod accepts four different reservoirs, three of which are in the soil profile:
#	a surface reservoir
#	an upper (shallow) soil reservoir or root zone
#	an intermediate soil reservoir or transition zone
#	a deep reservoir or [[aquifer]].
The upper soil reservoir is defined by the soil depth from which water can evaporate or be taken up by plant roots. It can be equal to the rootzone.&lt;br&gt;
The root zone can be saturated, [[Vadose zone|unsaturated]], or partly saturated, depending on the [[water balance]]. All water movements in this zone are vertical, either upward or downward, depending on the water balance. (In a future version of Saltmod, the upper soil reservoir may be divided into two equal parts to detect the trend in the vertical salinity distribution.)&lt;br&gt;
The transition zone can also be saturated, unsaturated or partly saturated. All flows in this zone are vertical, except the flow to subsurface drains.&lt;br&gt;
If a horizontal subsurface [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]] is present, this must be placed in the transition zone, which is then divided into two parts: an upper transition zone (above drain level) and a lower transition zone (below drain level).&lt;br&gt;
If one wishes to distinguish an upper and lower part of the transition zone in the absence of a subsurface drainage system, one may specify in the input data a drainage system with zero intensity.&lt;br&gt;
The aquifer has mainly horizontal flow. Pumped wells, if present, receive their water from the aquifer only.

===Water balances===
[[Image:SoilLeaching2.jpg|thumb|250px|Water balance factors in the top soil]]
The [[water balance]]s are calculated for each reservoir separately as shown in the article [[Hydrology (agriculture)]]. The excess water leaving one reservoir is converted into incoming water for the next reservoir.&lt;br&gt;
The three soil reservoirs can be assigned a different thickness and storage coefficients, to be given as input data.&lt;br&gt;
In a particular situation, the transition zone or the aquifer need not be present. Then, it must be given a minimum thickness of 0.1 m.&lt;br&gt;
The depth of the [[water table]], calculated from the water balances, is assumed to be the same for the whole area. If this assumption is not acceptable, the area must be divided into separate units.&lt;br&gt;
Under certain conditions, the height of the water table influences the water balance components. For example a rise of the water table towards the soil surface may lead to an increase of [[evaporation]], surface [[Surface runoff|runoff]], and subsurface drainage, or a decrease of [[percolation]] losses from canals. This, in turn, leads to a change of the water balance, which again influences the height of the water table, etc.&lt;br&gt;
This chain of reactions is one of the reasons why Saltmod has been developed into a computer program. It takes a number of repeated calculations ([[iterations]]) to find the correct equilibrium of the water balance, which would be a tedious job if done by hand. Other reasons are that a computer program facilitates the computations for different water management options over long periods of time (with the aim to simulate their long-term effects) and for trial runs with varying parameters.

===Drains, wells, and re-use===
The [[Drainage system (agriculture)|sub-surface drainage]] can be accomplished through [[Tile drainage|drains]] or pumped [[Water well|wells]].&lt;br&gt;
The subsurface drains are characterized by drain depth and ''drainage capacity factor ''. The drains are located in the transition zone. The subsurface drainage facility can be applied to natural or artificial drainage systems. The functioning of an artificial drainage system can be regulated through a ''drainage control factor''.&lt;br&gt;
When no drainage system is present, installing drains with zero capacity offers the opportunity to obtain separate water and salt balances for an upper and lower part of the transition zone.&lt;br&gt;
The pumped wells are located in the aquifer. Their functioning is characterized by the well discharge.&lt;br&gt;
The drain and well water can be used for irrigation through a ''re-use factor''. This may affect the salt balance and the irrigation efficiency or sufficiency.
[[Image:SALTMOD4.JPG|thumb|200px|Leaching curves, calibrating leaching efficiency]]

===Salt balances===
The [[Soil salinity control|salt balances]] are calculated for each reservoir separately. They are based on their [[water balance]]s, using the ''salt concentrations'' of the incoming and outgoing water. Some concentrations must be given as input data, like the initial salt concentrations of the water in the different soil reservoirs, of the irrigation water and of the incoming ground water in the aquifer.


[[File:Saltleaching.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Graphic presentation of soil salinity trends]]
The concentrations are expressed in terms of [[electric conductivity]] (EC in dS/m). When the concentrations are known in terms of g salt/l water, the rule of thumb: 1 g/l -&gt; 1.7 dS/m can be used. Usually, salt concentrations of the soil are expressed in ECe, the electric conductivity of an extract of a saturated soil paste (saturation extract). In Saltmod, the salt concentration is expressed as the EC of the soil moisture when saturated under field conditions. As a rule, one can use the conversion rate EC : ECe = 2 : 1.&lt;br&gt;
Salt concentrations of outgoing water (either from one reservoir into the other or by subsurface drainage) are computed on the basis of salt balances, using different ''leaching or salt mixing efficiencies'' to be given with the input data. The effects of different [[Leaching model#Leaching efficiency|leaching efficiencies]] can be simulated by varying their input value.


If drain or well water is used for irrigation, the method computes the salt concentration of the mixed irrigation water in the course of the time and the subsequent effect on the soil and ground water salinities, which again influences the salt concentration of the drain and well water. By varying the fraction of used drain or well water (to be given in the input data), the long-term effect of different fractions can be simulated.


The [[solvation|dissolution]] of solid soil minerals or the chemical [[precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] of poorly soluble salts is not included in the computation method, but to some extent it can be accounted for through the input data, e.g. by increasing or decreasing the salt concentration of the irrigation water or of the incoming water in the aquifer.

===Farmers' responses===
If required, farmers' responses to [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|water logging]] and [[soil salinity]] can be automatically accounted for. The method can gradually decrease:
#	the amount of irrigation water applied when the [[water table]] becomes shallower;
#	the fraction of irrigated land when the available irrigation water is scarce;
#	the fraction of irrigated land when the soil salinity increases; for this purpose, the salinity is given a [[stochastic]] interpretation.
Response (1) is different for ponded (submerged) [[rice]] (paddy) and "dry foot" crops.


The responses influence the water and salt balances, which, in their turn, slow down the process of water logging and salinization. Ultimately an equilibrium situation will be brought about.


The user can also introduce farmers' responses by manually changing the relevant input data. Perhaps it will be useful first to study the automatic farmers' responses and their effect and thereafter decide what the farmers' responses will be in the view of the user.

===Annual input changes===
The program may run with fixed input data for the number of years determined by the user. This option can be used to predict future developments based on long-term average input values, e.g. rainfall, as it will be difficult to assess the future values of the input data year by year.
The program also offers the possibility to follow historic records with annually changing input values (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, agricultural practices), the calculations must be made year by year. If this possibility is chosen, the program creates transfer files by which the final conditions of the previous year (e.g. water table and salinity) are automatically used as the initial conditions for the subsequent period. This facility makes it possible to use various generated rainfall sequences drawn [[random]]ly from a known rainfall [[probability distribution]] and obtain a [[stochastic]] prediction of the resulting output parameters.


If the computations are made with annual changes, not all input parameters can be changed, notably the thickness of the soil reservoirs and their total porosities as these would cause illogical shifts in the water and salt balances.

===Output data===
The output of Saltmod is given for each season of any year during any number of years, as specified with the input data. The output data comprise hydrological and salinity aspects.

The data are filed in the form of tables that can be inspected directly or further analyzed with [[spreadsheet]] programs.

As the soil salinity is very variable from place to place (figure left) SaltMod includes frequency distributions in the output. The figure was made with the CumFreq program [http://www.waterlog.info/cumfreq.htm] .
 
The program offers the possibility to develop a multitude of relations between varied input data, resulting outputs and time.&lt;br&gt; 
However, as it is not possible to foresee all different uses that may be made, the program offers only a limited number of standard [[graphics]].
 
The program is designed to make use of spreadsheet programs for the detailed output analysis, in which the relations between various input and output variables can be established according to the scenario developed by the user.

Although the [[computations]] need many [[iterations]], all the end results can be ''checked by hand'' using the equations presented in the manual.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47754">'''Selective exposure''' is a theory within the practice of [[psychology]], often used in media and [[communication]] research, that historically refers to individuals' tendency to favor information which reinforces their pre-existing views while avoiding [[contradictory]] information. Selective exposure has also been known and defined as "congeniality bias" or "[[confirmation bias]]" in various texts throughout the years.&lt;ref name="Hart2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=William|last2=Albarracín|first2=Dolores|last3=Eagly|first3=Alice H.|last4=Brechan|first4=Inge|last5=Lindberg|first5=Matthew J.|last6=Merrill|first6=Lisa|title=Feeling validated versus being correct: A meta-analysis of selective exposure to information.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2009|volume=135|issue=4|pages=555–588|doi=10.1037/a0015701|pmid=19586162|pmc=4797953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the historical use of the term, people tend to select specific aspects of exposed information which they incorporate into their mindset. These selections are made based on their perspectives, beliefs, attitudes and decisions.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2009"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Sullivan|editor-first=Larry E.|title=The SAGE Glossary of the Social and Behavioral Sciences|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0YE3C4HMnsoC|year=2009|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-5143-2|page=465|chapter=Selective Exposure}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can mentally dissect the information they are exposed to and select favorable evidence, while ignoring the unfavorable. The foundation of this theory is rooted in the [[cognitive dissonance theory]], which asserts that when individuals are confronted with contrasting ideas, certain mental [[defense mechanism]]s are activated to produce harmony between new ideas and pre-existing beliefs, which results in cognitive equilibrium. Cognitive equilibrium, which is defined as a state of balance between a person's mental representation of the world and his or her environment, is crucial to understanding selective exposure theory. According to [[Jean Piaget]], when a mismatch occurs, people find it to be  "inherently dissatisfying".&lt;ref name="Beauchamp2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beauchamp|first1=Anne S.|chapter=Cognitive equilibrium|editor-last=Salkind|editor-first=Neil J.|title=Encyclopedia of Human Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPxyAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT323|year=2005|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6539-1|pages=281–282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Selective exposure relies on the assumption that one will continue to seek out information on an issue even after an individual has taken a stance on it. The position that a person has taken will be colored by various factors of that issue that are reinforced during the [[decision-making process]].

Selective exposure has been displayed in various contexts such as self-serving situations and situations in which people hold [[prejudice]]s regarding [[Ingroups and outgroups|outgroups]], particular opinions, and personal and group-related issues.&lt;ref name="KastenmullerGreitemeyer2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kastenmüller|first1=Andreas|last2=Greitemeyer|first2=Tobias|last3=Jonas|first3=Eva|last4=Fischer|first4=Peter|last5=Frey|first5=Dieter|title=Selective exposure: The impact of collectivism and individualism|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=49|issue=4|year=2010|pages=745–763|doi=10.1348/014466609X478988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceived usefulness of information, perceived norm of fairness, and curiosity of valuable information are three factors that can counteract selective exposure.

== Effect on decision-making ==

=== Individual versus group decision-making ===
[[File:My Wife and My Mother-in-Law.jpg|thumbnail|left|This image, which can be seen as a young woman or an older woman, serves as an example of how individuals can choose to perceive the same image differently. According to Selective Exposure Theory, people tend to seek out the version of a stimulant that they want to be exposed to, such as a form of the stimulant that they are already familiar with.]]
Selective exposure can affect the decisions people make as individuals or as groups because they may be unwilling to change their views and beliefs either collectively or on their own. A historical example of the disastrous effects of selective exposure and its effects on group dynamics is the series of events leading up to the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] in 1961. [[President John F. Kennedy]] was given the go ahead by his advisers to authorize the invasion of Cuba by poorly trained expatriates despite overwhelming evidence that it was a foolish and ill-conceived tactical maneuver. The advisers were so eager to please the President that they confirmed their cognitive bias for the invasion rather than challenging the faulty plan.&lt;ref name="Kastenmuller2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kastenmüller|first1=Andreas|last2=Greitemeyer|first2=Tobias|last3=Zehl|first3=Stefanie|last4=Tattersall|first4=Andrew J.|last5=George|first5=Helen|last6=Frey|first6=Dieter|last7=Fischer|first7=Peter|title=Leadership and Information Processing: The influence of transformational and transactional leadership on selective information search, evaluation, and conveying.|journal=Social Psychology|date=2014|volume=45|issue=5|pages=357–370|doi=10.1027/1864-9335/a000177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changing beliefs about one's self, other people, and the world are three variables as to why people fear new information.&lt;ref name=Sweeny2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweeny|first1=Kate|last2=Melnyk|first2=Darya|last3=Miller|first3=Wendi|last4=Shepperd|first4=James A.|title=Information avoidance: Who, what, when, and why.|journal=Review of General Psychology|volume=14|issue=4|year=2010|pages=340–353|doi=10.1037/a0021288}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of studies has shown that selective exposure effects can occur in the context of both individual and group decision making.&lt;ref name=Jonas2001&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonas|first1=Eva|last2=Schulz-Hardt|first2=Stefan|last3=Frey|first3=Dieter|last4=Thelen|first4=Norman|title=Confirmation bias in sequential information search after preliminary decisions: An expansion of dissonance theoretical research on selective exposure to information.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=80|issue=4|year=2001|pages=557–571|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.4.557}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous situational variables have been identified that increase the tendency toward selective exposure.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Fischer|first2=Julia K.|last3=Aydin|first3=Nilüfer|last4=Frey|first4=Dieter|title=Physically Attractive Social Information Sources Lead to Increased Selective Exposure to Information|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=32|issue=4|year=2010|pages=340–347|doi=10.1080/01973533.2010.519208}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social psychology]], specifically, includes research with a variety of situational factors and related psychological processes that eventually persuade a person to make a quality decision. Additionally, from a psychological perspective, the effects of selective exposure can both stem from motivational and cognitive accounts.

=== Effect of information quantity===

According to research study by Fischer, Schulz-Hardt, et al. (2008), the quantity of decision-relevant information that the participants were exposed to had a significant effect on their levels of selective exposure. A group for which only two pieces of decision-relevant information were given had experienced lower levels of selective exposure than the other group who had ten pieces of information to evaluate. This research brought more attention to the cognitive processes of individuals when they are presented with a very small amount of decision-consistent and decision-inconsistent information. The study showed that in situations such as this, an individual becomes more doubtful of their initial decision due to the unavailability of resources. They begin to think that there is not enough data or evidence in this particular field in which they are told to make a decision about. Because of this, the subject becomes more critical of their initial thought process and focuses on both decision-consistent and inconsistent sources, thus decreasing his level of selective exposure. For the group who had plentiful pieces of information, this factor made them confident in their initial decision because they felt comfort from the fact that their decision topic was well-supported by a large number of resources.&lt;ref name="Krueger, J. I. 2012"&gt;Krueger, J. I. (Ed.). (2012). ''Social judgment and decision making.'' New York, NY: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the availability of decision-relevant and irrelevant information surrounding individuals can influence the level of selective exposure experienced during the process of decision-making.

Selective exposure is prevalent within singular individuals and groups of people and can influence either to reject new ideas or information that is not commensurate with the original ideal.  In Jonas et al. (2001) empirical studies were done on four different experiments investigating individuals' and groups' decision making. This article suggests that [[confirmation bias]] is prevalent in decision making. Those who find new information often draw their attention towards areas where they hold personal attachment. Thus, people are driven toward pieces of information that are coherent with their own expectations or beliefs as a result of this selective exposure theory occurring in action. Throughout the process of the four experiments, generalization is always considered valid and confirmation bias is always present when seeking new information and making decisions.&lt;ref name=Jonas2001 /&gt;

=== Accuracy motivation and defense motivation ===

Fischer and Greitemeyer (2010) explored individuals' decision making in terms of selective exposure to confirmatory information.&lt;ref name=FischerKastenmuller2011&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Kastenmüller|first2=Andreas| last3=Greitemeyer|first3=Tobias|last4=Fischer|first4=Julia|last5=Frey|first5=Dieter|last6=Crelley|first6=David|title=Threat and selective exposure: The moderating role of threat and decision context on confirmatory information search after decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: General|volume=140|issue=1|year=2011|pages=51–62|doi=10.1037/a0021595}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selective exposure posed that individuals make their decisions based on information that is consistent with their decision rather than information that is inconsistent.  Recent research has shown that "Confirmatory Information Search" was responsible for the 2008 bankruptcy of the [[Lehman Brothers]] Investment Bank which then triggered the [[Global Financial Crisis]].  In the zeal for profit and economic gain, politicians, investors and financial advisors ignored the mathematical evidence that foretold the housing market crash in favor of flimsy justifications for upholding the status quo.&lt;ref name="FischerKastenmuller2011" /&gt; Researchers explain that subjects have the tendency to seek and select information using their integrative model. There are two primary motivations for selective exposure: Accuracy Motivation and Defense Motivation. Accuracy Motivation explains that an individual is motivated to be accurate in their decision making and Defense Motivation explains that one seeks confirmatory information to support their beliefs and justify their decisions. Accuracy motivation is not always beneficial within the context of selective exposure and can instead be counterintuitive, increasing the amount of selective exposure. Defense motivation can lead to reduced levels of selective exposure.&lt;ref name=FischerKastenmuller2011 /&gt;

=== Personal attributes ===
Selective exposure avoids information inconsistent with one's beliefs and attitudes. For example, former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] would only enter a hotel room after the television was turned on and tuned to a conservative television channel.&lt;ref name="Hart2009"/&gt; When analyzing a person's [[decision-making]] skills, his or her unique process of gathering relevant information is not the only factor taken into account. Fischer et al. (2010) found it important to consider the information source itself, otherwise explained as the physical being that provided the source of information.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010 /&gt; Selective exposure research generally neglects the influence of indirect decision-related attributes, such as physical appearance. In Fischer et al. (2010) two studies hypothesized that physically attractive information sources resulted in decision makers to be more selective in searching and reviewing decision-relevant information. Researchers explored the impact of social information and its level of physical attractiveness. The data was then analyzed and used to support the idea that selective exposure existed for those who needed to make a decision.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010 /&gt; Therefore, the more attractive an information source was, the more positive and detailed the subject was with making the decision. Physical attractiveness affects an individual's decision because the [[perception]] of quality improves. Physically attractive information sources increased the quality of consistent information needed to make decisions and further increased the selective exposure in decision-relevant information, supporting the researchers' hypothesis.&lt;ref name=FischerKastenmuller2011 /&gt; Both studies concluded that attractiveness is driven by a different selection and evaluation of decision-consistent information. Decision makers allow factors such as physical attractiveness to affect everyday decisions due to the works of selective exposure.
In another study, selective exposure was defined by the amount of individual confidence. Individuals can control the amount of selective exposure depending on whether they have a low self-esteem or high self-esteem. Individuals who maintain higher confidence levels reduce the amount of selective exposure.&lt;ref name=Albarracin2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Albarracin|first1=D.|title=The Role of Defensive Confidence in Preference for Proattitudinal Information: How Believing That One Is Strong Can Sometimes Be a Defensive Weakness|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=30|issue=12|year=2004|pages=1565–1584|doi=10.1177/0146167204271180|pmc=4803283}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albarracín and Mitchell (2004) hypothesized that those who displayed higher confidence levels were more willing to seek out information both consistent and inconsistent with their views. The phrase "decision-consistent information" explains the tendency to actively seek decision-relevant information. Selective exposure occurs when individuals search for information and show systematic preferences towards ideas that are consistent, rather than inconsistent, with their beliefs.&lt;ref name=FischerFischer2010 /&gt; On the contrary, those who exhibited low levels of confidence were more inclined to examine information that did not agree with their views. The researchers found that in three out of five studies participants showed more confidence and scored higher on the ''Defensive Confidence Scale'',&lt;ref name=Albarracin2004 /&gt; which serves as evidence that their hypothesis was correct.

Bozo et al. (2009) investigated the anxiety of fearing death and compared it to various age groups in relation to health-promoting behaviors. Researchers analyzed the data by using the [[terror management theory]] and found that age had no direct effect on specific behaviors. The researchers thought that a fear of death would yield health-promoting behaviors in young adults. When individuals are reminded of their own death, it causes stress and anxiety, but eventually leads to positive changes in their health behaviors. Their conclusions showed that older adults were consistently better at promoting and practicing good health behaviors, without thinking about death, compared to young adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bozo|first1=Özlem|last2=Tunca| first2=Ayča|last3=Šimšek|first3=Yeliz|title=The Effect of Death Anxiety and Age on Health-Promoting Behaviors: A Terror-Management Theory Perspective|journal=The Journal of Psychology|volume=143|issue=4|year=2009|pages=377–389|doi=10.3200/JRLP.143.4.377-389}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young adults were less motivated to change and practice health-promoting behaviors because they used the selective exposure to confirm their prior beliefs. Selective exposure thus creates barriers between the behaviors in different ages, but there is no specific age at which people change their behaviors.

Though physical appearance will impact one's personal decision regarding an idea presented, a study conducted by Van Dillen, Papies, and Hofmann (2013) suggests a way to decrease the influence of personal attributes and selective exposure on [[decision-making]]. The results from this study showed that people do pay more attention to physically attractive or tempting stimuli; however, this phenomenon can be decreased through increasing the "cognitive load." In this study, increasing cognitive activity led to a decreased impact of physical appearance and selective exposure on the individual's impression of the idea presented. This is explained by acknowledging that we are instinctively drawn to certain physical attributes, but if the required resources for this attraction are otherwise engaged at the time, then we might not notice these attributes to an equal extent. For example, if a person is simultaneously engaging in a mentally challenging activity during the time of exposure, then it is likely that less attention will be paid to appearance, which leads to a decreased impact of selective exposure on [[decision-making]].&lt;ref name="VanDillen2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Dillen|first1=Lotte F.|last2=Papies|first2=Esther K.|last3=Hofmann|first3=Wilhelm|title=Turning a blind eye to temptation: How cognitive load can facilitate self-regulation.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|date=2013|volume=104|issue=3|pages=427–443|doi=10.1037/a0031262|url=http://www.goallab.nl/publications/documents/van%20Dillen,%20Papies,%20Hofmann,%202013,%20JPSP.pdf|pmid=23276276|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416150238/http://www.goallab.nl/publications/documents/van%20Dillen,%20Papies,%20Hofmann,%202013,%20JPSP.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories accounting for selective exposure ==

[[File:Festinger cover.png|thumbnail|Festinger's groundbreaking study on cognitive dissonance is the foundation for Modern Selective Exposure Theory.]]

=== Cognitive dissonance theory ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Festinger.jpg|thumbnail|left|Eminent 1960s psychological theorist Leon Festinger]] --&gt;
[[Leon Festinger]] is widely considered as the father of modern social psychology and as an important figure to that field of practice as Freud was to clinical psychology and Piaget was to developmental psychology.&lt;ref name="Zajonc1990"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zajonc|first1=R. B.|title=Obituary: Leon Festinger (1919–1989)|journal=American Psychologist|date=1990|volume=45|issue=5|pages=661–662|doi=10.1037/h0091620}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered to be one of the most significant social psychologists of the 20th century. His work demonstrated that it is possible to use the scientific method to investigate complex and significant social phenomena without reducing them to the mechanistic connections between stimulus and response that were the basis of [[behaviorism]].&lt;ref name="Zajonc1990" /&gt; Festinger proposed the groundbreaking theory of [[cognitive dissonance]] that has become the foundation of  selective exposure theory today despite the fact that Festinger was considered as an "avant-garde" psychologist when he had first proposed it in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an ironic twist, Festinger realized that he himself was a victim of the effects of selective exposure.  He was a heavy smoker his entire life and when he was diagnosed with terminal cancer in 1989, he was said to have joked, "Make sure that everyone knows that it wasn't lung cancer!"&lt;ref name="Zajonc1990"/&gt; Cognitive dissonance theory explains that when a person either consciously or unconsciously realizes conflicting attitudes, thoughts, or beliefs, they experience mental discomfort. Because of this, an individual will avoid such conflicting information in the future since it produces this discomfort, and they will gravitate towards messages sympathetic to their own previously held conceptions.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decision makers are unable to evaluate information quality independently on their own (Fischer, Jonas, Dieter &amp; Kastenmüller, 2008).&lt;ref name="FischerJonas2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Jonas|first2=Eva|last3=Frey |first3=Dieter|last4=Kastenmüller|first4=Andreas|title=Selective exposure and decision framing: The impact of gain and loss framing on confirmatory information search after decisions|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=2|year=2008|pages=312–320|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2007.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is a conflict between pre-existing views and information encountered, individuals will experience an unpleasant and self-threatening state of aversive-arousal which will motivate them to reduce it through selective exposure. They will begin to prefer information that supports their original decision and neglect conflicting information. Individuals will then exhibit confirmatory information to defend their positions and reach the goal of dissonance reduction.&lt;ref name="FischerLea2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|last2=Lea|first2=Stephen|last3=Kastenmüller|first3=Andreas|last4=Greitemeyer|first4=Tobias|last5=Fischer|first5=Julia|last6=Frey|first6=Dieter|title=The process of selective exposure: Why confirmatory information search weakens over time|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=114|issue=1|year=2011|pages=37–48|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive dissonance theory insists that dissonance is a psychological state of tension that people are motivated to reduce {{harv|Festinger|1957}}. Dissonance causes feelings of unhappiness, discomfort, or distress. {{harvtxt|Festinger|1957|p=13}} asserted the following: "These two elements are in a dissonant relation if, considering these two alone, the obverse of one element would follow from the other." To reduce dissonance, people add consonant cognition or change evaluations for one or both conditions in order to make them more consistent mentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Matsumoto|first1=Takao|title=Connectionist interpretation of the association between cognitive dissonance and attention switching|journal=Neural Networks|date=2014|volume=60|pages=119–132|doi=10.1016/j.neunet.2014.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Festinger's theory, there are two basic hypotheses:

1) The existence of dissonance, being psychologically uncomfortable, will motivate the person to try to reduce the dissonance and achieve consonance.

2) When dissonance is present, in addition to trying to reduce it, the person will actively avoid situations and information which would likely increase the dissonance {{harv|Festinger|1957|p=3}}.

The theory of [[cognitive dissonance]] was developed in the mid-1950s to explain why people of strong convictions are so resistant in changing their beliefs even in the face of undeniable contradictory evidence. It occurs when people feel an attachment to and responsibility for a decision, position or behavior. It increases the motivation to justify their positions through selective exposure to confirmatory information (Fischer, 2011). Fischer suggested that people have an inner need to ensure that their beliefs and behaviors are consistent. In an experiment that employed commitment manipulations, it impacts perceived decision certainty. Participants were free to choose attitude-consistent and inconsistent information to write an essay. Those who wrote an attitude-consistent essay showed higher levels of confirmatory information search (Fischer, 2011).&lt;ref name="Fischer2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Peter|title=Selective Exposure, Decision Uncertainty, and Cognitive Economy: A New Theoretical Perspective on Confirmatory Information Search|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=5|issue=10|year=2011|pages=751–762|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2011.00386.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The levels and magnitude of dissonance also play a role. Selective exposure to consistent information is likely under certain levels of dissonance. At high levels, a person is expected to seek out information that increases dissonance because the best strategy to reduce dissonance would be to alter one's attitude or decision (Smith et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="SmithFabrigar2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Steven M.|last2=Fabrigar|first2=Leandre R.|last3=Norris|first3=Meghan E.|title=Reflecting on Six Decades of Selective Exposure Research: Progress, Challenges, and Opportunities|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|volume=2|issue=1|year=2008|pages=464–493|doi=10.1111/j.1751-9004.2007.00060.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent research on selective exposure within the dissonance theory produced weak empirical support until the dissonance theory was revised and new methods, more conducive to measuring selective exposure, were implemented.&lt;ref name="Frey1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Frey|first=D|title=Recent research on selective exposure to information|journal=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|year=1986|volume=19|pages=41–80|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60212-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, scholars still argue that empirical results supporting the selective exposure hypothesis are still mixed. This is possibly due to the problems with the methods of the experimental studies conducted.&lt;ref name="TaberLodge2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taber|first1=Charles S.|last2=Lodge|first2=Milton|title=Motivated Skepticism in the Evaluation of Political Beliefs|journal=American Journal of Political Science|volume=50|issue=3|year=2006|pages=755–769|doi=10.1111/j.1540-5907.2006.00214.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason for the mixed results may be the failure to simulate an authentic media environment in the experiments.&lt;ref name=Knobloch-Westerwick2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knobloch-Westerwick|first1=S.|first2=Jingbo|last2= Meng|title=Looking the Other Way: Selective Exposure to Attitude-Consistent and Counterattitudinal Political Information|journal=Communication Research|date=16 March 2009|volume=36|issue=3|pages=426–448|doi=10.1177/0093650209333030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Festinger, the motivation to seek or avoid information depends on the magnitude of dissonance experienced (Smith et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="SmithFabrigar2008" /&gt; It is observed that there is a tendency for people to seek new information or select information that supports their beliefs in order to reduce dissonance.
There exist three possibilities which will affect extent of dissonance {{harv|Festinger|1957|pp=127–131}}:

* Relative absence of dissonance.

When little or no dissonance exists, there is little or no motivation to seek new information. For example, when there is an absence of dissonance, the lack of motivation to attend or avoid a lecture on 'The Advantages of Automobiles with Very High Horsepower Engines' will be independent of whether the car a new owner has recently purchased has a high or low horsepower engine. However, it is important to note the difference between a situation when there is no dissonance and when the information has no relevance to the present or future behavior. For the latter, accidental exposure, which the new car owner does not avoid, will not introduce any dissonance; while for the former individual, who also does not avoid information, dissonance may be accidentally introduced.

* The presence of moderate amounts of dissonance.

The existence of dissonance and consequent pressure to reduce it will lead to an active search of information, which will then lead people to avoid information that will increase dissonance. However, when faced with a potential source of information, there will be an ambiguous cognition to which a subject will react in terms of individual expectations about it. If the subject expects the cognition to increase dissonance, they will avoid it. In the event that one's expectations are proven wrong, the attempt at dissonance reduction may result in increasing it instead. It may in turn lead to a situation of active avoidance.

* The presence of extremely large amounts of dissonance.

If two cognitive elements exist in a dissonant relationship, the magnitude of dissonance matches the resistance to change. If the dissonance becomes greater than the resistance to change, then the least resistant elements of cognition will be changed, reducing dissonance. When dissonance is close to the maximum limit, one may actively seek out and expose oneself to dissonance-increasing information. If an individual can increase dissonance to the point where it is greater than the resistance to change, he will change the cognitive elements involved, reducing or even eliminating dissonance. Once dissonance is increased sufficiently, an individual may bring himself to change, hence eliminating all dissonance {{harv|Festinger|1957|pp=127–131}}.

The reduction in [[cognitive dissonance]] following a decision can be achieved by selectively looking for decision-consonant information and avoiding contradictory information. The objective is to reduce the discrepancy between the cognitions, but the specification of which strategy will be chosen is not explicitly addressed by the dissonance theory. It will be dependent on the quantity and quality of the information available inside and outside the cognitive system.&lt;ref name=Frey1986 /&gt;

=== Klapper's selective exposure ===
In the early 1960s, Columbia University researcher Joseph T. Klapper asserted in his book ''The Effects Of Mass Communication'' that audiences were not passive targets of political and commercial propaganda from mass media but that mass media reinforces previously held convictions. Throughout the book, he argued that the media has a small amount of power to influence people and, most of the time, it just reinforces our preexisting attitudes and beliefs. He argued that the media effects of relaying or spreading new public messages or ideas were minimal because there is a wide variety of ways in which individuals filter such content. Due to this tendency, Klapper argued that media content must be able to ignite some type of cognitive activity in an individual in order to communicate its message.&lt;ref name="Heath2004" /&gt; Prior to Klapper's research, the prevailing opinion was that mass media had a substantial power to sway individual opinion and that audiences were passive consumers of prevailing media [[propaganda]].  However, by the time of the release of ''The Effects of Mass Communication'', many studies led to a conclusion that many specifically targeted messages were completely ineffective.  Klapper's research showed that individuals gravitated towards media messages that bolstered previously held convictions that were set by peer groups, societal influences, and family structures and that the accession of these messages over time did not change when presented with more recent media influence.  Klapper noted from the review of research in the social science that given the abundance of content within the mass media, audiences were selective to the types of programming that they consumed.  Adults would patronize media that was appropriate for their demographics and children would eschew media that was boring to them.  So individuals would either accept or reject a mass media message based upon internal filters that were innate to that person.&lt;ref name="Heath2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heath|first=Robert L.|title=Encyclopedia of Public Relations|editor-last=Heath|editor-first=Robert L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVF2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT798|volume=2|year=2004|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4522-6545-2|pages=738–740|chapter=Reinforcement Theory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are Klapper's five mediating factors and conditions to affect people:&lt;ref name="Klapper1960"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klapper|first=Joseph T.|title=The effects of mass communication|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzcGAQAAIAAJ|year=1960|publisher=Free Press|page=19|lccn=60014402}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Predispositions and the related processes of selective exposure, [[selective perception]], and [[selective retention]].
*The groups, and the norms of groups, to which the audience members belong.
*Interpersonal dissemination of the content of communication
*The exercise of [[opinion leadership]]
*The nature of mass media in a free enterprise society.
Three basic concepts:
*Selective exposure – people keep away from communication of opposite hue.
*[[Selective perception]] – If people are confronting unsympathetic material, they do not perceive it, or make it fit for their existing opinion.
*[[Selective retention]] –  refers to the process of categorizing and interpreting information in a way that favors one category or interpretation over another. Furthermore, they just simply forget the unsympathetic material.

Groups and group norms work as mediators. For example, one can be strongly disinclined to change to the Democratic Party if their family has voted Republican for a long time. In this case, the person's predisposition to the political party is already set, so they don't perceive information about Democratic Party or change voting behavior because of [[mass communication]]. Klapper's third assumption is inter-personal dissemination of mass communication. If someone is already exposed by close friends, which creates predisposition toward something, it will lead to an increase in exposure to mass communication and eventually reinforce the existing opinion. An [[opinion leader]] is also a crucial factor to form one's predisposition and can lead someone to be exposed by mass communication. The nature of commercial mass media also leads people to select certain types of media contents.

=== Cognitive economy model ===

This new model combines the motivational and cognitive processes of selective exposure. In the past, selective exposure had been studied from a motivational standpoint. For instance, the reason behind the existence of selective exposure was that people felt motivated to decrease the level of dissonance they felt while encountering inconsistent information. They also felt motivated to defend their decisions and positions, so they achieved this goal by exposing themselves to consistent information only. However, the new cognitive economy model not only takes into account the motivational aspects, but it also focuses on the cognitive processes of each individual. For instance, this model proposes that people cannot evaluate the quality of inconsistent information objectively and fairly because they tend to store more of the consistent information and use this as their reference point. Thus, inconsistent information is often observed with a more critical eye in comparison to consistent information. According to this model, the levels of selective exposure experienced during the decision-making process are also dependent on how much cognitive energy people are willing to invest. Just as people tend to be careful with their finances, cognitive energy or how much time they are willing to spend evaluating all the evidence for their decisions works the same way. People are hesitant to use this energy; they tend to be careful so they don't waste it. Thus, this model suggests that selective exposure does not happen in separate stages. Rather, it is a combined process of the individuals' certain acts of motivations and their management of the cognitive energy.&lt;ref name="Krueger, J. I. 2012"/&gt;

=== Media ===
[[File:ThreeWiseCryptoPartyMonkeys.jpg|thumb|Individuals tailor their media choices to avoid cognitive dissonance and avoid mental incongruity.]]
Recent studies have shown relevant empirical evidence for the pervasive influence of selective exposure on the greater population at large due to [[mass media]]. Researchers have found that individual media consumers will seek out programs to suit their individual emotional and cognitive needs. Individuals will seek out palliative forms of media during the recent times of economic crisis to fulfill a "strong surveillance need" and to decrease chronic dissatisfaction with life circumstances as well as fulfill needs for companionship.&lt;ref name="Kim2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Jinhee|last2=Kim|first2=Jung-Hyun|last3=Seo|first3=Mihye|title=Toward a Person × Situation Model of Selective Exposure: Repressors, Sensitizers, and Choice of Online News on Financial Crisis|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|date=2014|volume=26|issue=2|pages=59–69|doi=10.1027/1864-1105/a000111}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consumers tend to select media content that exposes and confirms their own ideas while avoiding information that argues against their opinion. A study conducted in 2012 has shown that this type of selective exposure affects pornography consumption as well. Individuals with low levels of [[life satisfaction]] are more likely to have casual sex after consumption of pornography that is congruent with their attitudes while disregarding content that challenges their inherently permissive 'no strings attached' attitudes.&lt;ref name="Wright2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wright|first1=Paul J.|title=A Longitudinal Analysis of US Adults' Pornography Exposure|journal=Journal of Media Psychology|date=2012|volume=24|issue=2|pages=67–76|doi=10.1027/1864-1105/a000063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music selection is also affected by selective exposure. A 2014 study conducted by Christa L. Taylor and Ronald S. Friedman at the SUNY University at Albany, found that mood congruence was effected by self-regulation of music mood choices.  Subjects in the study chose happy music when feeling angry or neutral but listened to sad music when they themselves were sad. The choice of sad music given a sad mood was due less to mood-mirroring but as a result of subjects having an aversion to listening to happy music that was cognitively dissonant with their mood.&lt;ref name="Taylor2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Christa L.|last2=Friedman|first2=Ronald S.|title=Differential influence of sadness and disgust on music preference.|journal=Psychology of Popular Media Culture|date=2014|volume=3|issue=4|pages=195–205|doi=10.1037/ppm0000045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politics are more likely to inspire selective exposure among consumers as opposed to single exposure decisions. For example, in their 2009 meta-analysis of Selective Exposure Theory, Hart et al. reported that "A 2004 survey by The Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press (2006) found that Republicans are about 1.5 times more likely to report watching [[Fox News]] regularly than are Democrats (34% for Republicans and 20% of Democrats). In contrast, Democrats are 1.5 times more likely to report watching [[CNN]] regularly than Republicans (28% of Democrats vs. 19% of Republicans). Even more striking, Republicans are approximately five times more likely than Democrats to report watching "[[The O'Reilly Factor]]" regularly and are seven times more likely to report listening to "[[Rush Limbaugh]]" regularly."&lt;ref name="HartAlbarracin2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=William|last2=Albarracín|first2=Dolores|last3=Eagly|first3=Alice H.|last4=Brechan|first4=Inge|last5=Lindberg|first5=Matthew J.|last6=Merrill|first6=Lisa|title=Feeling validated versus being correct: A meta-analysis of selective exposure to information.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=135|issue=4|year=2009|pages=555–588|doi=10.1037/a0015701|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/polisci/faculty/chwe/austen/hart2009.pdf|pmid=19586162|pmc=4797953}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, when the opinions of Republicans who only tune into conservative media outlets were compared to those of their fellow conservatives in a study by Stroud (2010), their beliefs were considered to be more polarized. The same result was retrieved from the study of liberals as well.&lt;ref name="Perloff, R. M. 2013"&gt;Perloff, R. M. (2013). Political persuasion. In James Price Dillard and Lijiang Shen (Eds.), ''The SAGE Handbook of Persuasion: Developments in Theory and Practice.'' Retrieved from the Gale Virtual Reference Library database.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to our greater tendency toward selective exposure, current political campaigns have been characterized as being extremely partisan and polarized. As Bennett and Iyengar (2008) commented, "The new, more diversified information environment makes it not only more feasible for consumers to seek out news they might find agreeable but also provides a strong economic incentive for news organizations to cater to their viewers' political preferences."&lt;ref name="Perloff, R. M. 2013"/&gt; Selective exposure thus plays a role in shaping and reinforcing individuals' political attitudes. 
[[File:Televison Hungarian ORION 1957.jpg|thumb|210px|Television is the most pervasive conduit of selective exposure in modern society.]]
In early research, selective exposure originally provided an explanation for limited media effects. The "limited effects" model of communication emerged in the 1940s with a shift in the media effects paradigm. This shift suggested that while the media has effects on consumers' behavior such as their voting behavior, these effects are limited and influenced indirectly by interpersonal discussions and the influence of [[opinion leaders]]. Selective exposure was considered one necessary function in the early studies of media's limited power over citizens' attitudes and behaviors.&lt;ref name="LazarsfeldBerelson1948"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lazarsfeld|first1=Paul Felix|last2=Berelson|first2=Bernard|last3=Gaudet|first3=Hazel|title=The People's Choice: How the Voter Makes Up His Mind in a Presidential Campaign|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-lnIFR02FIC&amp;q=selective+exposure|edition=2nd|year=1948|publisher=Columbia University Press|lccn=48008605|oclc=2168461|p=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political ads deal with selective exposure as well because people are more likely to favor a politician that agrees with their own beliefs. Another significant effect of selective exposure comes from Stroud (2010) who analyzed the relationship between partisan selective exposure and political polarization. Using data from the 2004 [[National Annenberg Election Survey]], analysts found that over time partisan selective exposure leads to polarization.&lt;ref name="Stroud2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stroud|first1=Natalie Jomini|title=Polarization and Partisan Selective Exposure|journal=Journal of Communication|volume=60|issue=3|year=2010|pages=556–576|doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.2010.01497.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is plausible because people can easily create or have access to blogs, websites, chats, and online forums where those with similar views and political ideologies can congregate. Much of the research has also shown that political interaction online tends to be polarized. Further evidence for this polarization in the political blogosphere can be found in the Lawrence et al. (2010)'s&lt;ref name="Lawrence2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lawrence|first1=Eric|last2=Sides|first2=John|last3=Farrell|first3=Henry|title=Self-Segregation or Deliberation? Blog Readership, Participation, and Polarization in American Politics|journal=Perspectives on Politics|date=2010|volume=8|issue=1|pages=141|doi=10.1017/S1537592709992714|url=http://themonkeycage.org/blogpaper.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304174524/http://themonkeycage.org/blogpaper.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; study on blog readership that people tend to read blogs that reinforce rather than challenge their political beliefs. According to Cass Sunstein's book, ''Republic.com'', the presence of selective exposure on the web creates an environment that breeds political polarization and extremism. Due to easy access to social media and other online resources, people are " likely to hold even stronger views than the ones they started with, and when these views are problematic, they are likely to manifest increasing hatred toward those espousing contrary beliefs."&lt;ref&gt;Stavrositu, Carmen (2014). "Selective Exposure". In Harvey, Kerric (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Social Media and Politics''. SAGE Publications. pp. 1117–1119. {{ISBN|978-1-4522-9026-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This illustrates how selective exposure can influence an individual's political beliefs and subsequently his participation in the political system.

One of the major academic debates on the concept of selective exposure is whether selective exposure contributes to people's exposure to diverse viewpoints or polarization. Scheufele and Nisbet (2012)&lt;ref name=Scheufele2012&gt;{{cite book

Ideally, true civil deliberation among citizens would be the rational exchange of non-like-minded views (or disagreement). However, many of us tend to avoid disagreement on a regular basis because we do not like to confront with others who hold views that are strongly opposed to our own. In this sense, the authors question about whether exposure to non-like-minded information brings either positive or negative effects on democratic citizenship. While there are mixed findings of peoples' willingness to participate in the political processes when they encounter disagreement, the authors argue that the issue of selectivity needs to be further examined in order to understand whether there is a truly deliberative discourse in online media environment.

'''''Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War''''' is a [[nonfiction]] scientific warfare book written by award-winning author and [[University of Wyoming]] professor, [[Jeffrey A. Lockwood]]. Published in 2008 by [[Oxford University Press]], the book explores the history of [[bioterrorism]], [[entomological warfare]], [[biological warfare]], and the prevention of [[agro-terrorism]] from the earliest times to modern threats.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt; Lockwood, an entomologist, preceded this book with ''Ethical issues in biological control'' (1997) and ''Locust: The devastating rise and mysterious disappearance of the insect that shaped the American frontier'' (2004), among others.

==Summary==
''Six-Legged Soldiers'' gives detailed examples of entomological warfare:  using buckets of scorpions during a fortress siege, [[catapult]]ing [[beehive]]s ("bee bombs") across a castle wall, civilians as human [[human subject research|guinea pigs]] in an effort to weaponize the [[Bubonic Plague|plague]], bombarding civilians from the air with infection-bearing insects, and [[Triatominae|assassin bugs]] placed on prisoners to eat away their flesh.&lt;ref name="timesonline" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Publishers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6587574.html |title=Nonfiction Reviews |date=August 18, 2008 |work=Six-Legged Soldiers: Using Insects as Weapons of War Jeffrey A.

[[File:St._Maria_kilisesi_dış_cephe.jpg|alt=Halit Ziya Bulvarı , Pasaport, İZMİR|thumb|St. Maria Kilisesi konum]]

'''Santa Maria Catholic Church''' is located in old [[Levantines (Latin Christians)|Frankish]] neighborhood, [[Passport district]], and opened for worship in 1689. When the church was damaged from fire, it was built again in 1890. Church was made in honor of the [[Virgin Mary]]. There have been [[missionaries]] in [[Izmir]] since 14th century. A climate of tolerance in Izmir has helped the missionaries to find the working place and there was an influx of [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]] missionaries in Izmir at those years.
So the St. Maria church was maden by the Franciscans who were settled in Izmir first. Today It is used as an Italian Catholic Church and the [[Franciscan]] priests are serving. The community of the church is about 200 people. Another point about the church is; it is known as "Sailor's Church" because of the location.

== Building ==
[[File:St_maria_kilisesi_iç_mekan_.jpg|thumb|St.Maria Catholic Church interior|left]]
The North, South and east facades of the church is quite simply, but main facade and the interior space have ornate fine work. Antique age architecture was simulated in this church. The first things that we can see in interior space are ceiling with iron construction, ceiling ornates and apse. Building was placed symmetrical and longitudinal east-west direction. It has single-aisled basilica plan. It has signs from renaissance and baroque age. We can see these signs in windows, columns and the material that were used. There are too many corinth column in the church. In the entrance, there are three doors, one of them is main the other doors are side doors. The main door is opened in only ritual days.

When we enter the space from outer door, three doors (one main, two side) greet us. These three doors open in main church hall and gloomy ambiance of narthex is decrease with the help of the big volume and double height, thus the sumptuous and spacious interior space greets us. The interior is a rectangular volume that length is longer than wide. First things that we can see inside the depictions of the angels, Virgin Mary, Jesus and extravagant decorations that are maden with fine workmanship. There are six niches  whiche are placed both side of the nave. There are figures, paintings and columns in these niches. Mostly corinthian column type was used in the church. This shows that they paid attention to the interior decoration. We feel this divine atmosphere thanks to cross figures, Virgin Mary and Jesus sculptures. The dome which is located above the apse space was painted in blue color . This blue color symbolized sky and glory.

== Structural system ==
[[File:Çatı_detay.jpg|thumb|St. Maria Catholic Church roof detail]]
Santa Maria Church's structural system is masonry wall. Facades of the church are plain. East facede (which is main facade) is horizontally divided over two floor and it was terminated with a triangular pediment. The roof type is pitch roof and it was reinforced with the iron-truss construction elements. These iron construction's aim is supporting and they are used as vault. The altar is covered by a dome on an octagonal lantern. The windows are round-arched window. They used gold and marble for create rich view and artistic effect in decorations as density. In additions, there are graphic style frescos on the walls. On the floor, Malta style workmanship was applied. Religious motifs, cross and Angels are at the forefront. Generally light and dark colors were used to create contrast. All wooden elements of the church are dark brown.

'''State/Space theory''' constitutes a new branch of [[social geography|social]] and [[political geography]] in which the issues of space as a geographic element are considered for their influence on political relationships and outcomes. Leading scholars include [[Neil Brenner]] at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, and [[Bob Jessop]] at Lancaster University in [[England]], [[United Kingdom]].

Other relevant scholars include the following: [[Henri Lefebvre]], [[Charles Tilly]], [[Saskia Sassen]], and [[Edward W. Soja]].

{{orphan|date=November 2018}}
'''Statecraft''' is an approach to the study of [[political science]] and [[public administration]] that was first developed by [[Jim Bulpitt]].  It understands politics and policy making in a polity by focusing on governing challenges and strategic choices by the leadership at the top of government.  Later scholars used the approach to develop a neo-statecraft approach which could be used to understand politics and policy making across many political systems.

== Origins ==

The origins of statecraft theory is in the work of British academic [[Jim Bulpitt]].  He argued that the [[UK Conservative party]] governments of the early 1980s, under the leadership of [[Margaret Thatcher]], were not motivated by ideological position.  Instead, he controversially argued that they were motivated by winning power.  What motivates politicians, he argued, was their objective of statecraft.  This was defined as the ‘art of winning elections and art of winning elections and achieving some necessary degree of governing competence in office’..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bulpitt |first1=Jim |title=The discipline of the New Democracy: Mrs. Thatcher's Domestic Statecraft |journal=Political Studies |date=1986 |volume=34 |issue=1 |page=19–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to criticisms of the approach, later scholars sought to reflect on the philosophical underpinnings, provided more information about how it could be applied using empirical research and introduced new concepts.  The term neo-statecraft was coined to capture the revised approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=Toby S. |title=Neo-Statecraft Theory, Historical Institutionalism and Institutional Change |journal=Government and Opposition |date=2016 |volume=51 |issue=1 |page=84–110 |doi=10.1017/gov.2014.22 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/neostatecraft-theory-historical-institutionalism-and-institutional-change/AD601F856E991AECDBC6C9CEEC64CD0A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neo-Statecraft Theory ==

The more recent neo-statecraft variant has a number of core assumptions.  

# The primary focus is on the political leader of the state and their closest advisers.  The group is referred to as the leadership 'Court'.   
# The Court is a unitary, rational and self-interested actor with the primary governing objective of winning and maintaining power.  Rather than seeking to achieve any ideological goals, the Court seeks to achieve statecraft.   
# In order to achieve statecraft, they have to undertake five key tasks  
::Governing competence – governments and leaders need to be seen as competent at managing the country’s affairs, particularly the economy.  
::Party management – managing parliamentary backbenchers, constituency associations and pressure groups carefully.  
::Developing a winning electoral strategy – creating a set of policies and image that creates momentum in the polls.  
::Political argument hegemony – winning the battle of ideas in elite debates  
::Bending the rules of the game – they will seek to tilt the political game by introducing constitutional reforms that makes statecraft easier.  

The Court will will find itself in a strategically selective context, which might make statecraft easier or more difficult to achieve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buller |first1=Jim |last2=James |first2=Toby S. |title=Integrating Structural Context into the Assessment of Political Leadership: Realism, Gordon Brown and the Great Financial Crisis |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |date=2015 |volume=68 |issue=1 |page=77–96 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsu012 |url=https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/68/1/77/2755186}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It has been argued, for example, that Gordon Brown faced a particularly difficult context to govern in because of the financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buller |first1=Jim |last2=James |first2=Toby S. |title=Integrating Structural Context into the Assessment of Political Leadership: Realism, Gordon Brown and the Great Financial Crisis |journal=Parliamentary Affairs |date=2015 |volume=68 |issue=1 |page=77–96 |doi=10.1093/pa/gsu012 |url=https://academic.oup.com/pa/article-abstract/68/1/77/2755186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The approach is premised in critical realism and compatible with work [[historical institutionalism]], rather than [[Positivism|positivist]] and [[Behaviorism|behaviouralist]] approaches to political science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=James |first1=Toby S. |title=Neo-Statecraft Theory, Historical Institutionalism and Institutional Change |journal=Government and Opposition |date=2016 |volume=51 |issue=1 |page=84–110 |doi=10.1017/gov.2014.22 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/government-and-opposition/article/neostatecraft-theory-historical-institutionalism-and-institutional-change/AD601F856E991AECDBC6C9CEEC64CD0A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

The approach has been used in a variety of settings, such as a method for assessing political leaders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Clarke |first1=Charles |last2=James |first2=Toby S. |title=British Labour Leaders |date=2015 |publisher=Biteback |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Using the approach, assessments have been made of [[Tony Blair]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Buller |first1=Jim |last2=James |first2=Toby S. |title=Statecraft and the Assessment of National Political Leaders: the Case of New Labour and Tony Blair |journal=British Journal of Politics and International Relations |date=2012 |volume=14 |issue=4 |page=534–555}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stacey |first1=Jamie |title=The Statecraft approach: A case study of Nicolas Sarkozy |journal=French Politics |date=2013 |volume=11 |issue=3 |page=284–306 |doi=10.1057/fp.2013.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  It has also been applied to understand how and why elites change electoral laws&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=James |first1=Toby S. |title=Elite Statecraft and Election Administration |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave |location=London and New York |url=https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9780230308428}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the British policy towards the European Union&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buller |first1=Jim |title=National Statecraft and European Integration |date=2000 |publisher=Cassell |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9561">'''''Surnaturel''''' is a book written by the [[Roman-Catholic]] theologian [[Henri de Lubac]]. It stands among his most famous and controversial works.

In this book he traces the historical meaning of the word 'supernatural' and notes a shift in implication. Up to the High Middle Ages, the essential contrast was drawn between 'natural' and 'moral'. After that, the contrast was seen between 'natural and supernatural'. De Lubac is trying here to establish the correct understanding of [[Aquinas]] on this subject.

==Context==
De Lubac began work on the ideas which would eventually appear as ''Surnaturel'' in his days as a student in Hastings.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth Century Catholic Theologians: From Neoscholasticism to Nuptial Mystery'', (Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), p72&lt;/ref&gt; De Lubac published several articles in the 1930s which were to make up much of ''Surnaturel''. The development of the book itself, though, was greatly hindered by the war. In June 1940, fleeing the advancing Nazis, de Lubac left Lyon with a bag which included the notebook for ''Surnaturel'', on which he worked for several days. De Lubac stated in later years that the book had taken sufficient shape by 1941 to be ready for review; the ''nihil obstat'' was granted in February 1942. However, paper shortages prevented publication. In 1943, while being hunted by the Gestapo, de Lubac fled, again carrying his notebook, this time to Vals. He used the resources in the Vals library to continue his work on the book. Eventually, in October 1945 the ''Imprimatur'' was issued, and in 1946, the book was published (though only as an edition of 700 copies, due to ongoing paper shortages).&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argument==
De Lubac's overall question in ''Surnaturel'' is therefore how human persons in the natural order can be interiorly directed to the order of grace that fulfils them, without in the least possessing this grace in anticipation, and without being able at all to claim it for themselves. In the book, de Lubac attempts to show how, in an attempt to answer this question, what he calls "the system of pure nature" had come to prevail in Catholic theology.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

He argues that in the Fathers and the great scholastics there was only one concrete order of history, that in which God had made humanity for himself, and in which human nature had thus been created only for a single destiny, which was supernatural. Neither the Fathers nor the scholastics, therefore, ever envisioned the possibility of a purely natural end for human persons attainable by their own intrinsic powers of cognition and volition.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

De Lubac argues that this unified vision began to unravel in the thought of theologians such as [[Denys the Carthusian]] and, more pertinently, [[Thomas Cajetan|Cajetan]]. While Denys had argued for a natural end of the human person to which a supernatural end must be 'superadded', he did so consciously in opposition to the teaching of Thomas Aquinas. Cajetan, however, while making a similar argument to Denys, did so while claiming simply to be ''commenting on'' Thomas: he therefore introduced the idea of human nature as "a closed and sufficient whole" into Thomism.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xvii&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of a 'pure nature', argues de Lubac, intensified in the wake of the naturalism of Baius and Jansenius: a state of pure nature - a hypothesis according to which human persons might have been created with an end proportionate to their natural powers - was seen as necessary to protect the gratuity of the supernatural. Affirmation of such a state, argued de Lubac, overlooked the decisive difference between the created human spirit and other natures. Moreover, while allowing Catholic theologians to defend the essential integrity of fallen human nature against the Protestantism that denied it, the system effected a separation between nature and the supernatural that would prove pernicious - by rendering the latter (seemingly) superfluous. Although, de Lubac argues, the system of 'pure nature' was perceived to be a novelty when it first developed, it eventually came to be taken for granted, such that, by the twentieth century, rejecting it became synonymous with denying the gratuity of the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

''Surnaturel ''is broken into four parts, which are pieced together from a number of earlier preparatory studies. 
* The first part, entitled 'Augustinianism and Baianism', examines the interpretation of Augustine by [[Michael Baius|Baius]] and [[Cornelius Jansen|Jansenius]], showing how these two early modern thinkers misconstrue Augustine's true intention. That is, de Lubac argued that, influenced by a juridical-naturalistic way of thinking foreign to Augustine (and to his disciples, including Thomas Aquinas), Baius and Jansenius in their different ways denied the gratuity of the gifts made by God to Adam. De Lubac shows how the hypothesis of 'purely natural finality' attributed to a 'purely spiritual nature' was developed to insure this gratuity.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The second part, 'Spirit and Freedom in the Theological Tradition', examines one of the essential aspects of the spiritual 'nature' (both human and angelic), namely, its freedom of choice with respect to its end. De Lubac considers the tradition from the Fathers up to the seventeenth century, and provides further evidence for the claim that Aquinas, for example, never envisioned any finality for the created spirit but a supernatural one.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The third part examines the origins of the word 'supernatural', including the problematic epithet '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''superadditum''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' ('something superadded'), and the confusion of the 'supernatural' with the 'miraculous' (in the sense of a completely arbitrary addition). De Lubac shows in this section that the term 'supernatural' was first used systematically by St Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* The fourth part offers six 'Historical Notes' on St Thomas and his followers.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the conclusion, 'Divine Exigence and Natural Desire', de Lubac indicates why it is unnecessary to have recourse to the hypothetical system of pure nature to protect the gratuity of the beatific vision.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xviii&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
The publication of the work caused immediate controversy in Catholic thought. De Lubac's thought came to be associated as representing a ''[[Nouvelle Théologie]]'', a name applied to de Lubac's thought by his critics. In 1950, de Lubac was asked by the General of the Jesuits to stop teaching, and to give up working at the journal ''Recherches de Science Religieuse. ''An order was issued to withdraw from Jesuit libraries and from the trade three of his books - ''Surnaturel, Corpus Mysticum'' and ''De la Connaissance de Dieu'', as well as a 1949 article in ''Recherches'' in which de Lubac addressed some criticisms of ''Surnaturel''.&lt;ref&gt;David L Schindler, 'Introduction', in Henri de Lubac, ''The Mystery of the Supernatural'', (New York: Crossroad, 1998), p.xxii&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, it was widely suspected that it was his views which were attacked in the papal encyclical ''[[Humani generis|Humani Generis]]''. De Lubac was ostracised for a decade.

In the early 1960s, however, his ideas became more accepted in the Catholic hierarchy, and he was among the first summoned by [[Pope John XXIII]] to help draft the texts for Vatican II.&lt;ref&gt;F Kerr, ''Twentieth Century Catholic Theologians: From Neoscholasticism to Nuptial Mystery'', (Malden, MA; Oxford: Blackwell, 2007), p76&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965 de Lubac published two works:'' Le Mystere du surnaturel'', and ''Augustinisme et théologie moderne, ''which served primarily to clarify numerous objections to ''Surnaturel. Mystere ''largely followed the structure of the 1949 article with the same title in which de Lubac had responded to some criticisms of ''Surnaturel''. ''Augustinisme ''was a reprint of the first part of ''Surnaturel'', enlarged with some new texts.

==Editions==
* ''Surnaturel: études historiques'', (Paris:Aubier, 1946).
* A new French edition issued by (Paris: Desclée de Brouwer, 1991) contains a complete translation into French of all Greek and Latin citations. 
* There is not yet (2018) an English translation

{{Progressivism}}
{{Transhumanism}}
'''Techno-progressivism''' or '''tech-progressivism'''{{cn|date=March 2016}} is a stance of active support for the [[wikt:convergence|convergence]] of [[technological change]] and [[social change]]. Techno-progressives argue that technological developments can be profoundly [[empowerment|empowering]] and [[freedom (political)|emancipatory]] when they are regulated by legitimate [[democracy|democratic]] and [[accountable]] authorities to ensure that their [[social cost|cost]]s, [[risk]]s and [[cost-benefit analysis|benefits]] are all fairly shared by the actual [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] to those developments.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  The Trouble with "Transhumanism": Part Two|    date = 2004 |   url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20041222/| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  Technoprogressivism Beyond Technophilia and Technophobia|    date = 2005 |   url = http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/carrico20060812/| accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stance==
Techno-progressivism maintains that accounts of [[Progress (history)|progress]] should focus on [[Scientific consensus|scientific]] and [[Technological change|technical]] dimensions, as well as [[ethics of technology|ethical]] and [[technology and society|social]] ones.  For most techno-progressive perspectives, then, the growth of scientific knowledge or the accumulation of technological powers will not represent the achievement of proper progress unless and until it is accompanied by a [[distributive justice|just distribution]] of the [[externality|costs, risks, and benefits]] of these new knowledges and capacities.  At the same time, for most techno-progressive [[social criticism|critic]]s and [[advocacy|advocates]], the achievement of [[participatory democracy|better democracy]], greater [[social justice|fairness]], less violence, and a wider [[civil libertarianism|rights culture]] are all desirable, but inadequate in themselves to confront the quandaries of contemporary technological societies unless and until they are accompanied by [[scientific progress|progress in science]] and technology to support and implement these values.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

Strong techno-progressive positions include support for the [[civil right]] of a [[person]] to either maintain or [[body modification|modify]] his or her own [[cognitive liberty|mind]] and [[morphological freedom|body]], on his or her own terms, through [[informed consent|informed, consensual]] recourse to, or refusal of, available therapeutic or enabling [[biomedical technology]].&lt;ref name="Carrico 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|    author = Carrico, Dale|    title =  The Politics of Morphological Freedom|    date = 2006 |   url = http://amormundi.blogspot.com/2006/08/politics-of-morphological-freedom.html| accessdate=2007-01-28|    authorlink = Dale Carrico}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2016}}

During the November 2014 [[Humanity+|Transvision Conference]], many of the leading [[transhumanist]] organizations signed the Technoprogressive Declaration. The Declaration stated the values of technoprogressivism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/tpdec2014 Technoprogressive Declaration - Transvision 2014, Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrasting stance==
{{Cleanup|reason=This section should move to [[Transhumanist politics]]|date=February 2018}}
{{Main article|Bioconservatism}}
[[Bioconservatism]] (a [[portmanteau]] word combining "[[biology]]" and "[[conservatism]]") is a stance of hesitancy about technological development especially if it is perceived to threaten a given [[social order]]. Strong bioconservative positions include opposition to [[Genetic engineering|genetic modification]] of [[transgenic plants|food crops]], the [[cloning]] and genetic engineering of [[livestock]] and [[pets]], and, most prominently, rejection of the genetic, prosthetic, and cognitive modification of human beings to overcome what are broadly perceived as current human biological and cultural limitations.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

Bioconservatives range in political perspective from [[right-wing politics|right-leaning]] religious and cultural [[conservatism|conservatives]] to [[left-wing politics|left-leaning]] [[environmentalism|environmentalists]] and [[appropriate technology|technology critics]]. What unifies bioconservatives is skepticism about [[medical]] and other [[biotechnology|biotechnological]] transformations of the [[biosphere|living world]].&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mander, Jerry (1991). ‘’In the Absence of the Sacred: The Failure of Technology and the Survival of the Indian Nations,’’, Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, California.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rifkin, Jeremy (1998). ‘’The Biotech Century: Harnessing the Gene and Remaking the World,’’ Jeremy P. Tarcher/Putnam, New York, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shiva, Vandana (2000). ‘’Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply,’’ South End Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically less sweeping as a critique of technological society than [[Neo-Luddism|bioluddism]], the bioconservative perspective is characterized by its defense of the [[natural]], deployed as a [[moral]] category.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

Although techno-progressivism is the stance which contrasts with bioconservatism in the [[biopolitical]] spectrum, both techno-progressivism and bioconservatism, in their more moderate expressions, share an opposition to unsafe, unfair, undemocratic forms of technological development, and both recognize that such developmental modes can facilitate unacceptable [[recklessness (law)|recklessness]] and [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]], exacerbate injustice and incubate dangerous social discontent.&lt;ref name="Carrico 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Carrico 2005"/&gt;

'''''The Profits of Religion: An Essay in Economic Interpretation''''' is a nonfiction book, first published in 1917, by the American novelist and [[muck-raking]] journalist [[Upton Sinclair]]. It is a snapshot of the religious movements in the U.S. before its entry into [[World War I]].

The book is the first of the “Dead Hand” series: six books Sinclair wrote on American [[institution]]s. The series also includes ''[[The Brass Check]]'' (journalism), [[The Goose-step (book)|''The Goose-step'']] (higher education), ''The Goslings'' (elementary and high school education), ''[[Mammonart]]'' (art) and ''Money Writes!'' (literature). The term “Dead Hand” ironically refers to Adam Smith’s concept that allowing an "invisible hand" of individual self-interest to shape economic relations provides the best result for society as a whole.

In this book, Sinclair attacks institutionalized religion as a “source of income to parasites, and the natural ally of every form of oppression and exploitation.”

==Overview==
Most [[clergy]]men are hypocrites, but they are not entirely to blame. Like other men, they are victimized by “the competitive wage-system, which presents them with the alternative to swindle or to starve.”

Sinclair savages the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] establishment for transforming the [[proletarian]] [[Jesus]] into a defender of wealth and privilege, and for a long history of alliance with political power in England and the United States.

Turning to the “nonconforming” [[Protestant]] sects, adherents of "The Church of the Merchants" are focused on achieving prosperity within the existing economic system. So are the devotees of the mostly [[California]]-based ‘new religions’ or ‘cults’, including [[New Thought]].

Sinclair wants to rescue the true message of Jesus, the friend of the poor and brother of all men.

== Style ==
The writing is fluent, vivid and personal. At the same time, almost every paragraph is built upon evidence that includes historic and contemporary quotations, articles, events, and anecdotes. It is not meant to be objective, but to present a compelling case. It reads like the exhaustive oral argument of a very able prosecuting attorney.

== Divisions of the book ==
Note: The chapters of Book Six are listed to give a flavor of Sinclair's writing style.
* Book One: The Church of the Conquerors (Priesthoods living off the wealth produced by workers)
* Book Two: The Church of Good Society ([[Episcopal Church (United States)|Protestant Episcopal]])
* Book Three: The Church of the Servant Girls ([[Catholic Church|Catholic]])
* Book Four: The Church of the Slavers (how institutionalized religion, particularly in Germany, oppresses the people)
* Book Five: The Church of the Merchants (nonconformist [[Protestantism|Protestant]])
* Book Six: The Church of the Quacks
** Tabula Rasa
** The Book of [[Mormonism|Mormon]]
** [[Holy Roller|Holy Rolling]]
** Bible Prophecy
** [[Koreshanity]]
** [[Mazdaznan]]
** Black Magic
** Mental Malpractice
** [[Christian Science|Science and Wealth]]
** New Nonsense
** "Dollars Want Me!"
** Spiritual Financiering
** The Graft of Grace
* Book Seven: The Church of the Social Revolution (based on Jesus the proletarian and brother of all humankind)

== Critical reception ==
Reviewing several of the Dead Hand series, a contemporary critic wrote, "These great pamphlets…are storehouses of laborious research. They are indispensable to any student of present American life. I have heard Upton Sinclair charged with reckless, inaccurate and indiscreet use of his material. I am glad to say here that in my own experience I have found him scrupulously anxious, at whatever trouble to himself, to report the exact facts and to weigh carefully his judgments upon them. Why, then, have not these books the authority which they should have?…His explanation is oversimplified; he tends to see his facts in the light of a single motive." &lt;ref name="Lovett"&gt;[[Robert Morss Lovett|Lovett, Robert Morss]], "Upton Sinclair," ''The English Journal'' 17 (9) (Nov., 1928), 706–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Brass Check'' (1919), Sinclair wrote, "''The Profits of Religion'' was practically boycotted by the capitalist press of America. Just one newspaper, the ''Chicago Daily News'', reviewed it—or rather allowed me space in which to review it myself. Just one religious publication, the ''Churchman,'' took the trouble to ridicule it at length. Half a dozen others sneered at it in brief paragraphs, and half a dozen newspapers did the same, and that was all the publicity the book got, except in the radical press."

[[File:Frankenstein trailer (1931).webm|thumb|right|350px|A trailer for the 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'']]

A '''trailer''' (also known as a '''preview''' or '''coming attraction''') is a commercial [[advertisement]] for a [[feature film]] that will be exhibited in the future at a [[movie theater|cinema]], the result of creative and technical work. The term "trailer" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a feature film screening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://straightdope.com/mailbag/mtrailers.html | title = Why are they called "trailers" if they're shown before the movie? | author = Gfactor | publisher = The Straight Dope | date = 2007-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That practice did not last long, because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film begins.

Movie trailers have now become popular on [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray]] discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Of some 10 billion videos watched online annually, film trailers rank third, after news and user-created video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://awfj.org/2008/05/07/awfj-opinion-poll-all-about-movie-trailers/ | title = AWFJ Opinion Poll: All About Movie Trailers | publisher = AWFJ | date = 2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer format has also been adopted as a promotional tool for television shows, video games, books, and theatrical events/concerts.

== History ==
[[File:The African Queen - trailer.ogv|thumb|Film trailer for ''[[The African Queen (film)|The African Queen]]'' ([[1951 in film|1951]]).]]

The first trailer shown in an American film theater was in November 1913, when [[Nils Granlund]], the advertising manager for the [[Marcus Loew]] theater chain, produced a short promotional film for the musical ''The Pleasure Seekers'', opening at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway. As reported in a wire service story carried by the [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] ''Daily Star'', the practice which Loew adopted was described as "an entirely new and unique stunt", and that "moving pictures of the rehearsals and other incidents connected with the production will be sent out in advance of the show, to be presented to the Loew’s picture houses and will take the place of much of the bill board advertising".&lt;ref&gt;"Movies Score on Legit in New York;" Lincoln, Nebraska ''Daily Star''; November 9, 1913; Page 25&lt;/ref&gt; Granlund was also first to introduce trailer material for an upcoming motion picture, using a slide technique to promote an upcoming film featuring [[Charlie Chaplin]] at Loew's Seventh Avenue Theatre in Harlem in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Blondes, Brunettes, and Bullets, Granlund, N.T.; Van Rees Press, NY, 1957, Page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Trailers were initially shown after, or "trailing", the feature film, and this led to their being called "trailers". The practice was found to be somewhat ineffective, often ignored by audiences who left immediately after the feature. Later, exhibitors changed their practice so that trailers were only one part of the film program, which included cartoon shorts, newsreels, and serial adventure episodes. Today, more elaborate trailers and commercial advertisements have largely replaced other forms of pre-feature entertainment, and in major multiplex chains, about the first 20 minutes after the posted showtime is devoted to trailers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Up until the late 1950s, trailers were mostly created by [[National Screen Service]] and consisted of various key scenes from the film being advertised, often augmented with large, descriptive text describing the story, and an underscore generally pulled from studio music libraries.  Most trailers had some form of narration, and those that did featured [[wiktionary:stentorian|stentorian]] voices.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In the early 1960s, the face of motion picture trailers changed. Textless, montage trailers and quick-editing became popular, largely due to the arrival of the "new Hollywood" and techniques that were becoming increasingly popular in television.  Among the trend setters were [[Stanley Kubrick]] with his montage trailers for ''[[Lolita (1962 film)|Lolita]]'' ([[1962 in film|1962]]), ''[[Dr. Strangelove|Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), and ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' ([[1968 in film|1968]]).  Kubrick's main inspiration for the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer was the short film ''[[Very Nice, Very Nice]]'' ([[1961 in film|1961]]) by Canadian film visionary [[Arthur Lipsett]]. [[Pablo Ferro]], who pioneered the techniques Kubrick required as necessary elements for the success of his campaign, created the ''Dr. Strangelove'' trailer, as well as the award-winning trailer for ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' ([[1971 in film|1971]]).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Many home videos contain trailers for other movies produced by the same company scheduled to be available shortly after the legal release of the video, so as not to spend money advertising the videos on TV. Most [[VHS]] tapes would play them at the beginning of the tape, but some VHS tapes contained previews at the end of the film or at both ends of the tape. VHS tapes that contained trailers at the end usually reminded the viewer to "Stay tuned after the feature for more previews." With [[DVD]]s and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]]s, trailers can operate as a bonus feature instead of having to watch through the trailers before the film.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

== Definition ==
Trailers consist of a series selected shots from the film being advertised. Since the purpose of the trailer is to attract an audience to the film, these excerpts are usually drawn from the most exciting, funny, or otherwise noteworthy parts of the film but in abbreviated form and usually without producing [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]]. For this purpose the scenes are not necessarily in the order in which they appear in the film. A trailer has to achieve that in less than 2 minutes and 30 seconds, the maximum length allowed by the [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]]. Each studio or distributor is allowed to exceed this time limit once a year, if they feel it is necessary for a particular film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trailer music |publisher=SoundtrackNet, LLC |date=30 April 2009 |url=http://www.soundtrack.net/trailers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, the movie theater trade group ''[[National Association of Theatre Owners]]'' issued an industry guideline asking that film distributors supply trailers that run no longer than 2 minutes, which is 30 second shorter than the prior norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.marketingmovies.net/news/theaters-advocate-shorter-trailers-marketing/ | title = Theaters Advocate Shorter Movie Trailers | publisher = MarketingMovies.net | date = 2014-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The guideline is not mandatory, and also allows for limited exceptions of a select few movies having longer trailers. Film distributors reacted coolly to the announcement. There had been no visible disputes on trailer running time prior to the guideline, which surprised many.

Some trailers use "special shoot" footage, which is material that has been created specifically for advertising purposes and does not appear in the actual film. The most notable film to use this technique was ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'', whose trailer featured an elaborate special effect scene of a T-800 Terminator being assembled in a factory that was never intended to be in the film itself. [[Dimension Films]] also shot extra scenes for their 2006 horror remake, ''[[Black Christmas (2006 film)|Black Christmas]]'' - these scenes were used in promotional footage for the film, but are similarly absent from the theatrical release. A trailer for the 2002 blockbuster ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' had an entire action sequence especially constructed that involved escaping bank robbers in a helicopter getting caught in a giant web between the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]'s two towers. However, after the [[September 11 attacks]] the studio pulled it from theaters.

[[File:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (12).jpg|thumb|[[Walt Disney]] in a 1937 color film trailer for ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''.]]

One of the most famous "special shoot" trailers is that used for the 1960s thriller ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', which featured director [[Alfred Hitchcock]] giving viewers a guided tour of the Bates Motel, eventually arriving at the infamous shower. At this point, the soft-spoken Hitchcock suddenly throws the shower curtain back to reveal [[Vera Miles]] with a blood-curdling scream. As the trailer, in fact, was made after completion of the film when [[Janet Leigh]] was no longer available for filming, Hitchcock had Miles don a blonde wig for the fleeting sequence. Since the title, "Psycho", instantly covers most of the screen, the switch went unnoticed by audiences for years until freeze-frame analysis clearly revealed that it was Vera Miles and not Janet Leigh in the shower during the trailer.

There are dozens of companies that specialize in the creation of film trailers in Los Angeles and New York. The trailer may be created at agencies (such as The Cimarron Group, MOJO, The Ant Farm, Ben Cain, Aspect Ratio, Flyer Entertainment, Trailer Park, Buddha Jones) while the film itself is being cut together at the studio.  Since the edited film does not exist at this point, the trailer [[film editor|editor]]s work from [[Dailies|rushes]] or [[dailies]]. Thus, the trailer may contain footage that is not in the final movie, or the trailer editor and the film editor may use different [[take]]s of a particular shot. Another common technique is including music on the trailer which does not appear on the movie's soundtrack. This is nearly always a requirement, as trailers and teasers are created long before the composer has even been hired for the film score—sometimes as much as a year ahead of the movie's release date—while composers are usually the last creative people to work on the film.

Some trailers that incorporate material not in the film are particularly coveted by collectors, especially trailers for classic films. For example, in a trailer for ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' the character Rick Blaine says, "OK, you asked for it!" before shooting Major Strasser; this line of dialogue is not spoken in the final film.

== Truth vs. misleading ==
{{essay|section|date=December 2016}}

Over the years, there have been many instances where trailers give misleading representations of their films. They may give the impression that a celebrity who only has a minor part in the film is one of the main cast members, or advertising a film as being more action-packed than it is. These tricks are usually done to draw in a larger audience. Sometimes the trailers include footage not from the film itself. This could be an artistic choice, or because the trailer was put together before the film's final cut, but at other times it is to give the audience a different impression of the movie. Then trailers could be misleading in a 'for the audience's own good' kind of way, in that a general audience would not usually see such a film due to preconceptions, and by [[bait and switch]]ing, they can allow the audience to have a great viewing experience that they would not ordinarily have. However, the opposite is true too, with the promise of great trailers being let down by mediocre films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.modernman.com/10-incredibly-misleading-movie-trailers/ |title=10 Movie Trailers That Are Nothing Like The Actual Movie |publisher=Modernman.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An American woman sued the makers of ''[[Drive (2011 film)|Drive]]'' because their film "failed to live up to its promo's promise",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hardie|first=Giles|title=Misleading trailer leads to law suit|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/misleading-trailer-leads-to-law-suit-20111011-1lj2z.html|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=October 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Child|first=Ben|title=Woman sues to stop Drive getting away with a 'misleading' trailer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/10/woman-sues-drive-trailer|newspaper=The Guardian|date=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=10/08/11 3:02pm 10/08/11 3:02pm |url=http://gawker.com/5847970/woman-files-lawsuit-over-misleading-trailer-for-drive |title=Woman Files Lawsuit Over 'Misleading' Trailer for Drive |publisher=Gawker.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; although her lawsuit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michbar.org/file/opinions/appeals/2013/101513/55553.pdf ''Deming v.

== Composition ==
Trailers tell the story of a film in a highly condensed fashion to have maximum appeal. In the decades since film marketing has become a large industry, trailers have become highly polished pieces of advertising, able to present even poor movies in an attractive light. Some of the elements common to many trailers are listed below. Trailers are typically made up of scenes from the film they are promoting, but sometimes contain [[deleted scene]]s from the film.

The key ambition in trailer-making is to impart an intriguing story that gets film audiences emotionally involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Marketing to Moviegoers: A Handbook of Strategies and Tactics|first=Robert |last=Marich  |publisher=Southern Illinois University Press |edition=3rd|year=2013 |pages=6–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most trailers have a [[three-act structure]] similar to a feature-length film. They start with a beginning (act 1) that lays out the premise of the story. The middle (act 2) drives the story further and usually ends with a dramatic climax. Act 3 usually features a strong piece of "signature music" (either a recognizable song or a powerful, sweeping orchestral piece). This last act often consists of a visual montage of powerful and emotional moments of the film and may also contain a cast run if there are noteworthy stars that could help sell the movie.

[[Voice-over]] narration is sometimes used to briefly set up the premise of the film and provide explanation when necessary, although this practice has declined in the years after the passing of voice-over artist [[Don LaFontaine]]. Since the trailer is a highly condensed format, voice-over is a useful tool to enhance the audience's understanding of the plot. Some of the best-known, modern-day trailer voice-over artists have been the aforementioned LaFontaine, [[Hal Douglas]], [[Mark Elliot (voice-over artist)|Mark Elliott]], John Leader, [[Corey Burton]], [[George DelHoyo]], [[Peter Cullen]], [[Morgan Freeman]], [[Ashton Smith]], [[Jim Cummings]], John Garry, [[Tom Kane]], [[Nick Schatzki]], [[Ben Patrick Johnson]], Tony Rodgers, [[Beau Weaver]], and [[Brian Cummings]]. Classic voice-over artists in film trailers of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s included Howard Strickling (for MGM), Lou Marcelle (for Warner Bros.), Art Gilmore, Knox Manning, Reed Hadley, Les Tremayne (for MGM), Fred Foy (for MGM), Karl Weber (for MGM) and Bob Marcato. Hollywood trailers of the classic film era were renowned for clichés such as "Colossal!", "Stupendous!", etc. Some trailers have used voice over clichés for satirical effect. This can be seen in trailers for films such as Jerry Seinfeld's Comedian and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny.

[[Music]] helps set the [[setting tone|tone]] and mood of the trailer. Usually the music used in the trailer is not from the film itself (the [[film score]] may not have been composed yet). The music used in the trailer may be:

* Music from the score of other movies.
* Popular or well-known music, often chosen for its tone, appropriateness of a lyric or lack thereof, or recognizability. The most often used of these is ''[[O Fortuna]]'' from ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' by Carl Orff,&lt;ref name="soundtrack.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soundtrack.net/trailers/frequent/ |title=SoundtrackNet : Trailers: Frequently Used Trailer Music |publisher=Soundtrack.net |date= |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the works of [[E.S. Posthumus]] and [[Beethoven]].  Popular music may be selected for its tone (i.e. hard rock for an action film, lighter pop for a romantic comedy), or to establish context (e.g. the trailer for a film set in the 1940s might use big band swing).
* "Library" music previously composed specifically to be used in advertising by an independent composer. There are many trailer music library companies which produce [[trailer music]], some of the best known are [[audiomachine]], [[Two Steps From Hell]], [[Immediate Music]] and [[X-Ray Dog]] or SFX and Music libraries like the ones from Moss Landing, [[Gerrit Kinkel Productions]] or [[RedCola Music|redCola]].
* Specially composed music. One of the most famous Hollywood trailer music composers, credited with creating the musical voice of contemporary trailers, is [[John Beal (composer)|John Beal]], who began scoring trailers in the 1970s and, in the course of a thirty-year career, created original music for over 2,000 film trailer projects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118020113.html?categoryid=4051&amp;cs=1 |title=Daily Variety: Razor-thin copyright line |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; including 40 of the top-grossing films of all time, such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[Braveheart]]'', ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', ''[[The Last Samurai]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''.

A ''cast run'' is a list of the [[movie star|stars]] that appear in the movie. If the [[film director|director]] or [[film producer|producer]] is well-known or has made other popular movies, they often warrant a mention as well. Most trailers conclude with a [[billing (film)|billing]] block, which is a list of the principal [[actor|cast]] and [[film crew|crew]]. It is the same list that appears on posters and print publicity materials, and also usually appears on-screen at the beginning (or end) of the movie. Studio [[production logo]]s are usually featured near the beginning of the trailer. Until the late 1970s, they were put only at the end of the trailer or not used at all; however, [[Paramount Pictures]] was the first studio to use its actual studio logo at the beginning of its trailers in the 1940s. Often there will be logos for both the [[production company]] and [[film distributor|distributor]] of the film.

Many trailers are [[audio mixing (film and television)|mixed]] in Dolby Digital or any other multichannel sound mix. Scenes including sound effects and music that are enhanced by stereophonic sound are therefore the focus point of many modern trailers.

Trailers preceding feature films are generally presented in the same format as the feature, being either 35&amp;nbsp;mm film or a digital format. High bandwidth internet connections allow for trailers to be distributed online at any resolution.  Since the advent of [[Digital 3D|Digital 3&amp;#8209;D]], it has become common for a 3‑D feature film to be preceded by one or more trailers that are also presented in 3‑D.

== Collections ==
National Screen Service contracts required that trailers be returned (at the cinema's expense) or destroyed, however it required no proof of destruction and depositing them in a waste bin counted. A market for trailers evolved as it became clear that some had a commercial value to collectors. Many of the trailers for films like the ''[[Star Wars]]'' series reported as 'destroyed' were taken back out of the bin and sold by cinema staff. As they cost about $60 each to make (1981 estimate) and were hired to the cinema for $10, such losses led to NSS increasing its rental charges, which led to a decrease in the number of trailers rented and shown to audiences.&lt;ref&gt;"Coming Soon to a Theatre Near You - Maybe" in Ares 8, Schow, DJ; Simulations Publications, NY 1981, Page 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cinemas also began to show "trailer trash" programs of trailers without a main feature. Similarly, several DVDs containing nothing but trailers for films, typically from exploitation film genres, have been produced for sale.

== Other types of trailers ==
Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, and along with the development of the Internet and sites such as [[YouTube]] as well as animation techniques, more types of trailers began to be created due to easier and cheaper costs to produce and show trailers.

=== Video game trailers ===
{{Expand section|date=October 2012}}

Beginning in the late 1990s to early 2000s, video game trailers began to be produced as they became more mainstream. Used to entice viewers to go out and play the game, game trailers are very useful. The content and production process is similar to that for movies, complicated by the need to convey the way the game plays. The trailer for Aliens: Colonial Marines, for example, featured graphics that were of a higher standard than the game that was eventually sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/carolpinchefsky/2013/04/03/sega-admits-aliens-colonial-marines-trailer-was-misleading/ |title=Sega Admits 'Aliens: Colonial Marines' Trailer Was Misleading |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hideo Kojima]], a game creator strongly influenced by Hollywood movies, edits the elaborate trailers for his own games from a special studio in his office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Matulef |first=Jeffrey |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-12-war-has-changed-but-has-hideo-kojima |title=War has changed.

=== TV spots ===
TV spots are trailers for movies shown on television that are often shortened to 30–60 seconds. These trailers are similar to green band trailers and have content "appropriate" for the channel.

=== TV show trailers ===
[[TV show]] trailers are trailers advertising a new TV series, episode, event or marathon premiering on television. Trailers for the next episode of a TV series are often shown during or following the closing credits of the show.

=== Book trailer ===
A '''book trailer''' is a [[video]] advertisement for a [[book]] which employs techniques similar to those of [[trailer (film)|movie trailers]] to promote books and encourage readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|title=YouTube video sets stage for novel|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/nov/04/business/fi-vidbooks4|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=November 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; These trailers can also be referred to as "video-podcasts", with higher quality trailers being called "cinematic book trailers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deval|first=Jacqueline|title=Publicize Your Book (Updated): An Insider's Guide to Getting Your Book the Attention It Deserves|year=2008|publisher=Perigee Trade|isbn=0399534318|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4FVhmwgodMUC&amp;pg=PT195&amp;lpg=PT195&amp;dq=%22book+trailer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22book%20trailer%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are circulated on television and online in most common digital video formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Berton|first=Justin|title=Seeking readers via 'book trailer' / Publisher tries out movie-style preview to market new title |url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Seeking-readers-via-book-trailer-Publisher-2488096.php|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=September 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common formats of book trailers include actors performing scenes from the book akin to a movie trailer, full production trailers, flash videos, animation or simple still photos set to music with text conveying the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fox|first=Killian|title=On a screen near you ...|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jul/16/fiction.features7|accessdate=18 August 2012|date=15 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This differs from author readings and interviews, which consist of video footage of the author narrating a portion of their writing or being interviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kneschke|first=Tristan|title=Don't Judge a Book by its Trailer|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/301723/20120220/book-trailer-video-movie-edit-film-novel.htm|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=International Business Times|date=February 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early book trailers consisted mostly of still images of the book, with some videos incorporating actors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Metz|first=Nina|title=Super Sad Book Trailers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-07-06/features/ct-prj-0708-book-trailers-20120706_1_book-trailers-publishers-videos|publisher=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[John Farris|John Farris's]] book trailer for his 1986 novel ''Wildwood'' incorporating images from the book cover along with actors such as [[John Zacherle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitton|first=Akira|title=TOR Books' WILDWOOD promo|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3OMCNVb7wMM|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, the ''[[School Library Journal]]'' established the Trailie Award for the best book trailers. There are three categories: author/publisher created, student created and librarian/adult created. The award was announced at the ''School Library Journal'' Leadership Summit on the Future of Reading on October 22, 2010 in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SLJ's Trailie Awards Asks Readers to Vote for Their Favorite Book Trailer|url=http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/slj/home/886663-312/sljs_trailie_awards_asks_readers.html.csp|publisher=School Library Journal|accessdate=18 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Dan Rosen and CV Herst established BookReels, a website dedicated to allowing publishers and authors to post book trailers and other multimedia, culminating in the annual BookReels Awards. BookReels lets readers browse and rate trailers, post comments and reviews, join discussion groups, and share BookReel discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BookReels, an MTV for Books?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/digital/content-and-e-books/article/62365-bookreels-an-mtv-for-books.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fan-made trailers ===
For popular movies, fans often make trailers on their own. These are unofficial videos by fans utilizing audio or video of a movie, studio trailer, animation techniques or fan-acted scenes replacing the video of the official trailer.

== MPAA rating cards for theatrical trailers ==
{{Anchor|Rating cards}}
[[File:Redband.JPG|thumb|An example of a red band trailer card, in this case for 2008 ''[[Forgetting Sarah Marshall]]''.]]

The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) mandates that theatrical trailers be no longer than two minutes and thirty seconds.  Each major studio{{clarify|date=February 2013}} is given one exception to this rule per year.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} Internet or home-video trailers have no time restrictions. ''Rating cards'' appear at the head of trailers in the United States which indicate how closely the trailer adheres to the MPAA's standards.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

A ''green band'' is an all-green graphic at the beginning of the trailer.  Until April 2009, these cards indicated that they had been approved for "all audiences" and often included the movie's [[MPAA rating]]. This signified that the trailer adheres to the standards for motion picture advertising outlined by the MPAA, which include limitations on foul language and violent, sexual, or otherwise objectionable imagery. In April 2009, the MPAA began to permit the green band language to say that a trailer had been approved for "appropriate" audiences, meaning that the material would be appropriate for audiences in theaters, based on the content of the film they had come to see. In May 2013, the MPAA changed the trailer approval band from "for appropriate audiences" to "to accompany this feature", but only when accompanying a feature film; for bands not accompanying a feature film, the text of the band remained the same. The font and style of the text on the graphic bands (green and red) was also changed at the time the green band was revised in 2013.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Trailers which do not adhere to these guidelines may be issued a ''red band'', which indicates approval for only "restricted" or "mature" audiences. These trailers may only be shown theatrically before R-rated, NC-17-rated, or unrated movies{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} (only films that are released in theaters rated R and not in theaters{{clarify|date=December 2014}} rated PG-13). These trailers may include nudity, profanity, or other material deemed inappropriate for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Cat-and-Mouse for a Trashy Trailer |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/movies/24kick.html | publisher =New York Times |date=February 23, 2010 |accessdate=2010-02-24 | first=Brooks | last=Barnes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, "yellow band" trailers were introduced around 2007 to indicate restricted content, only for distribution on the Internet. Although official, this practice appears to have never been widespread (although occasional yellow band trailers are created). A notable example is the yellow band trailer for Rob Zombie's ''[[Halloween (2007 film)|Halloween]]'' ([[2007 in film|2007]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David M. |last=Halbfinger |date=13 June 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/movies/13yell.html |title=Attention, Web Surfers: The Following Film Trailer May Be Racy or Graphic |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=E1 |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
Every year there are two main events that give awards to outstanding film trailers: The [[Key Art Awards]], presented by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', and the [[Golden Trailer Awards]]. The Golden Trailer Awards and the Key Art Awards pick winners in all creative parts of film advertising, from trailers and TV spots to posters and print ads. The Golden Trailer Awards are currently expanding to add a sister event, The World Trailer Awards, to be a kickoff to the Cannes Film Festival in France, 2013. The yearly Key Art Awards ceremony is often held at the [[Dolby Theater]] in Hollywood. ''The Film Informant'' also recognizes movie marketing media and held the first annual TFI Awards in early January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 TFI Awards|url=http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|work=2011 Film Informant Awards|publisher=The Film Informant|accessdate=23 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120717025506/http://thefilminformant.com/2011-tfi-awards/|archivedate=17 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site is the first to officially start recognizing and rating movie marketing media on a daily basis.

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

A '''tribal chief''' is the leader of a [[tribe|tribal society]] or [[chiefdom]].

==Description==
Tribal societies with [[social stratification]] under a single (or [[Diarchy|dual]]) leader emerged in the [[Neolithic]] period out of earlier tribal structures with little stratification, and they remained prevalent throughout the [[Iron Age]].

In the case of  [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] tribal societies existing within larger colonial and post-colonial states, tribal chiefs may represent their tribe or ethnicity in a form of [[self-government]].

The most common types are the chairman of a council (usually of "[[Elder (administrative title)|elder]]s") and/or a broader [[popular assembly]] in "parliamentary" cultures, the war chief (may be an alternative or additional post in war time), the hereditary chief, and the politically dominant [[medicineman]] (in "[[theocracy|theocratic]]" cultures).

The term is usually distinct from chiefs at lower levels, such as [[village headman|village chief]] (geographically defined) or [[clan chief]] (an essentially genealogical notion). The descriptive "tribal" requires an ethno-cultural identity (racial, linguistic, religious etc.) as well as some political (representative, legislative, executive and/or judicial) expression. In certain situations, and especially in a [[Colonialism|colonial]] context, the most powerful member of either a [[confederation]] or a [[federation]] of such tribal, clan or village chiefs would be referred to as a [[paramount chief]]. This term has largely fallen out of use, however, and such personages are now often called [[king]]s.

A woman who holds a chieftaincy in her own right or who derives one from her marriage to a male chief has been referred to alternatively as a '''chieftainess''', a '''chieftess''' or, especially in the case of the former, a '''chief'''.

==History==
[[File:Arminius1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arminius]], a chieftain of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] [[Cherusci]] tribe who defeated three [[Roman legions]] in the [[Battle of the Teutoburg Forest]].]]
Anthropologist [[Elman Service]] distinguishes two stages of tribal societies: simple societies organized by limited instances of social rank and prestige, and more stratified societies led by chieftains or tribal kings ([[chiefdom]]s). Historically, tribal societies represent an intermediate stage between the [[band society]] of the [[Paleolithic]] stage and [[civilization]] with centralized, super-regional government based in [[Cities of the Ancient Near East|cities]]. Stratified tribal societies led by tribal kings thus flourished from the [[Neolithic]] stage into the [[Iron Age]], albeit in competition with civilisations and [[empire]]s beginning in the [[Bronze Age]]. 
An important source of information for tribal societies of the Iron Age is [[Greco-Roman ethnography]], which describes tribal societies surrounding the urban, imperialist civilisation of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and [[Roman era|Roman]] periods.

After the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, tribal kingdoms were again established over much of Europe in the wake of the [[Migration period]]. By the [[High Middle Ages]], these had again coalesced into super-regional monarchies.

Tribal societies remained prevalent in much of the [[New World]]. Exceptions to tribal societies outside of Europe and Asia were Paleolithic or Mesolithic band societies in [[Oceania]] and in parts of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Europeans forced centralized governments onto these societies during [[colonialism]], but in some instances tribes have retained or regained partial self-government.

==Modern states or regions providing an organized form of tribal chiefships==

===Arabia===
Arabs, in particular peninsular [[Tribes of Arabia|Arabs]] and nomadic Bedouins, are largely organized in tribes, many of whom have official representatives in governments. Tribal chiefs are known as [[Sheikh]]s, though this term is also sometimes applied as an honorific title to spiritual leaders of Sufism.
===Bolivia===
The [[Afro-Bolivian community|Afro-Bolivian people]], a recognized ethnic constituency of Bolivia, are led by a 
[[Afro-Bolivian monarchy|king]] whose title is also recognized by the Bolivian government.

===Botswana===
In Botswana, the reigning chiefs of the various tribes are legally empowered to serve as advisers to the government as members of the [[Ntlo ya Dikgosi]], the national [[House of Chiefs]]. In addition to this, they also serve as the ex officio chairs of the tribal ''kgotlas'', meetings of all of the members of the tribes, where political and social matters are discussed.

===Canada===
{{main|band government}}
The band is the fundamental unit of governance among the [[First Nations in Canada]] (formerly called "Indians").  Most bands have elected chiefs, either directly elected by all members of the band, or indirectly by the band council, these chiefs are recognized by the Canadian state under the terms of the [[Indian Act]].  As well, there may be traditional hereditary or charismatic chiefs, who are usually not part of the Indian Act-sanctioned formal government.  There were 614 bands in Canada in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 Frequently Asked Questions About Aboriginal Peoples] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922104948/http://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100016202/1100100016204 |date=2013-09-22 }}. Aadnc-aandc.gc.ca (2010-09-15). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  There is also a national organization, the [[Assembly of First Nations]], which elects a "national chief" to act as spokesperson of all First Nations bands in Canada.

===Ghana===
The offices and traditional realms of the chiefs of Ghana are constitutionally protected by the republican constitution of the country. The chiefs serve as custodians of all traditional lands and the cultures of the traditional areas. They also serve as members of the Ghanaian [[National House of Chiefs]].

===Nigeria===
Although the [[Nigerian traditional rulers]] aren't mentioned in Nigeria's current constitution, they derive their powers from various so-called ''Chiefs laws'' and are therefore legally recognized. They usually serve as members of each federating state's [[State Council of Traditional Rulers and Chiefs]].

===Oceania===
The [[Solomon Islands]] have a Local Court Act which empowers chiefs to deal with crimes in their communities, thus assuring them of considerable effective authority.

===Philippines===
Apo Rodolfo Aguilar (Kudol I) serves as the chieftain of the [[Tagbanwa people|Tagbanwa]] tribes people living in Banuang Daan and Cabugao settlements in Coron Island, Palawan, Philippines. His position is recognized by the Filipino government.

===South Africa===
Such figures as the [[king of the Zulu Nation]] and the [[Rain Queen]] are politically recognized in South Africa because they derive their status, not only from tribal custom, but also from the Traditional Leadership Clause of the country's current constitution.

===Uganda===
The pre-colonial states that existed in what is today Uganda were summarily abolished following independence from [[Great Britain]]. However, following constitutional reforms in 1993, a number of them were restored as politically neutral constituencies of the state by the government of [[Yoweri Museveni]]. Such figures as the [[Kabaka of Buganda]] and the [[Omukama of Toro]] typify the Ugandan chieftaincy class.

===United States===
{{further|Tribe (Native American)}}

====Historical cultural differences between tribes====
Generally, a tribe or nation is considered to be part of an [[ethnic group]], usually sharing cultural [[Value (personal and cultural)|value]]s. 
For example, the forest-dwelling [[Chippewa]] historically built dwellings from the bark of trees, as opposed to the [[Great Plains]]-dwelling tribes, who would not have access to trees, except by trade, for example for [[lodgepole pine|lodgepole]]s. Thus, the tribes of the Great Plains might typically dwell in skin-covered [[tipi]]s rather than bark lodges. But some Plains tribes built their lodges of earth, as for example the [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]].{{ref|FieldMuseum}} The [[Pueblo people]], meanwhile, built their dwellings of stone and earth.

====Political power in a tribe====
A chief might be considered to hold all political power, say by oratory or by example. But on the North American continent, it was historically possible to evade the political power of another by migration. The [[Mingo]]s, for example, were [[Iroquois]] who migrated further west to the sparsely populated [[Ohio Country]] during the 18th century. Two Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, [[Hiawatha]] and [[the Great Peacemaker]], formulated a [[Iroquois constitution|constitution]] for the Iroquois Confederation.

The tribes [[Indian Wars|were pacified]] by units of the United States Army in the nineteenth century, and were also subject to forced schooling in the decades afterward. Thus, it is uncommon for today's tribes to have a purely Native American cultural background, and today Native Americans are in many ways simply another ethnicity of the secular American people. Because formal education is now respected, some like [[Peter MacDonald (Navajo leader)|Peter MacDonald]], a Navajo, left their jobs in the mainstream U.S. economy to become chairpeople of their tribal councils or similar self-government institutions.

Not all tribal leaders need be men; [[Wilma Mankiller]] was a well-known Chief of the Cherokee Nation. Also, though the fount of power might be the chief, he or she is typically not free to wield power without the consent of a council of elders of some kind. For example: [[Cherokee]] men were not permitted to go to war without the consent of the council of women.

Tribal government is an official form of government in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://firstgov.gov/Government/State_Local/Tribal_Sites.shtml |title=A-Z Index of Tribal Governments, A &amp;#124; USA.gov |publisher=Firstgov.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in a number of countries around the world.

Historically, the U.S. government treated tribes as seats of political power, and made treaties with the tribes as legal entities. Be that as it may, the territory of these tribes fell under the authority of the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] as reservations held in trust for the tribes. Citizenship was formerly considered a tribal matter. For example, it was not until 1924 that the [[Pueblo people]] were granted U.S. citizenship, and it was not until 1948 that the Puebloans were granted the right to vote in state elections in New Mexico. In Wisconsin, the [[Menominee Nation]] has its own county [[Menominee County, Wisconsin]] with special car license plates; 87% of the county's population is Native American.

Mainstream Americans often find pride and comfort in realizing that at least part of their ethnic ancestry is Native American, although the connection is usually only sentimental and not economic or cultural. Thus, there is some political power in one's ability to claim a Native American connection (as in the [[Black Seminole]]).

====Economic power in a tribe====
Because the Nations were sovereign, with treaty rights and obligations, the Wisconsin tribes innovated [[Indian gaming]] in 1988,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051231031253/http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/dec05/381080.asp]&lt;/ref&gt; that is, on-reservation gambling casinos, which have since become a [[United States dollar|US$]]14&amp;nbsp;billion industry nationwide. This has been imitated in many of the respective states that still have Native American tribes. The money that this generates has engendered some political scandal. For example, the [[Tiwa people|Tigua]] tribe, which fled their ancestral lands in New Mexico during the Pueblo revolt of 1680, and who then settled on land in [[El Paso County, Texas]], has paid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Myers |first=Lisa |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7575874/ |title=4.2 million dollars in political contributions in Texas |publisher=MSNBC |date=2005-04-20 |accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a low probable return to the tribe because of the [[Jack Abramoff]] publicity.

Many of the tribes use professional management for their money. Thus, the [[Mescalero Apache]] renovated their Inn of the Mountain Gods to include gambling as well as the previous tourism, lodging, and skiing in the older Inn.

The Navajo nation defeated bids to open casinos in 1994, but by 2004 the [[Shiprock]] casino was a ''[[fait accompli]]''.

Five-day workshops for galaxy researchers worldwide co-sponsored by UC-HiPACC were held at UCSC in August in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HiPACC Conferences &amp; Workshops|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Conferences.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most recent, in August 2013, was attended by nearly 90 participants from about 30 institutions in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Israel, Korea, Spain, and the United States. Approximately 50 sessions were held over five days. About 85 presenters from around the world conducted sessions on a variety of current concerns in astrophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Santa Cruz Galaxy Workshop|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/GalaxyWorkshop2013.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Summer School in Computational Astrophysics ===

UC-HiPACC supports an annual international advanced school aimed at graduate students and postdocs who are currently working in or actively interested in doing research in AstroComputing. Topics and locations of the annual school rotate among the UC campuses and national laboratories, and  [[Caltech]] and [[Stanford]] also participate. Lectures from summer school sessions are posted on the UC-HiPACC website so that they can be useful worldwide. During these schools, students are afforded direct access to some of the largest supercomputers in the world for running their own simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Summer School on AstroComputing|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/SummerSchool.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2010 Summer School ====

The first UC-HiPACC summer school was held in July 2010 on the campus of UC Santa Cruz where students learned about the main software models currently used in high resolution simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. In labs, students worked on projects using these codes, supervised by the lecturers. The summer school was directed by [http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/dept/html/directory.faculty.aklypin.shtml Anatoly Klypin], [[New Mexico State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 International Summer School on Astro-Computing|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/html/2010SummerSchool_archive.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2011 Summer School ====

In 2011, 28 grad students — 17 from outside California — gathered at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to learn about Explosive Astrophysics. The focus was on computational explosive astrophysics, including the modeling of core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, neutron star mergers, and other energetic transients. Workshops guided students in running and visualizing simulations on supercomputers using codes such as FLASH, CASTRO, GR1D and modules for nuclear burning and radiation transport. The conference was organized by [http://astro.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/kasen.html Daniel Kasen] and [https://archive.is/20140113104528/http://astro.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/nugent.html Peter Nugent] of UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 International Summer School on Astro on AstroComputing|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/html/ISSAC_Home.php|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2012 Summer School ====

Taught from July 9 to 20, 2012, the summer school on the campus of [[UC San Diego]], under the direction of [http://www.sdss.jhu.edu/~szalay/ Alex Szaley], hosted by SDSC Director [https://web.archive.org/web/20070204003044/http://www.sdsc.edu/about/Director.html Michael Norman], taught the next generation of researchers how to deal effectively with the avalanche of data that comes from current astronomical observations. The field of study is called ''AstroInformatics.''  Students were afforded access to the San Diego Supercomputer Center for computational and infrastructure support. Conducted over 10 days, 30 hours of lectures, combined with five hours of post-lecture discussions, and 20 hours of hands-on computation labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2012 International Summer School on AstroInformatics|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/ISSAC2012.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Astroinformatics: 2012 Int'l Summer School on Astrocomputing|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/meetings/all-meetings/astroinformatics-2012-intl-summer|work=Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal|publisher=Penn State|accessdate=11 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2013 Summer School ====

The 2013 AstroComputing Summer School trained future researchers in the use of large-scale simulations in star and planet formation problems. The school covered many of the major public codes in use today, including tutorials and hands-on experience running and analyzing simulations.

=== Education of Public and Other Outreach ===

As UC-HiPACC states on its website, “A crucial goal of UC-HiPACC outreach is to give the fruits of UC computational astrophysics research back to the taxpaying public through formal (classroom) and informal (extracurricular) education.”&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;

Activities include the preparation by UC-HiPACC staff of articles to help astronomers reach classroom students and teachers and collaboration with planetaria, science museums, and other organizations that reach the astronomy-interested general public. Planetarium shows for which UC-HiPACC members have contributed astronomical computations and images include “Life: A Cosmic Story” in the 75-foot dome of the [[Morrison Planetarium]] in [[San Francisco]], and “Deep Space Adventure” in the 71-foot 8000 pixel-across dome of the [[Adler Planetarium]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morrison Planetarium|title=Life, A Cosmic Story, credits tab, Science Data and Simulations |url=http://www.calacademy.org/academy/exhibits/planetarium/life/|publisher=California Academy of Sciences|accessdate=13 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UC-HiPACC staff creates and posts to its website approximately monthly “AstroShorts”—illustrated capsule stories about especially interesting work in computational astronomy around the UC-HiPACC consortium, designed for use in the newsletters of astronomical societies, science clubs, newspapers, or other outlets.&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt; The website’s “Press Room” publishes press releases on computational astronomy from around the UC-HiPACC consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/PressRoom.php|title=HiPACC Press Room |work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A visualization from the Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation, the most detailed cosmological simulation run to date, was narrated in the [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] TV special ''Inside the Milky Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpts from "Inside the Milky Way", produced by National Geographic TV|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/Movies.html#insideMW|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
UC-HiPACC  provided footage from the Bolshoi Simulation to the Icelandic performer [[Björk]] for her musical number “Dark Matter” for her [[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]] concert.&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;

The organization conducts outreach to raise funds to support the activities described in this article.&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;

It was originally written as articles in Dutch for a virtual journal,&lt;ref&gt;[https://thecorrespondent.com/utopia-for-realists/ This book originated on The Correspondent]&lt;/ref&gt; and since compiled and translated into several languages. It offers a [[Critical theory|critical]] proposal that it claims is a practical approach to [[Utopian socialism|reconstructing modern society]] to promote  a more productive and equitable life based an three core ideas:
* a universal and unconditional [[basic income]] paid to [[World population|everybody]]
* a short  [[Work week|working week]] of [[Working time|fifteen-hours]]
* [[open border]]s worldwide with the free exchange of citizens between all nations

==Rationale==
As a result of the advance of [[international trade]] and [[economic science]] in recent decades, globalization has radically transformed the traditional social and economic order from smaller, connected nations to a new [[world economy]] which, while already demonstrably capable of  rescuing  millions of people from poverty, could be extended to the entire human race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Forum_IncGrwth_2017.pdf World Economic Forum Growth Development Index 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the new global system unfairly compensates a [[G20|few rich countries]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd.org/eco/growth/2501905.pdf OECD:Trade Between Developed And Developing Countries': The Decade Ahead]&lt;/ref&gt;  and, with the progressive substitution of [[human capital]]  with [[automation]] and [[robotics]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/01/23/robotics-and-automation-employment-and-aging-baby-boomers/ Robotics and automation, employment, and aging Baby Boomers]&lt;/ref&gt; has also generated an increase in inequality, both between the  [[capitalism|investment community]] and its [[workforce]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epi.org/publication/the-decline-in-labors-share-of-corporate-income-since-2000-means-535-billion-less-for-workers/ EconomicPolicy Institute, 2015:The decline in labor’s share of corporate income]&lt;/ref&gt; within the G20 nations as well as between [[developed country|developed countries]]  and their [[Developing country|developing neighbours]].

==Justification==
Each idea is [[critical theory|supported]] by multiple academic studies and anecdotal evidence including numerous success stories. 
For example, it quotes  
* Richard Nixon's 1968 plan for a basic income for Americans&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2016/05/richard-nixon-ubi-basic-income-welfare/ Jacobin:Nixon’s Basic Income Plan]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Canada|Federal]] project in city of [[Dauphin, Manitoba]] once eradicated poverty&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/12/23/mincome-in-dauphin-manitoba_n_6335682.html Huffington Post;A Canadian City Once Eliminated Poverty And Nearly Everyone Forgot About It]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The perceived success of the [[Schengen Agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://theconversation.com/business-will-suffer-if-border-crossings-between-european-neighbours-are-shut-47022 The Conversation (website): Business will suffer if border crossings between European neighbours are shut]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}

Bregman points out that many imperatives of modern law were once highly controversial proposals, perhaps even abhorrent innovations: 
* [[Abolition of slavery timeline|Abolition of slavery]] 
* [[Women's rights|Emancipation of women]]
* [[LGBT rights by country or territory|Decriminalization of homosexuality]]

The author finally tries to provide a critical balance between [[Socialism|socialist]] ideals of caring and sharing, the [[Conservatism|conservative]] impetus of directive leadership, and [[Liberalism|liberal]] concepts of equality and freedom. He claims there are proven solutions waiting to be implemented, lacking only political courage and financial backing.

'''''Velificatio''''' is a stylistic device used in [[Roman art|ancient Roman art]] to frame a [[List of Roman deities|deity]] by means of a billowing garment. It represents "vigorous movement," an [[theophany|epiphany]],&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rehak, ''Imperium and Cosmos: Augustus and the Northern Campus Martius'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2006), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; or "the vault of heaven," often appearing with celestial, weather, or sea deities.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Turcan, ''Les religions de l'Asie dans la vallée du Rhône'' (Brill, 1972), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is characteristic of the [[iconography]] of the [[Aura (mythology)|Aurae]], the Breezes [[personification|personified]], and one of the elements which distinguish representations of Luna, the Roman [[Moon goddess|goddess of the Moon]], alluding to her astral course.&lt;ref&gt;Stefania Sorrenti, "Les représentations figurées de Jupiter Dolichénien à Rome," in ''La terra sigillata tardo-italica decorata del Museo nazionale romano'', «L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1999), p. 370.&lt;/ref&gt;

A figure so framed is a '''''velificans''''' (plural '''''velificantes'''''). Not all deities are portrayed as ''velificantes'', but the device might be used to mark a member of the [[Roman Emperor|Imperial family]] who had been divinized (a [[Divus|''divus'' or ''diva'']]).&lt;ref&gt;Lise Vogel, ''The Column of Antoninus Pius'' (Harvard University Press, 1973), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Velificatio'' is a frequent device in Roman art,&lt;ref&gt;Hélène Walter, ''La Porte Noire de Besançon'' (Presses Univ. Franche-Comté, 1984), vol. 1, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; including painting, [[mosaic]], [[relief]], and [[Roman sculpture|sculpture]], though it poses technical difficulties for freestanding sculpture. The Athenian sculptor [[Praxiteles]] was able to achieve it.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 36.29; Davide Stimilli, ''The Face of Immortality: Physiognomy and Criticism'' (State University of New York Press, 2005), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is also used to describe [[Hellenistic art]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway, ''Hellenistic Sculpture II: The Styles of ca. 200–100 B.C.'' (University of Wisconsin Press, 2000), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6Jj6rcIup4C&amp;pg=PA124&amp;dq=velificatio+OR+velificantes+OR+velificans&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=c5ZJTYfmBIKClAez4ZXYDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=velificatio%20OR%20velificantes%20OR%20velificans&amp;f=false passim.]''&lt;/ref&gt; The device continued to be used in later [[Western art history|Western art]], in which it is sometimes described as an ''aura'', "a breeze that blows from either without or from within that lifts the veil to reveal the face of an otherwise invisible being."&lt;ref&gt;The term is so used in the art criticism of [[Walter Benjamin]]; Aleida Assmann and Jan Assmann, "Air From Other Planets Blowing: The Logic of Authenticity and the Prophet of the Aura," in ''Mapping Benjamin: The Work of Art in the Digital Age'' (Stanford University Press, 2003), pp. 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage and examples==
In [[classical Latin]], the [[abstract noun]] ''velificatio'' is uncommon,&lt;ref&gt;It occurs in [[Cicero]], ''Ad familiares'' 1.9.21, and not again in Latin literature until Fronto, 267,4–5; Michel P.J. van den Hout, ''A Commentary on the Letters of M. Cornelius Fronto'' (Brill, 1999), p. 608.&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to the act of setting sail, from ''velum'', "sail" (but also "cloth, garment, veil") and the ''-fic-'' combining element from ''-ficio, -ficere'' (= ''facio, facere'', "do, make"). The verbal form was the basis for modern scholarly usage. [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] describes ''[[Aura (mythology)|Aurae]] velificantes sua veste'', the Breezes "making a sail with their own garment"&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], ''Natural History'' 36.29.&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Porticus Octaviae]] ("[[Portico]] of [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]]").&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Köves-Zulauf, "Plinius d. Ä. und die römische Religion," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.16.1 (1978), p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Such depictions of the Aurae are known from extant Roman art, and have been used as comparative material to identify the pair of ''velificantes'' in a scene from the [[Ara Pacis|Augustan Altar of Peace]]. On the basis of a passage from the ''[[Carmen Saeculare]]'' of [[Horace]], composed and performed for [[Augustus]]'s staging of the [[Saecular Games]] in 17 BC, the central figure is often identified as Tellus (Earth):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fertile in produce and cattle, let Tellus grant Ceres a crown of grain; let the healthful waters and breezes of Jove nourish offspring.&lt;ref&gt;''Fertilis frugum pecorisque Tellus / spicea donet Cererem corona; / nutriant fetus et aquae salubres / et Iovis aurae''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not all scholars agree on this analysis of the scene. The creatures on which the ''velificantes'' are seated also suggest [[Nereids]], and the reference may point to the [[Cult of the Nymphs]].&lt;ref&gt;Babette Stanley Spaeth, "The Goddess Ceres in the Ara Pacis Augustae and the Carthage Relief," ''American Journal of Archaeology'' 98 (1994), pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of the veil is sometimes explained in terms of the [[initiation rite]]s of the [[mystery religions]]. Initiates wore drapery or a veil which was lifted by a priestess. The veil was a symbol of death, and its removal in the rite signified the initiate's rebirth. The ''velificatio'' thus appears in scenes on [[sarcophagi]] and in other [[funerary art]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Matelli, "Hieronymous in Athens and Rhodes", in ''Lyco of Troas and Hieronymous of Rhodes'' (Transaction Publishers, 2004), pp. 294–295.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of ''velificantes''==
The ''velificatio'' motif may be found with numerous deities, divine beings, and ''divi'', including:&lt;ref&gt;Unless otherwise noted, the following examples are given by Babette Stanley Spaeth, ''The Roman Goddess Ceres'' (University of Texas Press, 1996), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;
