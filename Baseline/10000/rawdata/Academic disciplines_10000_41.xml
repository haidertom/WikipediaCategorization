'''AYNI Social Lab''' is the social innovation laboratory of the [[Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion of Peru]]. It was created in October 2016 to promote the generation of cost-effective [[innovations]] for [[social policy]], through the identification and implementation of innovative solutions aimed at improving the quality of life of the population in conditions of [[poverty]] or [[vulnerability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In addition to the specialists and the technical team of the AYNI Lab Social, the "Working Group" is the one which has the responsibility of guiding all its activities. This group is made up of: the Deputy Minister of Social Policy and Evaluation (President of the team), the Deputy Minister of Social Benefits, the Director General of Quality Management of Social Programs, the Director General of Articulation or Coordination of Social Benefits, the Director General of Monitoring and Evaluation, the Director of Evaluation, and the Head of the Planning and Investment Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The AYNI Lab Social seeks to facilitate the development of social innovations that are original, transferable and reproducible, capable of being transformed into policies, cost-effective, and scalable.{{fact|date=September 2017}} In this context, the development of both institutional and technological innovations are being addressed. A good deal of institutional innovations make use of insights from [[behavioral economics]] and [[psychology]] to achieve cost-effective mechanisms and solutions;{{fact|date=September 2017}}  moreover, all these seek to be evaluated using experimental methodologies and [[impact evaluation]]. As for the technological innovations, these have been addressed on the basis of the open calls "Competitions of Social Innovations", promoted jointly with the [[Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion of Peru]], the [[Ministry of Production of Peru]] and [[Innóvate Perú]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

An '''adventure park''' is a place which can contain a wide variety of elements, such as rope climbing exercises, obstacle courses and zip-lines. They are usually intended for recreation.

"Recreational-oriented" adventure parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors. They do not follow a specific educational concept, but see the individual, physical and mental challenge as a predominantly recreational activity. Neither climbing techniques nor special/specific physical fitness experience are necessary. Typical slogans are: ''Have Fun, Test your Courage, Overcome your Own Fears, Be Outside, Be in the Nature, Do some Physical Activities, etc.''

== History ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 2.jpg|thumb|Treetop Adventure Park in Bali|]]
[[File:Adventure Park, Ashramam, Kollam.jpg|thumb|right|[[Adventure Park, Kollam|Asramam Adventure Park]], [[Kollam]], [[Kerala]]]]
It is unclear where and when the first ropes course was created. A ropes course was built in 1875 in France and functioned mainly as a physical challenge activity for the participants. During the Second World War, ropes courses were used as obstacle courses for improving the physical fitness of the British military.

In the mid-1960s, ropes courses became a central component of outdoor seminars in the United States.

In recent years, specifically recreation-oriented Adventure Parks were developed. The market has boomed especially in Europe &amp; Asian countries.

== Related Outdoor Activities ==
As already mentioned, a [[ropes course]] is often a challenging outdoor personal development and team-building activity with a relatively low number of participants. Some parks offer both - a recreational section and a team building section.

A [[canopy tour]] is a specific type of [[ziplining]] where a person is harnessed to a steel cable and propelled by gravity from platform to platform high up in the trees of a thick forest canopy. Although these date back far into history for civil and even scientific uses, they are now used for recreation and have created a new activity for the tourism industry.

== Facts &amp; Figures Adventure Parks ==
The category Adventure Parks can be broken down into a huge variety of specific types. They differ according to the following main criteria:
* Type of parks: 	 	        stationary / mobile
* Structural System:                  trees / poles / buildings / metallic structure
* Target visitors:                       all / kids from 4 years old / disabled
* Height of the lifeline: 	        "mid-height", "out of reach"
* Belay system: 		        self / permanent / continuous
* Locations:			        touristic / urban

[[image:Hochseilgarten Isselburg.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park on Poles]]
[[File:Indoor-Kletterpark.jpg|thumb|Indoor Adventure Park in Shopping Mall]]Forest Adventure Parks are very popular. They take advantage of the beauty of a forest, of the trees (no investment in poles) and offer an outdoor activity surrounded by nature. They offer not only an adventure “at height” in a forest, but also the benefit for customers of experiencing the spectacular natural beauty of trees, hills, cliffs and/or rivers. In forest parks, there is a particular focus on tree-friendly installation. In most cases, the platforms are held to the trees through the principle of friction. When the exercise elements are mounted, the trees are protected by coats of wood or rubber to prevent rubbing from the ropes.

Depending on how they are used and where they are located, parks on poles are an excellent alternative. They offer complete freedom in terms of park design and location but, at the same time, require higher investment (in the poles). The heat of the summer can be a challenge. A mix of poles/trees at the edge of a forest has the potential to work well.
 
Indoor parks have the great advantage of being an “all year round” operation but with the corresponding weakness of that strength at times when fine weather encourages outdoor activities. These trails are often built on a modular metallic structure. New parks on wood poles have shown that an indoor park can also provide a good experience.

Adventure Parks can be found in a multitude of places/locations. Examples of trends:
*	Close to large tourist destinations
*	In Ski Resorts as an attraction during summer months (a boom in Switzerland and several European countries)
*	In Amusement Parks, Holiday Clubs/Villages, Hotel Club and Resorts, etc.
*	Urban parks or close to conglomerations (e.g. the park in the center of Lyon, France)
*	Close to a significant pool of potential customers, such as a large Shopping Mall, Zoo, Campsite, etc.
*	Small (kids) parks for shopping malls (as indoor), city events, etc.

Large Adventure Parks usually have several trails of increasing difficulty levels and can reach up to 10 trails. With 10 to 20 acrobatic elements per trail, the park can easily reach up to 200 elements (it is usually between 40 and 200 elements).

The majority of trails are for everyone from the age of 7 years old (sometimes 10). The difficulty level starts at a low level or “green trail” and progresses to a very challenging level or “black trail”. Specific trails for kids from 4 years are very popular with families and provide a boost to the business (up to 20-30% more clients). Sometimes there are specific trails for the disabled.

Most kids love Adventure Parks. In a park they can act independently, try and fail and try again, and overcome their own fears without any risk (a continuous belay system is strongly recommended). Thanks the variety of levels, each time they can push their own boundaries and reach their own challenges. This is a perfect outdoor activity (with individual, physical and mental challenges) to learn through play.

The acrobatic elements are artificial obstacles (exercises) made from ropes, nets and wood in various forms, and which are installed at different heights in trees. The clever arrangement of such obstacles encourages many basic forms of movement such as climbing, hand over hand, balancing, holding, slipping and sliding. A good mix of elements and [[zip-line]]s increases the diversity and interest of parks – People love zip-lines.

There are two approaches to how to structure a park: (1) the so-called French approach where you move from one trail to the next one, like setting out on a trip and coming back to the start or (2) more the Swiss approach with one common starting point (often a platform) where the visitors can choose anytime which trail they want to go. The latter approach has the great advantage to be self-distributing and therefore allowing higher throughput by peak.

[[File:Capture d’écran 2012-06-12 à 14.09.01.jpg|thumb|Adventure Park with lifeline "out of reach"]]
There are 2 schools concerning the height of the lifeline:
*The more traditional approach, frequently seen on continental Europe, is the lifeline at mid-height. This height at {{convert|1.40|-|1.60|m|ft|abbr=on}} is well adapted for carabiners.
*The lifeline out of reach, at {{convert|2|-|2.30|m|ft|abbr=on}}, possible with continuous belay system, is more frequent in UK and shows several advantages:  (1) ''Higher throughput by peaks'' - up to 20% more (No manipulation on platforms and therefore gains of time - No need to install additional trolley for the ziplines).  (2) ''More impressive and challenging elements''  (No "mid-heigh" cables to help the visitors - Impressive and when necessary, the visitor can anytime help himself with the lanyard - Impressive and without risk of numerous rescues).  (3) ''Higher convenience for the park visitors''  (Platforms are free of any "mid-heigh" cable, ease for the visitors - Fun &amp; thrills on elements while relaxing on platforms).  (4) ''Much lower risk of injury''  (No contact with safety device - As the lanyard is already tighter, the distance of possible fall will be shorter)

Concerning the safety, traditionally a self-safety system is used where participants take responsibility for themselves. Before starting, the participants receive special training in how to use the safety equipment and then run the various trails independently. The emergence of new technologies has drastically increased the level of safety and opened new business opportunities.

== Safety systems ==
[[image:Seilpark Gantrisch - 03.jpg|thumb|Self belay with carabiners]]
[[File:Rheinfall Seilpark 4.jpg|thumb|Continuous Belay for Kids Trails from 4 years old]]
The safety equipment for each participant basically consists of a harness, a lanyard and a belay system (another option would simply be a net under the trails – relatively expensive and with limited application). Sometimes helmets are also used.

There are distinctions between the following main four belay systems:
* Self belay with carabiners
* Permanent belay with carabiners
* Continuous belay on rail
* Continuous belay on cable (with a hook or a trolley)

The traditional self-belay system basically consists of two carabiners operated by the participants. The participants successively unlock/lock the connection of the carabiners on each platform (zone of risk). Mishandling and removal of both carabiners at the same time will cause complete unlocking. This situation could mean a life-threatening risk and there have been instances of serious accidents and even terminal injuries.

The permanent belay systems significantly reduce the risk of accident. The two carabiners have a "communicating system” which avoids simultaneous opening of the carabiners and the complete unlocking from the cable. A permanent system with integrated rollers can even be found.

The continuous belay systems on rail offer a high level of safety but has limited application – it is mainly on poles with a heavy structure, for relatively short elements and it is expensive (and more common in the USA than in Europe).

With a continuous belay system on cable, visitors are continuously connected to the lifeline (cable) from the start to the finish without any possibility of becoming unlocked - which provides the highest safety level. At the start of the trail, the visitors simply connect the lifeline into the belay device (hook or trolley) and they can run the whole trail – in term of safety, no specific further action is required. 
For the continuous belay system with integrated trolley, the belay device simply rolls along the whole lifeline and greatly eases the passage on zip-lines (no handling required). This last technology is the only system allowing the lifeline to be “out of reach” which has numerous advantages (higher throughput, more impressive elements, more convenience, lower risk of injury)

== Adventure Parks Operation ==
[[File:Bali Seilpark 3.jpg|thumb|Round Platform]]
Recreational-oriented Adventure Parks are usually designed for a larger volume of visitors: In Europe 10,000 to 60,000 or even more participants per season are common (usually April to October) and often with a high variation pattern (high attendance on weekends and during vacations).

The key challenges are manifold: attractive value proposition, pool of potential clients, safety level &amp; risk management, needs of training &amp; supervision and flexible operation.

In order to ensure a profitable and sustainable operation, meeting the last three challenges is essential. The new technologies in safety systems bring Adventure Parks into a new era by dramatically reducing the risk of accident (permanent and continuous systems) and reducing the needs of training and supervision (continuous systems).

The EN 15567-1 and -2 standards regulate the construction and operation of high ropes Courses / Adventure Parks. The various associations as ERCA and IAPA in Europe or ACCT and PRCA in the USA are acting towards professionalization of the industry.

'''AgroParisTech''' (officially [[French language|French]] ''Institut des sciences et industries du vivant et de l'environnement'', or ''Paris Institute of Technology for Life, Food and Environmental Sciences'')&lt;ref&gt;English naming according to [http://www.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/AgroParisTech_brochure_ENGLISH.pdf English brochure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209013409/http://www.agroparistech.fr/IMG/pdf/AgroParisTech_brochure_ENGLISH.pdf |date=2008-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a French university-level institution, also known as a "[[Grande Ecole]]". It was founded on January 1, 2007, by the merger of three life sciences [[grandes écoles]].

Leader in life sciences and agronomy, AgroParisTech is one of the foremost and most prestigious Grandes Ecoles. AgroParisTech is one of the founding members of the [[Université Paris-Saclay]], which will be the largest European multidisciplinary campus. AgroParisTech will consequently be moving to the [[Paris-Saclay]] [[business cluster| business]] and [[research-intensive cluster| research-intensive]] cluster in 2018.

AgroParisTech is a member of the [[UniverSud Paris]] and the [[Paris Institute of Technology]] (or Paris Tech). The latter is a consortium of ten graduate institutes of science and engineering. AgroParisTech is also part of 'The Life and Environmental Science and Technology Hub' of the [[Paris]] region, together with [[Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique|INRA]], [[Cemagref]], [[AFSSA]], the [[Ecole nationale vétérinaire d'Alfort]], and the [[Versailles National School of Landscape architecture]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}


== History==
AgroParisTech is the merger of three graduate institutes of science and engineering located around [[Paris]]:
* ''[[Institut National Agronomique Paris-Grignon|Institut national agronomique Paris-Grignon]]'' (INA P-G), founded in 1826
* [[French National School of Forestry|''École nationale du génie rural, des eaux et des forêts'']] (ENGREF), founded in 1964
* ''[[École Nationale Supérieure des Industries Agricoles et Alimentaires|École nationale supérieure des industries agricoles et alimentaires]]'' (ENSIA), founded in 1893.

The public higher education system in France includes universities and other institutions called the “[[Grandes Ecoles]]”. The “Grandes Ecoles” are the best rated pathways for higher education in Engineering and Management. The vast majority of the chief executives in major French companies and of top managers in the French Administration are graduates from the “Grandes Ecoles”. The features are:
* A very selective admission process through which students are either admitted by a nationwide entrance exam (notably after two or three years of “[[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|prépas]]”) or by the virtue of excellent academic records;
* 5 years (Master’s degrees) to 8 years (PhD and post-Master’s degrees) of higher education;
* The degree course at the “Grandes Ecoles” includes compulsory internships in laboratories and companies, in France or abroad
* The prestige of the “Grandes Ecoles” and  contacts with major enterprises provide an easy access to the job market.

==Organization==
AgroParisTech is organized into five departments:
* Agronomy, Forestry, Water and Environmental Science and Technology,
* Life Science and Health,
* Science and Engineering for Food and Bioproducts,
* Social science, Economics and Management,
* Modeling: Mathematics, Informatics and Physics

The '''Arbor Day Foundation''' is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit conservation and education organization founded in 1972 in [[Nebraska]], [[United States]], by John Rosenow. It is the largest nonprofit membership organization dedicated to tree planting.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://panro.org/nonprofitdescriptions.html ''Nonprofit Descriptions'': Arbor Day Foundation]". Professional Association of Nonprofit Reforestation Organizations. panro.org. Retrieved 2017-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation's stated corporate mission is "to inspire people to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees."&lt;ref name="ADF-About"&gt;"[https://www.arborday.org/generalinfo/about.cfm About the Arbor Day Foundation]". Arbor Day Foundation. arborday.org. Retrieved 2017-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Foundation programs are supported by members, donors, and corporate sponsors that share the same vision of a healthier and greener world.&lt;ref name="ADF-About"/&gt;

==History of Arbor Day==
{{see also|Arbor Day#Origins|Arbor Day#United States}}
In 1872, [[Julius Sterling Morton|J. Sterling Morton]] started what would become Arbor Day in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]], [[Nebraska]]. This "holiday" is meant to recognize and support the planting of trees. Morton and his wife Caroline challenged people around the country to plant trees.  In 1872, on the first Arbor Day, approximately one million trees were planted in Nebraska alone. Sterling and Caroline Morton lived in Nebraska City on a 72-acre estate, which is now known as '''[[Arbor Lodge State Historical Park and Arboretum]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arbordayfarm.org/] "Arbor Day Farm", Retrieved 2015-10-21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lied Lodge &amp; Conference Center and Arbor Day Farm==
In Nebraska City, Nebraska, the home of Arbor Day, the Arbor Day Foundation built the Lied Lodge and Conference Center, which houses a full service meeting center and 140 guest rooms"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[http://www.liedlodge.org/] "Lied Lodge and Conference Center", Retrieved 2015-10-21&lt;/ref&gt; for conservation-minded organizations, members, forestry professionals, or other individuals that value the environmental operating practices offered by the facility.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The property is also home to Arbor Day Farm, a National Historic Landmark and an educational visitor attraction; Arbor Day Farm Tree Adventure, including the Lied Greenhouse, Woodland Pavilion, the Tree House Trail, Canopy Tree House, Nature Explore Classrooms, Exploratory Trail, Nature Explore Club Cabin, and the Tree Adventure Discovery Ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2014 |title=Lied Lodge and Conference Center, Arbor Day Farm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Arbor Day Foundation took over management of [[Arbor Lodge State Historical Park and Arboretum]] from the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Marek |first=Anthony |date=2014|title=Arbor Day Foundation and Nebraska Game and Parks Commission Reach Cooperative Agreement to Manage Arbor Lodge State Historical Park |url=http://www.arborday.org/|location=Nebraska City, NE|publisher=Arbor Day Foundation|access-date=2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs of the Arbor Day Foundation==

===Tree City USA===

[[Image:Tree City USA.png|thumb|122px|Tree City USA logo]]
The Tree City USA program, which is co-sponsored by the [[National Association of State Foresters]] and the [[USDA Forest Service]], has grown to include more than 3,400 towns, cities, and military bases in all 50 states.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2014 |title=2014 Annual Report of the Arbor Day Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This program nationally recognizes cities and towns for urban and community forestry and helps provide assistance and public attention to showcase the importance of urban forestry.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2014 |title=Arbor Day Special Edition Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation encourages communities across the nation to become Tree City USA by meeting four standards:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2009 |title=Tree City Bulletin #22 Tree City USA: Foundation for Better Tree Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The community must have a tree board or department.
* The community must have established a community ordinance for [[tree care]].
* There must be a community forestry program with an annual budget of at least $2 per capita.
* The community must have an Arbor Day observance and proclamation.

===Trees for America&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2015 |title=Plant Trees for America}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The million members of the Arbor Day Foundation share the same vision to plant, nurture, and celebrate trees.  The trees planted by the members at their homes, businesses, and ranches provide cleaner air and water, shade, increased stormwater management, energy savings, soil protection, and habitat for wildlife.

Members are invited to receive 10 free trees through the Trees for America program.  Between six and seven million trees are sent to members each year that help improve their communities and environment.

Another aspect of the Trees for America program is the Community Tree Recovery program, which brings hope and healing to communities in need by providing trees to replant after natural disasters.

===Replanting Our National Forests&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;===

Through partnerships with the [[U.S. Forest Service]] and the National Association of State Foresters, Foundation corporate sponsors and members have planted more than 45 million trees in America's National Forests to help restore vitality and life to the forest land after devastation to the forests caused by insects, disease, and wildfires.  Forests provide more than beauty to the nation, they provide drinking water to 180 million people, stop erosion around streams and lakes, and assist rain and snowmelt to soak into the soil.  Trees also help mitigate climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide and replacing it with oxygen.  The replanted forests provide a home to wolves, bald eagles, grizzly bears, and other endangered species.

An example of a forest replanting is the [[Shasta-Trinity National Forest]], the largest national forest in California with two million acres.  The summer of 2008 marked the worst fire season in the history of the forest and burned thousands of acres. Through the Replanting Our National Forest program, the Arbor Day Foundation with their partnership with the U.S. Forest Service, has planted more than one million trees to bring life back to the forest and ensure that it continues to thrive.

===Nature Explore&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;===

Daily interactions with the natural world is a big benefit for children. The Arbor Day Foundation's Nature Explore program allows children to make deeper connections with the natural world.

Through a collaboration with Dimensions Educational Research Foundation, the Arbor Day Foundation is taking on the challenge of teaching the importance of nature to children and exposing them to the outdoors through their Nature Explore Classrooms.  These research-based opportunities for learning are taught to school administrators, landscape architects, and families and give educators an opportunity to build and certify a Nature Explore Outdoor Classroom using safe, durable, natural components.  Outdoor classrooms allow children to learn and play outside while they experience the wonder of nature.  There are art stations with pine cones and acorns, allowing children to create their own masterpieces.  Logs allow a natural climb and crawl experience.  Above-ground gardens allow the children to plant flowers and vegetables and watch them grow.  In this nature-based environment, children are allowed to play together, pretending, creating, and learning to care for the space that was built just for them.  These nature-rich environments help kids connect to nature, inspiring the next generation of tree planters.

===Tree Campus USA&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;===

237 colleges and universities are recognized as Tree Campus USA's. Tree Campus USA recognition is obtained by having a program in place that manages the campus tree inventory along with tree care and maintenance.  Managed trees provide beauty to the campus along with a place for students to study, relax, and socialize. Students that have an opportunity to connect with trees and the environment when they are young will carry this on through their lifetime.

===Rain Forest Rescue&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|date=2015 |title=Shade Grown Arbor Day Specialty Coffee}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

The Arbor Day Foundation's Rain Forest Rescue program saves thousands of acres of tropical rain forest each year with contributions from our generous members and sponsors.  This tropical land is crucial to our survival and is home to many of the rarest animals on earth and plants that hold medicinal value and cures.  Working with eight different countries and 59 different projects, preservation, tree-planting, and recovery is under way with on-location partners.

Shade-grown Arbor Day Specialty Coffee is another part of the Rain Forest Rescue program.  The rain forests are not only home to many animals, they are home to millions of people.  Through the Arbor Day Specialty Coffee program, the Foundation helps these people and farmers save and preserve the rain forest using sustainable agroforestry that includes production of coffee beans. Farmers grow coffee plants in the rain forest under the trees, offering a superior coffee bean and saving the rain forest from unwanted destruction.  The Foundation offers education and economic incentives for rain forest restoration and preservation.

===Conservation Trees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arbor Day Foundation|title=2014 Conservation Trees}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

Land conservation practices help conserve soil, water, wildlife, and the atmosphere.  Through the Conservation Trees program, the Foundation works with ranchers, farmers, and landowners through communication and education encouraging environmental stewardship.

Trees planted for conservation are “working trees.”  They provide many benefits in communities and rural areas.  Other than reducing soil erosion, cleaning waterways and air, trees cut energy costs and sequester carbon dioxide.  They provide beauty to our land all the while providing food for wildlife and people.

===Energy-Saving Trees&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;===

Strategically planting trees in a homeowner's yard lowers utility bills, conserves energy, and lowers peak electricity demand.  The Foundation's Energy-Saving Trees program works with utility partners to plant trees in residential areas.  An on-line tools allows the homeowner to choose a tree for their yard, plot the tree in their yard using satellite imagery to calculate the energy savings over time.  This unique program allows Foundation partners and members to save energy through tree planting.

'''Arne Dekke Eide Næss''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑr|n|ə|_|ˈ|n|ɛ|s}} {{respell|AR|nə|_|NESS}}; {{IPA-no|ˈnɛsː|lang}}; 27 January 1912 &amp;ndash; 12 January 2009) was a Norwegian philosopher who coined the term "[[deep ecology]]" and was an important intellectual and inspirational figure within the [[Environmentalism|environmental movement]] of the late twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C. |title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–30 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/775562345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Næss cited [[Rachel Carson]]'s 1962 book ''[[Silent Spring]]'' as being a key influence in his vision of deep ecology.  Næss combined his ecological vision with Gandhian [[nonviolence]] and on several occasions participated in [[direct action]].

Næss averred that while western environmental groups of the early [[post-war]] period had raised public awareness of the environmental issues of the time, they had largely failed to have insight into and address what he argued were the underlying cultural and philosophical background to these problems. Naess believed that the [[environmental crisis]] of the twentieth century had arisen due to certain unspoken philosophical presuppositions and attitudes within modern western developed societies which remained unacknowledged.&lt;ref name="luke"/&gt;

He thereby distinguished between what he called ''deep'' and ''shallow'' ecological thinking. In contrast to the prevailing utilitarian pragmatism of western businesses and governments, he advocated that a true understanding of nature would give rise to a point of view that appreciates the value of [[biological diversity]], understanding that each living thing is dependent on the existence of other creatures in the complex web of interrelationships that is the natural world.&lt;ref name="luke"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luke |first=Timothy W. |title=Deep ecology: Living as if nature mattered |journal=Organization &amp; Environment |date=June 2002 |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=178–186 |doi= 10.1177/10826602015002005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==
Næss was born in Slemdal, Oslo, Norway, the son of Christine (Dekke) and Ragnar Eide Næss.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.boslekt.com/html/fam291xx/fam29101.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Næss was the youngest person to be appointed full professor at the [[University of Oslo]] and the only professor of philosophy in the country at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C.|title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–530 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/775562345 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a noted mountaineer, who in 1950 led the expedition that made the first ascent of [[Tirich Mir]] (7,708&amp;nbsp;m). The Tvergastein hut in the [[Hallingskarvet]] massif played an important role in Ecosophy T, as "T" is said to represent his mountain hut Tvergastein.&lt;ref&gt;Arne Naess 1989, ''Ecology Community and Lifestyle'', (trans) David Rothenberg, CUP, Cambridge, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, he founded the interdisciplinary journal of philosophy ''[[Inquiry: An Interdisciplinary Journal of Philosophy|Inquiry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C.|title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=527–530 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arnenass28aug2003.jpg|thumb|Professor Arne Næss campaigning for the Norwegian Green party in 2003]]
In 1970, together with a large number of protesters, he chained himself to rocks in front of [[Mardalsfossen]], a waterfall in a Norwegian [[fjord]], and refused to descend until plans to build a dam were dropped. Though the demonstrators were carried away by police and the dam was eventually built, the demonstration launched a  more activist phase of Norwegian environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;J. Seed, J. Macy, P. Flemming, A. Naess, ''Thinking like a mountain: towards a council of all beings'', Heritic Books (1988), {{ISBN|0-946097-26-7}}, {{ISBN|0-86571-133-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, he won the [[Swedish Academy Nordic Prize]], known as the 'little Nobel'. In 2005 he was decorated as a Commander with Star of the [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav]] for socially useful work. Næss was a minor political candidate for the [[Miljøpartiet De Grønne|Norwegian Green Party]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssb.no/emner/00/01/10/stortingsvalg/tab-2005-10-27-18.html |title=Storting Election 2005.

==Philosophy==
Næss' ''[[Erkenntnis und wissenschaftliches Verhalten]]'' (1936) anticipated many themes familiar in post-war analytic philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hannay, Alastair |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1995 |page=627 |isbn=0-19-866132-0 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Næss' main philosophical work from the 1950s was entitled "Interpretation and Preciseness". This was an application of [[set theory]] to the problems of language interpretation, extending the work of semanticists such as [[Charles Kay Ogden]] in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]''. A simple way of explaining it is that any given utterance (word, phrase, or sentence) can be considered as having different potential interpretations, depending on prevailing language norms, the characteristics of particular persons or groups of users, and the language situation in which the utterance occurred. These differing interpretations are to be formulated in more precise language represented as subsets of the original utterance. Each subset can, in its turn, have further subsets (theoretically ad infinitum). The advantages of this conceptualisation of interpretation are various. It enables systematic demonstration of possible interpretation, making possible evaluation of which are the more and less "reasonable interpretations". It is a logical instrument for demonstrating language vagueness, undue generalisation, conflation, pseudo-agreement and effective communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Eriksson |first=Darek |title=Phenomeno-semantic complexity: A proposal for an alternative notion of complexity as a foundation for the management of complexity in human affairs |journal=Complexity and Organization |year=2007 |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=11–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Næss developed a simplified, practical textbook embodying these advantages, entitled ''Communication and Argument'', which became a valued introduction to this pragmatics or "language logic", and was used over many decades as a ''[[sine qua non]]'' for the preparatory examination at the [[University of Oslo]], later known as "Examen Philosophicum" ("Exphil").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C W |title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal= Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=528 |doi=10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recommendations for public debate===
''Communication and Argument'' included his recommendations for objective public debate.  Næss argued for adhering to the following rules to make discussions as fruitful and pleasant as possible:
# '''Avoid tendentious irrelevance'''&lt;br&gt;Examples: Personal attacks, claims of opponents' motivation, explaining reasons for an argument.
# '''Avoid tendentious quoting'''&lt;br&gt;Quotes should not be edited regarding the subject of the debate.
# '''Avoid tendentious ambiguity'''&lt;br&gt;Ambiguity can be exploited to support criticism.
# '''Avoid tendentious use of [[Straw man|straw men]]'''&lt;br&gt;Assigning views to the opponent that he or she does not hold.
# '''Avoid tendentious statements of fact'''&lt;br&gt;Information put forward should never be untrue or incomplete, and one should not withhold relevant information.
# '''Avoid tendentious tone of presentation'''&lt;br&gt;Examples: irony, sarcasm, pejoratives, exaggeration, subtle (or open) threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krabbe |first=Erik C W |title=Arne Næss (1912-2009) |journal=Argumentation |year=2010 |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=529 |doi= 10.1007/s10503-010-9188-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For many years these points were part of two compulsory courses in [[philosophy]] taught in Norwegian universities ("Examen philosophicum" and "Examen facultatum").

===Ecosophy T===
'''Ecosophy T''', as distinct from deep ecology, was originally the name of his personal philosophy. Others such as [[Warwick Fox]] have interpreted deep ecology as a commitment to [[ecosophy]] T, Næss's personal beliefs. The T referred to Tvergastein, a mountain hut where he wrote many of his books, and reflected Næss's view that everyone should develop his own philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Bookchin, Graham Purchase, Brian Morris, Rodney Aitchtey, Robert Hart, Chris Wilbert, ''Deep Ecology and Anarchism'', Freedom Press (1993) {{ISBN|0-900384-67-0}}.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a very rich and complex philosophy, Næss's [[ecosophy]] can be summed up as having Self-realization as its core. According to Næss, every being, whether [[human]], [[animal]], or [[vegetable]] has an equal right to live and to blossom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Næss |first=Arne |title=Ecology, community and lifestyle |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1989}} pp. 164-65&lt;/ref&gt; Through this capitalized Self, Næss emphasizes, in distinction to realization of man’s narrow selves, the realization of our selves as part of an [[Earth's spheres|ecospheric]] whole. It is in this whole that our true ecological Self can be realized. Practically Self-realization for Næss means that, if one does not know how the outcomes of one's actions will affect other beings, one should not act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Luke |first=Timothy |title=Deep ecology: Living as if nature mattered |journal=Organization and Environment |date=June 2002 |volume=15|issue=2 |pages=178–186 |doi= 10.1177/10826602015002005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the [[liberalism|liberal]] [[harm principle]].

==Family==
Næss' father, Ragnar Næss, was a successful banker and Næss was the younger brother of shipowner [[Erling Dekke Næss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anonymous |title=Philosopher and Mountaineer |newspaper=The Gazette (Montreal, QC) |date=Jan 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Næss himself was a married father of two and was the uncle of mountaineer and businessman [[Arne Næss Jr.]] (1937–2004), who was once married to [[Diana Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anonymous |title=Thinker behind 'deep ecology' dies |newspaper=The Ottawa Citizen (Ottawa, ON) |date=Jan 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{unreferenced|section|date=January 2018}}
The '''Arne Næss Centre of Ecology and Philosophy'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''ANCEP'''), located in [[Norway]], is an organization focused on the philosophical heritage of Arne Næss. It was founded in 1998 as an educational organisation aimed at Norwegian students. ANCEP then worked to spread knowledge and understanding of [[ecology]], [[philosophy]] and [[non-violence]]. In 2003 ANCEP changed its name to Gateway College.

ANCEP was reestablished in June 2011 as a non-profit organization by Sjur Paulsen, Geir Grønflaten and Reidar Goffeng. With support from [[Fritt Ord (organization)|Fritt Ord]], [[Arts Council Norway]], Center for Development and Environment / [[Centre for Development and the Environment|SUM]] and the Norwegian School of Sport Science / [[Norges Idrettshøgskole]], ANCEP is now working on its first project called (Electronic Library). This project will gather all written, unpublished material by Næss to be scanned and preserved, then to be made  available for the general public as an online based digital library.

==Reception==
In their 2014 book ''Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact'', [[Blaise Cronin]] and Cassidy R. Sugimoto noted that "for impact assessment of book-based fields, bibliometricians need a database with large numbers of books" and that while the Book Citation Index did meet this need, [[Google Books]] also fulfilled this purpose and was not only free, but was (at the time) more comprehensive for bibliometric analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cronin|first1=Blaise|last2=Sugimoto|first2=Cassidy R.|title=Beyond Bibliometrics: Harnessing Multidimensional Indicators of Scholarly Impact|date=2014|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=9780262323291|pages=33, 289, 296|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxSaAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA296&amp;dq=%22Book+Citation+Index%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Ig9sVZ2QB4rLsASwyYHYBw&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Book%20Citation%20Index%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 article in the ''[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]'' remarked on the index's opportunities and limitations. It stated that the "most significant limitations to this potential application are the high share of publications without address information, the inflation of publication counts, the lack of cumulative citation counts from different hierarchical levels, and inconsistency in citation counts between the cited reference search and the book citation index."&lt;ref name=journal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gorraiz|first1=Juan|last2=Purnell|first2=Philip J.|last3=Glänze|first3=Wolfgang|title=Opportunities for and limitations of the Book Citation Index|journal=Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology|date=July 2013|volume=64|issue=7|pages=1388–1398|doi=10.1002/asi.22875|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.22875/full|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also stated that the Book Citation Index was "a first step toward creating a reliable and necessary citation data source for monographs — a very challenging issue, because, unlike journals and conference proceedings, books have specific requirements, and several problems emerge not only in the context of subject classification, but also in their role as cited publications and in citing publications."&lt;ref name=journal /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="655">'''Callaïs''' is the name of a green stone used for making beads by western European [[archaeological culture|cultures]] of the later [[Neolithic]] and Early [[Bronze Age]]. It was described by [[Pliny the Elder]] [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/37*.html#56 (NH&amp;nbsp;XXXVII.lvi.151)] as being paler than [[lapis lazuli]].

Its source was probably [[Brittany]], near Locmariaquer where numerous [[turquoise]] items have been found, although this has not been confirmed.

The '''conservation and restoration of books, manuscripts, documents and ephemera''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of items of historical and personal value made primarily from [[paper]], [[parchment]], and [[leather]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] conservation activities are generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Paper-based items, such as [[books]], scrapbooks, [[manuscripts]], maps, deeds, [[newspapers]], drawings, water colors, miniatures, and postcards present distinctive concerns when it comes to care and conservation. Unlike works of art on paper, these items are often handled directly and repeatedly to access information.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.31.&lt;/ref&gt; Even paper [[ephemera]] like newspapers and letters may be significant historical records or family mementos.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, "Preservation Measures for Newspapers", Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/newspap.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first substantial work on the subject of book restoration was [[Alfred Bonnardot]]'s ''Essai sur l'art de Restaurer les Estampes et les Livres'', first published in Paris in 1846.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Norman |first1=Jeremy |title=Alfred Bonnardot Issues the First Book on the Restoration of Rare Books and their Bindings (1846) |website=HistoryofInformation.com |url=http://www.historyofinformation.com/expanded.php?id=3433}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Petrov"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Petrov |first1=Ferdinand |title=The art of painting and the art of restoration |date=2015 |publisher=Ferdinand Petrov |location=Vancouver, British Columbia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agents of deterioration ==

=== Inherent vice ===
[[Inherent vice (library and archival science)|Inherent vice]] is "the quality of a material or an object to self-destruct or to be unusually difficult to maintain".&lt;ref&gt;National Postal Museum, "Inherent Vice," ''Smithsonian'', Accessed on 13 April 2014, [http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/stamp/5d_preserving3.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Paper, books, manuscripts, and ephemera are prime examples of materials subject to inherent vice. Early paper was handmade from plant fibers such as flax, hemp, and cotton: it is generally durable and can last for centuries.&lt;ref name="CCI418"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/418-eng.aspx |title=How to Care for Paper Documents and Newspaper Clippings |publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|date=4 January 2002 |accessdate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224951/http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/418-eng.aspx |archivedate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the mid-19th century, machine-made paper was introduced, and wood became the most common, least expensive ingredient, especially in newspapers. The presence of [[lignin]] in wood pulp paper causes acid to degrade the [[cellulose]], which causes the paper to become unstable and discolored over time.&lt;ref&gt;Dava Tobey, "Preserving History," ''Minnesota Historical Society'', Accessed on 13 April 2014, [http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/reports/nytimes_preserving.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, paper has the natural ability to absorb and retain moisture from the atmosphere, making it prone to the growth of mold, fungi, and bacteria.&lt;ref name=S30&gt;Shelley (1992), p.30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books are inherently complex; they are often made of mixed materials ranging from parchment, leather, fabric, adhesives and thread. Some inks used in old books and manuscripts are harmful to paper. [[Iron gall ink]], most commonly used from the 8th century through the end of the 19th century, contains acid and can corrode the paper in humid conditions.&lt;ref name="CCI419"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/419-eng.aspx |title=How to Care for Books |publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|date=4 January 2002|accessdate=13 April 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312224951/http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/caringfor-prendresoindes/articles/419-eng.aspx |archivedate=12 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The materials used to make books contain hundreds of [[volatile organic compounds]] (VOCs) that break down over time. They are released into the air, where they become detectable as "old-book smell". A book's smell can provide conservators with hints as to its condition. Decomposing [[cellulose]] emits [[furfural]], which has an almond-like scent. [[Lignin]] releases [[benzaldehyde]] and [[vanillin]] with a vanilla smell. [[Hexanal]] from cellulose and lignin gives off an earthy smell.  Researchers have attempted to profile the smell of old books and relate human perceptions of smell to their chemical sources. “Chocolate” and “coffee”  are the most frequently used descriptors from the Historic Paper Odour Wheel.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Wiener|first1=Ann Elizabeth  |title=What’s That Smell You’re Reading? |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/whats-that-smell-youre-reading |journal=Distillations |publisher=[[Science History Institute]]|date=2018|volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=36-39|accessdate=July 11, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Derieux"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lattuati-Derieux |first1=Agnès |last2=Bonnassies-Termes |first2=Sylvette |last3=Lavédrine |first3=Bertrand |title=Identification of volatile organic compounds emitted by a naturally aged book using solid-phase microextraction/gas chromatography/mass spectrometry |journal=Journal of Chromatography A |date=February 2004 |volume=1026 |issue=1-2 |pages=9–18 |doi=10.1016/j.chroma.2003.11.069 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ephemera]], as the name implies, was never made to survive. Flyers, postcards, and programs are often printed on poor quality paper, carelessly handled, and likely to be haphazardly displayed or stored.&lt;ref name=L33&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.33.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pests ===
Insects and vermin are naturally attracted to paper because paper is made of cellulose, starch and protein, materials that provide sources of nourishment.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt; The most common pests are roaches, silverfish, and various types of beetles.&lt;ref name=MCB&gt;Mary C. Baughman, “Approaches to Insect Problems in Paper and Books,” ''Harry Ransom Center'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/conservation/resources/insects/].&lt;/ref&gt; Book lice feed on mold spores found on paper and cardboard, and although they do not cause visible damage, their decomposition and excretions can stain paper and may also nourish other pests, continuing the cycle of damage.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; To best discourage infestation, a clean and dust-free environment is desirable: food and drink should be kept away from storage areas. If pests are discovered, they should first be identified so that appropriate measures can be taken.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt; Freezing the collection items is an option for pest mitigation: ideally (for dealing with most insects) the center of the item should be frozen within four hours at a temperature of -20&amp;nbsp;°C (about -4 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least 72 hours, following which the materials may be thawed over a 24-hour period.&lt;ref name=MCB /&gt; However, some materials should not be frozen, such as books made with leather, because the cold temperatures may cause the fat to rise to the surface of the leather resulting in a white or yellow area called a bloom.&lt;ref name=MCB /&gt; The use of insecticides directly on collection materials is not generally recommended. However, if the infestation is severe, and [[fumigation]] is the best option, the affected items should be separated from the rest of the collection for treatment.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt;

=== Environmental conditions ===
Extremes of temperature or relative [[humidity]] are damaging from either end of the spectrum (low or high).&lt;ref name=S29&gt;Shelley (1992), p.29.&lt;/ref&gt; High heat and low relative humidity can cause paper to become brittle and leather book bindings to crack.&lt;ref name=S29 /&gt; High temperatures and high relative humidity accelerates mold growth, [[foxing]], staining, blooming, disintegration, and "[[red rot]]" in leather bindings. Fluctuations in temperatures and humidity may also cause cockling: a wrinkling or puckering preventing the surface from laying flat.&lt;ref&gt;Cameo, "Cockling", ''Museum of Fine Arts Boston'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Cockling].&lt;/ref&gt; Precise environmental levels for optimal preservation will depend on whether the collection is for use, storage, or a combination: in general, a cool environment (below 70 degrees Fahrenheit) and relatively dry air (between 30-50% relative humidity) is recommended.&lt;ref&gt;Sherelyn Ogden, "Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation", ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/2.-the-environment/2.1-temperature,-relative-humidity,-light,-and-air-quality-basic-guidelines-for-preservation].&lt;/ref&gt;

Air quality must also be taken into consideration. Dust tends to absorb moisture, providing a suitable environment to attract mold growth and insects.&lt;ref name=SLV&gt;State Library of Victoria, "Caring for Works on Paper", ''State Library of Victoria'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/explore/conservation-guides/caring-works-paper].&lt;/ref&gt; Dust can also become acidic when combined with skin oils and the surface of paper.&lt;ref name=S30 /&gt;

All kinds of light (sunlight, artificial light, spotlights) can be harmful.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt; Light can result in fading, darkening, bleaching, and cellulose breakdown. Some inks and other pigments will fade if exposed to light, especially ultraviolet (UV) light present in normal daylight and from fluorescent bulbs.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; Any exposure to light can cause damage, as the effects are cumulative and cannot be reversed.&lt;ref name=S29 /&gt; Minimal or no exposure to light is ideal.

===Handling===
[[File:RDZ des Historischen Archivs der Stadt Köln - Gefriertrocknungsanlage und Archivgut-2278.jpg|right|thumb|250px|A paper conservator handling a book.]]
Other than a poor environment, poor handling is the primary cause of deterioration for books, manuscripts, and ephemera.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt; Recommendations for good handling to minimize damage include:
* A clean work area and clean hands. Food and drink should be kept away from collection materials, and smoking avoided. Hands should be washed and dried immediately before handling collection items. Hand lotions, creams and wipes should never be used prior to handling items.&lt;ref name=HRC&gt;Harry Ransom Center, “Ransom Center Guidelines: Safe Handling of Medieval and Early Modern Manuscripts,” ''The University of Texas at Austin'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://norman.hrc.utexas.edu/pubmnem/MEM_RR_Handling_8_10%20rev.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gloves should be worn only when absolutely necessary, as they may reduce dexterity and feeling.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; If worn, they should be clean white cotton gloves. 
* Loose clothing, jewelry, or buttons, may all cause damage, and should be kept under control. The user should ensure he or she is seated or standing in a stable position. Precautions should be taken if he or she is suffering from a cold.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;
* The bookmarking of pages by use of paper clips, acidic inserts, or the folding of page corners should be avoided.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP&gt;Library of Congress, "Care, Handling, and Storage of Works on Paper," ''Library of Congress'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/paper.html].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The use of rubber bands, self-adhesive tape, any kind of "leather dressing", or glue should all be avoided.&lt;ref name=LOCSOB&gt;Library of Congress, "Care, Handling, and Storage of Books," ''Library of Congress'', Accessed 13 April 2014, [https://www.loc.gov/preservation/care/books.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Adhesives can leave stains and a damaging residue.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt; 
* A book should not be forced further than its natural opening. Instead, the covers may be propped on foam wedges to decrease the opening angle, and the pages held open using book snake weights.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The turning of pages by the top corner instead of the bottom may help prevent tears.&lt;ref name=L36&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.36.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The pages of a bound manuscript should be turned slowly, and the leaves flexed as little as possible, because decorations and inks may no longer be firmly attached to parchment leaves.&lt;ref name=HRC /&gt;
* Books should be removed from the shelf by gripping on both sides of the spine at the middle (having, if necessary, pushed in the neighboring book on both sides to get a good grip).&lt;ref name=LOCSOB /&gt; Both hands should be used when removing large or heavy books from a shelf. If the volume is horizontal in a stack of books, the books above it should be removed first.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;
* Pencil, not ink, should be used to make any necessary marks or inscriptions. Inscriptions should only be made when the paper is on a clean hard surface to avoid embossing the inscription into the paper.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt;
* A work in paper should not be lifted by its edges. Instead, a thin support such as a folder or foam board should be used.&lt;ref name="MRM5"&gt;Dixie Nielson, "Object Handling," in ''MRM5: Museum Registration Methods'', eds. Rebecca Buck and Jean Allman Gilmore. (Washington, DC: AAM Press, 2010), 214–15.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parchment is not as flexible as paper, and is more resistant to unfolding. It should not be forced.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.39.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Photocopying that forces books to lie flat should be avoided. This may damage the spine and weaken pages.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;
* Items should not be piled on one another, and, for oversized items, a large clear space should be prepared. Maps and blueprints that have been rolled may be gently unfolded or unrolled if they are not brittle or weak. They can also be placed under light weight for a few weeks to relax.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage methods and materials ==
[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|thumb|250px|A paper conservator surveying a collection of materials in storage.]]
Good storage can extend the life of an item and is an important aspect of preventative conservation. Storage should be cool, dry, clean, and stable.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt; Items should be kept away from radiators or vents, which can cause environmental fluctuations.&lt;ref name=LOCWOP /&gt;

Manuscripts and paper documents should be stored in protective archival-quality boxes and folders, made of acid-free and lignin-free materials.&lt;ref name=OSE&gt;Sherelyn Ogden, “Storage Enclosures for Books and Artifacts on Paper,” ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 22 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/4.-storage-and-handling/4.4-storage-enclosures-for-books-and-artifacts-on-paper].&lt;/ref&gt; Documents that might be handled often may be stored or encapsulated in a clear [[polyester]] (Mylar) film sleeve or folder. As added protection acid formation, paper-based storage materials may have a buffer, such as calcium carbonate, which can neutralize acids as they form in the storage materials.&lt;ref name=OSE /&gt; Boxes should not be overfilled. Items may be interleaved with acid/lignin-free paper.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; If boxes are only partially full, spacers may be used, or the box may be stored horizontally.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt; Large format material is best stored in a plan cabinet with shallow drawers.&lt;ref name=SLV /&gt; The rolling of large items (e.g. maps) should be avoided where possible; but if there is no other option, the item should be rolled around a large diameter archival quality tube.&lt;ref name=L42&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The outside of the rolled item may also be covered with archival quality paper.&lt;ref name=L42 /&gt;

The best shelving for books is baked enamel steel shelving that stands away from exterior walls. Average size books should be shelved vertically, side-by-side so they can support each other.&lt;ref name=L36 /&gt; If a book is removed from the shelf, it may be replaced with a foam block to maintain verticality.&lt;ref name="MRM5"/&gt; Shelves should not be overpacked. Oversized or fragile books may be stored horizontally and completely flat, but stacking should be kept to a minimum.&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt; Books should be placed in supportive and protective boxes, to prevent soiling and abrasion as well as to provide structural support. Book boxes may range from simple four-flap enclosures made of archival safe paper or cardboard to custom clamshell or drop-spine boxes covered in book cloth.&lt;ref name=L36 /&gt;

==Active conservation and repair techniques==
*'''Surface cleaning''': Paper and leather can be dusted with a soft brush, and dust can be removed from books with a vacuum cleaner that has a cheesecloth tied over the nozzle.&lt;ref name=CYT /&gt; Nonchemical vulcanized rubber sponges or nonabrasive erasing materials such as vinyl erasers are also used. Care must be taken: an inappropriate cleaning technique could permanently ingrain dirt or remove media.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;
*'''Mold and insect removal''': Insect accretions and mold residues are normally removed by scalpels, aspirators, or specialized vacuum cleaners. Deep freezing may be appropriate to kill insects.&lt;ref name=NUA&gt;NEDCC, "Conservation Treatment for Works of Art and Unbound Artifacts on Paper," ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.5-conservation-treatment-for-works-of-art-and-unbound-artifacts-on-paper]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Adhesive removal''': Some adhesive materials are acidic and harmful to paper, causing stains. Repairs made with water-based adhesives such as animal glue can be removed in a water bath, by local application of moisture, or with poultices or steam. Synthetic adhesives and pressure-sensitive (self-adhering) tapes usually have to be dissolved or softened with an organic solvent before they can be removed. Steam is sometimes helpful to remove adhesive.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Washing and alkalization''': Washing not only removes dirt and aids in stain reduction; it can also wash out acidic compounds and other degradation products that have built up in the paper. Washing can also relax brittle or distorted paper and aid in flattening. When washing alone does not combat acidity, the addition of an alkaline buffer to paper is sometimes recommended for de-acidification. Alkalization can be achieved by immersion or by spraying.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Mending and filling''': Severe tears that cannot be stabilized with polyester film can usually be mended on the reverse with narrow strips of torn [[Japanese tissue]]. The strips are adhered with a permanent, nonstaining adhesive such as starch paste or methyl cellulose. Holes or paper losses may be filled individually with Japanese paper, with paper pulp, or with a paper carefully chosen to match the original in weight, texture, and color.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Sewing and rebinding''': Books with broken sewing, loose or detached boards or leaves require special care.&lt;ref&gt;Landrey et al. (2000), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Several techniques are used in conservation binding. The original sewing in a volume should be retained if this is possible; it can be reinforced using new linen thread and sewing supports.&lt;ref name=NBM&gt;NEDCC, "Conservation Treatment for Bound Materials of Value," ''Northeast Document Conservation Center'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/7.-conservation-procedures/7.6-conservation-treatment-for-bound-materials-of-value]&lt;/ref&gt; If the original binding is too deteriorated, the book may be rebound with new archival safe materials. An alternative to a leather-covered laced-in structure is a split-board structure, which can be covered in leather or cloth.&lt;ref name=NBM /&gt; 
*'''Backing''': Weak or brittle paper may be reinforced by backing them with another sheet of paper. Again, Japanese paper can be used as a backing, adhered with a starch paste.
*'''Flattening''': Flattening is always necessary following aqueous treatment. Flattening is also helpful for rolled or folded paper that cannot gently and safely be opened. It is usually done between blotters or felts under moderate pressure.&lt;ref name=NUA /&gt;
*'''Emergencies and disasters''': Most natural or man-made disasters, such as floods or fire, involve water. Even a small amount of water from a leaky roof or pipe can do significant damage to a paper collection. Immediate response by a knowledgeable professional or agency within the first 48 hours is crucial to the successful salvage of materials and the prevention of mold growth. Wet paper or books may be frozen to stabilize them; they can be thawed and dried at a later time.&lt;ref name=CYT /&gt;

== Reformatting options ==
Reformatting options include photocopying, [[Digitizing|digitization]], and microfilming. Many libraries and universities have book copiers where the book can be supported at an angle, avoiding the damage to its structure that can be caused by forcing it flat.&lt;ref name=L33 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CCI419 /&gt;

In spite of the [[digital revolution]], preservation microfilming is still used. Microfilm can have a life expectancy of 500 or more years, and only needs light and magnification to read.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Dalton. [http://www.nedcc.org/free-resources/preservation-leaflets/6.-reformatting/6.1-microfilm-and-microfiche "Microfilm and Microfiche"]. ''Northeast Document Conservation Center''. Accessed 22 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional conservators ==
In general, the cleaning and repair of paper documents and books should ideally be assigned to a professional conservator.&lt;ref name=CCI418 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CYT&gt;AIC, "Caring for Your Treasures," ''American Institute for Conservation of Historic &amp; Artistic Works'', Accessed 26 April 2014, [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-conservation/caring-for-your-treasures#.U13JgK1dX4g].&lt;/ref&gt; Many paper or book conservators are members of a professional body, such as the [[American Institute for Conservation]] (AIC) or the [[Guild of Bookworkers]] (both in the United States), or the [[Archives and Records Association]] (in the United Kingdom and Ireland).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7687">{{Anti-consumerism |Theories}}

'''Consumer capitalism''' is a theoretical economic and social political condition in which  [[demand|consumer demand]] is manipulated, in a deliberate and coordinated way, on a very large scale, through [[mass-marketing]] techniques, to the advantage of sellers.

This theory is controversial.  It suggests manipulation of consumer demand so potent that it has a [[coercion|coercive]] effect, amounts to a departure from [[free-market capitalism]], and has an adverse effect on society in general. According to one source, the power of such 'manipulation' is not straightforward. It depends upon a new kind of individualism - ''projective individualism'', where persons use consumer capitalism to project the kind of person who they want to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year=2012 | last1= James | first1= Paul | last2= Scerri | first2= Andy | authorlink1= Paul James (academic) | title= Globalizing Consumption and the Deferral of a Politics of Consequence | url= https://www.academia.edu/3230921/Globalizing_Consumption_and_the_Deferral_of_a_Politics_of_Consequence | journal= Globalizations | volume= 9 | issue= 2 | pages= 225–240}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some use the phrase as shorthand for the broader idea that the interests of other non-business entities (governments, religions, the military, educational institutions) are intertwined with corporate business interests, and that those entities also participate in the management of social expectations through mass media.

== Origins ==

The origins of consumer capitalism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Silla|first=Cesare|title=The Rise of Consumer Capitalism in America, 1880-1930|year=2018|publisher=Routledge|location=London-New York|url= https://books.google.it/books?id=oqVYDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT1&amp;lpg=PT1&amp;dq=the+rise+of+consumer+capitalism+in+america&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZbDa8RGHMV&amp;sig=QfS3VAuSNLwfU2eXMH2wi4pKB2U&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjf2cWsw_3aAhUrKpoKHTzvDRcQ6AEIUDAF#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20rise%20of%20consumer%20capitalism%20in%20america&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; are found in the development of American [[department store]]s from the mid 19th Century, notably the advertising and marketing innovations at [[Wanamaker's]] in [[Philadelphia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leach|first=William|title=Land of Desire|year=1993|publisher=Pantheon Books|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VHZ6UAudSiUC&amp;pg=330}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Author William Leach describes a deliberate, coordinated effort among American '[[Captain of industry|captains of industry]]' to detach consumer demand from 'needs' (which can be satisfied) to 'wants' (which may remain unsatisfied).  This cultural shift represented by the department store is also explored in [[Émile Zola]]'s 1883 novel ''[[Au Bonheur des Dames]]'', which describes the workings and the appeal of a fictionalized version of [[Le Bon Marché]].

In 1919 [[Edward Bernays]] began his career as the 'father of [[public relations]]' and successfully applied the developing principles of psychology, sociology and motivational research to manipulate public opinion in favor of products like cigarettes, soap, and [[Calvin Coolidge]].  New techniques of mechanical reproduction developed in these decades improved the channels of mass-market communication and its manipulative power.  This development was described as early as the 1920s by [[Walter Benjamin]] and related members of the [[Frankfurt School]], who foresaw the commercial, societal and political implications.

In business history, the mid-1920s saw [[Alfred P. Sloan]] stimulating increased demand for [[General Motors]] products by instituting the annual model year change and [[planned obsolescence]], a move that changed the dynamics of the largest industrial enterprise in the world, away from technological innovation and towards satisfying market expectations.

Probably the most obvious example of consumer capital tactics in the United States' history occurred during the first world war.  During which the United States' government put out several campaigns and advertisements aimed to gain support for engaging in the war. At this time the government's involvement in the economy was known as propaganda.  Advertisements, posters and campaigns were found everywhere, encouraging the public to add to the economy and consume more.  Many of these public attempts encouraged mass consumption of domestic food to help put back into the economy and support the war. and  In her book, Celia Malone Kingsbury even discusses how during the war the government manipulated the economy in such a way that the consumption of domestic food was made into a "powerful weapon."&lt;ref&gt;Kingsbury, Celia Malone. For Home and Country: World War I Propaganda on the Home Front. Lincoln: University of Nebraska, 2010. Print.
&lt;/ref&gt; The government manipulated the public by turning commercialism into a sort of nationalism, pride and support of one's country.

== Criticism ==
An important contribution to the critique of consumer capitalism has been made by the French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]], but very little of this has been translated into English. Stiegler argues that capitalism today is governed not by production but by consumption, and that the techniques used to create consumer behavior amount to the destruction of psychic and collective [[individuation]]. The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle, leading to hyperconsumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery.&lt;ref&gt;Stiegler discusses consumer capitalism in his article [http://www.arsindustrialis.org/disaffected-individual-process-psychic-and-collective-disindividuation The Disaffected Individual]. His response to the situation can be discerned by reading the [http://www.arsindustrialis.org/manifeste/index_html-en?set_language=en&amp;cl=en manifesto] of his political group, [http://www.arsindustrialis.org/ Ars Industrialis].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consumer capitalism today==

In light of the economic hardships the United States is today experiencing as a result of radical wealth inequalities, and perhaps a strong dependence on oil, consumer capitalist tactics have turned to credit as a means to maintaining a high level of expenditures in the form of consumer demand. Some of these tactics, to cite one extremely peripheral example, include government incentives to buy eco-friendly 'green' products, such as tax deductions for energy conserving home improvements or the purchasing of hybrid cars. These tactics, however, are not without critics. James Gustave Speth, former dean of the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies, and author of ''The Bridge at the Edge of the World: Capitalism, the Environment, and Crossing from Crisis to Sustainability,'' does not believe the United States government should implement such tactics. Instead Gustave believes in more direct approaches to repair or avoid environmental damage. Rather than focusing on re-boosting the distressed economy, treat the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Speth, James G.

'''Criticism of technology''' is an analysis of adverse impacts of industrial and [[Digital technology|digital]] technologies. It is argued that, in all advanced industrial societies (not necessarily only capitalist ones), technology becomes a means of domination, control, and exploitation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History and Philosophy of Science and Technology|last=Lorenzano|first=Pablo|authorlink2=Hans-Jörg Rheinberger|last2=Rheinberger|first2=Hans-Jörg|last3=Ortiz|first3=Eduardo|last4=Galles|first4=Carlos|publisher=EOLSS Publishers Co. Ltd.|year=2010|isbn=9781848267763|location=Oxford|pages=124-125}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more generally something which threatens the survival of humanity.  Some of the technology opposed by critics includes everyday household products, such as [[Refrigerator|refrigerators]], [[Home computer|computers]], and [[medication]].&lt;ref name="GlendinningChellis"&gt;[[Chellis Glendinning|Glendinning, Chellis]]. ''[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/chellis-glendinning-notes-toward-a-neo-luddite-manifesto Notes towards a Neo-Luddite manifesto]''. Utne Reader, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Prominent authors elaborating a critique of technology include [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[Langdon Winner]], [[Joseph Weizenbaum]], [[Theodore Roszak (scholar)|Theodore Roszak]], [[Günther Anders]], [[Neil Postman]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Andrew Feenberg]], [[Mike Cooley (engineer) | Mike Cooley]] and [[Lewis Mumford]]. Some authors such as [[Chellis Glendinning]] and [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] consider themselves [[Neo-Luddism|Neo-Luddites]] and hold that technological progress has had a negative impact on humanity. Their work focused on seeking meaning out of technological change, specifically wrestling with the question of "how tools and their affordances change and alter the fabric of everyday life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cjr.org/tow_center_reports/constructive_technology_criticism.php/|title=Toward a Constructive Technology Criticism|last=Watson|first=Sara|date=October 2016|work=Columbia Journalism Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellul, for instance, maintained that when people assert that technology is an instrument of freedom or the means to achieve historical destiny or the execution of divine vocation, it results in the glorification and sanctification of Technique so that it becomes that which gives meaning and value to life rather than mere ensemble of materials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jacques Ellul and the Technological Society in the 21st Century|last=Jeronimo|first=Helena|last2=Garcia|first2=Jose|last3=Mitcham|first3=Carl|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|year=2013|isbn=9789400766570|location=Dordrecht|pages=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is echoed by [[Rhetoric|rhetorical]] critics who cite the way technological discourse damages institutions and individuals who make up those institutions due to its idealization and capacity to define [[Hierarchy|social hierarchies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition: Communication from Ancient Times to the Information Age|last=Enos|first=Theresa|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=0824072006|location=New York|pages=619}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its most extreme, criticisms of technology produce analyses of technology as potentially leading to catastrophe. For instance, activist [[Naomi Klein]] described how technology is employed by capitalism in its commitment to a "shock doctrine", which promotes a series of crises so that speculative profit can be accumulated.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There are theorists who also cite the cases of the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|global financial crises]] as well as the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]] and [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima]] disasters to support their critique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Critiques also focus on specific issues such as how technology - through [[robotics]], [[automation]], and [[software]] - is destroying people's jobs faster than it is creating them, contributing to the incidence of poverty and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/515926/how-technology-is-destroying-jobs/|title=How Technology Is Destroying Jobs|last=Rotman|first=David|work=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 1970s in the US, the critique of technology became the basis of a new political perspective called [[anarcho-primitivism]], which was forwarded by thinkers such as [[Fredy Perlman]], [[John Zerzan]], and [[David Watson (anarchist)|David Watson]]. They proposed differing theories about how it became an industrial society, and not capitalism as such, that was at the root of contemporary social problems. This theory was developed in the journal Fifth Estate in the 1970s and 1980s, and was influenced by the [[Frankfurt School]], the [[Situationist International]], [[Jacques Ellul]] and others.

The critique of technology overlaps with the [[philosophy of technology]] but whereas the latter tries to establish itself as an academic discipline the critique of technology is basically a political project, not limited to [[academia]]. It features prominently in [[neomarxism|neo-Marxist]] ([[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Andrew Feenberg]]), [[ecofeminism]] ([[Vandana Shiva]]) and in [[Postdevelopment Theory|postdevelopment]] ([[Ivan Illich]])

[[File:De Re Aedificatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Title page of 1550 edition, [[Florence]]]]

'''''De re aedificatoria''''' ('''''On the Art of Building''''') is a classic architectural treatise written by [[Leon Battista Alberti]] between 1443 and 1452.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Grayson, in ''Kunstkronik'' '''213''' (1960:359ff, and ''Münchener Jahrbuch der Bildenden Kunst'' '''11''' (1960), demonstrated that the bulk of the composition was carried out between these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Although largely dependent on [[Vitruvius]]'s ''[[De architectura]]'', it was the first theoretical book on the subject written in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and in 1485 it became the first printed book on architecture.  It was followed in 1486 with the first printed edition of Vitruvius.

{{further|Mathematics and architecture|Mathematics and art}}

Alberti's ''Ten Books'' consciously echoes Vitruvius's writing, but Alberti also adopts a critical attitude toward his predecessor. In his discussion, Alberti includes a wide variety of literary sources, including [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], presenting a concise version of the [[sociology]] of [[architecture]]. ''De re aedificatoria'' is subdivided into ten books and includes:

* Book One: ''Lineaments''
* Book Two: ''Materials''
* Book Three: ''Construction''
* Book Four: ''Public Works''
* Book Five: ''Works of Individuals''
* Book Six: ''Ornament''
* Book Seven: ''Ornament to Sacred Buildings''
* Book Eight: ''Ornament to Public Secular Buildings''
* Book Nine: ''Ornament to Private Buildings''
* Book Ten: ''Restoration of Buildings''

In his survey of desirable floor plans for sacred buildings— "temples" in his phrase—Alberti begins with the ideal form of the circle, which is expressed in numerous examples of Nature. Nine ideal centrally-planned geometrical shapes are recommended for churches; besides the circle he lists the square, the hexagon, octagon, decagon and dodecagon, all derived from the circle, and, derived from the square, rectangles that exhibit the square and a half, square and a third and double square, all of which have enharmonic parallels in music. Chapels add  small geometric figures to the basic circles and polygons to give a great variety of floor plans, in which each geometrical figure retains its clear unity and simple ratios that bind all elements of the plans and elevations into a harmonic unity.

''De re aedificatoria'' remained the classic treatise on architecture from the 16th until the 18th century.

He obtained it from an Easter table attributed to Patriarch [[Cyril of Alexandria]] for the years 437–531. The latter was constructed around the year 440 by means of extrapolation from an Alexandrian Easter table constructed around the year 390 by Patriarch [[Pope Theophilus of Alexandria|Theophilus of Alexandria]]. The great historical importance of Dionysius' Easter table is twofold: 

# From this Easter table [[Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle|Bede's Easter cycle]] would ultimately be developed by means of which all future [[Julian calendar]] dates of [[Easter Sunday]] were determined (as in column G of Dionysius' table); 
# With his Easter table Dionysius introduced in passing the [[Christian era]] (see column A of Dionysius' table) which would be developed into a full system for dating historical events by [[Bede]] two centuries later.

The '''fantasy defense''' is where a defendant accused of attempting a crime (enticing [[Minor (law)|minors]] into sexual activity, for example) claims that they never intended to complete the crime. Instead, they claim they were engaged in a fantasy and, in the case of luring a minor, believed they were dealing with an adult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferraro|first=Monique Mattei|title=Investigating Child Exploitation and Pornography: The Internet, the Law and Forensic Science|year=2005|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=978-0-12-163105-5|page=283|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BtjzJhcAAGYC&amp;lpg=PA283&amp;dq=%22Fantasy%20defense%22%20-Android%20-football%20-itunes%20-wikipedia%20-game%20-football&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Casey, Eoghan|accessdate=5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== United States ==
Though grazing rights have never been codified in [[United States]] law, the concept of such rights descends from the English concept of the commons, a piece of land over which people, often neighboring landowners, could exercise one of a number of traditional rights, including livestock grazing.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, K.R. 2002. Public Lands and Political Meaning: Ranchers, the Government, and the Property Between Them. Berkeley: University of California Press, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, the traditional practice of grazing open rangeland in the United States was rarely disputed because of the sheer amount of unsettled open land. However, as the population of the western United States increased in the mid-to-late 19th century, range wars often erupted over the ranchers' perceived rights to graze their cattle as western rangelands deteriorated with overuse.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischner, T. L. 2009. Livestock grazing and wildlife conservation in the American West: historical, policy and conservation biology perspectives. Wild Rangelands: Conserving Wildlife While Maintaining Livestock in Semi-Arid Ecosystems (eds J. T. du Toit, R. Kock and J. C. Deutsch). Chidester, UK: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd, p. 235-265. pdoi: 10.1002/9781444317091.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, the [[Taylor Grazing Act]] formally set out the federal government's powers and policy on grazing federal lands in the [[western United States]] by establishing the Division of Grazing and procedures for issuing permits to graze federal lands for a fixed period of time. The Division of Grazing was renamed the US Grazing Service in 1939 and then merged in 1946 with the General Land Office to become the [[Bureau of Land Management]], which along with the [[United States Forest Service]] oversees public lands grazing in 16 western states today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/grazing.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, grazing was never established as a legal right in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Donahue D. 2005. Western grazing: the capture of grass, ground, and government. Environmental Law 35:721-806.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Taylor Grazing Act authorized only the permitted use of lands designated as available for livestock grazing while specifying that grazing permits "convey no right, title, or interest" to such lands.&lt;ref&gt;United States Code of Federal Regulations 4130.2 (c) Retrieved from http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=ecfr;sid=65dfe1cec94944c989e83b4eb39cd3ba;rgn=div5;view=text;node=43%3A2.1.1.4.92;idno=43;cc=ecfr#PartTop&lt;/ref&gt; Although the regulations stipulated by the Taylor Grazing Act apply only to grazing on Bureau of Land Management lands, the Chief of the Forest Service is authorized to permit or suspend grazing on Forest Service administered property, and many Forest Service grazing regulations resemble those of the Taylor Grazing Act.&lt;ref&gt;United States Code of Federal Regulations 36 § 222.1-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dalmatia ==
In [[Dalmatia]], [[judgment]]s about grazing rights are a fundamental part of the [[jurisprudence]]. The oldest court verdict in Dalmatia in a court case about grazing rights dates from the 14th century. It is a [[usufruct]] of [[property]], which belongs to someone else, or it is a use of a property. Use of someone else's  property requires a [[contract]] (written or not) about the usufruct. The court may declare parts of the contract as unlawful.

If there is no contract, [[common law]] (also called [[case law]]) comes to apply. The decisions on who was allowed to judge on grazing rights cases were different in the [[Middle Ages]], which reasoned in [[tradition]] and in the natural resources in each area, such as water, meadows, lawns and others. Some [[peasant]]s wrote their own [[statute]], like [[Poljica republic]] in 1440. Also, some [[duke]]s wrote together with some peasants their own statute, like [[Law codex of Vinodol]] from 1288.&lt;ref&gt;Magyar Országos Levéltár&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''history of Canadian animation''' involves a considerable element of the realities of a country neighbouring the [[United States]] and both competitiveness and co-operation cross-border.

== History ==

===1910s-1950s===
Canadians contributed greatly to the technologies and practices used to create animated television shows, movies and special effects. Starting in 1912, Canadian cartoonist and painter [[Raoul Barre]] introduced standard perforations in the drawing paper and "peg bars" to hold them in place which eliminated jerkiness when going from one image to the next. He also introduced the slash system, a method of drawing the background only once (instead of with each frame as had been done previously) on a separate sheet, leaving blank spaces for character movement. In 1913, Barre organized a systematic method of producing animated cartoons in an assembly line fashion. The assembly line method is essentially how all commercial animations (television, film etc.) are created to this day.

Prior to 1939, [[animation]] production was a very low scale with small production that were often discouraged by theatre chains like [[Famous Players]]. Such companies did not want Canadian competition to their parent companies' product. However, independent animators such as Jack (J.A). Norling in Winnipeg, Jean Arsin and Charles Lambly in Montreal, and Harold Peberdy, Bert Cob, Walter H. Swaffield and Bryant Fryer in Toronto, were able to produce short animations, primarily for advertising and educational purposes&lt;ref&gt;[https://governmentcheese.ca/~governme/writings/13-before-mclaren-canadian-animation-in-the-silent-film-era-1910-1927 Before McLaren: Canadian Animation in the Silent Film Era (1910 - 1927)]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

1939 saw the establishment of the [[National Film Board of Canada]], which provided a strong government supported organization for the creation of distinctively Canadian work.  Animation was essentially an afterthought, but an initial and short-lived period of co-production with the [[Walt Disney Company]] in the making of animated [[propaganda film]]s helped establish a core of animators who continued production after Disney withdrew.

Initially, the artistic focus of the crew was to explore types of animation apart from regular [[cel animation]] since it was decided competing with the American companies in this field was counterproductive.  With that approach, luminaries like [[Norman McLaren]] made their mark with innovative work in forms like [[drawn on film]] animation.  In addition, the agency eventually gained the confidence to produce cel animation as well.

===1960s===
Apart from the National Film Board, Canadian production in the commercial sphere was largely as limited as before.  The biggest contribution in the 1960s and much of the 1970s was in the field of [[voice acting]] with many major television productions like ''[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (TV special)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' sporting Canadian [[voice actors]] like [[Paul Soles]] and [[Paul Kligman]]. Some of the animation for these features were sub-contracted by such Canadian studios as [[Crawley Films]] in [[Ottawa]] and [[The Guest Group]] in [[Toronto]], a group of creative companies owned and run by [[Al Guest]].

The situation began to change in the late 1960s with ''[[Rocket Robin Hood]]'', which was produced by [[Al Guest]].

===1970s===
In the 1970s, independent companies were formed to produce low budget children's programming.  Some examples are ''[[The Undersea Adventures of Captain Nemo]]'', and ''[[The Toothbrush Family]]'' as well as ''[[Ukaliq]]'' and ''[[The Sunrunners]]'' all written, produced and directed by [[Al Guest]] and his partner [[Jean Mathieson]] at their Toronto company [[Rainbow Animation]].

Longer term successes began with the founding of [[Nelvana]] Animation in 1971. Nelvana took advantage of the new [[Canadian content]] broadcast rules to produce a successful series of acclaimed [[TV special]]s. They also had some success in the United States, working on productions like the animated segment of ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]'' in 1978.  However, the confidence arising from this success led to the company into an ill-advised and troubled production of a [[feature film]], ''[[Rock and Rule]]'' which proved a crippling box office failure (though it later became a cult classic).  The company turned to [[television animation]] work which proved successful [[List of Nelvana programs|with series]] like ''[[Inspector Gadget (1983 TV series)|Inspector Gadget]]'' and ''[[Care Bears]]''. The company eventually became a prime supplier of animation work into the American network TV market.

Two new players suddenly appeared in Ottawa, with [[Atkinson Film-Arts]] producing TV specials based on the [[Jean De Brunhoff]] ''[[Babar the Elephant|Babar]]'' books and the [[Lynn Johnston]] comic strip ''[[For Better or For Worse]]'', as well as the series ''[[The Adventures of Teddy Ruxpin]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (U.S.)|Dennis The Menace]]'', and animation for the film ''[[Heavy Metal (film)|Heavy Metal]]'' and the specials and subsequent series of Kevin Gillis' popular ''[[The Raccoons]]''. Disputes between Atkinson management and the ''Raccoons'' producers led Gillis' ''Raccoons'' production partner Sheldon Wiseman to form a new Ottawa studio, Hinton Animation Studios. Hinton took over animation for ''[[The Raccoons]]'', and produced animation for projects under Wiseman's own [[Lacewood Productions]]. When the studio's feature film ''[[The Nutcracker Prince]]'' performed poorly at the box office, Hinton found itself unable to pay off the money it borrowed to finance the feature; the situation was further exacerbated by creative tensions between Gillis and Wiseman. Due to these problems, Hinton dissolved in 1990, bringing an end to ''The Raccoons'' and Gillis and Wiseman's partnership. Wiseman subsequently reorganized the Hinton animation staff as Lacewood Studios, which produced a new series of ''For Better or For Worse'' specials, and co-produced several television series with producers in the United States and France.

===1980s===
In the 1980s the animation department of the French division of the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] in [[Montreal]] took centre stage by winning two [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]s for its animation shorts:  ''[[Crac]]'' in 1981 and ''[[The Man Who Planted Trees (film)|The Man Who Planted Trees]]'' in 1987. Both were produced by Frédéric Back. In about the same period private and public colleges started offering complete animation programs.  In 1984 [[Sheridan College]] of [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] won an Oscar for ''[[Charade (1984 film)|Charade]]'', by one of its graduating students, [[Jon Minnis]].

===1990s===
With the renaissance of animation in the 1990s, Canadian animation further prospered with conventional fare from companies like Nelvana and [[Cinar]] while innovative work from [[Mainframe Entertainment]] such the first [[computer animated]] series, ''[[ReBoot]]'' drew considerable success on its own. The demand for animators during this time (and also during the slow period of the 1980s) caused a global search for excellent and skilled animators causing many talented Canadians to wander the globe to fill the demand. Many Canadians can be found worldwide in prominent positions in animation companies throughout the world. From [[Richard Williams (animator)|Richard Williams]] directing animation on ''Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' in the late 1980s in England to others directing creating and supervising animation in television and commercial studios around the world including many prominent video games such as ''[[Halo 2]]'', ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic]]''.

In 1997, [[Teletoon]] (along with its French-language counterpart [[Télétoon]]) was established as Canada's first dedicated animation television channel whose broadcast license agreement stipulated [[List of programs broadcast by Teletoon|at least one original animated television series a season]].

===2000s===
Companies such as Montreal's [[Toon Boom]] and Toronto's [[Alias Systems Corporation|Alias Research]]/[[Wavefront Technologies]] and [[Side Effects Software]] have not only helped to define international technical standards, but have assumed a leadership role within the computer software industry. Toon Boom's "[[Harmony (software)|Harmony]]", Alias/Wavefront's "[[Maya (software)|Maya]]"  and Side Effects Software's "[[Houdini (software)|Houdini]]" are leading animation software packages used in many animated features and special effects. From shows as simple as ''[[Simpsons]]'' (Harmony), ''[[South Park]]'' (Maya) and ''[[Angela Anaconda]]'' (Houdini) to special effects as fantastic and complex as those seen in the [[Harry Potter films]] (both software packages) and more.

Also, animated [[Flash cartoons]] originally started as web programs began making their way to television such as ''[[Chilly Beach]]'' (2003-2006), on the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], and ''[[Odd Job Jack]]'' (2003-2007), on the [[Comedy Network]]. The former franchise was also expanded two include two [[The World Is Hot Enough|full films]]. In a similar vein, the CGI animated science fiction comedy show ''[[Tripping the Rift]]'' aired between 2004 and 2007. This also signalled the adoption of animation more [[Adult animation|aimed at adults]] pioneered in the [[United States]] by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and speciality blocks such as [[Adult Swim]]. [[Teletoon (Canada)|Teletoon]] entered this market in September 2002 with its [[Teletoon at Night]] programming block and [[Teletoon at Night#Original series|original programming]], most notably with its adult sitcom ''[[Fugget About It]]'' (2012–2016). [[G4 (Canada)|G4]] also launched its own [[Adult Digital Distraction]] on June 9, 2009, before being shut down by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] in late 2011 for violating the station's mandate; the block returned again in 2012. [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] later came to Canada itself on July 4, 2012. The [[Late night television|late-night]] [[Bionix]] block aired on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] from September 10, 2004 to February 7, 2010, airing content aimed at an older audience than usual, [[YTV (TV channel)#Anime|including]] Japanese [[anime]].

Further experimentation and exploration in the art of animation which began with the [[National Film Board of Canada]] and the works of [[Norman Mclaren]] has continued through the decades through the techniques and films of other NFB animators such as [[Jacques Drouin]], [[Christopher Hinton (animator)|Chris Hinton]], [[Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis]], [[Cordell Barker]] and many others. A few Independent organizations such as the [[Toronto Animated Image Society]] in Toronto and especially the [[Quickdraw Animation Society]] in Calgary have also formed and continue to contribute, explore the art of animation and produce new works by emerging and established Canadian animators and artists. This exploration and blending of assorted and unusual techniques can be seen in the many boutique animation companies and independent animators that have sprung up throughout Canada and has continued to propel Canada's reputation of interesting and innovative animation techniques.

The [[Ottawa International Animation Festival]] which takes place every fall in Ottawa Ontario is one of the largest and most respected animation festivals for drawing professional, commercial, independent and amateur animators and animation enthusiasts alike from all over the world.  It is sponsored by the [[Association internationale du film d'animation]], better known as [[ASIFA]] with chapters throughout the world.

===2010s===
In August 2011, NFB Animation Studio executive producer [[David Verrall]] retired, after more than 34 years at the NFB including 14 years as head of its English-language animation unit. Verrall produced or executive produced 240 NFB animated films, with ''[[Bob's Birthday]]'', ''[[Ryan (film)|Ryan]]'' and ''[[The Danish Poet]]'' winning [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film|Academy Awards]]. He was succeeded by [[Roddy McManus]].&lt;ref name=Verrall&gt;{{cite news|last=Kelly|first=Brendan|title=Sad to go, but not left reeling|url=https://montrealgazette.com/entertainment/movie-guide/left+reeling/5254797/story.html#ixzz1V6mrPKNS|accessdate=15 August 2011|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Canadian animation studio [[ToonBox Entertainment]] created the Canadian-South Korean co-production ''[[The Nut Job]]'', directed by [[Peter Lepeniotis]] and starring [[Will Arnett]]. While it garnered [[The Nut Job#Reception|mixed reviews]], it was one of the highest-budgeted and highest-grossing Canadian films of all time, with a cost of $42 million and a worldwide gross of $107 million as of September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=nutjob.htm |title=The Nut Job (2014) - Box Office Mojo |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 27, 2014 |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 13-episode animated series based on the hit live action Canadian sitcom ''[[Corner Gas]]'' (2004-2009)  was announced on December 19, 2016. The series features the voices of many of the original series' cast members, except for [[Janet Wright]] who died in 2016. It was scheduled to début in 2017 on the [[Comedy Network]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/3136435/canadian-sitcom-smash-corner-gas-to-be-rebooted-as-animated-series|title=Canadian sitcom smash ‘Corner Gas’ to be rebooted as animated series|work=CTV|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was ultimately delayed until April 2, 2018 under the official title of ''[[Corner Gas Animated]]''. Its first episode, "Dry Bones", was the highest rated première in the history of the Comedy Network.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornergas.com/corner-gas-animated-becomes-watched-series-premiere-history-comedy-network/|title=CORNER GAS ANIMATED Becomes the Most-Watched Series Premiere in the History of The Comedy Network|date=April 9, 2018|publisher=CornerGas.com|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[social construction]] of [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]]—its [[taboo]]s, [[regulation]], and [[sociology|social]] and [[politics|political]] impact—has had a profound effect on the various [[culture]]s of the world since [[prehistory|prehistoric]] times.

==The study of the history of human sexuality==
The work of Swiss jurist [[Johann Bachofen]] made a major impact on the study of the history of sexuality. Many authors, notably [[Lewis Henry Morgan]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], were influenced by Bachofen, and criticized Bachofen's ideas on the subject, which were almost entirely drawn from a close reading of ancient mythology. In his 1861 book ''Mother Right: An Investigation of the Religious and Juridical Character of Matriarchy in the Ancient World'' Bachofen writes that in the beginning human sexuality was chaotic and promiscuous. This "aphroditic" stage was replaced by a matriarchal "demeteric" stage, which resulted from the mother being the only reliable way of establishing descendants. Only upon the switch to male-enforced monogamy was paternity certainty possible, giving rise to patriarchy – the ultimate "apolloan" stage of humanity. While the views of Bachofen are not based on empirical evidence, they are important because of the impact they made on thinkers to come, especially in the field of [[cultural anthropology]].
Modern explanations of the origins of human sexuality are based in [[evolutionary biology]], and specifically the field of [[human behavioral ecology]]. Evolutionary biology shows that the human genotype, like that of all other organisms, is the result of those ancestors who reproduced with greater frequency than others. The resultant sexual behavior adaptations are thus not an "attempt" on the part of the individual to maximize reproduction in a given situation – natural selection does not "see" into the future. Instead, current behavior is probably the result of selective forces that occurred in the Pleistocene.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SxX4gRzOS6oC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;ots=Bf2t9L2LvI&amp;dq=use%20and%20misusse%20of%20darwinism%20symons&amp;pg=PA219#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Adapted Mind (Google Books Link)] "Cognitive Adaptations for Social Change" by Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, page 219.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a man trying to have sex with many women all while avoiding parental investment is not doing so because he wants to "increase his fitness", but because the psychological framework that evolved and thrived in the Pleistocene never went away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SxX4gRzOS6oC&amp;lpg=PA137&amp;ots=Bf2t9L2LvI&amp;dq=use%20and%20misusse%20of%20darwinism%20symons&amp;pg=PA137#v=twopage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Adapted Mind (Google Books Link)] On the Use and Misuse of Darwinism in the Study of Human Behavior by Donald Symons, page 137&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual speech—and by extension, writing—has been subject to varying standards of decorum since the beginning of [[history]]. For most of historic time writing has not been used by more than a small part of the total population of any society. The resulting self-censorship and euphemistic forms translate today into a dearth of explicit and accurate evidence on which to base a history. There are a number of primary sources that can be collected across a wide variety of times and cultures, including the following:
* Records of legislation indicating either encouragement or prohibition
* [[Religious]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] texts recommending, condemning or debating the topic
* Literary sources, perhaps unpublished during their authors' lifetimes, including diaries and personal correspondence
* [[Medical]] textbooks treating various forms as a pathological condition
* Linguistic developments, particularly in slang.
* More recently, studies of sexuality

[[File:Khajuraho12.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depictions of [[Apsaras]]es from the [[Khajuraho]] temple]]India played a significant role in the history of sex, from writing one of the first literature that treated [[sexual intercourse]] as a science, to in modern times being the origin of the philosophical focus of [[New Age|new-age]] groups' attitudes on sex. It may be argued that India pioneered the use of [[sexual education]] through art and literature. As in many societies, there was a difference in sexual practices in India between common people and powerful rulers, with people in power often indulging in hedonistic lifestyles that were not representative of common moral attitudes. Many of the common (and not so common) sexual practices in the world today, such as the custom and art of kissing emerged in India, proliferating with early forms of globalization.

[[File:Meister des Mahâjanaka Jâtaka 001.jpg|thumb|Fresco murals from the Ajanta caves]]

The first evidence of attitudes towards sex comes from the ancient texts of [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]], the first of which are perhaps the oldest surviving literature in the world. These most ancient texts, the [[Rig Veda|Vedas]], reveal moral perspectives on sexuality, marriage and fertility prayers. [[Sex magic]] featured in a number of Vedic rituals, most significantly in the [[Ashvamedha|Asvamedha Yajna]], where the ritual culminated with the chief queen lying with the dead horse in a simulated sexual act; clearly a fertility rite intended to safeguard and increase the kingdom's productivity and martial prowess. The epics of ancient India, the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], which may have been first composed as early as 1400 BCE, had a huge effect on the culture of [[Asia]], influencing later [[China|Chinese]], [[Japan]]ese, [[Tibet]]an and [[South East Asia]]n culture. These texts support the view that in ancient India, sex was considered a mutual duty between a married couple, where husband and wife pleasured each other equally, but where sex was considered a private affair, at least by followers of the aforementioned Indian religions. It seems that [[polygamy]] was allowed during ancient times. In practice, this seems to have only been practiced by rulers, with common people maintaining a monogamous marriage. It is common in many cultures for a ruling class to practice polygamy as a way of preserving dynastic succession

The most publicly known sexual literature of India are the texts of the [[Kama Sutra]]. These texts were written for and kept by the philosopher, warrior and nobility castes, their servants and concubines, and those in certain religious orders. These were people that could also read and write and had instruction and education. The sixty four arts of love-passion-pleasure began in India. There are many different versions of the arts which began in [[Sanskrit]] and were translated into other languages, such as Persian or Tibetan. Many of the original texts are missing and the only clue to their existence is in other texts. [[Kama Sutra]], the version by Vatsyayana, is one of the well-known survivors and was first translated into [[English language|English]] by Sir [[Richard Francis Burton|Richard Burton]] and F. F. Arbuthnot. The [[Kama Sutra]] is now perhaps the most widely read secular text in the world. It details ways in which partners should pleasure each other within a marital relationship.

When the [[Islamic]] and [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] [[English people|English]] culture arrived in India, they generally had an adverse impact on sexual liberalism in India. Within the context of the Indian religions, or dharmas, such as [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Sikhism]], sex is generally either seen as a moral duty of each partner in a long term marriage relationship to the other, or is seen as a desire which hinders spiritual detachment, and so must be renounced. In modern India, a renaissance of sexual liberalism has occurred amongst the well-educated urban population, but there is still discrimination and forced marriage incidents amongst the poor.

Within certain schools of Indian philosophy, such as [[Tantra]], the emphasis in sex as a sacred duty, or even a path to spiritual enlightenment or yogic balance is greatly emphasized. Actual sexual intercourse is not a part of every form of tantric practice, but it is the definitive feature of left-hand Tantra. Contrary to popular belief, "Tantric sex" is not always slow and sustained, and may end in orgasm. For example, the Yoni Tantra states: "there should be vigorous copulation". However, all tantra states that there were certain groups of personalities who were not fit for certain practices. Tantra was personality specific and insisted that those with pashu-bhava (animal disposition), which are people of dishonest, promiscuous, greedy or violent natures who ate meat and indulged in intoxication, would only incur bad karma by following Tantric paths without the aid of a Guru who could instruct them on the correct path. In Buddhist tantra, actual ejaculation is very much a taboo, as the main goal of the sexual practice is to use the sexual energy towards achieving full enlightenment, rather than ordinary pleasure. [[Tantric sex]] is considered to be a pleasurable experience in Tantra philosophy.

===China===
In the ''[[I Ching]]'' (The ''Book of Changes'', a Chinese classic text dealing with divination) sexual intercourse is one of two fundamental models used to explain the world. With neither embarrassment nor circumlocution, Heaven is described as having sexual intercourse with Earth. Similarly, with no sense of prurient interest, the male lovers of early Chinese men of great political power are mentioned in one of the earliest great works of philosophy and literature, the ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuang Zi]]'' (or ''Chuang Tzu'', as it is written in the old system of romanization).

China has had a long history of sexism, with even moral leaders such as Confucius giving extremely pejorative accounts of the innate characteristics of women. From early times, the [[virginity]] of women was rigidly enforced by family and community and linked to the monetary value of women as a kind of commodity (the "sale" of women involving the delivery of a [[bride price]]). Men were protected in their own sexual adventures by a transparent double standard. While the first wife of a man with any kind of social status in traditional society was almost certainly chosen for him by his [[father]] and/or [[grandfather]], the same man might later secure for himself more desirable sexual partners with the status of concubines. In addition, [[serfdom|bondservants]] in his possession could also be sexually available to him. Naturally, not all men had the financial resources to so greatly indulge themselves.

Chinese literature displays a long history of interest in affection, marital bliss, unabashed sexuality, romance, amorous dalliances, homosexual alliances—in short, all of the aspects of behavior that are affiliated with sexuality in the West. Besides the previously mentioned ''Zhuang Zi'' passages, sexuality is exhibited in other works of literature such as the [[Tang dynasty]] ''[[Yingying zhuan]]'' (''[[Biography of Cui Yingying]]''), the [[Qing dynasty]] ''[[Fu sheng liu ji]]'' (''[[Six Chapters of a Floating Life]]''), the humorous and intentionally salacious ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'', and the multi-faceted and insightful ''[[Hong lou meng]]'' (''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'', also called ''[[Story of the Stone]]''). Of the above, only the story of Yingying and her de facto husband Zhang fail to describe homosexual as well as heterosexual interactions. The novel entitled ''[[Rou bu tuan]]'' (''[[Prayer mat of flesh]]'') even describes cross-species organ transplants for the sake of enhanced sexual performance. Among Chinese literature are the [[Taoist]] classical texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigeye.com/sexeducation/ancientchina.html bigeye.com]&lt;/ref&gt; This philosophical tradition of China has developed [[Taoist Sexual Practices]] which have three main goals: health, longevity, and spiritual development.

The desire for respectability and the belief that all aspects of human behavior might be brought under government control has until recently mandated to official Chinese spokesmen that they maintain the fiction of sexual fidelity in marriage, absence of any great frequency of [[premarital sexual intercourse]], and total absence in China of the so-called "decadent capitalist phenomenon" of homosexuality. The result of the ideological demands preventing objective examination of sexual behavior in China has, until very recently, made it extremely difficult for the government to take effective action against [[sexually transmitted diseases]], especially [[AIDS]]. At the same time, large migrations to the cities coupled with China's gender imbalance and significant amounts of unemployment have led to resurgence of prostitution in unregulated venues, a prominent accelerant of the propagation of STDs to many ordinary members of society.

In recent decades the power of the family over individuals has weakened, making it increasingly possible for young men and women to find their own sexual and/or marriage partners.

{{Main|Sexuality in Japan}}
In what is often called the world's first novel, the ''[[Genji Monogatari]]'' (''[[Tale of Genji]]''), which dates back to around the eighth century AD, eroticism is treated as a central part of the aesthetic life of the nobility. The sexual interactions of Prince Genji are described in great detail, in an objective tone of voice, and in a way that indicates that sexuality was as much a valued component of cultured life as music or any of the arts. While most of his erotic interactions involve women, there is one telling episode in which Genji travels a fairly long distance to visit one of the women with whom he occasionally consorts but finds her away from home. It being late, and intercourse already being on the menu of the day, Genji takes pleasure in the availability of the lady's younger brother who, he reports, is equally satisfactory as an erotic partner.

From that time on to at least as late as the [[Meiji Reformation]], there is no indication that sexuality was treated in a pejorative way. In modern times homosexuality was driven out of sight until it reemerged in the wake of the sexual revolution with seemingly little if any need for a period of acceleration. [[Yukio Mishima]], probably the best-known Japanese writer in the outside world, frequently wrote about homosexuality, and its relationship with Japanese culture new and old. Likewise, prostitution, pornography, the tradition of the [[Geisha]], and countless types of fetish and sadomasochism have resurfaced after decades underground.

In Japan, sexuality was governed by the same social forces that make its culture considerably different from that of China, Korea, India, or Europe. In Japanese society, the primary method used to secure social control is the threat of ostracism. Japanese society is still very much a [[shame society]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}  More attention is paid to what is polite or appropriate to show others than to which behaviors might make a person seem "corrupt" or "guilty", in the Christian sense of the words. The tendency of people in Japanese society to group in terms of "in groups" and "out groups" - residue of its long history as a caste society – is a source of great pressure on every facet of society, via pop culture (reflected in the tribal, often materialistic, and very complex nature of teenage subcultures) as well as more traditional standards (as in the high-pressure role of the [[salaryman]]). Sexual expression ranges from a requirement to a complete taboo, and many, especially teenagers, find themselves playing many otherwise strictly-separate roles during the week.

A frequent locus of misconceptions in regard to Japanese sexuality is the institution of the [[geisha]]. Rather than being a prostitute, a geisha was a woman trained in arts such as music and cultured conversation, and who was available for non-sexual interactions with her male clientele. These women differed from the wives that their patrons probably had at home because, except for the geisha, women were ordinarily not expected to be prepared for anything other than the fulfillment of household duties. This limitation imposed by the normal social role of the majority of women in traditional society produced a diminution in the pursuits that those women could enjoy, but also a limitation in the ways that a man could enjoy the company of his wife. The geisha fulfilled the non-sexual social roles that ordinary women were prevented from fulfilling, and for this service they were well paid. The geisha were not deprived of opportunities to express themselves sexually and in other erotic ways. A geisha might have a patron with whom she enjoyed sexual intimacy, but this sexual role was not part of her role or responsibility as a geisha.

As a superficial level, in traditional Japanese society women were expected to be highly subservient to men and especially to their husbands. So, in a socionormal description of their roles, they were little more than housekeepers and faithful sexual partners to their husbands. Their husbands, on the other hand, might consort sexually with whomever they chose outside of the family, and a major part of male social behavior involves after-work forays to places of entertainment in the company of male cohorts from the workplace—places that might easily offer possibilities of sexual satisfaction outside the family. In the postwar period this side of Japanese society has seen some liberalization in regard to the norms imposed on women as well as an expansion of the de facto powers of women in the family and in the community that existed unacknowledged in traditional society.

In the years since people first became aware of the AIDS epidemic, Japan has not suffered the high rates of disease and death that characterize, for example, some nations in Africa, some nations in Southeast Asia, etc. In 1992, the government of Japan justified its continued refusal to allow oral contraceptives to be distributed in Japan on the fear that it would lead to reduced condom use, and thus increase transmission of AIDS.&lt;!--

====Greece====
[[File:Kiss Briseis Painter Louvre G278 full.jpg|thumb|A man kisses his younger lover on a cup ''ca.'' 480BC]]
{{See also|Homosexuality in ancient Greece|Pederasty in ancient Greece|Prostitution in ancient Greece}}

In ancient [[Greece]], the [[phallus]], often in the form of a [[herma]], was an object of worship as a symbol of fertility. This finds expression in [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[sculpture]] and other artworks. One ancient Greek male idea of female sexuality was that women envied penises of males. Wives were considered as commodity and instruments for bearing legitimate children. They had to compete sexually with [[eromenoi]], [[hetaera]]s and slaves in their own homes.

Both [[Homosexuality]] and [[Bisexuality]], in the form of ephebophilia (in some ways slavery), were social institutions in ancient Greece, and were integral to education, art, religion, and politics. Relationships between adults were not unknown but they were disfavored. [[Lesbian]] relations were also of a pederastic nature.

In ancient Greece, it was common for men to have sexual relationships with youths. These practices were a sign of maturity for youths, who looked up to men as sexual mentors.

Ancient Greek men believed that refined [[Prostitution in ancient Greece|prostitution]] was necessary for pleasure and different classes of prostitutes were available. Hetaera, educated and intelligent companions, were for intellectual as well as physical pleasure, [[Nomad|Peripatetic]] prostitutes solicited business on the streets, whereas temple or consecrated prostitutes charged a higher price. In [[Corinth]], a port city, on the [[Aegean Sea]], the temple held a thousand consecrated prostitutes.

[[Rape]] – usually in the context of warfare – was common and was seen by men as a “right of domination”. Rape in the sense of "abduction" followed by consensual lovemaking was represented even in religion: [[Zeus]] was said to have ravished many women: Leda in the form of a swan, [[Danaë]] disguised as a golden rain, [[Alkmene]] disguised as her own husband. Zeus also raped a boy, [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a myth that paralleled [[Cretan pederasty|Cretan]] custom.

====Etruria====
The ancient [[Etruscans]] had very different views on sexuality, when compared with the other European ancient peoples, most of whom had inherited the Indo-European traditions and views on the gender roles.

Greek writers, such as [[Theopompus]] and [[Plato]] named the Etruscan 'immoral' and from their descriptions we find out that the women commonly had sex with men who were not their husbands and that in their society, children were not labelled "[[illegitimacy|illegitimate]]" just because they did not know who the father was. Theopompus also described orgiastic rituals, but it is not clear whether they were a common custom or only a minor ritual dedicated to a certain deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38040291|title=Theopompus of Chios : history and rhetoric in the fourth century BC|last=A.|first=Flower, Michael|date=1997|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0198152434|location=Oxford|oclc=38040291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman citizenship|citizen]]'s duty to control his body was central to the concept of [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|male sexuality]] in the [[Roman Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; "Virtue" ''([[virtus (virtue)|virtus]]'', from ''vir'', "man") was equated with "manliness." The equivalent virtue for [[Women in Ancient Rome|female citizens]] of good social standing was ''[[pudicitia]]'', a form of sexual integrity that displayed their attractiveness and self-control.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rebecca Langlands]], ''Sexual Morality in Ancient Rome'' (Cambridge University Press, 2006), pp. 37–38 ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Female sexuality|Female sexuality]] was encouraged [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Marital sex|within marriage]]. In [[paterfamilias|Roman patriarchal society]], a "real man" was supposed to govern both himself and others well, and should not submit to the use or pleasure of others.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992, 2002, originally published 1988 in Italian), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Homosexuality in ancient Rome|Same-sex behaviors]] were not perceived as diminishing a Roman's masculinity, as long as he played the penetrative or dominating role. Acceptable male partners were social inferiors such as [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|prostitutes, entertainers]], and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|slaves]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|Sex with freeborn male minors]] was formally prohibited (see ''[[Lex Scantinia]]''). "Homosexual" and "heterosexual" thus did not form the primary dichotomy of Roman thinking about sexuality, and no [[Latin]] words for these concepts exist.&lt;ref&gt;Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality'' (Oxford University Press, 1999, 2010), p. 304, citing Saara Lilja, ''Homosexuality in Republican and Augustan Rome'' (Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1983), p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Depictions of frank sexuality are abundant in [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Erotic literature and art|Roman literature and art]]. The ''[[fascinum]]'', a [[phallic]] charm, was a [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Phallic sexuality|ubiquitous decoration]]. [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex acts and positions|Sexual positions and scenarios]] are depicted in great variety among the [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|wall paintings preserved at Pompeii and Herculaneum]]. Collections of poetry celebrated love affairs, and ''[[Ars Amatoria|The Art of Love]]'' by the [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustan poet]] [[Ovid]] playfully instructed both men and women in how to attract and enjoy lovers. Elaborate theories of human sexuality based on [[ancient Greek philosophy|Greek philosophy]] were developed by thinkers such as [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Epicurean sexuality|Lucretius]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Stoic sexual morality|Seneca]]. [[Classical mythology|Classical myths]] often deal with sexual themes such as [[gender identity]], [[adultery]], [[incest]], and [[rape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/212125918|title=Sexuality and gender in the classical world : readings and sources|date=2002|publisher=Blackwell Publishers|others=McClure, Laura, 1959-, Wiley InterScience (Online service)|isbn=0470755539|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=212125918}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other aspects of Roman life, sexuality was supported and regulated by [[Religion in ancient Rome|traditional Roman religion]], both the [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sex, religion and the state|public cult of the state]] and [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Healing and magic|private religious practices and magic]].&lt;ref&gt;As argued by Ariadne Staples throughout ''From Good Goddess to Vestal Virgins: Sex and Category in Roman Religion'' (Routledge, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cicero]] held that the desire to procreate ''([[libido]])'' was "the seedbed of the republic," as it was the cause for the first form of social institution, [[Marriage in ancient Rome|marriage]], which in turn created the family, regarded by the Romans as the building block of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''[[De officiis]]'' 1.17.54; Sabine MacCormack, "Sin, Citizenship, and the Salvation of Souls: The Impact of Christian Priorities on Late-Roman and Post-Roman Society," ''Comparative Studies in Society and History'' 39.4 (1997), p. 651.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roman law]] penalized sex crimes ''([[stuprum]])'', particularly [[History of rape#Ancient Rome|rape]], as well as [[Marriage in ancient Rome#Adultery|adultery]]. A Roman husband, however, committed the crime of adultery only when his sexual partner was a married woman.

[[Prostitution in ancient Rome|Prostitution]] was legal, public, and widespread. Entertainers of any gender were assumed to be sexually available (see ''[[infamia]]''), and [[gladiator]]s were sexually [[Glamour (presentation)|glamorous]]. [[Slavery in ancient Rome|Slaves]] lacked [[legal person]]hood, and were vulnerable to [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Master-slave relations|sexual exploitation]].

The dissolution of Republican ideals of physical integrity in relation to political liberty contributes to and is reflected by the sexual license and decadence associated with the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;This is a theme throughout Carlin A. Barton, ''The Sorrows of the Ancient Romans: The Gladiator and the Monster'' (Princeton University Press, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt; Anxieties about the loss of liberty and the subordination of the citizen to the emperor were expressed by a perceived increase in passive homosexual behavior among free men.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Richlin, "Sexuality in the Roman Empire," in ''A Companion to the Roman Empire'', p. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexual conquest and imperialism|Sexual conquest]] was a frequent metaphor for Roman imperialism.:&lt;ref&gt;Davina C.

Children slept in the same room as their parents and were able to witness their parents while they had sex. Intercourse simulation became real penetration as soon as boys were physically able. Adults found simulation of sex by children to be funny. As children approached 11 attitudes shifted toward girls.

Premarital sex was not encouraged but was allowed in general, restrictions on adolescent sexuality were incest, exogamy regulations, and  firstborn daughters of high-ranking lineage. After their firstborn child, high-ranking women were permitted extramarital affairs.

The second sexual revolution was a substantial change in [[sexual morality]] and [[human sexual behaviour|sexual behaviour]] throughout the West in the 1960s and early 1970s. One factor in the change of values pertaining to sexual activities was the invention of new, efficient technologies for the personal control of ability to enter pregnancy. Prime among them, at that time, was the [[combined oral contraceptive pill|first birth control pill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gender.stanford.edu/news/2011/pill-and-marriage-revolution|title=The pill and the marriage revolution {{!}} The Clayman Institute for Gender Research|website=gender.stanford.edu|access-date=2018-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liberalized laws on abortion in many countries likewise made it possible to safely and legally break off an unwanted pregnancy without having to invoke a birth posing grave danger to the health of the mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903358,00.html?promoid=googlep%7ctitle=Abortion_and_Privacy%7caccessdate=2013-12-13|work=Time|date=13 March 1972|title=The Law: Abortion and Privacy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of homosexuality}}
Societal attitudes towards same-sex relationships have varied over time and place, from expecting all males to engage in same-sex relationships, to casual integration, through acceptance, to seeing the practice as a minor sin, repressing it through law enforcement and judicial mechanisms, and to proscribing it under penalty of death.

In a detailed compilation of historical and [[ethnography|ethnographic]] materials of [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial cultures]], "strong disapproval of homosexuality was reported for 41% of 42 cultures; it was accepted or ignored by 21%, and 12% reported no such concept. Of 70 ethnographies, 59% reported homosexuality absent or rare in frequency and 41% reported it present or not uncommon." &lt;ref&gt;Adolescence and puberty By John Bancroft, June Machover Reinisch, p.162&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultures influenced by [[Abrahamic religions]], the [[Sodomy law#History|law]] and the [[Christianity and homosexuality#History of Christianity and homosexuality|church]] established [[sodomy]] as a transgression against divine law or a [[crime against nature]]. The condemnation of [[anal sex]] between males, however, predates Christian belief. It was frequent in ancient Greece; "unnatural" can be traced back to [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;"... sow illegitimate and bastard seed in [[courtesan]]s, or sterile seed in males in defiance of nature." — [[Plato]], in ''[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]'' (Book VIII p.841 edition of Stephanus or p.340, edition of Penguin Books, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt;

Many historical figures, including [[Socrates]], [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Lord Byron]], [[Edward II of England|Edward II]], and [[Hadrian]],&lt;ref&gt;''Roman Homosexuality'', Craig Arthur Williams, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; have had terms such as ''gay'' or ''[[bisexuality|bisexual]]'' applied to them; some scholars, such as [[Michel Foucault]], have regarded this as risking the anachronistic introduction of a contemporary [[social constructionism|construction]] of sexuality foreign to their times,&lt;ref name="foucault"&gt;{{harv|Foucault|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; though others challenge this.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Hubbard, Review of David M. Halperin, ''How to Do the History of Homosexuality.'' in ''[[Bryn Mawr Classical Review]]'' 2003.09.22&lt;/ref&gt;

A common thread of constructionist argument is that no one in antiquity or the Middle Ages experienced homosexuality as an exclusive, permanent, or defining mode of sexuality. John Boswell has countered this argument by citing ancient Greek writings by Plato,&lt;ref name=boswell1&gt;{{harv|Boswell|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; which describe individuals exhibiting exclusive homosexuality.

==Religion and sex==
{{Main|Religion and sexuality}}

===Judaism===
In Jewish law, sex is not considered intrinsically sinful or shameful when conducted in marriage, nor is it a necessary evil for the purpose of procreation. Sex is considered a private and holy act between a husband and wife. Certain deviant sexual practices, enumerated below, were considered gravely immoral "abominations" sometimes punishable by death. The residue of sex was considered ritually unclean outside the body, and required [[Ritual washing in Judaism|ablution]].&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baarda|first1=Benjamin I.|last2=Sikora|first2=Aleksandra E.|title=Proteomics of Neisseria gonorrhoeae: the treasure hunt for countermeasures against an old disease|journal=Frontiers in Microbiology|volume=6|year=2015|issn=1664-302X|doi=10.3389/fmicb.2015.01190|postscript=; Access provided by the [[University of Pittsburgh]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, some scholars have questioned whether the Old Testament banned all forms of homosexuality, raising issues of translation and references to ancient cultural practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shrine Prostitutes – Is THAT what Moses was talking about in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13?|url=http://www.gaychristian101.com/Shrine-Prostitutes.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, rabbinic Judaism had unambiguously condemned homosexuality.

====Mosaic law====
*''And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and rule over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the sky and over all the beasts that tread upon the earth.'' (Genesis 1:28)

The [[Torah]], while being quite frank in its description of various sexual acts, forbids certain relationships. Namely, [[adultery]], all forms of [[incest]], male [[homosexuality]], [[bestiality]], and introduced the idea that one should not have sex during the wife's [[Menstrual cycle|period]]:
*''You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife, to become defiled by her.'' (Lev. 18:20)
*''Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is abomination.'' (Lev. 18:22)
*''And with no animal shall you cohabit, to become defiled by it. And a woman shall not stand in front of an animal to cohabit with it; this is depravity.'' (Lev. 18:23)
*''And to a woman during the uncleanness of her separation, you shall not come near to uncover her nakedness.'' (Lev. 18:19)

The above passages may, however, be open to modern interpretation. The original meanings of these verses did not change, but their interpretation may have changed after they were translated into English and other languages. This view however, has been counteracted by conservatives.

===Christianity===
Christianity re-emphasised the Jewish attitudes on sexuality with two new concepts. First, there was the re-iterated idea that marriage was absolutely exclusive and indissoluble, placing further guidance on divorce and expanding on the reasons and principles behind those laws. Second, in Old Testament times marriage was almost universal, in continuity with the total matrimony in Eden, but in the New Testament, the trajectory is extended forward to the goal of no marriage in the new heavens and new earth (see Matthew 22). Practically therefore the new age after Jesus now has marriage as only normative, but celibacy is a valuable gift in and of itself.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

====New Testament====
The [[New Testament]] is quite clear on principles regarding sexual relations. In one of his letters to the Corinthian church, Paul directly answers some questions they had asked about this.

{{quote|1 Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: 'It is well for a man not to touch a woman.' 2 But because of cases of sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband. 3 The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband. 4 For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does. 5 Do not deprive one another except perhaps by agreement for a set time, to devote yourselves to prayer, and then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control. 6 This I say by way of concession, not of command. 7 I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has a particular gift from God, one having one kind and another a different kind." (1 Corinthians 7:1-9, NRSV)}}

Paul is speaking into a situation where the church was falling into lust, and some members even using prostitutes (6:16), while others advocated a 'higher spirituality' that wrongly denied pleasure from earthly things, including abstinence from sex (7:1). Paul writes to them to explain the right context for sex in marriage, and the importance of couples keeping having sex and giving each other pleasure, but encourages them to pursue celibacy (as he later explains [7:32-35], so that they may devote more time and energy to others) wherever God has granted that gift (7:7).

Many other passages refer to sex or marriage.

====Later Christian thought====
St. [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]] opined that before Adam's fall, there was no lust in the sexual act, but that it was entirely subordinate to human reason. Later theologians similarly concluded that the lust involved in sexuality was a result of [[original sin]], but nearly all agreed that this was only a venial sin if conducted within marriage without inordinate lust.

In Reformed schools, as represented for example by the [[Westminster Confession]], three purposes of marriage are drawn out: for mutual encouragement, support, and pleasure; for having children; and to prevent lustful sin.

Today, many Christians have adopted the view that there is no sin whatsoever in the uninhibited enjoyment of marital relations. Some Christians will tend to limit the circumstances and degree to which sexual pleasure is morally licit, for example to build self-control to prevent sex becoming addictive, or as a fast.

===Hinduism===
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}

In India, [[Hinduism]] accepted an open attitude towards sex as an art, science and spiritual practice. The most famous pieces of Indian literature on sex are [[Kamasutra]] (Aphorisms on Love) and [[Kamashastra]] (from Kama = pleasure, shastra = specialised knowledge or technique). This collection of explicit sexual writings, both spiritual and practical, covers most aspects of human courtship and sexual intercourse. It was put together in this form by the sage [[Vatsyayana]] from a 150 chapter manuscript that had itself been distilled from 300 chapters that had in turn come from a compilation of some 100,000 chapters of text. The Kamasutra is thought to have been written in its final form sometime between the third and fifth century AD.

Also notable are the sculptures carved on temples in India, particularly the [[Khajuraho]] temple. The frank depiction of uninhibited sex hints towards a liberated society and times where people believed in dealing openly with all aspects of life. On the other hand, a group of thinkers believe that depiction of sexually implicit carvings outside the temples indicate that one should enter the temples leaving desires (kama).

Apart from Vatsyayana's Kamashastra, which is no doubt the most famous of all such writings, there exist a number of other books, for example:
*The ''[[Ratirahasya]]'', literal translation – secrets (rahasya) of love (rati, the union);
*The ''[[Panchasakya]]'', or the five (panch) arrows (sakya);
*The ''[[Ratimanjari]]'', or the garland (manjari) of love (rati, the union)
*The ''[[Anunga Runga]]'', or the stage of love.

The ''Secrets of Love'' was written by a poet named Kukkoka. He is believed to have written this treatise on his work to please one Venudutta, considered to be a king. This work was translated into Hindi years ago and the author's name became Koka in short and the book he wrote was called ''[[Ratirahasya|Koka Shastra]]''. The same name crept into all the translations into other languages in India. ''Koka Shastra'' literally means doctrines of Koka, which is identical with the ''Kama Shastra'', or doctrines of love, and the names ''Koka Shastra'' and ''Kama Shastra'' are used indiscriminately.

===Islam===
In [[Islam]] sexual intercourse is allowed only after [[marriage]] and only with one's spouse. Sex outside of marriage is prohibited, called [[zina]], as is adultery, which is considered a sin and is strictly prohibited and  punishable. According to the chapter Al-Israa', verse 32 of the [[Qur'an]], [[Allah]] (God) prohibits Muslims from getting close to (engaging in) zina, and having relations with anyone other than one's spouse. And since marriage is only between a man and a woman, any sexual intercourse between two men is prohibited. Islam does not accept homosexuality or allow anal sex even between married couples or even during menstrual cycles. Furthermore, sex is like an act of charity if done with right intentions. One cannot seek sexual means outside of marriage and must lower gaze when outside.

==Technology and sex==
In the mid 20th century advances in medical science and modern understanding of the [[menstrual cycle]] led to observational, surgical, chemical and laboratory techniques to allow diagnosis and the treatment of many forms of infertility.

==Pederasty==
{{Seealso|Pederasty|Shudo|Pederasty in ancient Greece|Shunga|Shotacon}}

Many cultures normalized or promoted adult males and male youths, usually teenagers, entering into pedagogic friendships or love affairs that also had an erotic dimension. These were usually sexually expressed, but chaste ones were not infrequent. If sexual, that phase of the relationship lasted until the youth was ready for adulthood and marriage. Other cultures saw such relationships as inimical to their interests – often on religious grounds – and tried to stamp them out.

==Zoophilia==
{{Main|History of zoophilia}}
[[Zoophilia]] or bestiality—sexual activity between humans and animals—probably dates back to prehistory. Depictions of humans and animals in a sexual context appear infrequently in [[rock art]] in Europe beginning around the onset of the [[Neolithic]] and the domestication of animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bahn|first=Paul G.|title=The Cambridge illustrated history of prehistoric art|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-45473-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwm_D1u_UTsC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq|accessdate=18 February 2012|page=188}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bestiality remained a common theme in mythology and folklore through the classical period and into the Middle Ages (e.g. ''[[Leda and the Swan]]'')&lt;ref name="HSEB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Cornog|first1=M.|last2=Perper|first2=T.|year=1994|title=Bestiality|editor1-last=Haeberle|editor1-first=E. J.|editor2-last=Bullough|editor2-first=B. L.|editor3-last=Bullough|display-editors=3|editor4-last=B.|encyclopedia=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia|publisher=Garland|location=New York &amp; London|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH06.HTM#b3-BESTIALITY|accessdate=18 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204033652/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/GESUND/ARCHIV/SEN/CH06.HTM#b3-BESTIALITY|archivedate=4 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several ancient authors purported to document it as a regular, accepted practice – albeit usually in "other" cultures.

Explicit legal prohibition of human sexual contact with animals is a legacy of the [[Abrahamic religions]]:&lt;ref name="HSEB" /&gt; the [[Hebrew Bible]] imposes the death penalty on both the person and animal involved in an act of bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:15|131}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are several examples known from medieval Europe of people and animals executed for committing bestiality. With the [[Age of Enlightenment]], bestiality was subsumed with other sexual "crimes against nature" into civil [[sodomy]] laws, usually remaining a capital crime.

Bestiality remains [[Zoophilia and the law|illegal in most countries]]. Though religious and "crime against nature" arguments may still be used to justify this, today the central issue is the ability of non-human animals to give [[consent]]: it is argued that sex with animals is inherently [[Sexual abuse|abusive]].&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom. ''Animal Rights, Human Wrongs''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2003, pp. 63-4, 89.&lt;/ref&gt; In common with many [[paraphilia]]s, the [[internet]] has allowed the formation of a zoophile community that has begun to lobby for zoophilia to be considered an alternative sexuality and for the legalisation of bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Francis|first=Thomas|title=Those Who Practice Bestiality Say They're Part of the Next Sexual Rights Movement|url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/2009-08-20/news/those-who-practice-bestiality-say-they-re-part-of-the-next-gay-rights-movement/|accessdate=18 February 2012|newspaper=Broward Palm Beach New Times|date=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prostitution==
{{Main|History of prostitution}}

[[Prostitution]] is the sale of sexual services, such as oral sex or sexual intercourse. Prostitution has been described as the "world's oldest profession". Gonorrhoeae is recorded at least up to 700 years ago and associated with a district in Paris formerly known as "Le Clapiers". This is where the prostitutes were to be found at that time.&lt;ref name="BaardaSikora2015" /&gt;

In some cultures, prostitution has been an element of religious practices. [[Religious prostitution]] is well documented in the ancient cultures of the near East, such as [[Sumer]], [[Babylon]], [[ancient Greece]] and [[Israel]], where prostitutes appear in the [[Bible]]. In [[Greece]] the [[hetaerae]] were often women of high social class, whereas in [[Rome]] the [[meretrices]] were of lower social order. The [[Devadasi]], prostitutes of [[Hindu]] temples in south [[India]], were made illegal by the Indian government in 1988.

==Sexually transmitted diseases==
{{Main|Sexually transmitted diseases|Safe sex}}
For much of human history, sexually transmitted diseases have been a scourge of humanity. They raged unchecked through society until the discovery of [[antibiotics]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The development of inexpensive condoms and education about sexually transmitted diseases has helped reduce risks. For a period of about thirty years (in the second half of the twentieth century) their threat subsided.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, due to the free movement of people and uncontrolled distribution of antibiotics, organisms resistant to antibiotics quickly spread and at the present time pose a threat to people who have more than one sex partner.

===AIDS===
{{Main|AIDS}}
AIDS has profoundly changed modern sexuality. It was first noticed (although many historians feel that the first case was in 1959) spreading among [[Homosexuality|gay]] men and [[recreational drug use|intravenous drug users]] in the 1970s and 1980s. Today, the majority of victims are [[heterosexual]] women, men, and children in [[developing countries]]. In most developing countries, fear of epidemic has drastically changed many aspects of twentieth century human sexuality. Fear of contracting AIDS has driven a revolution in [[sex education]], which now centers far more the use of protection and [[abstinence]], and spends much more time discussing sexually transmitted diseases.

Further effects of this disease run deep, radically impacting the expected average lifespan as reported by the BBC News: "[The expected average lifespan] is falling in many African countries – a girl born today in [[Sierra Leone]] could expect only to live to 36, in contrast to [[Japan]], where today's newborn girl might reach 85 on average."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/3330155.stm BBC News]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6474">'''IGNITOR''' is the Italian name for a nuclear research project of [[magnetic confinement fusion]], developed by [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] Laboratories in [[Frascati]]. Construction (in Russia) is not complete.

The project theory is based on ignited plasma in [[tokamak]]. Started in 1977 by Prof. [[Bruno Coppi]] of [[MIT]], IGNITOR is based on the 1970s [[Alcator]] machine at MIT which pioneered the high magnetic field approach to plasma magnetic confinement, continued with the [[Alcator C-Mod|Alcator C/C-Mod]] at MIT and the [[FT/FTU]] series of experiments.  

Compared to the [[ITER]] international project, IGNITOR would be much smaller and cheaper: the ITER reactor is 19,000 tons{{vague|which tons?|date=January 2010}} in weight while the IGNITOR is only 500 tons in weight. IGNITOR is designed to produce approximately 100 [[Megawatt|MW]] of fusion power (and ITER to produce ~500 MW fusion power).

==Development==
At a meeting with the scientific attachés of the European embassies in Moscow in early February 2010 [[Mikhail Kovalchuk]], Director of the [[Kurchatov Institute]],  announced that an initiative aimed at developing a fast paced joint research programme in nuclear fusion research was strongly supported by the Governments of Russia and Italy.

The original proposal had been initiated earlier by [[Evgeny Velikhov]] (President of the Kurchatov Institute) and Bruno Coppi (Head of the High Energy Plasmas Undertaking, MIT) during the early developments of the [[Alcator C-Mod]] programme at MIT, where well known scientists of the Kurchatov Institute made key contributions to experiments that identified the unique confinement and purity properties of the high density plasmas produced by the high field Alcator machine. In effects this investigated, for the first time, physical processes leading to attain self-sustained fusion burning plasmas.

The collaboration with the Kurchatov Institute is directed at the construction of the Ignitor machine, the first experiment proposed to achieve ignition conditions by nuclear fusion reactions on the basis of existing knowledge of plasma physics and available technologies. Ignitor is part of the line of research on high magnetic field, experiments producing high density plasmas that began with the Alcator and the Frascati Torus programs at MIT and in Italy, respectively. It remains, at the world level, the only experiment capable of reaching ignition by the magnetic field confinement approach. However, several fusion scientists have contested the claim made for IGNITOR that it is a bigger step towards fusion power than the international [[ITER]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | doi = 10.1038/news.2010.214
| title = Fusion reactor aims to rival ITER
| journal = Nature
| date = 2010
| last1 = Feresin | first1 = Emiliano 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to existing plans, Ignitor will be installed at the Triniti site at [[Troitsk, Moscow Oblast|Troitsk]] near Moscow that has facilities which can be upgraded to house and operate the machine. This site will become open and made to be easily accessible to scientists of all nations. The management of the relevant research programme will involve Italy and Russia only to facilitate the success of the enterprise. The proponents have suggested that the [[United States|US]] become an Associate Member of this effort with a similar arrangement to that made with [[CERN]] for its participation in the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] (Large Hadron Collider) Programme.

The goal to produce meaningful fusion reactors in a reasonable time leads to pursuing the achievement of ignition conditions in the near term in order to understand the plasma physical regimes needed for a net power producing reactor. In addition, an objective other than ignition that can be envisioned for the relatively near term is that of high flux neutron sources for material testing involving compact, high density fusion machines. This has been one of the incentives that have led the Ignitor Project to adopt [[magnesium diboride]] (MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) superconducting cables in the machine design, a first in fusion research. Accordingly, the largest coils (about 5 m diameter) of the machine will be made entirely of MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cables.

In the context of the Italy-Russia summit meeting held in Milan on 26 April 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legnostorto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28544&amp;Itemid=46&lt;/ref&gt; the agreement to proceed with the proposed joint Ignitor program has been signed. The participants, from the Russian side, have included the Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]], the Deputy Prime Minister [[Igor Sechin]], the Energy Minister [[Sergei Shmatko]], and the Vice Minister of Education and Research Sergey Mazurenko. Participants from the Italian side have included Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Prime Minister Valentino Valentini (who had a key role in forging the agreement on the Ignitor program), and the Minister of Education and Research [[Mariastella Gelmini]] who, together with Sergey Mazurenko, signed the agreement in the presence of the two Prime Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banchedati.camera.it/sindacatoispettivo_16/showXhtml.Asp?idAtto=1684&amp;stile=6&amp;highLight=1 Dati Camera dei Deputati]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corriere.it/esteri/10_aprile_26/putin-berlusconi-incontro-nucleare_d26240c2-5113-11df-884e-00144f02aabe.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
IEP is dedicated to shifting the world's focus to peace as a positive, achievable, and tangible measure of human well-being and progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jubitz.org/peace|title=Peacebuilding|website=jubitz.org|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It achieves its goals by developing global and national peace indices, calculating the ''economic cost of violence'', analysing country level risk and understanding the conditions which underpin highly peaceful societies - ''Positive Peace''.

IEP produce frameworks to define peacefulness, providing metrics for measurement, uncovering the relationship between peace, business, and prosperity, and by promoting a better understanding of the cultural, economic, and political factors that drive peacefulness.

It also collaborates with intergovernmental organizations such as the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[Commonwealth Secretariat]], [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/librarypage/crisis-prevention-and-recovery/development-of-goal-and-purpose-indicators-for-undp.html|title=Development of Goal and Purpose Indicators for UNDP|website=undo.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UNICEF]], [[NATO]], the [[World Bank Group]], and [[UN Peacebuilding Support Office]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/peacebuilding/pbso&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2015, IEP has been an active member of the [[United Nations Global Compact|UN Global Compact]] Expert Group&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unglobalcompact.org/what-is-gc/participants/66591-Institute-for-Economics-and-Peace-|title=Institute for Economics and Peace  {{!}} UN Global Compact|website=www.unglobalcompact.org|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Responsible Business and Investment in High-Risk Areas.

IEP has a strategic partnership with [[Rotary International]] and [[One Young World]], which involves training of Global Peace Index Ambassadors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://my.rotary.org/en/news-media/rotary-peace-fellows-win-competition-spread-peace|title=Rotary Peace Fellows win competition to spread peace {{!}} My Rotary|website=my.rotary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; the program focuses on engaging young leaders in understanding IEP’s empirical peace research.

IEP is also a member of the [[Sustainable Development Goals|Sustainable Development Goal]] 16 Data Initiative, which is a consortium that compiles existing global data to assist in tracking progress towards achieving Goal 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prio.org/Events/Event/?x=8438|title=Measuring Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies: Launch of the SDG16 Data Initiative|last=(PRIO)|first=Peace Pesearch Institute Oslo|website=www.prio.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Peace Index ==
The core asset of the IEP is the [[Global Peace Index]] (GPI), which is now considered the benchmark study in measuring peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-40118188|title=Global Peace Index 2017: World 0.28% more peaceful than last year|last=|first=|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/events/measuring-and-understanding-peace|title=Measuring and Understanding Peace|last=|first=|date=|website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI has been recognized by leading analysts and institutions, and has been incorporated into reports such as the [[Stockholm International Peace Research Institute]]'s Year Book (2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2016),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Appendix 2B.

The data for the GPI is collected and collated in collaboration with the [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] (EIU),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Detailed information can be found from | url= http://www.eiu.com/site_info.asp?info_name=corporate_landing_united_nations&amp;rf=0| accessdate =2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the research and analysis arm of the [[Economist Group]], and the methodology is informed and reviewed each year by an international panel of peace and statistics experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Peaceful Nations|publisher= Alliance for Peacebuilding |url= http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/documents/GSPNPeacefulNationsReportFinal_001.pdf| accessdate =2010-04-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPI is released annually with presentations typically held in [[London]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Geneva]], [[Paris]], [[New York City]], [[Sydney]], [[Brussels]] and [[The Hague]].

The GPI is used by various international organizations, such as the [[United Nations|UN]] and [[World bank|World Bank]] as a source of data and information as well as being used by academics and universities around the world.

In addition, the GPI was the empirical basis for the Symposium of Peaceful Nations, a 3-day conference hosted in November 2009 to honor the most peaceful countries in each of nine regions of the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/documents/GSPNPeacefulNationsReportFinal_001.pdf|title=Symposium of Peaceful Nations|accessdate=2010-04-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which [[Helen Clark]], UNDP Administrator, delivered the keynote address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2009/november/helen-clark-statement-at-the-global-symposium-of-peaceful-nations.en|title=Helen Clark: Statement at the Global Symposium of Peaceful Nations|accessdate=2010-04-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100228165855/http://content.undp.org/go/newsroom/2009/november/helen-clark-statement-at-the-global-symposium-of-peaceful-nations.en|archivedate=2010-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for Economics &amp; Peace, in 2016, marked 10 years of measuring and analysing global levels of peace. In celebration of this milestone, IEP along with the Diplomatic Courier Magazine hosted the Future of Peace Summit in Washington D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.allianceforpeacebuilding.org/event/2016/06/future-of-peace-summit/|title=Future of Peace Summit|work=Alliance for Peacebuilding|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th annual GPI launched in June 2017 includes 163 countries in the world, and the interactive map on [http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/global-peace-index/ the website] explains the rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/global-peace-index-us-middle-east-relations-donald-trump-syria-politics-iran-a7766561.html|title=Last year there were 10 countries in the world entirely free from war.

The 2017 GPI recorded a small improvement in average global peace, with 93 countries recording higher levels of peace and 68 recording a deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australian_outlook/global-peace-17/|title=The Status of World Peace May Surprise You|work=Australian Institute of International Affairs|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Peace Indices==
IEP has also launched a series of National Peace Indices. The first one was the United States Peace Index ([[United States Peace Index|USPI]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/us-peace-index/|title=US Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2011. The USPI ranks each state in the US by peacefulness and, unlike the [[Global Peace Index|GPI]], uses only 5 indicators: incarceration rate, the number of police officers, the number of homicides, the availability of small arms, and the number of violent crimes. In 2011 Maine was ranked the most peaceful state, while Louisiana was the least peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visionofhumanity.org/#/page/our-uspi-findings&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/03/UK-Peace-Index-report-2013.pdf UK Peace Index] was conducted in 2013. The UK Peace Index provides a comprehensive measure of the levels of peacefulness within the United Kingdom from 2003 to 2012.

The [[Mexico Peace Index]] ([[Mexico Peace Index|MPI]]) is the latest in the series of National Peace Indices. There have been 4 editions of the MPI to date, the first published in 2013, and most recently 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/mexico-peace-index/|title=Mexico Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MPI uses five indicators to gauge the level of peace in the 32 Mexican states from 2003-2016. The indicators are: ''Homicide rates, violent crime, detention without a sentence, weapons crime'' and ''organised crime''.

An expert panel is engaged to provide independent advice and technical guidance in developing the methodology, these experts are from independent, non-partisan, civil society and academic organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://visionofhumanity.org/indexes/mexico-peace-index/|title=Mexico Peace Index – Vision of Humanity|last=Humanity|first=Vision of|work=Vision of Humanity|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2017 MPI found that peacefulness deteriorated by 4.3% in 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mexicoinstitute.wordpress.com/2017/04/05/institute-for-economics-and-peace-releases-2017-mexico-peace-index/|title=Institute for Economics and Peace releases 2017 Mexico Peace Index|last=mexicoinstitute|date=2017-04-05|website=Mexico Institute|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the homicide rate rose by 18.4% in the same year. Yucatán is the most peaceful state in Mexico, while Guerrero is the least peaceful state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mexiconewsdaily.com/news/peace-index-registers-first-decline-in-5-years/|title=Mexico Peace Index registers first decline in 5 years|date=2017-04-05|work=Mexico News Daily|access-date=2017-06-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data used to calculate the MPI comes from government bodies in Mexico, and IEP uses survey data collection by the national statistical office to adjust the figures for under reporting.

==Global Terrorism Index==
Another flagship report of the IEP is the [[Global Terrorism Index]] ([[Global Terrorism Index|GTI]]) which provides a comprehensive summary of the key global trends and patterns in terrorism. The report analyses data spanning the past 16 years and four editions having been released to date.

The GTI is based on data from the [[Global Terrorism Database|Global Terrorism Database (GTD)]]. It ranks 163 countries based on four indicators, those indicators are; ''number of terrorist incidents in a given year, number of fatalities from terrorist incidents in a given year, number of injuries caused by terrorist in a given year'' and ''measure of the total property damage from terrorist incidents in a given year.''

The 2016 GTI report found a ten per cent decrease in the number of deaths from terrorism in 2015 resulted in 3,389 fewer deaths than 2014, a global total of 29,376 deaths made 2015 the second deadliest year on record.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/16/world/global-terrorism-report/index.html|title=Terror attacks in developed world surge 650% in one year|last=CNN|first=Kara Fox and Dave Gilbert|website=CNN|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Economic Value of Peace ==
The [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/The-Economic-Value-of-Peace-2016-WEB.pdf Economic Value of Peace report] estimates of the economic impact of violence and conflict on the global economy.

It provides an empirical basis to calculate the potential additional economic benefits from improvements in peace. It estimates the economic impact of violence for 163 countries and independent territories representing 99.5 per cent of the global economy and population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2017/01/how-much-does-violence-really-cost-our-global-economy/|title=How much does violence really cost our global economy?|website=World Economic Forum|access-date=2017-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The global economic impact of violence was $14.3 trillion [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]] in 2016, equivalent to 12.6% of global GDP, or $1,953 per person, this figure represented the first decline in the economic impact of violence since 2011, which is the year that corresponded with the start of the Syrian war and ISIL's territorial gains in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-peace-index-idUSKBN0OX0AU20150617|title=Cost of violence hits $14 trillion in increasingly divided world|date=2015-06-17|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Global Peace Report==
On October 26, 2010, IEP and Peace and Media Tenor released “Measuring Peace in the Media”, the first study that takes a fact-based approach into understanding the accuracy of international television networks’ coverage of peace, violence and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.visionofhumanity.org/info-center/measuring-peace-in-the-media/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107121303/http://www.visionofhumanity.org/info-center/measuring-peace-in-the-media/# |archive-date=2011-01-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results show broad inconsistencies across geographies and networks, with US broadcasters much more focused on violence and conflict than their European and Middle Eastern counterparts. Al Jazeera was found to be the network providing the most balanced coverage on Afghanistan. BBC World led the way when it came to breadth of coverage. It regularly reported on 67 countries across six continents which is nearly twice as many countries as the average level of coverage.

The study analysed 37 TV news and current affairs programmes from 23 networks in 15 countries* and then cross-referenced this with the Global Peace Index which measures the levels of peace and violence in 149 countries. BBC 2 Newsnight and ZDF Heute Journal (Germany) were found to be the programmes whose editorial policies aligned their coverage most closely with the rankings of the GPI.

Positive-peace stories make up just 1.6% of the total number of stories examined in the study. These are stories that report on active steps taken to rectify violent situations. Such a small percentage may be partly related to what is considered newsworthy and dramatic, such as high-impact, violent or controversial events. However, the stereotyping of nations which are low on the GPI makes it harder for audiences to gain empathy and therefore to support governments and make headway towards creating peace.

== Positive Peace ==
Positive Peace is an innovative and empirically based framework which has been developed by IEP to identify and understand the factors which are statistically associated with peaceful and resilient societies. Positive Peace is measured by IEP on the [http://visionofhumanity.org/app/uploads/2017/02/Positive-Peace-Report-2016.pdf Positive Peace Index (PPI)].

While the Global Peace Index measures 'Negative Peace' being the absence of violence or fear of violence, Positive Peace represents the capacity for a society to meet the needs of its citizens, reduce and deal with grievances without the use of violence.

The framework is based on the quantitatively identifiable common characteristics of the world's most peaceful societies.

The defining feature of IEP’s Positive Peace framework is the [[systems approach]] to peace. IEP research has demonstrated that high levels of peacefulness are associated with strength in not just one, but all eight factors of Positive Peace. All domains are highly interrelated and work together systemically in producing a peaceful society.

== Reception ==
The [http://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1011&amp;context=think_tanks Global Go To Think Tank Index] listed the Institute for Economics and Peace as a "Think Tank to Watch", and as one of the top 20 most impactful Think Tanks worldwide with a Budget under $5 Million.

In 2013, Steve Killelea’s founding of IEP was recognized as one of the 50 most impactful philanthropic gifts in Australia’s history by a coalition including the Myer Family Company, [[Myer Foundation|The Myer Foundation]] and Sidney Myer Fund, Pro Bono Australia, [[Swinburne University]] and Philanthropy Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.probonoaustralia.com.au/news/2013/10/australia%E2%80%99s-top-50-philanthropic-gifts-all-time#sthash.HlK828IS.dpuf|title=Australia’s Top 50 Philanthropic Gifts of All Time|date=2013-10-14|publisher=ProBono Australia|accessdate=2013-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RIAN archive 667778 May 18th - International Museum Day.jpg|thumb|People visiting the [[Pushkin Museum|Pushkin Fine Arts Museum]] on International Museum Day]]
'''International Museum Day''' (IMD) is an [[international observances|international day]] a celebration that held every year on or around [[18 May]], coordinated by the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM). The event highlights a specific theme that changes every year and that is at the heart of the international museum community’s preoccupations.

The IMD provides the opportunity for museum professionals to meet the public and alert them as to the challenges that museums face. Indeed, following the definition of museums provided by ICOM, a museum is ''a non-profit, permanent institution in the service of society and its development, open to the public, which acquires, conserves, researches, communicates and exhibits the tangible and intangible heritage of humanity and its environment for the purposes of education, study and enjoyment''.{{cn|date=August 2018}} International Museum Day therefore serves as a platform to raise public awareness on the role museums play in the development of society today, on an international level.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==History==
Each year, all museums in the world are invited to participate in IMD to promote the role of museums around in the world, creating unique, enjoyable and free activities around a theme discussed within the ICOM community for this special day. 
Since its creation in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icom.museum/events/international-museum-day/|title=ICOM Website on IMD|publisher=''icom.museum''}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Museum Day has gained increasing attention. In 2009, International Museum Day attracted the participation of 20,000 museums hosting events in more than 90 countries. In 2010, 98 countries participated in the celebration, with 100 in 2011, and 30,000 museums in 129 countries in 2012.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In 2011, the official IMD poster was translated into 37 languages. Since 2012, this number jumped by one to 38.

==Timeline==

{{update section|date=October 2018}}
===International Museum Day 2007===
Museums in approximately 70 countries participated in the event. For this edition, the message that was conveyed was ''We are all responsible for universal heritage''.

====Special activities during IMD 2007====
In [[Angola]], a debate on ''The Contribution of the National Museum of [[Anthropology]] on Asserting Cultural Identity'' was organised.

'''John school''' is a form of educational intervention aimed at clients of [[prostitution|prostitutes]], who are informally known as 'johns' in North America. John schools are usually a [[diversion program]] for people - almost exclusively men - arrested for [[solicitation|soliciting]] the services of a prostitute, or another related offense. This often acts as an alternative to criminal prosecutions. However, in some jurisdictions, courts may sentence men to attend a john school program as a condition of probation.

Whether the John school is a [[diversion program]] or a sentencing condition, the client will often pay a fee to enroll. The fee frequently covers the cost of the program and sometimes contributes to programs to aid prostitutes, or community projects within [[red light districts]]. John schools often last for one day. Their focus is often on the experiences and harms of prostitution, such as the violence associated with [[prostitution]], the [[sexually transmitted disease]] risks of prostitution, and the effects of prostitution on families and communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perc.ca/PEN/1998-11/s-boddy.html "John School Helps Break the Cycle of Prostitution"] by Sharon Boddy, ''Peace and Environment News'', November 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519,hunter,63812,5.html "School for Johns"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918062417/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0519%2Chunter%2C63812%2C5.html |date=2007-09-18 }} by Aina Hunter, ''[[Village Voice]]'', May 10, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first comprehensive john school program was started in San Francisco in 1995 by the San Francisco District Attorney's Office and [[Norma Hotaling]] and was known as the First Offender Prostitution Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=May|first1=Meredith|title=Norma Hotaling dies - fought prostitution SAN FRANCISCO Former homeless prostitute's programs have been lauded, imitated around the country|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Norma-Hotaling-dies-fought-prostitution-3180057.php|accessdate=24 March 2016|publisher=SFGate|date=20 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; First time male offenders who volunteer for the program are required to attend an eight-hour seminar on the negative consequences of prostitution of all types on neighborhoods, the Criminal Justice System, and the prostitutes themselves, and face the possibility of a jail sentence if they refuse. In the first 12 years of the still ongoing program, now called the First Offender Prostitution Program, the recidivism rate amongst offenders was reduced from 8% to less than 5%. Between 1981 and 2007, 48 john schools had opened in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221894.pdf|title=Final Report on the Evaluation of the First Offender Prostitution Program, written by Michael Shiveley et al. |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 audit of the first john school in San Francisco conducted by the City's budget analysis, faults the program with ill-defined goals and no way to determine its effectiveness. Despite being touted as a national model that comes at no cost to taxpayers, the audit said the program didn't cover its expenses in each of the last five years, leading to a $270,000 shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/09/19/BAT519OMJL.DTL|title=Audit faults S.F. D.A.'s prostitution program|work=sfgate.com|accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John schools have been established across the [[United States]], in [[Canada]], [[South Korea]] and in the [[United Kingdom]]. More than 15 John schools have emerged in the United Kingdom since the first British john school in [[Leeds]] which was led by [[Julie Bindel]] and opened in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/aug/17/gender.uk?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Street fighters|publisher=[[The Guardian]], August 17, 1999|accessdate=2012-09-13|location=London|date=August 17, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the term 'john' is rarely used in the United Kingdom, john schools are referred to by several different names including kerb-crawling rehabilitation schemes or kerb-crawling awareness schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collab.northumbria.ac.uk/coo/?tag=kerbcrawling|title=Re-educating the kerb-crawler|publisher=Northumbria Centre for Offenders and Offending Blog|accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proceeds from a john school in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], Canada finance an eight-week [[Life skills-based education|life skills-based course]] for prostitutes run through Streetlight Support Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=166|title=Legalizing Misandry: From Public Shame to Systemic Discrimination Against Men|author=Paul Nathanson|author2=Katherine K.

'''Julius Stone''' (7 July 1907 – 1985) was [[Challis Professor]] of [[Jurisprudence]] and [[International Law]] at the [[University of Sydney]] from 1942 to 1972, and thereafter a visiting Professor of Law at the [[University of New South Wales]] and concurrently Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[Hastings College of Law]], [[University of California]].

He is the author of 27 books on jurisprudence and international law, and is hailed by his official biography at the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence as one of the premier legal theorists.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;[http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/juliusstone.shtml Biography of Julius Stone] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623171512/http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/juliusstone.shtml |date=23 June 2006 }}, Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence, Sydney Law School, University of Sydney.  URL accessed 5 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Stone was born in [[Leeds]], England to parents who were poor [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian Jewish]] refugees.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

==Education==
Stone received a scholarship to [[Oxford University]], where he earned Bachelor of Arts (Jurisprudence), [[Bachelor of Civil Law]] and [[Doctor of Civil Law]] degrees. He followed this with a [[Master of Laws]] from [[Leeds University]], and then a [[Doctor of Juridical Science]] from [[Harvard University]].

==Career==
Stone taught at Harvard, and briefly at Leeds, then went to [[New Zealand]] where he worked at [[Auckland University College]]. In 1942, he was appointed [[Challis Professor]] of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[University of Sydney]], a position he held until 1972. Stone's appointment was controversial for several reasons; he was perceived to have a radical jurisprudential stance, some wanted the Chair to be held open until the end of the war as it was suggested that there were suitable candidates in active service. It was suspected that the fact that he was a Jew also played a role. A debate over his appointment was carried out in both the Australian parliament and local newspapers; the Chancellor of the University, and two Fellows of the University Senate, resigned in protest.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; This early experience of [[anti-Semitism]] influenced his lifelong commitment to justice, according to his biographer, Leonie Star (Star 1993).

Stone has been described by his official ''JSIJ'' biography as having "a life-long commitment to Israel"&lt;ref name=bio/&gt; and in the ''[[Sydney Law Review]]'' as having an emotional and "fierce loyalty to the State of Israel" that led some of his colleagues to "express fear even to discuss Israel with him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kirby|first1= Michael|authorlink=Michael Kirby (judge)|year=2005 |title= Julius Stone and the Struggle for the Soul of Law |journal= [[Sydney Law Review]] |publisher= [[University of Sydney]]  |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=323, 332 |url= http://sydney.edu.au/law/slr/docs_pdfs/editions/slr_v27_n2.pdf |accessdate=17 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Stone moved to the [[University of New South Wales]], where he was a visiting Professor of Law until his death in 1985. While at University of New South Wales, he concurrently held the position of Distinguished Professor of Jurisprudence and International Law at the [[Hastings College of Law]], [[University of California]].

In 1999, 15 years after Stone's death, the University of Sydney established an institute of jurisprudence which was named after him, the Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence.&lt;ref name="stone_inst"&gt;[http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614004212/http://www.law.usyd.edu.au/jurisprudence/ |date=14 June 2006 }} Accessed 21 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Stone influenced generations of lawyers who studied at University of Sydney. For most of his time there, the Law School was a practice-based school and students learnt what they needed to become practising lawyers. According to A J Brown of Griffith University, the former [[Justice]] of the [[High Court of Australia]] [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] was heavily influenced at university by Stone. [http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,24992503-5001030,00.html]

===Israeli settlements===
Stone's view is that [[Israeli settlements]] in the [[West Bank]] are legal under international law, and do not constitute a violation of the [[Fourth Geneva Convention]] (Article 49(6)). He stated:

"Irony would...be pushed to the absurdity of claiming that Article 49(6), designed to prevent repetition of Nazi-type genocidal policies of rendering Nazi metropolitan territories judenrein, has now come to mean that...the West Bank...must be made judenrein and must be so maintained, if necessary by the use of force by the government of Israel against its own inhabitants. Common sense as well as correct historical and functional context excludes so tyrannical a reading of Article 49(6.)"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=1&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=378&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=5603&amp;TTL=The_Settlements_Issue:_Distorting_the_Geneva_Convention_and_the_Oslo_Accords The Settlements Issue: Distorting the Geneva Convention and the Oslo Accords ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
*Award of the American Society of International Law (1956).
*Honorary life member of the American Society of International Law (1962). 
*[[Swiney Prize for Jurisprudence]] from the [[Royal Society of Arts]] (1964).
*World Research Award from the Washington Conference on World Peace through Law (1965).
*The Julius Stone Institute of Jurisprudence at Sydney Law School, [[University of Sydney]] is named in his honour.

==Criticism==
Stone has been criticised for his views in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] by [[Ben Saul]], saying: "Many of Stone’s positions on critical international legal issues in the Israel/Palestine conflict stepped outside even generous zones of plausible or reasonable interpretations of the law, even on the law as it then often ambiguously stood, and certainly in hindsight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ben Saul|year=2009|title=Julius Stone and the Question of Palestine in International Law|journal=Legal Studies Research Paper|issue= 09/106|pages=Abstract|publisher=University of Sidney|ssrn=1485056|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public legal education, sometimes called civics education, comprises a range of activities intended to build public awareness and skills related to [[law]] and the justice system. This term also refers to the fields of practice and [[wikt:study|study]] concerned with those activities, and to a social and professional [[social movement|movement]] that advocates greater societal commitment to [[education|educating]] people about the law. Anna-Marie Marshall explains that  "in order to realize their rights, people need to take the initiative to articulate them. This initiative, in turn, depends on the availability and the relevance of legal schema to people confronting problems." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marshall|first1=Anna-Marie|title=Idle Rights: Employees’ Rights Consciousness and the Construction of Sexual Harassment Policies.|journal=Law and Society Review|date=2005|volume=39|issue=1|pages=83–124|doi=10.1111/j.0023-9216.2005.00078.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because laws exist as part of a larger organizational ecosystem in which the interests of the organization as well as those of the actors become inextricably linked to the ways in which they are enacted.
 
Distinct from the education of students in [[law school]] seeking a degree in law (which is often simply called "[[legal education]]") and the [[continuing education#Continuing education for professionals|continuing professional education]] of [[lawyer]]s and [[judge]]s (which is sometimes called "[[continuing legal education]]"), public legal education is principally aimed at people who are not lawyers, judges, or degree-seeking law students.

The term "public legal education" (PLE) is related to, and may encompass, several similar terms.&lt;ref&gt;

The term "law-related education" (LRE) usually refers to public legal education in [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education|secondary]] schools (and sometimes in [[higher education]]), as opposed to PLE for adults and outside of school.&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Wanda (2000). "Law-Related Education: Promoting Awareness, Participation, and Action", 297–98, in ''Weaving Connections: Educating for Peace, Social and Environmental Justice'' (Tara Goldstein &amp; David Selby, eds.). {{ISBN|1-894549-01-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
According to the [[American Bar Association]], Commission on Public Understanding, legal awareness is, "the ability to make critical judgments about the substance of the law, the legal process, and available legal resources and to effectively utilize the legal system and articulate strategies to improve it is legal literacy".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

The [[Canadian Bar Association]] (1992, 23) defines legal literacy as, "the ability to understand words used in a legal context, to draw conclusions from them, and then to use those conclusions to take action."&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Good Citizens: Literacy Training in Anxious Time. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 2014. Project MUSE. Web. Feb. 2015. &lt;http://muse.jhu.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

With little change to the Multiple Action Research Group's(MARG, an NGO working for the promotion of legal awareness) definition, legal awareness can be defined as, "critical knowledge of legal provisions and processes, coupled with the skills to use this knowledge to respect and realize rights and entitlements".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;&lt;ref name="MARG"&gt;[http://www.ngo-marg.org/legal-awareness Multiple Action Research Group - Justice through research empowerment] (Accessed on 2 Apr 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thought, philosophy, and different approaches to legal literacy==

The "continuum approach" considers legal literacy as, "a capacity spread along a continuum, with lawyers and judges at one end and relatively incapable laypersons at the other". This approach was adopted by the legal scholar White who considered legal literacy to mean, "that degree of competence in legal discourse required for meaningful and active life in our increasingly [[legal culture|legalistic and litigious culture]]".&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

Author Bilder (1999) defines legal literacy as a, "spectrum of functional skills", related to the conduct of [[litigation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Bilder1999, 51)&lt;/ref&gt; The continuum approach explains, "a certain degree of legal literacy is required for effective participation in modern society, but it is not necessary for the average citizen to reach the professional standard of 'thinking (and writing) like a lawyer.'"&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

One of the recent approaches considers legal literacy as a metaphor. According to this view, the term is "intended to suggest some parallels between the institution of the law, and a system of language to be mastered, knowledge gained and understanding achieved".&lt;ref&gt;(Manley-Casimir, Michael E., Wanda M. Cassidy, and Suzanne de Castell 1986, 47)&lt;/ref&gt; These authors suggest that the term legal literacy can also function as a model for educators who seek to promote such literacy. Proponents of legal literacy may thus look to the teaching of language for guidance.&lt;ref name=WILL/&gt;

==Need and importance==
Anoop Kumar, a researcher of Legal Literacy Mission, says in his study, "the legislature of the state and the parliament, while enacting the legislation, consider the objectives of it. Some laws lay down the substantive rights of the masses and some touch upon the procedural aspect of certain laws. But it is due to lack of awareness of beneficiaries that most of the legislations are ineffective at the stage of their execution."&lt;ref&gt;Kumar, Anoop, Social science research network National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis {{doi|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beljaars, Ben. "Implementing Legal Information Literacy: A Challenge for the Curriculum", International Journal of Legal Information. Journal. Feb. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal awareness can empower people to demand justice, accountability and effective remedies at all levels.&lt;ref name=MARG/&gt; Legal needs always stand to become crisis oriented because their ignorance prevents them from anticipating legal troubles and approaching a lawyer for consultation and advice in time. This magnifies the impact of their legal troubles and difficulties when they come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hslsa.nic.in/Resume.htm Justice P.N. Bhagwati, In 1986, in case of Sukhdas V. Union Territory of Arunachal Pradesh, reported in AIR 1986 S.C. at page 991, Justice P.N. Bhagwat]&lt;/ref&gt;

Without (legal) literacy people can get intimidated and alienated from law. This may evolve into a situation which results in people coming into conflict with the law, or being unable to obtain help from it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Canadian Bar Association 1992)]&lt;/ref&gt; Courts have acknowledged the barrier raised by a lack of literacy to asserting guaranteed rights effectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (The John Howard Society of Canada1996)]&lt;/ref&gt; Low literacy may block people’s access to justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (Council of Canadian Administrative Tribunals 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; At times, literacy requirements have been used to block access to rights and benefits&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf (South Carolina v. Katzenbach (No. 22, Orig.))]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Preber, B. J. Financial Expert Witness Communication: A Practical Guide to Reporting and Testimony, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. May 2014.

===Goals and objectives===
[[File:Womens read about their legal rights in a public awareness campaing (Benin) (5579786047).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Women read about their legal rights in a public awareness campaign ([[Benin]])]]

Goals of the legal literacy programs can be broadly divided in three types. Namely educational, competency and critical.&lt;ref name="www2.athabascau.ca"&gt;http://www2.athabascau.ca/syllabi/lgst/docs/LGST249_sample.pdf Retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Reading the Legal World'', author Laird Hunter expects legal literacy to achieve:&lt;ref name="ssrn.com"&gt;Kumar, Anoop, National Legal Literacy Mission - An Evaluative Analysis (March 26, 2013). {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.2240008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"People using the legal system must be able to guide themselves through a process that they understand [...] and, at appropriate places along the way"
*recognize they have a [[Natural and legal rights|legal right]] or [[Law of obligations|responsibility]], in order to exercise or assume it;
*recognize when a problem or conflict is a legal conflict and when a legal solution is available;
*know how to take the necessary action to avoid problems and where this is not possible, how to help themselves appropriately;
*know how and where to find information on the law, and be able to find information that is accessible to them,
* know when and how to obtain suitable legal assistance;
* have confidence that the legal system will provide a remedy, and
* understand the process clearly enough to perceive that justice has been done

Depending on the goals there can be a number of objectives for legal literacy programs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lawforlife.org.uk/introduction/cambodian-community-empowerment-and-legal-awareness-programme,10181,FP.html retrieved 31 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods adopted to promote legal awareness===
There have been many cases where governments have promoted long-term legal literacy missions or awareness campaigns. An example of this is when institutions arrange legal literacy events.

Legal awareness is also achieved through camps, lectures, and interactive workshops or crash programs on the essential and elementary legal laws. Among the general public, many wish to spend time listening to scholars on contemporary issues that have significant bearing on the rights and livelihood of ordinary people.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt; Other methods are road shows, radio talks, street and theatre plays, as well as the publication of relevant books, periodicals, posters, and charts that deal with particular laws, the distribution of pamphlets, brochures, and stickers, the display of paintings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal Aid and Literacy Cell|url=http://www.symlaw.ac.in/legal-aid-and-literacy-cell.php|website=symlaw.ac.in|accessdate=21 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrations in comics,&lt;ref name="morungexpress"&gt;{{cite news|title = Legal awareness through grassroots comics|url = http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|accessdate = 8 December 2014|publisher = morungexpress.com|date = November 11, 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141211044243/http://www.morungexpress.com/local/124381.html|archive-date = 11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other ways to ensure publicity for various [[legal mobilisation]] activities.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

Strategically located display boards in public places (railway stations, bus stations, market places, in front of major government offices and police stations) are also used to help government officials, police, and the public to understand the spirit of law.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

==Obstacles==
According to Lorenzo Cotula, laws are usually published in the official gazette, few people outside legal circles have access to [[legal information]].&lt;ref name=Cotula&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotula|first1=Lorenzo|title=Legal Empowerment for Local Resource Control: Securing Local Resource Rights Within Foreign Investment Projects in Africa|date=1 Jan 2007|publisher=IIED, 2007|isbn=9781843696674|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-72KOAj92UgC&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=legal%20awareness&amp;pg=PR2#v=onepage&amp;q=legal%20awareness&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illiteracy,&lt;ref name="Cotula" /&gt; economic barriers,&lt;ref name="UNSG"&gt;[http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/Poverty/A-67-278.pdf  " Report of the Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights" page 6 from Note by the Secretary-General on Extreme poverty and human rights for UN GA 67th session A67/278 Distri:General 9 Aug 2012]  www.ohchr.org webpage retrieved 30 March 2013 16.00 IST&lt;/ref&gt; language barriers, social taboos&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=irvxAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;dq=Obstacles+in+%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5xBXUffCA4fXrQeHhIGoAg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgo Arise: A Women's Developmental Magazine Published by Acfode, Issues 2-16 ] snippet view as seen/referred to on 30 March 2013 on Google books&lt;/ref&gt; and a lack of zeal among the legal fraternity may lead to obstacles in gaining requisite levels of legal literacy. According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, at times lack of zeal among lawyers make them prone to saying no and killing a deal rather than working through the issues and finding solutions that are both practical and legally sound.&lt;ref name="HannaHK"&gt;{{cite book| first = Hanna | last = Hasl-Kelchner| title = The business guide to legal literacy: what every manager should know about the law| isbn = 9780787982553 | year = 2006| pages = 1–12 &amp; inside flap page|accessdate=9 Nov 2013| url = http://www.legalliteracybooktour.com/LegalLiteracy-FreeChapters.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a note to the UN General Assembly 67th session, the UN Secretary General states, "the deprivations that persons living in poverty encounter throughout their lives — lack of access to quality education, reduced access to information, limited political voice and social capital — translate into lower levels of legal literacy and awareness of their rights, creating social obstacles to seeking redress".&lt;ref name=UNSG/&gt;

The absence of a [[legal culture]] and the resulting illiteracy are the main reasons for the large number of cases in the courts. If the accused citizen knows that an act is a crime punishable by law, they may not do it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130413235533/http://main.omanobserver.om/node/89239 |archivedate=2013-04-13 |df= }} website retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the domain of law a vast category of users need to exchange [[legal information]] worldwide and carry out activities in a context where a common understanding of law beyond language is highly desirable. However, this requirement is hard to meet, due to the variety of languages and modes in which the legal discourse is expressed as well as to the diversity of legal orders and the legal concepts on which these systems are founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webfolder.eurac.edu/EURAC/LexALP_shared/media/Peruginelli.pdf Multilingual Legal Information Access: an Overview- Ginevra Peruginelli] Retrieved 30 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

About lesser significance to legal literacy in US legal education, Leonard J. Long professor of law, [[Quinnipiac University School of Law]] says, "law students, law firms, consumers of legal services, and society as a whole would benefit from having a legal profession comprised and dominated by people who are literate in American law, its history, and its jurisprudence. But legal literacy is not promoted mainly because it is not viewed as necessary for the practice of law. This is part of the anti-intellectual tradition in American law generally, and in American legal education specifically".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.siu.edu/journal/34fall/1%20-%20Long.pdf RESISTING ANTI -INTELLECTUALISM AND PROMOTING LEGAL LITERACY by Leonard J.

==Institutional and corporate legal literacy==
Corporate, institutions and NGOs are subject to and are supposed to follow various sets of laws.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Corporate legal literacy===
Legal awareness is an important part of professional work life.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=1T5BHBHNNN0C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=%22legal+awareness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=j2--T8XgEY3JrQeY-qW1DQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBTi0AQ&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Akula, when law-sensitive issues arise, corporate executives often find themselves in what is, for them, unmapped territory, often without requisite law training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iedp.com/Blog/Importance_Legal_Literacy_Executives_MITSloan The Importance of Legal Literacy for Executives-John Akula, Senior lecturer in Law at MIT Sloan School of Management] Retrieved 31 March 2013 13.00pm IST&lt;/ref&gt; When corporate executives work with attorneys they need to develop a common language to bridge probable communication gaps to achieve legal astituteness.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=I2ezeH8IpSgC&amp;pg=PR16&amp;dq=need+of+legal+literacy+to+corporate+executives&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qO9XUcrEJ4OsrAeM5YGgCQ&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=need%20of%20legal%20literacy%20to%20corporate%20executives&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hanna Hasl-Kelchner, legal literacy can help to bridge the gap between law and business by simplifying legal terms into language that makes business sense and offers a new way to think about the law as a useful business tool.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;
She says, "corporate legal literacy involves balanced understanding of cross disciplinary influences bringing in legal risk exposure, avoiding lawsuits and transforming potential business legal issues that threaten growth and profitability, into opportunities for building stronger business relationships, delivering sustainable stakeholder value, improving competitive advantage and foremost embedding compliance into the corporate culture to achieve organizational excellence".&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

According to Hasl-Kelchner, corporate legal literacy tackles companies' legal risk profiles on both the employee and organizational levels. There is a need to identify the infrastructure needed to support legal literacy and promote effective communications throughout the organization.&lt;ref name=HannaHK/&gt;

===Institutional legal literacy===
George Pulikuthiyil, executive director of NGO Jananeethi in his essay ''Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment'' says that, 'Well educated and highly placed professionals too are often not aware of provisions in laws and implications of their violations. Many would not know the nitty-gritty of several statutory laws and their applications.&amp;nbsp;... However, the fact remains that vast majority of the officers and professionals like clinical psychologists, therapeutic counsellors, welfare officers, social workers, institutional heads and academia are ignorant of their role and responsibilities as contemplated in the Act. NGOs do take pains to organize workshops to sensitize them with respect to such new generation legislations wherein the pro-active role of various stake holders are great significance.' &lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pulikuthiyil|first1=George|title=Legal Literacy for Social Empowerment|url=http://www.jananeethi.org/jananeethi/reports/esseylegalliteracy.htm|publisher=jananeethi.org/|accessdate=2 December 2014|quote=Bare-foot lawyers/para-legal activists"There may be para-legal workers specially trained in specific thrust areas like minorities, indigenous people, child rights, gender issues, right to information, consumer rights, torture and custodial violence etc. "}}&lt;/ref&gt; George Pulikuthiyil further believes non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, faith groups, various service providers, trade unions, youth clubs, police personnel, elected representatives to local bodies, PG students of social work and service organizations also have larger scope of improving the quality of life provided they are made conversant with respective legislations.&lt;ref name=Pulikuthiyil/&gt;

===Designated legal officers===
Apart from external legal advisors, [[General counsel|internal legal officers]]&lt;ref name="ACC"&gt;The 2011 In-House Counsel Compensation Survey, Question 10,[http://www.acc.com/chapters/socal/upload/2011-In-House-Counsel-Compensation-Survey_4-13-11.pdf] Profiles of In-House Counsel 2006 [http://www.acc.com/vl/public/Surveys/loader.cfm?csModule=security/getfile&amp;amp;pageid=16297] Who Does Your Counsel Report To? (2001) (The Majority Report to the CEO)[http://www.acc.com/legalresources/resource.cfm?show=145939]&lt;/ref&gt;  and in certain countries like Australia and India, The [[company secretary]] is responsible for advising on good governance practices and compliance of corporate governance norms as prescribed under various corporate, securities and other business laws, regulations and guidelines made thereunder.&lt;ref name=whatis&gt;[http://www.companysecretary.com.au/articles/WhatIsCS.pdf What is a Company Secretary?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=csindia&gt;[http://www.icsi.edu/Student/ROLEOFCOMPANYSECRETARY.aspx ROLE OF COMPANY SECRETARY]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related concepts==
There are certain related concepts including [[legal consciousness]], [[legal mobilization]] and [[legal socialization]], [[Empowerment#Legal empowerment|legal empowerment]], that helps to put legal literacy in perspective.&lt;ref name="www2.athabascau.ca"/&gt;

===Civics and socio-legal literacy===
Despite semantic proximity education of [[civics]], civics literacy and legal literacy are not exactly the same. In the "legal literacy" semantic components are the dominant notion of the "right," "law," "responsibility to the law," and "civic literacy" added to them the concept of "civil society", "individual rights and freedoms" and "man's responsibility to civil society".&lt;ref&gt;http://academia.lndb.lv/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/1173/natalia-gendina-eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the formal civic education system, human rights can be taken up as a part of civic education, values education and social studies, though they may have the limitation of presenting only certain aspects of human rights rather than their integrated whole, and duties of citizens may be overly emphasized to the detriment of certain rights and freedoms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurights.or.jp/english/education/overview-human-rights-education-in-the-asia-pacific.html&lt;/ref&gt;

At the elementary school level, usually minimal level legal literacy introduction is taught through [[civics]], but which is not necessarily adequate for the rest of life.&lt;ref name="Civic Education, Crittenden &amp; Levine"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crittenden|first1=Jack|last2=Levine|first2=Peter|title=Civic Education|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/civic-education/|website=plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=22 June 2017|page=Para 2 and also para 1|date=27 December 2007&lt;!--substantive revision Thu May 30, 2013--&gt;|quote=Paragraph no. 2  Nevertheless, most scholarship that uses the phrase “civic education” investigates deliberate programs of instruction within schools or colleges,...........Nevertheless, it is important not to lose sight of the fact that civic education takes place at all stages of life and in many venues other than schools.  also Para 1  ...It is certainly not limited to schooling and the education of children and youth.

==Internet and legal literacy==
The Internet as a [[legal research|legal research tool]] is advantageous for most primary legal research materials, which can be located for free to supplement fee-based services and library collections. The Internet offers increased access to resources, low- or no-cost access, and real-time information via social media.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aallnet.org/main-menu/Publications/products/Law-Librarians-Making-Information-Work/pll-guide-5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, MARG(Multiple Action Research Group), an organization working for [[empowerment#Legal|empowerment]] is using internet and social networking sites to empower netizens. The organization posts  every Friday "friday facts" in their [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] &amp; [[Instagram]] pages.These posts/pictures focuses on rights of the citizens and all other important information about laws in India.

==Important institutions promoting legal awareness and legal literacy==
[[Bar council]]s, lawyer federations and various NGOs take the lead in promoting legal awareness and legal literacy. In India, as per the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, the [[National Legal Services Authority]] (NLSA) has been designated to take appropriate measures for spreading legal literacy and legal awareness amongst the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html The act as seen on 26 Feb 2013 14.30 GMT] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729091927/http://nalsa.gov.in/actrules.html |date=2016-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indiana]], in the United States, Outreach for Legal Literacy (OLL) is a community service program in which law students teach law to fifth-graders in local elementary schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.indiana.edu/students/activities/outreach/index.shtml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328142637/http://law.indiana.edu/students/activities/outreach/index.shtml |archivedate=2013-03-28 |df= }} Retrieved 31 March 2013 14.00pm IST&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal tests are often formulated from the logical analysis of a judicial decision or a court order where it appears that a [[finder of fact]] or the [[court]] made a particular decision after contemplating a well-defined set of circumstances. It is assumed that evaluating any given set of circumstances under a legal test will lead to an unambiguous and repeatable result. &lt;!-- this needs to be clarified --&gt;

London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;, a new psychological theory of [[consciousness]], and leader of the [[Vygotsky Circle]] (also referred to as "Vygotsky-[[Alexander Luria|Luria]] Circle").

Despite his claim for a "new psychology" that he foresaw as a "science of the Superman" of the [[Communism|Communist future]], Vygotsky's main work was in [[developmental psychology]] and he proposed a theory of the development of "higher psychological functions" that saw human psychological development as emerging through interpersonal connections and actions with the social environment. During an earlier [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] and [[Reductionism|reductionist]] "instrumental psychology" period of his career (1920s), he argued that human psychological development can be formed through the use of meaningless (i.e., virtually random) signs that he viewed as psychological equivalent of instrument use in human labor and industry.&lt;ref name="revBook"/&gt; Later, in the "[[Holism|holistic]]" period of his career (first half of 1930s), Vygotsky rejected his earlier reductionist views on signs. Under the increasing influence from the holistic thinking of the scholars primarily associated with German-American [[Gestalt psychology]] movement Vygotsky adopted their views on "psychological systems" and—inspired by [[Kurt Lewin]]'s "[[Field theory (psychology)|Topological (and vector) psychology]]"—introduced the vague notion of the "[[zone of proximal development]]". It was during this period that he identified play of young children as their "leading activity", that he understood as the main source of preschoolers psychological development, which he viewed as the inseparable unity of emotional, volitional, and cognitive development. 

As early as in mid-1920s, Vygotsky's ideas were introduced in the West, but he remained virtually unknown until the early 1980s when the popularity among educators of the developmental psychology of [[Jean Piaget]] (1896-1980) started to decline and, in contrast, Vygotsky's notion of the "zone of proximal development" became a central component of the development of the so-called "[[Social constructivism|social constructivist]]" turn in developmental and, primarily, educational psychology and practice. A ''[[Review of General Psychology]]'' study, published in 2002, ranked Vygotsky as the 83rd top psychologist of the twentieth century and the third (and the last) Russian on the top-100 list after [[Ivan Pavlov]] and Vygotsky's longtime collaborator [[Alexander Luria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haggbloom |first=Steven J. |last2=''et al.'' |title=The 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century |journal=Review of General Psychology |volume=6 |issue=2 |year=2002 |pages=139–152 |doi=10.1037/1089-2680.6.2.139 |url=http://www.apa.org/monitor/julaug02/eminent.aspx |first2=Renee |last3=Warnick |first3=Jason E. |last4=Jones |first4=Vinessa K. |last5=Yarbrough |first5=Gary L. |last6=Russell |first6=Tenea M. |last7=Borecky |first7=Chris M. |last8=McGahhey |first8=Reagan |last9=Powell |first9=John L., III| displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early twenty-first century has seen scholarly reevaluations of the popular version of Vygotsky's legacy (sometimes termed "Vygotsky cult", "the cult of Vygotsky", or even "the cult of personality around Vygotsky"), which is referred to as the "revisionist revolution in Vygotsky Studies".&lt;ref name="revBook"&gt;Yasnitsky, A. &amp; van der Veer, R.

The studies conducted in the framework of the "revisionist turn" in Vygotsky studes in the decade of 2010s revealed not only systematic and massive falsifications and distortions of Vygotsky's legacy, but also demonstrated rapid decrease of this author's popularity in international scholarship that started in 2016-2017 and the downfall even further accelerated in 2018у&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=djqLs50AAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=djqLs50AAAAJ:umqufdRvDiIC Michael Cole’s (and Lev Vygotsky’s) ''Mind in society'' (1978): Google Scholar citation rate]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/15934.html psyanimajournal: ''Vygotsky Bubble in 2017: The Year of the Great Break!'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/16496.html psyanimajournal: ''Vygotsky Cult in figures and the Vygotsky Bubble: the 3rd Anniversary of the project!'']&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Biography==
Lev Vygotsky was born to the Vygodskii family in the town of [[Orsha]], [[Belarus]] (then belonging to [[Russian Empire]]) into a non-religious middle-class family of [[Russian Jews|Russian Jewish]] extraction. His father Simkha Vygodskii was a banker. Young Lev Vygodskii was raised in the city of [[Gomel]], where he was homeschooled until 1911 and then obtained formal degree (with distinction) in a private Jewish Gimnasium, which allowed him entrance to a university. In 1913 Lev Vygodskii was admitted to the [[Moscow University]] by mere ballot through a "[[Jewish quota#Countries legislating limitations on the admission of Jewish students|Jewish Lottery]]": at the time a three percent Jewish student quota was administered for entry in Moscow and Saint Petersburg universities. He had interest in humanities and social sciences, but at the insistence of his parents he applied to the medical school in Moscow University. During the first semester of study he transferred to the law school. There he studied law and, in parallel, he attended lectures at fully official, but privately funded and non degree granting Shaniavskii [[:ru:Московский городской народный университет имени А. Л. Шанявского|Moscow City People's University]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Shaniavskii+University Shaniavskii University]&lt;/ref&gt; His early interests were in the arts and, primarily, in the topics of the history of the Jewish people, the tradition, culture and Jewish identity. In contrast, during this period he was highly critical of the ideas of both [[socialism]] and [[Zionism]], and proposed the solution of the "Jewish question" by return to the traditional Jewish Orthodoxy.

Lev Vygodskii never completed his formal studies at the [[Imperial Moscow University]] and, thus, he never obtained a university degree: his studies were interrupted by the October Bolshevik uprising in 1917 in the country's capital Petrograd and the second largest city Moscow. Following these events, he left Moscow and eventually returned to Gomel, where he lived after the [[October Revolution|October Socialist Revolution]] of 1917 occurred. There is virtually no information about his life during the years in Gomel (that administratively belonged to the [[Ukrainian State]] at the time) after the German occupation during the [[WWI]], until the Bolsheviks captured the town in 1919. Since then he was an active participant of major social transformation under the Bolshevik (Communist) rule and a fairly prominent representative of the Bolshevik government in Gomel from 1919 to 1923. By the early 1920s, as reflected in his journalistic publications of the time, he informally changed his Jewish-sounding birth name, 'Lev Símkhovich Výgodskii' ({{lang-rus|Лев Си́мхович Вы́годский}}), with the surname becoming ''Vygótskii'' and the [[Russian patronymic|patronymic]] 'Símkhovich' becoming the Slavic 'Semiónovich'. It was under this pen-name that the fame subsequently came to him. His daughters (subsequently born in 1925 and 1930)  and other relatives, though, preserved their original family name 'Vygodskii'. The traditional English spelling of his last name nowadays is 'Vygotsky'.&lt;ref name="bioBook"/&gt;

In January 1924, Vygotsky took part in the Second All-Russian Psychoneurological Congress in [[Petrograd]] (soon thereafter renamed [[Leningrad]]). After the Congress, Vygotsky received an invitation to become a research fellow at the Psychological Institute in Moscow. Vygotsky moved to Moscow with his new wife, Roza Smekhova. He began his career at the Psychological Institute as a "staff scientist, second class".&lt;ref&gt;Van der Veer, R., &amp; Valsiner, J. (1991). [https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/10170 Understanding Vygotsky. A quest for synthesis]. Oxford: Basil Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 1925, Vygotsky completed his dissertation in 1925 entitled, "The Psychology of Art", that was not published until the 1960s and a book entitled, "Pedagogical Psychology", that apparently was created on the basis of lecture notes that he prepared in Gomel while he was a psychology instructor at local educational establishments. In summer 1925 he made his first and only trip abroad to a London congress on the education of the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;van der Veer, R. &amp; Zavershneva, E. (2011).

After his release from hospital Vygotsky did theoretical and methodological work on the crisis in psychology, but never finished the draft of the manuscript and interrupted his work on it around mid-1927. The manuscript was published later with notable editorial interventions and distortions in 1982 and presented by the editors as one of the most important Vygotsky's works.&lt;ref name="Zavershneva, E 2009"&gt;Zavershneva, E. 2009.

Vygotsky. ''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology'', vol. 50, no. 4, July–August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In this early manuscript, Vygotsky argued for the formation of a general psychology that could unite the naturalist objectivist strands of psychological science with the more philosophical approaches of Marxist orientation. However, he also harshly criticized those of his colleagues who attempted to build a "[[Marxism|Marxist]] Psychology" as an alternative to the naturalist and philosophical schools. He argued that if one wanted to build a truly Marxist Psychology, there were no shortcuts to be found by merely looking for applicable quotes in the writings of [[Karl Marx|Marx]]. Rather one should look for a methodology that was in accordance with the Marxian spirit.&lt;ref name="Kozulin1986"&gt;Kozulin, Alex. 1986. "Vygotsky in Context" in Vygotsky L. "Thought and Language", MIT Press. pp. xi - lvii&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926-30 Vygotsky worked on a research programme investigating the development of higher cognitive functions of logical memory, selective attention, decision making, and language comprehension, from early forms of primal psychological functions. During this period he gathered a group of collaborators including [[Alexander Luria]], Boris Varshava, [[Alexei Leontiev]], [[Leonid Zankov]], and several others. Vygotsky guided his students in researching this phenomenon from three different perspectives: 
* The instrumental approach, which tried to understand the ways humans use objects as mediation aids in memory and reasoning
*A developmental approach, focused on how children acquire higher cognitive functions during development
* A culture-historical approach, studying how social and cultural patterns of interaction shape forms of mediation and developmental trajectories &lt;ref name="Kozulin1986"/&gt;

In the early 1930s Vygotsky experienced deep crisis, personal and theoretical, and after a period of massive self-criticism made an attempt at a radical revision of his theory. The work of the representatives of the [[Gestalt psychology]] and other holistic scholars was instrumental in this theoretical shift. In 1932-1934 Vygotsky was aiming at establishing a psychological theory of consciousness, but because of his death this theory remained only in a very sketchy and unfinished form.

==Life and scientific legacy==
Vygotsky was a pioneering psychologist and his major works span six separate volumes, written over roughly ten years, from ''Psychology of Art'' (1925) to ''Thought and Language'' [or ''Thinking and Speech''] (1934). Vygotsky's interests in the fields of [[developmental psychology]], [[child development]], and [[education]] were extremely diverse. His philosophical framework includes interpretations of the cognitive role of mediation tools, as well as the re-interpretation of well-known concepts in psychology such as [[internalization]] of knowledge. Vygotsky introduced the notion of [[zone of proximal development]], a metaphor capable of describing the potential of human cognitive development. His work covered topics such as the origin and the [[psychology of art]], development of higher [[mental function]]s, [[philosophy of science]] and the [[Methodology|methodology of psychological research]], the relation between [[learning]] and [[Developmental psychology|human development]], concept formation, interrelation between [[language and thought]] development, play as a psychological phenomenon, [[learning disabilities]], and abnormal human development (aka ''defectology''). His scientific thinking underwent several major transformations throughout his career, but generally Vygotsky's legacy may be divided into two fairly distinct periods,{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} and the transitional phase between the two during which Vygotsky experienced the crisis in his theory and personal life. These are the [[mechanism (philosophy)|mechanistic]] "instrumental" period of the 1920s, integrative "[[Holism|holistic]]" period of the 1930s, and the transitional years of, roughly, 1929-1931. Each of these periods is characterized by its distinct themes and theoretical innovations.

==="Instrumental" period (1920s)===

====Cultural mediation and internalization====
Vygotsky studied child development and the significant roles of [[cultural mediation]] and [[interpersonal communication]]. He observed how higher mental functions developed through these interactions, and also represented the shared knowledge of a culture. This process is known as [[internalization]]. ''Internalization'' may be understood in one respect as "knowing how". For example, the practices of riding a bicycle or pouring a cup of milk initially, are outside and beyond the child. The mastery of the skills needed for performing these practices occurs through the activity of the child within society. A further aspect of internalization is ''appropriation'', in which children take tools and adapt them to personal use, perhaps using them in unique ways. Internalizing the use of a pencil allows the child to use it very much for personal ends rather than drawing exactly what others in society have drawn previously.

===The period of crisis, criticism, and self-criticism (1929–1932)===

In 1930s Vygotsky was engaged in massive reconstruction of his theory of his "instrumental" period of the 1920s. Around 1929-1930 he realized numerous deficiencies and imperfections of the earlier work of the Vygotsky Circle and criticized it on a number of occasions: in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. self-criticism of 1929: "I am revising the s[econd] part of "monkey"[i.e., the book Ape, primitive, and child]. Alas! The f[irst] chapter is written wholly according to the Freudianists [...]; then the impenetrable Piaget is turned into an absolute beyond all measure; instrument and sign are mixed together even more, and so on and so forth. This is not the fault of A. R. [Luria] personally, but of the entire "epoch" of our thinking. We need to put a stop to this unrelentingly. [...] Let there be the most rigorous, monastic regime of thought; ideological seclusion, if necessary. And let us demand the same of others. Let us explain that studying cultural psychology is no joke, not something to do at odd moments or among other things, and not grounds for every new person’s own conjectures".

Their structure and the system of their development remain the same. What is changed and modified are rather the relationships, the links between the functions. New constellations emerge which were unknown in the preceding stage". In: Vygotsky, L. S. (1930/1997). On psychological systems. In R. W. Rieber &amp; J. Wollock (Eds.), The collected works of L. S. Vygotsky (Vol. 3. Problems of the Theory and History of Psychology, pp. 91-108). New York: Plenum Press&lt;/ref&gt; in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;From the letter to A. R. Luria, from Moscow, June 12, 1931: "I am still beset with thousands of petty chores. The fruitlessness of what I do greatly distresses me. My scientific thinking is going off into the realm of fantasy, and I cannot think things through in a realistic way to the end. Nothing is going right: I am doing the wrong things, writing the wrong things, saying the wrong things. A fundamental reorganization is called for—and this time I am going to carry it out." In:  Vygotsky, L. S. (2007). Letters to students and colleagues. ''Journal of Russian and East European Psychology'', 45(2), 11-60. doi:10.2753/RPO1061-0405450201, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky, archival document of mid-1932 titled "Consciousness without word": "'''Our deficiency is not a deficiency of facts, but the untenability of the theory''': in the analysis of our crisis this is the main difficulty, but not a departure from facts. '''This is ''contra'' A[.]N.[Leontiev.]''' '''Consequently''': salvation is not in the facts but in the theory. We introduced the systemic point of view '''too late'''... '''Now''' I understand all this more deeply" (Zavershneva, 2010b, p. 54)&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Vygotsky criticized his earlier idea of radical separation between the "lower" and "higher" psychological functions and, around 1932, appears to abandon it.&lt;ref&gt;Vygotsky in his presentation of December, 1932, a year and half before his death: "1. The necessity of a new stage of inquiry does not stem from the fact that a new thought has occurred to me or a new idea has caught my interest, but from the necessity of developing the research itself—new facts prod me into searching for new and more intricate explanations. The narrowness, bias, and schematism of the old mindset led us to the wrong assessment of the essential principles that we mistook for the secondary ones: interfunctional connections. We focused attention on the sign (on the tool) to the detriment of the operation with it, representing it as something simple, which goes through three phases: magical—external—internal. But the knot is external  and the teenager’s diary is external. Hence we have a sea of poorly explained facts and a desire to delve more deeply into the facts, i.e., to evaluate them theoretically in a different way.
2. The higher and lower functions are not constructed in two tiers: their number and names do not match. But our previous understanding was not right, either[, according to which] a higher function is the mastery of the lower ([e.g.,] voluntary attention is the subordination to it of involuntary attention) because this means exactly—in two tiers". Vygotsky’s record titled "Symposium, December 4, 1932", see in Zavershneva, E. 2010b. The Vygotsky Family Archive: New Findings. Notebooks, Notes, and Scientific Journals of L.S. Vygotsky (1912–1934). ''Journal of the Russian and East European Psychology'' 48 (1):34-60, pp. 41-42&lt;/ref&gt;

Vygotsky's self-criticism was complemented by external criticism for a number of issues, including the separation between the "higher" and the "lower" psychological functions, impracticality and inapplicability of his theory in social practices (such as industry or education) during the time of rapid social change, and vulgar Marxist interpretation of human psychological processes. Critics also pointed to his overemphasis on the role of language and, on the other hand, the ignorance of the emotional factors in human development. Major figures in Soviet psychology such as [[Sergei Rubinstein]] criticized Vygotsky's notion of mediation and its development in the works of students. Following criticism and in response to generous offer from the highest officials in Soviet Ukraine, a major group of Vygotsky's associates, the members of the [[Vygotsky Circle]], including [[Alexander Luria|Luria]], [[Mark Lebedinsky]], and [[Aleksei N. Leontiev|Leontiev]], moved from Moscow to Ukraine to establish the [[Kharkov School of Psychology|Kharkov school of psychology]]. In the second half of the 1930s, Vygotsky was criticized again for his involvement in the cross-disciplinary study of the child known as [[paedology]] and uncritical borrowings from contemporary "bourgeois" science. Considerable critique came from the alleged Vygotsky's followers, such as Leontiev and members of his research group in Kharkov. Much of this early criticism was later discarded by these Vygotskian scholars as well.

==="Holistic" period (1932–1934)===

The period of major revision of Vygotsky's theory and its transition from mechanist orientation of his 1920s to integrative holistic science of the 1930s. During this period Vygotsky was under particularly strong influence of holistic theories of German-American group of proponents of [[Gestalt psychology]], most notably, the peripheral participants of the Gestalt movement [[Kurt Goldstein]] and [[Kurt Lewin]]. However, Vygotsky's work of this period remained largely fragmentary and unfinished and, therefore, unpublished.

====Zone of proximal development====
"[[Zone of proximal development]]" (ZPD) is Vygotsky's term for the range of tasks that a child is in the process of learning to complete. In the original Vygotsky's writings this phrase is used in three different meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Kozulin, A. (2014). Dynamic assessment in search of its identity in Yasnitsky, A., van der Veer, R., &amp; Ferrari, M. (Eds.). (2014). The Cambridge Handbook of Cultural-Historical Psychology. Cambridge University Press (pp. 126-147)&lt;/ref&gt; Vygotsky viewed the ZPD as a better way to explain the relation between children’s learning and cognitive development. Prior to the ZPD, the relation between learning and development could be boiled down to the following three major positions: 1) Development always precedes learning (e.g., [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]]): children first need to meet a particular maturation level before learning can occur; 2) Learning and development cannot be separated, but instead occur simultaneously (e.g., [[behaviorism]]): essentially, learning is development; and 3) learning and development are separate, but interactive processes (e.g., [[gestaltism]]): one process always prepares the other process, and vice versa. Vygotsky rejected these three major theories because he believed that learning should always precede development in the ZPD. According to Vygotsky, through the assistance of a more capable person, a child is able to learn skills or aspects of a skill that go beyond the child’s actual developmental or maturational level. The lower limit of ZPD is the level of skill reached by the child working independently (also referred to as the child's developmental level). The upper limit is the level of potential skill that the child is able to reach with the assistance of a more capable instructor. In this sense, the ZPD provides a prospective view of cognitive development, as opposed to a retrospective view that characterizes development in terms of a child’s independent capabilities.

====''Thinking and speech''====
Perhaps Vygotsky's most important contribution concerns the inter-relationship of language development and thought. This problem was explored in Vygotsky's book, ''Thinking and speech'', entitled in Russian, ''Myshlenie i rech'', that was published in 1934. In fact, this book was a mere collection of essays and scholarly papers that Vygotsky wrote during different periods of his thought development and included writings of his "instrumental" and "holistic" periods. Vygotsky never saw the book published: it was published posthumously, edited by his closest associates (Kolbanovskii, Zankov, and Shif) not sooner than December, 1934, i.e., half a year after his death. First English translation was published in 1962 (with several later revised editions) heavily abbreviated and under an alternative and incorrect translation of the title ''Thought and Language'' for the Russian title ''Mysl' i iazyk''. The book establishes the explicit and profound connection between speech (both silent inner speech and oral language), and the development of mental concepts and cognitive awareness. Vygotsky described inner speech as being qualitatively different from verbal external speech. Although Vygotsky believed inner speech developed from external speech via a gradual process of "internalization" (i.e., transition from the external to the internal), with younger children only really able to "think out loud", he claimed that in its mature form, inner speech would not resemble spoken language as we know it (in particular, being greatly compressed). Hence, thought itself developing socially.

===Death (1934) and posthumous fame===
Vygotsky died of [[tuberculosis]] on June 11, 1934, at the age of 37, in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]]. One of Vygotsky's last private notebook entries gives a proverbial, yet very pessimistic self-assessment of his contribution to psychological theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the final thing I have done in psychology – and I will like [[Moses]] die at the summit, having glimpsed the promised land but without setting foot on it. Farewell, dear creations. The rest is silence.&lt;ref name="revBook"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Immediately after his death, Vygotsky was proclaimed one of the leading psychologists in the Soviet Union, although his stellar reputation was somewhat undermined by the decree of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of 1936 that denounced the mass movement, discipline, and related social practice of the so-called [[Pedology (children study)|pedology]]. Yet, even despite some criticisms and censorship of his works—most notably, in the post-Stalin era in the Soviet Union of 1960s-1980s by his Russian alleged and self-proclaimed best students and followers—Vygotsky always remained among the most quoted scholars in the field and has become a [[Cult following|cult figure]] for a number of contemporary intellectuals and practitioners in Russia and the international psychological and educational community alike.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, J. &amp; Yasnitsky, A.

==Influence worldwide==

===Eastern Europe===
In the [[Soviet Union]], the work of the group of Vygotsky's students known as the [[Vygotsky Circle]] was vital for preserving and, in many respects, distorting the scientific legacy of Lev Vygotsky.&lt;ref name="Kozulin 1986 264–274"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kozulin|first=A.|title=The concept of activity in Soviet psychology: Vygotsky, his disciples and critics|journal=American Psychologist|year=1986|volume=41|issue=3|pages=264–274|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.41.3.264}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the group subsequently laid a foundation for Vygotskian psychology's systematic development in such diverse fields as the psychology of memory ([[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]]), perception, sensation, and movement ([[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]], [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]], [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]]), personality (Lidiya Bozhovich, [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]], [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]]), will and volition ([[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]], [[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]], [[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]], L. Bozhovich, [[Vladimir Asnin|Asnin]]), psychology of play (G. D. Lukov, Daniil El'konin) and psychology of learning ([[Pyotr Zinchenko|P. Zinchenko]], L. Bozhovich, D. El'konin), as well as the theory of step-by-step formation of mental actions (Pyotr Gal'perin), general psychological [[activity theory]] ([[Alexei Nikolaevich Leont'ev|A. N. Leont'ev]]) and psychology of action ([[Alexander Zaporozhets|Zaporozhets]]).&lt;ref name="Kozulin 1986 264–274"/&gt; Andrey Puzyrey elaborated the ideas of Vygotsky in respect of psychotherapy and even in the broader context of deliberate [[psychological intervention]] (psychotechnique), in general.&lt;ref name=Puzyrey&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vassilieva|first=J.|title=Russian psychology at the turn of the 21st century and post-Soviet reforms in the humanities disciplines|journal=History of Psychology|year=2010|volume=13|issue=2|pages=138–159|doi=10.1037/a0019270}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Laszlo Garai]] &lt;ref&gt;:Interview with Laszlo Garai on the Activity Theory of Alexis Leontiev and his own Theory of Social Identity as referred to the meta-theory of Lev Vygotsky.

===North America===
In North America, Vygotsky's work was known from the end of the 1920s through a series of publications in English, but it did not have a major impact on research in general. In 1962 a translation of his posthumous 1934 book, ''Thinking and Speech'', published with the title,''Thought and Language'', did not seem to change the situation considerably. It was only after an eclectic compilation of partly rephrased and partly translated works of Vygotsky and his collaborators, published in 1978 under Vygotsky's name as ''Mind in Society'', that the Vygotsky boom started in the West: originally, in North America, and later, following the North American example, spread to other regions of the world. This version of Vygotskian science is typically associated with the names of its chief proponents Michael Cole, [[James Wertsch]], their associates and followers, and is relatively well-known under the names of "[[cultural-historical activity theory]]" (aka CHAT) or—yet more distant from Vygotsky's legacy--"[[activity theory]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roth|first=W.M.|author2=Lee, J.Y. |title="Vygotsky's Neglected Legacy": Cultural Historical Activity Theory|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=June 2007|volume=77|issue=2|doi=10.3102/0034654306298273|pages=186–232|url=http://lchc.ucsd.edu/MCA/Mail/xmcamail.2007_06.dir/att-0021/Wolff-Michael_Roth_Vygotsky.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="toomela1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for cultural-historical psychology | url = | journal = Culture &amp; Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 353–364 | doi=10.1177/1354067x0063005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref  name="toomela2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Toomela | first1 = A | year = 2008 | title = Activity theory is a dead end for methodological thinking in cultural psychology too | url = | journal = Culture &amp; Psychology | volume = 14 | issue = 3| pages = 289–303 | doi=10.1177/1354067x08088558}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Instructional scaffolding|Scaffolding]], a concept introduced by Wood, [[Jerome Bruner|Bruner]], and Ross in 1976, is somewhat related to the idea of ZPD, although Vygotsky never used the term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wood | first1 = D.

==Criticisms of North American "Vygotskian" and original Vygotsky's legacy==
A critique of the North American interpretation of Vygotsky's ideas and, somewhat later, its global spread and dissemination appeared in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Valsiner, J. (1988). Developmental psychology in the Soviet Union. Brighton, Sussex: Harvester Press, p. 117: Present-day psychologists’ interest in Vygotsky’s thinking is indeed paradoxical. On the one hand, his writings seem increasingly popular among developmental psychologists in Europe and North America. On the other hand, however, careful analyses and thorough understanding of the background of Vygotsky’s ideas is rare... Vygotsky seems to be increasingly well known in international psychology, while remaining little understood. The roots of his thinking in international philosophical and psychological discourse remain largely hidden. His ideas have rarely been developed further, along either theoretical or empirical lines.&lt;/ref&gt; The early 1980s criticism of Russian and Western "Vygotskian" scholars &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Simon | first1 = J | year = 1987 | title = Vygotsky and the Vygotskians | url = | journal = American Journal of Education | volume = 95 | issue = 4| pages = 609–613 }}&lt;/ref&gt; continued throughout the 1990s. Thus, different authors emphasized the biased and fragmented interpretations of Vygotsky by representatives of what was termed "neo-Vygotskian fashions in contemporary psychology"&lt;ref&gt;Van der Veer, R., and J. Valsiner. 1991. Understanding Vygotsky: A quest for synthesis. Oxford: Blackwell, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; or "selective traditions" in Vygotskian scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Cazden, C. B. 1996. Selective traditions: Readings of Vygotsky in writing pedagogy. In Child discourse and social learning: An interdisciplinary perspective, edited by D. Hicks, 165-186. New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Characteristically, the most fashionable "Vygotskian" phraseology in wide circulation in Western scholarly and educational discourse—such as the so-called "[[zone of proximal development]]"—in the critical literature of this period were referred to as "one of the most used and least understood constructs to appear in contemporary educational literature",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Palincsar | first1 = A. S. | year = 1998 | title = Keeping the metaphor of scaffolding fresh - a response to C. Addison Stone's "The metaphor of scaffolding: Its utility for the field of learning disabilities | url = | journal = Journal of Learning Disabilities | volume = 31 | pages = 370–373| doi = 10.1177/002221949803100406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the construct that was "used as little more than a fashionable alternative to Piagetian terminology or the concept of IQ for describing individual differences in attainment or potential".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mercer | first1 = N. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = E. | year = 1992 | title = How do teachers help children to learn? An anlysis of teacher's interventions in compter-based activities | url = | journal = Learning and instruction | volume = 2 | issue = 339–355| page = 342 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other authors also suggest clearly distinguishing between Vygotsky's original notion of "zona blizhaishego razvitiia" (''ZBR'') and its later Western superficial interpretations known under the umbrella term, "zone of proximal development" (''ZPD'').&lt;ref&gt;Valsiner, J., &amp; Van der Veer, R. (1993). The encoding of distance: The concept of the zone of proximal development and its interpretations. In R. R. Cocking &amp; K. A. Renninger (Eds.), The development and meaning of psychological distance (pp. 35-62). Hillsdale, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valsiner, J., &amp; van der Veer, R. (2014). Encountering the border: Vygotsky’s zona blizaishego razvitya and its implications for theory of development. In A. Yasnitsky, R. van der Veer, &amp; M. Ferrari (Eds.), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Cultural-Historical Psychology''. (pp. 148-174). Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism continued and reached a peak in the 2000s. Most often these critiques address numerous distortions of Vygotsky's ideas, mere "declarations of faith",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Valsiner, J., and R. Van der Veer (2000). The social mind: Construction of the idea. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p.4: It is often an open question as to what functions such declarations can have in science. From a position of in-depth analysis, such statements seem merely to be stating the obvious (compared with the statements like the rain is wet or the rich are affluent). And yet, such general claims about the sociality of the human psyche are made with remarkable vigour and repetitiveness&lt;/ref&gt; "versions of Vygotsky",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gillen | first1 = J | year = 2000 | title = Versions of Vygotsky | url = | journal = British Journal of Educational Studies | volume = 48 | issue = 2| pages = 183–98 | doi=10.1111/1467-8527.t01-1-00141}}&lt;/ref&gt; the "concepts and inferences curiously attributed to Lev Vygotsky",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gredler | first1 = M.

Critical analysis of Vygotsky's ideas revealed that the alleged "Vygotsky's theory of play" never existed as such: instead, it was proposed that "Vygotsky's brief writings about play do not constitute a theory according to scientific definitions of psychological theory, and would be better acknowledged merely as part of the historical evolution of ideas about children's play. Of greater significance is that the theoretical relevance of Vygotsky's opinion about play can seriously be called into question upon the basis of current research in the area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=E.

Thus the support claimed from Vygotsky in accounts of second language acquisition is misplaced, first because of those difficulties and, second, because many who claim support from Vygotsky, do not need or even use his theory but instead focus their attention on his empirical observations and assume incorrectly that if their own empirical observations match Vygotsky's, then Vygotsky's theory can be accepted".&lt;ref name="newman"&gt;Newman, S.

==Revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies==
The revisionist movement in Vygotsky Studies was termed a "revisionist revolution"&lt;ref name="revBook"/&gt; to describe a relatively recent trend that emerged in the 1990s. This trend is typically associated with growing dissatisfaction with the quality and scholarly integrity of available texts of Vygotsky and members of [[Vygotsky Circle]], including their English translations made from largely mistaken, distorted, and even in a few instances falsified Soviet editions,&lt;ref&gt;Veer, R., van der (1997).

The revisionist strand is solidly grounded in a series of studies in Vygotsky's archives that uncovered previously unknown and unpublished Vygotsky materials.&lt;ref name="Zavershneva, E 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zavershneva, E. 2007.

Thus, some studies of the revisionist strand show that certain phrases, terms, and expressions typically associated with Vygotskian legacy as its core notions and concepts—such as "cultural-historical psychology", "cultural-historical theory", "cultural-historical school", "higher psychical/mental functions", "internalization", "zone of proximal development", etc., -- in fact, either occupy not more than just a few dozen pages within the six-volume collection of Vygotsky’s works,&lt;ref&gt;Tudge, J. 1999.

==''Complete Works of L. S. Vygotsky''==
Scholars associated with the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] movement in Vygotsky Studies propose returning to Vygotsky's original uncensored works, critically revising the available discourse, and republishing them in both Russian and translation with a rigorous scholarly commentary.&lt;ref name="html"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Veer, R., van der (2010).

Website for International Cultural Historical Studies (http://www.ichs.udk.-berlin.de{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }})&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, an essential part of this revisionist strand is the ongoing work on "''PsyAnima'' Complete Vygotsky" project&lt;ref&gt;[http://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/ psyanimajournal]: [http://psyanimajournal.livejournal.com/3526.html PsyAnima Полное собрание сочинений Выготского / PsyAnima Complete Vygotsky]&lt;/ref&gt; that for the first time ever exposes full collections of Vygotsky's texts, uncensored and cleared from numerous mistakes, omissions, insertions, and blatant distortions and falsifications of the author's text made in Soviet editions and uncritically transferred in virtually all foreign translated editions of Vygotsky's works. This project is carried out by an international team of volunteers—researchers, archival workers, and library staff—from Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, and Switzerland, who joined their efforts and put together a collection of L. S. Vygotsky’s texts. This publication work is supported by a stream of critical scholarly studies and publications on textology, history, theory and methodology of Vygotskian research that cumulatively contributes to the first ever edition of ''The Complete Works of L.S.

'''Lutheran art''' consists of all [[religious art]] produced for Lutherans and the [[Lutheran Church]]es. This includes sculpture, painting, and architecture. Artwork in the Lutheran Churches arose as a distinct marker of the faith during the [[Reformation]] era and attempted to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the teachings of Lutheran theology.

== Reformation era ==
[[File:Lucas Cranach - Verdammnis und Erlösung.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]'', by Lutheran painter [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]] (1536).]]
[[Martin Luther]], the founder of the [[Lutheran Church]]es, encouraged the display of some religious imagery in churches, seeing the Evangelical Lutheran Church as a continuation of the "ancient, apostolic church".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"/&gt; He defended the use of "importance of images as tools for instruction and aids to devotion",&lt;ref name="Naaeke2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Naaeke|first=Anthony Y.|title=Kaleidoscope Catechesis: Missionary Catechesis in Africa, Particularly in the Diocese of Wa in Ghana| year=2006|publisher=Peter Lang|language=Engish|isbn=9780820486857|page=114|quote=Although some reformers, such as John Calvin and Ulrich Zwingli, rejected all images, Martin Luther defended the importance of images as tools for instruction and aids to devotion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating that "If it is not a sin but good to have the image of Christ in my heart, why should it be a sin to have it in my eyes?"&lt;ref name="Noble2009"&gt;Noble, 67-69&lt;/ref&gt; 

His attitude towards images became more positive after his dispute with [[Andreas Karlstadt]] began in 1521. Luther had left Karlstadt in effective charge of his church in [[Wittenberg]] when he went into retreat in the [[Wartburg]], but Karlstadt introduced a considerably more [[Radical Reformation]] than Luther approved, which included the removal of all religious images from churches.  As with the later Calvinist programmes of complete destruction of images, this aroused more popular opposition than other aspects of the radical innovations, and Luther's support for images was in part an attempt to distinguish his positions from more radical ones, as well as an attempt to avoid stirring up opposition over an issue he did not see as central. 

Luther also understood the value of [[Propaganda_during_the_Reformation#Protestant_propaganda|crude polemical woodcuts]] in the propaganda battle, and commissioned some himself.  He also appears to have worked personally with artists to develop didactic compositions that were used as book frontispieces, including for the [[Luther Bible]] which had an elaborate [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] in all early editions, prints, and relatively small versions in oils. ''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]'' (1529) by the Lutheran painter [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] is the earliest painting of this type,&lt;ref&gt;Noble, 1, 12-14 on the extent of Cranach's "Lutheranism" in the early years&lt;/ref&gt; painted in different versions, and turned into a [[woodcut]].  Several share a similar composition, divided vertically into two by a tree, also found in many polemical prints; typically there is a good side and a bad side. Lutheran [[Catechism#Lutheran_catechisms|catechism]]s, an important means of disseminating Lutheran teachings among the congregations, were often illustrated with woodcuts, as were [[prayerbook]]s and other religious literature.&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 33-38&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning of Lutheranism's spread to German territories in the 1520s and 1530s, local ordinances set out a variety of treatments of existing imagery in churches.  Where, as was sometimes the case, nothing was said, it is presumed that it was intended that many images could be retained. In the Lutheran churches of Nuremberg, for example, "side altars, sacrament houses and saints' shrines provided (and continue to provide) the visual backdrop for evangelical worship".&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 46&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, depending on the views of the ruler or council, all images were to be removed, as in [[Hesse]] in 1526, although Martin Luther objected to this decision, apparently ineffectively.&lt;ref name="Heal2017"&gt;Heal (2017), 43-45. "In Hesse, for example, the Homberg Synod that met in 1526 at the behest of Landgrave Phillip made no concessions with regard to images: all should be removed, whatever the status and subject matter. Although Luther objected to the conclusions reached by this synod, Phillip again decreed the removal of images in 1527."&lt;/ref&gt; Some ordinances specified that only "images near and before which particular worship and idolatry and special honour with candles and lights have been practiced" should be removed but also emphasized that "we may not be iconoclasts", in the words of a [[Hamburg]] ordinance of 1529.&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 43-44&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Brandenburg]], an injunction was pronounced to retain 'altars...images and paintings' and in [[Württemberg]], images that were neglected or damaged were restored or replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 52&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Augsburg Interim]] and [[Leipzig Interim]] settled the issue, both pronouncing that sacred art would be preserved in the Lutheran Churches, though they would not be the focal point of worship, thus making the Lutheran position a ''via media'' between what Lutheran theologians perceived as 'Roman Catholic idolatry' and 'Calvinist iconoclasm'.&lt;ref&gt;Heal (2017), 51&lt;/ref&gt;

A few Lutheran [[altarpiece]]s, including those of the [[Last Supper]], were commissioned under the purview of Martin Luther. The ''Schneeberg Altarpiece'' was placed at the [[high altar]] of [[St. Wolfgang im Salzkammergut]] and as Lutheran sacred imagery, reflected "the devotional forms of fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century northern art".&lt;ref name="Noble2009"/&gt; The ''Schneeberg Altarpiece'' (1539), along with the ''Wittenberg Altarpiece'' (1547) and the ''Weimar Altarpiece'' (1555), were Christocentric in their iconography and "these altarpieces reinforced the key teachings of the new church and helped consolidate a sense of confessional identity."&lt;ref name="Cameron2016"/&gt; In eastern Germany, Lutheran patrons erected some thirty new altarpieces.&lt;ref name="KatznelsonRubin2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katznelson|first1=Ira|last2=Rubin|first2=Miri|title=Religious Conversion: History, Experience and Meaning|date=8 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781317067009|page=109-112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most pre-Reformation altarpieces were preserved within Lutheran churches as the "altar was still believed to be a particularly holy place, and should be adorned accordingly."&lt;ref name="2016KatznelsonRubin"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Katznelson|first1=Ira|last2=Rubin|first2=Miri|title=Religious Conversion: History, Experience and Meaning|date=2016 |publisher=Routledge|language=English|isbn=9781317067009|page=109-112|quote=In most Lutheran territories, however, altars and altarpieces were not only preserved, but they also continued to be used and were even commissioned anew. Lutheran commitment to the doctrine of Christ's real presence undoubtedly provides the key to understanding this visual conservatism. The altar was still believed to be a particularly holy place, and should be adorned accordingly.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lutheran sacred art gained a new function in addition to exciting one's mind to thoughts of the Divine by also serving a didactic purpose.&lt;ref name="Noble2009"/&gt; Cranach's ''[[Law and Gospel (Cranach)|Law and Gospel]]'', for example, "enshrines the specific authority of the word of the Bible by including biblical passages as prominent parts of the composition."&lt;ref name="Cameron2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cameron|first=Euan|title=The New Cambridge History of the Bible: Volume 3, From 1450 to 1750 |date=1 September 2016|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English|isbn=9781316351741|page=1198-1339}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheranism was responsible for "an explosion of creativity in the graphic arts" with works such as ''Passional Christi und Antichristi'' by [[Philipp Melanchthon]], being described as "richly illustrated".&lt;ref name="Cameron2016"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/luthers-anti-papist-pamphlet-passional-christi-und-antichristi-1521|title=Luther's anti-papist pamphlet, Passional Christi und Antichristi, 1521  - The British Library|publisher=[[British Library]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This much is evident from the background of an epitaph painted in 1615 by Martin Schulz, destined for the Nikolaikirche in Berlin (see Figure 5.5.).}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ornate church interiors in Lutheran churches reflected [[Eucharist in Lutheranism|Lutheran Eucharistic theology]], which taught the [[real presence of Christ in the Eucharist]] as a [[sacramental union]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"&gt;Lamport, 138. "Lutherans continued to worship in pre-Reformation churches, generally with few alterations to the interior. It has even been suggested that in Germany to this day one finds more ancient Marian altarpieces in Lutheran than in Catholic churches. Thus in Germany and in Scandinavia many pieces of medieval art and architecture survived. [[Joseph Leo Koerner]] has noted that Lutherans, seeing themselves in the tradition of the ancient, apostolic church, sought to defend as well as reform the use of images. "An empty, white-washed church proclaimed a wholly spiritualized cult, at odds with Luther's doctrine of Christ's real presence in the sacraments" (Koerner 2004, 58). In fact, in the 16th century some of the strongest opposition to destruction of images came not from Catholics but from Lutherans against Calvinists: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return" (Koerner 2004, 58). Works of art continued to be displayed in Lutheran churches, often including an imposing large crucifix in the sanctuary, a clear reference to Luther's ''theologia crucis''. ... In contrast, Reformed (Calvinist) churches are strikingly different. Usually unadorned and somewhat lacking in aesthetic appeal, pictures, sculptures, and ornate altar-pieces are largely absent; there are few or no candles; and crucifixes or crosses are also mostly absent.&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheran churches, as well as homes, displayed a prominent [[crucifix]] as it highlighted their high view of the [[Theology of the Cross]].&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MarquardtJordan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marquardt|first1=Janet T.|last2=Jordan|first2=Alyce A.|title=Medieval Art and Architecture after the Middle Ages |date=14 January 2009|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|language=English|isbn=9781443803984|page=71|quote=In fact, Lutherans often justified their continued use of medieval crucifixes with the same arguments employed since the Middle Ages, as is evident from the example of the altar of the Holy Cross in the Cistercian church of Doberan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2018Heal"/&gt; It became a popular devotional image for Lutherans, who "prayed, meditated, and even wept before them."&lt;ref name="2018Heal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English |quote=Images also came to play a key part in the new forms of Lutheran piety promulgated during the later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries by figures such as Johann Arndt.

During the [[Beeldenstorm]] or Iconoclastic Fury, bands often categorized as Calvinists violently removed sacred art from churches.&lt;ref&gt;Arnade, Peter J., ''Beggars, Iconoclasts, and Civic Patriots: the Political Culture of the Dutch Revolt'', pp. 97-142, Cornell University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-8014-7496-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8014-7496-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stark2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stark|first=Rodney|title=The Victory of Reason: How Christianity Led to Freedom, Capitalism, and Western Success| date=18 December 2007|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|language=English |isbn=9781588365002|page=176|quote=The Beeldenstorm, or Iconoclastic Fury, involved roving bands of radical Calvinists who were utterly opposed to all religious images and decorations in churches and who acted on their beliefs by storming into Catholic churches and destroying all artwork and finery.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Byfield2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Byfield|first=Ted|title=A Century of Giants, A.D. 1500 to 1600: In an Age of Spiritual Genius, Western Christendom Shatters |year=2002|publisher=Christian History Project|language=English|isbn=9780968987391|page=297|quote=Devoutly Catholic but opposed to Inquisition tactics, they backed William of Orange in subduing the Calvinist uprising of the Dutch beeldenstorm on behalf of regent Margaret of Parma, and had come willingly to the council at her invitation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lutherans generally opposed the iconoclasm, one saying: "You black Calvinist, you give permission to smash our pictures and hack our crosses; we are going to smash you and your Calvinist priests in return".&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"/&gt; As such, Calvinist iconoclasm, "provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs" in Germany.&lt;ref name="Marshall2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=Peter|title=The Reformation| date=22 October 2009|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|isbn=9780191578885|page=114|quote=Iconoclastic incidents during the Calvinist 'Second Reformation' in Germany provoked reactive riots by Lutheran mobs, while Protestant image-breaking in the Baltic region deeply antagonized the neighbouring Eastern Orthodox, a group with whom reformers might have hoped to make common cause.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lutheran theologian and priest [[Johann Arndt]] was forced to flee [[Anhalt]] when it became Calvinist in the 1580s, due to his defense of Christian sacred art.&lt;ref name="KatznelsonRubin2016"/&gt; He wrote a treatise ''Ikonographia'', in which he criticized the Reformed faith for consecrating the Eucharistic elements on wooden tables rather than on stone altars.&lt;ref name="KatznelsonRubin2016"/&gt; As Calvinism, along with its associated [[aniconism]] spread, "Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images."&lt;ref name="Heal2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Baroque period ==
[[File:Dresden Martin Luther statue in front of Frauenkirche 04.JPG|thumb|Bronze statue of Martin Luther, in front of the [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Lutheran Church of Our Lady]], by Adolf von Donndorf. (1885)]]
Artists who designed Lutheran Baroque art not only took their inspiration from Martin Luther, but from popular Lutheran piety in the latter part of the 16th and 17th centuries.&lt;ref name="Heal2018"/&gt; The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden:&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt;
{{quotation|From the pulpit beside the entrance to the choir area the pure Word of God was preached against a truly magnificent visual backdrop. With its imposing high altar, showing in sculpted relief the emotive scene of Christ in prayer on the Mount of Olives, its splendid organ and its cupola with paintings of the evangelists and virtues by Giovanni Battista Grone, the interior of the Frauenkirche embraces illusion, even illusion dependent on the techniques of the Italian baroque. The Frauenkirche rivalled contemporary Catholic churches in its beauty and splendour and was, in fact, compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter’s in Rome.&lt;ref name="Heal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=‘Better Papist than Calvinist’: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
In the second half of the 17th century, high baroque art continued to spread through Saxony, under the rule of [[John George II, Elector of Saxony|Johann Georg II]].&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt; Pieces like the altar of Johanneskirche resembled the ''[[Descent from the Cross]]'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt;

More typically, [[Daniel Hisgen]] (1733-1812) was a German painter of the [[rococo]] period who worked as a painter of Lutheran churches in [[Upper Hesse]], specializing on cycles of paintings decorating the front of the gallery parapet in churches with an upper gallery. His discreet cycles demonstrate the modest prominence expected of Lutheran art in German churches of his day, taking a middle route between the large and prominent images in Catholic churches, and the complete absence of images in Calvinist ones.

== 19th century ==
[[File:Maria and martha church bautzen 102.JPG|thumb|Sculpture around the entrance to a [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] Lutheran church in [[Bautzen]], [[Saxony]].]]
In the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark]], several Lutheran altarpieces were designed and housed within parish churches.&lt;ref name="ELCD2017"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutheranchurch.dk/nc/liturgy-and-worship/symbols-and-art/the-altarpiece/?print=1|title=The Altarpiece: A Long Tradition|year=2017|publisher=[[Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these were designed by artists such as [[Carl Bloch]] and [[Joakim Skovgaard]].&lt;ref name="ELCD2017"/&gt;

== Present day ==
With respect to artwork adorning Lutheran churches in the modern era:
{{quotation|Lutheran places of worship contain images and sculptures not only of Christ but also of biblical and occasionally of other saints as well as prominent decorated pulpits due to the importance of preaching, stained glass, ornate furniture, magnificent examples of traditional and modern architecture, carved or otherwise embellished altar pieces, and liberal use of candles on the altar and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"/&gt;}}

Within the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark, religious artists including [[Arne Haugen Sørensen]], [[Peter Brandes]], [[Hein Heinsen]] and [[Maja Lisa Engelhardt]] continue to design Lutheran art today.&lt;ref name="ELCD2017"/&gt; It has been claimed that more pre-Reformation [[Lutheran Marian theology|Marian]] altarpieces survive in German Lutheran churches than Catholic ones,&lt;ref name="Lamport2017-138"/&gt; where many were replaced in the Baroque period.

The '''Max Planck Institute for Plant Breeding Research''' was founded in [[Müncheberg]], Germany in 1928 as part of the [[Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft]]. The founding director, [[Erwin Baur]], initiated breeding programmes with fruits and berries, and basic research on ''[[Antirrhinum majus]]'' and the domestication of [[lupin]]s. After the Second World War, the institute moved west to [[Voldagsen]], and was relocated to new buildings on the present site in [[Cologne]] in 1955. 

·The modern era of the Institute began in 1978 with the appointment of [[Jeff Schell]] and the development of plant transformation technologies and plant [[molecular genetics]]. The focus on molecular genetics was extended in 1980 with the appointment of Heinz Saedler. The appointment in 1983 of Klaus Hahlbrock broadened the expertise of the Institute in the area of plant biochemistry, and the arrival of Francesco Salamini in 1985 added a focus on crop genetics. During the period 1978-1990, the Institute was greatly expanded and new buildings were constructed for the departments led by Schell, Hahlbrock and Salamini, in addition to a new lecture hall and the [[Max Delbrück]] Laboratory building that housed independent research groups over a period of 10 years.

A new generation of directors was appointed from 2000 with the approaching retirements of Klaus Hahlbrock and Jeff Schell. [[Paul Schulze-Lefert]] and [[George Coupland]] were appointed in 2000 and 2001, respectively, and [[Maarten Koornneef]] arrived three years later upon the retirement of Francesco Salamini. The new scientific departments brought a strong focus on utilising model species to understand the regulatory principles and molecular mechanisms underlying selected traits. The longer-term aim is to translate these discoveries to breeding programmes through the development of rational breeding concepts. The arrival of a new generation of Directors also required modernisation of the infrastructure. So far, this has involved complete refurbishment of the building that houses the Plant Developmental Biology laboratory (2004), construction of a new guesthouse and library (2005), planning of new buildings for the administration and technical workshops (2009), and a new laboratory building completed in May 2012. The new laboratory building includes a section that links the three scientific departments, offices and the Bioinformatics Research Group.

{{Asof|May 2015}}, the institute had four scientific departments: Department of Plant Developmental Biology (George Coupland), Department of Plant Breeding and Genetics (Maarten Koornneef), Department of Plant Microbe Interactions (Paul Schulze-Lefert), and Department of Comparative Development and Genetics ([[Miltos Tsiantis]]), and a number of independent research groups.

== Graduate program ==
Beginning in 1999 the [[Max Planck Society]] initiated the implementation of International Max Planck Research Schools (IMPRS) as a new way to cooperate with partner universities in Germany. The intention of this ambitious plan is twofold. On the one hand, the [[Max Planck Society]] tries to intensify the collaboration with university affiliated research groups and faculty at home. On the other hand, due to the great demand of junior scientists, one was trying to attract qualified students from Germany and abroad to help train a new generation of scientists. It seemed reasonable to combine scientific leadership and technical expertise on a local scale by jointly offering this new way to train promising scientists from around the world. The Ph.D. program provides a true interdisciplinary approach for highly motivated students to receive a Ph.D. degree and to participate in cutting edge research. Major changes and adjustments were necessary to put this idea into reality. First, because of the international character, teaching and practical training had to be offered in English to make the program attractive for foreign students. Second, the training should target a very specific area of research for which the existing faculty is internationally known. Third, the research schools are intended to represent centres of excellence. The IMPRS at the Max Planck Institute of Plant Breeding Research together with the [[University of Cologne]] represent such a centre of excellence in the area of molecular plant science, and was formed in 2001. Currently,{{when|date=October 2014}} this IMPRS has about 40 Ph.D. students, where half come from countries outside of Germany. Admission is entirely linked to scientific merit and achievement.

The '''Newcomen Society''' is an [[International]] [[learned society]] that promotes and celebrates the history of [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. It was founded in [[London]] in 1920 and takes its name from [[Thomas Newcomen]], one of the inventors associated with the early development of the [[steam engine]] and who is widely considered the "father of the Industrial Revolution".

The motto of the Society is the [[Latin]] ''actorum memores simul affectamus agenda'', meaning "mindful of things that have taken place, at the same time we strive after things yet to be done". The choice of a [[griffin]] [[regardant]] for the logo was to symbolise vigilance and looking backward while going forward.

The Newcomen Society is based at the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London. There are regional branches in England: Midlands ([[Birmingham]]), North West ([[Manchester]]), North East ([[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]), Western ([[Bristol]]) and Southern ([[Portsmouth]]), and one in Scotland ([[Glasgow]] and [[Edinburgh]]).

The Society is concerned with all branches of engineering: [[civil engineering|civil]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[Electronic engineering|electronic]], [[structural engineering|structural]], [[aeronautical engineering|aeronautical]], [[marine engineering|marine]], [[chemical engineering|chemical]] and [[manufacturing]] as well as [[biography]] and [[invention]].

It publishes the '''International Journal for the History of Engineering and Technology''' (formerly the Transactions of the Newcomen Society) and '''Newcomen Links''', a quarterly newsletter. An online archive of previous Transactions is also available to members of the Society.

An American branch was established in 1923, but the [[Newcomen Society of the United States]] was entirely separate from its UK counterpart in 2007, when the chairman and trustees announced its closure.

The degree was designed for those seeking academic research and teaching careers as faculty or professors in the study of management at business schools worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ph.D. in Management Degree==

===Business doctoral programs===

A [[PhD]] degree is a [[doctor of philosophy]] which can be obtained in many areas of study, while a '''PhD in management''' is specific to the study of research questions with potential relevance to the business world. Areas of specialization for the PhD in business often include, but are not limited to:

* [[Accounting]]
* Decision sciences ([[decision theory]] and [[decision analysis]])
* [[Economics]]
* [[Entrepreneurship]]
* [[Ethics]] and [[legal studies]]
* [[Finance]]
* [[Health care management]]
* [[People management]] or Human Resource management
* [[Leadership]]
* [[Marketing]]
* [[Organizational behavior]]
* [[Operations management]] / [[Operations research]]
* [[Management information systems]] / [[Information technology management]]
* [[Statistics]]
* [[Strategy]]

A '''PhD in management''' or '''business''' is often required for those interested in pursuing an academic career as a professor at a business school.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB "Becoming a Business Professor" article {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Business schools often require faculty to hold a Ph.D. and to engage in research.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB "Becoming a Business Professor" {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Business school rankings are often heavily influenced by the proportion of faculty with Ph.D. degrees or doctorates.&lt;ref&gt;2009 FT rankings table and criteria list http://rankings.ft.com/exportranking/global-mba-rankings/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Research is fundamental to the integrity of a graduate educational institution.  Through research, professors gain the expertise required to teach advanced courses and to ensure that they remain current in his or her chosen field.

===Brief history===

In the 1950s and 1960s, leading '''business schools''' made a transition from vocational training to scientific research, rooted in social sciences, such as economics, [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[systems engineering]], and [[mathematics]].  Since then, Ph.D. programs in business prepare candidates to conduct scholarly research based on rigorous methods and applied to business.  For example, such research might aim to develop new theory and empirical knowledge about business and management problems by combining methods from economics, psychology and mathematical decision theory.  By combining methods from multiple social sciences, business research has developed its own subfields of research, published in business application oriented journals as well as in social sciences journals.&lt;ref&gt;Ph.D. Project http://www.phdproject.org/downloads/What_is_a_PhD.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business research===

Research with regard to the study of business encompasses a wide range of activities.  There are many research methodologies or "tools" one must learn before being able to conduct research.  A PhD program in business will teach one of these various methods.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/phd/overview/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;INSEAD http://www.insead.edu/phd/program/program_structure.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Columbia http://www4.gsb.columbia.edu/phd/whycolumbia/&lt;/ref&gt;
http://www5.google.columbia.phd/wikipedia/&lt;/net&gt;

===Research methodologies===

Common research methodologies used in studying business are: Modeling, [[Econometrics]], [[Experiment]]s, descriptive and Field Studies.

==Program structure==

Typically, the PhD in management takes 4–5 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB article about a PhD in Business and Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The structure is usually 2 years of intensive coursework (core courses and seminars) followed by a comprehensive examination.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dissertation phase is typically 2–3 years.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"/&gt;

==Careers==

Becoming a professor of business means investing years of study before obtaining the desired degree, but academia offers many benefits, including: attractive salaries, the combination of varied activities in one career, intellectual stimulation as well as professional autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;PhD Project {{cite web |url=http://www.phdproject.org/faqs.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219110256/http://www.phdproject.org/faqs.html |archivedate=2014-12-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following through with a PhD degree can be challenging not only because of the academic rigour but also due to the pressure and stress that comes from conducting research and defending a dissertation.  Moreover, once a person obtains a PhD, there is no guarantee that even with an offer from a business school, that the PhD student will go on to publish his or her research in a top journal, will be able to teach effectively, or will receive a tenured faculty position.

Still, for those who have the motivation, drive and stamina to be successful in this field, there are many benefits.  The life of a business professor is markedly different from a corporate career. An academic has more time to explore his or her own interests, pursues research, and rarely has a 'nine to five' type of career. Being a professor is much like being an entrepreneur (bad link – ).&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"&gt;http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/SYOA/page2.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Success is based on the individual, and faculty are often their own bosses. Beyond being intellectually bright and able to conduct research, professors in business also need to be able to perform in the classroom.  Teaching is a fundamental component of being a professor, though most faculty may only teach around 100 hours per year, the classroom setting can be challenging and often involve debate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/SYOA/page1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Not everyone can be a professor, but for those that have the skills required, it provides an excellent standard of living, with salaries comparable to the corporate world.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;  Consulting, book publishing and speaking engagements can also further add to overall compensation.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;  Academic institutions are often less vulnerable than corporations to forces like global economic downturns.  Academia offers much in the way of financial stability.&lt;ref name="hbs.edu"/&gt;

===PhD versus DBA===
The PhD in Business Administration is equivalent to the [[Doctor of Business Administration]] (DBA).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ous/international/usnei/us/doctorate.doc&lt;/ref&gt; Both doctorates are research doctorates representing the highest academic qualification in business in the U.S. education system. As such, both PhD and DBA programs require students to develop original research leading to a dissertation defense.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;FAQs AACSB {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009023410/http://www.aacsb.edu/home-bestbizschools/doctorate/programs/dba |archivedate=2015-10-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, both doctorates enable holders to become faculty members at academic institutions.

In some cases, as in that of Harvard University, the distinction is solely administrative (Harvard Business School is not authorized to issue PhDs; only the Faculty of Arts and Sciences may do so).&lt;ref&gt;Admissions FAQs Harvard http://www.hbs.edu/doctoral/faqs/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, however, the distinction is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The PhD is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the DBA emphasizes applied research leading to the practical application of theoretical knowledge.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Upon completion, graduates of PhD programs generally migrate to academia, while those of DBA programs reemerge in industry as executives in leading organizations often teaching part-time in undergraduate and graduate programs.

'''Pop art''' is an [[art movement]] that emerged in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] during the mid- to late-1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/themes/pop-art ''Pop Art: A Brief History'', MoMA Learning]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pop"&gt;Livingstone, M., ''Pop Art: A Continuing History'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The movement presented a challenge to traditions of [[fine art]] by including imagery from [[popular culture|popular]] and [[mass culture]], such as [[advertising]], [[comic books]] and mundane cultural objects. One of its aims is to use images of ''popular'' (as opposed to elitist) culture in art, emphasizing the banal or [[kitsch]]y elements of any culture, most often through the use of [[irony]].&lt;ref name="ages" /&gt; It is also associated with the artists' use of mechanical means of reproduction or rendering techniques. In pop art, material is sometimes visually removed from its known context, isolated, or combined with unrelated material.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ages"&gt;de la Croix, H.; Tansey, R., ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'', New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, Inc., 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the early artists that shaped the pop art movement were [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]] in [[UK|Britain]], and [[Larry Rivers]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Jasper Johns]] among others in the [[United States]]. Pop art is widely interpreted as a reaction to the then-dominant ideas of [[abstract expressionism]], as well as an expansion of those ideas.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; Due to its utilization of [[found objects]] and images, it is similar to [[Dada]]. Pop art and [[minimalism]] are considered to be art movements that precede [[postmodern art]], or are some of the earliest examples of postmodern art themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Harrison| first=Sylvia |title=Pop Art and the Origins of Post-Modernism| publisher=Cambridge University Press| date=2001-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop art often takes imagery that is currently in use in advertising. Product labeling and logos figure prominently in the imagery chosen by pop artists, seen in the labels of ''[[Campbell's Soup Cans]]'', by [[Andy Warhol]]. Even the labeling on the outside of a shipping box containing food items for retail has been used as subject matter in pop art, as demonstrated by [[Andy Warhol|Warhol's]] ''Campbell's Tomato Juice Box,'' 1964 (pictured).

==Origins==
The origins of pop art in North America developed differently from Great Britain.&lt;ref name="ages" /&gt; In the United States, pop art was a response by artists; it marked a return to [[Hard-edge painting|hard-edged]] composition and [[Representation (arts)|representational art]]. They used impersonal, mundane reality, [[irony]], and [[parody]] to "defuse" the personal symbolism and "[[painterly]] looseness" of [[abstract expressionism]].&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt;&lt;ref name="high"&gt;Gopnik, A.; Varnedoe, K., ''High &amp; Low: Modern Art &amp; Popular Culture'', New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., some artwork by [[Larry Rivers]], [[Alex Katz]] and [[Man Ray]] anticipated pop art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/alex-katz-is-cooler-than-ever-34462293/ |title=History, Travel, Arts, Science, People, Places &amp;#124; Smithsonian |website=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, the origins of pop art in [[Post-war|post-War]] Britain, while employing irony and parody, were more academic. Britain focused on the dynamic and paradoxical imagery of American [[popular culture|pop culture]] as powerful, manipulative symbolic devices that were affecting whole patterns of life, while simultaneously improving the prosperity of a society.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; Early pop art in Britain was a matter of ideas fueled by [[American popular culture]] ''when viewed from afar''.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt;  Similarly, pop art was both an extension and a repudiation of [[Dadaism]].&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; While pop art and Dadaism explored some of the same subjects, pop art replaced the destructive, satirical, and anarchic impulses of the Dada movement with a detached affirmation of the artifacts of mass culture.&lt;ref name="iha" /&gt; Among those artists in Europe seen as producing work leading up to pop art are: [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], and [[Kurt Schwitters]].

===Proto-pop===

Although both British and American pop art began during the 1950s, [[Marcel Duchamp]] and others in Europe like [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Man Ray]] predate the movement; in addition there were some earlier American ''proto-pop'' origins which utilized "as found" cultural objects.&lt;ref name="iha"&gt;Piper, David. ''The Illustrated History of Art'', {{ISBN|0-7537-0179-0}}, p486-487.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1920s, American artists [[Patrick Henry Bruce]], [[Gerald Murphy]], [[Charles Demuth]] and [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]] created paintings that contained pop culture imagery (mundane objects culled from American commercial products and advertising design), almost "prefiguring" the pop art movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/artworld/2007/08/06/070806craw_artworld_schjeldahl |title=Modern Love |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2007-08-06 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Craven, ''American Art: History and .'' p.464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom: the Independent Group==
[[File:Hamilton-appealing2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]]'s collage ''[[Just what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?]]'' (1956) is one of the earliest works to be considered "pop art".|alt=A collage of many different styles shows a mostly naked man and woman in a house.]]

The [[Independent Group]] (IG), founded in London in 1952, is regarded as the precursor to the pop art movement.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;Arnason, H., ''History of Modern Art: Painting, Sculpture, Architecture'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc. 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; They were a gathering of young painters, sculptors, architects, writers and critics who were challenging prevailing modernist approaches to culture as well as traditional views of fine art. Their group discussions centered on pop culture implications from elements such as mass advertising, movies, product design, comic strips, science fiction and technology. At the first Independent Group meeting in 1952, co-founding member, artist and sculptor [[Eduardo Paolozzi]] presented a lecture using a series of [[collage]]s titled ''Bunk!'' that he had assembled during his time in Paris between 1947 and 1949.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; This material of "found objects" such as advertising, comic book characters, magazine covers and various mass-produced graphics mostly represented ''American'' popular culture. One of the collages in that presentation was Paolozzi's ''I was a Rich Man's Plaything'' (1947), which includes the first use of the word "pop", appearing in a cloud of smoke emerging from a revolver.&lt;ref name="pop" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/paolozzi-i-was-a-rich-mans-plaything-t01462 |title='I was a Rich Man's Plaything', Sir Eduardo Paolozzi |publisher=Tate |date=2015-12-10 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Paolozzi's seminal presentation in 1952, the IG focused primarily on the imagery of American popular culture, particularly mass advertising.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt;

According to the son of [[John McHale (artist)|John McHale]], the term "pop art" was first coined by his father in 1954 in conversation with [[Frank Cordell]],&lt;ref name="Warholstars.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/articles/johnmchale/johnmchale.html |title=John McHale |website=Warholstars.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other sources credit its origin to British critic [[Lawrence Alloway]].&lt;ref&gt;"Pop art", ''A Dictionary of Twentieth-Century Art'', Ian Chilvers. Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Pop art", ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms'', Michael Clarke, Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; (Both versions agree that the term was used in [[Independent Group]] discussions by mid-1955.)

"Pop art" as a moniker was then used in discussions by IG members in the Second Session of the IG in 1955, and the specific term "pop art" first appeared in published print in the article "But Today We Collect Ads" by IG members [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] in Ark magazine in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Alison and Peter Smithson, "But Today We Collect Ads", reprinted on page 54 in ''Modern Dreams The Rise and Fall of Pop'', published by ICA and MIT, {{ISBN|0-262-73081-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term is often credited to [[United Kingdom|British]] [[art critic]]/[[curator]] [[Lawrence Alloway]] for his 1958 essay titled ''The Arts and the Mass Media'', even though the precise language he uses is "popular mass culture".&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Alloway, "The Arts and the Mass Media," Architectural Design &amp; Construction, February 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; "Furthermore, what I meant by it then is not what it means now. I used the term, and also 'Pop Culture' to refer to the products of the mass media, not to works of art that draw upon popular culture. In any case, sometime between the winter of 1954-55 and 1957 the phrase acquired currency in conversation..."&lt;ref name="Honnef"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=KRtCl1nFSV8C&amp;pg=PA6&amp;dq=%22term+pop+art%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi44ePWpubWAhVEYlAKHe-2AtEQ6AEIOTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=%22term%20pop%20art%22&amp;f=false Klaus Honnef, ''Pop Art'', Taschen, 2004], p. 6, {{ISBN|3822822183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Alloway was one of the leading critics to defend the inclusion of the imagery of mass culture in the fine arts. Alloway clarified these terms in 1966, at which time Pop Art had already transited from art schools and small galleries to a major force in the artworld. But its success had not been in England. Practically simultaneously, and independently, New York City had become the hotbed for Pop Art.&lt;ref name="Honnef" /&gt;

In London, the annual [[Royal Society of British Artists|Royal Society of British Artists (RBA)]] exhibition of young talent in 1960 first showed American pop influences. In January 1961, the most famous RBA-''Young Contemporaries'' of all put [[David Hockney]], the American [[R B Kitaj]], New Zealander [[Billy Apple]], [[Allen Jones (sculptor)|Allen Jones]], [[Derek Boshier]], [[Joe Tilson]], [[Patrick Caulfield]], [[Peter Phillips (artist)|Peter Phillips]] and [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]] on the map; Apple designed the posters and invitations for both the 1961 and 1962 Young Contemporaries exhibitions.&lt;ref name="Barton 2010 11–21"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barton|first=Christina|title=Billy Apple: British and American Works 1960-69|year=2010|publisher=The Mayor Gallery|location=London|isbn=978-0-9558367-3-2|pages=11–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockney, Kitaj and Blake went on to win prizes at the John-Moores-Exhibition in Liverpool in the same year. Apple and Hockney traveled together to New York during the Royal College's 1961 summer break, which is when Apple first made contact with Andy Warhol – both later moved to the United States and Apple became involved with the New York pop art scene.&lt;ref name="Barton 2010 11–21" /&gt;

==United States==
Although pop art began in the early 1950s, in America it was given its greatest impetus during the 1960s. The term "pop art" was officially introduced in December 1962; the occasion was a "Symposium on Pop Art" organized by the [[Museum of Modern Art]].&lt;ref name="SchermanTony"&gt;Scherman, Tony. "When Pop Turned the Art World Upside Down." ''American Heritage'' 52.1 (February 2001), 68.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, American advertising had adopted many elements and inflections of modern art and functioned at a very sophisticated level. Consequently, American artists had to search deeper for dramatic styles that would distance art from the well-designed and clever commercial materials.&lt;ref name="high" /&gt; As the British viewed American popular culture imagery from a somewhat removed perspective, their views were often instilled with romantic, sentimental and humorous overtones. By contrast, American artists, bombarded every day with the diversity of mass-produced imagery, produced work that was generally more bold and aggressive.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt;
[[File:Roy Lichtenstein Drowning Girl.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roy Lichtenstein]], ''[[Drowning Girl]]'', 1963, on display at the [[Museum of Modern Art, New York]].|alt=A woman's crying face is overwhelmed by waves as she thinks, "I don't care! I'd rather sink than call Brad for help!"]]
Two important painters in the establishment of America's pop art vocabulary were [[Jasper Johns]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]].&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; While the paintings of Rauschenberg have relationships to the earlier work of [[Kurt Schwitters]] and other [[Dada]] artists, his concern was for the social issues of the moment. His approach was to create art out of ephemeral materials. By using topical events in the life of everyday America, he gave his work a unique quality.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Irving Sandler|Sandler, Irving H.]] ''The New York School: The Painters and Sculptors of the Fifties,'' New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1978. {{ISBN|0-06-438505-1}} pp. 174–195, ''Rauschenberg and Johns''; pp. 103–111, ''Rivers and the gestural realists''.&lt;/ref&gt; Johns' and Rauschenberg's work of the 1950s is classified as [[Neo-Dada]], and is visually distinct from the prototypical American pop art which exploded in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Rosenblum, "Jasper Johns" ''Art International'' (September 1960): 75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hapgood,  Susan, ''Neo-Dada: Redefining Art, 1958-62''.

[[File:Cheddar Cheese crop from Campbells Soup Cans MOMA.jpg|thumb|The ''Cheddar Cheese'' canvas from [[Andy Warhol]]'s ''Campbell's Soup Cans'', 1962.]]
[[Roy Lichtenstein]] is of equal importance to American pop art. His work, and its use of [[parody]], probably defines the basic premise of pop art better than any other.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; Selecting the old-fashioned comic strip as subject matter, Lichtenstein produces a hard-edged, precise composition that documents while also parodying in a soft manner. Lichtenstein used [[Oil paint|oil]] and [[Magna paint]] in his best known works, such as ''[[Drowning Girl]]'' (1963), which was [[Appropriation (art)|appropriated]] from the lead story in [[DC Comics]]' ''Secret Hearts'' #83. (''Drowning Girl'' is part of the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].)&lt;ref name="rlf-Hendrickson31"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hendrickson|first=Janis|title=Roy Lichtenstein|year=1988|publisher=Benedikt Taschen|location=Cologne, Germany|isbn=3-8228-0281-6|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work features thick outlines, bold colors and [[Ben-Day dots]] to represent certain colors, as if created by photographic reproduction. Lichtenstein said, "[abstract expressionists] put things down on the canvas and responded to what they had done, to the color positions and sizes. My style looks completely different, but the nature of putting down lines pretty much is the same; mine just don't come out looking calligraphic, like Pollock's or Kline's."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop art merges popular and mass culture with fine art while injecting humor, irony, and recognizable imagery/content into the mix.

The paintings of Lichtenstein, like those of Andy Warhol, [[Tom Wesselmann]] and others, share a direct attachment to the commonplace image of American popular culture, but also treat the subject in an impersonal manner clearly illustrating the idealization of mass production.&lt;ref name="mod" /&gt; 

Andy Warhol is probably the most famous figure in pop art. In fact, art critic Arthur Danto once called Warhol "the nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced".&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt;  Warhol attempted to take pop beyond an artistic style to a life style, and his work often displays a lack of human affectation that dispenses with the irony and parody of many of his peers.&lt;ref&gt;Michelson, Annette, Buchloh, B.

===Early U.S. exhibitions===
[[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Jim Dine]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]] had their first shows in the [[Judson Memorial Church#Sponsorship of the arts|Judson Gallery]] in 1959 and 1960 and later in 1960 through 1964 along with [[James Rosenquist]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]] and others at the [[Green Gallery]] on 57th Street in Manhattan. In 1960, Martha Jackson showed [[Installation art|installations]] and [[Assemblage (art)|assemblages]], ''New Media - New Forms'' featured [[Hans Arp]], [[Kurt Schwitters]], [[Jasper Johns]], Claes Oldenburg, [[Robert Rauschenberg]], Jim Dine and [[May Wilson]]. 1961 was the year of Martha Jackson's spring show, ''Environments, Situations, Spaces''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O:AD:E:4397&amp;page_number=12&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 |title=The Collection |website=MoMA.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tfaoi.com/newsm1/n1m651.htm |title=The Great American Pop Art Store: Multiples of the Sixties |website=Tfaoi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andy Warhol held his first solo exhibition in Los Angeles in July 1962 at [[Ferus Gallery|Irving Blum's Ferus Gallery]], where he showed 32 paintings of Campell's soup cans, one for every flavor. Warhol sold the set of paintings to Blum for $1,000; in 1996, when the Museum of Modern Art acquired it, the set was valued at $15 million.&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt;

Donald Factor, the son of [[Max Factor Jr.]], and an art collector and co-editor of [[avant-garde]] [[literary magazine]] [[Nomad (magazine)|''Nomad'']], wrote an essay in the magazine's last issue, ''Nomad/New York''. The essay was one of the first on what would become known as pop art, though Factor did not use the term. The essay, "Four Artists", focused on Roy Lichtenstein, [[James Rosenquist]], Jim Dine, and Claes Oldenburg.&lt;ref name="Diggory"&gt;Diggory (2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Oldenburg, who became associated with the pop art movement, created many ''[[happening]]s'', which were [[performance art]]-related productions of that time. The name he gave to his own productions was "Ray Gun Theater". The cast of colleagues in his performances included: artists [[Lucas Samaras]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[Carolee Schneemann]], [[Öyvind Fahlström]] and [[Richard Artschwager]]; dealer Annina Nosei; [[art critic]] [[Barbara Rose]]; and screenwriter [[Rudy Wurlitzer]].&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com"&gt;Kristine McKenna (July 2, 1995), [http://articles.latimes.com/1995-07-02/entertainment/ca-19310_1_claes-oldenburg When Bigger Is Better: Claes Oldenburg has spent the past 35 years blowing up and redefining everyday objects, all in the name of getting art off its pedestal] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; His first wife, Patty Mucha, who sewed many of his early soft sculptures, was a constant performer in his happenings. This brash, often humorous, approach to art was at great odds with the prevailing sensibility that, by its nature, art dealt with "profound" expressions or ideas. In December 1961, he rented a store on Manhattan's [[Lower East Side]] to house ''The Store'', a month-long installation he had first presented at the Martha Jackson Gallery in New York, stocked with sculptures roughly in the form of consumer goods.&lt;ref name="articles.latimes.com" /&gt;

Opening in 1962, [[Willem de Kooning]]'s New York art dealer, the [[Sidney Janis]] Gallery, organized the groundbreaking ''International Exhibition of the New Realists'', a survey of new-to-the-scene American, French, Swiss, Italian ''[[New Realism]]'', and British pop art. The fifty-four artists shown included [[Richard Lindner (painter)|Richard Lindner]], [[Wayne Thiebaud]], Roy Lichtenstein (and his painting [[Blam (Roy Lichtenstein)|Blam]]), Andy Warhol, Claes Oldenburg, [[James Rosenquist]], Jim Dine, [[Robert Indiana]], [[Tom Wesselmann]], [[George Segal (artist)|George Segal]], Peter Phillips, Peter Blake (''The Love Wall'' from 1961), [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Christo]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]]. The show was seen by Europeans [[Martial Raysse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Jean Tinguely]] in New York, who were stunned by the size and look of the American artwork. Also shown were [[Marisol Escobar|Marisol]], [[Mario Schifano]], [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Öyvind Fahlström]]. Janis lost some of his abstract expressionist artists when [[Mark Rothko]], [[Robert Motherwell]], [[Adolph Gottlieb]] and [[Philip Guston]] quit the gallery, but gained Dine, Oldenburg, Segal and Wesselmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLgyznMrORsC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;lpg=PA83&amp;dq=New+Realism+at+Sidney+Janis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=2CQXoBBdiS&amp;sig=HBQNsOqvkZvHEEFnWhnhTls-EH4&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=07IbS67CA4TBlAeTt63vCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=New%20Realism%20at%20Sidney%20Janis&amp;f=false |title=Andy Warhol, Poetry, and Gossip in the 1960s |author=Reva Wolf |page=83 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At an opening-night soiree thrown by collector Burton Tremaine, Willem de Kooning appeared and was turned away by Tremaine, who ironically owned a number of de Kooning's works. Rosenquist recalled: "at that moment I thought, something in the art world has definitely changed".&lt;ref name="SchermanTony" /&gt; Turning away a respected abstract artist proved that, as early as 1962, the pop art movement had begun to dominate art culture in New York.

A bit earlier, on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], Roy Lichtenstein, Jim Dine and Andy Warhol from New York City; [[Phillip Hefferton]] and [[Robert Dowd (artist)|Robert Dowd]] from Detroit; [[Edward Ruscha]] and [[Joe Goode]] from Oklahoma City; and Wayne Thiebaud from California were included in the ''[[New Painting of Common Objects]]'' show. This first pop art museum exhibition in America was curated by [[Walter Hopps]] at the [[Pasadena Art Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nortonsimon.org/about/history.aspx |title=Museum History » Norton Simon Museum |website=Nortonsimon.org |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pop art was ready to change the art world. New York followed Pasadena in 1963, when the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim Museum]] exhibited ''Six Painters and the Object'', curated by [[Lawrence Alloway]]. The artists were Jim Dine, Jasper Johns, Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist, and Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/360205683 |title=Six painters and the object.

The show was presented as a typical small supermarket environment, except that everything in it—the produce, canned goods, meat, posters on the wall, etc.—was created by prominent pop artists of the time, including Apple, Warhol, Lichtenstein, Wesselmann, Oldenburg, and Johns. This project was recreated in 2002 as part of the [[Tate Gallery]]'s ''Shopping: A Century of Art and Consumer Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gayford|first=Martin|title=Still life at the check-out|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/3587307/Still-life-at-the-check-out.html|work=The Telegraph|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd|accessdate=28 November 2012|date=2002-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1962, pop artists started exhibiting in commercial galleries in New York and Los Angeles; for some, it was their first commercial one-man show. The [[Ferus Gallery]] presented Andy Warhol in Los Angeles (and [[Ed Ruscha]] in 1963). In New York, the [[Green Gallery]] showed Rosenquist, Segal, Oldenburg, and Wesselmann. The [[Stable Gallery]] showed R. Indiana and Warhol (in his first New York show). The [[Leo Castelli|Leo Castelli Gallery]] presented Rauschenberg, Johns, and Lichtenstein. Martha Jackson showed Jim Dine and Allen Stone showed Wayne Thiebaud. By 1966, after the Green Gallery and the Ferus Gallery closed, the Leo Castelli Gallery represented Rosenquist, Warhol, Rauschenberg, Johns, Lichtenstein and Ruscha. The Sidney Janis Gallery represented Oldenburg, Segal, Dine, Wesselmann and Marisol, while Allen Stone continued to represent Thiebaud, and Martha Jackson continued representing Robert Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;''Pop Artists: Andy Warhol, Pop Art, Roy Lichtenstein, Jasper Johns, Peter Max, Erró, David Hockney, Wally Hedrick, Michael Leavitt'' (May 20, 2010) Reprinted: 2010, General Books, Memphis, Tennessee, USA, {{ISBN|978-1-155-48349-8}}, {{ISBN|1-155-48349-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, the ''[[São Paulo Art Biennial|São Paulo 9 Exhibition – Environment U.S.A.: 1957–1967]]'' featured the "Who's Who" of pop art. Considered as a summation of the ''classical phase'' of the American pop art period, the exhibit was curated by William Seitz. The artists were [[Edward Hopper]], [[James Gill (artist)|James Gill]], [[Robert Indiana]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Tom Wesselmann]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Edwards, William Emboden, David McCarthy: ''Uncommonplaces: The Art of James Francis Gill'', 2005, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Nouveau réalisme]]'' refers to an artistic movement founded in 1960 by the art critic [[Pierre Restany]]&lt;ref&gt;Karl Ruhrberg, Ingo F. Walther, ''Art of the 20th Century'', Taschen, 2000, p. 518. {{ISBN|3-8228-5907-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the artist [[Yves Klein]] during the first collective exposition in the Apollinaire gallery in Milan. Pierre Restany wrote the original manifesto for the group, titled the "Constitutive Declaration of New Realism," in April 1960, proclaiming, "Nouveau Réalisme—new ways of perceiving the real."&lt;ref name=Stremmel13&gt;Kerstin Stremmel, ''Realism'', Taschen, 2004, p. 13. {{ISBN|3-8228-2942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This joint declaration was signed on 27 October 1960, in Yves Klein's workshop, by nine people: [[Yves Klein]], [[Arman]], [[Martial Raysse]], [[Pierre Restany]], [[Daniel Spoerri]], [[Jean Tinguely]] and the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s, [[Francois Dufrêne]], [[Raymond Hains]], [[Jacques de la Villeglé]]; in 1961 these were joined by [[César Baldaccini|César]], [[Mimmo Rotella]], then [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Gérard Deschamps]]. The artist [[Christo]] showed with the group. It was dissolved in 1970.&lt;ref name=Stremmel13/&gt;

Contemporary of American Pop Art—often conceived as its transposition in France—new realism was along with [[Fluxus]] and other groups one of the numerous tendencies of the avant-garde in the 1960s. The group initially chose [[Nice (France)|Nice]], on the French Riviera, as its home base since Klein and Arman both originated there; new realism is thus often retrospectively considered by historians to be an early representative of the {{Ill|École de Nice|fr}} movement.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary M. O'Neill, ''Art and Visual Culture on the French Riviera, 1956–1971: The Ecole de Nice'', Ashgate, 2012, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the diversity of their plastic language, they perceived a common basis for their work; this being a method of direct [[Appropriation (art)|appropriation]] of reality, equivalent, in the terms used by Restany; to a "poetic recycling of urban, industrial and advertising reality".&lt;ref&gt;60/90.

In Spain, the study of pop art is associated with the "new figurative", which arose from the roots of the crisis of [[informalism]]. [[Eduardo Arroyo]] could be said to fit within the pop art trend, on account of his interest in the environment, his critique of our media culture which incorporates icons of both [[mass media]] communication and the history of painting, and his scorn for nearly all established artistic styles. However, the Spanish artist who could be considered most authentically part of "pop" art is Alfredo Alcaín, because of the use he makes of popular images and empty spaces in his compositions.

Also in the category of Spanish pop art is the "Chronicle Team" (''El Equipo Crónica''), which existed in [[Valencia (city in Spain)|Valencia]] between 1964 and 1981, formed by the artists [[Manolo Valdés]] and Rafael Solbes. Their movement can be characterized as "pop" because of its use of comics and publicity images and its simplification of images and photographic compositions. [[Film]]maker [[Pedro Almodóvar]] emerged from Madrid's "La Movida" subculture of the 1970s making low budget [[Super 8 mm film|super 8]] pop art movies, and he was subsequently called the Andy Warhol of Spain by the media at the time. In the book ''Almodovar on Almodovar'', he is quoted as saying that the 1950s film "Funny Face" was a central inspiration for his work. One pop trademark in Almodovar's films is that he always produces a fake commercial to be inserted into a scene.

==Japan==
In Japan, pop art evolved from the nation's prominent [[avant-garde]] scene. The use of images of the modern world, copied from magazines in the photomontage-style paintings produced by [[Harue Koga]] in the late 1920s and early 1930s, foreshadowed elements of pop art.&lt;ref name="eskolahk"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eskola|first=Jack|title=Harue Koga: David Bowie of the Early 20th Century Japanese Art Avant-garde|year=2015|publisher=Kindle, e-book}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of [[Yayoi Kusama]] contributed to the development of pop art and influenced many other artists, including Andy Warhol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2175/interview-yayoi-kusama |title=Yayoi Kusama interview – Yayoi Kusama exhibition |website=Timeout.com |date=2013-01-30 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101110936/http://art.sy/artist/yayoi-kusama|date=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1960s, graphic designer [[Tadanori Yokoo]] became one of the most successful pop artists and an international symbol for Japanese pop art. He is well known for his advertisements and creating artwork for pop culture icons such as commissions from [[The Beatles]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Elizabeth Taylor]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adcglobal.org/archive/hof/2000/?id=205 |title=Tadanori Yokoo : ADC • Global Awards &amp; Club |website=Adcglobal.org |date=1936-06-27 |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another leading pop artist at that time was [[Keiichi Tanaami]]. Iconic characters from Japanese [[manga]] and [[anime]] have also become symbols for pop art, such as [[Speed Racer]] and [[Astro Boy]]. Japanese manga and anime also influenced later pop artists such as [[Takashi Murakami]] and his [[superflat]] movement.

==Italy==
In Italy, by 1964, pop art was known and took different forms, such as the "Scuola di Piazza del Popolo" in Rome, with pop artists such as [[Mario Schifano]], [[Franco Angeli]], [[Giosetta Fioroni]], [[Tano Festa]], [[Claudio Cintoli]], and some artworks by [[Piero Manzoni]], [[Lucio Del Pezzo]], [[Mimmo Rotella]] and [[Valerio Adami]].

Italian pop art originated in 1950s culture – the works of the artists [[Enrico Baj]] and [[Mimmo Rotella]] to be precise, rightly considered the forerunners of this scene. In fact, it was around 1958–1959 that Baj and Rotella abandoned their previous careers (which might be generically defined as belonging to a ''non-representational genre'', despite being thoroughly post-Dadaist), to catapult themselves into a new world of images, and the reflections on them, which was springing up all around them. Rotella's torn posters showed an ever more figurative taste, often explicitly and deliberately referring to the great icons of the times. Baj's compositions were steeped in contemporary ''kitsch'', which turned out to be a "gold mine" of images and the stimulus for an entire generation of artists.

The novelty came from the new visual panorama, both inside "domestic walls" and out-of-doors. Cars, road signs, television, all the "new world", everything can belong to the world of art, which itself is new. In this respect, Italian pop art takes the same ideological path as that of the international scene. The only thing that changes is the iconography and, in some cases, the presence of a more critical attitude toward it. Even in this case, the prototypes can be traced back to the works of Rotella and Baj, both far from neutral in their relationship with society. Yet this is not an exclusive element; there is a long line of artists, including [[Gianni Ruffi]], [[Roberto Barni]], [[Silvio Pasotti]], [[Umberto Bignardi]], and [[Claudio Cintoli]], who take on reality as a toy, as a great pool of imagery from which to draw material with disenchantment and frivolity, questioning the traditional linguistic role models with a renewed spirit of "let me have fun" à la [[Aldo Palazzeschi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.modena.it/galleria/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/2005/pop-art-italia-1958-1968-1 |title=Pop Art Italia 1958-1968 — Galleria Civica |website=Comune.modena.it |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Belgium==
In [[Belgium]], pop art was represented by [[Paul Van Hoeydonck]], whose sculpture ''[[Fallen Astronaut]]'' was left on the moon during one of the moon missions. Internationally recognized artists such as [[Marcel Broodthaers]] ('' 'vous êtes doll? "'') and [[Panamarenko]] are indebted to the pop art movement; Broodthaers's great influence was [[George Segal]].  Another well-known artist, [[Roger Raveel]], mounted a birdcage with a real live pigeon in one of his paintings. By the end of the 1960s and early 1970s, pop art references disappeared from the work of these artists when they started to adopt a more critical attitude towards America because of the [[Vietnam War]]'s increasingly gruesome character. Panamarenko, however, has retained the irony inherent in the pop art movement up to the present day.

==Netherlands==
While there was no formal pop art movement in the [[Netherlands]], there were a group of artists that spent time in New York during the early years of pop art, and drew inspiration from the international pop art movement. Representatives of Dutch pop art include [[Daan van Golden]], [[Gustave Asselbergs]], [[Jacques Frenken]], [[Jan Cremer]], [[Wim T. Schippers]], and [[Woody van Amen]]. They opposed the Dutch [[petit bourgeois]] mentality by creating humorous works with a serious undertone. Examples of this nature include ''Sex O'Clock,'' by Woody van Amen, and ''Crucifix / Target'', by Jacques Frenken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.8weekly.nl/artikel/2701/ |title=Dutch Pop Art &amp; The Sixties - Weg met de vertrutting! |website=8weekly.nl |date= |accessdate=2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russian Federation==
[[Russia]] was a little late to become part of the pop art movement, and some of the artwork that resembles pop art only surfaced around the early 1970s. Russia was a communist country at that point and bold artistic statements were closely monitored. Russia's own version of pop art was [[Soviet]]-themed and was referred to as ''[[Sots Art]]''. After 1991, the Communist Party lost its power and the Russian revolution was beginning, and with it came a freedom to express. That is when pop art in Russia took on another form, epitomised by [[Dmitri Vrubel]] with his painting titled ''[[My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love]]'' in 1990. One might argue that the Soviet posters made in the 1950s to promote the wealth of the nation were in itself a form of pop art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canofart.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130607022802/http://www.canofart.com/|date=June 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Short prose''' is a generic term for various kinds of very short [[fictional]] [[prose]]; short prose may or may not be [[narrative]]. Short prose pieces are considerably shorter than a [[short story]], i.e., usually less than c. 1,000 words. Because of their small size, short prose pieces can attain high levels of lexical density and may thereby resemble [[prose poetry|prose poems]], but the focus in short prose is less on language itself (and thus on [[rhythm]], metre, or other phonological effects) than on the rapid presentation of a situation.

A piece of short prose may contain [[drama]], but it normally differs from a [[vignette (literature)|vignette]] in that it has no necessary associations with theatre or character. Because [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is peripheral to, or nonexistent in, short prose, a short prose piece differs from a [[sketch story]] in that it does not necessarily invite the reader to imagine what came before or what follows after. Finally, because a piece of short prose does not necessarily have characters, conflict, or resolution, it usually differs from the [[short short story]], [[flash fiction]] and [[microfiction]] as these are usually defined.

Writers who have favoured the use of short prose include [[Fyodor Sologub]], [[Daniil Kharms]] (Случаи), [[Dezső Kosztolányi]], [[István Örkény]] (''Egyperces novellák''), Samuel Beckett ([[Fizzles]]), [[Francis Ponge]] (''[[Le parti pris des choses]]''), [[David Eggers]] (''[[Short Short Stories]]''),  [[Eduardo Berti]] (''[[La Vie Impossible]]'').

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1999">The '''Spanish era''' or '''era of Caesar''' was a dating system commonly used in the states of the [[Iberian peninsula]] until the 14th–15th centuries, when it was phased out in favour the ''[[Anno Domini]]'' system. The calendar began with year one in what is 38 BC,&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"&gt;Roth, Norman. ''Medieval Iberia An Encyclopedia''. Routledge, 2003, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; possibly the date of a new tax imposed by the [[Roman Republic]] on the subdued population of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]].{{cn|date=October 2017}} Whatever the case, the date signifies the beginning of the ''[[Pax Romana]]'' in Iberia. To convert from an ''Anno Domini'' date to the corresponding year in the Spanish era, add 38 to the ''Anno Domini'' year.&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"/&gt; A date in the Spanish era was written thus: "Era CMXLI" for "anno domini 903".

The use of the Caesar Era probably began in Iberia in the 3rd century. The reason for its particular popularity is unknown. Official usage ceased in different parts of the Iberian peninsula at different times: in [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in 1349, [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] 1358, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] 1383 and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] 1422. While the year officially began on 1 January under the Spanish era, that was changed to 25 December when the ''Anno Domini'' system was adopted. (The church, however, used 11 January.)&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6780">'''Split labor market theory''' was proposed by sociologist [[Edna Bonacich]] in the early 1970s as an attempt to explain racial/ethnic tensions and [[labor market segmentation]] by [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]]/[[ethnicity]] in terms of [[social structure]] and [[political power]] rather than individual-level [[prejudice]].&lt;ref name="Bonacich"&gt;{{cite journal 
|last= Bonacich 
|first= Edna 
|date=October 1972 
|title= A Theory of Ethnic Antagonism: The Split Labor Market 
|journal= American Sociological Review 
|volume= 37 
|issue= 5 
|pages= 547–559 
|accessdate= |quote= 
|doi= 10.2307/2093450
|jstor=2093450 
|pmid= 4634743}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonacich argues that ethnic antagonism emerges from a split [[labor market]], where two or more racially/ethnically distinct groups of workers vie for the same jobs, and where the total cost to the employer (including wages) of hiring workers from one group is significantly lower than the cost of hiring from the other group. Employers (or [[capitalism|capitalists]]) prefer to hire cheaper workers and will do so absent active opposition from higher-priced workers, creating an antagonism between higher- and lower-priced groups. Differences in the price of labor are sociological and political in nature, not a matter of personal preference, so that, e.g., native, unionized workers, who enjoy full political rights will demand higher wages and be more likely to resist employer prerogatives than [[undocumented immigrant]], non-union workers from poorer countries. According to Bonacich, likely outcomes of a split labor market include not only antagonism but, depending on the political power of higher-priced workers, a [[caste]]-like system where lower-priced workers are restricted to specific occupations, or total exclusion of the lower-priced group from the labor market.

==Dynamics of three labor groups==

Conflict develops between these three classes because each has a different interest.

''Business or employers (white capitalists)'' aim to have a cheap and docile labor force in order to compete effectively with other businesses and maximize economic return.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  Business will dispense with and undercut the white working-class if they could, and have done so when they have the opportunity.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;

''Higher paid labor'', otherwise called the "primary labor market", is threatened by introduction of cheaper labor into their market fearing that it will force them to leave the workplace or reduce their pay level.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  If the Higher Paid Labor is strong enough or possess the power resources, they can prevent being replaced or undercut by cheaper labor through [[wikt:exclusion|exclusion]] movements or creating [[caste systems]] (exclusiveness or aristocracy of labor).&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;

''Cheaper labor'', also called the "secondary labor market", is used by the employer to undermine the position of more expensive labor through strikebreaking and undercutting.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  Cheaper laborers are usually unskilled, but can be trained.

==Economics of discrimination==

The split labor market theory attributes events to social structure rather than to individual preferences.  It is a form of [[conflict theory]] in that it sees [[discrimination]] as a result of the conflict between competing interest groups.&lt;ref name="Farley"&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Farley
  | first = John E.
  | title = Majority-Minority Relations
  | publisher = [[Prentice Hall]]
  | series = Edition 2
  | year = 1988
  | isbn = 0-13-545625-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "The business owner or capitalist ''recognizes'' that racial discrimination is dysfunctional for the business enterprise and prefers ''not'' to discriminate.  The objective of the capitalist is to get the best worker for the cheapest wage, and it is therefore in the capitalist's interest ''not'' to discriminate, because discrimination limits the pool of workers available for the position.  Accordingly, those doing the hiring discriminate ''not'' because they have a 'taste for discrimination', but rather because they might have been ''forced'' to do so by the laborers that do benefit" (Farley).  Higher paid laborers may be able to impose a system of discrimination in a number of ways.&lt;ref name="Farley"/&gt;  Discrimination occurs in a split labor market because workers benefit when they eliminate minority competition.&lt;ref name="Farley"/&gt;

==Ethnic antagonism in relation to split labor market==

Ethnic [[wikt:antagonism|antagonism]] is produced when competition arises from a price differential.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  A source of antagonism between ethnic groups is assumed to be a split labor market or one in which there is a large differential in price of labor for the same occupation/work.  The price of labor is not a response to the race or ethnicity of those entering the labor market.  A price differential results from differences in resources and motives which are often correlates of ethnicity.&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;

==Conclusion==

According to Bonacich, "The central hypothesis [deriving from split labor market theory] is that ethnic antagonism first germinates in a labor market split along racial lines".&lt;ref name="Bonacich"/&gt;  Split labor market theory traces the roots of racial/ethnic stratification to social and political differences that predate inter-group contact in the labor market, but the specific outcomes (caste system, exclusion, or something else) result mainly from the actions of the higher paid segment of the working class and their power relative to that of capital.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{Cite book

In one of the best-known applications of split labor market theory, [[William Julius Wilson]] argued in ''The Declining Significance of Race'' that a split labor market provided much of the racial antagonism between blacks and whites during the earlier years of what he called the period of industrial race relations.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; Wilson argued that this did not last, however, as "the passage of protective union legislation during the New Deal era, and the equal employment legislation in the early sixties have virtually eliminated the tendency of employers to create a split labor market in which black labor is deemed cheaper than white labor regardless of the work performed".&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

'''''Studies in Comparative Religion''''' was a quarterly [[academic journal]] published from 1963 to 1987 that contained essays on the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] practices and [[religious symbolism]] of the world's religions. The journal was notable for the number of prominent [[Perennial philosophy|Perennialists]] who contributed to it. It was also notable for being the first [[English language|English-language]] journal focused on the subject of traditional studies and [[comparative religion]].

== History ==
The journal was established in 1963 by [[Francis Clive-Ross]], who also served as [[editor-in-chief]] and publisher. From 1963 to 1967 the journal was published under the name ''Tomorrow''. Perennialist author [[William Stoddart]] also served as an assistant editor for many years. [[Jacob Needleman]], editor of ''The Penguin Metaphysical Library'', published a collection of essays from ''Studies in Comparative Religion'' under the title "The Sword of Gnosis". The journal ceased publication in 1987 and the articles were unavailable until 2007, when [[World Wisdom]] launched a free on-line [[archive]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28270">'''Text and conversation''' is a [[theory]] in the field of [[organizational communication]] illustrating how [[communication]] makes up an [[organization]]. In the theory's simplest explanation, an organization is created and defined by communication. Communication "is" the organization and the organization exists because communication takes place.  The theory is built on the notion, an organization is not seen as a physical unit holding communication.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005"&gt;Miller, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Text and conversation theory puts communication processes at the heart of organizational communication and postulates, an organization doesn't contain communication as a "causal influence",&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt; but is formed by the communication within. This theory is not intended for direct application, but rather to explain how communication exists. The theory provides a [[conceptual framework|framework]] for better understanding organizational communication.

Since the foundation of organizations are in communication,&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999"&gt;Taylor, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  an organization cannot exist without communication, and the organization is defined as the result of communications happening within its context. Communications begin with individuals within the organization discussing [[beliefs]], [[goal]]s, [[structure]]s, [[plans]] and relationships. These communicators achieve this through constant development, delivery, and translation of "text and conversation". The theory proposes mechanisms of communications are "[[literary work|text]] and "[[conversation]]".

== Definitions ==
The foundation of this theory is the concepts of text and conversation. Text is defined as the content of [[interaction]], or what is said in an interaction. Text is the meaning made available to individuals through a [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] or electronic mode of communication. Conversation is defined as what is happening behaviorally between two or more participants in the communication process. Conversation is the exchange or interaction itself.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999" /&gt;

The process of the text and conversation exchange is [[reciprocal determinism|reciprocal]]: text needs conversation and vice versa for the process of communication to occur. Text, or content, must have context to be effective and a conversation, or discourse, needs to have a beginning, middle and end. Individuals create the beginning, middle and end by using [[punctuation]], [[bracketing]] or [[framing (social sciences)|framing]]. When conversation is coupled with text, or meaning, communication occurs.&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999" /&gt; Taylor submits this process is a translation process of: translation of text to conversation and the [[translation]] of conversation into text.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;
*"text" = content and meaning
*"conversation" = [[discourse]] and exchange

== Theorist ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:James renwick taylor.jpg|thumb|James R. Taylor]] --&gt;

[[James R. Taylor]], introduced text and conversation theory in 1996 with [[François Cooren]], Giroux and Robichaud and then further explored the theory in 1999.  Taylor drew on the work of sociologist and educator [[John Dewey| John Dewey’s]] pragmatic view society exists not "by" but "in" communication.  Taylor followed the same principle, putting communication as the essence of an organization.
He was born in 1928 and is [[Professor Emeritus]] at the Department of Communication of the [[Université de Montréal]], which he founded in the early 1970s. Drawing from research in fields of [[Industrial and organizational psychology|organizational psychology]] ([[Karl E. Weick]]), [[ethnomethodology]] ([[Harold Garfinkel]]), Deirdre Boden), [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]] ([[Alfred Schütz]]) and collective minding ([[Edwin Hutchins]]), Taylor formed the original text and conversation theory. This line of thought has come to be known as "The Montreal School" of organizational communication, sometimes referred to as TMS, and has been acknowledged as an original theory by authors such as [[Haridimos Tsoukas]], Linda Putman, and Karl E. Weick.
*Taylor said,"...organization emerges in communication, which thus furnishes not only the site of its appearance to its members, but also the surface on which members read the meaning of the organization to them." Taylor argues communication is the "site and emergence of organization."&lt;ref name="Taylor, 1999" /&gt;

== Foundational theories ==

=== Structuration theory ===
"[[Structuration theory]]" identifies how text and conversation theory evolved from this communication construct.  Proposed by [[Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens|Anthony Giddens]] (1984) in ‘’The Constitution on Society,’’ structuration theory, originated in the discipline of sociology.  Giddens’ theory has been adapted to the field of communication, particularly organizational communication; specifically, how and why [[structural change]]s are possible and the duality of formal and informal communication.
This theory is based on concepts of [[structure and agency]].  structure is defined as rules and resources of an organization; agency is the free will to choose to do otherwise than prescribed through structure.
*"structure":  is rules and resources, the reason we do things because of the structure of how we were raised (culture, sociological and [[physiological]]).  Giddens (1984) explains these rules as recipes or procedures for accomplishing tasks within an organization.  Resources have two subsets: allocative and authoritative, which can be leveraged to accomplish desired outcomes.  Allocative are quantitative resources, while authoritative are qualitative.
*"[[Agency (sociology)|agency]]": is the free will to choose to do otherwise. Agency is the reason people do things, because they have a choice&lt;ref&gt;Gidden, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the process individuals internalize actions and make choices, rather than making decisions because the structure says they should.  Structure is based on the formal organization and accepted policy. Agency is informal communication and individually based.
*"Dualism": mutually exclusive answer (i.e., either/or)
*"Duality": mutually constitutive answer (i.e., both/and)
*"[[Structuration]]": society itself is located in a [[duality of structure]] in which the enactments of agency become structures that, across time, produce possibilities for agency enactment.
*Another way explain it is structure is the context.
Structuration theory identifies [[structure and agency]] as coexisting. Formal rules and resources impact informal communication and discourse. This duality and coexistence ensures a cyclical nature between structure and agency, which has a cause and effect:  new structure and agency is created from the causal relationships of previous structure and agency decisions. The concept to understanding structuration is to understand to duality of structure &lt;ref&gt;Hoffman and Cowan, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of Giddens’ theory and conversation and text theory is a mutual-existing and causal relationship of communication. The main difference, between the two, is structuration theory explains how communication impacts the organization, text and conversation, by means of structure and agency. Giddens' construct of structuration explains how mutually causal relationships constitute the essence of an organization. This concept illustrates how communication within an organization depends on the translation of meaning.

=== Conversation theory ===
"[[Conversation theory]]", proposed by [[Gordon Pask]] in the 1970s, identifies a framework to explain how [[scientific theory]] and interactions formulate the "construction of knowledge"&lt;ref&gt;Pask, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;
Conversation Theory is based on the idea [[social system]]s are symbolic and language-oriented.  Additionally, these systems are based on responses and interpretations, and the meaning interpreted by individuals via communication&lt;ref&gt;Pask, 1975, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;
This theory is based on interaction between two or more individuals, with unlike perspectives&lt;ref&gt;Scott, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  The significance of having unlike perspectives is that it enables a distinctive standpoint:  it permits the ability to study how people identify differences and understand meaning.  Additionally, these differences create shared and consensual pockets of interactions and communications as discussed in [[Structure-Organization-Process]].&lt;ref&gt;Maturana and Varela, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;
Another idea of conversation theory is learning happens by exchanges about issues, which assists in making [[knowledge]] explicit.  In order for this to happen, Pask organized three levels of conversation, according to:&lt;ref name="cortland1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/Pask.htm |title=Conversation Theory&amp;nbsp;— Gordon Pask |publisher=Web.cortland.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[Natural language]]": general discussion
*"[[Object language]]s": for discussing the subject matter
*"[[Metalanguages]]": for talking about learning/language
Additionally, to facilitate learning, Pask proposed two types of learning strategies.&lt;ref name="cortland1" /&gt;
*"Serialists": progress through a structure in a sequential fashion
*"[[Holist]]s": look for higher order relations
Ultimately, Pask found versatile learners neither favor one approach over the other. Rather, they understand how both approaches are integrated into the structure of learning. The similarities of conversation theory and text and conversation theory are they both focus on the foundational aspects of meaning. Specifically, how and why meaning is established and interpreted amongst individuals. However, the difference between the two theories is conversation theory specifically focuses on the dynamics of two people. Text and conversation theory is typically applied to at least two people. Conversation theory emphasizes the construct of knowledge of meaning and the [[Causality|cause and effect]] relationship that occurs as a result of [[Autodidacticism|self-learning]] from communication, based on meaning.

== Factors ==

=== Meaning ===
{{See also|Meaning-making}}
"Meaning management" is the control of "context" and "message" to accomplish a desired communication effect. According to Fairhurst, leaders are change agents&lt;ref name=fair2011&gt;{{harvnb|Fairhurst|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leaders define the value of the organization and shape communication by implementing unique organizational communication approaches. Within an organization, leaders and managers establish the framework for communication, which helps to manage meaning. "Leaders" provide information to followers, such as the organizations’ mission, vision, values, as well as its [[collective identity]] &lt;ref&gt;Fairhurst, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrary to leaders, "managers" are responsible for day to day [[problem solving]]. Their core framing tasks are solving problems and stimulating others to find solutions.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt;

Individuals, regardless of positional authority, can manage meaning. Meaning management is to communicate with a specific goal by controlling the context and message&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt; Individuals utilizing meaning management are communicating and shaping the meaning by using the power of framing.

=== Culture ===
"[[Culture]]" is a unique set of behaviors, including language, belief and customs learnt from being raised in [[social group]]s or by joining a particular group throughout time. Culture defines context and is the social totality that defines behavior, knowledge, beliefs and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]]. It is a set of shared values characterizing a specific organization. Fairhurst identifies culture as defining events, people, objects, and concepts.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt; Communication and culture are intertwined. Shared language of a group links together individuals and joins common cultures. Culture influences [[mental model]]s. "Mental models" are the images in your mind about other people, yourself, substance and events.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt;

Additionally, culture defines [[social interaction]]s and how individuals and groups interpret and apply context. Organizations with good communication foundation are able to interpret and differentiate individuals’ cultural discourses, as well as creatively combine and constrain these discourses.&lt;ref name="Fairhurst, 2007"&gt;Fairhurst, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ir defines the ideological basis for people and lays the foundation for how they frame and can be observed and described, but not controlled. It is defined by the group or individual accepting the specific patterns of behavior, knowledge, or beliefs  Individuals can shape culture and make changes over time, as long as they are clear about specific attitudes and behaviors that are desired &lt;ref name="Fairhurst, 2007"/&gt;  As [[Weick]] and Sutcliffe (2007) discussed, culture can be changed through symbols, values, and content&amp;nbsp;— organizations shape culture.  An [[organizational culture]] emerges from a set of expectations that matter to people, from things like [inclusion, exclusion, praise, positive feelings, [[social support]], isolation, care, indifference, excitement and anger &lt;ref&gt;Weick and Suitcliffe, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Individuals are shaped by an organization's culture.  However, an organization has its own culture. According to Martin (1985), within that organizational culture, three forms of culture can result: integration, differentiation and fragmentation.
*"[[Social integration|Integration]]" (bring people together)
*"[[Differentiation (sociology)|Differentiation]]" (act or process by which people undergo change toward more specialized function)
*"[[Fragmentation (sociology)|Fragmentation]]" (process of state of breaking or being broken into smaller parts)
With Integration, all organizational members consistently share values and assumptions about work. As a result the members of the organization share uniquely organizational experiences and thus, a unique culture&lt;ref name="Martin, 1985"&gt;Martin, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;
If differentiation occurs, cultures are not unitary. Sub-groups consistently share values and assumptions about work.  Members tend to operate in different areas, different projects and at different levels of the hierarchy.&lt;ref name="Martin, 1985" /&gt;
Cultures are often ambiguous if fragmentation happens. Individuals are interconnected with some members and disconnected with others. This creates inconsistently shared values and assumptions about the organization&lt;ref name="Martin, 1985" /&gt; As a result friendship/romantic as well as enemy/competitor type relationships are cut across an organization’s sub-groups.

=== Structure ===
Individuals who understand the structure and inner working of their organizations can leverage knowledge toward achieving communication goals. Likewise, organizations can also leverage their hierarchical structures to achieve targeted outcomes.
Two types of structures exist within an organization.
*"[[Hierarchical]]" (formal hierarchical structure, typical flow/pyramid chart)
*"Network" (informal structure, based on relationships, go to people, subject-matter experts)
Goldsmith and Katzenback (2008) explained organizations must understand the informal organization. For example, of being a part of an informal or formal structure, it is important for managers to learn to recognize signs of trouble in order to shape context as they attempt to coordinate meaning and solve day-to-day problems. Specific implications for [[organizational learning]] include enhanced performance, coordinated activity and structure, [[division of labor]] and collective goal setting &lt;ref name="BEA07"&gt;Bryan et al, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
While a formal organization is visually represented by a typical hierarchical structure, it visually shows how formal responsibilities are spread, as well as job dispersal and the flow of information&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith and Katzenback, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, the informal organization embodies how people network to accomplish the job, via social relationships and connections or [[subject-matter expert]]s that are not represented on the organizational chart&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith and Katzenbach, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  By leveraging this informal organization, people within the organization are able to use their [[social network]] to access and shape the [[decision-making process]]es quicker, as well as establish cross-structural collaboration amongst themselves.
Additionally, by understanding and using both structures, leaders and managers are able to learn more about their people.  Interpreting all forms of communication, verbal and visual, whether you are a supervisor or a subordinate is invaluable.  The hierarchical and network structures can allow an organization to recognize signs of trouble from people, accomplish core framing tasks, and to be able to communicate with mindfulness and meaning.  By unlocking the value of an organization's structure, leaders and managers can use this knowledge to boost performance or achieve specific goals.&lt;ref name="BEA07"/&gt; Signs of trouble can be emotional, hidden, physical, or in plain sight.

=== Knowledge ===
Knowing individuals’ personalities, conflict tendencies, as well as their unique circumstances help an organization to understand its [[mental model]]s and cultural discourse.  Additionally, by noticing abnormalities and not being blind to details, an organization should be able to recognize signs of trouble within day-to-day operations and management, whether it is fraud, lack of maintenance standards, [[sexual harassment]], or even a poor framework for communication.
Understanding and the ability to recognize signs of trouble empower managers to employ the rules of reality construction:  control the context, define the situation, apply ethics, interpret uncertainty, and design the response, which leads to communicating by a structured way of thinking.&lt;ref name=fair2011/&gt;

Ultimately, by understanding how an organization works, you enhance communication collectively.&lt;ref name="BEA07" /&gt; Additionally, by knowing how employees and relationships are shaped and the context that defines how each person interacts with one another, you can shape contagious emotions.
Basic building blocks of Taylor’s theories is the relationship of text and conversation, and how that relationship requires a "two-step translational process"&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;
*translation One:  From text to conversation
*translation Two: From conversation to text
Following this translational process, text and conversation is transferred to organizational communication. If context, or text, defines the organization then ongoing introductions and meaning are crucial to define what is meant by the term organization.&lt;ref name="Miller, 2005" /&gt;
To examine this further, Taylor defined "six degrees of separation" to understand organizational communication:&lt;ref&gt;Taylor et al, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;
*First Degree of Separation: Intent of speaker is translated into action and embedded in conversation.
*Second Degree of Separation: Events of the conversation are translated into a narrative representation, making it possible to understand the meaning of the exchange.
*Third Degree of Separation: The text is transcribed (objectified) on some permanent or semi-permanent medium (e.g., the minutes of a meeting are taken down in writing).
*Fourth Degree of Separation: A specialized language is developed to encourage and channel subsequent texts and conversations(e.g., lawyers develop specific ways of talking in court, with each other, and in documents).
*Fifth Degree of Separation: The texts and conversations are transformed into material and physical frames (e.g., laboratories, conference rooms, organizational charts, procedural manuals).
*Sixth Degree of Separation: The standardized form is disseminated and diffused to a broader public (e.g., media reports and representations of organizational forms and practices).

== Impact ==
This theory uses interactions of text and conversation to construct networks of relationships. By doing so, the theory enables a deep understanding of personal communication within an organization. Additionally, it explains how that communication ends up actually defining the organization, rather than the individuals within the organization. Taylor’s theory places more importance on personal communication, rather than individuals. The practical application, as a result, is communication behaviors can constitute how and what we think of an organization. Additionally, by manipulating communication processes, not only could structure be altered, but the entire organization could be changed as well&lt;ref name="Heath et al, 2006"&gt;Heath et al, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; whether change is beneficial or negative, is based on desired meaning, or context and message, people within the organization want to exchange and translate.

Taylor stresses the importance and impact of dialogue, specifically relating to how people interact with one another and interpret context. Taylor explains in Heath et al. (2006) that virtuous reasoning embodies entire discussions. Additionally, he points out dialogue should not prevent issues that arise from debate&lt;ref name="Heath et al, 2006"/&gt; Since 1993, Taylor’s theory has been the focus of more than six organizational communication books. Additionally, Taylor’s ideas are referred to as "The Montreal School" of organizational communication&lt;ref name="cortland1" /&gt; Within the field of communication, TMS has been recognized for its contributions to organizational communication as well as related disciplines. Books focusing on text and conversation theory have sold internationally&lt;ref name="cortland1" /&gt; One to the largest and simplest contributions this theory provided the communication academic field was the ability to describe and characterize and organization. From this, people could better understand and fully construct and organization’s identity.

== Weakness ==
According to Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995), [[organizational learning]] is the study of how collectives adapt to, or fail to adapt to, their environments.  It utilizes tacit knowledge and explicit knowledge.
*"[[Tacit Knowledge]]": personal, contextual, subjective, implicit, and unarticulated
*"[[Explicit Knowledge]]": codified, systematic, formal, explicit, and articulated
Ultimately, organizational learning achieves enhanced performance, coordinated activity and structure, and achievement of collective goals by externalization and internalization.
*"[[Externalization]]": getting key workers to make their tacit knowledge the organization’s explicit knowledge that can be shared
*"[[Internalization]]": getting the organization’s explicit knowledge to become workers’ tacit knowledge
Text and conversation theory places significant challenges and burdens on the organization to articulate knowledge.  Whether knowledge is passed directly by individuals, up and down or horizontally on the formal or informal organizational structure, there is no guarantee text has proper context to be effective as conversation.  Additionally, conversation codes are influenced by how the organization ensures knowledge carriers pass information and communicate with purpose, message, and meaning.
How information is passed can be unclear, and consistently has to adapt to new challenges.  Some of these challenges, or factors, include how individuals and an organization adapt to meaning, culture, structure, and knowledge, in order to communicate.
Ultimately, within the organization itself, people are impacted by bias’ on group and individual levels.

"Problems with Group Learning"
*Responsibility bias:  belief of group members’ that someone else in the group will do the work
*[[Social desirability bias]]:  group members are reluctant to provide critical assessments for fear of losing face or relational status
*Hierarchical mum effect:  subordinates’ reluctance to provide negative feedback for fear of harming identifies of superiors
*[[Groupthink]]:  failure to consider decision alternatives
*Identification/[[ego defense]]:  highly identified group members begin to associate their identify with their group membership and will in turn refuse to see the group as wrong, and themselves by extension
"Problems with Individual Learning"
*[[Confirmation bias]]:  individuals seeks to confirm their own ideas, guesses and beliefs rather than seek dis-confirming information
*[[Hindsight bias]]:  individuals tend to forget when their predictions are wrong
*[[Fundamental attribution error]]:  individuals tend to attribute others shortcomings to their character, while attributing their own shortcomings to external forces

'''Theophilus (Gottlieb) Siegfried Bayer'''(1694–1738), was a [[Germans|German]] [[Classics|classical scholar]] with specialization in [[Sinology]].&lt;ref name="R1"&gt;
{{cite web |url= http://www.sciencephoto.com/media/75035/enlarge |title= De Eclipsi Sinica, frontispiece |work= sciencephoto.com |publisher= ROYAL ASTRONOMICAL SOCIETY/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY |accessdate= January 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Sinology|Sinologist]] and professor of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman Antiquities]] at [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] between 1726 and 1737.&lt;ref name="R2"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/manuscripts/search/detailp.cfm?NID=11408&amp;DID=&amp;AID=10030.0 |title= Manuscripts - Name Details - Name: Theophilus Gottlieb Siegfried Bayer  |work= special.lib.gla.ac.uk |publisher= University of Glasgow|accessdate= January 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal details==

Bayer was a native of [[Königsberg]], [[East Prussia]]. His father Johann Friedrich was from the German Protestant minority in Hungary, but had moved to East Prussia where he worked as a painter.&lt;ref&gt;Lundbaek, Knud ''T. S. Bayer(1694-1738) Pioneer Sinologist'' London 1986  p.12 {{ISBN|0700701893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youthful T. S. Bayer was an excellent student at the [[University of Königsberg]], studying Latin, Greek and Hebrew.&lt;ref&gt;Lundbaek, Knud ''T. S. Bayer(1694-1738) Pioneer Sinologist'' London 1986  p.13 {{ISBN|0700701893}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of the [[Königsberg Cathedral]] from 1721 to 1726,&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt; and also worked as a librarian at the [[Königsberg Public Library]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;

==Bayer collection==
He had a library of more than 200 manuscripts, Chinese and other [[Orient]]al books, including:
* [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]] [[Palm-leaf manuscript]]s
* Oriental history and [[philology]]-related notes
* Correspondence with [[Jesuits]] in [[Beijing|Peking]].

After his death in [[Saint Petersburg]] his widow handed over his books and papers to the Academy authorities, receiving the rest of her husband's pay due that year.&lt;ref&gt;Lundbaek, Knud ''T. S. Bayer(1694-1738) Pioneer Sinologist'' London 1986  p.209 {{ISBN|0700701893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library was later sold to a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[pastor]] in [[London]], Heinrich Walter Gerdes.  William Hunter later purchased the collection from Gerdes' widow.  It finally reached the [[University of Glasgow]] in 1807 with a brief stay in [[London]] with Dr Matthew Baillie, Hunter's nephew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/specialcollections/collectionsa-z/bayercollection/ |title= Bayer Collection |work= gla.ac.uk |publisher= University of Glasgow|accessdate= January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/manuscripts/search/detaila.cfm?AID=2523.0 |title= GB 0247 MS Hunter B - Collection |work= special.lib.gla.ac.uk |publisher= University of Glasgow|accessdate= January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25149">'''Transparency''', as used in [[science]], [[engineering]], [[business]], the [[humanities]] and in other [[Social actions|social]] contexts, is operating in such a way that it is easy for others to see what actions are performed. It has been defined simply as "the perceived quality of intentionally shared information from a sender".&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; Transparency implies [[openness]], communication, and [[accountability]].

Transparency is practiced in companies, organizations, administrations, and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening government: A guide to best practice in transparency, accountability and civic engagement across the public sector|url=http://www.transparency-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Opening-Government3.pdf|website=Transparency Initiative|publisher=Transparency &amp; Accountability Initiative|accessdate=September 11, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218030712/http://www.transparency-initiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Opening-Government3.pdf|archivedate=February 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It guides an organization's decisions and policies on the disclosure of information to its employees and the public, or simply the intended recipient of the information.&lt;ref name='JOM'&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schnackenberg | first1 = Andrew K. | last2 = Tomlinson | first2 = Edward C. | title = Organizational transparency: a new perspective on managing trust in organization-stakeholder relationships | journal = [[Journal of Management]] | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0149206314525202 | date = March 2014 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0149206314525202 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} Published online before print.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a cashier making change after a point of sale transaction by offering a record of the items purchased (e.g., a receipt) as well as counting out the customer's change on the counter demonstrates one type of transparency.

The term '''transparency''' has a very different meaning in Information Security where it is used to describe security mechanisms that are intentionally in-detectable or hidden from view.  Examples include hiding utilities and tools which the user does not need to know in order to do their job, like keeping the remote re-authentication operations of Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol hidden from the user. 

==Wages==
In Norway and in Sweden, tax authorities annually release the "skatteliste" or "tax list"; official records showing the annual income and overall wealth of nearly every taxpayer.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite news |authorlink = |title = Norway Divided by Citizen Wealth Tables|date = October 23, 2009|publisher = |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/24/business/global/24tax.html?_r=2&amp;ref=global|work = The New York Times|pages = |accessdate = 22 November 2009|language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations in Hong Kong require banks to list their top earners – without naming them – by pay band.&lt;ref name='retreat'&gt;{{cite news | first=Jill | last=Treanor |authorlink= | title=Government retreats over naming bank top earners - Top 20 highest paid employees now unlikely to be identified unless they have boardroom roles | date=22 November 2009 | publisher= | url =https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/nov/22/banks-top-20-earners | work = [[The Guardian]] | pages = | accessdate = 22 November 2009  | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Spanish government for the first time released information on how much each cabinet member is worth, but data on ordinary citizens is private.

==Management==
[[File:Shimer College dialogue transparency 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Shimer College]] students demonstrate in favor of transparency in school administration, 2010]]
Recent research suggests there are three primary aspects of transparency relevant to management practice: information disclosure, clarity, and accuracy.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt; To increase transparency, managers actively infuse greater disclosure, clarity, and accuracy into their communications with [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]]. For example, managers that voluntarily share information related to the firm's ecological impact with environmental activists are demonstrating disclosure; managers that limit the use of [[technical terminology]], [[fine print]], or complicated mathematical notations in their correspondence with suppliers and customers are demonstrating clarity; and managers that do not bias, embellish, or otherwise distort known facts in their communications with investors are demonstrating accuracy. The ''strategic'' management of transparency therefore involves intentional modifications in disclosure, clarity, and accuracy to accomplish the organization's specific objectives.&lt;ref name='JOM'/&gt;

Alternatively, [[radical transparency]] is a [[management]] method where nearly all decision making is carried out publicly. All draft documents, all arguments for and against a proposal, all final decisions, and the decision making process itself are made public and remain publicly archived. This approach has grown in popularity with the rise of the [[Internet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Marcia W. | last1= DiStaso | first2= Denise Sevick | last2= Bortree | title= Ethical practice of social media in public relations | page= 23 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 9781317917908 | year= 2014 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=MujpAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of organizations utilizing this style are the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community and [[Indymedia]].

[[Corporate transparency]], a form of [[radical transparency]], is the concept of removing all barriers to —and the facilitating of— free and easy public access to corporate information and the laws, rules, social [[connivance]] and processes that facilitate and protect those individuals and corporations that freely join, develop, and improve the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= Bernardi | first1= Richard A. |last2= LaCross |first2= Catherine C. | title= Corporate transparency: code of ethics disclosures | url= http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/405/essentials/p34.htm | work= The CPA Journal | publisher= New York State Society of the Certified Public Accountants (CPA) | date= April 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-governmental organizations===
Accountability and transparency are of high relevance for [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs). In view of their responsibilities to stakeholders, including donors, sponsors, programme beneficiaries, staff, states and the public, they are considered to be of even greater importance to them than to commercial undertakings.&lt;ref name="huidobro-p60"&gt;{{Cite book | first1= Maria | last1= Francesch-Huidobro | title= Governance, politics and the environment: a Singapore study | page= 60 | publisher = Institute of Southeast Asian Studies (ISEAS) | isbn = 9789812308313 | year= 2008 }} [https://books.google.com/books?id=QrCqBmdZY5UC&amp;pg=PA60 Preview.]&lt;/ref&gt; Yet these same values are often found to be lacking in NGOs.&lt;ref name="huidobro-p60"/&gt;

The ''[[INGO Accountability Charter|International NGO Accountability Charter]]'', linked to the [[Global Reporting Initiative]], documents the commitment of its members [[international NGO]]s to accountability and transparency, requiring them to submit an annual report, among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Is GRI too much transparency for NGOs? | url = http://prizmablog.com/2011/03/27/is-gri-too-much-transparency-porn-for-ngos/ | publisher = PRIZMA | date = March 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Our accountability commitments: transparency | url = http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/home/our-accountability-commitments/transparency/ | publisher = INGO accountability charter | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150329081613/http://www.ingoaccountabilitycharter.org/home/our-accountability-commitments/transparency/ | archivedate = 2015-03-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signed in 2006 by 11 NGOs active in the area of humanitarian rights, the INGO Accountability Charter has been referred to as the “first global accountability charter for the non-profit sector”.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Thompson | first = Andrew S. | contribution = Laying the groundwork: Considerations for a charter for a proposed global civi society forum | editor-last1 = Walker | editor-first1 = James W.

==Media==
{{Main|Media transparency}}
[[Media transparency]] is the concept of determining how and why [[information]] is conveyed through various means.

If the media and the public knows everything that happens in all authorities and county administrations there will be a lot of questions, protests and suggestions coming from media and the public. People who are interested in a certain issue will try to influence the decisions. Transparency creates an everyday participation in the political processes by media and the public. One tool used to increase everyday participation in political processes is [[freedom of information]] legislation and requests. Modern [[democracy]] builds on such participation of the people and media.

There are, for anybody who is interested, many ways to influence the decisions at all levels in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= Moeller | first1= Susan D. | title= Openness &amp; accountability: a study of transparency in global media outlets | url= http://www.icmpa.umd.edu/pages/studies/transparency/main.html | work= Studies | publisher= International Center for Media and the Public Agenda (ICMPA) | display-authors= etal | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080515174519/http://www.icmpa.umd.edu/pages/studies/transparency/main.html | archivedate= 2008-05-15 | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Seal of Good Housekeeping plaque Santa Barbara Pangasinan.jpg|thumb|A 2011 [[Commemorative plaque|plaque]] recognizing the municipality of [[Santa Barbara, Pangasinan]] for its "efforts in advancing the principles of [[accountability]] and transparency in [[local governance]]." ]]
The right and the means to examine the process of decision making is known as transparency.
In politics, transparency is used as a means of holding [[official|public officials]] [[accountability|accountable]] and fighting [[political corruption|corruption]]. When a [[government]]'s meetings are open to the [[Mass media|press]] and the public, its [[budgets]] may be reviewed by anyone, and its laws and decisions are open to discussion, it is seen as transparent. It is not clear however if this provides less opportunity for the authorities to abuse the system for their own interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Mattozzi | first1= Andrea | last2 = Merlo | first2 = Antonio | title = The transparency of politics and the quality of politicians | journal = [[American Economic Review]] | volume = 97 | issue = 2 | pages = 311–315 | publisher = [[American Economic Association]] | doi = 10.1257/aer.97.2.311 | date = May 2007 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.97.2.311 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [http://people.hss.caltech.edu/~andrea/transparency.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

When military authorities [[classified information|classify]] their plans as secret, transparency is absent. This can be seen as either positive or negative; positive because it can increase [[national security]], negative because it can lead to corruption and, in extreme cases, a [[military dictatorship]].

While a [[liberal democracy]] can be a [[plutocracy]], where decisions are made behind locked doors and the people have fewer possibilities to influence politics between the elections, a [[participative democracy]] is more closely connected to the will of the people.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} Participative democracy, built on transparency and everyday participation, has been used officially in northern [[Europe]] for decades. In the northern European [[country]] [[Sweden]], [[Constitution of Sweden#Public access to governmental documents|public access to government documents]] became a law as early as 1766. It has officially been adopted as an ideal to strive for by the rest of EU, leading to measures like [[Freedom of information laws by country|freedom of information laws]] and [[Lobby register|laws for lobby transparency]].

To promote transparency in [[politics]], [[Hans Peter Martin]], [[Paul van Buitenen]] ([[Europa Transparant]]) and [[Ashley Mote]] decided to cooperate under the name [[Platform for Transparency]] (PfT) in 2005. Similar organizations that promotes transparency are [[Transparency International]] and the [[Sunlight Foundation]].

A recent political movement to emerge in conjunction with the demands for transparency is the [[Pirate Party]], a label for a number of political parties across different countries who advocate freedom of information, direct democracy, network neutrality, and the free sharing of knowledge.

==Online culture==

21st century culture affords a higher level of public transparency than ever before, and actually requires it in many cases.  Modern technology and associated culture shifts have changed how government works (see [[WikiLeaks]]), what information people can find out about each other, and the ability of politicians to stay in office if they are involved in [[sex scandals]]. Due to the [[digital revolution]], people no longer have a high level of control over what is public information, leading to a tension between the values of transparency and [[privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Digital person: technology and privacy in the information age|page=140 |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0814798462|isbn=0814798462 |first=Daniel J. |last=Solove|year= 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==

[[research|Scholarly research]] in any [[scientific method|academic discipline]] may also be labeled as (partly) transparent (or [[open research]]) if some or all relevant aspects of the research are open in the sense of [[open source]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Rocchini | first1 = Duccio | last2 = Neteler | first2 = Markus | title = Let the four freedoms paradigm apply to ecology | journal = [[Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution]] | volume = 27 | issue = 6 | pages = 310–311 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.009 | date = June 2012 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tree.2012.03.009 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open data]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/engl_start.htm|title=Wissenschaftsrat: Home|work=wissenschaftsrat.de|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417091550/http://www.wissenschaftsrat.de/engl_start.htm|archivedate=2010-04-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby facilitating [[Recognition (sociology)|social recognition]] and [[accountability]] of the scholars who did the research and [[Reproducibility|replication]] by others interested in the matters addressed by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/embor/journal/v3/n1/full/embor241.html|title=Transparent science| volume=3|doi=10.1093/embo-reports/kvf018|pages=9–11|journal=EMBO Reports|pmc=1083937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[mathematicians]] and scientists are critical of using closed source [[mathematical software]] such as [[Mathematica]] for [[mathematical proofs]], because these do not provide transparency, and thus are not verifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everything2.com/title/Mathematica+and+free+software|title=Mathematica and free software|work=everything2.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open-source software such as [[SageMath]] aims to solve this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news116173009.html|title=Free software brings affordability, transparency to mathematics|publisher=physorg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

In the computer software world, [[open source software]] concerns the creation of software, to which access to the underlying [[source code]] is freely available. This permits use, study, and modification without restriction.

In computer security, the debate is ongoing as to the relative merits of the [[Full disclosure (computer security)|full disclosure]] of security vulnerabilities, versus a [[Security through obscurity|security-by-obscurity]] approach.

There is a different (perhaps almost opposite) sense of [[Transparency (human–computer interaction)|transparency in human-computer interaction]], whereby a system after change adheres to its previous external interface as much as possible while changing its internal behaviour. That is, a change in a system is transparent to its users if the change is unnoticeable to them.

==Sports==

[[Sports]] has become a global business over the last century, and here, too, initiatives ranging from mandatory drug testing to the fighting of sports-related corruption are gaining ground based on the transparent activities in other domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transparencyinsport.org/|title=Transparency in Sport|work=transparencyinsport.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}}

==Criticism==

[[Sigmund Freud]] following [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] ("On Truth and Lie in a Nonmoral Sense") regularly argues that transparency is impossible because of the occluding function of the unconscious.

Among philosophical and literary works that have examined the idea of transparency are [[Michel Foucault]]'s ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' or [[David Brin]]'s ''[[The Transparent Society]]''. 
The German philosopher and media theorist [[Byung-Chul Han]] in his 2012 work ''Transparenzgesellschaft'' sees transparency as a cultural norm created by neoliberal market forces, which he understands as the insatiable drive toward voluntary disclosure bordering on the pornographic. According to Han, the dictates of transparency enforce a totalitarian system of openness at the expense of other social values such as shame, secrecy, and trust. He was criticized for his concepts, as they would suggest corrupt politics and for referring to the anti-democratic Carl Schmitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Klarheit schaffen|url=http://www.freitag.de/kultur/1223-klarheit-schaffen|work=der Freitag | language = German |date=7 June 2012 |accessdate= 3 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists have long explored ethnographically the relation between revealed and concealed knowledges, and have increasingly taken up the topic in relation to accountability, transparency and conspiracy theories and practices today.&lt;ref&gt;Strathern, M. 2000. Audit Cultures: Anthropological Studies in Accountability, Ethics and the Academy. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hetherington, K. 2011. Guerrilla Auditors: The Politics of Transparency in Neoliberal Paraguay.

West 2003. Powers revealed and concealed in the New World Order. In H. G. West &amp; T. Sanders (eds) Transparency and Conspiracy: Ethnographies of Suspicion in the New World Order.

[https://web.archive.org/web/20131111183729/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/aboutkings/worldwide/initiatives/global/nas/people/Academics/birchall/index.aspx Clare Birchall], Christina Gaarsten, Mikkel Flyverbom, and Mark Fenster among others, write in the vein of 'Critical Transparency Studies' which attempts to challenge particular orthodoxies concerning transparency. 
Birchall, assessed in an article "[...] whether the ascendance of transparency as an ideal limits political thinking, particularly for western socialists and radicals struggling to seize opportunities for change [...]". She argues that the promotion of 'datapreneurial' activity through open data initiatives outsources and interrupts the political contract between governed and government. She is concerned that the dominant model of governmental data-driven transparency produces neoliberal subjectivities that reduce the possibility of politics as an arena of dissent between real alternatives. She suggests that the radical Left might want to work with and reinvent secrecy as an alternative to neoliberal transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Birchall | first = Clare | title = Transparency interrupted: secrets of the left | journal = [[Theory, Culture &amp; Society]] | volume = 28 | issue = 7–8 | pages = 60–84 | publisher = [[Sage Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0263276411423040 | date = December 2011 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0263276411423040 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers at [[University of Oxford]] and [[Warwick Business School]] found that transparency can also have significant unintended consequences in the field of medical care. McGivern&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://warwick.academia.edu/GerryMcGivern|title=Gerry  McGivern - University of Warwick - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Fischer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer|title=Michael D Fischer - Australian Catholic University - Academia.edu|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; found 'media spectacles' and transparent regulation combined to create 'spectacular transparency' which some perverse effects on doctors' practice and increased defensive behaviour in doctors and their staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry |last2=Fischer|first2=Michael D. |title=Medical regulation, spectacular transparency and the blame business|journal=Journal of Health, Organization and Management |year=2010|volume=24|issue=6|pages=597–610 |pmid=21155435 |doi=10.1108/14777261011088683}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGivern|first=Gerry |last2=Fischer|first2=Michael D. |title=Reactivity and reactions to regulatory transparency in medicine, psychotherapy and counselling|journal=[[Social Science &amp; Medicine]]|date=1 February 2012|volume=74|issue=3|pages=289–296 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035 |doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2011.09.035|pmid=22104085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in a four-year organizational study, [https://oxford.academia.edu/MichaelFischer Fischer] and [https://kcl.academia.edu/EwanFerlie Ferlie] found that transparency in the context of a clinical risk management can act perversely to undermine ethical behavior, leading to organizational crisis and even collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Michael D. | last2 = Ferlie | first2 = Ewan |title=Resisting hybridization between modes of clinical risk management: Contradiction, contest, and the production of intractable conflict|journal=[[Accounting, Organizations and Society]] |date=1 January 2013|volume=38|issue=1|pages=30–49 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002 |doi=10.1016/j.aos.2012.11.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''UC Berkeley College of Chemistry''' is one of 14 schools and colleges at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. It houses the departments of [[Chemistry]], [[Chemical engineering|Chemical Engineering]], and [[Chemical Biology]] and occupies six buildings flanking a central plaza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chem.berkeley.edu/ UC Berkeley, Department of Chemistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cheme.berkeley.edu/ UC Berkeley, Dept of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[US News and World Report]] has ranked its chemistry and chemical engineering programs first and second in the U.S., respectively, while the 2014 QS World University Rankings has ranked both its chemistry and chemical engineering programs second best in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2014/engineering-chemical#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search= QS World University Rankings by Subject 2014 - Engineering - Chemical | Top Universities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Its faculty and graduates have won numerous awards, including the [[Wolf Prize]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[National Medal of Technology]], the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]], as well as thirteen [[Nobel Prizes]].&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; {{As of|2012}}-13, it has 815 undergraduates, 526 graduate students, and 187 postdoctoral fellows.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; 

The Department of Chemistry is one of the largest and most productive in the world, graduating about 80 doctoral students per year&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; while maintaining the world's highest citation-per-faculty score.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} It hosts 6 of the top 100 chemists worldwide by citation impact for 2000–2010, tied with [[MIT]] for the most of any institution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencewatch.com/dr/sci/misc/Top100Chemists2000-10/ Top 100 Chemists, 2000-2010 - ScienceWatch.com - Thomson Reuters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists affiliated with the department and the nearby [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] are responsible for the discovery of sixteen elements, including [[berkelium]], named after the city, and [[seaborgium]], named after Nobel laureate and former department chair [[Glenn Seaborg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/new-elements-here.html Chemical Elements Discovered at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

First established in 1872, the college awarded its first Ph.D. in 1885 to [[John Maxson Stillman|John Stillman]], who later founded the chemistry department at [[Stanford University]]. A Division of Chemical Engineering was established in 1946, becoming a department in 1957. The Department of Chemical Engineering changed its name to Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering in 2010 to reflect the research focus of its faculty in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cheme.berkeley.edu/grad_info/note_from_the_chair.php UC Berkeley, Dept of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering - Graduate Program Info - Note from Chair&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Students==
The College offers three undergraduate degrees: chemical engineering, chemistry, and chemical biology.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt; Chemistry undergrads in the College of Chemistry also have the option to earn a B.A. in chemistry from the [[UC Berkeley College of Letters and Science|College of Letters and Science]], or to specialize in a materials chemistry concentration. Two double major programs with the [[UC Berkeley College of Engineering|College of Engineering]] exist: chemical engineering and materials science and engineering, and chemical engineering and nuclear engineering.

Popular undergraduate courses such as Chem 4A (general chemistry) and Chem 12A (organic chemistry) are taught by College of Chemistry faculty.

Graduate programs include the M.S. and Ph.D. in chemical engineering and Ph.D. in chemistry.&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

==Faculty==
As of 2015, the faculty at the College includes 10 members of the [[National Academy of Engineering]], 28 members of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], and 33 members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. 3 members of the faculty have been awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].&lt;ref name="facts" /&gt;

==Campus==
The College of Chemistry is located on the east side of the UC Berkeley campus. It includes [[Gilman Hall]], a National Historic Landmark, where plutonium was first identified in 1941. Pimentel Hall is one of the largest lecture halls on campus, and features a revolving stage to allow for setup of chemistry demos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkeley.edu/map/googlemap/|title=Google map - UC Berkeley|last=University of California, Berkeley|accessdate=25 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The buildings of the College are linked by a network of underground hallways and laboratories.
