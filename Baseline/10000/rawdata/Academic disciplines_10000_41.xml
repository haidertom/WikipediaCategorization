'''Aviation accident analysis''' is performed to determine the cause of errors once an accident has happened. In the modern aviation industry, it is also used to analyze a database of past accidents in order to prevent an accident from happening. Many models have been used not only for the accident investigation but also for educational purpose.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Human factors ==
In the aviation industry, human error is the major cause of accidents. About 38% of 329 major airline crashes, 74% of 1627 commuter/air taxi crashes, and 85% of 27935 [[general aviation]] crashes were related to pilot error.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guohua_Li3/publication/12136068_Factors_associated_with_pilot_error_in_aviation_crashes/links/5407268b0cf2c48563b29739.pdf|title = Factors associated with pilot error in aviation crashes|last = Li|first = Guohua|date = Feb 2001|journal = Research Gate|doi = |pmid = |access-date = Oct 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Swiss cheese model]] is an accident causation model which analyzes the accident more from the human factor aspect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = Systems-based analysis methods: a comparison of AcciMap, HFACS, and STAMP|last = P.M|first = Salmon|date = 2012|journal = Safety Science|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Systems thinking, the Swiss Cheese Model and accident analysis: A comparative systemic analysis of the Grayrigg train derailment using the ATSB, AcciMap and STAMP models|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457513002959|journal = Accident Analysis &amp; Prevention|date = 2014-07-01|pages = 75–94|volume = 68|series = Systems thinking in workplace safety and health|doi = 10.1016/j.aap.2013.07.027|first = Peter|last = Underwood|first2 = Patrick|last2 = Waterson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reason's model ===
[[File:Swiss cheese model of accident causation.png|thumb|Reason's model]]
Reason's model, commonly referred to as the Swiss cheese model, was based on Reason's approach that all organizations should work together to ensure a safe and efficient operation.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|url = https://dvikan.no/ntnu-studentserver/reports/A%20Human%20Error%20Approach%20to%20Aviation%20Accident%20Analysis.pdf|title = A Human Error Approach to Aviation Accident Analysis: The Human Factors Analysis and Classification System|last = Wiegmann|first = Douglas A|date = 2003|journal = Ashgate Publishing Limited|doi = |pmid = |access-date = Oct 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the pilot's perspective, in order to maintain a safe flight operation, all human and mechanical elements must co-operate effectively in the system. In Reason's model, the holes represent weakness or failure. These holes will not lead to accident directly, because of the existence of defense layers. However, once all the holes line up, an accident will occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Accident models and organisational factors in air transport: The need for multi-method models|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925753510000366|journal = Safety Science|date = 2011-01-01|pages = 5–10|volume = 49|series = The gift of failure: New approaches to analyzing and learning from events and near-misses – Honoring the contributions of Bernhard Wilpert|issue = 1|doi = 10.1016/j.ssci.2010.01.022|first = A. L. C.|last = Roelen|first2 = P. H.|last2 = Lin|first3 = A. R.|last3 = Hale}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are four layers in this model: organizational influences, unsafe supervision, precondition and unsafe acts.
* '''Organizational influences''': This layer is about resources management, organizational climate and organizational process. For example, a crew underestimating the cost of maintenance will leave the airplane and equipment in bad condition.
* '''Unsafe supervision''': This layer includes inadequate supervision, inappropriate operations, failure to correct a problem and supervisory violation. For example, if emergency procedure training is not provided to a new employee, it will increase the potential risk of a fatal accident.
*'''Unsafe action''': Unsafe action is not the direct cause of accident. There are some preconditions that lead to unsafe actions; unstable mental state is one of the reasons for bad decisions.
*'''Error and violation''': These are part of unsafe action. Error refers to an individual unable to perform a correct action to achieve an outcome. Violation involves the action of breaking a rule or regulation. All these four layers form the basic component of the Swiss cheese model and accident analysis can be performed by tracing all these factors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = |title = A Review of Accident Modelling Approaches for Complex Critical Sociotechnical Systems|last = Qureshi|first = Zahid H|date = Jan 2008|journal = Defense Science and Technology Organisation|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mearns|first1=Kathryn J.|last2=Flin|first2=Rhona|title=Assessing the state of organizational safety—culture or climate?|journal=Current Psychology|date=March 1999|volume=18|issue=1|pages=5–17|doi=10.1007/s12144-999-1013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Investigation using Reason's model ===
Based on Reason's model, accident investigators analyze the accident from all four layers to determine the cause of the accident. There are two main types of failure investigators will focus on: active failure and latent failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nielsen|first1=K.J.|last2=Rasmussen|first2=K.|last3=Glasscock|first3=D.|last4=Spangenberg|first4=S.|title=Changes in safety climate and accidents at two identical manufacturing plants|journal=Safety Science|date=March 2008|volume=46|issue=3|pages=440–449|doi=10.1016/j.ssci.2007.05.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Active failure''' is an unsafe act conducted by an individual that directly leads to accident. Investigators will identify [[pilot error]] first. Misconducting of emergency procedure, misunderstanding of instructions, failing to put proper flaps on landing, and ignoring in-flight warning system are few examples of active failure. The difference between active failure and latent failure is that the effect caused by active failure will show up immediately.
* '''Latent failure''' usually occurs from the high level management. Investigators may ignore this kind of failure because it may remain undetected for a long time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Human error: models and management|journal = BMJ : British Medical Journal|date = 2000-03-18|issn = 0959-8138|pmc = 1117770|pmid = 10720363|pages = 768–770|volume = 320|issue = 7237|first = James|last = Reason|doi=10.1136/bmj.320.7237.768}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the investigation of latent failure, investigators have three levels to assess. The first is the factor that directly affects the operator's behavior: precondition (fatigue and illness). On February 12, 2009, a Colgan Air Bombardier DHC-8-400 was on approach to Buffalo-Niagara International Airport. The pilots were experiencing fatigue and their inattentiveness cost the lives of everyone on board and one person on the ground when it crashed near the airport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Aviation Accident Report AAR-10-01|url = http://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Pages/AAR1001.aspx|website = www.ntsb.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation suggested that both pilots were tired and their conversation was not related to the flight operation, which indirectly caused the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = A double tragedy: Colgan Air Flight 3407 – Air Facts Journal|url = http://airfactsjournal.com/2014/03/double-tragedy-colgan-air-flight-3407/|website = Air Facts Journal|accessdate = 2015-10-26|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Crew Schedules, Sleep Deprivation, and Aviation Performance|url = http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/21/2/85|journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science|date = 2012-04-01|issn = 0963-7214|pages = 85–89|volume = 21|issue = 2|doi = 10.1177/0963721411435842|first = John A.|last = Caldwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second level investigator will track precursors of accidents related to latent threats. On June 1, 2009, Air France 447 crashed into the Atlantic Ocean and 228 passengers on broad were killed. Analysis of the black box indicated that the airplane was controlled by an inexperienced co-pilot who lifted the nose too high and induced a [[compressor stall|stall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Lessons from the past: Inaccurate credibility assessments made during crisis situations|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6699098|journal = 2013 IEEE International Conference on Technologies for Homeland Security (HST)|date = 2013-11-01|pages = 754–759|doi = 10.1109/THS.2013.6699098|first = L.C.|last = Landrigan|first2 = J.P.|last2 = Wade|first3 = A.|last3 = Milewski|first4 = B.|last4 = Reagor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Letting an inexperienced pilot fly the airplane by himself is one of the cases of unsafe supervision. The last area that latent failure investigation will assess is organizational failure. For example, an airline company decides to reduce the cost spent on pilot training. Those who lack of training will directly lead to the existence of inexperienced pilots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haddad|first1=Ziad S.|last2=Park|first2=Kyung-Won|title=Vertical profiling of tropical precipitation using passive microwave observations and its implications regarding the crash of Air France 447|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research|date=23 June 2010|volume=115|issue=D12|doi=10.1029/2009JD013380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=REASON|first1=JAMES|title=A systems approach to organizational error|journal=Ergonomics|date=August 1995|volume=38|issue=8|pages=1708–1721|doi=10.1080/00140139508925221}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In order to fully understand the cause of the accident all those steps need to be performed. Investigation that is different from the causing of the accident, then it is necessary to investigate from backward of Reason's model.

'''Blood sugar regulation''' is the process by which the levels of [[blood sugar]], primarily [[glucose]], are maintained by the body within a narrow range. This tight regulation is referred to as '''glucose homeostasis'''. [[Insulin]], which lowers blood sugar,  and [[glucagon]], which raises it,  are the most well known of the hormones involved, but more recent discoveries of other glucoregulatory hormones have expanded the understanding of this process.&lt;ref name=Aronoff&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aronoff SL, Berkowitz K, Shreiner B, Want L | title = Glucose metabolism and regulation: Beyond insulin and glucagon | journal = Diabetes Spectrum | volume = 17 | issue = 3 | pages = 183–90 | year = 2004 | pmid =  | doi = 10.2337/diaspect.17.3.183 | url = http://spectrum.diabetesjournals.org/content/17/3/183.abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms==
[[File:Negative Feedback Gif.gif|thumb|The flat line is the optimal blood sugar level (i.e. the homeostatic set point). Blood sugar levels are balanced by the tug-of-war between 2 functionally opposite hormones, glucagon and insulin.]]
Blood sugar levels are regulated by [[negative feedback]] in order to keep the body in [[homeostasis|balance]]. The levels of [[glucose]] in the blood are monitored by many tissues, but the cells in the [[pancreatic islets]] are among the most well understood and important.

===Glucagon===
If the blood glucose level falls to dangerous levels (as during very heavy exercise or lack of food for extended periods), the [[alpha cells]] of the pancreas release [[glucagon]], a [[hormone]] whose effects on liver cells act to increase blood glucose levels. They convert [[glycogen]] into glucose (this process is called [[glycogenolysis]]).  The glucose is released into the bloodstream, increasing blood sugar. [[Hypoglycemia]], the state of having low blood sugar, is treated by restoring the blood glucose level to normal by the ingestion or administration of [[dextrose]] or [[carbohydrate]] foods. It is often self-diagnosed and self-medicated orally by the ingestion of balanced meals. In more severe circumstances, it is treated by injection or infusion of glucagon.

===Insulin===

When levels of blood sugar rise, whether as a result of [[glycogen]] conversion, or from digestion of a meal, a different hormone is released from [[beta cells]] found in the [[Islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas. This hormone, [[insulin]], causes the liver to convert more glucose into glycogen (this process is called [[glycogenesis]]), and to force about 2/3 of body cells (primarily [[muscle]] and fat tissue cells) to take up glucose from the blood through the [[GLUT4]] transporter, thus decreasing blood sugar. When insulin binds to the receptors on the cell surface, vesicles containing the GLUT4 transporters come to the plasma membrane and fuse together by the process of endocytosis, thus enabling a facilitated diffusion of glucose into the cell. As soon as the glucose enters the cell, it is phosphorylated into Glucose-6-Phosphate in order to preserve the concentration gradient so glucose will continue to enter the cell.&lt;ref&gt;Ebey Soman, [[Scienceray]], [http://scienceray.com/biology/human-biology/regulation-of-glucose-by-insulin Regulation of Glucose by Insulin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716022545/http://scienceray.com/biology/human-biology/regulation-of-glucose-by-insulin |date=July 16, 2011 }}, May 4, 2009. Retrieved November 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Insulin also provides signals to several other body systems, and is the chief regulator of metabolic control in humans.

There are also several other causes for an increase in blood sugar levels. Among them are the 'stress' hormones such as [[epinephrine]] (also known as adrenaline), several of the steroids, infections, trauma, and of course, the ingestion of food.

[[Diabetes mellitus]] type 1 is caused by insufficient or non-existent production of insulin, while type 2 is primarily due to a decreased response to insulin in the tissues of the body ([[insulin resistance]]). Both types of diabetes, if untreated, result in too much glucose remaining in the blood ([[hyperglycemia]]) and many of the same complications.  Also, too much insulin and/or exercise without enough corresponding food intake in diabetics can result in low blood sugar ([[hypoglycemia]]).

[[File:FEMA - 578 - Photograph by Ty Harrington taken on 10-07-2000 in Florida.jpg|thumb|Many US radio talk shows use broadcast delay to avoid FCC penalties]]
In [[radio]] and [[television]], '''broadcast delay''' is an intentional delay when [[broadcasting]] [[broadcasting#recorded or live|live]] material. Such a delay may be short (often seven seconds) to prevent mistakes or unacceptable content from being broadcast. Longer delays lasting several hours can also be introduced so that the material is aired at a later scheduled time (such as the [[prime time]] hours) to maximize viewership.

==Usage==
A short delay is often used to prevent [[profanity]], [[bloopers]], [[nudity]], or other undesirable material from making it to air, including more mundane problems such as technical malfunctions (an anchor's lapel microphone goes dead). In that instance, it is often referred to as a 'seven-second delay' or 'profanity delay'. Longer delays, however, may also be introduced, often to allow a show to air at the same time for the local market as is sometimes done with nationally-broadcast programs in countries with multiple [[time zones]]. Considered as [[time shifting]], that is often achieved by a "tape delay," using a [[video tape recorder]], modern [[digital video recorders]], or other similar technology. 

Tape delay may also refer to the process of broadcasting an event at a later scheduled time because a scheduling conflict prevents a live telecast, or a broadcaster seeks to maximize ratings by airing an event in a certain timeslot. That can also be done because of time constraints of certain portions, usually those that do not affect the outcome of the show, are edited out or the availability of hosts or other key production staff only at certain times of the day, and it is generally applicable for [[cable television]] programs. 

Broadcasters in the [[United States]] regularly utilize a "west-coast delay" in which special events (including some award shows and several reality competition programs) broadcast live in the [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern]] or [[Central Time Zone|Central]] Time Zones are then tape-delayed on the [[West Coast of the United States|western]] half of the country, including [[California]]. That is done although Southern California is the place that many live televised events take place. The three-hour time difference, for example, makes a live event scheduled at 8:00 pm in New York also be at 5:00 pm in Los Angeles, when many people there are just getting out of work, instead of being at home and watching TV. American morning news shows are typically aired live only in the Eastern Time Zone and on tape delay in the remaining time zones, except for special editions and significant breaking news headlines requiring live nationwide U.S. telecasts. That allows post-production staff to edit out any glitches that occurred during the live broadcast.

International tape delays of live global events, intended by major television networks, dominated world television until the early 2010s. For example, during the [[Sydney Olympics]] in 2000, daytime events were occurring at early morning hours in the Americas, Africa, and Europe but were aired live entirely in Asia, Australia, and Oceania. That made some broadcasters show high-profile events twice (live and then rebroadcast during prime time), but others withheld the same event to be broadcast solely during prime time. Often, tape-delaying of those events would mean editing them down for time considerations, highlighting what the broadcaster feels are the most interesting portions of the event, or advertising.

With the advent of [[social media and television|social media]]'s widespread reach to television viewers by the late 2000s, however, tape delays for several television programs have steadily declined because of [[live television]]'s resurgence as a broadcast format. From the mid-2010s, several [[event television|high-profile entertainment]] programs like the [[Academy Awards]], [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] and [[Grammy Awards]], as well as [[Olympic Games]], the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], the [[National Football League]]'s [[Super Bowl]] and other major international sports telecasts, have been aired to totality live on both television and the internet in virtually all of the world's time zones in and out of their countries of origin, with mandated prime time rebroadcasts (inclusive of edits as desired by broadcasters) for regions which have previously and solely relied on delayed telecasts on prime time among these otherwise live events.

==History==
The [[radio station]] [[WSAN|WKAP]] in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], introduced a tape delay system consisting of an external playback head, which was spaced far enough away from the record head to allow for a six-second delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2006-09-20/opinion/3679033_1_format-dopey-duncan-radio-station |title=In local radio, change is common - with one exception |publisher=The Morning Call |first1=Wally |last1=Elly |date=2006-09-20 |accessdate=2016-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A system of rollers guided the tape over the playback head before it wound up on the take up reel. This system was introduced in 1952 when WKAP started a talk show called ''Open Mic''. It is believed that this was the first time a telephone call-in show was broadcast with the telephone conversation "live" on the air. The FCC rules at the time prohibited the broadcasting of a live phone conversation. However, there was no rule prohibiting a taped playback of a phone call, provided that a "beep" tone was heard by the caller every 15 seconds so that the caller knew he was being recorded. The six-second delay constituted a "taped" phone conversation, thus complying with FCC regulations, that being a [[legal fiction]].

The broadcast profanity delay was invented by C. Frank Cordaro (July 13, 1919 - February 20, 1997) who was Chief Engineer of WKAP, originally on AM 1320, in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], during the 1950s and early 1960s. Ogden Davies, then General Manager of WKAP, assigned Cordaro the task to develop a device whereby profanity during a "live" conversation could be deleted by the radio talk show host before it was broadcast. This new device was to be used on the ''Open Mic'' radio talk show. The device Cordaro developed was the first tape delay system. WKAP was one of several stations owned by the Rahal brothers of West Virginia (later Rahal Communications). First tested and used at WKAP, this tape system for broadcast profanity delay was then installed at the other Rahal-owned radio stations. From the Rahal brothers' stations, the broadcast profanity delay went into common usage throughout the US.

[[John Nebel]], who began a pioneering radio [[talk show]] in [[New York City]] in 1954, was one of the early users of a tape delay system that was invented by his engineer, Russell Tinklepaugh. &lt;ref&gt; Tom Tiede. "Talk-Jockey Jimmy Hits the Air." ''Portsmouth (NH) Times'', March 4, 1977, p. 4. &lt;/ref&gt;  Another announcer who was said to use a tape-delay was talk show pioneer [[Jerry Williams (radio)|Jerry Williams]] at [[WMEX (AM)|WMEX]] in Boston in the late 1950s.

==Computerized delay==
[[File:Eventide BD600 Broadcast Delay.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Eventide BD600 Broadcast Delay]]
In 1977, the capacity of RAM ([[random-access memory]]) had reached 16 kb ([[kilobit]]s) per chip, enough to think about using computerized [[digital audio]] means to create a sufficient delay for content deletion. By storing audio digitally, it was possible to move a "virtual tape head" along recorded audio. [[Eventide, Inc]]. created the first digital broadcast delay for this purpose. The device (known colloquially as a "dump box") had a large "DUMP"/"DELAY DUMP" button that would bring the delay to zero, thus removing unwanted segments. In addition to this convenience, it would also "rebuild" the delay time by unnoticeably lengthening the normal pauses in spoken material. Thus, a minute or so later, the broadcaster would again have full delay, often leaving the listener unaware that material had been deleted.

In modern systems, a profanity delay can be a software module manually operated by a broadcast technician that puts a short delay (usually thirty seconds) into the broadcast of live content. This gives the broadcaster time to [[censorship|censor]] the audio (and video) feed. This can be accomplished by cutting directly to a non-delayed feed, essentially jumping past the undesired moment (something that can be quite jarring to a viewer or listener). In other cases, dedicated hardware units similar to the original digital unit but with improved quality and editing capability can be used. These products can even "build up" delay with difficult program material such as music. Alternatively, a [[bleep censor|bleep noise or other substitute sound]] can be inserted. This is more difficult to do with live content, however, and more often appears on recorded material.

A '''calendar era''' is the '''year numbering''' system used by a [[calendar]]. For example, the [[Gregorian calendar]] numbers its years in the Western [[Christian era]] (the [[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic Orthodox]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Church|Ethiopian Orthodox]] churches have their own Christian eras). The instant, date, or year from which time is marked is called the ''[[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]'' of the era. There are many different calendar eras such as [[Saka Era]].

In antiquity, [[regnal year]]s were counted from the accession of a monarch. This makes the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East]] very difficult to reconstruct, based on disparate and scattered king lists, such as the [[Sumerian King List]] and the Babylonian [[Canon of Kings]]. In East Asia, reckoning by [[era name]]s chosen by ruling monarchs ceased in the 20th century except for [[Japan]], where they are still used.

==Ancient dating systems==

===Assyrian eponyms===
{{main|Eponym dating system}}

For over a thousand years, ancient [[Assyria]] used a system of [[Eponym dating system|eponyms]] to identify each year. Each year at the [[Akitu]] festival (celebrating the Mesopotamian new year), one of a small group of high officials (including the king in later periods) would be chosen by lot to serve as the ''[[limmu]]'' for the year, which meant that he would preside over the Akitu festival and the year would bear his name. The earliest attested ''limmu'' eponyms are from the Assyrian trading colony at [[Kültepe|Karum Kanesh]] in Anatolia, dating to the very beginning of the 2nd millennium BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CDLI: The Old and Middle Assyrian limmu officials|url=http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=list_of_old_assyrian_limmu_officials|website=Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative|accessdate=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they continued in use until the end of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]], ca. 612 BC.

Assyrian scribes compiled ''limmu'' lists, including an unbroken sequence of almost 250 eponyms from the early 1st millennium BC. This is an invaluable chronological aid, because a solar eclipse was recorded as having taken place in the ''limmu'' of Bur-Sagale, governor of [[Tell Halaf|Guzana]]. Astronomers have identified this eclipse as [[Assyrian eclipse|one that took place on 15 June, 763 BC]], which has allowed absolute dates of 892 to 648 BC to be assigned to that sequence of eponyms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Millard|first1=Alan|title=The Eponyms of the Assyrian Empire, 910-612 BC (State Archives of Assyria Studies, Vol. 2)|date=1994|publisher=Neo-Assyrian Text Corpus Project|location=Helsinki|isbn=978-9514567155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This list of absolute dates has allowed many of the events of the Neo-Assyrian Period to be dated to a specific year, avoiding the [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|chronological debates]] that characterize earlier periods of Mesopotamian history.

===Olympiad dating===
Among the ancient Greek historians and scholars, a common method of indicating the passage of years was based on the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], first held in [[776 BC]]. The Olympic Games provided the various independent city-states with a mutually recognizable system of dates. Olympiad dating was not used in everyday life. This system was in use from the 3rd century BC. The modern Olympic Games (or Summer Olympic Games beginning 1896) do not continue the four year periods from ancient Greece: the 669th Olympiad would have begun in the summer of 1897, but the modern Olympics were first held in 1896.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;Blackburn, B. &amp; Holford-Strevens, L. (1999, 2003). ''The Oxford Companion to the Year: an exploration of calendar customs and time-reckoning'' (corrected printing). Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-214231-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|769}}

===Indiction cycles===
Another common system was the [[indiction]] cycle (15 indictions made up an agricultural tax cycle in Roman Egypt, an indiction being a year in duration). Documents and events began to be dated by the year of the cycle (e.g., "fifth indiction", "tenth indiction") in the 4th century, and this system was used long after the tax ceased to be collected. It was used in [[Gaul]], in [[Egypt]], and in most parts of Greece until the [[Islamic conquest of Egypt|Islamic conquest]], and in the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] until its conquest in 1453. 

The rule for computing the indiction from the AD year number, which he had just invented, was stated by [[Dionysius Exiguus]]: add 3 and divide by 15; the remainder is the indiction, with 0 understood to be the fifteenth indiction.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|770}} Thus 2001 was the ninth indiction.&lt;ref&gt;Nautical Almanac Office of the [[United States Naval Observatory]] and [[Her Majesty's Nautical Almanac Office]]. (2000)''[[The Nautical Almanac]] for the year 2001''. [[Washington, DC]]: [[Government Printing Office]] and [[London, England]], UK: [[The Stationery Office]]. p. B4.&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of the year for the indiction varied.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|769–71}}

===Seleucid era===
{{main|Seleucid era}}

The Seleucid era was used in much of the Middle East from the 4th century BC to the 6th century AD, and continued until the 10th century AD among Oriental Christians. The era is computed from the epoch 312 BC: in August of that year [[Seleucus I Nicator]] captured [[Babylon]] and began his reign over the Asian portions of [[Alexander the Great]]'s empire. Thus depending on whether the calendar year is taken as starting on 1 [[Tishri]] or on 1 [[Nisan]] (respectively the start of the Jewish civil and ecclesiastical years) the Seleucid era begins either in 311 BC (the Jewish reckoning) or in 312 BC (the Greek reckoning: October–September).

===Ancient Rome===

====Consular dating====
An early and common practice was Roman '[[Roman consul|consular]]' dating. This involved naming both [[Consul Ordinarius|''consules ordinarii'']] who had taken up this office on January 1 (since 153 BC) of the relevant civil year.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|6}} Sometimes one or both consuls might not be appointed until November or December of the previous year, and news of the appointment may not have reached parts of the Roman empire for several months into the current year; thus we find the occasional inscription where the year is defined as "after the consulate" of a pair of consuls.

The use of consular dating ended in AD 541 when the emperor [[Justinian I]] discontinued appointing consuls. The last consul nominated was [[Anicius Faustus Albinus Basilius]]. Soon afterwards, imperial regnal dating was adopted in its place.

====Dating from the founding of Rome====
Another method of dating, rarely used, was ''[[anno urbis conditae]]'' (Latin: "in the year of the founded city" (abbreviated AUC), where "city" meant Rome). (It is often incorrectly given that AUC stands for ''[[ab urbe condita]]'', which is the title of [[Livy|Titus Livius]]'s history of Rome.)

Several epochs were in use by Roman historians. Modern historians usually adopt the epoch of [[Varro]], which we place in 753 BC.

The system was introduced by [[Marcus Terentius Varro]] in the 1st century BC. The first day of its year was Founder's Day (April 21), although most modern historians assume that it coincides with the modern historical year (January 1 to December 31). It was rarely used in the [[Roman calendar]] and in the early Julian calendar – naming the two [[consul]]s that held office in a particular year was dominant. AD {{CURRENTYEAR}} is thus approximately the same as AUC {{#expr: {{CURRENTYEAR}}+753}} ({{CURRENTYEAR}} + 753).

About AD 400, the Iberian historian [[Paulus Orosius|Orosius]] used the AUC era. Pope [[Boniface IV]] (about AD 600) may have been the first to use both the AUC era and the ''Anno Domini'' era (he put AD 607 = AUC 1360).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007|reason='although it occurs occasionally in papal documents of the time of John XIII (965-972), it was not the rule before the twelfth century': http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/04636c.htm - and that's not even about using abbreviations}}

====Regnal years of Roman emperors====
Another system that is less commonly found than might be thought was the use of the [[regnal year]] of the [[Roman emperor]]. At first, [[Augustus]] indicated the year of his reign by counting how many times he had held the office of consul, and how many times the [[Roman Senate]] had granted him [[Tribune|Tribunican]] powers, carefully observing the fiction that his powers came from these offices granted to him, rather than from his own person or the many [[Roman legion|legion]]s under his control. His successors followed his practice until the memory of the [[Roman Republic]] faded (about AD 200), when they began to use their regnal year openly.

====Dating from the Roman conquest====
Some regions of the [[Roman Empire]] dated their calendars from the date of Roman conquest, or the establishment of Roman rule.

The [[Spanish era]] counted the years from 38 BC, probably the date of a new tax imposed by the Roman Republic on the subdued population of Iberia. The date marked the establishment of Roman rule in Spain and was used in official documents in Portugal, [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]], and in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], into the 14th century. This system of calibrating years fell to disuse in 1381 and was replaced by today's ''Anno Domini''.&lt;ref&gt;Gedaliah ibn Jechia the Spaniard, ''Shalshelet Ha-Kabbalah'', Jerusalem 1962, p. 271 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the Roman and Byzantine periods, the [[Decapolis]] and other Hellenized cities of Syria and Palestine used the [[Pompeian era]], counting dates from the Roman general [[Pompey]]'s conquest of the region in 63 BC.

===Maya===
A different form of calendar was used to track longer periods of time, and for the inscription of calendar dates (i.e., identifying when one event occurred in relation to others). This form, known as the Long Count, is based upon the number of elapsed days since a mythological starting-point. According to the calibration between the Long Count and Western calendars accepted by the great majority of Maya researchers (known as the GMT correlation), this starting-point is equivalent to August 11, 3114 BC in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or 6 September in the Julian calendar (−3113 astronomical).

===Other dating systems===
A great many local systems or [[era]]s were also important, for example the year from the foundation of one particular city, the regnal year of the neighboring [[History of Persia|Persian emperor]], and eventually even the year of the reigning [[Caliph]].

==Late Antiquity and Middle Ages==
Most of the traditional calendar eras in use today were introduced at the time of transition from [[Late Antiquity]] to the [[Early Middle Ages]], roughly between the 6th and 10th centuries.

===Christian era===
*The ''[[Etos Kosmou]]'' of the [[Byzantine Calendar]] places Creation at the beginning of its year 1, namely 5509 BC. Its first known use occurred in the 7th century AD, although its precursors were developed about AD 400. The year 7509 of this era began in September 2000.
*The [[Era of Martyrs]] or Era of Diocletian is reckoned from the beginning of the reign of Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]]; the first year of this era was 284/5. It was not the custom to use regnal years in Rome, but it was the custom in Roman Egypt, which the emperor ruled through a prefect (the king of Egypt). The year number changed on the first day of the Egyptian month [[Thoth]] (29 August three years out of four, 30 August the year before a Roman leap year.) Diocletian abolished the special status of Egypt, which thereafter followed the normal Roman calendar: consular years beginning on 1 January. This era was used in the Easter tables prepared in Alexandria long after the abdication of Diocletian, even though Diocletian was a notorious persecutor of Christians. The Era of Diocletian was retained by the [[Coptic calendar|Coptic Church]] and used for general purposes, but by 643 the name had been changed to Era of the Martyrs.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|766–7}}
*The [[Ethiopian calendar|Incarnation Era]] is used by [[Ethiopia]]. Its epoch is August 29, AD 8 in the Julian calendar.
*The [[Armenian calendar]] has its era fixed at AD 552.

====Dionysian "Common Era"====
{{Main|Anno Domini|Common Era}}

The era based on the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]] of [[Christ]] was introduced by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in 525 and is in continued use with various reforms and derivations. The distinction between the Incarnation being the conception or the [[Nativity of Jesus]] was not drawn until the late ninth century.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|881}} The beginning of the numbered year varied from place to place: when, in 1600, Scotland adopted January 1 as the date the year number changes, this was already the case in much of continental Europe. England adopted this practice in 1752.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;{{rp|7}}

* A.D. (or AD) – for the [[Latin]] ''[[Anno Domini]]'', meaning "in the year of (our) Lord". This is the dominant or Western Christian Era; AD is used in the Gregorian calendar. ''[[Anno Salutis]]'', meaning "in the year of salvation" is identical. Originally intended to number years from the Incarnation of [[Jesus]], according to modern thinking the calculation was a few years off. Years preceding AD 1 are numbered using the BC era, avoiding zero or negative numbers. AD was also used in the medieval [[Julian calendar]], but the first day of the year was either March 1, [[Easter]], March 25, September 1, or December 25, not January 1. To distinguish between the Julian and Gregorian calendars, ''O.S.'' and ''N.S.'' were often added to the date, especially during the 17th and 18th centuries, when both calendars were in common use. [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] (O.S.) was used for the Julian calendar and for years not beginning on January 1. [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] (N.S.) was used for the Gregorian calendar and for Julian calendar years beginning on January 1. Many countries switched to using January 1 as the start of the numbered year at the same time as they switched from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, but others switched earlier or later.
* B.C. (or BC) – meaning "Before Christ". Used for years before AD 1, counting backwards so the year ''n'' BC is ''n'' years before AD 1. Thus there is no [[year zero|year 0]].
* C.E. (or CE) and B.C.E. (or BCE)  – meaning "[[Common Era]]" and "Before the Common Era", numerically equivalent to AD and BC, respectively (in writing, "AD" ''precedes'' the year number, but "CE" ''follows'' the year: AD 1 = 1 CE.)&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press Stylebook''. (2007). New York: Basic Books. p. 6. {{ISBN|978-0-465-00489-8}}. "Because the full phrase would read ''in the year of the Lord 96'', the abbreviation A.D. goes before the figure for the year: ''A.D. 96.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The  Latin equivalent ''vulgaris aera'' was used as early as 1615  by [[Johannes Kepler]].&lt;ref&gt;A 1635 English edition of that book has the title page in English – so far, the earliest-found usage of "Vulgar Era" in English. The English phrase "common Era" appears at least as early as 1708.{{cn|date=May 2018}}
In Latin, "Common Era" is written as ''Vulgaris Aera''. It also occasionally appears as ''æra vulgaris'', ''aera vulgaris'', ''anni vulgaris'', ''vulgaris aera Christiana'', and ''anni vulgatae nostrae aerae Christianas''.&lt;/ref&gt; The English abbreviations C.E. and B.C.E. were introduced in the 19th century  by Jewish intellectuals, wishing to avoid the abbreviation for ''dominus'' "lord" in implicit reference to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Use of "C.E." and "B.C.E.": [[Morris Jacob Raphall]]. ''Post-Biblical History of The Jews'' (1856). 
Explicit use of "b.c.e." for "before the common era": 
Max Stern, ''Lemaʼan Yilmedu: A Second Hebrew Reader for Jewish Schools and Private Instruction'' (1881), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; By the later 20th century, the abbreviations had come into wider usage by authors who wished to emphasize [[secularism]].&lt;ref&gt; John Sumser, ''The Conflict Between Secular and Religious Narratives in the United States: Wittgenstein, Social Construction, and Communication'' (2016), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=5SFsDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA69   p. 69].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Dionysian-derived=====
* [[Astronomical year numbering]] equates its year 0 with 1 BC, and counts negative years from 2 BC backward (−1 backward), so 100 BC is −99.
* The [[Holocene calendar|human era]], also named Holocene era, proposed by [[Cesare Emiliani]] adds 10,000 to AD years, so that AD 1 would be the year 10,001.&lt;ref&gt;Cesare, E. (1993). [Correspondence]. ''Nature, 336'', 716.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[Anno Lucis]]'' of [[Freemasonry]] adds 4000 years to the AD year.

===Islamic===
*[[Anno Hegirae|A.H.]] (or AH) – for the Latinized ''[[Anno Hegirae]]'', meaning "in the year of the [[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]", [[Muhammad]]'s flight from Mecca to Medina in September 622, which occurred in its first year, used in the [[Islamic calendar]]. Since the Islamic calendar is a purely [[lunar calendar]] of about 354 days, its year count increases faster than that of [[solar calendar|solar]] and [[lunisolar calendar]]s.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}
*[[A.H.S.]] (or AHS){{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} is used by the [[Iranian calendar]] to denote the number of ''solar'' years since the Hijra. The year beginning at the vernal equinox equals the number of the Gregorian year beginning at the preceding January 1 minus 621.{{citation needed|date = June 2017}}

===Hindu===
*[[Hindu calendar]], counting from the start of the [[Kali Yuga]], with its epoch on February 18, 3102 BC Julian (January 23, 3102 BC Gregorian), based on Aryabhata (6th century).
*[[Vikrama Samvat]], 56-57 BC, introduced about the 12th century.
*[[Saka Era|S.E.]] or (SE) – for the [[Saka|Saka Era]], used in some [[Hindu calendar]]s and in the [[Indian national calendar]], with an epoch near the vernal equinox of year 78 (its year 0); its usage spread to Southeast Asia before year 1000. This era is also used (together with the Gregorian calendar) in the Indian national calendar, the official civil calendar used in communiques issued by the Government of India.

===Southeast Asia===
The Hindu Saka Era influences the calendars of southeast Asian [[Greater India|indianized kingdom]]s.
*[[Buddhist calendar|B.E.]] – for the [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist Era]], introduced by [[Vajiravudh]] in 1912, which has an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]] (origin) of 544 BC. This year is called year 1 in [[Sri Lanka]] and [[Burma]], but year 0 in [[Thailand]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]. Thus the year 2500 B.E. occurred in 1956 in the former countries, but in 1957 in the latter. In Thailand in 1888 King [[Chulalongkorn]] decreed a National Thai Era, dating from the founding of [[Bangkok]] on April 6, 1782. In 1912 New Year's Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941 Prime Minister [[Plaek Pibulsonggram|Phibunsongkhram]] decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the [[Thai solar calendar]] using the Thai Buddhist Era aligned to the western solar calendar.
*'''BE''' for Burmese Era – from [[Burmese calendar]] originally with an epochal year 0 date of 22 March 638; from which derived '''CS''' for [[Chula Sakarat]] era; variously known as '''LE''' Lesser Era; '''ME''' Minor Era – the Major or Great Era being the [[Saka Era]] of the [[Indian national calendar]]
:B.E. of the Bahá'í calendar is below.

===Bahá'í===
*[[Bahai calendar|B.E.]] – The [[Bahá'í calendar]] dates from the year of the declaration of the [[Báb]]. Years are counted in the Bahá'í Era (BE), which starts its year 1 from March 21, 1844.

===Jewish===
*[[Anno Mundi|A.M.]] (or AM) – for the Latin ''[[Anno Mundi]]'', meaning "in the year of the world", has its epoch in the year 3761 BC. This was first used to number the years of the modern [[Hebrew calendar]] in 1178 by [[Maimonides]]. Precursors with epochs one or two years later were used since the 3rd century, all based on the [[Seder Olam Rabba]] of the 2nd century. The year beginning in the northern autumn of 2000 was 5761 AM).

===Zoroastrian===
*The [[Zoroastrian calendar]] used regnal years since the reform by [[Ardeshir I]], but after the fall of the [[Sassanid empire]], the ascension of the last Sassanid ruler, [[Yazdegerd III of Persia]], crowned June 16, 632, continued to be used as the reference year, abbreviated [[Yazdegerd era|Y.Z.]] or "Yazdegerd era".

==Modern==
{{main|List of calendars}}

===Political===
*The Republican Era of the [[French Republican Calendar]] was dated from September 22, 1792, the day of the proclamation of the [[French First Republic]]. It was used in Revolutionary France from October 24, 1793 (on the Gregorian calendar) to December 31, 1805.
*The [[Positivist calendar]] of 1844 takes 1789 as its epoch.
*The [[Minguo calendar|Republican era]] is used by the [[Republic of China]] since 1912, which is the first year of the republic. Coincidentally, this is the same as the [[Juche#Calendar|Juche era]] used in [[North Korea]], the year of the birth of its founder [[Kim Il-Sung]].
* The [[Era Fascista]] 'Fascist Era' was instituted by the [[Fascism|Italian Fascists]] and used [[Roman numerals]] to denote the number of years since the [[March on Rome]] in 1922. Therefore, 1934, for example, was XII E.F. (''era fascista''). This era was abolished with the fall of fascism in Italy on July 25, 1943, but restored in the northern part of the country during the [[Italian Social Republic]]. The Gregorian calendar remained in simultaneous use and a double numbering was adopted: the year of the [[Common era]] was presented in Arabic numerals and the year of the fascist era in Roman numerals. The year of the Fascist calendar began on October 29, so, for example, October 27, 1933 was XI E.F. but October 30, 1933 was XII E.F.
*China traditionally reckoned by the regnal year of its emperors, see [[Chinese era name]]. Most Chinese do not assign numbers to the years of the [[Chinese calendar]], but the few who do, like expatriate Chinese, use a continuous count of years from the reign of the legendary [[Yellow Emperor]], using 2698 BC as year 1. Western writers begin this count at either 2637 BC or 2697 BC (see [[Chinese calendar#Beginnings|Chinese calendar]]). Thus, the Chinese years 4637, 4697, or 4698 began in early 2000.
*In Korea, from 1952 until 1961 years were numbered via ''[[Dangun#Dating|Dangi]]'' years, where 2333 BC was regarded as the first such year.
*The [[Assyrian calendar]], introduced in the 1950s, has its era fixed at 4750 BC.
*The [[Japanese calendar]] dates from the accession of the current [[Emperor of Japan]]. The current emperor took the throne in early 1989, which became Heisei 1, which was until then Shōwa 64 (for its first seven days).
*The [[United States]] government sometimes uses a calendar of the era of its [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence]], fixed on July 4, 1776, together with the ''Anno Domini'' civil calendar. For instance, its [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] is dated "the Seventeenth Day of September in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and Eighty seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the Twelfth."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html U.S. Constitution]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Presidential proclamation (United States)|Presidential proclamations]] are also dated in this way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/ The White House: Presidential Actions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious===
*[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health#Role in Scientology|A.D.]] – "After [[Dianetics]]". In [[Scientology]], years are numbered relative to the first publication of the book ''[[Dianetics: The Modern Science of Mental Health]]'' (1950).&lt;ref name="LATcostly"&gt;Sappell, J., &amp; Welkos, R. W. (1990, June 28). [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062890,0,6570814.story Costly Strategy Continues to Turn Out Bestsellers]. ''Los Angeles Times.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Discordian calendar|Y.O.L.D.]] – In the [[Discordian calendar]], the standard designation for the year number is YOLD (Year of [[Eris (mythology)|Our Lady of Discord]]). The calendar begins counting from January 1, 1166 BC in the [[Discordian]] year 0, ostensibly the date of origin of the [[Greyface|Curse of Greyface]]. An alternate designation, A.D.D. has been occasionally seen (Anno Domina Discordia, a Latin translation of YOLD, but presumably also a play on [[attention deficit disorder]]).
*e.v. – ''Era vulgaris''. (From Latin, meaning "common era", usually stylized in lowercase.) The [[Thelemic]] calendar is used by some Thelemites to designate a number of years since [[Aleister Crowley]]'s inauguration of the so-called [[Aeon_(Thelema)#Aeon_of_Horus|Aeon of Horus]], which occurred on March 20, 1904, and coincides with both the Thelemic new year and a holiday known as the Equinox of the Gods. The abbreviation "A.N.", for ''Aerae Novae'' ("New Era" in Latin), is sometimes also used.

===Practical===
*[[Before Present|B.P.]] – for [[Before Present]], specifically, the number of [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon]] years before 1950.
*[[Human Era|HE]] – for counting elapsed years of the [[Holocene]] from near the beginning of the [[Neolithic revolution]] of the [[Holocene epoch]], specifically by adding exactly 10,000 years to AD (Anno Domini) or CE (Common Era) years, and subtracting BC/BCE years from 10001.
*[[Julian day number]] – for counting days, not years, its era fixed at noon January 1, 4713 BC in the [[proleptic Julian calendar]]. This equals November 24, 4714 BC in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. From noon of this day to noon of the next day was day 0. Multiples of 7 are Mondays. Negative values can also be used. Apart from the choice of the zero point and name, this Julian day and Julian date are not related to the [[Julian calendar]]. It does not count years, so, strictly speaking, it has no era, but it does have an [[epoch (reference date)|epoch]]. Today (noon-to-noon UTC) the value is {{#expr:({{CURRENTJULIANDAY}}-0.5) round 0}}.
* [[Unix time]] – for counting elapsed seconds since the [[Unix epoch]] set at 00:00:00 or midnight UTC of January 1, 1970, though there are problems with Unix implementation of [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC).

In [[evolutionary biology]], '''carcinisation''' (or '''carcinization''') is a hypothesised process whereby a [[crustacean]] [[evolution|evolves]] into a [[crab]]-like form from a non-crab-like form. The term was introduced by [[Lancelot Alexander Borradaile|L. A.

The longest-serving faculty member of the [[University of Maine at Presque Isle]], she joined the staff in 1946 and developed the curriculum for the physical education department. She continued as a classroom instructor until her retirement in 2005. She also made the largest-ever gift to the university, a $500,000 donation toward the establishment of a health and physical education complex which was named in her honor. She was inducted into the [[Maine Women's Hall of Fame]] in 2000 and the Maine Sports Legends Hall of Honors in 2003.

She had four brothers and four sisters.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

At Newton High School, she played [[field hockey]], [[soccer]], [[basketball]], [[baseball]], [[tennis]], [[badminton]], and [[bowling]], and was named "most athletic" in her high school [[yearbook]].&lt;ref name=ton&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/newtonian1942newt/newtonian1942newt_djvu.txt|title=Newtonian|publisher=Internet Archive|year=1942|accessdate=27 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned her B.S. from [[Boston University College of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences (Sargent College)|Sargent College]], a unit of [[Boston University]], in 1946, and her M.A. from [[New York University]] in 1949.&lt;ref name=uma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uma.edu/community/maine-womens-hall-of-fame/|title=Maine Women's Hall of Fame Honorees – Caroline Gentile|publisher=[[University of Maine at Augusta]]|year=2016|accessdate=27 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306082338/http://www.uma.edu/community/maine-womens-hall-of-fame/|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also pursued graduate studies at the [[University of Wisconsin]] and [[Columbia University]].&lt;ref name=uma/&gt;

==Career==
In 1946 she was hired by the Aroostook State Normal School as an instructor for its Health, Physical Education and Recreation (HPER) program, at a starting yearly salary of $1,800.&lt;ref name=natural&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19951025&amp;id=CahJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Ig4NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4101,2617933&amp;hl=en|title=Veteran gym teacher is a natural educator|first=Gloria|last=Flannery|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=25 October 1995|page=C1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentile was one of seven staff instructors who revived the school, which had been closed during World War II. She developed the curriculum for the physical education department, which began offering a teaching degree in health, physical education, and recreation in 1949.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; The school went through various name changes until becoming known as the University of Maine at Presque Isle.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt;

In addition to her teaching responsibilities, Gentile assumed leadership roles on campus. She helped establish the faculty union and served as its president on two different occasions; she also twice served as president of the university senate. She chaired the HPER division for two decades. She directed the university's [[Graduation|commencement exercises]] for more than 50 years.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; She retired on July 1, 2005 with the title of associate professor emeritus of education.&lt;ref name=bene&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bangordailynews.com/2008/09/23/news/down-east/longtime-umpi-benefactor-faculty-member-dies/|title= Long-time UMPI benefactor, faculty member dies|first=Jen|last=Lynds|date=23 September 2008|accessdate=27 February 2016|work=Bangor Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the longest-serving faculty member at the University of Maine at Presque Isle.&lt;ref name=bene/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3565">'''The Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts (CSNTM)''' is a non-profit organization set out to preserve ancient manuscripts of the New Testament. This aim is accomplished by taking high resolution digital photographs of all extant Greek New Testament [[biblical manuscripts|manuscripts]]. The organization was founded by [[Daniel B. Wallace]], a professor at [[Dallas Theological Seminary]], in Texas on September 13, 2002, and acts under the umbrella of The Center for the Research of Early Christian Documents (CRECD). Wallace is the executive director of CSNTM. 

Wallace has said the goal of the center is to photograph 1.3 million leaves of Greek New Testament manuscripts, and estimates this goal will not be reached until 2020.&lt;ref name="dallasnews"&gt;Fleck, Deborah"[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/religion/stories/DN-relnewtestament_08met.ART.Central.Edition1.4688c1c.html Fleck, Deborah, "Center for the Study of New Testament Manuscripts working to preserve ancient pieces,"] The Dallas Morning News, March 8, 2008. Retrieved April 18, 2008. Additional information from other sources.&lt;/ref&gt; The CSNTM team has already photographed manuscripts in [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Constantinople at the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church]]; the [[Institute for New Testament Textual Research|Institut für neutestamentliche Textforschung]] (INTF) in Münster, Germany; [[Tübingen University]], Germany; the Monastery of St. John the Theologian on the island of Patmos, Greece; the National Archive in Tirana, Albania; the [[University of Michigan]]; several colleges at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]; [[University of Glasgow]]; [[Gennadius Library]]; [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]], The [[Chester Beatty Library]], various locations throughout Greece, and other sites. The Center and Wallace have also examined manuscripts in Vienna, Cologne, Florence, Berlin, at St. Catherine’s Monastery (Sinai), The [[Vatican City|Vatican]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], [[Oxford University]], the University of Dresden, [[Harvard University]], the British Library, [[Princeton University]], and several other sites.

The activity of CSNTM is limited by several factors, including international law, finances, and the traditional thinking of the other institutions regarding the copying of valuable manuscripts. In spite of these difficulties CSNTM has digital images of:
* [[Codex Sinaiticus]]
* [[Codex Alexandrinus]]
* [[Codex Vaticanus]]
* [[Codex Washingtonianus]]
* [[Codex Boernerianus]]
* [[Codex Beratinus]]

Although the primary focus of the CSNTM is [[digital preservation]] of New Testament manuscripts, it also works with printed books related to textual criticism such as von Soden's Greek New Testament ("Die Schriften des Neuen Testaments, in ihrer ältesten erreichbaren Textgestalt hergestellt auf Grund ihrer Textgeschichte," Verlag von Arthur Glaue, Berlin 1902-1910). CSNTM holds also one manuscript of New Testament, Gregory-Aland minuscule 2882, a 10th- or 11th-century copy of Luke’s Gospel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8419">'''Nanoceramic''' is a type of [[nanoparticle]] that is composed of [[Ceramic materials|ceramics]], which are generally classified as inorganic, heat-resistant, nonmetallic solids made of both metallic and nonmetallic compounds. The material offers unique properties. [[macroscopic scale|Macroscale]] ceramics are brittle and rigid and break upon impact. However, nanoceramics take on a larger variety of functions,&lt;ref name="main"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abdelrazek Khalil|first1=Khalil|title=Advanced Sintering of Nano-Ceramic Materials|journal=Ceramic Materials - Progress in Modern Ceramics|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[dielectric]], [[ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]], [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]], [[pyroelectricity|pyroelectric]], [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]], [[magnetoresistance|magnetoresistive]], [[superconductivity|superconductive]] and [[electro-optic effect|electro-optical]].

Nanoceramics were discovered in the early 1980s. They were formed using a process called [[sol-gel]] which mixes nanoparticles within a solution and gel to form the nanoparticle. Later methods involved [[sintering]] (pressure and heat). The material is so small that it has basically no flaws. Larger scale materials have flaws that render them brittle.

In 2014 researchers announced a lasering process involving polymers and ceramic particles to form a nanotruss. This structure was able to recover its original form after repeated crushing.

== Properties ==
Nanoceramics have unique properties because of their size and molecular structure. These properties are often shown in terms of various electrical and magnetic physics phenomenons which include: 
*[[Dielectric]] - An electrical insulator that can be polarized (having electrons aligned so that there is a negative and positive side of the compound) by an electric field to shorten the distance of electron transfer in an electric current
*[[ferroelectricity|Ferroelectric]] - Dielectric materials that polarize in more than one direction (the negative and positive sides can be flipped via an electric field)
*[[piezoelectricity|Piezoelectric]] - Materials that accumulate an electrical charge under mechanical stress
*[[pyroelectricity|Pyroelectric]] - Material that can produce a temporary voltage given a temperature change
*[[ferromagnetism|Ferromagnetic]] - Materials that can to sustain a magnetic field after magnetization
*[[magnetoresistance|Magnetoresistive]] - Materials that change electrical resistance under an external magnetic field
*[[superconductivity|Superconductive]] - Materials that exhibit zero electric resistance when cooled to a critical temperature
*[[electro-optic effect|Electro-optical]] - Materials that change optical properties under an electric field

=== Nanotruss ===
Nanoceramic is more than 85% air and is very light, strong, flexible and durable. The fractal nanotruss is a nanostructure architecture&lt;ref name="Caltech 2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fesenmaier|first1=Kimm|title=Ceramics Don't Have To Be Brittle|url=http://www.caltech.edu/content/ceramics-dont-have-be-brittle|website=Caltech|accessdate=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; made of [[alumina]], or [[aluminum oxide]]. Its maximum compression is about 1 micron from a thickness of 50 nanometers. After its compression, it can revert to its original shape without any structural damage.

== Synthesis ==

=== Sol-gel ===
One process for making nanoceramics varies is the [[sol-gel|sol-gel process]], also known as chemical solution deposition. This involves a chemical solution, or the sol, made of nanoparticles in liquid phase and a [[Precursor (chemistry)|precursor]], usually a gel or polymer, made of molecules immersed in a [[solvent]]. The sol and gel are mixed to produce an oxide material which are generally a type of ceramic. The excess products (a liquid solvent) are evaporated. The particles desires are then heated in a process called densification to produce a solid product.&lt;ref name="Sol-gel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Chen-Chi|last2=Ying|first2=Jackie Y.|title=Sol−Gel Synthesis and Hydrothermal Processing of Anatase and Rutile Titania Nanocrystals|journal=Chemistry of Materials |date=September 15, 1999|volume=11|issue=11|pages=3113–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method could also be applied to produce a nanocomposite by heating the gel on a thin film to form a nanoceramic layer on top of the film.

=== Two-photon lithography ===
This process uses a laser technique called two-photon lithography to etch out a [[polymer]] into a three-dimensional structure. The laser hardens the spots that it touches and leaves the rest unhardened. The unhardened material is then dissolved to produce a "shell". The shell is then coated with ceramic, metals, metallic glass, etc. In the finished state, the nanotruss&lt;ref name="Nanotruss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fesenmaier|first1=Kimm|title=Miniature Truss Work|url=http://www.caltech.edu/content/miniature-truss-work|website=Caltech|accessdate=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of ceramic can be flattened and revert to its original state.

=== Sintering ===
In another approach [[sintering]] was used to consolidate nanoceramic powders using high temperatures. This resulted in a rough material that damages the properties of ceramics and requires more time to obtain an end product. This technique also limits the possible final geometries. Microwave sintering was developed to overcome such problems. Radiation is produced from a [[magnetron]], which produces electromagnetic waves to vibrate and heat the powder. This method allows for heat to be instantly transferred across the entire volume of material instead of from the outside in.&lt;ref name="main"/&gt;

The nanopowder is placed in an insulation box composed of low insulation boards to allow the microwaves to pass through it.The box increases temperature to aid absorption. Inside the boxes are suspectors that absorb microwaves at room temperature to initialize the sintering process. The microwave heats the suspectors to about 600&amp;nbsp;°C, sufficient to trigger the nanoceramics to absorb the microwaves.

==History==
In the early 1980s, the first nanoparticles, specifically nanoceramics were formed, using [[sol-gel]]. This process was replaced by sintering in the early 2000s and then by microwave sintering. None of these techniques proved suitable for large scale production.

In 2002, researchers tried to reverse engineer the microstructure of [[seashells]] to strengthen ceramics.&lt;ref name=seashells&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claire Diop|first1=Julie|title=R&amp;D 2002:Nano Ceramics|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/featuredstory/401725/rd-2002-nano-ceramics/|website=MIT Technology Review|accessdate=December 1, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; They discovered that seashells' durability come from their "microarchitecture". Research began to focus on how ceramics could employ such an architecture.

In 2012 researchers replicated the sea sponge's structure using ceramics&lt;ref name="Caltech"&gt;{{cite web|last1 = Fesenmaier|first1 = Kimm|title = Made-to-Order Materials|url = http://www.caltech.edu/content/made-order-materials|website = Caltech|accessdate = 5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[nanoarchitecture]] called nanotruss.&lt;ref name="Nanotruss"/&gt; As of 2015 the largest result is a 1mm cube. The lattice structure compresses up to 85% of its original thickness and can recover to its original form. These lattices are stabilized into triangles with cross-members for structural integrity and flexibility.

== Applications ==
Medical technology used nanoceramics for bone repair. It has been suggested for areas including energy supply and storage, communication, transportation systems, construction and medical technology. Their electrical properties may allow energy to be transferred efficiencies approaching 100%. Nanotrusses may be eventually applicable for building materials, replacing concrete or steel.&lt;ref name="Biomedical"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Nissan|first1 = Ben|title = Nanoceramics in Biomedical Applications|journal = MRS Bulletin|date = January 2014|volume = 29|issue = 1|pages = 28–32|url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231959874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coreshine''' is an astronomical term for [[infrared]] light scattered by unusually large grains of dust in the denser core regions of [[molecular clouds]] and which evidently begin their growth before the start of cloud collapse. These clouds which are opaque to visible light, are a mixture of gas and dust and are the regions where stars are formed.

Coreshine offers a new tool for observing the earliest phases of [[star formation]], a process effectively hidden up to now. The scattered mid-infrared light, found throughout our galaxy, could reveal the origins of the cloud material, the size and density of the dust particles, the age of the core region, the distribution of the dust and gas, and the chemical processes taking place deep inside the cloud.

The phenomenon was first studied seriously with [[NASA]]’s [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. Researchers Laurent Pagani ([[CNRS]], [[Paris Observatory]]), Jürgen Steinacker ([[Max Planck Institute for Astronomy]]) and colleagues from the [[California Institute of Technology]] and ''Laboratoire d’Astrophysique de l’Observatoire de Grenoble'', discovered surprisingly bright mid-infrared radiation from the core of the molecular cloud L183 in the constellation [[Serpens Cauda]] 360 light-years away. Using computer simulations, it became clear that they were observing light scattered by particles of around 1 micrometer in diameter. In a follow-up they studied 110 molecular clouds, at distances between 300 and 1300 light-years, and which had been part of previous Spitzer surveys. The results showed that coreshine is a widespread phenomenon and was present in about half the clouds studied. Clouds in the southern constellation [[Vela (constellation)|Vela]] show no coreshine and it is thought that this has been brought about by recorded supernova explosions in the region, blowing away or destroying larger dust particles.

Coreshine will lead to new projects for both the Spitzer and [[James Webb Space Telescope]], due to be launched in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/ Universe Today]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aanda.org/index.php?option=com_article&amp;access=standard&amp;Itemid=129&amp;url=/articles/aa/full_html/2010/03/aa12835-09/aa12835-09.html Direct evidence of dust growth in L183 from mid-infrared light scattering - Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens''''' is a [[Gram-positive]] [[bacterium]] that causes disease on a variety of [[plant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens Septic Arthritis following Puncture with a Coxspur Hawthorn Thorn |author1=Michelle J. Francis |author2=Richard R. Doherty |author3=Minoo Patel |author4=John F. Hamblin |author5=Samar Ojaimi |author6=Tony M. Korman |journal=Journal of Clinical Microbiology |date=2 May 2011 |volume=49 |issue=7 |pages=2759–2760 |doi=10.1128/JCM.00340-11 |pmc=3147839 |pmid=21562106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gram-positive bacterium characteristics include small irregular rods, lateral flagella, the ability to persist in aerobic environments, and cells containing catalase. In the interest of studying pathogenicity in plants, the species ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens'' is broken down further into [[pathovar]]s, which help to better describe the pathogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Agrios g.n. 2005. plant pathology 5th edition |author1=George N. Agriosrman |publisher=Academic Press, New York, USA|date=October 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hosts and symptoms==
''Curtobacterium flaccumfacien'' is a bacterial wilt pathogen. The hallmark symptoms of bacterial wilt are leaf and [[Petiole (botany)|petiole]] wilting. [[Chlorosis]] of the leaf and tissue occurs due to the lack of water transport. ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens'' as a species has a wide host range not limited to kidney beans, soybeans, tulips, and tomatoes.  However, the species is artificially separated into a pathovar based on host range and symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens on Soybean in Germany–A Threat for Farming |author1=U.F. Sammer |author2=K. Reiher |journal= Journal of Phytopathology |date=2012 |volume=160 |issue=6 |pages=314–316 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0434.2012.01902.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the economically important pathovars is ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. Flaccumfaciens''. This pathovar is classified as bacterial wilt and has a primary host range of the genus ''Phaseolus'' (beans), but the pathogen can infect many other species of the ''Fabaceae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Bacterial diseases of dry edible beans in the Central High Plains |author1= R. M. Harveson |author2= H. F. Schwartz |author3= U. Mazzucchi |journal= Plant Health Prog. |date=2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In beans the symptoms can be devastating to the crop yield. These beans have severe foliage wilting and chlorosis.

One ornamental example is ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. oortii''. The  primary host are plants from the genus ''Tulipa'' (Tulip).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Bacterial wilt disease and the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex |author1=C. Allen |author2=P. Prior |author3=A.C Hayward |publisher= American Phytopathological Society |date=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the host range differs, the symptoms are relatively similar. During flowering typical symptoms of dehydration are observed. Similarly to beans, the tulips get wilt. In severe cases, the plant eventually fails to recover from wilting and dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Taxonomy of plant-pathogenic coryneform bacteria |author1= M.J. Davis |journal= Annual Review of Phytopathology |date=1986 |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=115–140 |doi=10.1146/annurev.phyto.24.1.115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disease cycle==
'''Survival'''
''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens'' can overwinter in plant debris, diseased plants, wild hosts, seeds, or vegetative propagative organs. The bacteria can survive only a couple of weeks as free bacteria in soil. Multiple factors go into survival of a bacterial population, including [[temperature]], [[humidity]], and [[soil]] characteristics. Infected seeds cannot be used for susceptible bean crops because ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens'' has been known to survive in dried bean pods from five years and up to 24 years in laboratory conditions. Different pathovars survive in slightly different ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Survival of Curtobacterium Flaccumfaciens pv. Flaccumfaciens in Soil and Bean Crop Debris |author1=T. S. Júnior |author2=D. R. Negrão |author3= A. T. Itako |author4= J. M. Soman |author5= A. C. Maringoni |journal= Journal of Plant Pathology |date=2012 |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages= 331–337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. oortii'' survive in the vegetative propagative organs (bulbs) rather than in the seeds, like ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Bacterial wilt disease and the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex |author1=C. Allen |author2=P. Prior |author3=A.C Hayward |publisher= American Phytopathological Society |date=2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dispersal'''
Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens causes wilting at high populations and disperses in many ways. The bacteria multiply relatively quickly which increases the possibility that ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens'' can shed from dying or dead plant material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |url=http://booksite.elsevier.com/samplechapters/9780120445653/0120445654_FM.pdf|title= Agrios g.n. 2005. plant pathology 5th edition |author1=George N. Agriosrman |publisher=Academic Press, New York, USA|date=October 9, 2005|accessdate=4 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pathogen is normally dispersed via agricultural practices such as, planting saved seed and through farm equipment. In the case of beans &amp; tulips these practices move the [[propagule]] during overwriting phase of their life cycles. This is effective dispersal for the pathogen. 
'''Infection'''
''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens'' usually enters the plant though a wound. Natural wounds (created by excision of flowers or  genesis of lateral roots) and unnatural wounds could become entry sites. There are no reports of vectors, but the nematode ''Meloidogyne incognita'' may assist entry by providing unnatural wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |title= Multilingual compendium of plant diseases |author1= P. R. Miller |author2= H. L. Pollard |publisher= American Phytopathological Society |date=1976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Management varies for each between hosts. For this purpose, we will look specifically at the detection and control methods of ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaciens''. Since most plant pathogens are Gram-negative detection of Gram-positive bacterium, using methods such as the [[KOH test]], is a beginners diagnostic tool used to identify this bacterium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Agrios g.n. 2005. plant pathology 5th edition |author1=George N. Agriosrman |publisher=Academic Press, New York, USA|date=October 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria may be detected beneath the [[seedcoat]] by means of a combined cultural and slide agglutination test. Bean seed from countries where the disease is known to occur should be inspected for discoloration of the seedcoat. Immunofluorescence staining can also be used to detect the bacterium in contaminated seed lots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Comparison of immunofluorescence staining and indirect isolation for the detection of Corynebacterium flaccumfaciens in bean seeds |author1= A. Calzolari |author2= M. Tomesani |author3= U. Mazzucchi |journal= EPPO Bulletin |date=1987 |volume=17 |issue=2 |pages=157–163 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2338.1987.tb00021.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Control may be affected by using disease-free seed and crop rotations. Seeds grown in dry climates are usually free from infection and are, therefore, recommended for distribution. The strongest control regulations handed down by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection (EPPO) to date was a [[quarantine]] procedure. There is little resistance available commercially to ''Curtobacterium flaccumfaciens pv. flaccumfaci''ens and antibiotics are ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Data sheets on quarantine organisms No. 48, Corynebacterium flaccumfaciens |author1= OEPP/EPPO |journal= Bulletin OEPP/EPPO Bulletin |date=1982 |volume=12 |issue=1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2663">In [[chemistry]], a '''diamino acid''', also called a '''diamino carboxylic acid''', is a [[molecule]] containing at least one [[carboxyl]] and two [[amine]] [[functional group]]s. Diamino acids belong to the class of [[amino acids]].

== Biochemical function ==
[[Asparagine]], [[glutamine]] and [[lysine]] are proteinaceous diamino acids which are components of [[protein]]s. These three diamino acids are coded by [[codon]]s of the genetic material and belong therefore to the cationic [[amino acid]]s.

[[Ornithine]] and 2,6-diamino[[pimelic acid]] are non-proteinaceous diamino acids.

In [[biochemistry]], diamino acids are of particular interest. Diamino acids are used for the synthesis of specific [[peptide nucleic acid]]s, such as daPNA. Artificial [[peptide nucleic acid]]s are capable of forming duplex structures with individual [[DNA]]- and [[RNA]]-strands and are, therefore, not only called [[DNA]]-analog, but also they are considered as candidates for the first genetic material on [[Earth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Egholm, M |author2=Buchardt, O |author3=Christensen, L |author4=Behrens, C |author5=Freier, SM |author6=Driver, DA |author7=Berg, RH |author8=Kim, SK |author9=Norden, B |author10=Nielsen, PW |title=PNA hybridizes to complementary oligonucleotides obeying the Watson-Crick hydrogen bonding rules |journal=Nature |volume=365 |issue= 6446|pages=566–568 |year= 1993|doi=10.1038/365566a0 |pmid=7692304|bibcode = 1993Natur.365..566E }}&lt;/ref&gt; The corresponding diamino acids such as 2,3-diaminopropanoic acid were detected in the [[Murchison meteorite]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Meierhenrich, UJ |author2=Munoz Caro, GM |author3=Bredehöft, JH |author4=Jessberger, EK |author5=Thiemann, WHP |title=Identification of diamino acids in the Murchison meteorite |journal=PNAS |volume=101 |issue= 25|pages=9182–9186 |year= 2004|doi=10.1073/pnas.0403043101 |pmid=15194825 |pmc=438950|bibcode = 2004PNAS..101.9182M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a simulated [[comet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Munoz Caro, GM |author2=Meierhenrich, UJ |author3=Schutte, WA |author4=Barbier, B |author5=Arcones Segovia, A |author6=Rosenbauer, H |author7=Thiemann, W |author8=Brack, A |author9=Greenberg, JM |title=Amino acids from ultraviolet irradiation of interstellar ice analogues |journal=Nature |volume=416 |issue= 6879|pages=403–406 |year= 2002|doi=10.1038/416403a |pmid=11919624|bibcode = 2002Natur.416..403M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eco-restructuring''' is the implication for an ecologically sustainable [[economy]].  The principle of [[ecological modernization]] establishes the core literature of the functions that eco-restructuring has within a global regime. Eco-restructuring has an emphasis on the technological progressions within an ecological system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maricica|first=D. I.|year=2011|title=Ecological modernisation a basis for the tourism sustainable development|url=|journal=Annals of DAAAM &amp; Proceedings|volume=22 |issue=1|pages=1357–1358|via=http://go.galegroup.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government officials implement environmental policies to establish the industrial- ecological progressions that enable the motion of economic modernization. When establishing economic growth, policy makers focus on the progression towards a sustainable environment by establishing a framework of ecological engineering. Government funding is necessary when investing in efficient technologies to stimulate technological development.

Environmental dimensions such as the preservation of landscape is achieved through [[sustainability]]. When analyzing the issues of sustainability, the importance of socio-technical transitions is highlighted to meet the needs of ecological policies. When an organization of resources is sustainable, it means that it will remain at a certain level of progress due to self-preservation without affecting the fundamental purpose of its existence.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2009|title=Sustainable development and the need for technological revolution|journal=Annals of DAAAM &amp; Proceeding|volume=20 |issue=1|pages=1061–1062|via=http://go.galegroup.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca/ps/i.do?&amp;id=GALE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the industrial sector allows for sustainability to progress in an effective manner. When eco-restructuring is applied to the concept of sustainability, environmentally friendly technologies are essentially the main framework for clean and efficient productions.

Social support and acknowledgement must be present when highlighting the functions of modernizing the ecological structures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buttel|first=F. H.|year=2000|title=Ecological modernization as social theory|journal=Geoforum|volume=31 |issue=1|pages=57–65|via=10.1016/S0016-7185(99)00044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; To have a smooth transition between socio-technical categories, social agreement is important when introducing eco-restructuring methods. When forming new ecological policies, policy makers focus on the movement that sustainable environments have in regards to the social expectations.

Economic [[Production (economics)|production]] is an example of the existing relationship between eco-restructuring and sustainability. Cleaner production with minimal impact on the environment is the main idea behind the correlation of the two subjects. Since [[industrial ecology]] contributes to the direction of sustainability, eco-restructuring is perceived as a benefit for the environment and natural adaptation. Critics of the eco-restructuring and sustainability policies argue that a clear balance between a self-preserving ecological system and mass production is difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=A.|year=1996|title=Ecotechnology in industrial practice: Implementation using sustainability indices and case studies|journal=Ecological Engineering|volume=7 |issue=2|pages=117–138|via=10.1016/0925- 8574(96)00005-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ecological engineering has been a major component used when applying eco-restructuring methods in the production of resources.

== Origins ==
In 1998, the book ''Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development'' was published by [[Robert Ayres (scientist)|Robert Ayres]]. The book provided a significant contribution to the research of industrial- ecological progressions. Robert Ayres introduced a new prototype of eco-restructuring for sustainable development of technologies, economic movement and social lifestyles.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nadkarni|first=M. V.|year=2000|title=Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development|journal=Indian Journal of Agricultural Economics|volume=55|pages=62–63|via=http://search.proquest.com.subzero.lib.uoguelph.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implication for cleaner and more efficient technologies contributes to the research of ecological construction.

=== Technologies ===

Efficient technologies are defined as services that reduce the non-renewable resources produced and increase the production rate.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duchin|first=F.|last2=Lange|first2=G. M.|last3=Kell|first3=G.|year=1995|title=Technological change, trade and the environment|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=14|pages=185–193|via=doi:10.1016/0921-8009(95)00014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable energy]] is a form of energy obtained from clean and natural resources. Solar and wind power technologies are examples of clean energy forms that would eliminate pollution produced from the coal and diesel energy sectors.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Economic movement ===

The economic movement outlined by Robert Ayers refers to the use of [[Green economy|green economies]]. This type of economy structure looks at ways to reduce the environmental impacts. Nations focus on steering their policy agenda to allow the implementation of ecological strategies. This will accelerate the transformation of the economy sectors towards a clean and effective ecological state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Social lifestyles ===

Human economic activities can influence the type of issues that ecological systems face. These social lifestyles are subject to the changes in the production of goods and services. An example of this idea would be the collection of raw materials and disposing them in a proper efficient manner that will have little impact on the environment.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; If the whole cycle is restructured to meet the principles of ecological regulation, then experts would have to analyze the effects of human activities and determine a possible alternative to the removal of [[biomedical waste]] and other raw materials.

Many of the eco-restructuring principles were outlined in the ''Eco-restructuring: Implications for Sustainable Development'' book. However, policy makers can also have an opinion on the ideas and promises that this method of sustainability offers. Certain factors can influence the regulations that the policies cover such as the need for sustainable development.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Legislative measures are also developed based on the propositions of ecological and economical advantages. The principle of sustainable development applies to the restructuring of technologies, economic movement and social lifestyles. These principles have helped to determine an evolution of the ecological system.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Environmental factors ==
When an ecological system is altered, environmental standards must be put in place to preserve the stability of the environment.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The application of eco-restructuring seeks to improve the environmental stability in relation to manufacturing and waste management. However, ecological effects can occur by following improper procedures. Despite the precautions that must be considered, there are environmental benefits of ecological modernization such as renewable energy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The use of renewable energy would eliminate the threat of ecological dangers such as pollution. Modern technologies also have a role in the impact of the environment. When new technologies are developed, sustainability is achieved through improving the environmental dimensions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Eco-restructuring and sustainability ==
Socio-technical transitions correlate to the need for social change in the study of sustainable resources. Sustainability has a significant role in the fields of management such as education, health care, economics, ecology and technology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The main framework for clean and efficient productions is supported by the idea of a self-preserving system. Despite the research supporting the reformation of the ecological system, natural resources can suffer a depletion and will need the support of sustainability to preserve its existence.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; New policies are required to move towards equality and sustainability since the social expectations reflect the relationship between the two concepts. The public perception for an alternative solution to sustainable development is reflected through the ecological policies enacted by government officials. Eco-restructuring offers a positive aspect to the principles of ecological modernization. It is an alternative to the motion of technological progressions within the global economic regime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6994">The '''electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide''' ('''ERC''') is the conversion of [[carbon dioxide]] to more [[reduction (chemistry)|reduced chemical species]] using electrical energy. The first examples of electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide are from the 19th century, when carbon dioxide was reduced to [[carbon monoxide]] using a [[zinc]] [[cathode]]. Research in this field intensified in the 1980s following the [[oil embargo]]es of the 1970s.  Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide represents a possible means of producing chemicals or fuels, converting carbon dioxide ({{CO2|link=yes}}) to organic feedstocks such as [[Formic acid|formic acid (HCOOH)]], [[Methanol|methanol (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH)]], [[Ethylene|ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], [[Methane|methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)]], and [[Carbon monoxide|carbon monoxide (CO)]].&lt;ref name=Centi&gt;Gabriele Centi, Siglinda Perathoner "Opportunities and prospects in the chemical recycling of carbon dioxide to fuels" Catalysis Today 148 (2009) 191–205.{{doi|10.1016/j.cattod.2009.07.075}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Qiao, et al., [http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2014/cs/c3cs60323g A review of catalysts for the electroreduction of carbon dioxide to produce low-carbon fuels], Chem.Soc.Rev., 2014, 43 , 631-675.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Jitaru&gt;Appel, A. M. et al.  "Frontiers, Opportunities, and Challenges in Biochemical and Chemical Catalysis of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Fixation", Chem. Rev. 2013, vol. 113, 6621-6658.  {{DOI|10.1021/cr300463y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemicals from carbon dioxide ==
In [[carbon fixation]], plants convert carbon dioxide into sugars, from which many biosynthetic pathways originate.  The catalyst responsible for this conversion, [[RuBisCo]], is the most common protein on earth. Some anaerobic organisms employ enzymes to convert CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to [[carbon monoxide]], from which fatty acids can be made.&lt;ref&gt;1. J. C. Fontecilla-Camps, P. Amara, C. Cavazza, Y. Nicolet and A. Volbeda, "Structure-function relationships of anaerobic gas-processing metalloenzymes", Nature 2009, volume 460, p. 814-822.{{doi|10.1038/nature08299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In industry, a few products are made from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, including [[urea]], [[salicylic acid]], [[methanol]], and certain inorganic and organic carbonates.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Topham, "Carbon Dioxide" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a05_165}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the laboratory, carbon dioxide is sometimes used to prepare [[carboxylic acid]]s.  No electrochemical process involving CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has been commercialized.

==Electrocatalysis==
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide to CO is usually described as:
: CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  +  2 e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;   →   CO   + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The redox potential for this reaction is similar to that for hydrogen evolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus electrochemical reduction of CO2 is usually competitive with hydrogen evolution reaction.&lt;ref name= Jitaru/&gt;

Electrochemical methods have gained significant attention: 1) at ambient pressure and room temperature; 2) in connection with renewable energy sources (see also [[solar fuel]]) 3) competitive controllability, modularity and scale-up is relatively simple.&lt;ref&gt;S. Lee et al., ChemSusChem 9 (2016) 333-344, Electrode Build-Up of Reducible Metal Composites toward Achievable Electrochemical Conversion of Carbon Dioxide{{DOI|10.1002/cssc.201501112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrochemical reduction or electrocatalytic conversion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can produce value-added chemicals such methane, ethylene, ethane, etc., and the products are mainly dependent on the selected catalysts and operating potentials (applying reduction voltage).&lt;ref&gt;S. Lee et al., Sustainable production of formic acid by electrolytic reduction of gaseous carbon dioxide, J. Mater. Chem. A, 2015,3, 3029-3034 {{DOI|10.1039/C4TA03893B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.T. Whipple et al., Prospects of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Utilization via Direct Heterogeneous Electrochemical Reduction J. Phys. Chem.

Although an electrochemical route to CO (or other chemicals) has not been commercialized, a variety of [[Homogeneous catalysis|homogeneous]] and [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Hori | first1 = Y. | chapter = Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Metal Electrodes | doi = 10.1007/978-0-387-49489-0_3 | title = Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry | series = Modern Aspects of Electrochemistry | volume = 42 | pages = 89–80 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-0-387-49488-3 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; have been evaluated.&lt;ref name='Jitaru'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Centi/&gt;  Many such processes are assumed to operate via the intermediacy of [[metal carbon dioxide complex]]es.&lt;ref&gt;Eric E.

'''Environmental education''' ('''EE''') refers to organized efforts to teach how natural environments function, and particularly, how human beings can manage behavior and [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] to [[Sustainable living|live sustainably]]. It is a multi-disciplinary field integrating disciplines such as biology, chemistry, physics, ecology, earth science, atmospheric science, mathematics, and geography. The [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation]] (UNESCO) states that EE is vital in imparting an inherent respect for nature amongst society and in enhancing public environmental awareness. UNESCO emphasises the role of EE in safeguarding future global developments of societal [[quality of life]] (QOL), through the protection of the environment, eradication of poverty, minimization of inequalities and insurance of sustainable development (UNESCO, 2014a). The term often implies education within the school system, from primary to post-secondary. However, it sometimes includes all efforts to educate the public and other audiences, including print materials, websites, media campaigns, etc.. There are also ways that environmental education is taught outside the traditional classroom. Aquariums, zoos, parks, and nature centers all have ways of teaching the public about the environment.

== Focus ==

Environmental education focuses on:

'''1.''' 	Engaging with citizens of all demographics to;

'''2.'''	Think critically, ethically, and creatively when evaluating environmental issues;

'''3.'''	Make educated judgments about those environmental issues;

'''4.'''	Develop skills and a commitment to act independently and collectively to sustain and enhance the environment; and,

'''5.''' 	To enhance their appreciation of the environment; resulting in positive environmental behavioural change (Bamberg &amp; Moeser, 2007; Wals et al., 2014).

== Attributes ==
There are a few central qualities involved in environmental education that are useful contributions to the individual. 

Environmental education:

== Careers ==
There are various different career paths one could delve into within environmental education. Many of these careers require discovering and planning how to resolve environmental issues occurring in today’s world. The location of someone with these careers has an impact on the clear responsibilities each must obtain depending on what environmental issue is most prevalent in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://environmentalsciencedegree.org/careers/|title=Top 5 Environmental Science Careers|work=Environmental Science Degree|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A general outlook of some careers in this field are:

* '''[[Citizen Science]] (CS)''' aims to address both scientific and environmental outcomes through enlisting the public in the collection of data, through relatively simple protocols, generally from local habitats over long periods of time (Bonney et al., 2009).
* '''[[Education for Sustainable Development]] (ESD)''' aims to reorient education to empower individuals to make informed decisions for environmental integrity, social justice, and economic viability for both present and future generations, whilst respecting cultural diversities (UNESCO, 2014b).
* '''[[Climate change education (CCE)|Climate Change Education (CCE)]]''' aims in enhancing the public's understanding of [[climate change]], its consequences, and its problems, and to prepare current and future generations to limit the magnitude of climate change and to respond to its challenges (Beatty, 2012). Specifically, CCE needs to help learners develop knowledge, skills and values and action to engage and learn about the causes, impact and management of climate change &lt;ref&gt;Chang, C. H. (2014).

* '''[[Science Education]] (SE)''' focuses primarily on teaching knowledge and skills, to develop innovative thought in society (Wals et al., 2014).
* '''[[Outdoor Education]] (OE)''' relies on the assumption that learning experiences outdoors in ‘nature’ foster an appreciation of nature, resulting in pro-environmental awareness and action (Clarke &amp; Mcphie,2014). Outdoor education means learning "in" and "for" the outdoors.
* '''[[Experiential education]] (ExE)''' is a process through which a learner constructs knowledge, skill, and value from direct experiences" (AEE, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;5) Experiential education can be viewed as both a process and method to deliver the ideas and skills associated with environmental education (ERIC, 2002).
* '''[[Garden-based learning]] (GBL)''' is an instructional strategy that utilizes the garden as a teaching tool. It encompasses programs, activities and projects in which the garden is the foundation for integrated learning, in and across disciplines, through active, engaging, real-world experiences that have personal meaning for children, youth, adults and communities in an informal outside learning setting.
* '''[[Inquiry-based Science]] (IBS)''' is an active open style of teaching in which students follow scientific steps in a similar manner as scientists to study some problem (Walker 2015). Often used in biological and environmental settings.

While each of these educational fields has their own objectives, there are points where they overlap with the intentions and philosophy of environmental education.

==History==

The roots of environmental education can be traced back as early as the 18th century when [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] stressed the importance of an education that focuses on the environment in ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]''. Several decades later, [[Louis Agassiz]], a Swiss-born naturalist, echoed Rousseau’s philosophy as he encouraged students to “Study nature, not books.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/agassiz.html Berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; These two influential scholars helped lay the foundation for a concrete environmental education program, known as [[nature study]], which took place in the late 19th and early 20th century.

The nature study movement used fables and moral lessons to help students develop an appreciation of nature and embrace the natural world.&lt;ref name="Cronon"&gt;Bill Cronon, [http://www.williamcronon.net/handouts/460_handout_15_child_in_the_garden.htm WilliamCronon.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118100712/http://www.williamcronon.net/handouts/460_handout_15_child_in_the_garden.htm |date=2010-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Botsford Comstock, the head of the Department of Nature Study at Cornell University, was a prominent figure in the nature study movement. She wrote the Handbook for Nature Study in 1911 which used nature to educate children on cultural values.&lt;ref name="Cronon"/&gt; Comstock and the other leaders of the movement, such as Liberty Hyde Bailey, helped Nature Study garner tremendous amounts of support from community leaders, teachers, and scientists to change the science curriculum for children across the United States.

A new type of environmental education, Conservation Education, emerged as a result of the Great Depression and [[Dust Bowl]] during the 1920s and 1930s. Conservation Education dealt with the natural world in a drastically different way from Nature Study because it focused on rigorous scientific training rather than natural history.&lt;ref name="Cronon"/&gt; Conservation Education was a major scientific management and planning tool that helped solve social, economic, and environmental problems during this time period.

The modern environmental education movement, which gained significant momentum in the late 1960s and early 1970s, stems from Nature Study and Conservation Education. During this time period, many events – such as Civil Rights, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War – placed Americans at odds with one another and the U.S. government. However, as more people began to fear the fallout from radiation, the chemical pesticides mentioned in Rachel Carson’s [[Silent Spring]], and the significant amounts of air pollution and waste, the public’s concern for their health and the health of their natural environment led to a unifying phenomenon known as [[environmentalism]]. Environmental education was born of the realization that solving complex local and global problems cannot be accomplished by politicians and experts alone, but requires "the support and active participation of an informed public in their various roles as consumers, voters, employers, and business and community leaders." &lt;ref&gt;Canadian Environmental Grantmakers Network. 2006. "Environmental Education in Canada: An overview for grantmakers," Toronto: ON. http://www.cegn.org/english/home/documents/EEBrief_Eng.pdf, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first articles about environmental education as a new movement appeared in the ''[[Phi Delta Kappan]]'' in 1969, authored by [[James A. Swan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Swan | first1 = J.A. | year = 1969 | title = The challenge of environmental education | url = | journal = Phi Delta Kappan | volume = 51 | issue = | pages = 26–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A definition of "Environmental Education" first appeared in ''[[The Journal of Environmental Education]]'' in 1969, written by [[William B. Stapp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stapp | first1 = W.B. | display-authors = etal   | year = 1969 | title = The Concept of Environmental Education | url = http://www.hiddencorner.us/html/PDFs/The_Concept_of_EE.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Journal of Environmental Education | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 30–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stapp later went on to become the first Director of Environmental Education for [[UNESCO]], and then the [[Global Rivers International Network]].

Ultimately, the first [[Earth Day]] on April 22, 1970 – a national teach-in about environmental problems – paved the way for the modern environmental education movement. Later that same year, President Nixon passed the National Environmental Education Act, which was intended to incorporate environmental education into K-12 schools.&lt;ref name="EElink.net"&gt;[http://eelink.net/eetap/info110a.pdf EElink.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611235103/http://eelink.net/eetap/info110a.pdf |date=2010-06-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in 1971, the National Association for Environmental Education (now known as the [[North_American_Association_for_Environmental_Education | North American Association for Environmental Education]]) was created to improve environmental literacy by providing resources to teachers and promoting environmental education programs.

Internationally, environmental education gained recognition when the UN Conference on the Human Environment held in Stockholm, Sweden, in 1972, declared environmental education must be used as a tool to address global environmental problems. The United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) and [[United Nations Environment Program]] ([[UNEP]]) created three major declarations that have guided the course of environmental education.

In 2002, the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development 2005-2014 (UNDESD) was formed as a way to reconsider, excite, and change approaches to acting positively on global challenges. The Commission on Education and Communication (CEC) helped support the work of the UNDESD by composing a backbone structure for education for sustainability, which contained five major components. The components are "Imagining a better future", "Critical thinking and reflection", "Participation in decision making" and "Partnerships, and Systemic thinking"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=333458c3-7455-4976-862f-82bc3305f1b6@sdc-v-sessmgr03&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#AN=98939066&amp;db=aph|title=Learning engagement and environmental education for sustainability: EBSCOhost|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

On June 9-14 2013, the seventh World Environmental Education Congress was held in Marrakesh, Morocco. The overall theme of the conference was "'''Environmental education and issues in cities and rural areas: seeking greater harmony'''”, and incorporated 11 different areas of concern. The World Environmental Education Congress had 2,400 members, representing over 150 countries. This meeting was the first time ever that it had been held in an Arab country, and was put together by two different organizations, the Mohamed VI Foundation for Environmental Protection and the World Environmental Education Congress Permanent Secretariat in Italy. Topics addressed at the congress include stressing the importance of environmental education and its role to empower, establishing partnerships to promote environmental education, how to mainstream environmental and sustainability, and even how to make universities "greener".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=7th World Environmental Education Congress - Summary|url=https://wedocs.unep.org/bitstream/handle/20.500.11822/12206/WEEC_7_Congress_summary.pdf?amp%3BisAllowed=&amp;sequence=1|journal=7th World Environmental Education Congress|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stockholm Declaration===
June 5–16, 1972 - The [[Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]]. The document was made up of 7 proclamations and 26 principles "to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment."

===Belgrade Charter===
October 13–22, 1975 - The Belgrade Charter&lt;ref&gt;The Belgrade Charter, Adopted by the UNESCO-UNEP International Environmental Workshop, October 13–22, 1975. http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0001/000177/017772eb.pdf accessed 3 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; was the outcome of the International Workshop on Environmental Education held in Belgrade, Jugoslavia (now Serbia). The Belgrade Charter was built upon the [[Stockholm Declaration]] and adds goals, objectives, and guiding principles of environmental education programs. It defines an audience for environmental education, which includes the general public.

===Tbilisi Declaration===
October 14–26, 1977 - The [[Tbilisi]] Declaration "noted the unanimous accord in the important role of environmental education in the preservation and improvement of the world's environment, as well as in the sound and balanced development of the world's communities." The Tbilisi Declaration updated and clarified The Stockholm Declaration and The Belgrade Charter by including new goals, objectives, characteristics, and guiding principles of environmental education.

Later that decade, in 1977, the Intergovernmental Conference on Environmental Education in Tbilisi, [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] emphasized the role of Environmental Education in preserving and improving the global environment and sought to provide the framework and guidelines for environmental education. The Conference laid out the role, objectives, and characteristics of environmental education, and provided several goals and principles for environmental education.

==About==

Environmental education has been considered an additional or elective subject in much of traditional [[K-12]] [[curriculum]]. At the [[elementary school]] level, environmental education can take the form of [[science]] enrichment curriculum, [[natural history]] field trips, community service projects, and participation in outdoor science schools. EE policies assist schools and organizations in developing and improving environmental education programs that provide citizens with an in-depth understanding of the environment. School related EE policies focus on three main components: curricula, green facilities, and training.

Schools can integrate environmental education into their curricula with sufficient funding from EE policies. This approach – known as using the “environment as an integrating context” for learning – uses the local environment as a framework for teaching state and district education standards. In addition to funding environmental curricula in the classroom, environmental education policies allot the financial resources for hands-on, outdoor learning. These activities and lessons help address and mitigate "[[nature deficit disorder]]", as well as encourage healthier lifestyles.

Green schools, or green facility promotion, are another main component of environmental education policies. Greening school facilities cost, on average, a little less than 2 percent more than creating a traditional school, but payback from these [[energy efficient buildings]] occur within only a few years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthday.net/greenschools Earthday.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental education policies help reduce the relatively small burden of the initial start-up costs for green schools. Green school policies also provide grants for modernization, renovation, or repair of older school facilities. Additionally, healthy food options are also a central aspect of green schools. These policies specifically focus on bringing freshly prepared food, made from high-quality, locally grown ingredients into schools.

In [[secondary school]], environmental curriculum can be a focused subject within the sciences or is a part of student interest groups or clubs. At the undergraduate and graduate level, it can be considered its own field within education, environmental studies, environmental science and policy, ecology, or human/cultural ecology programs.

Environmental education is not restricted to in-class lesson plans. Children can learn about the environment in many ways. Experiential lessons in the school yard, field trips to national parks, after-school green clubs, and school-wide sustainability projects help make the environment an easily accessible topic. Furthermore, celebration of [[Earth Day]] or participation in EE week (run through the National Environmental Education Foundation) can help further environmental education. Effective programs promote a holistic approach and lead by example, using sustainable practices in the school to encourage students and parents to bring environmental education into their home.

The final aspect of environmental education policies involves training individuals to thrive in a sustainable society. In addition to building a strong relationship with nature, citizens must have the skills and knowledge to succeed in a 21st-century workforce. Thus, environmental education policies fund both teacher training and worker training initiatives. Teachers train to effectively teach and incorporate environmental studies. On the other hand, the current workforce must be trained or re-trained so they can adapt to the new green economy. Environmental education policies that fund training programs are critical to educating citizens to prosper in a sustainable society.

== In the United States ==

Following the 1970s, non-governmental organizations that focused on environmental education continued to form and grow, the number of teachers implementing environmental education in their classrooms increased, and the movement gained stronger political backing. A critical move forward came when the United States Congress passed the [[National Environmental Education Act]] of 1990, which placed the Office of Environmental Education in the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] and allowed the EPA to create environmental education initiatives at the federal level.

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has their own definition of what environmental education should be and it is as follows. "Environmental education is a process that allows individuals to explore environmental issues, engage in problem solving, and take action to improve the environment. As a result, individuals develop a deeper understanding of environmental issues and have the skills to make informed and responsible decisions." The EPA also has a list of the components of what should be gained from EE.

* Awareness and sensitivity to the environment and environmental challenges
* Knowledge and understanding of the environment and environmental challenges
* Attitudes of concern for the environment and motivation to improve or maintain environmental quality
* Skills to identify and help resolve environmental challenges
* Participation in activities that lead to the resolution of environmental challenges&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/education/what-environmental-education|title=What is Environmental Education? {{!}} US EPA|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29|date=2012-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the EPA Environmental Education (EE) Grant Program, public schools, communities agencies, and NGO’s are eligible to receive federal funding for local educational projects that reflect the EPA’s priorities: air quality, water quality, chemical safety, and public participation among the communities.

In the United States some of the antecedents of environmental education were the Nature Study movement, conservation education and school camping. Nature studies integrated academic approach with outdoor exploration (Roth, 1978). Conservation education raised awareness about the misuse of natural resources and the need for their preservation. [[George Perkins Marsh]] discoursed on humanity’s integral part of the natural world. Governmental agencies such as the [[U.S. Forest Service]] and the EPA supported conservation efforts. Conservation ideals still guide environmental education today. School camping was exposure to the environment and use of resources outside of the classroom for educational purposes. The legacies of these antecedents are still present in the evolving arena of environmental education.

== Obstacles ==

A study of Ontario teachers explored obstacles to environmental education.&lt;ref name="Tan &amp; Pedretti, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=M.|last2=Pedretti|first2=E.|year=2010|title=Negotiating the complexities of environmental education: A study of Ontario teachers|url=|journal=[[Canadian Journal of Science, Mathematics and Technology Education]]|volume=10|issue=1|pages=61–78|doi=10.1080/14926150903574320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an internet-based survey questionnaire, 300 K-12 teachers from Ontario, Canada responded. Based on the results of the survey, the most significant challenges identified by the sample of Ontario teachers include over-crowded curriculum, lack of resources, low priority of environmental education in schools, limited access to the outdoors, student apathy to environmental issues, and the controversial nature of sociopolitical action.&lt;ref name="Tan &amp; Pedretti, 2010"/&gt;

An influential article by Stevenson (2007) outlines conflicting goals of environmental education and traditional schooling.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevenson|first1=R. B.|year=2007|title=Schooling and environmental education: Contradictions in purpose and practice|url=|journal=Environmental Education Research|volume=13|issue=2|pages=139–153|doi=10.1080/13504620701295726}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stevenson (2007), the recent critical and action orientation of environmental education creates a challenging task for schools. Contemporary environmental education strives to transform values that underlie decision making from ones that aid environmental (and human) degradation to those that support a sustainable planet.&lt;ref name="Tanner, 1974"&gt;Tanner, R.T. 1974. "Ecology, environment and education," ''[[Lincoln, NE, Professional Educators Publications]]''&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasts with the traditional purpose of schools of conserving the existing social order by reproducing the norms and values that currently dominate environmental decision making.&lt;ref name= "Stevenson, 2007"/&gt; Confronting this contradiction is a major challenge to environmental education teachers.

Additionally, the dominant narrative that all environmental educators have an agenda can present difficulties in expanding reach. It is said that an environmental educator is one "who uses information and educational processes to help people analyze the merits of the many and varied points of view usually present on a given environmental issues."&lt;ref&gt;Hug, J. (1977). Two hats. In H. R. Hungerford, W. J. Bluhm, T. L. Volk, &amp; J. M. Ramsey (Eds.), ''Essential Readings in Environmental Education'' (pp. 47). Champaign, IL: Stipes Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Greater efforts must be taken to train educators on the importance of staying within the profession's substantive structure, and in informing the general public on the profession's intention to empower fully informed decision making.

Another obstacle facing the implementation of environmental education lies the quality of education itself. Charles Sayan, the executive director of the Ocean Conservation Society, represents alternate views and critiques on environmental education in his new book ''The Failure of Environmental Education (And How We Can Fix It).'' In a ''Yale Environment 360'' interview, Sayan discusses his book and outlines several flaws within environmental education, particularly its failed efforts to “reach its potential in fighting climate change, biodiversity loss, and environmental degradation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520265394|title=The Failure of Environmental Education (And How We Can Fix It)|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that environmental education is not “keeping pace with environmental degradation” and encourages structural reform by increasing student engagement as well as improving relevance of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://e360.yale.edu/features/green_failure_whats_wrong_with_environmental_education|title=Green Failure: What's Wrong With Environmental Education? - Yale E360|last=Nijhuis|first=Michelle|date=2011|website=e360.yale.edu|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These same critiques are discussed in Stewart Hudson’s BioScience paper, “Challenges for Environmental Education: Issues and Ideas for the 21st Century”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HUDSON|first=STEWART J.|date=2001-04-01|title=Challenges for Environmental Education: Issues and Ideas for the 21st Century|journal=BioScience|language=en|volume=51|issue=4|pages=283|doi=10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0283:cfeeia]2.0.co;2|issn=0006-3568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==

A movement that has progressed since the relatively recent founding (1960s) of environmental education in industrial societies has transported the participant from nature appreciation and awareness to education for an ecologically sustainable future. This trend may be viewed as a microcosm of how many environmental education programs seek to first engage participants through developing a sense of nature appreciation which then translates into actions that affect conservation and sustainability.

Programs range from New York to California, including Life Lab at University of California, Santa Cruz, as well as Cornell University in Ithaca. [http://www.gardenmosaics.cornell.edu/]

== Environmental Education in the Global South ==
Environmentalism has also began to make waves in the development of the global South, as the “[[First World]]” takes on the responsibility of helping [[Developing country|developing countries]] to combat environmental issues produced and prolonged by conditions of poverty. Unique to environmental education in the Global South is its particular focus on sustainable development. This goal has been a part of international agenda since the 1900’s, with the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organizations (UNESCO) and the Earth Council Alliance (ECA) at the forefront of pursuing sustainable development in the south.

The 1977 Tbilisi intergovernmental conference played a key role in the development of  outcome of the conference was the Tbilisi Declaration, a unanimous accord which “constitutes the framework, principles, and guidelines for environmental education at all levels—local, national, regional, and international—and for all age groups both inside and outside the formal school system” recommended as a criteria for implementing environmental education. The Declaration was established with the intention of increasing environmental stewardship, awareness and behavior, which paved the way for the rise of modern environmental education.

After the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, over 80 National Councils for Sustainable Development in developing countries were created between 1992-1998 to aid in compliance of international sustainability goals and encourage “creative solutions”.

In 1993, the Earth Council Alliance released the ''Treaty on environmental education for sustainable societies and global responsibility'', sparking discourse on environmental education. The Treaty, in 65 statements, outlines the role of environmental education in facilitating sustainable development through all aspects of democratized participation and provides a methodology for the Treaty’s signatories. It has been instrumentally utilized in expanding the field towards the global South, wherein the discourse of “environmental education for sustainable development” recognizes a need to include human population dynamics in EE and emphasizes “aspects related to contemporary economic realities and by placing greater emphasis on concerns for planetary solidarity”. Even as a necessary tool for the proliferation of environmental stewardship, environmental education implemented in the South varies and addresses environmental issues in relation to their impact different communities and specific community needs. Whereas in the developed global North where the environmentalist sentiments are centered around conservation without taking into consideration “the needs of people living within communities”, the global South must push forth a conservation agenda that parallels with social, economic, and political development. The role of environmental education in the South is centered around potential economic growth in development projects, as explicitly stated by the UNESCO, to apply environmental education for sustainable development through a "creative and effective use of human potential and all forms of capital to ensure rapid and more equitable economic growth, with minimal impact on the environment".

Moving into the 21st century, EE was furthered by United Nations as a part of the 2000 Millennium Development Goals to improve the planet by 2015. The MDGs included global efforts to end extreme poverty, work towards gender equality, access to education, and sustainable development to name a few. Although the MDGs produced great outcomes, its objectives were not met, and MDGs were soon were soon replaced by Sustainable Development Goals. A “universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity”, SDGs became the new face of global priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals.html|title=Sustainable Development Goals|website=UNDP|language=en|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These new goals incorporated objectives from MDGs yet incorporated a necessary environmental framework to “address key systemic barriers to sustainable development such as inequality, unsustainable consumption patterns, weak institutional capacity and environmental degradation that the MDGs neglected”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simkiss|first=D.|date=2015-07-24|title=The Millennium Development Goals are Dead; Long Live the Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Journal of Tropical Pediatrics|language=en|volume=61|issue=4|pages=235–237|doi=10.1093/tropej/fmv048|pmid=26209862|issn=0142-6338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends==

One of the current trends within environmental education seeks to move from an approach of [[ideology]] and [[activism]] to one that allows students to make informed decisions and take action based on experience as well as data. Within this process, environmental curricula have progressively been integrated into governmental education standards. Some environmental educators find this movement distressing and move away from the original political and activist approach to environmental education while others find this approach more valid and accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Failure of Environmental Education (and How We Can Fix It)|last=Blumstein|first=Daniel T|last2=Saylan|first2=Charlie|date=2007-04-17|journal=PLoS Biology|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050120|others=|volume=5|pages=e120|language=en|issn=1545-7885|pmc=1847843|pmid=17439304}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, many educational institutions are encouraging students to take an active role in environmental education and stewardship at their institutions. They know that "to be successful, greening initiatives require both grassroots support from the student body and top down support from high-level campus administrators."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reynolds|first1=Heather|last2=Brondizio|first2=Eduardo|last3=Robinson|first3=Jennifer|last4=Karpa|first4=John|last5=Gross|first5=Briana|title=Teaching Environmental Literacy|date=2010-01-11|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=9780253221506|pages=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmental Education is also being funded through the [[Every Student Succeeds Act]]. Under Title IV, Part A of ESSA, it states that Environmental Education is an enrichment activity for students which is eligible for funding under a new grants program. The program gives a “well-rounded” education as well as access to student health and safety programs. Under Title Iv, Part B, it states that environmental literacy programs are also eligible for funding through the 21st Century Community Learning Centers Program. The funds that are available for both parts are block granted to the states using the Title I formula. In the FY2018 budget, Titles IVA and IVB were both given $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion. For title IVA, this is a $700 million raise from the 2017 budget which makes the 2018-2019 school year the most availability to environmental education ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://cdn.naaee.org/sites/default/files/ee_in_essa_2018.pdf|title=Environmental Education in the Every Student Succeeds Act|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Renewable Energy Education ==
[[Renewable energy]] education (REE) is a relatively new field of education. The overall objectives of REE pertain to giving a working knowledge and understanding of concepts, facts, principles and technologies for gathering the renewable sources of energy. Based on these objectives, the role of a renewable energy education programs should be informative, investigative, educative, and imaginative. REE should be taught with the world's population in mind as the world will run out of [[Non-renewable resource|non-renewable resources]] within the next century. Renewable energy education is also being brought to political leaders as a means of getting more sustainable development to occur around the globe. This is happening in the hopes that it will uproot millions of people out of poverty and into a better quality of life in many countries .Renewable energy education is also about bringing awareness of climate change to the general public as well as an understanding of the current renewable energy technologies. An understanding of the new technologies is imperative to get them stream-lined and accepted by the vast majority of the public&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2014-06-01|title=Renewable energy education: A global status review|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032114001762|journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews|language=en|volume=34|pages=300–324|doi=10.1016/j.rser.2014.02.039|issn=1364-0321|last1=Kandpal|first1=Tara C.|last2=Broman|first2=Lars}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''FSU Young Scholars Program (YSP)''' is a six-week residential [[science]] and [[mathematics]] summer program for 40 [[Florida]] [[Secondary education in the United States|high school students]] with significant potential for careers in the fields of [[science]], [[technology]], [[engineering]], and [[mathematics]]. The program was developed in 1983 and is currently administered by the Office of Science Teaching Activities in the [[Florida State University College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]] at [[Florida State University]].

==Academic program==
Each young scholar attends a total of three courses in the fields of mathematics, science, and computer programming. The courses are designed specifically for this program—they are neither high school nor college courses.

==Research==
Each student who attends YSP is assigned an Independent Research Project (IRP) based on his or her interests. Students join the research teams of [[Florida State University|FSU]] professors, participating in [[scientific research]] for two days each week.  The fields of study available range from [[robotics]], [[molecular biology]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]], [[physics]], to [[zoology]]. At the conclusion of the program, students present their projects in an [[academic conference]], documenting their findings and explaining their projects to both students and faculty.

==Faculty==
The program is co-directed by Dr. Erica Staehling, Barbara Shoplock, and Teresa Callahan, members of the Office of Science Teaching Activities, [[Florida State University]]. Instructional faculty includes Dr. Steve Blumsack, Emeritus Professor of [[Mathematics]]; Dr. Dan Oberlin, Professor of [[Mathematics]]; Drs. Harrison Prosper and Horst Wahl, Professors of [[Physics]]; and Dr. Lloyd Epstein, Professor of [[biology|Biological Science]]. Twenty additional Florida State science and engineering faculty members mentor the students in their independent research projects.

==Selection process==
YSP admits students who have completed the eleventh grade in a Florida [[public high school|public]] or [[private high school]].  A few exceptionally qualified and mature tenth graders have been selected in past years, though this is quite rare.

All applicants must have completed [[Pre-Calculus]] and maintain at least a 3.0 unweighted [[Grading (education)|GPA]] to be considered for acceptance. Additionally, students must have scored at the 90th percentile or better in science or mathematics on a nationally standardized exam, such as the [[SAT]], [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]], [[ACT (test)|ACT]], or [[PLAN (test)|PLAN]].  Students are required to submit an application package, including [[Transcript (education)|high school transcripts]] and a letter of recommendation.

Selection is extremely competitive, as there are typically over 200 highly qualified applicants competing for only 40 positions.  The majority of past participants graduated in the top ten of their respective high school classes, with over 25% of students entering their senior year ranked first in their class.  The average [[PSAT/NMSQT|PSAT]] score of past young scholars was in the 97th percentile in math and 94th percentile in critical reading nationally.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5899">In [[oncology]], the fact that one round of [[chemotherapy]] does not kill all the [[cell (biology)|cell]]s in a [[tumor]] is a poorly understood phenomenon called '''fractional kill''', or '''fractional cell kill'''.

The fractional kill hypothesis states that a defined chemotherapy concentration, applied for a defined time period, will kill a constant fraction of the cells in a population, independent of the absolute number of cells.&lt;ref&gt;Berenbaum, M. C. (1972). "In vivo determination of the fractional kill of human tumor cells by chemotherapeutic agents." Cancer Chemother Rep 56(5): 563-71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skipper, H. E. (1979). "Historic milestones in cancer biology: a few that are important in cancer treatment (revisited)." Semin Oncol 6(4): 506-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chabner&gt;Chabner, B. and D. L. Longo (2006). Cancer Chemotherapy and Biotherapy: Principles and Practice. Philadelphia, Lippincott Willians &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;  In solid tumors, poor access of the tumor to the drug can limit the fraction of tumor cells killed, but the validity of the fractional kill hypothesis has also been established in animal models of leukemia, as well as in human leukemia and lymphoma, where drug access is less of an issue.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;

Because only a fraction of the cells die with each treatment, repeated doses must be administered to continue to reduce the size of the tumor.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  Current chemotherapy regimens apply drug treatment in cycles, with the frequency and duration of treatments limited by toxicity to the patient.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;  The goal is to reduce the tumor population to zero with successive fractional kills.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;  For example, assuming a 99% kill per cycle of chemotherapy, a tumor of 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; cells would be reduced to less than one cell with six treatment cycles: 10&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; * 0.01&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 1.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;  However, the tumor can also re-grow during the intervals between treatments, limiting the net reduction of each fractional kill.&lt;ref name=skeel&gt;Skeel, R. T. (2003). Handbook of Cancer Chemotherapy, Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cited cause of fractional killing: cell cycle effects==

The fractional killing of tumors in response to treatment is assumed to be due to the [[cell cycle]] specificity of chemotherapy drugs.&lt;ref name=chabner/&gt;&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  [[Cytarabine]], a DNA-synthesis inhibitor also known as ara-C, is cited as the classic cell cycle phase-specific agent.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  Chemotherapy dosing schedules have been optimized based on the fact that cytarabine is only expected to be effective in the [[S phase|DNA synthesis (S) phase]] of the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  Consistent with this, leukemia patients respond better to cytarabine treatments given every 12 hours rather than every 24 hours.  This finding that can be explained by the fact that S-phase in these leukemia cells lasts 18–20 hours, allowing some cells to escape the cytotoxic effect of the drug if it is given every 24 hours.&lt;ref name=skeel/&gt;  However, alternative explanations are possible, as described below.

==Lack of cell cycle effect in drugs documented to be cell cycle phase specific==

Very little direct information is available on whether cells undergo [[apoptosis]] from a certain point in the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=cotter&gt;Cotter, T. G., J. M. Glynn, et al. (1992). "The induction of apoptosis by chemotherapeutic agents occurs in all phases of the cell cycle." Anticancer Res 12(3): 773-9.&lt;/ref&gt;  One study which did address this topic used [[flow cytometry]] or elutriation of synchronized cells treated with [[actinomycin D1]], [[camptothecin]], or [[aphidicolin]], each of which had been documented to exert its effects in a particular phase of the cell cycle.&lt;ref name=cotter/&gt;  Surprisingly, the authors found that each of the agents was able to induce apoptosis in all phases of the cell cycle, suggesting that the mechanism through which the drugs induce apoptosis may be independent of the drugs’ biochemical targets.&lt;ref name=cotter/&gt;  In fact, a trace through the literature on the S-phase specificity of cytarabine leads to studies that simply assume S-phase specificity based on cytarabine’s reported site of biochemical action,&lt;ref&gt;Skipper, H. E., F. M. Schabel, Jr., et al. (1970). "Implications of biochemical, cytokinetic, pharmacologic, and toxicologic relationships in the design of optimal therapeutic schedules." Cancer Chemother Rep 54(6): 431-50.&lt;/ref&gt; which the later papers reference.  The lack of a cell cycle effect for camptothecin has also been reported recently in a live-cell microscopy study.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A. A., N. Geva-Zatorsky, et al. (2008). "Dynamic proteomics of individual cancer cells in response to a drug." Science 322(5907): 1511-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cell-to-cell variation in protein levels==

A recent paper by Spencer et al.&lt;ref name=spencer&gt;Spencer, S. L., S. Gaudet, et al. (2009). "Non-genetic origins of cell-to-cell variability in TRAIL-induced apoptosis." Nature.   http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature08012.html.&lt;/ref&gt; raises the possibility that cell-to-cell variability in protein concentrations may contribute to fractional killing in the case of treatment with [[TRAIL]] (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand).  TRAIL is a ligand native to the human body that is currently being developed as a cancer treatment.  Spencer et al. observed fractional killing at a single cell level in several cell lines, even in genetically identical populations grown in homogeneous environments.  This paper ruled out the conventional explanation (cell cycle effects) in two of these cell lines, and provided evidence supporting the hypothesis that random variation in cellular initial conditions causes some cells to die while allowing others to survive.

[[File:Eric Enstrom - Grace - bw.jpg|thumb|300px|Photograph with window light added to original.]]
'''''Grace''''' is a [[photograph]] by [[Eric Enstrom]]. It depicts an elderly man with hands folded, saying [[Grace (prayer)|a prayer over a table]] with a simple meal. In [[82nd Minnesota Legislature|2002]], an act of the [[Minnesota State Legislature]] established it as the state photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mn.gov/portal/about-minnesota/state-symbols/photograph.jsp |title=''Grace'', official state photograph |publisher=[[State of Minnesota]] |accessdate=Feb 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and background==
The original photograph was taken at Enstrom's photography studio in [[Bovey, Minnesota]]. Most sources indicate 1918 as the year, though Enstrom's daughter Rhoda, born in 1917, claimed to remember being present when the photograph was taken, which might have been around 1920. The man depicted in the photograph is Charles Wilden, who earned a meager living as a [[peddler]] and lived in a [[sod house]]. While the photograph conveys a sense of piety, the book seen in the photo is actually a [[dictionary]] not a [[the Bible|Bible]],{{disputed inline|date=June 2018}} and local stories about Wilden "centered more around drinking and not accomplishing very much."&lt;ref name="grandforks"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lee |first1=Stephen J. |title=Man in famous ''Grace'' photo mystifies historians |url=http://www.bakkentoday.com/event/article/id/230720/publisher_ID/40/ |work=Grand Folks Herald |date=27 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101163418/http://www.bakkentoday.com/event/article/id/230720/publisher_ID/40 |archivedate=1 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What happened to Wilden after the photograph is unknown. In 1926, he was paid $5 by Enstrom in return for waiving his rights to the photograph; he disappeared thereafter. After the photograph became popular Enstrom attempted to track Wilden down but was unsuccessful. Numerous family members and local historians have also attempted to determine what became of Wilden but have not been able to locate definitive evidence.&lt;ref name="grandforks" /&gt;

Enstrom first licensed the photograph to [[Augsburg Fortress]] in 1930. In the 1940s, his daughter, Rhoda Nyberg, [[hand-colouring of photographs|colorized]] the photo by hand. This version was featured in prints produced during the 1940s onward and became the more widespread and popularly known version of the photo.&lt;ref name=startribune&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Paul|title=Iron Range artist brought ''Grace'' photo to fame|url=http://www.startribune.com/iron-range-artist-brought-grace-photo-to-fame/140587173/|work=Minneapolis Star-Tribune|date=27 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enstrom earned a modest sum from the photograph for the remainder of his life until his death in 1968. Nyberg died in 2012.&lt;ref name="grandforks"/&gt;&lt;ref name=startribune/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 2014 the stage play ''Picturing Grace'' premiered,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Picturing Grace' has successful opening, looks forward to future audiences|url = http://www.grandrapidsmn.com/news/picturing-grace-has-successful-opening-looks-forward-to-future-audiences/article_046a0012-5490-11e4-b428-bb29a33f4e87.html|website = Grand Rapids Herald-Review|access-date = 2016-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which presents a dramatized retelling of the story behind the photograph, its photographer and subject. The play premiered in [[Itasca County, Minnesota|Itasca County]], the same region in which the photograph was captured.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="64745">The '''ISASMELT''' process is an energy-efficient [[smelting]] process that was jointly developed from the 1970s to the 1990s by [[Mount Isa Mines]] Limited (a subsidiary of [[MIM Holdings Limited]] and now part of [[Glencore]] plc) and the Australian government’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation ("[[CSIRO]]"). It has relatively low capital and operating costs for a smelting process.

ISASMELT technology has been applied to lead, copper, and nickel smelting, and by 2013 fifteen plants were in operation in ten countries, with another five in various stages of development.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/Installations.aspx List of Isasmelt installations]&lt;/ref&gt; The installed capacity of the operating plants in 2013 was over 8 million tonnes per year ('''t/y''') of feed materials, with additional capacity to come on line in 2013 and 2014.&lt;ref name = "XT"&gt;Information provided courtesy of Xstrata Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

Smelters based on the copper ISASMELT process are among the lowest-cost copper smelters in the world.&lt;ref name = "Bill, 2002"&gt;J L Bill, T E Briffa, A S Burrows, C R Fountain, D Retallick, J M I Tuppurainen, J S Edwards, and P Partington, "Isasmelt—Mount Isa copper smelter progress update," in: ''Sulfide Smelting 2002'', Eds R L Stephens and H Y Sohn (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania), 2002, 181–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ISASMELT Furnace==
An ISASMELT furnace is an upright-cylindrical shaped steel vessel that is lined with refractory bricks.&lt;ref name = "Brochure"&gt;Xstrata Technology, "ISASMELT – High productivity, clean smelting," ISASMELT brochure, 2012. Available from: [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Documents/XTT_1603_ISASMELT_Broch_V2_SR-2.pdf Isasmelt brochure]. Accessed 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; There is a molten bath of slag, matte or metal (depending on the application) at the bottom of the furnace. A steel lance is lowered into the bath through a hole in the roof of the furnace, and air or oxygen-enriched air that is injected through the lance into the bath causes vigorous agitation of the bath.

[[File:Cut-away view of an Isasmelt furnace.png|thumbnail|Cut-away view of an Isasmelt furnace. Image courtesy of Xstrata Technology.]]
Mineral concentrates or materials for recycling are dropped into the bath through another hole in the furnace roof or, in some cases, injected down the lance. These feed materials react with the oxygen in the injected gas, resulting in an intensive reaction in a small volume (relative to other smelting technologies).

ISASMELT lances contain one or more devices called "swirlers" that cause the injected gas to spin within the lance, forcing it against the lance wall, cooling it. The swirler consists of curved vanes around a central pipe forming an annular flow. &lt;ref name ="Abulnaga,1989"&gt; B E Abulnaga, "Air Pressure Measurements on the Isasmelt Copper Smelter at Mount Isa - Research paper No VI6-480 - Clayton, Vic - CSIRO Division of Mineral and Process Engineering, (Dec 1989), &lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to minimize pressure losses changing the angle from axial to tangential thus creating a strong vortex &lt;ref name = "Abulnaga,1990"&gt;B.E Abulnaga, Australian Patent Application 1990PK0047 "A smelter lance swirler , Applicant CSIRO (1990) &lt;/ref&gt;. The vortex helps mix liquids and solids with oxygen in the bath.&lt;ref name = Hooper,1992&gt;J Hooper, B.E. Abulnaga, "The Design and Experimental Evaluation of an Aerodynamic Swirler for a Top Injection Lance System," Research report No VI6-555 - Clayton,Vic: CSIRO Division of Mineral and Process Engineering, (1992). &lt;/ref&gt; The cooling effect results in a layer of slag "freezing" on the outside of the lance. This layer of solid slag protects the lance from the high temperatures inside the furnace. The tip of the lance that is submerged in the bath eventually wears out, and the worn lance is easily replaced with a new one when necessary. The worn tips are subsequently cut off and a new tip welded onto the lance body before it is returned to the furnace.

ISASMELT furnaces typically operate in the range of 1000–1200&amp;nbsp;°C, depending on the application.&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"&gt;W J Errington, J H Fewings, V P Keran and W T Denholm, "The Isasmelt lead smelting process," ''Transactions of the Institution of Mining and Metallurgy (Section C: Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy)'', 96, (1987), C1–C6.&lt;/ref&gt; The refractory bricks that form the internal lining of the furnace protect the steel shell from the heat inside the furnace.

The products are removed from the furnace through one or more "tap holes" in a process called "tapping". This can be either continuous removal or in batches, with the tap holes being blocked with clay at the end of a tap, and then reopened by drilling or with a thermic lance when it is time for the next tap.

The products are allowed to separate in a settling vessel, such as a rotary holding furnace or an electric furnace.

While smelting sulfide concentrates, most of the energy needed to heat and melt the feed materials is derived from the reaction of oxygen with the sulfur and iron in the concentrate. However, a small amount of supplemental energy is required. ISASMELT furnaces can use a variety of fuels, including coal, coke, petroleum coke, oil and natural gas. The solid fuel can be added through the top of the furnace with the other feed materials, or it can be injected down the lance. Liquid and gaseous fuels are injected down the lance.

==Advantages of the ISASMELT process==
[[File:Isasmelt feed chute.png|thumbnail|An ISASMELT furnace is typically fed with damp concentrate falling from a conveyor belt into the furnace. Image courtesy of Xstrata Technology.]]

The advantages of the ISASMELT process include:

* High productivity with a small footprint: Xstrata's copper smelter in Mount Isa treats over 1 million t/y of copper concentrate through a single furnace 3.75 m in diameter.&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt; The small footprint makes the process well suited to retrofitting to existing smelters where there are significant space constraints&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"&gt;R R Bhappu, K H Larson and R D Tunis, "Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation – smelter modernization project summary and status", in: ''EPD Congress 1994'', Ed. G Warren (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1993), 555–570.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"&gt;Y Li and P S Arthur, "Yunnan Copper Corporation's new smelter – China's first ISASMELT", in: ''Yazawa International Symposium, Metallurgical and Materials Processing: Principles and Technologies, Volume II: High-temperature metals production'', Eds. F Kongoli, K Itagaki, C Yamauchi and H Y Sohn (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 2003), 371–384.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Simple operation: the ISASMELT furnace does not require extensive feed preparation as the feed can be discharged from a belt conveyor directly into the furnace&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;
* high energy efficiency: installing an ISASMELT furnace in the Mount Isa copper smelter reduced energy consumption by over 80% (through better use of the inherent energy contained in the sulfide concentrate) compared with the roaster and reverberatory furnaces previously used there&lt;ref name = "Bill, 2002"/&gt;
* Flexibility in feed types: ISASMELT furnaces have been used to smelt copper, lead and nickel concentrates with a wide range of compositions,&lt;ref&gt;W G Davenport, "Copper extraction from the 60s into the 21st century", in: ''Proceedings of the Copper 99–Cobre 99 International Conference. Volume I—Plenary Lectures/Movement of Copper and Industry Outlook/Copper Applications and Fabrication,'' Eds G A Eltringham, N L Piret and M Sahoo (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 55–79.&lt;/ref&gt; including high levels of magnetite,&lt;ref name = "Coulter"&gt;M D Coulter and C R Fountain, "The Isasmelt process for copper smelting", in: ''Non-ferrous Smelting Symposium, Port Pirie, South Australia, September 1989'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne), 237–240.&lt;/ref&gt; and secondary materials, such as copper scrap and lead-acid battery paste&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"&gt;P S Arthur and S P Hunt, "ISASMELT – 25 years of continuous evolution", in: ''The John Floyd International Symposium on Sustainable Developments in Metals Processing, Melbourne, 3–6 July 2005'', Eds. M Nilmani and W J Rankin (NCS Associates (Australia) Pty Ltd, 2005), 73–94.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flexibility in fuel types: ISASMELT furnaces can operate with a variety of fuels, including lump coal of varying ranks, coke (lump or fine), petroleum coke, oil (including recycled oil), natural gas, and liquid petroleum gas, depending on which is the most economic at the smelter's location&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt;
* High turn-down ratio: the feed rate to a single ISASMELT installation can easily be scaled up or down, depending on the availability of concentrate and the needs of the smelter
* Low feed carry over: ISASMELT furnaces typically lose about 1% of the feed as carry-over with the waste gas, meaning that there is less material that needs to be returned to the furnace for retreatment&lt;ref name = "Brochure"/&gt;
* Effective containment of fugitive emissions: because the furnace has only two openings at the top, any fugitive emissions can easily be captured&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;
* High elimination of deleterious minor elements: due to the flushing action of the gases injected into the ISASMELT furnace slags, copper ISASMELT furnaces have a high elimination of minor elements, such as bismuth and arsenic, that can have deleterious effects on the properties of the product copper&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 1991"&gt;C R Fountain, M D Coulter and J S Edwards, "Minor element distribution in the copper Isasmelt process", in: ''Copper '91, Volume IV'', Eds. C Díaz, C Landolt, A Luraschi and C J Newman (Pergamon Press: New York, 1991), 359–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
* High sulfur dioxide concentration in the waste gas: the use of oxygen enrichment gives the ISASMELT plants high sulfur dioxide concentrations in the waste gas stream, making acid plants cheaper to build and operate
* Relatively low operating cost: the energy efficiency of the process, the simple feed preparation, the relative lack of moving parts, low feed carry-over rates, low labour requirements and the ease of replacing lances and refractory linings when they are worn give the ISASMELT process relatively low operating costs&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;
* Relatively low capital cost: the simplicity of the construction of the ISASMELT furnaces and the ability to treat concentrate without drying make it cheaper than other smelting processes.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"&gt;L M Samaniego and W T Pino, "Modernization and start-up of the SPCC Ilo smelter", in: ''Cu2007 – Volume III (Book I): The Carlos Díaz Symposium on Pyrometallurgy'', Eds.

==History of the ISASMELT Process==

===Early developmental work (1973–1980)===
The history of the ISASMELT process began with the invention in 1973 of the '''Sirosmelt lance''' by Drs Bill Denholm and John Floyd at the CSIRO.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"&gt;J H Fewings, "Management of Innovation – The ISASMELT process," Presented at the AMIRA ''Innovation in Metal Production'' technical meeting at Mount Isa, Queensland, 3–4 October 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"&gt;J M Floyd and D S Conochie, SIROSMELT – The first ten years, in ''Extractive Metallurgy Symposium'', pp 1–8, The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Melbourne Branch, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The lance was developed as a result of investigations into improved tin-smelting processes, in which it was found that the use of a '''top-entry submerged lance''' would result in greater heat transfer and mass transfer efficiencies.&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt;

The idea of top-entry submerged lances goes back to at least 1902, when such a system was attempted in Clichy, France.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Queensland Government Mining Journal]]'', 15 January 1903, pp 27.&lt;/ref&gt; However, early attempts failed because of the short lives of the lances on submersion in the bath. The Mitsubishi copper smelting process is one alternative approach, wherein lances are used in a furnace, but they are not submerged into the bath. Instead, they blow oxygen-enriched air onto the surface of the slag (top jetting).&lt;ref&gt;T Shibasaki, K Kanamori and M Hayashi, "Development of (sic) large scale Mitsubishi furnace at Naoshima," in ''Proceedings of the Savard/Lee International Symposium on Bath Smelting'', Eds J K Brimacombe, P J Mackey, G J W Kor, C Bickert and M G Ranade (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1992), 147–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a water-cooled, top-jetting lance was the basis of the LD ([[Basic oxygen steelmaking|Linz-Donawitz]]) steelmaking process. This does not produce the same intensity of mixing in the bath as a submerged lance.&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt;

The CSIRO scientists first tried developing a submerged lance system using a water-cooled lance system, but moved to an air-cooled system because "scale up of the water-cooled lance would have been problematic".&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; Introducing any water to a system involving molten metals and slags can result in catastrophic explosions, such as that in the Scunthorpe Steelworks in November 1975 in which 11 men lost their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rediron-steve.blogspot.com.au/2010/11/remembering-1975-scunthorpe-blast.html Remembering the 1975 Scunthorpe blast furnace disaster]. Accessed 14 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of the swirlers in the Sirosmelt lance and forming a splash coating of slag on the lance were the major innovations that led to the successful development of submerged lance smelting.

From 1973, the CSIRO scientists began a series of trials using the Sirosmelt lance to recover metals from industrial slags in Australia, including lead softener slag at the [[Port Pirie#History|Broken Hill Associated Smelters]] in [[Port Pirie]] (1973), tin slag from Associated Tin Smelters in [[Sydney]] (1974), copper converter slag at the [[Port Kembla, New South Wales#Industrial Change|Electrolytic Refining and Smelting]] ("ER&amp;S") [[Port Kembla, New South Wales|Port Kembla]] plant (1975) and copper anode furnace slag at Copper Refineries Limited (another subsidiary of MIM Holdings) in [[Townsville]] (1976) and of copper converter slag in [[Mount Isa]] (1977).&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; The work then proceeded to smelting tin concentrates (1975) and then sulfidic tin concentrates (1977).&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt;

MIM and ER&amp;S jointly funded the 1975 Port Kembla converter slag treatment trials and MIM’s involvement continued with the slag treatment work in Townsville and Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Floyd, 1978"&gt;.J M Floyd, G J Leahy, R L Player and D J Wright, "Submerged combustion technology applied to copper slag treatment," in: ''The Aus.I.M.M. Conference, North Queensland, September 1978'', (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1978), 323–337.&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel with the copper slag treatment work, the CSIRO was continuing to work in tin smelting. Projects included a five tonne ("t") plant for recovering tin from slag being installed at Associated Tin Smelters in 1978, and the first sulfidic smelting test work being done in collaboration with Aberfoyle Limited, in which tin was fumed from pyritic tin ore and from mixed tin and copper concentrates.&lt;ref name = "Denholm"&gt;W T Denholm, "Matte fuming of tin from sulfide concentrates containing tin and copper, in: ''Australia–Japan Extractive Metallurgy Symposium, Sydney, Australia, 1980'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980), 321–333.&lt;/ref&gt; Aberfoyle was investigating the possibility of using the Sirosmelt lance approach to improve the recovery of tin from complex ores, such as its mine at Cleveland, Tasmania, and the Queen Hill ore zone near [[Zeehan, Tasmania|Zeehan]] in [[Tasmania]].&lt;ref name = "Foo"&gt;K A Foo and J M Floyd, "Development of the matte fuming process for tin recovery from sulphide minerals," in: ''Lead–Zinc–Tin ’80: World Symposium on Metallurgy and Environmental Control'', Eds. J M Cigan, T S Mackey and T J O’Keefe (The Metallurgical Society of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1980), 786–800.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Biehl"&gt;R L Biehl, D S Conochie, K A Foo and B W Lightfoot, "Design, construction and commissioning of a 4 tonne/hour matte fuming pilot plant," in ''The Aus.I.M.M. Melbourne Branch, Symposium on Extractive Metallurgy, November 1984'', (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1984), 9–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aberfoyle work led to the construction and operation in late 1980 of a four t/h tin matte fuming pilot plant at the [[Western Mining Corporation]]’s Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter, located to the south of [[Kalgoorlie]], [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name = "Biehl"/&gt;

===Lead ISASMELT development===

====Small-scale work (1978–1983)====
In the early 1970s, the traditional blast furnace and sinter plant technology that was the mainstay of the lead smelting industry was coming under sustained pressure from more stringent environmental requirements, increased energy costs, decreasing metal prices and rising capital and operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt;

Many smelting companies were seeking new processes to replace sinter plants and blast furnaces. Possibilities included the QSL lead smelting process, the Kivcet process, the [[Kaldo converter|Kaldo top-blown rotary converter]], and adapting Outokumpu’s successful copper and nickel flash furnace to lead smelting.&lt;ref&gt;C O Bounds, "Innovative processes: lead-zinc-tin," in: ''1990 Elliott Symposium on Chemical Process Metallurgy'', Eds P J Koros and G R St Pierre (Iron and Steel Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania), 1990, 73–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

MIM was seeking ways to safeguard the future of its Mount Isa lead smelting operations. It did this in two ways:
# working to improve the environmental and operational performance of its existing operations
# investigating new technologies.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt;
MIM investigated new technologies by arranging plant testing of large parcels of Mount Isa lead concentrates for all the then process options except for the Kivcet process. At the same time, it had been aware of the use of top-jetting lances in the Mitsubishi and [[Boliden AB#History|Kaldo]] processes, and of top-entry submerged combustion lance investigations undertaken by [[ASARCO]] Limited (which had a long association with MIM, including being a shareholder in MIM Holdings) in the 1960s. This stimulated MIM’s interest in the Sirosmelt lance, which was seen as a way to produce a robust submerged lance.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt;

Following the copper slag trials of 1976–1978, MIM initiated a joint project with the CSIRO in 1978 to investigate the possibility of applying Sirosmelt lances to lead smelting.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

The work began with computer modelling the equilibrium thermodynamics (1978) and was followed by laboratory bench-scale test work using large alumina silicate crucibles (1978–1979). The results were sufficiently encouraging that MIM built a 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig in Mount Isa. It began operation in September 1980. This was used to develop a two-stage process to produce lead bullion from Mount Isa lead concentrate. The first stage was an oxidation step that removed virtually all the sulfur from the feed, oxidising the contained lead to lead oxide (PbO) that was largely collected in the slag (some was carried out of the furnace as lead oxide fume that was returned for lead recovery). The second stage was a reduction step in which the oxygen was removed from the lead to form lead metal.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

==== The lead ISASMELT pilot plant (1983–1990) ====
Following the 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test work, MIM decided to proceed to install a 5&amp;nbsp;t/h lead ISASMELT pilot plant in its Mount Isa lead smelter. It bought Aberfoyle’s matte fuming furnace and transported it from Kalgoorlie to Mount Isa, where it was rebuilt and commissioned in 1983&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; to demonstrate the first stage of the process in continuous operation and for testing the reduction step using batches of high-lead slag.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"&gt;S P Matthew, G R McKean, R L Player and K E Ramus, "The continuous Isasmelt lead process," in ''Lead-Zinc ’90'', Eds T S Mackey and R D Prengaman (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale Pennsylvania), 1990, 889–901.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the key features of the pilot plant was that it was run by operations’ personnel in the lead smelter as though it was an operations’ plant.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt; The high lead slag produced by the continuous smelting of the lead concentrate was subsequently treated in the sinter plant, thus increasing the production of the lead smelter by up to 17%.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"&gt;P Bartsch, C R Fountain and B Anselmi, "Radio Hill project," in: ''Pyrosem WA'', Eds. E J Grimsey and N D Stockton (Murdoch University Press: Perth, Western Australia, 1990), 232–250.&lt;/ref&gt; This gave the operations’ people ownership of the plant and an incentive to make it work, thus ensuring management and maintenance priority. It also gave MIM assurance that the process simple enough to be operable in a production environment, with normal staff and supervision, and that it was robust enough to withstand normal control excursions.&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt; In addition to the continuous operation of lead concentrate to produce high-lead slag, the pilot plant was used to produce lead metal from batches of the slag,&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt; investigate the wear rates of the furnace’s refractory lining and lances, and initial work aimed at developing a low-pressure version of the Sirosmelt lance. The result was a lance design that allowed operation at significantly lower pressure than the initial values of about 250 kilopascal (gauge) ("kPag"), thus reducing operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

MIM built a second, identical furnace next to the first, and commissioned it in August 1985. This combination of furnaces was used to demonstrate the two-stage process in continuous operation in mid-1987.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt; However, for most of the time the two furnaces were not able to operate simultaneously due to a constraint in the capacity of the baghouse used to filter the lead dust from the waste gas.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt;

A series of process improvements, particularly in the waste gas handling system, resulted in increasing the throughput of the plant from the initial design of 5 t/h to 10 t/h.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; The pilot plant had treated more than 125,000 t of lead concentrate by April 1989.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt;

The two furnaces were also used to develop a process to recover lead from the Mount Isa lead smelter’s drossing operations.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt;

==== The lead ISASMELT demonstration plant (1991–1995) ====
Based on the results of the pilot plant work, the MIM Holdings Board of Directors approved the construction of an A$65 million&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"&gt;R L Player, C R Fountain and J M I Tuppurainen, "Isasmelt developments," in: ''Mervyn Willis Symposium and Smelting &amp; Refining Course, 6–8 July 1992'' (The University of Melbourne: Melbourne, 1992), 20:1–20:13.&lt;/ref&gt; demonstration plant, capable of producing 60,000 t/y of lead bullion.&lt;ref name = "Matthew"/&gt; This plant operated from early 1991 until 1995.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"&gt;W J Errington, P Arthur, J Wang and Y Dong, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/XT_ISASMELT_Paper_ErringtonPbIsa.pdf "The Isa-YMG lead smelting process,"] in: ''Lead-Zinc ’05, Kyoto, Japan, 17–19 October 2005''. Accessed: 16 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially designed to treat 20 t/h of lead concentrate using lance air enriched to 27%. However, the oxygen originally designated for its use was diverted to the more profitable copper smelting operations, and the feed rate to the lead ISASMELT demonstration plant was severely restricted.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt; When there was sufficient oxygen available in 1993 to increase the enrichment level to 33–35%, treatment rates of up to 36 t/h of concentrate were achieved, with residual lead in the final reduction furnace slag being in the range of 2–5%.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt;

The two-stage approach to ISASMELT lead smelting was partly driven by the relatively low lead content of Mount Isa lead concentrates (typically in the range of 47–52% lead during the lead ISASMELT development period).&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R M S Watsford, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration by Mount Isa Mines Ltd, Mount Isa, Queensland," in: ''Mining and Metallurgical Practices in Australasia, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume'', Ed. J T Woodcock (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980) 208–213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P D Munro, "Lead-zinc-silver ore concentration practice at the lead-zinc concentrator of Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Melbourne, 1993), 498–503.&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to produce lead bullion in a single furnace with such low concentrate grades would result in excessive fuming of lead oxide with a huge amount of material that would have to be returned to the furnace to recover the lead&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt; and, consequently, a higher energy demand as that material had to be reheated to the furnace temperatures.

Concentrates with higher lead contents can be smelted directly into lead metal in a single furnace without excess fuming.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt; This was demonstrated on the large scale in 1994, when 4000 t of concentrate containing 67% lead were treated at rates up to 32 t/h with lance air enriched to 27%. During these trials, 50% of the lead in the concentrate was converted to lead bullion in the smelting furnace, while most of the rest ended up as lead oxide in the smelting furnace slag.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt;

Like the lead ISASMELT pilot plant, the lead ISASMELT demonstration plant suffered from constraints imposed by the waste gas handling system. In the case of the demonstration plant, the problem was caused by sticky fume that formed an insulating layer on the convection tube bundles of the waste heat boilers, significantly reducing the heat transfer rates and thus the ability of the boilers to reduce the waste gas temperature.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; As the plant used baghouses to filter lead fume from the waste gas, it was necessary to reduce the temperature of the gas below the point at which the bags would be damaged by high temperatures. The problem was solved by allowing cool air to mix with the hot waste gas to lower the temperature to a level at which the baghouse could operate.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; This reduced the ISASMELT plant’s capacity because it was again limited by the volume of gas that could be filtered by the baghouse.

The lead ISASMELT demonstration plant was mothballed in 1995 because there was insufficient concentrate to keep both it and the rest of the lead smelter operating.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; It was too small to treat all the Mount Isa lead concentrate by itself.

==== Commercial primary-lead ISASMELT plants (2005– ) ====
The first commercial primary-lead ISASMELT furnace was installed at the Yunnan Chihong Zinc and Germanium Company Limited (YCZG) greenfield zinc and lead smelting complex at Qujing in Yunnan Province in China.&lt;ref name = "YCZG"&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/CymgLeadSmelter.aspx YCZG Isasmelt plant.] Accessed 17 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; This furnace was part of a plant consisting of the ISASMELT furnace and a blast furnace specially designed to treat high-lead ISASMELT slag.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2005"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace was designed to produce both the slag and lead bullion, with about 40% of the lead in the concentrate being converted to lead bullion in the ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "YCZG"/&gt;

The ISASMELT–blast furnace combination was designed to treat 160,000 t/y of lead concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

The second commercial primary-lead ISASMELT furnace was commissioned at Kazzinc’s smelting complex at Ust-Kamenogorsk in Kazakhstan in 2012. It is designed to treat 300,000 t/y of lead concentrate, again using an ISASMELT–blast furnace combination.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

YCZG is constructing another lead ISASMELT at a new greenfield smelter in Huize in China, and this is due to be commissioned in 2013.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

==== Secondary-lead smelting (1982– ) ====
While the lead ISASMELT 5 t/h pilot plant was being designed in 1982–1983, MIM continued to use the 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig to develop other processes, including the dross treatment process previously mentioned, and the treatment of lead-acid battery paste for lead recycling.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1987"/&gt;

The MIM Holdings Board of Directors approved the construction of an ISASMELT plant at Britannia Refined Metals, the company’s lead refinery at Northfleet in the United Kingdom, for commercial recovery of lead from battery paste to supplement the existing plant, which used a short rotary furnace to produce 10,000 t/y of lead.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"&gt;W J Errington, P Hawkins and A Lim, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/ISASMELT%20%20FOR%20LEAD%20RECYCLING.pdf "ISASMELT for lead recycling,’] in: ''PbZn 2010'', Eds. A Siegmund, L Centomo, C Geenen, N Piret, G Richards and R Stephens (Wiley Publishing, 2010). Accessed: 17 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The new plant increased annual production to 30,000 t/y of recycled lead, and was commissioned in 1991.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace was used to produce low-antimony lead bullion from the battery paste and an antimony-rich slag that contained 55–65% lead oxide. While it was possible to recover the lead from the slag in the ISASMELT furnace by a reduction step, the total throughput of the plant was increased by treating the slag in the short rotary furnace when sufficient quantities of the slag had been generated.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; The plant was designed to treat 7.7 t/h of battery paste, but routinely treated 12 t/h.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; The plant was shut down in 2004 when Xstrata Zinc, which took over the MIM Holdings lead operations, decided to leave the lead recycling business.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt;

A second lead ISASMELT plant for recovering lead from recycled batteries was commissioned in 2000 in Malaysia at Metal Reclamation Industries’ Pulau Indah plant.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 2010"/&gt; This ISASMELT plant has a design capacity of 40,000 t/y of lead bullion.&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt;

=== Copper ISASMELT development ===

==== Small-scale test work (1979–1987) ====
Scientists at the CSIRO conducted small-scale test work on copper sulfide concentrate in 1979,&lt;ref name = "Floyd and Conochie"/&gt; using the CSIRO’s 50&amp;nbsp;kg Sirosmelt test rig.&lt;ref name = "Floyd, 1980"&gt;J M Floyd, N Grave and B W Lightfoot, "Small pilot plant trials of Sirosmelt copper smelting," In: ''Australia–Japan Extractive Metallurgy Symposium, Sydney, Australia, 1980'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 1980), 63–74.&lt;/ref&gt; These trials included producing copper matte containing 40–52% copper and, in some cases, converting the matte to produce blister copper.&lt;ref name = "Floyd, 1980"/&gt;

The results of this work were sufficiently encouraging that MIM in 1983&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"&gt;J Pritchard, R L Player and W J Errington, "Isasmelt technology for copper smelting," Technical Paper #A89-5 (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1989).&lt;/ref&gt; undertook its own copper smelting test work program using its 120&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig, which had by then been rerated to 250&amp;nbsp;kg/h.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; It was found that the process was easy to control and that copper loss to slag was low.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; It was also learned that the process could easily recover copper from copper converter slag concentrate, of which there was a large stockpile at Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt;

==== The copper ISASMELT demonstration plant (1987–1992) ====
Construction of a 15 t/h demonstration copper ISASMELT plant began in 1986. The design was based on MIM’s 250&amp;nbsp;kg/h test work and operating experience with the lead ISASMELT pilot plant.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; It cost A$11 million&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; and was commissioned in April 1987.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; The initial capital cost was recovered in the first 14 months of operation.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;

As with the lead ISASMELT pilot plant, the copper ISASMELT demonstration plant was integrated into copper smelter operations&lt;ref name = "Fewings"/&gt; and justified by the 20% (30,000 t/y) increase in copper production that it provided.&lt;ref name = "Coulter"/&gt; It quickly treated the entire backlog of converter slag concentrate, which could not be treated at high rates in the reverberatory furnaces without generating [[magnetite]] ("Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;") accretions that would necessitate shutting down the reverberatory furnaces for their removal.&lt;ref name = "Casley"&gt;G E Casley, J Middlin and D White, "Recent developments in reverberatory furnace and converter practice at the Mount Isa Mines copper smelter," in: ''Extractive Metallurgy of Copper, Volume 1,'' (The Metallurgical Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1976), 117–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

The demonstration copper ISASMELT plant was used to further develop the copper process. [[Refractory]] life was initially shorter than expected&lt;ref name = "Fountain"&gt;C R Fountain, J M I Tuppurainen and N R Whitworth, "Operation of the copper Isasmelt plants at Mount Isa Mines Limited, Mount Isa, Qld," in: ''Australasian Mining and Metallurgy, The Sir Maurice Mawby Memorial Volume, Second Edition'', Eds. J T Woodcock and J K Hamilton (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Melbourne, 1993), 695–700.&lt;/ref&gt; and considerable effort was devoted to understanding the reasons and attempting to extend the life of the refractories.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; At the end of the life of the demonstration plant, the longest refractory life achieved was 90 weeks.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt;

Lance life was also low initially.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; Inexperienced operators could destroy a lance in as little as 10 minutes.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; However, as a result of modifications to the lance design, the development of techniques to determine the position of the lance in the bath, and a rise in the operating experience, the typically lance life was extended to a week.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt;

The demonstration plant was commissioned with high-pressure (700 kPag) air injected down the lance.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; Later, after extensive testing of low-pressure lance designs and trials using oxygen enrichment of the lance air, a 70 t/d oxygen plant and a 5 Nm3/s blower with a discharge pressure of 146 kPag were purchased.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; The new lance design was capable of operating at pressures below 100 kPag.&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"/&gt; Using enrichment of the oxygen in the lance air to 35%, the demonstration plant throughput was lifted to 48 t/h of concentrate, and the gross energy used during smelting was reduced from 25.6 GJ/t of contained copper to 4.1 GJ/t.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt;

==== Commercial primary-copper ISASMELT plants (1990– ) ====
The successful operation and development of the demonstration copper ISASMELT, and the degree of interest shown in the new process by the global smelting community, gave MIM Holdings sufficient confidence to license the ISASMELT technology to external companies,&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"&gt;W J Errington, P S Arthur and C R Fountain, "Isasmelt – clean, efficient smelting," in: ''Proceedings of Global Conference on Environmental and Metallurgy [sic], GME ’99, 24–27 May 1999, Beijing, China'', Eds. D Qiu and Y Chu (International Academic Publishers: Beijing, 1999), 172–164.&lt;/ref&gt; so an agreement under which MIM could incorporate the Sirosmelt lance into ISASMELT technology was signed with the CSIRO in 1989.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;

===== AGIP Australia Pty Ltd =====
MIM signed the first ISASMELT licence agreement with Agip Australia Proprietary Limited ("Agip") in July 1990. Agip, a subsidiary of the Italian oil company [[Eni|ENI]], was developing the Radio Hill nickel-copper deposit near Karratha in Western Australia.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt; MIM and representatives of Agip conducted a series of trials in which 4 tonnes of Radio Hill concentrate was smelted in the 250&amp;nbsp;kg/h test rig at Mount Isa.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;

The Agip ISASMELT plant was designed to treat 7.5 t/h of the Radio Hill concentrate and produce 1.5 t/h of granulated matte with a combined nickel and copper content of 45% for sale.,&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; It was the same size as the copper ISASMELT demonstration plant (2.3 m internal diameter) and had a 5.5 Nm3/s blower to provide the lance air.&lt;ref name = "Bartsch"/&gt; Commissioning of the plant began in September 1991;&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; however, the Radio Hill mine and smelter complex were forced to close by low nickel prices after less than six months,&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; before commissioning was completed.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace achieved its design capacity within three months.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; Subsequent owners of the mine focussed on mining and mineral processing only, and the ISASMELT plant has been dismantled.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt;

===== Freeport-McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc. =====
In 1973, the [[Freeport-McMoRan]] Copper and Gold Inc. ("Freeport") smelter at [[Miami, Arizona]], installed a 51 MW electric furnace at its Miami smelter. The decision was based on a long-term electrical power contract with the [[Salt River Project]] that provided the company with a very low rate for electricity.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; This contract expired in 1990 and the resulting increase in electricity prices prompted the then owners of the smelter, [[Cyprus Mines Corporation#Later history|Cyprus Miami Mining Corporation]] ("Cyprus"), to seek alternative smelting technologies to provide lower operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt;

The technologies evaluated included the:
* Contop flame cyclone reactor
* [[Flash smelting|Inco flash furnace]]
* ISASMELT
* Mitsubishi furnace
* Noranda reactor
* [[Flash smelting|Outokumpu flash furnace]]
* Teniente furnace.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt;
The Contop, Inco, Mitsubishi and Outokumpu processes "were all eliminated primarily because of their high dust levels, high capital costs and poor adaptability to the existing facility". The Teniente converter was ruled out because it required the use of the electric furnace for partial smelting. The Noranda reactor was not selected "because of its high refractory wear and its poor adaptability to the existing plant due to the handling of the reactor slag".&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; ISASMELT was chosen as the preferred technology and a licence agreement was signed with MIM in October 1990. The major factor in the decision to select the ISASMELT technology was the ability to fit it into the existing plant and to maximise the use of existing equipment and infrastructure, while the major disadvantage was seen to be the risks associated with scaling up the technology from the Mount Isa demonstration plant.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt;

The Miami copper ISASMELT furnace was designed to treat 590,000 t/y (650,000 short tons per year) of copper concentrate, a treatment rate that was constrained by the capacity of the sulfuric acid plant used to capture the sulfur dioxide from the smelter’s waste gases.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; The existing electric furnace was converted from smelting duties to a slag cleaning furnace and providing matte surge capacity for the converters.&lt;ref name = "Bhappu"/&gt; The ISASMELT furnace was commissioned on 11 June 1992 and in 2002 treated over 700,000 t/y of concentrate.&lt;ref name = "Voltura"&gt;S A Voltura, "Continuous improvements at the Phelps Dodge Miami Mining smelter," ''Society of Mining Engineers Annual Meeting, 24–26 February 2004, Denver Colorado'', Preprint 04-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The modernisation of the Miami smelter cost an estimated US$95 million.&lt;ref name = "Player, 1992"/&gt;

In 1993, the Cyprus Minerals Company merged with AMAX to form the [[Cyprus Mines Corporation#Later history|Cyprus Amax Minerals company]], which was in turn taken over by the [[Phelps Dodge]] Corporation in late 1999. Phelps Dodge was acquired by Freeport in 2006.

The Miami smelter is one of only three remaining operating copper smelters in the United States, where there were 16 in 1979.&lt;ref name = "Johnson"&gt;R E Johnson, N J Themelis and G A Eltringham, "A survey of worldwide copper converter practices," in: ''Copper and Nickel Converters'', Ed. R E Johnson (The Metallurgical Society of the American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical and Petroleum Engineers: New York, 1979), 1–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Mount Isa Mines Limited =====
The third commercial copper ISASMELT plant was installed in MIM’s Mount Isa copper smelter at a cost of approximately A$100 million.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; It was designed to treat 104 t/h of copper concentrate, containing 180,000 t/y of copper, and it began operation in August 1992.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt;

A significant difference between the Mount Isa copper ISASMELT plant and all the others is that it uses an Ahlstrom Fluxflow&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; waste heat boiler&lt;ref name = "Peippo"&gt;R Peippo, H Holopainen and J Nokelainen, "Copper smelter waste heat boiler technology for the next millennium," in: ''Proceedings of Copper ’99-Cobre ’99 International Conference, Volume V—Smelting Operations and Advances'', Eds. D B George, W J Chen, P J Mackey and A J Weddick (The Minerals, Metals and Materials Society: Warrendale, Pennsylvania, 1999), 71–82.&lt;/ref&gt; to recover heat from the furnace waste gas. This boiler uses a recirculating fluid bed of particles to rapidly quench the gas as it leaves the furnace, and then uses the enhanced heat transfer properties of solid–solid contact to cool the particles as they are carried past boiler tubes that are suspended in a shaft above the bed.&lt;ref name = "Fountain"/&gt; The high heat transfer rate means that the Fluxflow&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; boiler is relatively compact compared with conventional waste heat boilers and the rapid cooling of the waste gas limits the formation of sulfur trioxide ("SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;"), which in the presence of water forms sulfuric acid that can cause corrosion of cool surfaces.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"&gt;W J Errington, J S Edwards and P Hawkins, "Isasmelt technology—current status and future development," ''The Journal of the South African Institute of Mining and Metallurgy'', July–August 1997, 161–168. http://www.saimm.co.za/Journal/v097n04p161.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mount Isa copper smelter 2002.jpg|thumbnail|Mount Isa copper smelter in 2002. The building beneath the left-hand crane is the ISASMELT plant.]]

In the early years of operation, the Fluxflow&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; boiler was the cause of significant down time, because the rate of wear of the boiler tubes was much higher than expected.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"/&gt; The problems were solved by understanding the gas flows within the boiler redesigning the boiler tubes to minimise the effects of erosion.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"/&gt;

The life of the refractory bricks in the ISASMELT furnace was initially shorter than expected and a water cooling system was briefly considered to extend them;&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1997"/&gt; however, this was not installed and operational improvements have resulted in a significant extension of the life of the lining without this capital and operating expense.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"&gt;C R Fountain, "Isasmelt and IsaMills—models of successful R&amp;D," in: ''Young Leaders’ Conference, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia, 19–21 March 2002'' (The Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy: Melbourne, 2002), 1–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998, the refractory lining lives have exceeded the two-year design life,&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; with lives of the 8th and 9th linings almost reaching three years.&lt;ref name = "Burford"&gt;B Burford, "The ISASMELT technology package: over 30 years of innovation," ''The AusIMM Bulletin'', February 2009, 26–30.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent lining lasted for 50 months, with the one before that lasting for 44 months.&lt;ref&gt;[https://industryadvocate.com.au/smelter-shutdown-record-in-sight/ "Smelter shutdown record in sight,"] ''Queensland Industry Advocate'', 26 May 2014. Viewed 3 April 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first years of operation at Mount Isa, the throughput of the ISASMELT furnace was constrained by problems with some of the ancillary equipment in the plant, including the boiler, slag granulation system and concentrate filters.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; The ultimate constraint was the decision during its construction to keep one of the two reverberatory furnaces on line to increase the copper smelter production to 265,000 t/y of anode copper. The smelter’s Peirce-Smith converters became a bottleneck and the feed rate of the ISASMELT furnace had to be restrained to allow sufficient matte to be drawn from the reverberatory furnace to prevent it freezing solid.&lt;ref name = "Bill, 2002"/&gt; The ISASMELT 12-month rolling average of the feed rate fell just short of 100 t/h for much of this period, not quite reaching the design annual average of 104 t/h.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; MIM decided to shut down the reverberatory furnace in 1997, and the ISASMELT plant 12-month rolling mean feed rate quickly exceeded the 104 t/h design when this constraint was lifted.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt;

The performance of the ISASMELT plant was sufficiently encouraging that MIM decided to expand the ISASMELT treatment rate to 166 t/h by adding a second oxygen plant to allow higher enrichment of the lance air.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; As a result, by late 2001 it had achieve a peak rate of 190 t/h of concentrate, and the smelter produced a peak annual total of 240,000 t of anode copper.&lt;ref name = "Fountain, 2002"/&gt; At that time, the Mount Isa copper smelter, together with its copper refinery in Townsville, was among the lowest cost copper smelters in the world.

Lance life is typically two weeks, with lance changes taking 30 to 40 minutes, and repairs usually being limited to replacement of the lance tips.&lt;ref name = "Gao"&gt;M Gao, P S Arthur and N Aslin, [http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Publications/Technical%20Papers/XT_ISASMELT_Paper_Hainan%20conference%20EN_2.pdf "Proven technologies from Xstrata and their applications for copper smelting and refining in China,"] paper presented at Hainan Conference, China.

===== Sterlite Industries (India) Limited =====
[[Sterlite Industries]] ("Sterlite"), now a subsidiary of [[Vedanta Resources]] plc ("Vedanta"), built a copper smelter in [[Thoothukudi|Tuticorin]] using an ISASMELT furnace and [[Converting (metallurgy)#Equipment|Peirce-Smith converters]]. The smelter was commissioned in 1996&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; and was designed to produce 60,000 t/y of copper (450,000 t/y of copper concentrate),&lt;ref name = "Burford"/&gt; but by increasing the oxygen content of the lance air and making modifications to other equipment, the ISASMELT furnace feed rate was increased to the point where the smelter was producing 180,000 t/y of copper.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt;

Sterlite commissioned a new ISASMELT furnace in May 2005&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"/&gt; that was designed to treat 1.3 million t/y of copper concentrate,&lt;ref name = "Burford"/&gt; and the smelter’s production capacity was expanded to 300,000 t/y of copper.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2005"/&gt; The new plant reached its design capacity, measured over a three-month period, six months after it started treating its first feed.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"/&gt; Vedanta’s website states that the new ISASMELT furnace was successfully ramped up "in a record period of 45 days".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sterlite-industries.com/about_us/Our_History.aspx Sterlite Industries - Our history].

===== Yunnan Copper Corporation Limited =====
In the 1990s, the Chinese government decided to increase the efficiency of the Chinese economy and reduce the environmental effects of heavy industry by modernising plants.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; As a response, the Yunnan Copper Corporation Limited ("YCC") upgraded its existing plant, which was based on a sinter plant and an electric furnace, with a copper ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; As with the Miami smelter, the electric furnace was converted from smelting duty to separation of matte and slag and providing matte surge capacity for the converters, and again, the small footprint of the ISASMELT furnace was very important in retrofitting it to the existing smelter.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt;

The YCC ISASMELT plant had a design capacity of 600,000 dry t/y of copper concentrate and started smelting concentrate on 15 May 2002.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; YCC placed a lot of emphasis on training its operators, sending people to Mount Isa for training over a seven-month period during 2001 ahead of the ISASMELT commissioning.&lt;ref name = "Li, 2003"/&gt; The total cost of the smelter modernisation program, including the ISASMELT furnace, was 640 million yuan (approximately US$80 million) and the smelter’s concentrate treatment rate increased from 470,000 t/y to 800,000 t/y as a result.&lt;ref name = "Shi"&gt;Y F Shi, "Yunnan Copper’s Isasmelt – successful smelter modernization in China," in: ''Sohn International Symposium on Advanced Processing of Metals and Materials, Volume 8 – International Symposium on Sulfide Smelting 2006'', Eds.

The transfer of operating knowledge from MIM to YCC was sufficient for the first ISASMELT furnace refractory lining to last for two years, a marked improvement on the life of the initial lining of other plants.&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt;

YCC described the modernisation project as "a great success, achieving all that was expected."&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt; Energy consumption per tonne of blister copper produced decreased by 34% as a result of installing the ISASMELT furnace, and YCC estimated that during the first 38 months of operation, it saved approximately US$31.4 million through reduced energy costs alone,&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt; giving the modernisation a very short payback by industry standards.

In 2004, YCC’s management was presented with awards for Innovation in Project Management and the National Medal for High Quality Projects by the Chinese government to mark the success of the smelter modernisation project.&lt;ref name = "Shi"/&gt;

===== Mopani Copper Mines plc =====
[[Mopani Copper Mine]]s ("Mopani") was part of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Limited until it was privatised in 2000. It owns the Mufulira smelter, which operated with an electric furnace with a nominal capacity of 420,000 t/y of copper concentrate (180,000 t/y of new copper).&lt;ref name = "Ross"&gt;J Ross and D de Vries, [http://www.isasmelt.com/downloads/XTpaper_Mopani_MSUPyromet05.pdf "Mufulira smelter upgrade project – "Industry’ smelting on the Zambian Copperbelt."] Accessed 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Mopani decided to install a copper ISASMELT plant that could treat 850,000 t/y of copper concentrate, including a purpose-designed electric matte settling furnace to separate the ISASMELT matte and slag and also return slag from the smelter’s Peirce-Smith converters.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;

Before committing to the ISASMELT technology, Mopani considered the following process options:
* an electric furnace
* a flash furnace, including one operating direct-to-blister
* the Mitsubishi smelting process
* the Teniente converter
* the Noranda reactor
* an Ausmelt furnace
* an ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;
Mopani considered electric furnaces unproven at the proposed concentrate feed rates, and the low sulfur dioxide concentration in the waste gas would make its capture very expensive.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt; Flash furnaces and the Mitsubishi process were excluded because:
* they were considered too technically complex for the Zambian environment
* they were not well suited for retrofitting to the Mufulira smelter
* they had a high capital cost associated with them.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;
Mopani excluded the Teniente converter and Noranda reactor because of the poor performance of the Teniente converter at the other Zambian smelter operating at the time and because of "the relatively inexperienced technical resources available at the time".&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt;

Mopani selected ISASMELT technology over Ausmelt technology after visits to operating plants in Australia, the United States of America, and China.&lt;ref name = "Ross"/&gt; The total cost of the project was US$213 million.

The [[Southern Peru Copper Corporation]] ("SPCC") is a subsidiary of the [[Southern Copper Corporation]] ("SCC"), one of the world’s largest copper companies&lt;ref name = "Walqui"&gt;H Walqui and C Noriega, "Design, construction and start-up of the Ilo smelter modernization project," presented at the ''Society of Mining Engineers Annual Meeting, 25–28 February 2007, Denver, Colorado''. Preprint 07–081.&lt;/ref&gt; and currently 75.1% owned by Grupo México. Grupo México acquired the shares in SPCC when it bought ASARCO in November 1999&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt;

In the 1990s, SPCC was seeking to modernise its smelter at Ilo in southern Peru as part of 1997 commitment to the Peruvian government to capture at least 91.7% of the sulfur dioxide generated in its smelting operations by January 2007.&lt;ref name = "Walqui"/&gt; It initially selected flash smelting technology to replace its reverberatory furnaces, at a cost of almost US$1 billion;&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt; however, one of the first actions following Grupo México’s acquisition of ASARCO was to review the proposed Ilo smelter modernisation plans.&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt;

Six different technologies were evaluated during the review. These were:
* Outokumpu flash smelting
* the Mitsubishi process
* the Noranda reactor
* ISASMELT
* Ausmelt
* the Teniente converter.&lt;ref name = "Walqui"/&gt;
The ISASMELT technology was selected as a result of the review, resulting in a reduction in the capital cost of almost 50% and was also the alternative with the lowest operating costs.&lt;ref name = "Samaniego"/&gt;

The plant was commissioned in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isasmelt.com/EN/Installations/Pages/SouthernPeruCopperCorporationCopperSmelter.aspx SPCC Isasmelt plant.] Accessed 21 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the plant had an average feed rate of 165.2 t/h of concentrate and 6.3 t/h of reverts (cold copper-bearing materials that arise from spillage and accretions in the pots used to transport matte or other molten materials).&lt;ref name = "Alvear, 2010"/&gt;

SPCC has reported a cost of approximately $600 million for the smelter modernization.&lt;ref&gt;Southern Copper Corporation, "Southern Copper Corporation completed the modernization of its Ilo smelter," Press Release, 1 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Kazzinc =====
[[Kazzinc]] selected the copper ISASMELT process for its [[Ust-Kamenogorsk]] metallurgical complex. It is designed to treat 290,000 t/y of copper concentrate&lt;ref name = "Installations list"/&gt; and was commissioned in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kazzinc.com/#en/Operations/Organization of operations/Ust-Kamenogorsk/. Organisation of operations at Ust-Kamenogorsk.] Accessed 21 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A projected capital cost for the smelter and refinery in 2006 was US$178 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://metalresourcesdirectory.com/articles/kazakh-kazzinc-to-build-copper-smelter-in-ust-kamenogorsk.html "Kazakh Kazzinc to build copper smelter at Ust-Kamenogorsk], 23 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== First Quantum Minerals =====
In the fourth quarter of 2011, the [[First Quantum Minerals]] board approved the construction of an ISASMELT-based smelter at Kansanshi in Zambia.&lt;ref name = "FQM 4Q"&gt;First Quantum Minerals Ltd, [http://www.first-quantum.com/files/doc_financials/2011%20FQM%20Financial%20Statements%20and%20Q4%20MDA.pdf "Consolidated Financial Statements, December 31, 2011, December 31 2010 and January 1, 2010".] Accessed 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The smelter is to process 1.2 million t/y of copper concentrate to produce over 300,000 t/y of copper and 1.1 million t/y of sulfuric acid as a by-product.&lt;ref name = "FQM 4Q"/&gt; Construction is expected to be completed by mid-2014,&lt;ref name = "FQM PR"&gt;[http://www.first-quantum.com/default.aspx?SectionId=5cc5ecae-6c48-4521-a1ad-480e593e4835&amp;LanguageId=1&amp;PressReleaseId=cc391e4d-0c43-4ff9-b97e-42e68679c184 First Quantum press release.] Accessed 22 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and the capital cost is estimated at US$650 million.&lt;ref name = "FQM IP"&gt;[http://www.first-quantum.com/files/doc_presentations/Presentation%20-%20December%20-%20FINAL.pdf First Quantum investor presentation, December 2012.] Accessed 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated operating cost was given as US$69 per tonne of concentrate.&lt;ref name = "FQM IP"/&gt;

The Kansanshi copper smelter project is estimated to be worth US$340–500 million per year in reduced concentrate freight costs, export duties and sulfuric acid costs.&lt;ref name = "FQM 4Q"/&gt;

==== Commercial secondary-copper ISASMELT plants ====
In addition to treating copper concentrates, ISASMELT furnaces have also been built to treat secondary (scrap) copper materials.

===== Umicore N.V. =====
In the early 1990s, technical personnel from the then [[Umicore|Union Miniére]] worked with MIM Holdings personnel to develop an ISASMELT-based process to treat scrap materials and residues containing copper and lead.&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"/&gt; Union Miniére operated a smelter at [[Hoboken, Antwerp|Hoboken]], near [[Antwerp]]en in [[Belgium]], that specialised in recycling scrap non-ferrous materials. The test work program was undertaken using an ISASMELT test rig at MIM Holdings’ lead refinery, Britannia Refined Metals, at [[Northfleet]] in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"/&gt;

A demonstration plant was designed by MIM Holdings personnel and operated for several months at the Hoboken smelter site.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"&gt;J S Edwards and G R F Alvear, "Converting using ISASMELT technology," in: ''Cu2007 – Volume III (Book 2): The Carlos Díaz Symposium on Pyrometallurgy'', Eds. A R M Warner, C J Newman, A Vahed, D B George, P J Mackey and A Warczok (Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum: Westmount, Quebec, 2007), 17–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The new smelter was commissioned in the final quarter of 1997&lt;ref name = "Errington, 1999"/&gt; and in 2007 was treating up to 300,000 t/y of secondary materials.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; The installation of the ISASMELT furnace replaced "a large number of unit processes" and substantially reduced operating costs at the Hoboken smelter.&lt;ref name = "Arthur, 2006"/&gt;

Umicore’s Hoboken plant uses a two-step process in a single furnace. The first step involves the oxidation of the feed to form a copper matte and a lead-rich slag. The slag is then tapped and the remaining copper matte is then converted to blister copper.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; The lead-rich slag is subsequently reduced in a blast furnace to produce lead metal, while the copper is refined and the contained precious metals recovered.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt;

===== Aurubis AG =====
The then Hüttenwerke Kayser smelter at [[Lünen]] in Germany installed an ISASMELT plant in 2002 to replace three blast furnaces and one Peirce-Smith converter used for smelting scrap copper.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; The company was subsequently bought by [[Aurubis#History|Norddeutsche Affinerie AG]], which in turn became [[Aurubis]] AG.

The process used at the Lünen smelter involves charging the furnace with copper residues and scrap containing between 1 and 80% copper and then melting it in a reducing environment. This produces a "black copper phase" and a low-copper silica slag. Initially the black copper was converted to blister copper in the ISASMELT furnace.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt; However, in 2011 the smelter was expanded as part of the "KRS Plus" project. A top-blown rotary converter is now used to convert the black copper and the ISASMELT furnace runs continuously in smelting mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aurubis.com/en/responsibility/environment/production-sites/luenen "Arubis' achievements at the Lünen production site."] Accessed 26 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G R F Alvear, A S Burrows and S Nikolic, [http://www.expomin.cl/marketing/pdf/2012/presentacion_gerardo_alvear.pdf "Modern, flexible and clean technologies for recovery and recycling of valuable materials,"] ''2nd International Workshop on Recovery of Metals from Mining Waste, M2R2, Santiago, Chile, 12–13 April 2012''. Accessed 26 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation of the ISASMELT furnace increased the overall copper recovery in the plant by reducing losses to slag, reduced the number of furnaces in operation, decreased the waste gas volume, and decreased energy consumption by more than 50%. The production capacity exceeds the original design by 40%.&lt;ref name = "Edwards, 2007"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4743">The '''Institute of Tropical Forest Conservation''' (ITFC) is a post-graduate research institute based in the [[Bwindi Impenetrable Forest]],{{fact|date=June 2017}} in south-western [[Uganda]]. The institute is a semi-autonomous part of [[Mbarara University of Science and Technology]] and is focused on research, training, and monitoring for conservation management in the Albertine Rift ecoregion.{{fact|date=June 2017}}

ITFC is located on the Eastern border of Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Ruhija village, Rubanda district of South Western Uganda. The long history of ITFC's work in ecological and sociological research has established it as a leading post graduate research institution and field station. With over 200 publications about conservation in the region and a wealth of national, regional and international partners and donors - ITFC's work in conservation has influenced the direction of conservation the world over, and more specifially in the Albertine Rift ecoregion.

The Bwindi Impenetrable Forest is a [[tropical moist broadleaf forest]] in the [[Afromontane]] [[Albertine Rift montane forests]] ecoregion.{{fact|date=June 2017}} It is primarily protected within the [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] (BINP).{{fact|date=June 2017}}

==History==
{{citation needed span|ITFC dates back to 1983 with an ecological survey of the Bwindi forest by Thomas M. Butynski, funded by the [[New York Zoological Society]] which is now Wildlife Conservation society.  The forest is part of the only homeland of endangered [[mountain gorilla]]s, which are now [[endemic]] to the [[Virunga Mountains]].

In 1986, the Impenetrable Forest Conservation Project (IFCP) began with support from the [[World Wildlife Fund]].  The project's mission was to protect the last remaining Afromontane forests of south-west Uganda: Bwindi, [[Mgahinga Gorilla National Park|Mgahinga]], and [[Echuya Batwa|Echuya]].

In 1991, the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest Reserve became the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and the Mgahinga Forest Reserve became [[Mgahinga Gorilla National Park]], a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].|date=June 2017}}

The IFPC became the ITFC - a semi autonomous academic unit of Mbarara University of Science and Technology in 1991, the same year in which Bwindi Impenetrable National Park was established. The Establishment of Bwindi Impenetrable and Mgahinga National Parks was after a successiful recommendation by ITFC (then IFCP), Mbarara University of Science and Technology and other conservation partners after they expressed the danger that Bwindi and Mgahinga Forests faced if not quickly gazetted as National parks.

== Work ==
As part of their work, ITFC carries out ecological research and monitoring on the state on both plants and animals all around the Albertine Rift ecoregion. This puts makes places such as Mount Rwenzori National Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, Semuliki National Park, Mount Elgon National Park, Mgahinga National National Park, Bwindi Impenetrable National Park and the Greater Virunga Landscape. Activities such as vegetation monitoring, animal monitoring, Gorilla population census, community involvement in conservation, promotion of sustainable tourism practice among so many others are the regular activities at ITFC.

== Cellular Defenses ==
In a healthy individual, immune cells patrol blood vessels to detect and respond to danger through molecules frequently found on pathogens called [[Pathogen-associated molecular pattern|PAMPs]], and molecules that are released by damaged cells, [[Damage-associated molecular pattern|DAMPs]].&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Immune cells involved in intravascular surveillance are [[neutrophil]]s, [[monocytes]], [[Natural killer T cell|invariant natural killer T cells]], [[kupffer cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[mast cell]]s.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; These cells express particular receptors such as [[toll-like receptor]]s and proteins like [[CD36]] that allow them to recognize and respond to danger signals.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; [[Endothelium|Endothelial cells]] lining the vasculature are also a part of the intravasculature's cellular defense system. They express molecules such as, [[CD14]], [[TLR2]], [[TLR4]], [[TLR9]], MD2, and [[MYD88|MyD88]], to detect bacteria in the blood.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Leukocytes move through blood vessels using protein-protein interactions between cells and are also assisted by [[Hemodynamics|blood flow]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Circulating immune cells behave differently in the presence and absence of an infection. For example, in the absence of an invader, monocytes migrate randomly throughout the microvasculature, cerebral vessels, and mesentery vessels. However, in the presence of an invader, monocytes emigrate to the infected area.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Similarly, neutrophils use a [[Leukocyte extravasation|rolling mechanism]] to counteract the blood flow and localize to the infected area.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; In a healthy state, neutrophils have been observed to exhibit a similar but brief crawling mechanism. The function and precise mechanism is not yet known.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Immune Responses ==

=== Inflammation ===
For more details on this topic, see [[Inflammation]].

Inflammation is an immune response in the body tissue due to stimulation of immune cells by pathogens, DAMPs, or stress.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The vasculature provides a means of transportation for alerting and recruiting immune cells.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Immunothrombosis ===
Thrombosis is the formation of blood coagulation and platelet aggregation and may result in lack of blood flow through the circulatory system. The depletion of oxygen may cause irreversible damage to organs. However, in other circumstances, the physiological process can be beneficial for the body. This process is known as immunothrombosis.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The process isolates infections using blood clots formed by activated [[platelet]]s, [[White blood cell|leukocytes]], and [[Coagulation|coagulation factors]] assist leukocytes in adhering and migrating to infected areas. Activated platelets produce [[fibrin]] in the blood vessel which seal leaky vessels and are important in blood coagulation. Fibrin provides a matrix to trap pathogens and recruit immune cells. Characteristics such as elongation and thickness of fibrin and protofibril, the precursor of fibrin, are determined by many factors including environmental conditions, physiological conditions, and branching of the fibrin fibers.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; This in turn influences the clot structure such as permeability, stiffness, and how easily the clot can be retracted. The shift from immunothrombosis to a more pathogenic thrombosis is due to dysregulated immunothrombosis.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

The '''list of uninhabited regions''' includes a number of places around the globe. The list changes year over year as human beings migrate into formerly uninhabited regions, or migrate out of formerly inhabited regions.

==List==
As a group, the list of uninhabited places are called the "nonecumene".  This is a special geography term which means the uninhabited area of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Gosh, Ajay Kumar. (2005).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6249">[[File:Ma’oz Hayyim.JPG|250px|thumbnail|Ma’oz Hayyim Synagogue]]
The '''Maoz Haim Synagogue''' was originally constructed in the 3rd century as a simple [[Byzantine]]-era type [[basilica]] building, later apsidical, in the [[Beit She'an]] region in northern [[Israel]]. Discovered in February 1974 by Mr. A. Ya’aqobi during some unrelated digging near [[Maoz Haim]], it stands out as an unusual archeological find that contains a record of synagogue development from a time of otherwise sparse historiography. It was even developing right through times of anti-Judaic legislation and sermonizing.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 211&lt;/ref&gt; The [[synagogue]] was located amongst a large settlement in which it served as a center of worship for [[Jews]] there from its beginning up through its final destruction by fire sometime in the early 7th century.&lt;ref name=Levine89&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
The initial layout began as a fourteen by twelve and a half meter square room with two rows of five columns with benches lining the walls, although none remained standing.&lt;ref&gt;אפרים שטרן. אנציקלופדיה החדשה לחפירות ארכיאולוגית בארץ ישראל&lt;/ref&gt; There was a single entrance eastward which is considered to be unusual. Most synagogues, aside from others which were located in the same northern Galil region, did not share this feature. However, it is mentioned in rabbinic sources as part of the synagogue layout in order to emulate the eastward entrance utilized by the [[Tabernacle]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The focal point of the synagogue was located southward, towards [[Jerusalem]]. Such an orientation had not previously been a feature of synagogues of the era, but was a new custom which was just beginning to take hold.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 195&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially noticeable with remodeling which was done in the 4th century, altering the synagogue to feature an apse in the southern wall. While the synagogue did not originally have a narthex, one was added during the later phases of building to the north, although it was totally destroyed. The later phases also added an additional entrance to the north, presumably to allow for easier access to the sanctuary.

==Apse==
The apse, where the Torah Shrine had previously stood in the first phase of the synagogue, was further modified in the 6th century to include a raised platform enclosed by a [[chancel screen]] which may have been used to emphasize the sanctity of the Torah shrine area as compared to the rest of the synagogue or the congregation.&lt;ref&gt;Fine, Steven. This Holy Place: On the Sanctity of the Synagogue During the Greco-Roman Period, 222&lt;/ref&gt; Such separations were very common in ancient synagogues and the raised [[bima]] area is what shows that this was no exception.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 87&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the screen depicted a menorah as well as [[Hebrew]] letters. The only Hebrew word in the entire building was [[Shalom]]; the remainder of the inscriptions were in [[Greek language|Greek]].

Behind the bima there was an area, possibly a geniza, in which several coins, pottery, and glass were found, which were amongst the few artifacts that were found at all at the site. The coins themselves were from the Byzantine era and helped identify the stages of building and development. More coins, fifty in all, were found outside the southern wall which were most likely hidden there amongst broken roof tiles in order to serve as a possible emergency funds, although the original owner never had the chance to claim them.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee, ed. Ancient Synagogues Revealed, 88&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many interesting [[mosaic]]s which were found at the dig site. The only figures found were birds, but there were also many Jewish symbols portrayed in mosaic form, including a [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]], an [[etrog]], a [[shofar]] and grapes. However, the symbols and birds were covered up in the 7th century, transforming the synagogue into one which was aniconic, likely as an act of piety.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Lee. The Ancient Synagogue: The First Thousand Years, 367&lt;/ref&gt;

In relation to this, the majority of the remaining floor was primarily composed of [[geometric patterns]]. Geometric patterns were popular before as in the earliest layer to an extent, but likely were especially valued in an aniconic society. However, it was not well preserved in the upper layers due to the aforementioned destruction of uncertain cause and additional construction that occurred by the local populace afterwards.&lt;ref name=Levine89/&gt; Despite this, the mosaic floor from the initial stage of construction was better preserved as it had been filled in with approximately 30 centimeters of dirt to lay the new aniconic floor, although not many artifacts were found within it.

A '''mural crown''' ({{lang-la|corona muralis}}) is a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] or headpiece representing [[city wall]]s or [[fortified tower|tower]]s. In [[classical antiquity]], it was an emblem of [[tutelary deities]] who watched over a city, and among the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] a [[military decoration]]. Later the mural crown developed into a symbol of European [[heraldry]], mostly for cities and towns, and in the 19th and 20th centuries was used in some [[republic|republican]] heraldry. 

==Usage in ancient times==
In [[Hellenistic]] culture, a mural crown identified [[Tutelary deity|tutelary deities]] such as the goddess [[Tyche]] (the embodiment of the fortune of a city, familiar to Romans as [[Fortuna]]), and [[Hestia]] (the embodiment of the protection of a city, familiar to Romans as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]]). The high cylindrical ''[[polos]]'' of [[Cybele]] too could be rendered as a mural crown in Hellenistic times, specifically designating the [[mother goddess]] as patron of a city.&lt;ref&gt;The mural crown as an indicator of the personification of a city was thoroughly explored by: {{cite book| last = Allègre| first = Fernand| authorlink = Fernand Allègre| title = Étude sur la déesse grecque Tyché| place = Paris| year = 1889| pages = 187–92| language = French| url=https://archive.org/details/tudesurlades00alluoft}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tyche Antioch Vatican Inv2672.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The [[Tyche]] of [[Antioch]], Roman version of a 3rd-century BC bronze by [[Eutychides]]]]
The mural crown became an [[Roman military decorations and punishments|ancient Roman military decoration]]. The  ''corona muralis'' (Latin for "walled crown") was a [[gold]]en crown, or a circle of gold intended to resemble a [[battlement]], bestowed upon the [[soldier]] who first climbed the wall of a besieged [[city]] or [[fortress]] to successfully place the [[flag|standard]] of the attacking [[army]] upon it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aulus Gellius]], ''Noctes Attici'', V.6.4; [[Livy]], ''Ab Urbe Condita'', XXVI.48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxfield1981"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valerie A. Maxfield|title=The Military Decorations of the Roman Army|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nuex2PW7QR0C&amp;pg=PA77|date=1 January 1981|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-04499-9|pages=77–}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Roman mural crown was made of gold, and decorated with turrets,&lt;ref&gt;''muri pinnis'' according to Aulus Gellius&lt;/ref&gt; as is the heraldic version.  As it was among the highest order of military decorations, it was not awarded to a claimant until after a strict investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Livy. l.c.; cf. [[Suetonius]], ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'', [[Augustus]] 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[rostrata]]'' mural crown, composed of the ''[[rostra]]'' indicative of captured ships, was assigned as naval prize to the first in a boarding party, similar to the [[naval crown]].

The Graeco-Roman goddess [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]]'s attributes on [[Greek coinage]] usually include her mural crown, signifying Rome's status as a loyal protector of [[Hellenic city-state]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mellor, R., "The Goddess Roma" in Haase, W., Temporini, H., (eds), ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt'', de Gruyter, 1991, pp 60-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heraldic use ==
[[File:Corona muralis.svg|thumb|A heraldic mural crown]]
The Roman military decoration was subsequently employed in European [[heraldry]], where the term denoted a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]] modeled after the walls of a [[castle]], which may be tinctured ''[[or (heraldry)|or]]'' (gold), ''[[argent]]'' (silver), ''[[gules]]'' (red), or ''proper'' (i.e. stone-coloured). In 19th-century Germany, mural crowns (''{{lang|de|Mauerkronen}}'') came to be adopted for the arms of cities, with increasingly specific details: "Residential (i.e. having a [[Residenz|''royal'' residence]]) cities and capital towns usually bear a ''{{lang|de|Mauerkrone}}'' with five towers, large towns one with four towers, smaller towns one with three", observed [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]], in ''A Complete Guide to Heraldry'', adding "Strict regulations in the matter do not yet exist" and warning that the usage was not British.&lt;ref&gt;William Newton, ''Display of Heraldry'' (1846, p. 307) however, instances the crest of [[Viscount Beresford]], and notes examples supporting the crest "to be seen over the arms of many of the British officers who distinguished themselves in the [[Napoleonic Wars|late war]]".&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times,{{when|date=April 2012}} mural crowns were used, rather than royal crowns, for [[Medieval commune|medieval]] and modern [[Italy|Italian]] {{lang|it|[[comune|comuni]]}}. A mural-crowned lady, [[Italia Turrita]], personifies Italy. In Italy, {{lang|it|comuni}} and some provinces and military corps have mural crowns on their coats of arms: gold with five towers for cities, and silver with nine-towered for others. The coat of arms of the [[Second Spanish Republic]] had a mural crown.

In the early 20th century [[Portugal]] established strict rules for its municipal heraldry, in which each coat of arms contains a mural crown, with three silver towers signifying a village or an urban parish, four silver towers representing a town, five silver towers standing for a city and five gold towers for a capital city. The Portuguese rules are also applied to most municipal coats of arms of [[Brazil]] and some other members of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]].

[[Romania]]n municipal coats of arms contain a mural crown, with one or three towers for villages and communes, five and seven towers for towns and municipalities.

The eagle on the [[coat of arms of Austria]] wears a mural crown to signify its status as a republic. This is in contrast to the royal crowns that adorned the [[double-headed eagle]] (and the imperial crown positioned above it) in the [[coat of arms of Austria-Hungary]] until their defeat in [[World War I]]. The mural-crowned eagle was abandoned under the [[Clerical fascism|clerico-fascist]] [[Federal State of Austria]] from 1934, but was reinstated in [[Allied-occupied Austria]] following [[World War II]] and remains in place to this day.

'''New Formalism''' is an [[architectural style]] that emerged in the United States during the mid 1950s and flowered in the 1960s. Buildings designed in that style exhibited many Classical elements including "strict symmetrical elevations"&lt;ref&gt;Wiffen, Marcus, American Architecture Since 1780: A Guide to the Styles, The M.I.T. Press, Cambridge Massachusetts, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; building proportion and scale, Classical columns, highly stylized [[entablature]]s and colonnades.  The style was used primarily for high-profile cultural, institutional and civic buildings. They were "typically constructed using rich materials such as marble, granite or man-made composites and also incorporated certain qualities of concrete that allowed for the creation of distinctive forms such as umbrella shells, waffle slabs and folded plates".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccenter.org/about/About-The-Music-Center/Trivia/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011114909/http://www.musiccenter.org/about/About-The-Music-Center/Trivia/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-10-11|title=Music Center - Architecture and Design of The Music Center|work=musiccenter.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Edward Durrell Stone]]'s New Delhi American Embassy (1954), which blended the architecture of the east with modern western concepts, is considered to be the symbolic start of New Formalism architecture.&lt;ref name="fullertonheritage.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fullertonheritage.org/Resources/archstyles/formalism.htm|title=Architectural Styles in Fullerton: New Formalism|work=fullertonheritage.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Common features of the New Formalism style, include:
* Use of traditionally rich materials, such as [[travertine]], marble, and granite or man-made materials that mimic their luxurious qualities
* Buildings usually set on a podium
* Designed to achieve modern monumentality
* Embraces classical precedents, such as arches, colonnades, classical columns and entablatures
* Smooth wall surfaces
* Delicacy of details
* Formal landscape; use of pools, fountains, sculpture within a central plaza"&lt;ref name="fullertonheritage.org"/&gt;

The '''pelvic thrust''' is the thrusting motion of the [[pelvis|pelvic]] region, which is used for a variety of activities, such as dance or [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].

==Sexual activity and innuendo==
The pelvic thrust is used during [[sexual intercourse]] by many species of [[mammal]]s,&lt;ref name="Estes1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. D.

In 2007, German scientists noted that female monkeys could increase the vigor and amount of pelvic thrusts made by the male by [[Female copulatory vocalizations|shouting during intercourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Study Reveals Why Monkeys Shout During Sex|url=http://www.livescience.com/7455-study-reveals-monkeys-shout-sex.html|website=livescience.com|publisher=Charles Q.

== Dance ==
[[File:Elvis Presley Jailhouse Rock2.jpg|thumb|Elvis Presley performing [[Jailhouse Rock (song)|Jailhouse Rock]]]]
One of the first to perform this move on stage was [[Elvis Presley]], which was quite controversial due to its obvious sexual connotations.  Due to this controversy, he was sometimes shown (as seen on his third appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'') from the waist up on TV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elvisinfonet.com/spotlight_edsullivan.html |title=Welcome to EIN |publisher=Elvisinfonet.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the pelvic thrust also became one of the signature moves of [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.businessinsider.in/HappyBirthdayMJ-Top-5-iconic-steps-Michael-Jackson-flooredus-with/articleshow/48743020.cms|title=#HappyBirthdayMJ – Top 5 iconic steps Michael Jackson floored us with|work=[[Business Insider]]| accessdate =3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twerking]] is also used as a dance move. The sideways pelvic thrust is a famous female dance move in Indian [[Bollywood]] films. Called Thumka, it appears in the lyrics of various songs.

== Infants ==
Pelvic thrusting is observed in infant monkeys, apes, and humans. These observations led ethologist John Bowlby (1969) to suggest that [[child sexuality|infantile sexual behavior]] may be the rule in mammals, not the exception. Thrusting has been observed in humans at eight to 10 months of age and may be an expression of affection. Typically, the infant clings to the parent, then nuzzles, thrusts, and rotates the pelvis for several seconds.&lt;ref&gt;Rathus, Spencer: ''Human sexuality in a world of diversity''  (2007) p. 314&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1728">The permanent adjustments of [[theodolite]]s are made to establish fixed relationship between the instrument's fundamental lines. The fundamental lines or axis of a [[theodolite|transit theodolite]] include the following:-
* [[Vertical axis]]
* Axis of plate levels
* Axis of [[telescope]]
* Line of collimation
* [[Horizontal axis]]
* Axis of altitude bubble and the vernier should read zero.
These adjustments once made last for a long time. These are important for accuracy of observations taken from the instrument. The permanent adjustments in case of transit theodolite are:-
* '''Horizontal axis adjustment'''.
The horizontal axis must be [[perpendicular]] to the vertical axis.
* '''Vertical circle index adjustment'''.
The vertical circle must read [[zero]] when the line of [[collimation]] is horizontal.
* '''Adjustment of altitude level'''.
The axis of altitude level must be [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the line of collimation.
* '''Collimation adjustment'''.
The line of collimation or line of sight should coincide with axis of the telescope.&lt;ref&gt;Surveying by Dr. B.C Punmia and Dr  Ashok Kumar Jain&lt;/ref&gt; The line of sight should also be perpendicular to the horizontal axis at its intersection with the vertical axis . Also, the [[optical axis]] , the axis of the objective slide, and the [[Sightline|line of sight]] should coincide.
* '''Adjustment of horizontal plate levels'''.
The axis of plate levels must be perpendicular to the vertical axis.&lt;ref&gt;surveying volume 1 by Prof. C.L Kochher, page no. 340 and 341.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''A. Peter McGraw''' (born 1970) is an associate professor of Marketing and Psychology at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]].&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt; His research spans the fields of [[judgment]] and [[decision making]], [[emotion]], [[Affect (psychology)|affect]], and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]].&lt;ref name="ref2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref7" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref10" /&gt;

McGraw is known for his early research on expectations and emotions. In studying the emotional reactions of Olympic athletes, he finds that bronze medalists often appear happier with their accomplishment than silver medalists because silver medalists are more likely to have higher (gold medal) aspirations, whereas bronze medalists are more likely to be the dark horse and exceed their expectations.&lt;ref name="ref11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref12" /&gt;

McGraw and Jonathan Levav have published work based on their theory of Emotional Accounting, which is a complement to prior research on [[Mental accounting|Mental Accounting]]. Emotional accounting posits that people use their feelings about money to guide how they spend it. For example, if people have negative feelings about a windfall of money, they tend to make utilitarian or virtuous expenditures in lieu of hedonic expenditures.&lt;ref name="ref5" /&gt;

McGraw also investigates what makes things funny. His [[humor]] research was inspired in part by his research on moral violations with [[Philip Tetlock]] and mixed emotions with Jeff Larsen. McGraw, along with Caleb Warren, developed the Benign Violation Theory (BVT), a general theory of humor based on evolutionary accounts of laughter and amusement. The BVT predicts that humor occurs when a person simultaneously appraises a situation as wrong or unsettling some way (i.e., a violation) and yet appraises the situation to be okay or acceptable in some way (i.e., benign).&lt;ref name="ref4" /&gt; His research is quickly moving the study of humor from the niche to mainstream psychology.

In 2014, McGraw co-authored ''The Humor Code'', a book about the science of humor and his travels around the world with journalist [[Joel Warner]].&lt;ref name="amazon.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Humor-Code-Global-Search/dp/1451665415|title=The Humor Code: A Global Search for What Makes Things Funny|first1=search|last1=results|first2=search|last2=results|date=1 April 2014|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|accessdate=18 October 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; McGraw and his work often appears in major media outlets, such as BBC, the Wall Street Journal and Wired magazine. He also gives talks to businesses and the general public.

==Academic career==
McGraw received his Ph.D. from [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] in 2002, at which time he pursued a post-doc at Princeton University with Nobel Laureate  [[Daniel Kahneman]]. In 2004, he joined the faculty at the [[Leeds School of Business]], University of Colorado Boulder. In 2008, he received an appointment (courtesy) in the Department of Psychology and Neuroscience.

At the University of Colorado, McGraw teaches courses in consumer behavior and decision making. He directs the Humor Research Lab (HuRL) and co-directs a virtual research lab, the Moral Research Lab (MoRL) with Daniel Bartels. His research has been published in the [[Journal of Consumer Research]], Journal of Marketing Research, Journal of Consumer Psychology, [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]], and [[Psychological Science]]. McGraw was named a [[Marketing Science Institute]] Young Scholar in 2007.&lt;ref name = "ref15" /&gt;

Outside academic pursuits, McGraw, from 2004 to 2010, served as academic coordinator, assistant coach, and associate head coach of the men’s [[lacrosse]] team at the University of Colorado.&lt;ref name="ref13" /&gt; He was the head coach of the men’s lacrosse club at Princeton University from 2002 to 2004.&lt;ref name="ref14" /&gt;

==The Humor Code==
In 2010, McGraw met journalist [[Joel Warner]], who was fascinated by McGraw's humor research and unified theory of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2014/the_humor_code/what_makes_something_funny_a_bold_new_attempt_at_a_unified_theory_of_comedy.html|title=The Humor Code|first1=Peter|last1=McGraw|first2=Joel|last2=Warner|date=23 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2011, the two created "The Humor Code Project," a two-year, 91,000-mile global search for what makes things funny. Their travels took them to Tanzania, Scandinavia, Japan, Israel, Peru, and several other destinations in North America. McGraw and Warner authored [[The Humor Code]], a book about their travels and the experiments they conducted along the way.&lt;ref name="amazon.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="denverpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/lifestyles/ci_25435131/humor-code-takes-unlikely-colorado-pair-around-world|title=“The Humor Code” takes unlikely Colorado pair around the world|date=27 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two maintained multiple blogs about their adventures on [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], [[Huffington Post]], and [[Psychology Today]].&lt;ref name="ref16" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ref17" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ref18" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "ref19" /&gt; McGraw's research and the book have been widely covered by the media, including the Wall Street Journal, NPR, MSNBC, The Boston Globe, Scientific American, The Atlantic, Denver Post, and others.&lt;ref name="ref20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref21" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref22" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref24" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ref25" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/02/the-dark-psychology-of-being-a-good-comedian/284104/|title=The Dark Psychology of Being a Good Comedian|first=Olga|last=Khazan|date=27 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="denverpost.com"/&gt;

==Research Labs==
'''Humor Research Laboratory (HuRL)''' &lt;br /&gt;
HuRL is dedicated to the scientific study of humor and its antecedents and consequences. The lab’s theoretical and methodological base is in the interdisciplinary fields of consumer behavior, emotion, and judgment and decision making, with an emphasis in social and cognitive psychology.

'''Moral Research Laboratory (MoRL)''' &lt;br /&gt;
MoRL is a (virtual) research laboratory that investigates the mental processes underlying morally motivated judgment and choice, with a focus on consumer behavior and implications for public policy.  The lab’s theoretical base is in the interdisciplinary field of judgment and decision making, with an emphasis in social and cognitive psychology.

'''Political [[forecasting]]''' aims at predicting the outcome of elections.

== History ==
People have long been interested in predicting election outcomes. Quotes of betting odds on [[Pope|papal succession]] appear as early as 1503, when such wagering was already considered “an old practice.”&lt;ref&gt;Frederic J. Baumgartner. ''Behind Locked Doors: A History of Papal Elections''. New York, Palgrave, 2003 (pages 88 and 250).&lt;/ref&gt; Political betting also has a long history in Great Britain. As one prominent example, Charles James Fox, the late-eighteenth-century Whig statesman, was known as an inveterate gambler. His biographer, George Otto Trevelyan, noted that“(f)or ten years, from 1771 onwards, Charles Fox betted frequently, largely, and judiciously, on the social and political occurrences of the time.”&lt;ref&gt;George Otto Trevelyan. ''The Early History of Charles James Fox''. New York, Harper &amp; Brothers, 1880 (page 416).&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of scientific polling in 1936, betting odds in the [[United States]] correlated strongly to vote results.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Erikson and Christopher Wlezien. ''Markets vs. polls as election predictors: An historical assessment''. Electoral Studies 31 (2012) 532–539. Elsevier, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1936, [[opinion poll]]s have been a basic part of political forecasting. More recently, [[prediction market]]s have been formed, starting in 1988 with [[Iowa Electronic Markets]].

With the advent of statistical techniques, electoral data have become increasingly easy to handle. It is no surprise, then, that election forecasting has become a big business, for polling firms, news organizations, and betting markets as well as academic students of politics.&lt;ref name ="ef"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0023.xml|title= Election forecasting|last1= Stegmaier|first1= Mary|last2= Norpoth|first2= Helmut|date= 2013-09-30|access-date=2016-09-26|doi =10.1093/obo/9780199756223-0023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic scholars have constructed models of voting behavior to forecast the outcomes of elections. These forecasts are derived from theories and empirical evidence about what matters to voters when they make electoral choices. The forecast models typically rely on a few predictors in highly aggregated form, with an emphasis on phenomena that change in the short-run, such as the state of the economy, so as to offer maximum leverage for predicting the result of a specific election.&lt;ref name = "ef"/&gt;

An early successful model which is still being used is [[The Keys to the White House]] by [[Allan Lichtman]]. Election forecasting in the United States was first brought to the attention of the wider public by [[Nate Silver]] and his [[FiveThirtyEight]] website in [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]]. Currently, there are many competing models trying to predict the outcome of elections in the United States, the [[United Kingdom]], and elsewhere.

== Methods ==
===Averaging polls===

Combining poll data lowers the forecasting mistakes of a poll.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred G. Cuzan, J. Scott Armstrong, and Randall Jones, [http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html "Combining Methods to Forecast the 2004 Presidential Election: The PollyVote"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130123102051/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/PollyVote/index.php/pollys-archive/polly-2004.html |date=2013-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Political forecasting models include averaged poll results, such as the [[RealClearPolitics]] poll average.

===Poll damping===

Poll damping is when incorrect indicators of public opinion are not used in a forecast model. For instance, early in the campaign, polls are poor measures of the future choices of voters. The poll results closer to an election are a more accurate prediction.  Campbell&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=James E.|title=Polls and Votes|journal=American Politics Quarterly|date=October 1996|volume=24|issue=4|pages=408–433|doi=10.1177/1532673X9602400402|url=http://apr.sagepub.com/content/24/4/408.abstract|accessdate=11 June 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; shows the power of poll damping in political forecasting.

===Nomenclature===

When discussing the likelihood of a particular electoral outcome, political forecasters tend to use one of a small range of shorthand phrases.&lt;ref name="rollcall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://media.cq.com/electionguide/|title=Election Guide 2018|publisher=Roll Call Politics|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cookpolitical.com/ratings/senate-race-ratings|title=2018 Senate Race Ratings|date=24 August 2018|publisher=[[Cook Political Report]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp/2018/08/17/here-are-the-house-seats-most-likely-to-flip-according-to-election-rating-systems/|title=Here are the House seats most likely to flip, according to election rating systems|last=Bump|first=Philip|date=17 August 2018|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=17 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These include:

*'''Solid''' (e.g., "Solid Republican"), also '''Safe'''.  Very unlikely that the party which currently holds the seat will change in the upcoming election.
*'''Likely''' (e.g., "Likely Democrat"), also '''Favored'''.  It is not thought at the moment that the seat will be particularly competitive, and hence the party is likely to remain unchanged, but there is a possibility this may alter. 
*'''Lean''' (e.g., "Leans Independent"). One candidate / party has a slight advantage in polling and forecasting, but other outcomes are possible.
*'''Tilt'''.  Used less widely than the other terms, but indicates a very small advantage to one or another party.&lt;ref name="rollcall"/&gt;
*'''Toss-Up'''. These are the seats that are considered to be the most competitive, with more than one party having a good chance of winning.

== Markets ==
[[Prediction market]]s show very accurate forecasts of an election outcome. One example is the [[Iowa Electronic Markets]]. In a study, 964 election polls were compared with the five US presidential elections from 1988 to 2004. [http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf Berg et al. (2008)] showed that the Iowa Electronic Markets topped the polls 74% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biz.uiowa.edu/faculty/trietz/papers/long%20run%20accuracy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, damped polls have been shown to top prediction markets. Comparing damped polls to forecasts of the Iowa Electronic Markets, [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090725101900/http://www.forecastingprinciples.com/Political/PDFs/EriksonWlezien_Markets_AAPOR_for_POLLY.pdf Erikson and Wlezien (2008)] showed that the damped polls outperform all markets or models.

== Regression models ==
Political scientists and economists oftentimes use [[regression analysis|regression models]] of past elections. This is done to help forecast the votes of the political parties – for example, Democrats and Republicans in the US. The information helps their party’s next presidential candidate forecast the future. Most models include at least one public opinion variable, a trial heat poll, or a presidential approval rating.
Bayesian statistics can also be used to estimate the posterior distributions of the true proportion of voters that will vote for each candidate in each state, given both the polling data available and the previous election results for each state.  Each poll can be weighted based on its age and its size, providing a highly dynamic forecasting mechanism as Election day approaches.   http://electionanalytics.cs.illinois.edu/ is an example of a site that employs such methods.&lt;ref&gt;1.	Rigdon, S., Jacobson, S.H., Cho, W.T., Sewell, E.C., Rigdon, C.J., 2009, “A Bayesian Prediction Model for the United States Presidential Election,” American Politics Research, 37(4), 700-724.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Proactive law''' seeks a new approach to legal issues in businesses and societies. Instead of perceiving law as a constraint that companies and people in general need to comply with, '''proactive law''' considers law as an instrument that can create success and foster sustainable relationships, which in the end carries the potential to increase value for companies, individuals, and societies in general.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The word [[proactive]] is the opposite of reactive, meaning that the approach to law is based on an [[ex ante]] view rather than an [[ex post]] view. According to the dictionary of [[Merriam-Webster]], the word proactive refers to ''acting in anticipation of future problems, needs, or changes''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proactive.&lt;/ref&gt;
Thus, the proactive law approach challenges the traditional backwards and failure oriented approach to law by acting in [[67th World Science Fiction Convention|anticipation]] of legal [[disputes]], taking control of potential problems, providing solutions, and self-initiation, instead of reacting to failures and shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012) 1. ed. Tilst, DJØF Publishing, Jurist- og Økonomforbundets Forlag. p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotbed of the proactive law movement is the Nordic countries and Finland in particular. The movement took off in the late 1990s and is almost similar to the American movement – Law as a Competitive Source. Both of these parallel evolutions are founded on the work of [[Louis M. Brown]], developed in the 1950s known as the [[preventive]] approach to law.

== From Preventive Law to Proactive Law ==
The proactive law movement has become more visible in recent years, but the idea of an [[ex ante]] view is not new. It is generally known that the earlier a dispute or a potential dispute is addressed, the better the chances of a fair, just and prompt solution.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Louis M. Brown]] was the first to introduce the [[ex ant]]e view in his ground-laying book “Preventive Law”.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950).&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he identified and organized the preventive law into a distinctive way of thinking, he was not the inventor of this approach. It has been, and still is, well known to many legal professionals and every business manager that:

“It usually costs less to avoid getting into trouble than to pay for getting out of trouble.”&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Louis M.: Preventive Law, (1950). p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the general principles of proactive law requires understanding the core principles of [[preventive law]], as these principles create the foundation for proactive law and [[proactive contracting]]. [[Edward Dauer]] identifies four core principles of preventive law:&lt;ref&gt;Dauer E. A., Four Principles for a Theory of Preventive Law, p. 13-35&lt;/ref&gt;

* Predicting human behavior to anticipate and account for what people will do, and by doing so, prevents litigation. This improves personal and business relationships, and constitutes an essential part of the preventive law.
* Conflict management—preventive law draws parallels from the medical world, e.g., successful medical treatment is prophylactic.
* Embracement of risks: Instead of focusing solely on reducing one or a few risks to zero, the preventive law approach strives to reduce the overall sum of risk.
* Preventive legal service: Lawyers and in-house counsels must participate with others in multi-disciplinary teams in the planning of business ventures. Bringing legal expertise in earlier helps detect and prevent legal problems.

The proactive law movement encompasses the basic principles of preventive law stated above, namely preventing what is not desirable, and keeping problems and risks from materializing.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Thus, as proactive law consists of preventive law, the characteristics above constitute the foundation of proactive law.

=== The Promotive Dimension ===
To this preventive dimension of law, proactive law adds a second aspect, which is often neglected in traditional law – known as the ''[[promotive]] dimension''.

The nature of the promotive dimension is positive and constructive and promotes what is desirable while encouraging good behavior. This is where we find the distinction to preventive law. 
In a legal context, proactive law emphasizes the importance of collaboration between legal professionals and other disciplines to achieve the desired goals in circumstances where legal expertise collaborates with other disciplines. Proactive law therefore emphasizes the need for dialogue between different understandings. In a medical context, the preventive law prevents ill health, while proactive law promotes well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Sorsa K. (ed.): Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proactive law approach is based on legal certainty, [[literacy]], and cross-professional collaboration to “localize the mines and preventing them from exploding.”&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to navigating past the mines, the legal professionals should create economic value, and thus must be outcome-orientated to exploit the promotive dimension. Lawyers and [[in-house counsel]] thus must act to achieve results by watching for changes or opportunities and setting improved goals. To do so, legal professionals must highlight opportunities to build a solid business foundation, roadmaps for performance, trust, and better sustainable relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides achieving these business goals, it is important to focus on legal [[risk management]] to prevent disputes. Many legal disputes arise due to misunderstandings and disappointed expectations. However, careful attention to legal clarity along with early warning mechanisms, and enhanced collaboration between business partners, through establishment of common goals, avoids the business from getting to the stage of dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is essential in proactive law that legal professionals, managers, and other involved stakeholders collaborate on a cross-professional basis to avoid disputes. In addition to avoiding disputes, it is also important to promote creative thinking. To develop new ideas, and concepts that correspond to the needs, problems or challenges, it is necessary to look towards the future rather than the past, maybe by using already known approaches, but also non-existing approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Proactive Management and Proactive Business Law – A Handbook. (2011) 1. ed., Turku: Tampereen Yliopistopaino Oy – Juvenes Print. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; This invites businesses, authorities and researchers to develop solutions through creative thinking.

Thus, proactive law is about problem-solving, detecting real-life causes for potential misunderstandings and failures, but most of all it is about fostering and promoting fruitful and sustainable relationships that enables the stakeholders to reach their goals, creating value for business, individuals, and society as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Berger-Walliser, G. &amp; Østergaard, K.: Proactive Law – in a Business Environment. (2012), p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proactive Law in Legislation ==

An indication that Proactive Law is gaining prominence is the fact that the [[European Commission]] has published an [[opinion]] on Proactive Law.

The EESC urges a [[paradigm]] shift, as the time has come to give up the centuries-old reactive approach to law and to adopt a pro active approach. It is time to look at law in a different way: to look forward rather than back, to focus on how the law is used and oper ates in everyday life and how it is received in the community it seeks to regulate. While responding to and resolving problems remain important, preventing causes of problems is vital, along with serving the needs and facilitating the productive interaction of citizens and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

By its very nature, the Community legal system is precisely the type of area in which the proactive approach should be adopted when planning, drawing up and implementing laws; against this backdrop, the EESC would argue that rules and regu lations are not the only way nor always the best way to achieve the desired objectives; at times, the regulator may best support valuable goals by refraining from regulating and, where appropri ate, encouraging self-regulation and co-regulation. This being the case, the fundamental principles of [[subsidiarity]], [[proportionality (law)|proportionality]], [[precaution]] and [[sustainability]] take on new importance and a new dimension.

The EESC believes that the single market can benefit greatly when EU law and its makers — [[legislators]] and administrators in the broadest sense — shift their focus from inward, from inside the legal system, rules and institutions, to outward, to the users of the law: to society, citizens and businesses that the legal system is intended to serve.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

While the transposition and implementation of laws are important steps towards better regulation at EU level, regulatory success should be measured by how the goals are achieved at the level of the users of the law, EU citizens and businesses. The laws should be communicated in ways that are meaningful to their intended audience, first and foremost to those whose behaviour is affected and not just to the relevant institutions and administrators.

The application of the Proactive Law approach should be considered systematically in all lawmaking and implementation within the EU. The EESC strongly believes that by making this approach not only part of the Better Regulation agenda, and but also a priority for legislators and administrators at the EU, national and regional levels, it would be possible to build a strong legal foundation for individuals and businesses to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2009:175:0026:0033:EN:PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proactive Law in a Business Context==

While Proactive Law in general has gained increased attention at the highest legislatory authorities, businesses seem to be the first movers in this developing research field.

When Proactive Law is adapted to businesses the approach is called [[Proactive Contracting]] and Proactive [[Contract Management]]. The idea is that [[Proactive Contracting]] may constitute a sustainable [[competitive advantage]], when implemented thoroughly.

In recent years law has gained increased prominence as a source of competitive advantage to businesses. This prominence originated with the work of scholars and professionals in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]]. In the US, research of Robert Bird has contributed to the movement of Law as a [[Competitive Advantage]]. 
Robert Bird uses a strategy framework to analyze the attributes of law necessary to obtain a competitive advantage. In Europe, the proactive law movement constitutes the same. 
As contracts and contract law are major components of successful [[R&amp;D]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[operations management]], [[outsourcing]] etc., it is important that the contracts and contracting processes involved are successful. 
In the words of [[Tim Cummins]], [[CEO]] of the IACCM, “contracts lie at the heart of most business relationships, certainly within Western [[cultures]] and [[economies]], and increasingly among all companies or entities that seek to operate in an international market”.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins, T. (2006): Best Practices In Commercial Contracting, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

As international trading grows in value and quantity, it is important for businesses to excel in contracting. Businesses that can manage contracting successfully have a competitive advantage [[ceteris paribus]].

By incorporating both a [[preventive]] and a [[promotive]] focus, the proactive law movement encourages both legal goals, which are often preventive—and business goals, which tend to be promotive.&lt;ref&gt;Siedel, G. J. &amp; Haapio, H.: Using Proactive Law for Competitive Advantages, (2010) p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt;

By combining these two approaches to reaching goals, businesses take advantage of both the preventive focus and the promotive focus.
[[Tory Higgins]] has developed a [[psychological]] theory called the [[Regulatory Focus Theory]] that focuses on motivations and how people tend to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, E. T.: Promotion and Prevention: Regulatory Focus as a Motivational Principle. (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

The two different orientations towards goal achievement, which have been recognized by [[Tory Higgins]], are:

(1) a preventive focus that emphasizes [[safety]], [[Legal liability|responsibility]] and [[security]], and

(2) a promotive focus that emphasizes [[hopes]], [[accomplishments]], and [[advancements]].

Thus, the way of businesses to pursuing a goal depends on whether their approach is [[preventive]] or [[promotive]]. According to Mayer and [[Weber]], people with a preventive focus view goals as minimal targets that produce a low-intensity response when the goal is achieved.  On the other hand, people with a promotive approach see goals as maximal targets. Thus, “achievement of the goal results in feelings of high-intensity happiness instead of low-intensity calm”.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, K. J. &amp; Weber, L.: Unpacking Contract Capabilities: Shaping Behavior by Implementing Appropriate Contract Framing, (2009) p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

If businesses succeed in incorporating both the preventive and promotive approach in reaching their goals, they may able to utilize the advantages of both legal and business goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921054654/http://pure.au.dk/portal-asb-student/da/studentprojects/overcoming-the-challenges-of-future-contracting-through-the-use-of-proactive-law(7972282c-715c-47cc-911e-d32775a8ed2f).html |archivedate=2013-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different grades exist (e.g. thick or viscous, soft). The viscous one is used for standard stopcocks and ground joins. The soft grade is for large stopcocks and ground joints, [[desiccator]]s, and for lower temperature use. Ramsay grease consists of [[paraffin wax]], [[vaseline]], and crude [[natural rubber]], in ratio 1:3:7 to 1:8:16. Due to the rubber content it has less tendency to flow.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry|author=Brauer, G.|date=2012|issue=sv. 1|publisher=Elsevier Science|isbn=9780323161275|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kaa2qeFRXmUC&amp;pg=PA29|page=29|accessdate=2017-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{For|the rapid transit train model in Toronto|S-series (Toronto rapid transit)}}
The '''S-Series of ILS specifications''' is a common denominator for a set of specifications associated to different [[integrated logistics support]] aspects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asd-ssg.org/asd-ils-suite-of-specifications ASD suite of ILS specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally developed by AECMA (French acronym for the Association Européenne des Constructeurs de Matériel Aeronautique, later ASD), the S-Series suite of ILS specifications is managed currently jointly by multinational teams from the [[Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe]] (ASD) and [[Aerospace Industries Association]] (AIA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aia-aerospace.org/national_aerospace_standards/s-series_ils_specifications/ AIA involvement in S-Series ILS specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; reporting to the AIA/ASD ILS Council. The ILS Council established the term '''S-Series (of) ILS specifications''' as the common denominator for all its specifications, and this term was consolidated with the publication of [[SX000i]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sx000i.org Official SX000i project home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

== List of S-Series ILS specifications ==
The specifications encompassing the S-Series of ILS specifications are as follows:

* [[SX000i]] - International guide for the use of the S-Series of '''I'''ntegrated Logistics Support (ILS) specifications
* [[S1000D]] - International specification for technical publications using a common source database
* [http://www.s2000m.org S2000M]	- International specification for material management - Integrated data processing 
* [http://www.s3000l.org S3000L]	- International specification for Logistics Support Analysis - LSA
* [[S4000P]]	- International specification for developing and continuously improving preventive maintenance
* [[S5000F]]	- International specification for in-service data feedback
* [http://www.s6000t.org S6000T]	- International specification for training analysis and design
* [http://www.sx000i.org SX001G]	- Glossary for the S-Series of ILS specifications
* [http://www.sx000i.org SX002D]	- Common data model for the S-Series ILS specifications
* SX003X	- Interoperability matrix for the S-Series ILS specifications
* SX004G	- Unified Modeling Language (UML) model readers guidance
* SX005G	- S-Series ILS specifications XML schema implementation guidance          
* S1000X	- Input data specification for S1000D
* S2000X	- Input data specification for S2000M
* S3000X	- Input data specification for S3000L
* S4000X	- Input data specification for S4000P
* S6000X	- Input data specification for S6000T

== Specification number encoding ==
The encoding of the specifications is inspired by the [[Dewey Decimal Classification]] (DDC) of human knowledge. Transversal specifications are encoded with an "X" instead of a number, so as to represent the "10" used in [[Roman numerals]]. The initial "S" stands for specification, and the last letter indicates a keyword within the title, as highlighted in the list above. Exceptions to this rule are S1000D (where the "D" stands for [[documentation]]) and the specifications ending in "X", which represents "E'''x'''change". Though all letters are upper case, [[SX000i]] has a lower case ending letter for improved readability and to prevent confusion with an "l" in certain fonts.

== Other associated specifications ==
Though strictly speaking it is not one of the S-Series specifications, [[ASD-STE100]] is often associated to them because of its common origin with the S-Series of ILS specifications.

== Integration of the specification and with other domains ==
The S-Series of ILS specifications have in the past years made a significant effort to be interoperable, as this was not always necessarily true in the past. In that context, SX000i defines the common ILS process to which all the specifications will adhere, and SX002D defines a common data model that binds the data models of the different specifications together. This integration has ensured that the specifications have been included in the ASD Strategic Standardization Group (SSG) Radar Chart&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asd-ssg.org/radar-chart ASD Strategic Standardization Group (SSG) Radar Chart]&lt;/ref&gt; as adopted.

In order to maintain the future interoperability of the specifications, [[SX000i]] establishes in its chapter 4 the governance of the S-Series ILS specifications and a common change process. A common unified S-Series ILS Specifications commenting tool was also established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sx00i.org/CPF Unified S-Series ILS Specifications Commenting Tool]&lt;/ref&gt;

The S-Series of ILS specifications are also involved in the development of the new ISO 10303-239 (AP239) PLCS Edition 3 project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ap239.org/ ISO 10303-239 “Product Life Cycle Support” Edition 3 project]&lt;/ref&gt; so as to integrate with the [[ISO 10303]] STEP architecture and non-support domains such as Engineering or Manufacturing. The representatives of the S-Series in the AP239 Edition 3 project are members of the Data Modeling and Exchange Working Group (DMEWG), which is responsible for the development of SX001G, SX002D, SX003X, SX004G and SX005G.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sx000i.org/DMEWG.html DMEWG home page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Materials, at the University of Manchester''' is a school of [[Materials science|Materials Science]] at the [[University of Manchester]]. The school is one of the largest departments in Europe that has a material science focus.{{fact|date=August 2016}} This is reflected by an annual research income of around £7m,{{fact|date=August 2016}} 60 academic staff, and a population of 150 research students and 60 [[postdoctoral research]] staff. 

==Teaching==
The School offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in all aspects of materials including materials engineering, biomaterials, corrosion protection, technical textiles, fashion and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419043134/http://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk/|archivedate=2016-04-19|url=http://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk|website=materials.manchester.ac.uk|publisher=University of Manchester|location=Manchester|title=School of Materials, University of Manchester|author=Anon|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
In the 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise]] both the Material Science and Corrosion and Protection centre gained the highest rating, 5*. The School of Materials has also been ranked first for research power in the UK.

The school is unusual in that the Materials Science departments at [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST)]] and the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] were already joint before the merger of those two institutions in 2004.  The School also incorporates the Textiles, Paper Science and Corrosion &amp; Protection departments which were formerly part of UMIST.

==Senior staff==
{{As of|2016}} the head of school is Professor William Sampson.&lt;ref name=sampson&gt;{{cite web|first=Williams|last=Sampson|year=2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012000055/http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/william.sampson/|title=Professor William Sampson (BSc (Hons), PhD, FIMMM)|publisher=University of Manchester|location=Manchester|website=manchester.ac.uk|archivedate=2015-10-12|url=http://www.manchester.ac.uk/research/william.sampson/}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2011 to 2015 the head of School was Professor [[Paul O'Brien (chemist)|Paul O'Brien]] FRS.&lt;ref name=obrien&gt;{{Who's Who | surname = O’BRIEN |othernames = Prof. Paul | id = U59835 | volume = 2013 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other senior academic staff include [[Philip J. Withers]] FRS, the [[Regius Professor]] of Materials.

==Buildings==
The Manchester Materials Science centre was one of the main buildings of the school until its demolition in 2016. {{As of|2016}} the centre will be replaced with the Manchester Engineering Campus Development (MECD).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6121">'''Soil and Water Bioengineering''' is a discipline of [[civil engineering]]. It pursues technological, ecological, economic as well as design goals and seeks to achieve these primarily by making use of living materials, i.e. seeds, plants, part of plants and plant communities, and employing them in near–natural constructions while exploiting the manifold abilities inherent in plants.
Soil [[bioengineering]] may sometimes be a substitute for classical engineering works; however, in most cases it is a meaningful and necessary method of complementing the latter.
Its application suggests itself in all fields of soil and [[hydraulic engineering]], especially for [[slope stabilization|slope]] and embankment stabilization and [[erosion control]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiechtl, H. M. (Trans. N.K. Horstmann, 1980). Bioengineering for Land Reclamation and Conservation. University of Alberta Press. Edmonton. Alberta. 404 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil bioengineering is the use of living plant materials to provide some engineering function. Soil bioengineering is an effective tool for treatment of a variety of unstable and / or eroding sites. Soil bioengineering techniques have been used for many centuries. More recently Schiechtl (1980) has encouraged the use of soil bioengineering with a variety of European examples. Soil bioengineering is now widely practiced throughout the world for the treatment of erosion and unstable slopes.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, D.H. and A.T. Leiser. 1982. Biotechnical Slope Protection and Erosion Control. Van Nostrand Reinhold Company Inc. Scarborough, Ontario, 271 pp. reprinted by Krieger Publishing Co. Malabar, Florida).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, J. and J. Hellin. 1996. Bio-engineering for Effective Road Maintenance in the Caribbean. Natural Resources Institute. The University of Greenwich. United Kingdom.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields of Application and Plants for Soil Bioengineering Control Works ==
Soil Bioengineering methods can be applied wherever the plants which are used as living building materials are able to grow well and develop.
This is the case in tropical, subtropical and [[temperate zone]]s whereas there are obvious limits in dry and cold regions, i.e. where arid, semi–arid and frost zones prevail. In exceptional cases, lack of water may be compensated for by watering or [[irrigation]].
In Europe, dry conditions limiting application exist in the Mediterranean as well as in some inner alpine and eastern European snowy regions. However, limits are most frequently imposed in alpine and arctic regions. These can usually be clearly noticed by the limited growth of woody plants ([[forest line|forest]], tree and shrub lines) and the upper limits of closed [[turf]] [[vegetative cover|cover]]. The more impoverished a region is in species, the less suited it is for the application of bioengineering methods.

== Functions and Effects of Soil Bioengineering Structures ==
===Technical functions===
*protection of soil surface from erosion by wind, precipitation, frost and flowing water
*protection from rock fall
*elimination or binding of destructive mechanical forces
*reduction of flow velocity along banks
*surface and/or deep soil cohesion and stabilization
*drainage
*protection from wind
*aiding the deposition of snow, drift sand and sediments
*increasing soil roughness and thus preventing avalanche release

Apart from these, ecological functions are gaining in importance, particularly as these can be fulfilled to a very limited extent only by classical engineering constructions.

===Ecological functions===
*improvement of water regime by improved soil interception and storage capability as well as water
*consumption by plants
*[[soil drainage]]
*protection from wind
*protection from ambient [[air pollution]]
*mechanical [[soil amelioration]] by the roots of plants
*balancing of temperature conditions in near–ground layers of air and in the soil
*[[shading]]
*improvement of nutrient content in the soil and thus of soil fertility on previously raw soils
*balancing of snow deposits
*[[noise protection]]
*yield increase on neighbouring cropland

===Landscaping functions===
*healing of wounds inflicted on the landscape by disasters and humans (exploitation of mineral resources, construction work, deposition of overburden, tunnel excavation material, industrial and domestic waste)
*integration of structures into the landscape
*concealment of offending structures
*enrichment of the landscape by creating new features and structures, shapes and colours of vegetation

===Economic effects===

Bioengineering control works are not always necessarily cheaper in construction when compared to classical engineering structures. However, when taking into account their lifetime including their service and maintenance, they will normally turn out to be more economical.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} Their special advantages are:

*lower construction costs compared to “hard” constructions
*lower maintenance and rehabilitation costs
*creation of useful green areas and woody plant populations on previously derelict land
*Useful for income generation 
The result of soil bioengineering protection works are living systems which develop further and maintain their balance by natural succession (i.e. by dynamic self–control, without artificial input of energy). If the right living but also non–living building materials and the appropriate types of construction are chosen, exceptionally high sustainability requiring little maintenance effort can be achieved. &lt;ref&gt;Schiechtl, H.M. and R.

[[File:South-pointing chariot (Science Museum model).jpg|thumb|Exhibit in the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London, England. This conjectural model chariot incorporates a [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gear.]]
{{Chinese|pic=|picsize=|piccap=|t=指南車|s=指南车|p=zhǐ nán chē|j=zi2 naam4 gui1|y=jí nàahm guī}}

The '''south-pointing chariot''' (or '''carriage''') was an ancient Chinese two-wheeled vehicle that carried a movable pointer to indicate the [[south]], no matter how the chariot turned. Usually, the pointer took the form of a [[doll]] or figure with an outstretched arm. The chariot was supposedly used as a [[compass]] for [[navigation]] and may also have had other purposes.

The ancient Chinese invented a mobile-like armored cart used in from the 5th century BC called the [[Dongwu Che]] ({{zh|c=洞屋车}}). It was used for the purpose of protecting warriors on the battlefield. The Chinese war wagon was designed as a kind of mobile protective cart with a shed-like roof. It would serve to be rolled up to city fortifications to provide protection for [[sappers]] digging underneath to weaken a wall's foundation. The early Chinese war wagon became the basis of technologies for the making of ancient Chinese south-pointing chariots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Fighting Techniques of the Oriental World 1200-1860 |last=Haskew |first= Michael E |last2=Jorgensen |first2= Christer |last3=McNab |first3= Chris |last4=Niderost |first4= Eric |publisher=Metro Books |year=2008 |isbn= 978-1905704965 |page=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=A History of Chinese Science and Technology |last=Lu |first=	Yongxiang |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=978-3662441626 |volume=3 |publication-date=October 20, 2014 |page=516 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are legends of earlier south-pointing chariots, but the first reliably documented one was created by the Chinese mechanical engineer [[Ma Jun]] (c. 200&amp;ndash;265 CE) of [[Cao Wei]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]]. No ancient chariots still exist, but many extant ancient Chinese texts mention them, saying they were used intermittently until about 1300 CE. Some include information about their inner components and workings.

There were probably several types of south-pointing chariot which worked differently. In most or all of them, the rotating road wheels mechanically operated a [[gear]]ed mechanism to keep the pointer aimed correctly. The mechanism had no magnets and did not automatically detect which direction was south. The pointer was aimed southward by hand at the start of a journey. Subsequently, whenever the chariot turned, the mechanism rotated the pointer relative to the body of the chariot to counteract the turn and keep the pointer aiming in a constant direction, to the south. Thus the mechanism did a kind of directional [[dead reckoning]], which is inherently prone to cumulative errors and uncertainties. Some chariots' mechanisms may have had [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears. If so, it was probably the first use of differentials anywhere in the world.

==Historical texts==

===Earliest sources===
[[File:指南車圖 (三才圖會).jpg|thumb|upright|An image of a south-pointing chariot from ''[[Sancai Tuhui]]'' (first published 1609)]]

The south-pointing chariot, a mechanical-geared, wheeled vehicle used to discern the southern cardinal direction (without magnetics), was given a brief description by Ma's contemporary [[Fu Xuan]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 40"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary 3rd century CE source of the ''[[Weilüe]]'', written by the East Han Dynasty politician [[Yuan Huan]] also described the south-pointing chariot of belonging to the Chinese mechanical engineer and politician [[Ma Jun]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288" /&gt; The [[Jin Dynasty (265&amp;ndash;420)|Jin Dynasty]] (265&amp;ndash;420 CE) era text of the ''Shu Zheng Ji'' (Records of Military Expeditions), written by Guo Yuansheng, recorded that south-pointing chariots were often stored in the northern [[gatehouse]] of the Government Workshops (Shang Fang) of the capital city.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288" /&gt; However, the later written ''[[Book of Song|Song Shu]]'' (''Book of Song'') (6th century CE) recorded the south-pointing chariot's design and use in further detail, as well as creating the background legend of the device's (supposed) use long before Ma's time, in the [[Western Zhou Dynasty]] (1050&amp;ndash;771 BCE). The book also provided a description of the south-pointing chariot's re-invention and use in times after Ma Jun and the Three Kingdoms. The 6th century CE text, translated by the British scientist and historian [[Joseph Needham]], reads as follows (the south-pointing chariot is referred to as the south-pointing carriage):

{{cquote|The south-pointing carriage was first constructed by the Duke of Zhou (beginning of the 1st millennium [[Before Common Era|BC]]) as a means of conducting homewards certain envoys who had arrived from a great distance beyond the frontiers. The country to be traversed was a boundless plain, in which people lost their bearings as to east and west, so (the Duke) caused this vehicle to be made in order that the ambassadors should be able to distinguish north and south. The ''Gui Gu Zi'' book says that the people of the [[Zheng (state)|State of Zheng]], when collecting jade, always carried with them a 'south-pointer', and by means of this were never in doubt (as to their position). During the [[Qin Dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han Dynasty|Former Han]] dynasties, however, nothing more was heard of the vehicle. In the [[Han Dynasty|Later Han]] period, [[Zhang Heng]] re-invented it, but owing to the confusion and turmoil at the close of the dynasty it was not preserved.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 286"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 286.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|In the State of Wei, (in the [[Three Kingdoms|San Guo]] period) Gaotong Long and Qin Lang were both famous scholars; they disputed about the south-pointing carriage before the court, saying that there was no such thing, and that the story was nonsense. But during the Qing-long reign period (233&amp;ndash;237 AD) the emperor Ming Di commissioned the scholar Ma Jun to construct one, and he duly succeeded. This again was lost during the troubles attending the establishment of the [[Jin Dynasty (265&amp;ndash;420)|Jin Dynasty]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 286 287"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 286&amp;ndash;287.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|Later on, [[Shi Hu]] (emperor of the [[Jie (ethnic group)|Jie]] [[Later Zhao]] Dynasty) had one made by Xie Fei, and again Linghu Sheng made one for Yao Xing (emperor of the [[Later Qin]] dynasty). The latter was obtained by emperor An Di of the Jin in the 13th year of the Yi-xi reign-period (417 AD), and it finally came into the hands of emperor [[Emperor Wu of Liu Song|Wu Di]] of the [[Liu Song Dynasty]] when he took over the administration of [[Chang'an]]. Its appearance and construction was like that of a drum-carriage ([[odometer]]). A wooden figure of a man was placed at the top, with its arm raised and pointing to the south, (and the mechanism was arranged in such a way that) although the carriage turned round and round, the pointer-arm still indicated the south. In State processions, the south-pointing carriage led the way, accompanied by the imperial guard.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|These vehicles, constructed as they had been by barbarian ([[Qiang people|Qiang]]) workmen, did not function particularly well. Though called south-pointing carriages, they very often did not point true, and had to negotiate curves step by step, with the help of someone inside to adjust the machinery. The ingenious man from [[Fanyang]], Zi [[Zu Chongzhi]] frequently said, therefore, that a new (and properly automatic) south-pointing carriage ought to be constructed. So towards the close of the Sheng-Ming reign period (477&amp;ndash;479 AD) the emperor [[Emperor Shun of Liu Song|Shun Di]], during the premiership of the Prince of Qi, commissioned (Zi Zu Chongzhi) to make one, and when it was completed it was tested by Wang Seng-qian, military governor of Tanyang, and Liu Hsiu, president of the Board of Censors. The workmanship was excellent, and although the carriage was twisted and turned in a hundred directions, the hand never failed to point to the south. Under the Jin, moreover, there had also been a south-pointing ship.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287"/&gt;}}

The last sentence of the passage is of great interest for navigation at sea, since the magnetic [[compass]] used for seafaring navigation was not used until the time of [[Shen Kuo]] (1031&amp;ndash;1095). Although the ''Song Shu'' text describes earlier precedents of the south-pointing chariot before the time of Ma Jun, this is not entirely credible, as there are no pre-Han or Han Dynasty era texts that describe the device.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 287 288"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 287&amp;ndash;288.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the first known source to describe stories of its legendary use during the Zhou period was the ''Gu Jin Zhu'' book of [[Cui Bao]] (c. 300 CE), written soon after the Three Kingdoms era.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 288&lt;/ref&gt; Cui Bao also wrote that the intricate details of construction for the device were once written in the ''Shang Fang Gu Shi'' (''Traditions of the Imperial Workshops''), but the book was lost by his time.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 288"/&gt;

===Japan===
The invention of the south-pointing chariot also made its way to [[Japan]] by the 7th century. The ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (The Chronicles of Japan) of 720 CE described the earlier Chinese [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s [[Zhi Yu]] and [[Zhi You]] constructing several south-pointing Chariots for [[Emperor Tenji]] of Japan in 658 CE.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 289"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 289.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed up by several more chariot devices built in 666 CE as well.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 289"/&gt;

===''Song Shi''===

The south-pointing chariot was also combined with the earlier Han Dynasty era invention of the [[odometer]] (also [[Greco-Roman]]), a mechanical device used to measure distance traveled, and found in all modern [[automobile]]s. It was mentioned in the [[Song Dynasty]] (960&amp;ndash;1279 CE) historical text of the ''Song Shi'' (compiled in 1345) that the engineers [[Yan Su]] (in 1027 CE) and [[Wu Deren]] (in 1107 CE) both created south-pointing chariots, which it details as follows.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 291.&lt;/ref&gt; (In Needham's translation, inches and feet (ft) are used as units of distance. 1 inch is 25.4 millimetres. 1&amp;nbsp;ft is 12 inches or 304.8&amp;nbsp;mm.)

{{cquote|In the 5th year of the Tian-Sheng reign period of the [[Emperor Renzong of Song|emperor Renzong]] (1027 AD), Yan Su, a Divisional Director in the Ministry of Works, made a south-pointing carriage. He memorialised the throne, saying, [after the usual historical introduction]: 'Throughout the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms|Five Dynasties]] and until the reigning dynasty there has been, so far as I know, no one who has been able to construct such a vehicle. But now I have invented a design myself and have succeeded in completing it'.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 291"/&gt;}}

{{cquote|'The method involves using a carriage with a single pole (for two horses). Above the outside framework of the body of the carriage let there be a cover in two stories. Set a wooden image of a ''xian'' (immortal) at the top, stretching out its arm to indicate the south.

After this initial description of Yan Su's device, the text continues to describe the work of Wu Deren, who crafted a wheeled device that would combine the odometer and south-pointing chariot:

{{cquote|It was ordered that the method should be handed down to the (appropriate) officials so that the machine might be made. In the first year of the Da-Guan reign period (1107 AD), the Chamberlain Wu Deren presented specifications of the south-pointing carriage and the carriage with the li-recording drum (odometer). The two vehicles were made, and were first used that year at the great ceremony of the ancestral sacrifice.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 292"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 292.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|The body of the south-pointing carriage was 11.15 ft. (long), 9.5 ft. wide, and 10.9 ft. deep. The carriage wheels were 5.7 ft. in diameter, the [[carriage pole]] 10.5 ft. long, and the carriage body in two stories, upper and lower. In the middle was placed a partition. Above there stood a figure of a ''xian'' holding a rod, on the left and right were tortoises and cranes, one each on either side, and four figures of boys each holding a tassel. In the upper story there were at the four corners [[trip-mechanism]]s, and also 13 horizontal wheels, each 1.85 ft. in diameter, 5.55 ft. in circumference, with 32 teeth at intervals of 1.8 inches apart.

{{cquote|In the lower story were 13 wheels. In the middle was the largest horizontal wheel, 3.8 ft. in diameter, 11.4 ft. in circumference, and having 100 teeth at intervals of 2.1 inches apart.

== Chariots with differential gears ==

===Background and explanation===
[[File:Transmission diagram.JPG|thumb|An illustration of a differential between the drive shaft (at bottom right) and driving wheels of an automobile]]

There is a widely believed hypothesis that most, if not all, south-pointing chariots worked by means of [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] gears.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} A differential is an assembly of gears, nowadays used in almost all automobiles except some electric and hybrid-electric ones, which has three shafts linking it to the external world. They are conveniently labelled A, B, and C. The gears cause the rotation speed of Shaft A to be proportional to the ''sum'' of the rotation speeds of Shafts B and C. There are no other limitations on the rotation speeds of the shafts.

In an automobile, Shaft A is connected to the engine (through the transmission), and Shafts B and C are connected to two road wheels, one on each side of the vehicle. When the vehicle turns, the wheel going around the outside of the turning curve has to roll further and rotate faster than the wheel on the inside. The differential permits this to happen while both wheels are being driven by the engine. If the sum of the speeds of the wheels is constant, the speed of the engine does not change.

In a south-pointing chariot, according to the hypothesis, Shaft B was connected to one road wheel and Shaft C was connected ''through a direction-reversing gear'' to the other road wheel. This made Shaft A rotate at a speed that was proportional to the ''difference'' between the rotation speeds of the two wheels. The pointing doll was connected (possibly through intermediate gears) to Shaft A. When the chariot moved in a straight line, the two wheels turned at equal speeds, and the doll did not rotate. When the chariot turned, the wheels rotated at different speeds (for the same reason as in an automobile), so the differential caused the doll to rotate, compensating for the turning of the chariot.

The hypothesis that there were south-pointing chariots with differential gears originated in the 20th century. People who were familiar with modern (e.g. automotive) uses of differentials interpreted some of the ancient Chinese descriptions in ways that agreed with their own ideas. Essentially, they re-invented the south-pointing chariot, as it had previously been re-invented several times in antiquity. Working chariots that use differentials have been constructed in recent decades. Whether any such chariots existed previously is not known with certainty.

Although the [[Antikythera mechanism#Investigations and reconstructions|Antikythera mechanism]] is believed to have used differential gears, the first true differential gear definitely known to have been used was by Joseph Williamson in 1720.&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 298"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 298.&lt;/ref&gt; He used a differential for correcting the [[equation of time]] for a [[clock]] that displayed both [[Local mean time|mean]] and [[solar time]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 part 2 298" /&gt;

=== Geometrical properties ===
If the south-pointing chariot were built perfectly accurately, using a differential gear, and if it travelled on an Earth that was perfectly smooth, it would have interesting properties. It would be a mechanical compass that transports a direction, given by the pointer, along the path it travels. Mathematically the device performs [[parallel transport]] along the path it travels.

The chariot can be used to detect straight lines or [[geodesics]]. A path on a surface the chariot travels along is a geodesic if and only if the pointer does not rotate with respect to the base of the chariot.

Because of the [[curvature]] of the Earth's surface (due to it being curved around as a globe), the chariot would generally not continue to point due south as it moves. For example, if the chariot moves along a geodesic (as approximated by any [[great circle]]) the pointer should instead stay at a fixed angle to the path. Also, if two chariots travel by different routes between the same starting and finishing points, their pointers, which were aimed in the same direction at the start, usually do not point in the same direction at the finish. Likewise, if a chariot goes around a closed loop, starting and finishing at the same point on the Earth's surface, its pointer generally does not aim in the same direction at the finish as it did at the start. The difference is the [[holonomy]] of the path, and is proportional to the enclosed area. If the journeys are short compared with the radius of the Earth, these discrepancies are small and may have no practical importance. Nevertheless, they show that this type of chariot, based on differential gears, would be an imperfect compass even if constructed exactly and used in ideal conditions.

=== Lack of precision, and implications ===
Real machines are never built perfectly accurately. Simple geometry shows that if the chariot's mechanism is based on a differential gear and if, for example, the width of the track of the chariot (the separation between its wheels) is three metres, and if the wheels are intended to be identical but actually differ in diameter by one part in a thousand, then if the chariot travels one kilometre in a straight line, the "south-pointing" figure will rotate nearly twenty degrees. If it initially points exactly to the south, at the end of the one-kilometre trip it will point almost to the [[Cardinal direction|south-southeast]] or [[Boxing the compass|south-southwest]], depending on which wheel is the larger. If the chariot travels nine kilometres, the figure will end up pointing almost due north. Obviously, this would make it useless as a south-pointing compass. To be a useful navigational tool, the figure would have to rotate no more than a couple of degrees over a journey of a hundred kilometres, but this would require the chariot's wheels to be equal in diameter to within one part in a million. Even if the process of manufacturing the wheels were capable of this precision (which would not be possible with ancient Chinese methods), it is doubtful that the equality of the wheels could be maintained for long as they are subjected to the wear and tear of travelling across open country. Irregularity of the ground would add further errors to the device's functioning.

Considerable scepticism is therefore warranted as to whether this type of south-pointing chariot, using a differential gear for the whole time, was used in practice to navigate over long distances. Conceivably, the south-pointing doll was fixed to the body of the chariot while it was travelling in straight lines, and coupled to the differential only when the chariot was turning. The charioteer could have operated a control to do this just before and after making each turn, or maybe shouted commands to someone inside the chariot who connected and disconnected the doll and the differential. This could have been done without stopping the chariot. If turns were brief and rare, this would have greatly reduced the pointing errors, since they would have accumulated only during the short periods when the doll and differential were connected. However, it raises the problem of how the chariot could have been kept travelling in straight lines with sufficient accuracy without using the pointing doll.

If the real purposes of the chariot and the accounts of it were amusement and impressing visiting foreigners, rather than actual long-distance navigation, then its inaccuracy might not have been important.  Considering that a large mechanical wagon or chariot would be obligated to travel on roads, the destination in question would typically not be in an unknown direction.   The fact that the sources cited above mention that the chariot was placed at the front of processions, its high level of mechanical complexity and fragility, and that it was 'reinvented' several times contribute to the conclusion that it was not used for navigation, as a truly practical and useful navigational tool would not be forgotten or left unused.

== Chariots without differential gears ==

Although the hypothesis that the south-pointing chariot used differential gears has gained wide acceptance, it should be recognized that functional south-pointing chariots without differential gears are possible. The ancient descriptions are often unclear, but they suggest that the Chinese implemented several different designs, at least some of which did not include differentials.

=== Mechanical designs ===

Some of the ancient descriptions suggest that some south-pointing chariots could move in only three ways: straight ahead, or turning left or right with a fixed radius of curvature. A third wheel might have been used to fix the turning radius. If the chariot was turning, the pointing doll was connected by gears to one or other of the two main road wheels (e.g. whichever was on the outside of the curve around which the chariot was moving) so the doll rotated at a fixed speed, relative to the rate of the chariot's movement, to compensate for the predetermined rate of turn. The doll turned in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was connected to it, so its rotation compensated for the chariot turning left or right. This design would have been simpler than using a differential gear.

The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren appear to have used this type of mechanism. (See descriptions quoted from the ''Song Shi'', above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an [[odometer]], there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical gear wheels. A large horizontal gear wheel was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned the space between the uppermost points of the vertical gear wheels. When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small gear wheel was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road wheels. Two small gear wheels were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small gear wheels were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small gear wheel into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small gear wheel was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.

The description does not mention a third road wheel to fix the turning radius, but it is possible that such a wheel was present. No gears would have been attached to it, so perhaps the author of the description did not mention it because he did not realize that it was an important part of the mechanism. Putting such a wheel on the chariot and making it function properly would not have been difficult. It might have been attached to the pole to which the horses were harnessed. Stops would have been provided to limit the motions of the pole to left and right.

If a third road wheel was included, this type of south-pointing chariot could have worked quite accurately as a compass when used for short journeys under good conditions, but if used for long journeys it would have been subject to cumulative errors, like chariots using the differential mechanism.

If in fact there was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so that one of the two wheels was stationary and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A [[brake]] would have helped, but there is no mention of one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.

The ''Song Shi'' description of the gears in Yan Su's chariot, and the numbers of teeth on them, suggests that it worked this way, without a third road wheel. The gear ratios would have been correct if the pointing doll was attached directly to the large horizontal gear wheel, and the track-width of the chariot equalled the diameter of the road wheels. Wu Deren's chariot also appears to have been designed to work this way. The width of the chariot, and therefore presumably the track-width, was greater than the diameter of the wheels. The gear ratios were appropriate for these dimensions.

The charioteer would have had to use great skill to ensure that the radius of each turn of the chariot was correct to make one of the wheels exactly stop rotating. Unless he did this correctly, the pointing doll would not have kept aiming to the south. He would have been able to adjust the direction in which it aimed by making turns that were more or less sharp. This would sometimes have given him opportunities to use the chariot dishonestly. If it was being demonstrated to spectators, for example, and was being driven around in front of them, making many turns, the charioteer, who would have known which way was south, would have been able to make the chariot ''appear to'' work extremely accurately as a compass for long periods. The spectators could have been shown the machinery, and would have seen that the charioteer could not manipulate the doll. They would presumably have been impressed by the apparent accuracy of the mechanism. It is possible that this type of chariot was sometimes constructed with the prime purpose of fraudulently impressing spectators. Possibly, people who built these chariots deceived their own employers with them, which could have gained them fame and fortune provided nobody tried using the chariots for real navigation.

Other mechanical designs for the south-pointing chariot are also possible, including ones that employ a device that is used today, the [[gyrocompass]]. However, there is no indication that the ancient Chinese knew of these.

=== Non-mechanical possibilities ===

Some south-pointing chariots may not have been purely mechanical devices. Someone riding inside the chariot may have used some non-mechanical method of determining the compass directions, and turned the doll on top of the chariot accordingly. There are several methods that could have been used, for example:

* By using a [[Compass#Magnetic compass|magnetic compass]]. The Chinese were using this for navigation by the 11th century CE, when south-pointing chariots were still being made and used.
* By using astronomical observations of the Sun and/or stars, e.g. the [[Pole Star]]. [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese astronomical knowledge]] was extensive.
* By using local knowledge. The person in the chariot may have known the area or had a map or description of it.
* By observing the polarization of light from the sky. Vikings used [[birefringent]] crystals of [[Iceland spar]] to navigate across the Atlantic Ocean by this method at about the same time.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Iceland spar is found in China, as well as in Iceland and some other places. Insects such as bees can respond to sky polarization and use it to find their way home. Whether the Chinese used it is hypothetical, but it is certainly possible.
* By observing light that had been refracted by the Earth's atmosphere. This is one of the techniques that were used by Polynesian navigators to steer ships among Pacific islands. When the surface of the Earth, ocean or ground, is colder than the air above it, a dense layer of air is formed near the surface, which refracts light downward. The result is that light can go around the curvature of the Earth, allowing things to be seen at much greater distances than simple geometry would predict. The images are very distorted, but they can be recognized by skilled navigators. Certain other Polynesian techniques can also be used on land and may have been employed by the Chinese.

Unlike mechanisms that rely on the rotation of road wheels, most of these methods can be used at sea. This may account for the mention (see "Earliest sources" above) that a marine version of the south-pointing chariot existed.

These methods can work accurately over long distances, unlike the mechanical designs for the chariot.

==Necessity of non-mechanical orientation==
[[File:South-pointing chariot, China Court, Ibn Battuta Mall, Dubai.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=A wooden two-wheeled cart supporting a series of wooden peg gears and a metal statue pointing with one outstretched hand.|South-pointing chariot replica at the [[Ibn Battuta Mall]], Dubai]]

Some non-mechanical method of finding the south must have been used when a mechanical south-pointing chariot was [[wiktionary:initialize|initialized]], aiming its pointer to the south at the start of a journey. Any of the methods mentioned above in "Non-mechanical possibilities" could have been used.

If any south-pointing chariot was really used for long-distance navigation, it must have relied (after initialization) on a non-mechanical direction-finding method. It might have been operated non-mechanically by someone riding in it, as outlined above. Alternatively, if it had a mechanical mechanism, it must have been frequently re-initialized non-mechanically to eliminate accumulated errors and uncertainties.

The only chariots that might not have needed non-mechanical methods of finding the south would have been those that were never used for long-distance navigation. If some chariots were used only for amusement or fraud, they could have worked purely mechanically. Even initialization could have been avoided by simply declaring some arbitrary direction to be "south".

== Where they can be seen ==
While none of the historic south-pointing chariots remain, full sized replicas can be found.

The History Museum in [[Beijing]], [[China]], holds a replica based on the mechanism of Yen Su (1027).
The [[National Palace Museum]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], holds a replica based on the Lanchester mechanism of 1932.

Referred to as the "southern pointing man", two replicas can also be seen (and physically experimented with) at the Ontario Science Centre in Toronto, Canada.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12349">The '''terminal investment hypothesis''' is the idea in [[life history theory]] that as an organism's residual reproductive value (or the total reproductive value minus the reproductive value of the current breeding attempt) decreases, its reproductive effort will increase. Thus, as an organism's prospects for survival decreases (through age or an immune challenge, for example), it will invest more in reproduction. This hypothesis is generally supported in animals, although results contrary to it do exist.

The terminal investment hypothesis posits that as residual reproductive value (measured as the total reproductive value minus the reproductive value of the current breeding attempt&lt;ref name="Williams1966"&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0003-0147| volume = 100| issue = 916| pages = 687–690| last = Williams| first = George C.| title = Natural selection, the costs of reproduction, and a refinement of Lack's principle| journal = The American Naturalist| year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;) decreases, reproductive effort increases.&lt;ref name="VelandoDrummond2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Velando|first1=A.|last2=Drummond|first2=H.|last3=Torres|first3=R.|title=Senescent birds redouble reproductive effort when ill: confirmation of the terminal investment hypothesis|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=273|issue=1593|year=2006|pages=1443–1448|issn=0962-8452|doi=10.1098/rspb.2006.3480}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is based off of the cost of reproduction hypothesis, which says that an increase in resources dedicated to current reproduction decreases the potential for future reproduction. But, as the residual reproductive value decreases, the importance of this trade-off decreases, leading to increased investment in the current reproductive attempt.&lt;ref name="CreightonHeflin2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Creighton|first1=J. Curtis|last2=Heflin|first2=Nicholas D.|last3=Belk|first3=Mark C.|title=Cost of reproduction, resource quality, and terminal investment in a burying beetle|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=174|issue=5|year=2009|pages=673–684|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/605963}}&lt;/ref&gt; This terminal investment hypothesis can be illustrated by the equation

&lt;math&gt;\hat{c}=\frac{(a+b)\phi}{(\Phi-\phi)}&lt;/math&gt;,

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is the total reproductive value, &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; the reproductive value of the current breeding attempt, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the proportionate increase in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; resulting from a positive decision (where a ''yes-no'' decision must be made regarding whether or not to increase reproductive effort), &lt;math&gt;\hat{c}&lt;/math&gt; the cost of a positive decision where there is no selective pressure for either a positive decision or negative decision (this variable is also known as the "barely-justified cost"). The variable &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the proportionate loss in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; from a negative decision. The barely-justified cost is thus inversely proportional to the residual reproductive value. When the level of reproductive investment has not reached the point where the equation above is true, more positive decisions about reproductive effort will be made. Thus, as the residual reproductive value decreases, more positive decisions need to be made so the equation is equal.&lt;ref name="Williams1966"/&gt;

&lt;!-- For "In animals" and "In plants", organize studies by date unless it makes sense to do otherwise --&gt;
==In animals==
In animals, most tests of the terminal investment hypothesis are correlations of age and reproductive effort, immune challenges on all age stages, and immune challenges on older ages versus younger ages. The last type of test is considered to be a more reliable measure of senescence's effect on reproductive effort, as younger individuals should reduce reproductive effort to reduce the change of death because of their high future reproductive prospects, while older animals should increase effort because of their low future prospects.&lt;ref name="VelandoDrummond2006"/&gt; Overall, the terminal investment hypothesis is generally supported in a variety of animals.&lt;ref name="KoenigKnops2017"/&gt;
===In birds===
A study on [[blue tit]]s published in 2000 found that individuals injected with a human [[diphtheria]]–[[tetanus]] [[vaccine]] fed their nestlings less than those injected with a [[control group|control]] solution.&lt;ref name="RabergNilsson2000"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Raberg|first1=L.|last2=Nilsson|first2=J.-A.|last3=Ilmonen|first3=P.|last4=Stjernman|first4=M.|last5=Hasselquist|first5=D.|title=The cost of an immune response: vaccination reduces parental effort|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=3|issue=5|year=2000|pages=382–386|issn=1461-023X|doi=10.1046/j.1461-0248.2000.00154.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study published in 2004, [[house sparrow]]s that were injected with a [[Newcastle disease]] vaccine were more likely to lay a replacement clutch after their first clutch had been artificially removed than those that were injected with a control solution.&lt;ref name="BonneaudMazuc2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonneaud|first1=Camille|last2=Mazuc|first2=Jeremy|last3=Chastel|first3=Olivier|last4=Westerdahl|first4=Helena|last5=Sorci|first5=Gabriele|title=Terminal investment induced by immune challenge and fitness traits associated with major histocompatibility complex in the house sparrow|journal=Evolution|volume=58|issue=12|year=2004|pages=2823–2830|issn=0014-3820|doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb01633.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study published in 2006, old [[blue-footed booby|blue-footed boobies]] injected with [[lipopolysaccharide]]s (to challenge the immune system) before laying fledged more young than normal, whereas young individuals fledged less than normal.&lt;ref name="VelandoDrummond2006"/&gt; An increase in maternal effort in immune challenged birds may be mediated by the hormone [[corticosterone]]; a study published in 2015 found that [[house wren]]s injected with lipopolysaccharides increased foraging, and that measurements of corticosterone from eggs laid after injection found a positive correlation of this hormone with maternal foraging rates.&lt;ref name="BowersBowden2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bowers|first1=E. Keith|last2=Bowden|first2=Rachel M.|last3=Sakaluk|first3=Scott K.|last4=Thompson|first4=Charles F.|title=Immune activation generates corticosterone-mediated terminal reproductive investment in a wild bird|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=185|issue=6|year=2015|pages=769–783|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/681017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In insects===
A study published in 2009 supported the cost of reproduction and terminal investment hypotheses in the [[burying beetle]]. It found that beetles manipulated to overproduce young (by replacing a {{convert|30|g|oz}} [[mouse]] carcass with a {{convert|20|g|oz}} carcass) had shorter lifespans than those that bred on just {{convert|30|g|oz}} carcasses, followed by those that had a {{convert|20|g|oz}} carcass. In turn, non-breeding beetles had a significantly longer lifespan than those that bred. This supports the cost of reproduction hypothesis. Another experiment from the same study found beetles that first bred at 65 days had a larger brood size before dispersal (before the larvae start to pupate in the soil) than those that initially bred at 28 days. This supports the terminal investment hypothesis, and prevents the effect of an increased average brood size in older animals due to differential survival of quality individuals.&lt;ref name="CreightonHeflin2009"/&gt;

===In flatworms===
A study published in 2004 on the [[flatworm]] ''Diplostomum spathaceum''' found that as its intermediate host, a snail, aged, production of cercariae (which are passed on to the final host, a fish) decreased. This is in line with the [[bet hedging (biology)|bet hedging]] hypothesis, which, in this case, says that the flatworm should attempt to keep its host alive longer so that more young can be produced; it does not support the terminal investment hypothesis.&lt;ref name="KarvonenKirsi2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karvonen|first1=A.|last2=Kirsi|first2=S.|last3=Hudson|first3=P. J.|last4=Valtonen|first4=E. T.|title=Patterns of cercarial production from ''Diplostomum spathaceum'': terminal investment or bet hedging?|journal=Parasitology|volume=129|issue=1|year=2004|pages=87–92|issn=0031-1820|doi=10.1017/S0031182004005281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In mammals===
A study published in 2002 found results contrary to the terminal investment hypothesis in [[reindeer]]. Calf weight peaked at the mother's seventh year of age, and declined thereafter. However, this would only be opposed to the hypothesis if reproductive costs did not increase with age. An alternative hypothesis, the senescence hypothesis, positing that reproductive output declines with age-related loss of function, was supported by the study.&lt;ref name="WeladjiMysterud2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weladji|first1=Robert B.|last2=Mysterud|first2=Atle|last3=Holand|first3=Øystein|last4=Lenvik|first4=Dag|title=Age-related reproductive effort in reindeer (''Rangifer tarandus''): evidence of senescence|journal=Oecologia|volume=131|issue=1|year=2002|pages=79–82|issn=0029-8549|doi=10.1007/s00442-001-0864-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive; a study on [[rhesus macaque]]s published in 2010 strongly supported the senescence hypothesis and weakly supported the terminal investment hypothesis. It found that older mothers were lighter, less active, and had lighter infants with reduced survival rates compared to younger mothers (supporting the senescence hypothesis), older individuals spent more time in contact with their young (supporting the senescence hypothesis).&lt;ref name="HoffmanHigham2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hoffman|first1=Christy L.|last2=Higham|first2=James P.|last3=Mas-Rivera|first3=Adaris|last4=Ayala|first4=James E.|last5=Maestripieri|first5=Dario|title=Terminal investment and senescence in rhesus macaques (''Macaca mulatta'') on Cayo Santiago|journal=Behavioral Ecology|volume=21|issue=5|year=2010|pages=972–978|issn=1465-7279|doi=10.1093/beheco/arq098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a study published in 1982 on [[red deer]] on the island of [[Rùm|Rhum]] found that while older mothers produced less offspring (and lighter offspring, when they did) than expected for a given body weight, they had longer suckling bouts (which had previously been correlated with milk yield, calf body condition in early winter, and calf survival to spring) compared to younger mothers.&lt;ref name="Clutton-Brock1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Clutton-Brock|first1=T. H.|title=Reproductive effort and terminal investment in iteroparous animals|journal=The American Naturalist|volume=123|issue=2|year=1984|pages=212–229|issn=0003-0147|doi=10.1086/284198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In reptiles===
A study on [[spotted turtle]]s published in 2008 found that individuals in very poor condition sometimes did not breed. This is consistent with the bet hedging hypothesis, and indicates decision making on a large temporal scale (as spotted turtles may live for 65 to 110 years. However, individuals in poor condition generally produced a relatively large amount of small eggs; consistent with the terminal investment hypothesis.&lt;ref name="LitzgusBolton2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Litzgus|first1=Jacqueline D.|last2=Bolton|first2=Frances|last3=Schulte-Hostedde|first3=Albrecht I.|title=Reproductive output depends on body condition in spotted turtles (''Clemmys guttata'')|journal=Copeia|volume=2008|issue=1|year=2008|pages=86–92|issn=0045-8511|doi=10.1643/CH-07-093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In plants==
Although the terminal investment hypothesis has been relatively widely studied in animals, there have been few studies of the hypothesis' application to plants. One study on members of the long-lived oak genus ''[[Quercus]]'' found that trees declined in condition towards the end of their lifespan, and did not invest an increasing proportion of their decreasing resources in reproduction.&lt;ref name="KoenigKnops2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Walter D.|last2=Knops|first2=Johannes M.

'''The Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture''' (SPWC) was a Toronto [[Not-for-profit arts organization|arts organization]] in existence from 1986 to 1991 that explored environmental and ecological issues from an artistic perspective in a "quirky and innovative" way.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview"&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPWC was best known for three programs: a literary magazine, The Journal of Wild Culture; artist-guided walks, "landscape readings"; and a series of cabarets, The Café of Wild Culture.

The organization was a unique hybrid. The oxymoron "wild culture" tweaked the interest of contrasting types: artists, scientists and activists, and the efforts made by the organization to develop creative projects and discourse around the term were well received.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar"/&gt; It was concurrently accepted as an arts organization by artists and an environmental organization by environmentalists.

The organisation was resurrected in 2011 and is now producing an online magazine based in London and Toronto.

== Art and ecology ==
The style of the organization was determined by how participating artists expressed themselves around the undefined idea of "wild culture" (also see "[[wildculture]]"). While calling for new articulations of wild culture through its projects, at its height the society filled the cultural vacuum in Toronto with an eclectic kind of "thinking man's" fun and provided a forum for experimentation amongst performance artists.&lt;ref name="MetropolisMarch"&gt;''Metropolis'', March 30, 1989, Donna Lypchuk, "Mock on the Wild Side".&lt;/ref&gt; The broader public was encouraged by the SPWC to engage with questions about nature and art, while frequently congregating in the outdoors. This audience was also attracted to the organization's ability to 'soft pedal doom and gloom while partying for the planet".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, "Wild Culture artists party for the planet"., p. D1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a landscape reading on the aboriginal history of downtown Toronto, poet M. T. Kelly offered a view of how the SPWC sought to affect its audience: "There is a bridge between history and landscape. To get people to change their view of the environment, you can't just argue in economic terms. It's an emotional thing. People act politically when they get emotionally involved".&lt;ref name="GlobeMail"&gt;''Globe and Mail'', Sept 7, 1988, June Callwood, 'sunday morning landscape readings cultivate food for thought"., p. A2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of "wild culture" grew out of multidisciplinary artist [[Whitney Smith (multidisciplinary artist)|Whitney Smith]]'s experience of "a spiritual updraft in the art spheres" while foraging wild foods in the Ontario forest that he sold to local chefs. From 1982 to 1985 a series of three performances, "Fern Policy", explored the possibilities of artistic growth in the nature-culture ecotone. In May 1985 Smith made the first public announcement on the formation of the society at a Toronto art event, "L'Affaire 'Pataphysique", that presented examples of [['pataphysics]] by local artists parodying theory and methods of modern science. Following this event Smith began recruiting artists to help develop ''The Journal of Wild Culture''.

== Defining wild culture ==
Though there were attempts by the organization to define "wild culture", there was never an accepted definition. Smith preferred his colleagues and audiences to find wild culture's meaning through the titles of the projects in which it appeared,  where the social context was at play; that is, that there existed a serious-sounding and possibly genuine [[academic journal]] published by a preserving society with a long name, all devoted to a subject no one knew anything about.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar"&gt;''Toronto Star'', April 20, 1990, Vit Wagner, "Wild Culture artists party for the planet"., p. D2.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiating the serious and the non-serious in a way that made sense and entertained became part of the artists' work.

Before there was Smith's recent definition of wild culture ("the articulated [[ecotone]] between what humans do and what they can't control in nature"), no single explanation existed around which the S.P.W.C artists" work was done. Some said that it was the vagueness of the idea, the inability to pin it down, that made it so attractive.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview" /&gt; In the absence of concrete description, Smith offered a metaphor, which he has recently modified: On the surface of a transparent painting&lt;ref name="RyersonReview" /&gt; is the human geographic reality that is part of our everyday life, and in the background are elements of nature, seen and unseen, that are very much alive but that people aren"t always aware of, whether out of convenience, ignorance, apathy, or any state of unconsciousness or self-centeredness that contributes to the disconnection from our primal history and our present psychic hold on the home terrain. Wild culture is the two planes, foreground and background, seen together.&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt;

== Programs ==

=== ''The Journal of Wild Culture'' ===
The literary organ of the SPWC, its subtitle, ecology, and imagination, spoke to the notion of ''[[The Journal of Wild Culture]]'' being a platform for artists to express themselves through the lens, or mirror, of the natural world. Smith said that "one of the things wild culture ''is'', is a tolerance for ambiguity and an acceptance that things cannot be defined".&lt;ref name="NOW Magazine 1987"&gt;''NOW Magazine'', July 9–15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture".&lt;/ref&gt; The "quirky and innovative" magazine carried on its discourse in a way that influenced the way more serious themes could be delivered with a sense of play and timeliness.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview_a"&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Organic start ====
Born out of the wild foods foraging of founder Whitney Smith, the magazine was conceived in 1986-1987 by an editorial team that included Smith and architect [[Peter Ferguson]], public relations consultant [[Kim Obrist]] and filmmaker and publisher [[Christopher Lowry]]. Smith attributed his inspiration for the formation of the society to the [[National Geographic Society]] (which published its own journal) and ''FILE'' magazine, produced by the conceptual and media-based art collective, [[General Idea]], and to the ''[[Utne Reader]]'''s use of other published materials.&lt;ref name="NOW Magazine 1987"/&gt; The SPWC was in production in Toronto from 1986 to 1991. Graphic designer [[Bernard Stockl]] became the art director and quickly established the look of the magazine, including the characteristic contents page. Smith and Lowry assembled a photocopied "Journal of Wild Culture" Preview Issue that was circulated in the arts community, and a donation of $5000 "from an anonymous angel" followed, just enough to pay for the printing of the first issue.&lt;ref name="RyersonReview_a" /&gt;

==== Recruitment through social events ====
The premier issue was launched on July 27, 1987 at the Wild Culture Hoedown on Toronto Island. It was described by Smith at the time as "a cross between a literary journal and an arty comic book with ecology as its theme".&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Sun'', July 24, 1987, Marion Kane, "Get Down at Wild Culture Hoedown"., p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Future Wild Culture events followed the format and spirit of the Hoedown by offering down-home high-end cuisine using wild foods and made on site by Chris Klugman, a well-known local chef, and featuring artists whose personae related to nature themes: the Marquis de Sod and Mr. Potatohead were the guests of honour at the launch. Poet Christopher Dewdney, an early contributor to the magazine, said that "half of the experience at "The Journal of Wild Culture" is the parties.) Volume I, Number 1 was sold for $3.95 and 3000 copies were widely distributed in Canada by Disticor, and the issue sold out; later distribution of increased numbers went into the U.S. It developed a small but devoted fan base, particularly in British Columbia. In 1990 its southwestern U.S. distributor reported that the magazine had "a cult following in Texas".

==== Visual language ====
Smith said that Stockl, who died of AIDS-related causes in 1992, was a significant contributor to JWC. "Bernie's deep sense of graphic taste and design intelligence struck the right tone with the first issue: serious like an academic journal but also accessible and visually engaging. In order for the quirkiness to work we needed the credible and elegant look that his gave us". Stockl said he modeled the JWC design after "Harper's" and "Arts and Architecture": "The trick was to create certain effects with what was available to us. Trying to cheat our way through it without it looking like that". The Bernard Franklin Stockl Memorial Scholarship is offered annually at the Alberta College of Design for "creative and innovative exploration in the use of typography for the purpose of communication".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acad.ab.ca/award_descriptions_winter.html |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310055407/http://www.acad.ab.ca/award_descriptions_winter.html |archivedate=March 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Difficulties and demise ====
In the late 1980s, when advertisers were slow to embrace the few existing green magazines, and particularly one which the ''Utne Reader'' editor, [[Eric Utne]], called "indescribable", low ad sales made it difficult to pay the bills and meet that quarterly schedule; only seven issues were published. Two Wild Culture auctions and funding from the federal and provincials arts councils helped take up the slack, but with a low subscription base and advertising revenue, a sudden drop in grant revenue, fund-raising and marketing fatigue, Smith's reluctance to step into the role of "a career publisher",&lt;ref&gt;''Ryerson Review of Journalism'', April 1991, Megan Park, "Call of the Wild", p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine decided to take a sabbatical. More recently Smith commented on his own burn-out keeping the magazine and the SPWC going, the dilemma of the artist-publisher, and the difficulty of keeping cultural magazines afloat in factors relating to demise of JWC. In early 1991, on CBC radio's "Arts Report", it was announced that the magazine was suspending publication. The plan was to pursue a more economically feasible course by following the format of ''[[Granta]]'' magazine, offering it as a trade paperback available in bookstores. A pilot issue of selections from past JWC issues was put out by Somerville House in 1992, ''Wild Culture'', edited by Smith and Lowry, but sales were not encouraging; one explanation for this was that the book did not offer new material.

An attempt by Smith and some new colleagues in 2002 to resurrect the ''Journal of Wild Culture'' online never got off the ground. Smith said that wild culture was "a notion with a mind of its own" and that "the ingredients for a re-launch in 2002 just weren't there".

=== Landscape Readings ===
Landscape Readings were public walking tours led by artists of outdoor environments that held an intellectual or personal interest for the artist. Landscape Readings were a hybrid that combined the attraction of authors reading their own works with a bracing picnic outing in a setting which combines the context for a lecture on ecology, geology, history or biography.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt;

The readings were a project initially conceived by Smith to provide a venue for writer and poet Christopher Dewdney to share his extensive knowledge of palaeozoic geology, among other things, and his sense of humour. In July 1987 he gave the first landscape reading of Toronto's High Park Carolinian forest,&lt;ref&gt;''NOW Magazine'', July 9–15, 1987, Ted Mumford, 'society mines wild culture," p. ?.&lt;/ref&gt; which was documented in the forthcoming issue of ''The Journal of Wild Culture''.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Dewdney, photos by David Hlynsky, Fall 1987, "Evidence Revealed During Walk in Park", ''The Journal of Wild Culture'', Vol. I, No. 3., p. 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artist guides included [[Gordon Rayner]], [[Hank Hedges]], [[M. T. Kelly]], [[June Callwood]], [[Larry Zolf]], [[Joyce Weiland]], and architect [[Donald Schmitt]]. The Readings were created to "give [SPWC participating] artists a new venue".&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt;

=== The Café of Wild Culture ===
The Café of Wild Culture was conceived in collaboration with bookseller and film programmer [[Marc Glassman]], who recognized that the sense of humour that was so much a part of the 60s and 70s was missing in the 80s.&lt;ref&gt;''Toronto Star'', February 4, 1989, Ingrid Hamilton, "Scene and Heard", p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Café was performed first in Toronto at [[The Rivoli]], and later in New York at the Village Gate and at Goddard College in Vermont. Its legitimate non-theatre style &lt;ref name="MetropolisMarch" /&gt; played off the vaudeville and variety revue made up of several short unrelated acts (in the Café's case, no longer than 7 minutes) that caught the wild culture spirit of thoughtful irreverence. Acts ranged from tendentious 'pataphysical lectures, authentic scientific explanations, obtuse dance works, gentlemen's shirt-ironing contests, and wild food cooking demonstrations, in which small servings were provided for the audience, and a game called StorySlide where artists improvised a performed text based on a random photographic slide show.

=== Other programs ===
Smith met his match when he began a project called the Great Festival of the Lakes,&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt; which was to encourage the presentation of community arts festivals in Great Lakes cities.&lt;ref name="GlobeMail" /&gt; "I was very concerned about water quality issues at the time, and thought that the SPWC needed an activist project to sponsor. I was wrong. Organizing anything around the Great Lakes is like trying to organize Europe. I learned a lot about underestimating scale on that one, and spreading myself too thin". The project was abandoned after a couple of years.

In 1990, the SPWC worked with an organization started by Michael Stadtlander and Jamie Kennedy, Knives and Forks, on Spring Feast,&lt;ref name="TorontoStar" /&gt; which became a precursor of future events promoting local chefs and wild and organic foods.

== The Journal of Wild Culture 2.0 ==
From September 2011 Smith's work on the SPWC focused on the online publishing platform, The Journal of Wild Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Whitney|title=Wild Culture info|url=http://www.whitneysmith.ca/wildcultureinfo.htm|work=Information page|publisher=Whitney Smith|accessdate=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was beta-launched in December 2012 in London as www.wildculture.com by an editorial and design team including Smith, Joe Hedges of Branding by Garden, Tom Jeffreys, Sarah Lester, Rosie Jackson and Liam Desroy, continued with Smith, Jeffreys and designer Hedges from February to October 2013, at which time Smith took over sole editorial responsibilities, in collaboration, until 2016, with board members Lisa Wilson and Richard Stursberg; Stursberg continues to participate in an advisory role. The publication has no advertising, sends out a weekly newsletter, is supported by donations and the work of a growing community of international contributors. Current editors and contributing editors under publisher/editor Smith include Chellis Glendinning, Herbert Wright, Chris Lowry, Henry Giroux and illustrator Brad Harley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wild Culture, people page|url=http://www.wildculture.com/people|website=The Journal of Wild Culture|publisher=Society for the Preservation of Wild Culture|accessdate=January 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mammal]]s, the '''vagina''' is the elastic, muscular part of the [[female genital tract]]. In humans, it extends from the [[vulva]] to the [[cervix]]. The outer vaginal opening is normally partly covered by a membrane called the [[hymen]]. At the deep end, the cervix (neck of the [[uterus]]) bulges into the vagina. The vagina allows for [[sexual intercourse]] and [[birth]].&lt;!-- NOTE: "Birth" instead of "childbirth." The article is not solely about humans. "Childbirth" is mentioned lower.--&gt;  It also channels [[Menstruation|menstrual flow]] (menses), which occurs in humans and closely related [[primate]]s as part of the monthly [[menstrual cycle]].
 
Although research on the vagina is especially lacking for different animals, its location, structure and size is documented as varying among species. Female mammals usually have two external openings in the vulva, the [[urethral]] opening for the [[urinary tract]] and the vaginal opening for the genital tract. This is different from male mammals, who usually have a single [[Urinary meatus|urethral opening]] for both [[urination]] and [[reproduction]]. The vaginal opening is much larger than the nearby urethral opening, and both are protected by the [[labia]] in humans. In [[amphibian]]s, [[bird]]s, [[reptile]]s and [[monotreme]]s, the [[cloaca]] is the single external opening for the gastrointestinal tract, the urinary, and reproductive tracts.

To accommodate smoother penetration of the vagina during sexual intercourse or other [[sexual activity]], vaginal moisture increases during [[sexual arousal]] in human females and other female mammals. This increase in moisture provides [[vaginal lubrication]], which reduces friction. The texture of the vaginal walls creates friction for the [[penis]] during sexual intercourse and stimulates it toward [[ejaculation]], enabling [[fertilization]]. Along with pleasure and bonding, women's sexual behavior with others (which can include [[heterosexual]] or [[lesbian]] sexual activity) can result in [[Sexually transmitted disease|sexually transmitted infections]] (STIs), the risk of which can be reduced by recommended [[safe sex]] practices. [[#Infections, diseases, and safe sex|Other health issues]] may also affect the human vagina.

The vagina and [[vulva]] have evoked strong reactions in societies throughout history, including negative perceptions and language, cultural [[taboo]]s, and their use as symbols for [[female sexuality]], spirituality, or regeneration of life. [[Colloquialism|In common speech]], the word ''vagina'' is often used to refer to the vulva or to the female genitals in general. By its dictionary and anatomical definitions, however, ''vagina'' refers exclusively to the specific internal structure, and understanding the distinction can improve knowledge of the female genitalia and aid in healthcare communication.

==Etymology and definition==

The term ''vagina'' is from [[Latin]] meaning "sheath" or "[[scabbard]]"; the plural of ''vagina'' is either ''vaginae'', or ''vaginas''.&lt;ref name="Stevenson"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Stevenson A|title=Oxford Dictionary of English|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0199571123|year=2010|page=1962 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vagina may also be referred to as "the birth canal" in the context of [[pregnancy]] and [[childbirth]].&lt;ref name="Nevid"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Nevid J, Rathus S, Rubenstein H |title=Health in the New Millennium: The Smart Electronic Edition (S.E.E.)|publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]]|isbn=978-1572591714|year=1998|page=297 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H65N8vmbgTYC&amp;pg=PA297}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lipsky"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Lipsky MS|title=American Medical Association Concise Medical Encyclopedia|publisher=[[Random House Reference]]|isbn=978-0375721809|year=2006|page=96 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DtZ_XdSymSIC&amp;pg=PA96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although by its dictionary and anatomical definitions, the term ''vagina'' refers exclusively to the specific internal structure, it is [[Colloquialism|colloquially]] used to refer to the [[vulva]] or to both the vagina and vulva.&lt;ref name="Dalton"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Dalton M|title=Forensic Gynaecology|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-1107064294|year=2014|page=65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kr6ZBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Jones T, Wear D, Friedman LD |title=Health Humanities Reader|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|isbn=978-0813573670|year=2014|pages=231–232 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqRvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the term ''vagina'' to mean "vulva" can pose medical or legal confusion; for example, a person's interpretation of its location might not match another's interpretation of the location.&lt;ref name="Dalton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Kirkpatrick M|title=Human Sexuality: Personality and Social Psychological Perspectives|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|isbn=978-1468436563|year=2012|page=175 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qfsxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medically, the vagina is the canal between the [[hymen]] (or remnants of the hymen) and the [[cervix]], while, legally, it begins at the vulva (between the [[labia]]).&lt;ref name="Dalton"/&gt; It may be that the incorrect use of the term ''vagina'' is due to not as much thought going into the anatomy of the female genitals as has gone into the study of male genitals, and that this has contributed to an absence of correct vocabulary for the external female genitalia among both the general public and health professionals. Because of this and because a better understanding of female genitalia can help combat sexual and psychological harm with regard to female development, researchers endorse correct terminology for the vulva.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Hill CA|title=Human Sexuality: Personality and Social Psychological Perspectives|publisher=[[Sage Publications]]|isbn=978-1506320120|year=2007|pages=265–266 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUJsCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266|quote=Little thought apparently has been devoted to the nature of female genitals in general, likely accounting for the reason that most people use incorrect terms when referring to female external genitals. The term typically used to talk about female genitals is ''vagina'', which is actually an internal sexual structure, the muscular passageway leading outside from the uterus. The correct term for the female external genitals is ''vulva'', as discussed in chapter 6, which includes the clitoris, labia majora, and labia minora.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sáenz-Herrero"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Sáenz-Herrero M|title=Psychopathology in Women: Incorporating Gender Perspective into Descriptive Psychopathology|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]]|isbn=978-3319058702|year=2014|page=250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-unSBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250|quote=In addition, there is a current lack of appropriate vocabulary to refer to the external female genitals, using, for example, 'vagina' and 'vulva' as if they were synonyms, as if using these terms incorrectly were harmless to the sexual and psychological development of women.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When not [[sexually aroused]], the vagina is a collapsed tube, with the front and back walls placed together. The lateral walls, especially their middle area, are relatively more rigid.

====Vaginal opening and hymen====
The vaginal opening is at the posterior end of the [[vulval vestibule]], behind the [[urinary meatus|urethral opening]]. The opening to the vagina is normally obscured by the [[labia minora]] (vaginal lips), but may be exposed after [[vaginal delivery]].&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt;

The [[hymen]] is a [[membrane]] of tissue that surrounds or partially covers the vaginal opening.&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt; The effects of [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] and childbirth on the hymen are variable. Where it is broken, it may completely disappear or remnants known as ''carunculae myrtiformes'' may persist. Otherwise, being very elastic, it may return to its normal position.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Knight B |title=Simpson's Forensic Medicine|edition=11th|year=1997|publisher=Arnold|location=London|page=114|isbn=978-0-7131-4452-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the hymen may be lacerated by disease, injury, [[medical examination]], [[masturbation]] or [[physical exercise]]. For these reasons, [[virginity]] cannot be definitively determined by examining the hymen.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Perlman"&gt;{{Cite book|vauthors=Perlman SE, Nakajyma ST, Hertweck SP |title=Clinical protocols in pediatric and adolescent gynecology|year=2004|publisher=Parthenon |page=131 |isbn=978-1-84214-199-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Variations and size====
{{Main|Human vaginal size}}
The length of the vagina [[anatomical variation|varies]] among women of child-bearing age. Because of the presence of the cervix in the front wall of the vagina, there is a difference in length between the front wall, approximately 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm (2.5 to 3 in) long, and the back wall, approximately 9&amp;nbsp;cm (3.5&amp;nbsp;in) long.&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wylie"/&gt;  During sexual arousal, the vagina expands both in length and width. If a woman stands upright, the vaginal canal points in an upward-backward direction and forms an angle of approximately 45 degrees with the uterus.&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsevier Obstetrics"/&gt; The vaginal opening and hymen also vary in size; in children, although the hymen commonly appears [[crescent]]-shaped, many shapes are possible.&lt;ref name="Dutta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Emans"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Emans SJ |chapter=Physical Examination of the Child and Adolescent |title=Evaluation of the Sexually Abused Child: A Medical Textbook and Photographic Atlas |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|pages=61–65|isbn=978-0199747825|date=2000|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3eQZhs4PwrYC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
{{Further|Development of the reproductive system}}
[[File:Sobo 1906 508.png|right|thumb|alt=Drawn anatomic illustration as described in caption|An illustration showing a cut-away portion of the vagina and upper female genital tract (only one ovary and fallopian tube shown). Circular folds (also called rugae) of vaginal mucosa can be seen.]]
The vaginal plate is the precursor to the vagina.&lt;ref name="Edmonds" /&gt; During development, the vaginal plate begins to grow where the fused ends of the [[paramesonephric duct]]s (Müllerian ducts) enter the back wall of the [[urogenital sinus]] as the [[sinus tubercle]]. As the plate grows, it significantly separates the cervix and the urogenital sinus; eventually, the central cells of the plate break down to form the vaginal [[Lumen (anatomy)|lumen]].&lt;ref name="Edmonds"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Edmonds K |title=Dewhurst's Textbook of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=978-0470654576|year=2012|page=423 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HfakBRceodcC&amp;pg=PA423}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usually occurs by the twenty to twenty-fourth week of development. If the lumen does not form, or is incomplete, membranes known as [[vaginal septum|vaginal septae]] can form across or around the tract, causing obstruction of the outflow tract later in life.&lt;ref name="Edmonds"/&gt;

During [[sexual differentiation in humans|sexual differentiation]], without [[testosterone]], the urogenital sinus persists as [[Vulval vestibule|the vestibule]] of the vagina. The two [[Development of the reproductive system#External genitalia|urogenital folds]]  of the [[genital tubercle]] form the [[labia minora]], and the [[labioscrotal swelling]]s enlarge to form the [[labia majora]].&lt;ref name="Merz and Bahlmann"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Merz E, Bahlmann F |title=Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=1 |publisher=[[Thieme Medical Publishers]] |year=2004|page=129|isbn=978-1-58890-147-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schuenke"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Schuenke M, Schulte E, Schumacher U |title=General Anatomy and Musculoskeletal System |publisher=[[Thieme Medical Publishers]] |isbn=978-1-60406-287-8|year=2010|page=192 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NK9TgTaGt6UC&amp;pg=PA192}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are conflicting views on the embryologic origin of the vagina. The majority view is Koff's 1933 description, which posits that the upper two-thirds of the vagina originate from the caudal part of the Müllerian duct, while the lower part of the vagina develops from the urogenital sinus.&lt;ref name="Herrington"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Herrington CS|title=Pathology of the Cervix|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|isbn=978-3319512570|year=2017|pages=2–3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hc40DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodruff"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Woodruff TJ, Janssen SJ, Guillette LJ, Jr, Giudice LC|title=Environmental Impacts on Reproductive Health and Fertility|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-1139484848|year=2010|page=33|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQRAfsjuUgQC&amp;pg=PA33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other views are Bulmer's 1957's description that the vaginal epithelium derives solely from the urogenital sinus epithelium,&lt;ref name="New insights"/&gt; and Witschi's 1970 research, which reexamined Koff's description and concluded that the [[sinovaginal bulb]]s are the same as the lower portions of the [[Wolffian duct]]s.&lt;ref name="Woodruff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigoris"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Grimbizis GF, Campo R, Tarlatzis BC, Gordts S|title=Female Genital Tract Congenital Malformations: Classification, Diagnosis and Management|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|isbn=978-1447151463|year=2015|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGlnBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Witschi's view is supported by research by Acién et al., Bok and Drews.&lt;ref name="Woodruff"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Grigoris"/&gt; Robboy et al. reviewed Koff and Bulmer's theories, and support Bulmer's description in light of their own research.&lt;ref name="New insights"/&gt; The debates stem from the complexity of the interrelated tissues and the absence of an animal model that matches human vaginal development.&lt;ref name="New insights"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robboy S, Kurita T, Baskin L, Cunha GR |year=2017 |title=New insights into human female reproductive tract development |pmid=28918284|pmc=5712241 |journal=Differentiation |volume= 97|pages=9–22|doi=10.1016/j.diff.2017.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurman"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Kurman RJ|title=Blaustein's Pathology of the Female Genital Tract|publisher=[[Springer Science &amp; Business Media]]|isbn=978-1475738896|year=2013|page=132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sM3eBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, study of human vaginal development is ongoing and may help resolve the conflicting data.&lt;ref name="Woodruff"/&gt;

===Microanatomy===
{{Main|Vaginal epithelium}}
[[File:Vagina (mucosa).JPG|thumb|alt=Micrograph of vaginal wall|Medium-power magnification [[micrograph]] of a [[H&amp;E stain]]ed slide showing a portion of a vaginal wall. [[Stratified squamous epithelium]] and underling connective tissue can be seen. The deeper muscular layers are not shown. The black line points to a fold in the mucosa.]]
The vaginal wall from the lumen outwards consists firstly of a [[mucosa]] of [[stratified squamous epithelium]] that is not [[Stratified squamous epithelium#Keratinized|keratinized]], with a [[lamina propria]] (a thin layer of [[connective tissue]]) underneath it. Secondly, there is a layer of [[smooth muscle]] with bundles of circular fibers internal to longitudinal fibers (those that run lengthwise). Lastly, is an outer layer of connective tissue called the [[adventitia]]. Some texts list four layers by counting the two sublayers of the mucosa (epithelium and lamina propria) separately.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Brown L |title=Pathology of the Vulva and Vagina |year=2012|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|isbn=978-0857297570|pages=6–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yv2CMHoVR9wC&amp;pg=PA6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Arulkumaran"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Arulkumaran S, Regan L, Papageorghiou A, Monga A, Farquharson D |title=Oxford Desk Reference: Obstetrics and Gynaecology |year=2011|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0191620874|page=471|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRaWcRYx_7YC&amp;pg=PA471}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The smooth [[muscular layer]] within the vagina has a weak contractive force that can create some pressure in the lumen of the vagina; much stronger contractive force, such as during childbirth, comes from muscles in the [[pelvic floor]] that are attached to the adventitia around the vagina.&lt;ref name=Bitzer&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Bitzer J, Lipshultz L, Pastuszak A, Goldstein A, Giraldi A, Perelman M |title=Management of Sexual Dysfunction in Men and Women |date=2016 |publisher=Springer New York |isbn=9781493930999 |page=202 |language=en |chapter=The Female Sexual Response: Anatomy and Physiology of Sexual Desire, Arousal, and Orgasm in Women|doi=10.1007/978-1-4939-3100-2_18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lamina propria is rich in blood vessels and lymphatic channels. The muscular layer is composed of smooth muscle fibers, with an outer layer of longitudinal muscle, an inner layer of circular muscle, and oblique muscle fibers between. The outer layer, the adventitia, is a thin dense layer of connective tissue and it blends with loose connective tissue containing blood vessels, [[lymphatic vessel]]s and nerve fibers that are between pelvic organs.&lt;ref name="Mulhall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Arulkumaran" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Wylie"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Wylie L |title=Essential Anatomy and Physiology in Maternity Care |year=2005|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=978-0-443-10041-3|pages=157–158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QgpOvSDxGGYC&amp;pg=PA157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaginal mucosa is absent of glands.

Two main veins drain blood from the vagina, one on the left and one on the right. These form a network of smaller veins, the [[vaginal venous plexus]], on the sides of the vagina, connecting with similar venous plexuses of the [[uterine venous plexus|uterus]], [[vesical venous plexus|bladder]], and [[rectal venous plexus|rectum]]. These ultimately drain into the [[internal iliac vein]]s.&lt;ref name=GRAYS2008 /&gt;

This begins after ten to thirty seconds of sexual arousal, and increases in amount the longer the woman is aroused.&lt;ref name="Heffner"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Heffner LJ, Schust DJ |title=The Reproductive System at a Glance|page=39|isbn=978-1118607015|date=2014|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JuvcAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reduces friction or injury that can be caused by insertion of the penis into the vagina or other penetration of the vagina during sexual activity.

An area in the vagina that may be an [[erogenous zone]] is the [[G-spot]]. It is typically defined as being located at the anterior wall of the vagina, a couple or few inches in from the entrance, and some women experience intense pleasure, and sometimes an orgasm, if this area is stimulated during sexual activity.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bullough"/&gt; A G-spot orgasm may be responsible for [[female ejaculation]], leading some doctors and researchers to believe that G-spot pleasure comes from the [[Skene's gland]]s, a female [[Homology (biology)|homologue]] of the [[prostate]], rather than any particular spot on the vaginal wall; other researchers consider the connection between the Skene's glands and the G-spot area to be weak.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hines"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bullough"/&gt; The G-spot's existence (and existence as a distinct structure) is still under dispute because reports of its location can vary from woman to woman, it appears to be nonexistent in some women, and it is hypothesized to be an extension of the clitoris and therefore the reason for orgasms experienced vaginally.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balon, Segraves"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilchevsky"/&gt;

=== Childbirth ===
{{Main|Childbirth}}
The vagina is the birth canal for the [[childbirth|delivery]] of a baby. When labor (a physiological process preceding delivery) nears, several signs may occur, including vaginal discharge, and the [[rupture of membranes]] (water breaking) that can result in a gush of [[amniotic fluid]]&lt;ref name="Orshan"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Orshan SA |title=Maternity, Newborn, and Women's Health Nursing: Comprehensive Care Across the Lifespan|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|isbn=978-0781742542|year=2008|pages=585–586 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=91dAzl2J_LgC&amp;pg=PA585}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an irregular or small stream of fluid from the vagina.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Evans JM, Aronson R |title=The Whole Pregnancy Handbook: An Obstetrician's Guide to Integrating Conventional and Alternative Medicine Before, During, and After Pregnancy|publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]]|isbn=978-1592401116|year=2005|pages=435–436 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qj3VmuHvsOgC&amp;pg=PA435}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Norsigian"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=((Boston Women's Health Book Collective)) |title=Our Bodies, Ourselves: Pregnancy and Birth|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=978-1416565918|year=2008|pages=172–174 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzHZlM9fha4C&amp;pg=PA172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water breaking most commonly happens during labor; however, it can occur before labor (known as premature rupture of membranes) and this happens in 10% of cases.&lt;ref name="Evans" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Callahan"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Callahan T, Caughey AB|title=Blueprints Obstetrics and Gynecology|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|isbn=978-1451117028|year=2013|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eKC1B3BhlxUC&amp;pg=PA40}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Braxton Hicks contractions]] are also a sign of nearing labor, but not all women notice them.&lt;ref name="Orshan" /&gt; Among women giving birth for the first time, Braxton Hicks contractions are mistaken for actual [[Uterine contraction#Childbirth|contractions]], and are usually very strong in the days leading up to labor.&lt;ref name="Pillitteri"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Pillitteri A|title=Maternal and Child Health Nursing: Care of the Childbearing and Childrearing Family|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|isbn=978-1469833224|year=2013|page=298|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=26idAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the body prepares for childbirth, the cervix softens, [[Cervical effacement|thins]], moves forward to face the front, and begins to open. This allows the fetus to settle or "drop" into the pelvis.&lt;ref name="Orshan"/&gt; As the fetus settles into the pelvis, pain from the [[sciatic nerve]]s, increased vaginal discharge, and increased urinary frequency can occur. While these symptoms are likelier to happen after labor has begun for women who have given birth before, they may happen ten to fourteen days before labor in women experiencing labor for the first time.&lt;ref name="Orshan"/&gt;

The fetus begins to lose the support of the cervix when contractions begin. With [[cervical dilation]] reaching a diameter of more than {{convert|10|cm|in|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} to accommodate the head of the fetus, the head moves from the uterus to the vagina.&lt;ref name="Orshan"/&gt; The elasticity of the vagina allows it to stretch to many times its normal diameter in order to deliver the child.&lt;ref name="Wylie" /&gt;

Vaginal births are more common, but if there is a risk of complications a [[caesarean section]] (C-section) may be performed.&lt;ref name=NIH&gt;{{cite web|title=Pregnancy Labor and Birth|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/labor-and-birth|publisher=Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|access-date=July 15, 2017|date=February 1, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728021055/https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/labor-and-birth|archive-date=July 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vaginal mucosa has an abnormal accumulation of fluid ([[edematous]]) and is thin, with few rugae, a little after birth. The mucosa thickens and rugae return in approximately three weeks once the ovaries regain usual function and estrogen flow is restored. The vaginal opening gapes and is relaxed, until it returns to its approximate pre-pregnant state six to eight weeks after delivery, known as the [[postpartum period]]; however, the vagina will continue to be larger in size than it was previously.&lt;ref name="Ricci"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ricci SS, Kyle T |title=Maternity and Pediatric Nursing|publisher=[[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]]|isbn=978-0781780551|year=2009|pages=431–432 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gaYtFuND7VIC&amp;pg=PA431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After giving birth, there is a phase of vaginal discharge called [[lochia]] that can vary significantly in the amount of loss and its duration but can go on for up to six weeks.&lt;ref name="Fletcher"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Fletcher, S, Grotegut, CA, James, AH |title=Lochia patterns among normal women: a systematic review.|journal=Journal of Women's Health (2002) |date=December 2012 |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=1290–4 |doi=10.1089/jwh.2012.3668 |pmid=23101487}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vaginal microbiota ===
{{Main|Vaginal flora}}
{{further|List of microbiota species of the lower reproductive tract of women}}
The [[vaginal flora]] is a complex [[ecosystem]] that changes throughout life, from birth to menopause. The vaginal microbiota resides in and on the outermost layer of the vaginal epithelium.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; This microbiome consists of species and genera which typically do not cause symptoms or infections in women with normal immunity.

The vagina is assessed internally by the examiner with gloved fingers, before the speculum is inserted, to note the presence of any weakness, lumps or [[Nodule (medicine)|nodules]]. Inflammation and discharge are noted if present. During this time, the Skene's and Bartolin's glands are palpated to identify abnormalities in these structures.

===Medications===
[[Intravaginal administration]] is a [[route of administration]] where the medication is inserted into the vagina as a creme or tablet.

Before the baby merges from the womb, an injection for pain control during childbirth may be administered through the vaginal wall and near the [[pudendal nerve]].

The vaginal lymph nodes often trap [[cancer]]ous cells that originate in the vagina. These nodes can be assessed for the presence of disease. Selective surgical removal (rather than total and more invasive removal) of vaginal lymph nodes reduces the risk of complications that can accompany more radical surgeries.

During the third stage of labor, while the infant is being born, the vagina undergoes significant changes. A gush of blood from the vagina may be seen right before the baby is born.

===Surgery===
The vagina, including the vaginal opening, may be altered as a result of surgeries such as an episiotomy, [[vaginectomy]], [[vaginoplasty]] or [[labiaplasty]].&lt;ref name="Siemionow"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tabers&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Venes D|title=Taber's Cyclopedic Medical Dictionary|publisher=F.A.

Any scarring from the procedure is minimal, and long-term problems have not been identified.&lt;ref name="Siemionow"/&gt;

During an episiotomy, a surgical incision is made during the second stage of labor to enlarge the vaginal opening for the baby to pass through.&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Although its routine use is no longer recommended,&lt;ref name=ACOG165&gt;{{cite journal|title=Practice Bulletin No. 165: Prevention and Management of Obstetric Lacerations at Vaginal Delivery.|journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology|date=July 2016|volume=128|issue=1|pages=e1–e15|pmid=27333357|doi=10.1097/AOG.0000000000001523|author1=American College of Obstetricians Gynecologists' Committee on Practice Bulletins—Obstetrics}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not having an episiotomy is found to have better results than an episiotomy,&lt;ref name="Anderson" /&gt; it is one of the most common medical procedures performed on women.

Vaginectomy is surgery to remove all or part of the vagina, and is usually used to treat malignancy.&lt;ref name=Tabers/&gt; Removal of some or all of the reproductive organs and genitalia can result in damage to the nerves and leave behind scarring or [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]].&lt;ref name="Holland"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psycho-oncology |vauthors=Holland JC, Breitbart WD, Jacobsen PB |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2015|isbn=978-0199363315|page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oy9mBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual function may also be impaired as a result, as in the case of some cervical cancer surgeries. These surgeries can impact pain, elasticity, vaginal lubrication and sexual arousal. This often resolves after one year but may take longer.&lt;ref name="Holland"/&gt;

Women, especially those who are older and have had multiple births, may choose to surgically correct vaginal laxity.

Women who undergo this procedure may unknowingly have a medical issue, such as a prolapse, and an attempt to correct this is also made during the surgery.&lt;ref name="Cardozo"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bb7ZDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2962|title=Textbook of Female Urology and Urogynecology, Fourth Edition - Two-Volume Set|vauthors=Cardozo L, Staskin D|publisher=[[CRC Press]]|year=2017|isbn=978-1498796613|pages=2962–2976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surgery on the vagina can be elective or cosmetic. Women who seek cosmetic surgery can have [[congenital]] conditions, physical discomfort or wish to alter the appearance of their genitals. Concerns over average genital appearance or measurements are largely unavailable and make defining a successful outcome for such surgery difficult.&lt;ref name="Lloyd"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lloyd J, Crouch NS, Minto CL, Liao LM, Creighton SM |date=May 2005 |title=Female genital appearance: 'normality' unfolds |journal=British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology |volume=112 |issue=5 |pages=643–646 |doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2004.00517.x |doi-access=free |pmid=15842291}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of [[sex reassignment surgery|sex reassignment surgeries]] are available to [[transgender]] people.

[[David Buss]], an [[evolutionary psychologist]], stated that because a penis is significantly larger than a clitoris and is readily visible while the vagina is not, and males urinate through the penis, boys are taught from childhood to touch their penises while girls are often taught that they should not touch their own genitalia, which implies that there is harm in doing so.

While, in ancient times, the vagina was often considered equivalent ([[Homology (biology)|homologous]]) to the penis, with anatomists [[Galen]] (129 AD&amp;nbsp;– 200 AD) and [[Andreas Vesalius|Vesalius]] (1514–1564) regarding the organs as structurally the same except for the vagina being inverted, anatomical studies over latter centuries showed the clitoris to be the penile equivalent.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Angier"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=[[Natalie Angier|Angier N]] |title=Woman: An Intimate Geography |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|page=92|isbn=978-0-395-69130-4 |year=1999 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NIonAf-m9OwC&amp;pg=PA92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another perception of the vagina was that the release of vaginal fluids would cure or remedy a number of ailments; various methods were used over the centuries to release "female seed" (via vaginal lubrication or female ejaculation) as a treatment for {{lang|la|suffocatio ex semine retento}} (suffocation of the womb, {{literal translation|lk=on}}&amp;nbsp;'suffocation from retained seed'), [[green sickness]], and possibly for [[female hysteria]]. Reported methods for treatment included a [[midwife]] rubbing the walls of the vagina or insertion of the penis or penis-shaped objects into the vagina. Symptoms of the female hysteria diagnosis&amp;nbsp;– a concept that is no longer recognized by medical authorities as a medical disorder&amp;nbsp;– included faintness, nervousness, insomnia, fluid retention, heaviness in abdomen, muscle spasm, shortness of breath, irritability, loss of appetite for food or sex, and a propensity for causing trouble.&lt;ref name=Maines&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Maines RP |title=The Technology of Orgasm: "Hysteria", the Vibrator, and Women's Sexual Satisfaction |publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=1998|pages=1–188|isbn=978-0-8018-6646-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iNKw0XuaSxoC}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that women who were considered suffering from female hysteria condition would sometimes undergo "pelvic massage"&amp;nbsp;– stimulation of the genitals by the doctor until the woman experienced "hysterical paroxysm" (i.e., orgasm).

''[[The Vagina Monologues]]'', a 1996 episodic play by [[Eve Ensler]], has contributed to making female sexuality a topic of public discourse. It is made up of a varying number of monologues read by a number of women. Initially, Ensler performed every monologue herself, with subsequent performances featuring three actresses; latter versions feature a different actress for every role. Each of the monologues deals with an aspect of the [[Femininity|feminine experience]], touching on matters such as sexual activity, love, rape, menstruation, female genital mutilation, masturbation, birth, orgasm, the various common names for the vagina, or simply as a physical aspect of the body. A recurring theme throughout the pieces is the vagina as a tool of female empowerment, and the ultimate embodiment of individuality.&lt;ref name="Ensler"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=[[Eve Ensler|Ensler E]] |title=The Vagina Monologues: The V-Day Edition |publisher=[[Random House|Random House LLC]] |isbn=978-0375506581|year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=G74c4i2SUmAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coleman"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Coleman C |title=Coming to Read "The Vagina Monologues": A Biomythographical Unravelling of the Narrative |publisher=[[University of New Brunswick]] |isbn=978-0494466551|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Custom and tradition are the most frequently cited reasons for the practice of female genital mutilation. Some cultures believe that female genital mutilation is part of a girl's initiation into adulthood and that not performing it can disrupt social and political cohesion.&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Momoh"/&gt; In these societies, a girl is often not considered an adult unless she has undergone the procedure.&lt;ref name="WHO, FGM"/&gt;

The vagina is a structure of animals in which the female is [[internal fertilization|internally fertilized]], rather than by [[traumatic insemination]] used by some invertebrates. The shape of the vagina varies among different animals. In [[Placentalia|placental mammals]] and [[Marsupial reproductive system|marsupials]], the vagina leads from the [[uterus]] to the exterior of the female body. Female marsupials [[Marsupial female reproductive system|have two lateral vaginas]], which lead to separate uteri, but both open externally through the same orifice; a third canal, which is known as the median vagina, and can be transitory or permanent, is used for birth.&lt;ref name="Tyndale-BiscoeRenfree1987"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hugh Tyndale-Biscoe|author2=Marilyn Renfree|title=Reproductive Physiology of Marsupials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HpjovN0vXW4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=vagina&amp;f=false|date=30 January 1987|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-33792-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female [[spotted hyena]] does not have an external vaginal opening.

'''''The Coming Race''''' is a novel by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], published anonymously in 1871. It has also been published as '''''Vril, the Power of the Coming Race'''''.
 
Some readers have believed the account of a superior subterranean [[master race]] and the energy-form called "Vril", at least in part; some [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]], notably [[Helena Blavatsky]], [[William Scott-Elliot]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]], accepted the book as based on occult truth, in part.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 55–123.&lt;/ref&gt; One 1960 book, ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', suggested that a [[Secret society|secret]] '''Vril Society''' existed in [[Weimar_Republic|Weimar]] [[Berlin]]. However, there is no evidence for the existence of such a society.

==History==
The original, British edition of ''The Coming Race'' was published anonymously in May 1871, by Blackwood and Sons of Edinburgh and London.&lt;ref name=newsUK/&gt; (Blackwood published four more "editions" in 1871.)&lt;ref name="editions"/&gt; Anonymous American and Canadian editions were published in August, as ''The Coming Race, or The New Utopia'', by Francis B. Felt &amp; Co. in New York and by Copp, Clark &amp; Co. in Toronto.&lt;ref name=newsUS/&gt;&lt;ref name=newsCA/&gt; &lt;br&gt;
Late in 1871 Bulwer-Lytton was known to be the author.{{cn|date=December 2017}} [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]]'s ''[[Erewhon]]'' was also published anonymously, in March 1872, and Butler suspected that its initial success was due to being taken as a ''Coming Race'' sequel by Bulwer-Lytton. It was revealed that Butler was the writer in the 25 May 1872 issue of the ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]''; as Butler was unknown at the time, sales dropped by 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Redfield | first = Marc | title = Phantom Formations: Aesthetic Ideology and the Bildungsroman | publisher = Cornell University Press | date = 1996 | page = 170 | isbn = 0-8014-3236-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==

The novel centres on a young, independent, unnamed, wealthy traveller (the narrator), who visits a friend,  a mining engineer. They explore a natural chasm in a mine which has been exposed by an exploratory shaft. The narrator reaches the bottom of the chasm safely, but the rope breaks and his friend is killed. The narrator finds his way into a subterranean world occupied by beings who seem to resemble angels. He befriends the first being he meets, who guides him around a city  that is reminiscent of ancient Egyptian architecture. The explorer meets his host's wife, two sons and daughter who learn to speak English by way of a makeshift [[dictionary]] during which the narrator unconsciously teaches them the language. His guide comes towards him, and he and his daughter, Zee, explain who they are and how they function.

The hero discovers that these beings, who call themselves Vril-ya, have great telepathic and other parapsychological abilities, such as being able to [[Telepathy|transmit information]], [[Analgesic|get rid of pain]], and [[Hypnosis|put others to sleep.]] The narrator is offended by the idea that the Vril-ya are better adapted to learn about him than he is to learn about them. Nevertheless, the guide (who turns out to be a magistrate) and his son Taee behave kindly towards him.

The narrator soon discovers that the Vril-ya are descendants of an [[antediluvian]] civilization called the Ana, who live in networks of subterranean caverns linked by tunnels. Originally surface dwellers, they had fled underground thousands of years ago to escape a massive flood and gained greater power by facing and dominating the harsh conditions of the Earth. The place where the narrator descended housed 12,000 families, one of the largest groups. Their society was a technologically supported Utopia, chief among their tools being an "all-permeating fluid" called "Vril", a latent source of energy that the spiritually elevated hosts are able to master through training of their will, to a degree that depended on their hereditary constitution. This mastery gave them access to an extraordinary force that could be controlled at will. It is this fluid that the Vril-ya employed to communicate with the narrator. The powers of the Vril included the ability to heal, change, and destroy beings and things; the destructive powers in particular were powerful, allowing a few young Vril-ya children to destroy entire cities if necessary.

Men (called An, pronounced "Arn") and women (called Gy, pronounced "Gee") have equal rights. The women are stronger and larger than the men. The women are also the pursuing party of romantic relationships. They marry for just three years, after which the men choose whether to remain married, or be single. The female may then pursue a new husband. However, they seldom make the choice to remarry.

Their religion posits the existence of a superior being but does not dwell on his nature. The Vril-ya believe in the permanence of life, which according to them is not destroyed but merely changes form.

The narrator adopts the attire of his hosts and begins also to adopt their customs. Zee falls in love with him and tells her father, who orders Taee to kill him with his staff. Eventually both Taee and Zee conspire against such a command, and Zee leads the narrator through the same chasm which he first descended. Returning to the surface, he warns that in time the Vril-ya will run out of habitable space underground and will claim the surface of the Earth, destroying mankind in the process, if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bulwer Lytton|first1=Edward|title=Vril: The Power of the Coming Race|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Vril:_The_Power_of_the_Coming_Race;_The_New_Utopia|website=wikisource.com|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vril in the novel===

The uses of Vril in the novel amongst the Vril-ya vary from destruction to healing. According to Zee, the daughter of the narrator's host, Vril can be changed into the mightiest agency over all types of matter, both animate and inanimate. It can destroy like lightning or replenish life, heal, or cure. It is used to rend ways through solid matter. Its light is said to be steadier, softer and healthier than that from any flammable material. It can also be used as a power source for animating mechanisms. Vril can be harnessed by use of the Vril staff or mental concentration.

A Vril staff is an object in the shape of a wand or a staff which is used as a channel for Vril. The narrator describes it as hollow with "stops", "keys", or "springs" in which Vril can be altered, modified, or directed to either destroy or heal. The staff is about the size of a walking stick but can be lengthened or shortened according to the user's preferences. The appearance and function of the Vril staff differs according to gender, age, etc. Some staves are more potent for destruction; others, for healing. The staves of children are said to be much simpler than those of sages; in those of wives and mothers, the destructive part is removed while the healing aspects are emphasised.

==Literary significance and reception==

The book was quite popular in the late 19th century, and for a time the word "Vril" came to be associated with "life-giving elixirs".&lt;ref name = "dav"&gt;{{Citation | first = David | last = Seed | origyear = 1870 | title = The Coming Race | first2 = Sir Edward | last2 = Bulwer‐Lytton | publisher = Wesleyan University Press | date = 2007 | pages = xvii, 159}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The best known use of "Vril" in this context is in the name of [[Bovril]] (a [[blend word]] of Bovine and Vril).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Peter | last = Hadley | title = A History of Bovril Advertising | place = London | publisher = Bovril | date = 1972 | page = 13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; From 5 to 7 March 1891, there was even a "Vril-ya Bazaar" held at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 48ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has shown that Bulwer-Lytton developed his ideas about "Vril" against the background of his long preoccupation with occult natural forces, which were widely discussed at that time, especially in relation to [[animal magnetism]] or, later, [[spiritualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 13–44.&lt;/ref&gt; In his earlier novels ''[[Zanoni]]'' (1842) and ''A Strange Story'' (1862), Bulwer-Lytton had discussed electricity and other "material agents" as the possible natural causes for occult phenomena. In ''The Coming Race'', those ideas are continued in the context of a satirical critique of contemporary philosophical, scientific, and political currents. In a letter to his friend John Forster, Bulwer-Lytton explained his motives:

{{bq|1=I did not mean Vril for mesmerism, but for electricity, developed into uses as yet only dimly guessed, and including whatever there may be genuine in mesmerism, which I hold to be a mere branch current of the one great fluid pervading all nature. I am by no means, however, wedded to Vril, if you can suggest anything else to carry out this meaning namely, that the coming race, though akin to us, has nevertheless acquired by hereditary transmission, etc., certain distinctions which make it a different species, and contains powers which we could not attain to through a slow growth of time; so that this race would not amalgamate with, but destroy us. [...]

Now, as some bodies are charged with electricity like the torpedo or electric eel, and never can communicate that power to other bodies, so I suppose the existence of a race charged with that electricity and having acquired the art to concentre and direct it in a word, to be conductors of its lightnings. If you can suggest any other idea of carrying out that idea of a destroying race, I should be glad. Probably even the notion of Vril might be more cleared from mysticism or mesmerism by being simply defined to be electricity and conducted by those staves or rods, omitting all about mesmeric passes, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Victor Alexander Robert | last = Lytton | title = The Life of Edward Bulwer Lytton, First Lord Lytton, vol. 1 |url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofedwardbulw00lyttuoft| place = London | publisher = Macmillan and Co. | date = 1913 | page = 466f.}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bulwer-Lytton has been regarded as an "initiate" or "adept" by esotericists, especially because of his [[Rosicrucian]] novel ''Zanoni'' (1842). However, there is no historical evidence that suggests that Bulwer-Lytton can be seen as an occultist, or that he has been the member of any kind of esoteric association. Instead, it has been shown that Bulwer-Lytton has been "esotericized" since the 1870s. In 1870, the [[Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia]] appointed Bulwer-Lytton as her "Grand Patron." Although Bulwer-Lytton complained about this by letter in 1872, the claim has never been revoked. Other claims, such as his membership in a German [[masonic]] lodge ''Zur aufgehenden Morgenröthe'', have been proven wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 55–74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those claims, as well as the recurrent esoteric topics in Bulwer-Lytton's works, convinced some commentators that the fictionalised Vril was based on a real magical force. [[Helena Blavatsky]], the founder of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], endorsed this view in her book ''Isis Unveiled'' (1877) and again in ''The Secret Doctrine'' (1888). In Blavatsky, the Vril power and its attainment by a superhuman elite are worked into a mystical doctrine of race. However, the character of the subterranean people was transformed. Instead of potential conquerors, they were benevolent (if mysterious) spiritual guides. Blavatsky's recurrent homage to Bulwer-Lytton and the Vril force has exerted a lasting influence on other esoteric authors.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 69ff., 77ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophist]] [[William Scott-Elliot]] describes life in [[Atlantis]] in {{Citation | title = The Story of Atlantis &amp; The Lost Lemuria | edition = first | date = 1896}}, the aircraft of the Atlanteans are propelled by Vril-force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = L Sprague | last = de Camp | title = [[Lost Continents]] | date = 1954 | edition = first | page = 67}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His books are still published by the [[Theosophical Society]]. Scott-Elliot's description of Atlantean aircraft has been identified as an early inspiration for authors who have related the Vril force to [[UFO]]s after World War II.

[[George Bernard Shaw]] read the book and was attracted to the idea of Vril, according to [[Michael Holroyd]]'s biography of him.

French writer [[Jules Lermina]] included a Vril-powered flying machine in his {{Citation | language = French | date = 1910 | type = novel | title = L'Effrayante Aventure | trans-title = Panic in Paris}}.

==Stage adaptation==

A stage adaptation of the book was written by journalist [[David Christie Murray]] and magician [[Nevil Maskelyne (magician)|Nevil Maskelyne]]. The production premiered at [[St. George's Hall, London|Saint George's Hall]] in London on 2 January 1905. Both Nevil Maskelyne and his father [[John Nevil Maskelyne]] collaborated on the special effects for the play. The play did not meet with success and closed after a run of eight weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jim | last = Steinmeyer | author-link = Jim Steinmeyer | title = Hiding the Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible and Learned to Disappear | publisher = Carrol &amp; Graf | type = trade paperback | date = 2004 | pages = 184–85}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Willy Ley]] was a German rocket engineer who had emigrated to the United States in 1937.&lt;!-- or 1933 or 1935; 1937 says the German wiki-article on him--&gt; In 1947, he published an article titled "Pseudoscience in Naziland" in the magazine ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Willy | last = Ley |date=May 1947 | title = Pseudoscience in Naziland | journal = Astounding Science Fiction | volume = 39 | issue = 3 | pages = 90–98 | url = http://www.alpenfestung.com/ley_pseudoscience.htm | publisher = Alpenfestung}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the high popularity of irrational convictions in Germany at that time explained how National Socialism could have fallen on such fertile ground. Among various pseudoscientific groups he mentions one that looked for the Vril: 
"The next group was literally founded upon a novel. That group which I think called itself 'Wahrheitsgesellschaft'&amp;nbsp;— Society for Truth&amp;nbsp;—and which was more or less localised in Berlin, devoted its spare time looking for Vril."

===Jacques Bergier and Louis Pauwels===
The existence of a Vril Society was alleged in 1960 by [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2002), 113.&lt;/ref&gt; In their book ''[[The Morning of the Magicians]]'', they claimed that the Vril-Society was a secret community of occultists in pre-Nazi [[Berlin]] that was a sort of inner circle of the [[Thule Society]]. They also thought that it was in close contact with the English group known as the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]. The Vril information takes up about a tenth of the volume, the remainder of which details other esoteric speculations, but the authors fail to clearly explain whether this section is fact or fiction. Historians have shown that there has been no actual historical foundation for the claims of Pauwels and Bergier, and that the article of Willy Ley has only been a vague inspiration for their own ideas. Nevertheless, Pauwels and Bergier have influenced a whole new literary genre dealing with the alleged occult influences on National Socialism which have often been related to the fictional Vril Society.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 126–142.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Monsieur Gurdjieff'', Louis Pauwels&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = Amazon | title = Monsieur Gurdjieff | first = Louis | last = Pauwels | language = French | place = [[France|FR]]| id =  {{ASIN|2226081968|country=fr}} }}.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that a Vril Society had been founded by General [[Karl Haushofer]], a student of [[Russia]]n magician and metaphysician [[George Gurdjieff|Georges Gurdjieff]].

===Publications on the Vril Society in German===
The book of [[Jacques Bergier]] and [[Louis Pauwels]] was published in [[German language|German]] with the title: ''Aufbruch ins dritte Jahrtausend: von der Zukunft der phantastischen Vernunft'' (literally ''Departure into the Third Millennium: The Future of the Fantastic Reason'') in 1969.

In his book [[Black Sun (Goodrick-Clarke book)|''Black Sun'']], [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Professor Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] refers to the research of the German author Peter Bahn. Bahn writes in his 1996 essay, "Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie" ("The Secret of Vril Energy"),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first= Peter |last= Bahn |title= Das Geheimnis der Vril-Energie: Berichte und Erfahrungen zu einer mächtigen Naturkraft |editor1-first= Adolf | editor1-last = Schneider |editor2-first= Inge |editor2-last= Schneider |work= Vorträge des Kongresses 1995 im Gwatt-Zentrum am Thunersee &lt;!-- Duplicate parameter --&gt;|place= Bern |publisher= Jupiter-Verlag A.+l. Schneider |date= 1996 |isbn= 3-906571-14-9 |pages= 137–46 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; of his discovery of an obscure esoteric group calling itself the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft", which revealed itself in a rare 1930 publication ''Vril. Die Kosmische Urkraft'' (Vril, the cosmic elementary power) written by a member of this Berlin-based group, under the pseudonym "Johannes Täufer" (German: "John [the] Baptist"). Published by the influential astrological publisher, Otto Wilhelm Barth (whom Bahn believes was "Täufer"), the 60-page pamphlet says little of the group other than that it was founded in 1925 to study the uses of Vril energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Johannes | last = Täufer | contribution = "Vril" Die Kosmische Urkraft Wiedergeburt von Atlantis | language = German | title = Herausgegeben im Auftrage der Reichsarbeitgemeinschaft "Das kommende Deutschland" Zentralbüro | place = Berlin W 57, Pallasstr. 7 | publisher = Astrologischer Verlag Wilhelm Becker: Berlin Steglitz, Schloßstraße 69 | date = 1930}}. [[:de:Datei:Vril Urkraft Einband.jpg|See image in German Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt; The German historian Julian Strube has argued that the historical existence of the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft" can be regarded as irrelevant to the post-war invention of the Vril Society, as Pauwels and Bergier have developed their ideas without any knowledge of that actual association.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 126–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Strube has also shown that the Vril force has been irrelevant to the other members of the "Reichsarbeitsgemeinschaft," who were supporters of the theories of the Austrian inventor Karl Schappeller (1875–1947).&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 98–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Esoteric neo-Nazism===
After World War II, a group referred to by Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke as the [[Landig Group|Vienna Circle]] elaborated an esoteric neo-Nazism that contributed to the circulation of the Vril topos in a new context.&lt;ref&gt;Goodrick-Clarke (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; In their writings, Vril is associated with [[Nazi UFOs]] and the [[Black Sun (occult symbol)|Black Sun]] concept. Julian Strube wrote that a younger generation related to the [[Neo-völkisch movements#Tempelhofgesellschaft|Tempelhofgesellschaft]], has continued the work of the Vienna Circle and exerts a continuous influence on the most common notions of Vril. Those notions are not only popular in neo-Nazi circles but also in movies or computer games, such as ''[[Iron Sky]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein (2009 video game)|Wolfenstein]]'', and ''[[Call of Duty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Strube (2013), 48ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
