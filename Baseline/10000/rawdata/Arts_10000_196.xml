The '''Amato Opera''' was an [[opera]] company located in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]] neighborhood of the [[Manhattan]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[New York City]]. The company was produced by the husband and wife team of Anthony and Sally Amato and presented opera on a small scale with a reduced orchestra at low prices. Over its 61 years in existence, it encouraged and trained many young singers.

==Early years==
The company was founded in 1948 by husband and wife team Anthony (July 21, 1920 &amp;ndash; December 13, 2011) and Sally Bell Amato (September 27, 1917 &amp;ndash; August 16, 2000). Tony Amato acted as artistic director, choosing the repertoire, rehearsing and conducting the operas. In the early productions, he often cast students from his opera classes at The America Theatre Wing, where he was the Director of the Opera Workshop. There was no admission charge for the company's early performances, because union rules prohibited it. Instead, during the intermission the Amatos would "pass the hat around" for contributions. Sally acted as costumier, ran lights and box office and managed publicity and business matters. Under the alias Serafina Bellantoni, she sang in productions for over fifty years.&lt;ref name=Diaz&gt;Diaz, Sondra Zuckerman. [http://www.amato.org// "From Dreams to Reality: Fifty Years of the Amato Opera"], originally published in the Opera Circle newsletter in 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Their first production, [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini's]] ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'', was mounted in the auditorium of [[Our Lady of Pompeii Church (Manhattan)|Our Lady of Pompeii Church]] at [[Bleecker Street|Bleecker]] and Carmine Streets.&lt;ref name=Wakin /&gt; The following week, the company produced ''[[Cavalleria rusticana]]'' and ''[[Pagliacci]]''. The company used many other locations in its early years, including the Kaufman Auditorium of the [[92nd Street Y]], the [[Fashion Institute of Technology]], and [[Washington Irving High School (New York City)|Washington Irving High School]] auditorium.

In 1951, the company moved into its first permanent home at 159 Bleecker Street. In its new 299-seat theatre, the company gave four performances during nearly every weekend of the year. The company's repertory soon spanned 21 different operas, and it gave over 1,296 performances at the theatre. Productions were occasionally presented in nearby cities, such as [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut]], and abridged children's performances were also given at [[The Town Hall]]. The Bleecker Street theatre closed in 1959, but the company continued to perform at other venues, including The Town Hall and 126 West [[23rd Street (Manhattan)|23rd Street]].&lt;ref name=Diaz /&gt;

==Later years==
[[File:Tony Amato.jpg|thumb|upright|Anthony Amato]]
Amato found a new permanent home in 1964 in a four-story building, next to a gas station and near the famous rock club [[CBGB]], at 319 [[Bowery]] near Second Street, a former Mission House and restaurant supply store, which was converted into a theatre with rehearsal and storage space, 107-seats, a 20-foot stage and a tiny orchestra pit.&lt;ref name=Diaz /&gt;

Each season included five or six different operas, typically a mix of comedies and tragedies, and the repertory eventually expanded to over 60 operas.&lt;ref name=Wakin /&gt; Each opera ran over five weekends, and the company used multiple rotating casts. Amato also mounted Saturday morning Opera-In-Brief performances. Aimed at children, the Opera-In-Brief performances are full-length short operas or abridged versions of longer operas interspersed with narration. Throughout its life, Amato Opera maintained a policy of keeping prices low, charging only $1.80 a seat in 1964. By 1975 ticket prices were $3–4 and in 1998, they were $23. In 2008, tickets were $35 ($30 for students, children, and seniors), still modest compared to those at larger opera houses.&lt;ref name=Wakin&gt;Wakin, Daniel J. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/13/arts/music/13amat.html "Shock Greets Move to Close Amato Opera in May",] ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 12, 2009 (website requires registration)&lt;/ref&gt; [[PBS]] made a documentary film about Amato in 2001 called ''Amato: A Love Affair With Opera''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/amato/index.html PBS documentary: "Amato: A Love Affair with Opera"], 2001&lt;/ref&gt; PBS wrote, "The Amato Opera has grown famous as a testing ground for young singers; many of its performers have gone on to sing, direct, and conduct in opera companies around the world ... The orchestra is phenomenal. The sets, designed by Richard Cerullo for the past twenty years, are wonderfully designed to make the most of the Amato's small stage. And what the theater lacks in seating capacity it makes up for in intimacy."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/amato/about.html "About the Amato Opera"], PBS website for "Amato: A Love Affair with Opera", 2001, accessed October 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Amato Opera received commendations and awards from Mayors [[Abraham Beame|Abe Beame]], [[Ed Koch]] and [[Rudy Giuliani]], and the Amatos were inducted into [[City Lore]]'s Peoples' Hall of Fame, honored by the American Cultural Roundtable, and the Italian Heritage and Cultural Committee, in recognition for their contribution to the artistic life of New York City.

==Closure==
Amato Opera closed after its last performance of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' on May 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steve. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/02/arts/music/02amat.html?hp "Shoestring Opera's Grand Exit",] ''The New York Times'', June 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Amato announced the planned closure on January 10, 2009, before a performance of ''[[The Merry Widow]]''. He told ''[[The New York Times]]'', "Now, with Sally gone, I have decided that it is time for me to start a new chapter in my life".&lt;ref name="Wakin" /&gt;

Following the closure of the Amato Opera, some of the former performers and members of the Amato board of directors formed Amore Opera. Tony Amato gave all the sets and costumes of Amato Opera to this new company.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steve. [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/06/arts/music/06amore.html "An Opera on Both Their Houses"]. ''The New York Times'', December 4, 2009, accessed March 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Amore Opera has continued to present opera seasons since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amoreopera.org/ Official Amore Opera website], accessed March 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Another successor company, Bleecker Street Opera, performed from 2010 through 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Stephen. [http://eastvillage.thelocal.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/bleecker-street-opera-to-close/ Local East Village], accessed June 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2013, another former Amato performer formed Opera Theatre of [[Montclair, New Jersey|Montclair in New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Romeo, Lisa.

In 2010, Amato published a book about the company called ''The Smallest Grand Opera in the World''.&lt;ref&gt;Amato, Tony and Rochelle Mancini.

[[Image:WILLIAM BLAKE 1820 PORTRAIT BY JOHN LINNELL JPEG 1.JPG|150px|thumb|Portrait of William Blake drawn by [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]] (1820)]]

'''The Ancients''' (also known as the '''Shoreham Ancients''') were a group of young English artists and others who were brought together around 1824 by their attraction to archaism in art and admiration for the work of [[William Blake]] (1757-1827), who was a generation or two older than the group. The core members of the Ancients were [[Samuel Palmer]], [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]], and [[Edward Calvert (painter)|Edward Calvert]]. Except for Palmer, the central members who were artists were all students at the [[Royal Academy of Arts]]. They met in Blake's apartment, dubbed the "House of Interpreter"&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Wilcox, ''Samuel Palmer'' (London: Tate, 2005), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the home of Samuel Palmer in the [[Kent]] village of [[Shoreham, Kent|Shoreham]].  The Ancients made little impact on the English artistic scene during the ten years or so that the group continued, but several members were later significant artists, and interest in the group has gradually increased since the late 19th-century.

They were the first English manifestation of the formalised artistic "brotherhood", an artistic movement whose aims included elements of communal living and promotion of a general vision for society. Continental groups of this sort included the German [[Nazarene movement]] and the Barbus in Paris, and the most successful later English example was to be the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]].  Like these groups they represented an oppositional break-away from the academic art establishment, and looked back to an idealized version of the past. They pursued equality among their members as a reaction to the hierarchical structure of the conventional art world.  Like Nazarenes and Barbus, they promoted the wearing of special revivalist costume, though only Palmer seems often to have worn it in practice; it seems to be shown in some portraits of Palmer by Richmond such as the bust-length miniature and chalk drawing (1829, both [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]]), which shows a round-necked pleated [[Smock-frock|smock]] under a coat with a loose untidy collar and lapels, combined with somewhat Christ-like long hair and a beard.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 17-20, 105-106, 129; see also drawings at Yale on Wikimedia Commons&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ancients were probably aware of the Nazarenes, but probably not of the Barbus.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 18-19 argues they must have known of the Nazarenes; though Paley, 99-100, is not so sure.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Group aims and activity==
[[File:George Richmond - Samuel Palmer - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] drawing of [[Samuel Palmer]] wearing "Ancient" clothing, 1830]]
Unlike Blake they were mostly [[High Tory]] in politics, but equally distrustful of the modern mercantile society booming around them, and looked back to an idealized [[ruralist]] past.  They never produced a manifesto, and their activities and relationships are poorly documented; Palmer's son later destroyed most of his father's papers from the period, hinting darkly that they contained sexual material showing "a mental condition ... full of danger, and neither sufficiently masculine nor sufficiently reticent".  Most of the information about the group's activities and dynamics comes from memoirs by them or their families and friends recalled several decades later.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 18-21, 20 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Their name may have come from John Giles, Palmer's stockbroker cousin, who despite being no artist was an important figure in the group and perhaps the initial instigator, as Palmer's son suggested.  He is recorded as very often extolling the superiority of "the ancients" in any context that occurred in conversation, though the word is also an important one for Blake.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 98-99; Vaughan, 18, 105&lt;/ref&gt; At this period "ancient" was a vaguer term than in modern English, often used to refer to the medieval or even Renaissance, as in the English legal term "Ancient Monument".

Christiana Payne, in the ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'', states, &lt;blockquote&gt; "Their subject-matter was drawn from the Bible, or from a vision of a golden age of [[pastoral]] innocence and abundance that had both Christian and [[Virgil|Vergilian]] overtones."&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Art Online, Subscription only: http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T002673&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The artist members submitted works for the Royal Academy exhibitions, many of which were exhibited, but these "stimulated no critical enthusiasm and were evidently not considered sufficiently threatening to provoke outrage, as the Pre-Raphaelites were to do a generation later".  None of the exhibited works seem to have been sold, and the group received very few commissions for works in "Ancient" style, though Richmond's successful career as a conventional portraitist took off in the early 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 20-21, 20 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;  Nor did the people of Shoreham seem to take objection to Palmer and his visitors, though he records they were known by some locals as the '''Extollagers''', an attempt at "[[astrologer]]s".  Palmer added other local properties to his house there, which he rented out for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 19-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Nazarene Brotherhood and the Barbus were able to attempt communal living in abandoned monasteries outside Rome and Paris respectively, but these convenient possibilities on the continent in the Napoleonic period were not available in the London of the 1820s, so Palmer encouraged long-term stays at his house in Shoreham or elsewhere in the village.  Most members had commitments of work or family in London that meant their visits were of weeks if not days, and only William Palmer and Welby Sherman seem to have stayed longer.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 19, 105-106&lt;/ref&gt; Blake himself made the trip at least once.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 105&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:George Richmond self-portrait 1830 gouache.jpg|thumb|left|[[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]] self-portrait, 1830, [[gouache]]]]

The artist [[John Linnell (painter)|John Linnell]]  (1792—1882) was not a member of the group however he was close to most of the members.  Palmer's reference to Linnell's young daughters as "little ancients" in a letter to him of September 1824 is a key piece of evidence as to the date the group was formed (Palmer later married one of them, Hannah).&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 18&lt;/ref&gt;  Linnel was seven years older than Calvert, the oldest in the group, and a strong-minded person who disagreed with many of the group's positions.  In a letter to Palmer years later he wrote that "I ought to remember that I was not one of the monthly-meeting ''elite''— when at the Platonic feast of reason and soul only real Greeks from [[Hackney (parish)|Hackney]] and [[Lisson Grove]] were admitted".&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 103&lt;/ref&gt; Linnell was probably mainly responsible for introducing Palmer and the others to northern European art of the 15th and 16th centuries, which was then relatively little-known in England.  He knew Charles (Karl) Aders, a German businessman living in London who had an important collection of early Northern paintings, including a copy of the ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'', which Linnell enabled the group to visit.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, 18-19, 101-102; Paley, 103-104. Aders' collection was sold in London in 1835; he and his wife were also friends with [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 Palmer received a further legacy, with which he bought a cottage in [[St John's Wood]] in London, and thereafter he gradually spent more time in London. The monthly dinners to which Linnell's letter refers were usually held there.  Palmer and Richmond with their wives left together for an extended visit to Italy in 1837, which may be taken as the final end of the group, though most members continued as friends long afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 108-112&lt;/ref&gt;  The exposure in Italy to art in the classical tradition influenced both artists to move away from Ancient primitivism.  The proximity of Shoreham to the [[Captain Swing]] campaign of insurgency among rural labourers in 1830, which Palmer violently opposed, may have disillusioned him as to the peace and harmony of rural life.&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 106-108&lt;/ref&gt;  Richmond wrote in a letter to Palmer in later life "We all wanted thrashing when in a dream of sentiment we thought we were learning art".&lt;ref&gt;Paley, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4853">'''Anti-fashion''' is an umbrella term for various styles of dress which are explicitly contrary to the [[fashion]] of the day. Anti-fashion styles may represent an attitude of indifference or may arise from political or practical goals which make fashion a secondary priority. The term is sometimes even used for styles championed by high-profile designers, when they encourage or create trends that do not follow the mainstream fashion of the time. This anti-fashion was adopted in response to the 'overly fashion conscious' fans of bands such as the [[Sex Pistols]].&lt;ref name = "communication"&gt;{{citation

==Overview==
[[Grunge]] is an example of the oppositional style of dress while the [[rational dress]] of the Victorian era, which allowed ladies to swim or bicycle, is an example of a functional anti-fashion.&lt;ref name = "alternative"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wy_-5HFcOrwC&amp;pg=PA77 |title=Alternative femininities |author=Samantha Holland |chapter=Anti-fashion and feminism|isbn=9781859738085 |date=2004-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A trend for feminist women to dress in ways that do not follow the norms for women's clothing has been described as anti-fashion, though research suggested many women who dress this way do not choose to label themselves this way, in the opinion of author Samantha Holland this is because the women do not like the confrontational overtones of the term.&lt;ref name = "alternative"/&gt;

==History==
In the 1990s, a [[minimalist]] style described as anti fashion emerged on both sides of the Atlantic where young people would typically wear simple clothes such as black jeans and white T-shirts without a visible brand name. Another period of anti-fashion has taken place in the 1950s with the advent of rock and roll, especially with young adolescent women.

Instead of the standard of wearing a dress or skirt, particularly hoop skirts and poodle skirts, many young women wore [[jeans]] and plaid shirts, or simple plain [[T shirt]]s in rebellion with the [[gender role]]s and societal norms at that time. This fashion has the roots of many modern anti-fashion trends, such as grunge, decades later.

==Examples==
Another example, this time from the early 20th century, was promoted by the legendary designer [[Coco Chanel|Gabrielle Chanel]] - a  "poor girl" woman's style where rich ladies could look like regular women while still dressing in clothes that showed their quality under close inspection.&lt;ref name = "adorned"&gt;{{citation

The dress sense of the [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] has been described as anti fashion, in that it reflects indifference to current fashion in favor of traditional style.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Anti-fashion has also been used to describe simple fashion adopted by hardcore [[punk subculture|punks]] in the 1980s. At its strictest, it consists of a plain white T-shirt, black trousers or plain jeans and black boots, with the hair cut short.

==2017 Museum exhibition studying anti-fashion==
Starting in May 2017 fashion/anti-fashion is one of the thematic fashion pairings which was examined in an exhibit studying the works of [[Rei Kawakubo]] at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Time magazine. Kawakubo announcement of 2017 exhibit. [http://time.com/4540904/comme-des-garcons-rei-kawakubo-met-gala-theme-2017/]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Bolton (curator)|Andrew Bolton]], the curator for the Kawakubo exhibit at the Met stated that the exhibit in May 2017 will be an austere, all-white maze hosting approximately 150 Comme ensembles. Both the exhibit and accompanying book by Bolton are based upon the recurrent fashion dichotomies concentrating on eight thematic oppositions listed as: (1) fashion/anti-fashion; (2) design/not design; (3) model/multiple; (4) then/now; (5) high/low; (6) self/other; (7) object/subject; and (8) clothes/not clothes.&lt;ref name="Lynn Yaeger 2017"&gt;Lynn Yaeger.

'''Arabic calligraphy''' is the artistic practice of [[penmanship|handwriting]] and [[calligraphy]]&lt;!-- and by extension, [[bookbinding|bookmaking]],--&gt; based on the [[Arabic alphabet]].  It is known in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] as ''khatt'' ({{lang-ar|خط}}), derived from the word 'line', 'design', or 'construction'.&lt;ref name=typography&gt;{{cite web| title=Arabic calligraphy as a typographic exercise| url=http://ilovetypography.com/2008/07/10/arabic-calligraphy-as-a-typographic-exercise/ |author=Julia Kaestle |date=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Widany2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Stefan Widany|title=The History of Arabic Calligraphy - an Essay on Its Greatest Artists and Its Development|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0Wyt3dh5rYC|date=June 2011|publisher=GRIN Verlag|isbn=978-3-640-93875-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Kufic]] is the oldest form of the [[Arabic script]].

Although most [[Islamic calligraphy]] is in Arabic and most Arabic calligraphy is Islamic, the two are not identical. [[Coptic Christian]] manuscripts in Arabic, for example, may make use of calligraphy. Likewise, there is Islamic [[Persian calligraphy|calligraphy in Persian]].

Early '''architectural photographers''' include [[Roger Fenton]], [[Francis Frith]] (Middle East and Britain), [[Samuel Bourne]] (India) and [[Albert Levy (photographer)|Albert Levy]] (United States and Europe). They paved the way for the modern speciality of [[architectural photography]]. Later architectural photography had practitioners such as [[Ezra Stoller]] and [[Julius Shulman]]. Stoller worked mainly on the east coast of America, having graduated with a degree in architecture in the 1930s. Shulman, who was based on the West Coast, became an architectural photographer after some images that he had taken of one of [[Richard Neutra]]'s houses in California made their way onto the architect's desk.

The opening was mired by an intended boycott by sixty actors, writers, and directors, including [[Joshua Sobol]], who refuse to perform in settlements because it would "strengthen the settlement enterprise".

Authors [[Michael Baigent]] and [[Richard Leigh (author)|Richard Leigh]] alleged that fellow author [[Dan Brown]] had cannibalised their book ''[[The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail]]'' in writing ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]''.&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web

It tells of the  destruction of the [[fianna]] and the deaths of most of its warriors in a battle against the forces of [[High King of Ireland|High King]] [[Cairbre Lifechair]]. It is notable for depicting the fianna, the heroes of the cycle, in a negative light.&lt;ref name="MacKillop"&gt;MacKillop, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Cath Gabhra'' exists in many versions, and is referenced often in other works, including poems about Cairbre Lifechair in the [[Book of Leinster]] and in the long narrative ''[[Acallam na Senórach]]''. Cairbre's daughter Sgiam Sholais is betrothed to Maolsheachlainn, prince of the [[Déisi]], whose father Oengus has been killed by Cairbre's sons [[Fíacha Sroiptine]] and Eochaid Doimlen. However, the fianna and [[Fionn mac Cumhaill]] demand a large tribute for the marriage, and Cairbre decides their power has corrupted them. He raises a vast army from [[Ulster]], [[Leinster]], and [[Connacht]], which is joined by the faction of the fianna loyal to Fionn's enemy [[Goll mac Morna]]. Fionn and the fianna are aided by the men of [[Munster]] and the Déisi. Cairbre starts the final battle by killing Fionn's servant Ferdia, and the armies meet at Gabhair for the final confrontation. The fianna's greatest warrior, Fionn's grandson [[Oscar (Irish mythology)|Oscar]] (the son of [[Oisín]]), slays Cairbre, but dies of his wounds, thereby sealing the fianna's fate. In some versions, Fionn himself is slain by Aichlech while he weeps over the death of his grandson. Cairbre's forces ultimately triumph, and the only survivors of the fianna are Oisín and [[Caílte mac Rónáin]], who live long enough to recount their tale to [[Saint Patrick]] two centuries later, according to ''Acallam na Senórach''.

The location of the battle varies from text to text. Gabhra is generally considered identical to the modern [[Garristown]], [[County Dublin]], but other texts place it in Glenn Gabhra, situated between the hills of [[Hill of Tara|Tara]] and [[Skryne]],  [[County Meath]].&lt;ref name="MacKillop"/&gt; Some chronicles give the date of battle as 284.&lt;ref name="MacKillop"/&gt;

A '''Chiwara''' (also '''Chi wara''', '''Ci Wara''', or '''Tyi Wara'''; {{lang-bm|ciwara}}; {{lang-fr|tchiwara}}) is a ritual object representing an [[antelope]], used by the [[Bambara people|Bambara]] ethnic group in [[Mali]]. The Chiwara initiation society uses Chiwara masks, as well as dances and rituals associated primarily with agriculture, to teach young Bamana men social values as well as agricultural techniques.

== Stylistic variations ==
Chiwara masks are categorized in three ways: [[Horizontal plane|horizontal]], [[vertical direction|vertical]], or abstract. In addition, Chiwara can be either male or female. Female Chiwara masks are denoted by the presence of a baby antelope and straight horns. Male Chiwara masks have bent horns and a [[phallus]]. The sex of a Chiwara mask is much clearer on horizontal and vertical masks while abstract masks tend to be difficult to classify.

The appearance of the Chiwara form varies greatly both by region and time produced. Specific master wood carvers also subtly modified the accepted (or even religiously mandated) local forms, forming a distinct "signature" or "school" of Chiwara figures.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Wardwell (November 1984) A Bambara Master Carver, ''African Arts'', '''18'''(1):pp83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;   These regional variations have been roughly assigned the stylistic categories above. Thus ''the [[Bougouni]] / Southern region style'' are an amalgam of several animal motifs combined in the same work, in an abstract style; ''the [[Bamako]] / Northern region style'' is usually of the horizontal style; ''the [[Ségou|Segu]]/ Northern region style'' (the heartland of the [[Bambara Empire]]) matches the vertical style with the unique "cut out" triangular body motif of the males. Other regional styles have been proposed, including ''the [[Sikasso]] region style'', with a thin, delicate, vertical form within almost human, snoutless face.&lt;ref&gt;See descriptions at  [http://www.quaibranly.fr/en/programmation/exhibitions/last-exhibitions/ciwara-african-chimeras/index.html Ciwara, African chimeras.

==Ceremonial usage==
In [[Bambara language|Bambara]], ''chi'' ''wara'' means ''laboring'' ''wild animal'',&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Salzhauer Axel, Nina Sobol Levent (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; and is a representation of Bambara [[Mythology|mythos]] about the creation of farming.

=== Mousso Koroni ===
While there are several versions of the story, the discovery of agriculture is credited to the hero Chi Wara, a half antelope, half human figure born from the union of the sky goddess Mousso Koroni and an earth spirit in the shape of a cobra. The Chi Wara came to earth to teach humans to sow crops, and thus is honored at both sowing and harvest festivals.

=== The Chi Wara figure ===
The Chi Wara itself is usually represented as a [[Roan Antelope]] with an almost human face, but also takes shapes of other creatures and emblems of farming. The hero descends from the sky goddess, and thus represents the sun, its body is often elongated and short legged to represent the [[aardvark]] who burrows into the earth like a farmer. Its high horns echo the stalks of [[millet]], and it stands on a dancer clad in a mass of [[raffia]] stalks to represent both flowing water and a bountiful harvest. The zig-zag patterns echo the movement of the sun across the sky, and the penis of the male figure stands low to the ground, fertilizing the earth.
The Chi Wara figures always appear as a male/female pair, combining the elements of fertility of humans with fertility of the earth. The female figure usually carries a young antelope on her back, and is said to represent human beings carried by the Chi Wara hero, as well as a newborn human carried on a mother's back.

===''chi wara ton''===
As farmers of the upper [[Niger river]] [[savanna]], the blessing of agriculture is of central importance to Bambara society. These traditions survive in part because the Bambara were one of the last cultures in the area to embrace [[Islam]], after the fall of the [[Bambara Empire]] in the late 19th century.
Bambara culture has traditionally had a strict set of age and caste cofraternities (''ton''/''jo''/''jow''), and the ''chi wara ton'' society is one of the more important. It gathers all young adult males of the ''Soli'' age group to work the fields at clearing, sowing and harvest, when the greatest number of laborers is needed. Secret teachings of the ''chi wara ton'' pass the needed skills for this work, upon which the very survival of the community depends.

The ''chi wara ton'' is also the only major Bambara society which includes both sexes. Women's labor is needed for agriculture, just as both sexes are needed for human reproduction.

=== Dance ===
The Chi Wara is always danced with each wooden figure attached to a basket on the dancer's head, and the body covered in a huge pile of raffia. Often the face is obscured with raffia that has been colored or decorated, and the dancer carries a long staff. The figures are always in one or more male/female pairs, with the female usually dancing behind the male, fanning him and spreading his powers into the gathered community. The Male figures leap to represent the antelope, and then scratch the earth with their staves or horns as the Chi Wara teaches humans to cultivate crops. In some communities the Mousso Koroni figure also appears. Initiated children wear a "Sogono Kuni" ("Little antelope head"), which is quite rare to find in museums. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/chiwara.htm princetonol.com: Chi Wara Headdress of the Bamana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024353/http://www.princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/chiwara.htm |date=2007-09-27 }}.

== World influence ==
African sculptural forms became fashionable amongst European artists and collectors at the beginning of the Twentieth century, and the Chiwara, especially in its more abstract forms, became one of the icons of what Europeans called ''Primitive Art''. The artist [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] and collector [[Paul Guillaume]] published images of the Chiwara in their ''Sculptures nègres'' in 1917, while [[Picasso]], [[Braque]], and [[Les Fauves]] became fascinated with African sculpture and masks in general, and the Chiwara figure in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of French studies of African sculpture among the artists, critics, and collectors of Modern Art include: ''À propos d'art nègre'' by Guillaume Apollinaire; ''Opinions sur l'art nègre'' with contributions by Braque, [[Matisse]], and Picasso; ''Rencontre avec l'art nègre'' by [[Jean Laude]]; ''La Sculpture nègre et l'art moderne'' by Paul Guillaume; and  ''L'art nègre'' by [[Henri Clouzot]] and [[André Level]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A vertical, male, semi-abstracted Chiwara figure was included in the 1935 [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] exhibit ''African Negro Art'', and the ''Masterpieces of African Art'' at the [[Brooklyn Museum]] in 1954, (as well as shows in London&lt;ref&gt;The Sculptor [[Henry Moore]] singles out the Chiwara in a review of a 1951 London show. See Henry Moore. Tribal Sculpture: A Review of the Exhibition at the Imperial Institute. In Man, Vol. 51, Jul., 1951 (Jul., 1951), pp. 95-97&lt;/ref&gt; and Paris)  shows which were highly influential to western artists and collectors.&lt;ref&gt;For notes on this process see

'''Color Factory''' is a [[Pop-up exhibition|pop-up]] [[Interactive art|interactive]] [[art exhibition]] with brightly colored room-sized [[Installation art|installations]], each themed around the concept of [[color]]. It ran for eight and a half months in 2017 in [[San Francisco]], and, as of October 2018, is currently running in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jennawang/2018/09/29/the-rise-of-the-pop-up-economy|title=The Rise Of The Pop-Up Economy|last=Wang|first=Jenna|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecut.com/2018/06/the-color-factory-new-york-city.html|title=The Ultimate Instagram Exhibit Is Headed to New York City|last=Bedolla|first=Daise|work=The Cut|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/the-color-factory-experiential-art-exhibit-in-nyc-features-16-stunning-rooms-devoted-to-the-joy-of-color-10202362|title=The Instagram-Famous Color Factory Has 16 New Rooms With Built-In Cameras For Photo Opps|last=Lord|first=Emma|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Color Factory was founded in August 2017 by event-planner/blogger Jordan Ferney, artist Leah Rosenberg, and designer Erin Jang.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It originally debuted as a one-month, 15-installation, 12,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; exhibition in San Francisco, sponsored by [[Alaskan Airlines]] and Method Soap.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Due to its popularity (at one point causing its [[Eventbrite]] ticketing page to crash from high demand)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://sf.curbed.com/2017/7/31/16069956/color-factory-sf-tickets|title=Peek inside San Francisco’s newest Instagramable hotspot|work=Curbed SF|access-date=2018-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;, this San Francisco run was later extended to last for a total of eight and a half months.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In June and July 2018, Color Factory partnered with the [[Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum]] in New York City to exhibit the “[[Manhattan]] Color Walk”, an outdoor art installation which painted the ground with several stripes of colors, each sampled from a different street of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Art-Piece-Expresses-Colors-From-All-Across-Manhattan.html|title=Walk Displays Colors from 265 Blocks of NYC|work=NBC New York|access-date=2018-10-27|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Color Factory reopened as a temporary 16-installation, 20,000 ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; standalone exhibition in New York City's [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] neighborhood, sponsored by [[Maybelline]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Communication design''' is a mixed discipline between [[design]] and information-development which is concerned with how [[media (communication)|media]] intervention such as [[printing|printed]], [[craft]]ed, [[electronic media]] or [[presentations]] communicate with people. A communication design approach is not only concerned with developing the [[message]] aside from the [[aesthetic]]s in media, but also with creating new media channels to ensure the message reaches the target audience. Some designers use [[graphic design]] and communication design interchangeably due to overlapping skills.

Communication design can also refer to a systems-based approach, in which the totality of media and messages within a culture or organization are designed as a single integrated process rather than a series of discrete efforts. This is done through communication channels that aim to inform and attract the attention of the people one are focusing one's skills on. Design skills must be tailored to fit to different cultures of people, while maintaining pleasurable visual design. These are all important pieces of information to add to a media communications kit to get the best results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150413032136/http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/communicationstoolkit/pdf/Developing%20a%20Communication%20Plan.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the discipline of Communication, a framework for Communication as Design has emerged that focuses on redesigning interactivity and shaping communication [[Affordance|affordances]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aakhus|first=Mark|date=2007-03-01|title=Communication as Design|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637750701196383|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=74|issue=1|pages=112–117|doi=10.1080/03637750701196383|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software and applications create opportunities for and place constraints on communication. Recently, Guth and Brabham examined the way that ideas compete within a [[crowdsourcing]] platform, providing a model about the relationships among design ideas, communication, and platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guth|first=Kristen L.|last2=Brabham|first2=Daren C.|date=2017-08-04|title=Finding the diamond in the rough: Exploring communication and platform in crowdsourcing performance|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|journal=Communication Monographs|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–24|doi=10.1080/03637751.2017.1359748|issn=0363-7751}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors have interviewed technology company founders about the democratic ideals they build into the design of [[e-government]] applications and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brabham|first=Daren C.|last2=Guth|first2=Kristen L.|date=2017-08-01|title=The Deliberative Politics of the Consultative Layer: Participation Hopes and Communication as Design Values of Civic Tech Founders|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12316/abstract|journal=Journal of Communication|language=en|volume=67|issue=4|pages=445–475|doi=10.1111/jcom.12316|issn=1460-2466}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the Communication as Design framework is growing among researchers. 

==Overview==
Communication design seeks to attract, inspire, create desires and motivate the people to respond to messages, with a view to making a favorable impact to the bottom line of the commissioning body, which can be either to build a brand, move sales, or for humanitarian purposes. Its process involves strategic [[business]] thinking, using [[market research]], [[creativity]], and [[problem-solving]]. Communications designers translate ideas and information through a variety of media. Their particular talent lies not only in the traditional skills of the hand, but also in their ability to think strategically in design and marketing terms, in order to establish credibility through the communication.

The term communication design is often used interchangeably with [[visual communication]], but has an alternative broader meaning that includes [[Auditory system|auditory]], vocal, touch and smell. Examples of communication design include [[information architecture]], [[editing]], [[typography]], [[illustration]], [[web design]], [[animation]], [[advertising]], [[ambient media]], [[Brand management|visual identity design]], [[performing arts]], [[copywriting]] and [[professional writing]] skills applied in the [[creative industries]].

==Education==
Students of communication design learn how to create visual messages and broadcast them to the world in new and meaningful ways. In the complex [[digital environment]] around us, communication design has become a powerful means of reaching out to the [[target audience]]. Students learn how to combine communication with [[art]] and [[technology]]. Communication Design discipline involves teaching how to design [[Web page|web pages]], [[Video game|video games]], [[animation]], [[motion graphics]] and more.

Communication Design has content as its main purpose. It must achieve a reaction, or get customer to see a product in a genuine way to attract sales or get across a message. Students of Communications Design are often Illustrators, Graphic Designers, Web designers, Advertising artists, Animators, Video Editors or Motion graphic artists, or even printmakers and conceptual artists. The term Communications Design is fairly general and practitioners work in various mediums to get a message across.

CIAM promoted  [[modern architecture]] in the "Cubist style": the [[Bauhaus]], [[Weissenhof Estate|Weissenhof]], [[De Stijl]], and modern projects of the [[Palace of Nations]] in [[Geneva]]. Parallel movements of the 1920s include [[Expressionist architecture|Expressionism]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], [[Art Deco]], and [[Traditionalist School (architecture)|Traditionalism]].]]

The '''Congrès internationaux d'architecture moderne''' (CIAM), or International Congresses of [[Modern Architecture]], was an organization founded in 1928 and disbanded in 1959, responsible for a series of events and congresses arranged across Europe by the most prominent architects of the time, with the objective of spreading the principles of the [[Modern architecture|Modern Movement]] focusing in all the main domains of architecture (such as landscape, urbanism, industrial design, and many others).

==Formation and membership==

The International Congresses of Modern Architecture (CIAM) was founded in June 1928, at the Chateau de [[la Sarraz]] in Switzerland, by a group of 28 European architects organized by [[Le Corbusier]], Hélène de Mandrot (owner of the castle), and [[Sigfried Giedion]] (the first secretary-general). CIAM was one of many 20th century [[manifesto]]s meant to advance the cause of "architecture as a social art".

Other founder members included [[Karl Moser]] (first president), [[Hendrik Petrus Berlage|Hendrik Berlage]], [[Victor Bourgeois]], [[Pierre Chareau]], [[Sven Markelius]], [[Josef Frank (architect)|Josef Frank]], [[Gabriel Guevrekian]], Max Ernst Haefeli, [[Hugo Häring]], Arnold Höchel, Huib Hoste, [[Pierre Jeanneret]] (cousin of Le Corbusier), [[André Lurçat]], [[Ernst May]], [[Max Cetto]], Fernando García Mercadal, [[Hannes Meyer]], [[Werner M. Moser]], Carlo Enrico Rava, [[Gerrit Rietveld]], Alberto Sartoris, Hans Schmidt, [[Mart Stam]], Rudolf Steiger, Szymon Syrkus, Henri-Robert Von der Mühll, and Juan de Zavala. The Soviet delegates were to be [[El Lissitzky]], [[Nikolai Kolli]] and [[Moisei Ginzburg]], although at the Sarraz conference they were unable to obtain visas.

Other later members included [[Minnette de Silva]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Alvar Aalto]], [[Uno Åhrén]], [[Louis Herman De Koninck]] (1929) and [[Fred Forbát]]. In 1941, [[Harwell Hamilton Harris]] was chosen as secretary of the American branch of CIAM, which was the Chapter for Relief and Post War Planning, founded in [[New York City]].

[[Josep Lluís Sert]], co-founder of [[GATEPAC]] and [[GATCPAC]] (in [[Saragossa|Saragoza]] and [[Barcelona]], respectively) in 1930, as well as ADLAN (Friends of New Art) in Barcelona in 1932, participated in the congresses as of 1929, and served as CIAM president from 1947 to 1956.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=C4uNElGkBoYC&amp;pg=PA284&amp;lpg=PA284&amp;dq=CIAM+1929+Sert&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NhCO-MI962&amp;sig=tWngBDDQgFw4flUp-TWeg9d851k&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g6sMU8-cL_OZ0AXAj4FQ&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=CIAM%201929%20Sert&amp;f=false "The CIAM Discourse on Urbanism, 1928-1960"], by Eric Paul Mumford.

==Influence==

The organization was hugely influential. It was not only engaged in formalizing the architectural principles of the Modern Movement, but also saw architecture as an economic and political tool that could be used to improve the world through the design of buildings and through [[urban planning]].

The fourth CIAM meeting in 1933 was to have been held in Moscow. The rejection of Le Corbusier's competition entry for the [[Palace of the Soviets]], a watershed moment and an indication that the Soviets had abandoned CIAM's principles, changed those plans. Instead it was held onboard ship, the SS Patris II, which sailed from [[Marseille]] to [[Athens]].

Here the group discussed the principles of "The Functional City", which broadened CIAM's scope from architecture into urban planning. Based on an analysis of thirty-three cities, CIAM proposed that the social problems faced by cities could be resolved by strict functional segregation, and the distribution of the population into tall apartment blocks at widely spaced intervals. These proceedings went unpublished from 1933 until 1943, when Le Corbusier, acting alone, published them in heavily edited form as the "[[Athens Charter]]."

As CIAM members traveled worldwide after the war, many of its ideas spread outside Europe, notably to the USA. The city planning ideas were adopted in the rebuilding of Europe following [[World War II]], although by then some CIAM members had their doubts. [[Alison and Peter Smithson]] were chief among the dissenters. When implemented in the postwar period, many of these ideas were compromised by tight financial constraints, poor understanding of the concepts, or popular resistance. [[Mart Stam]]'s replanning of postwar Dresden in the CIAM formula was rejected by its citizens as an "all-out attack on the city."

The CIAM organization disbanded in 1959 as the views of the members diverged. Le Corbusier had left in 1955, objecting to the increasing use of English during meetings.

For a reform of CIAM, the group [[Team 10]] was active from 1953 onwards, and two different movements emerged from it: the [[New Brutalism]] of the English members (Alison and Peter Smithson) and the [[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]] of the Dutch members ([[Aldo van Eyck]] and [[Jacob B. Bakema]]).

==CIRPAC==
The elected executive body of CIAM was CIRPAC, the ''Comité international pour la résolution des problèmes de l’architecture contemporaine'' (International Committee for the Resolution of Problems in Contemporary Architecture).

[[File:De Constantia (titelpagina, 1584).png|thumb|right|''De Constantia'' (1584)]]
'''''De Constantia in publicis malis''''' ('''On constancy in times of public evil''') was a philosophical dialogue published by [[Justus Lipsius]] in two books in 1583. The book, modelled after the dialogues of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], was pivotal in establishing an accommodation of [[Stoicism]] and [[Christianity]] which became known as [[Neostoicism]]. ''De Constantia'' went through over eighty editions between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries.

==Themes==
Unlike his later books which synthesised the basic principles of [[Stoicism]] (albeit in Christianised form), in ''De Constantia'' Lipsius focuses on Stoicism's value in strengthening the mind against external troubles and anxieties.&lt;ref name="long"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Long|first=A.

Accessed 9 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The result is a handbook for practical living, and as such is focused more on moral rules than rigorous philosophical argument.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; Lipsius emphasises that the mind and the inner life is the site of true goodness.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; The central theme of the book is the need to cultivate voluntary and uncomplaining endurance of all human contingencies.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt;

==Legacy==
''De Constantia'' was Lipsius' most popular work.&lt;ref name="long"/&gt; Between the 16th and the 18th centuries, it went through more than eighty editions, of which over forty were in the original Latin and the rest were translations into vernacular European languages.&lt;ref name="papy"/&gt;

The '''eagle''' is used in [[heraldry]] as a [[charge (heraldry)|charge]], as a [[supporter]], and as a [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]]. The eagle with its keen eyes symbolized [[perspicacity]], courage, strength and immortality, but is also considered "king of the skies" and messenger of the highest gods. With these attributed qualities the eagle became a symbol of power and strength in [[Ancient Rome]]. It has been connected by the [[Greek mythology|Greeks]] with the god [[Zeus]], by the [[Roman mythology|Romans]] with [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], by the [[Germanic tribes]] with [[Odin]], by the [[Christianity and Judaism|Judeo-Christian]] scriptures with those who hope in [[Yahweh|God]] (Isaiah 40:31), and in [[Christian art]] with [[Saint John the Evangelist]].

==Symbolism==
[[Eagle (symbolism)|The eagle as a symbol]] has a history much longer than that of [[heraldry]] itself. In [[Ancient Egypt]], the falcon was the symbol of [[Horus]], and in Roman polytheism of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]. An eagle appears on the battle standard of [[Cyrus the Great]] in Persia, around 540 BC. The eagle as a "heraldic animal" of the [[Roman Republic]] was introduced in 102 BC by consul [[Gaius Marius]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
According to Islamic tradition, the [[Black Standard]] of [[Muhammad]] was known as {{lang|ar|راية العُقاب}} (''rāyat al-ʿuqāb'') "banner of the eagle" (even though it did not depict an eagle and was solid black). 
In Christian symbolism the four living creatures of scripture (a man, an ox, a lion, and an eagle) have traditionally been associated with the [[Four Evangelists]]. The eagle is the symbol of [[Saint John the Evangelist]].

In medieval and modern heraldry eagles are often said to indicate that the [[armiger]] (person bearing the arms) was courageous, a man of action and judicious.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
Where an eagle's wings were spread ("displayed") it was said to indicate the bearer's role as a protector.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In the same way that a [[lion (heraldry)|lion]] is considered the king of beasts, the eagle is regarded as the pre-eminent bird in heraldry. It has been more widely used and more highly regarded in [[Continental Europe]]an heraldry than in English heraldry. For instance, in the roll of [[Henry III of England]] (reigned 1216–1272) there are only three eagles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} &lt;!-- out of how many? compared to how many in an analogous continental roll? --&gt;

The depiction of the heraldic eagle is subject to a great range of variation in style.  The eagle was far more common in [[continental Europe]]an—particularly [[German heraldry|German]]—than [[English heraldry]], and it most frequently appears [[sable (heraldry)|''Sable'']] (colored black) with its beak and claws [[Or (heraldry)|''Or'']] (colored gold or yellow). It is often depicted ''membered'' (having limbs of a different color than the body) / ''armed'' (an animal depicted with its natural weapons of a different color than the body) and ''langued'' (depicted having a tongue of a different color than the body) ''[[gules]]'' (colored red), that is, with red claws / talons and tongue. In its relatively few instances in Gallo-British heraldry, the outermost feathers are typically longer and point upward.

===Parts===

====Head====
An eagle can appear either single- or [[double-headed eagle|double-headed]] (''bicapitate''). On at least one occasion a [[Triple-headed_eagle|three-headed]] (''tricapitate'') eagle is seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Waiblingen_%28kreis%29] granted in 1957 to Waiblingen (kreis) The three heads symbolise the three former territories that were transformed into the district.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Recursant'' describes an eagle with his head turned to the ''[[Sinister (heraldry)|sinister]]'' (left side of the field). ''In full aspect'' describes an eagle with his head facing the onlooker. ''In trian aspect'' (a rare, later 16th and 17th century heraldry term) describes when the eagle's head is facing at a three-quarter view to give the appearance of depth – with the head cocked at an angle somewhere between profile and straight-on.

====Wings====

''Overture'' or ''close'' is when the wings are shown at the sides and close to the body, always depicted ''statant'' (standing in profile and facing the right side of the field). (''Trussed'' - the term when depicting domestic or game birds with their wings ''closed'' - is not used because the eagle is a proud animal and the word implies it is tied up or bound by a net.)

''Addorsed'' ("back to back") is when the eagle is shown ''statant'' (standing in profile and facing the right side of the field) and ready to fly, with the wings shown open behind the eagle so that they almost touch.

''Espanie'' or ''épandre'' ("expanded") is when the eagle is shown ''affronté'' (facing the viewer with the head turned to the ''dexter'') and the wings are shown with the tips upward.

''Abaisé'' ("lowered") is when the eagle is shown ''affronté'' (facing the viewer) and the wings are shown with the tips downward. A good example is the eagle on the reverse side of the [[Quarter (United States coin)|US quarter dollar coin]].

''Klee-Stengeln'' ("clover-stems") are the pair of long-stemmed trefoil-type charges on the wings of 13th-century German depictions of the heraldic eagle. They represent the upper edge of the wings and are normally ''Or'' (yellow), like the beak and claws. [[Reinmar von Zweter]] fashioned the ''Klee-Stengeln'' of his eagle into a second and third head.&lt;ref&gt;Reinmar von Zweter's peculiar eagle is famously depicted in the [[Codex Manesse]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attitudes (positions)===
{{further|Attitude (heraldry)}}
There is a debate over whether ''rousant'' or ''displayed'' is the eagle's default depiction. ''Displayed'' is more common because it is more artistically pleasing and it fully uses the field's space. ''Displayed'' also predates the use of ''rousant'', with examples going back to the early Middle Ages.

There is also sometimes confusion between a ''rousant'' eagle with ''displayed'' wings and a ''displayed'' eagle. The difference is that ''rousant'' eagles face to the right and have their feet on the ground and ''displayed'' eagles face the viewer, have their legs splayed out, and the tail is completely visible.

====Eagle ''rousant''====
An eagle ''rising'' or ''rousant'' is preparing to fly, but its feet are still on the ground. It is the eagle's version of ''statant'' (standing in profile and facing the right side of the field). 
*''with wings addorsed and elevated'' means in profile with the wings swept to the back and their tips extended upwards. 
*''with wings addorsed and inverted'' means in profile with wings swept to the back and their tips extended downwards. 
*''with wings displayed and elevated'' means facing to the front with the wings spread and their tips extended upwards. 
*''with wings displayed and inverted'' means facing to the front with the wings spread and their tips extended downwards.

====Eagle ''displayed''====
{{anchor|spread eagle}}
The informal term "spread eagle" is derived from a heraldic depiction of an [[eagle]] ''displayed'' (i.e. upright with both wings, both legs, and tailfeathers all outstretched). The wings are usually depicted "expanded" or "elevated" (i.e., with the points upward); ''displayed inverted'' is when the wings are depicted points downward. According to Hugh Clark, ''An Introduction to Heraldry'', the term ''spread eagle'' refers to "an eagle with two heads, displayed",&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Hugh (1892). ''An Introduction to Heraldry, 18th ed.'' (Revised by J. R. Planché). London: George Bell &amp; Sons. First published 1775. {{ISBN|1-4325-3999-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this distinction has apparently been lost in modern usage. Most of the eagles used as emblems of various monarchs and states are ''displayed'', including those on the coats of arms of [[Coat of Arms of Germany|Germany]], [[Coat of Arms of Poland|Poland]], [[Coat of Arms of Romania|Romania]], and the [[Great Seal of the United States|United States]].

====Eagle ''volant''====
''Volant'' describes an eagle in profile shown in flight with wings shown ''addorsed'' and ''elevated'' and its legs together and tucked under. It is considered ''in bend'' ("diagonal") as it is flying from the lower ''sinister'' (heraldic left, from the shield-holder's point of view) to the upper ''dexter'' (heraldic right, from the shield-holder's point of view) of the field. However, the term "in bend" is not used unless a ''[[Bend (heraldry)|bend]]'' is actually on the field.

====Eagles ''combatant''====
Like the [[Lion (heraldry)|heraldic lion]], the heraldic eagle is seen as dominating the field and normally cannot brook a rival. When two eagles are depicted on a field, they are usually shown ''combatant'', that is, facing each other with wings spread and one claw extended, as though they were fighting. ''Respectant'', the term used for depicting domestic or game animals shown facing each other, is not used because eagles are aggressive predators.

====Eagles ''addorsed''====
When two eagles are shown back-to-back and facing the edges of the field the term used is ''addorsed'' / ''endorsed'' or ''adossés'' ("back-to-back").

===Variants===

====Eaglet====
This term is used when three or more Eagles are shown on a field. They represent immature Eagles.

====Alerion====
Originally the term ''Erne'' or ''Alerion'' in early Heraldry referred to a regular Eagle. Later heralds used the term ''Alerion'' to depict baby Eagles. To differentiate them from mature Eagles, Alerions were shown as an ''Eagle Displayed Inverted'' without a beak or claws (''disarmed''). To difference it from a ''decapitate'' (headless) eagle, the Alerion has a bulb-shaped head with an eye staring towards the Dexter (right-hand side) of the field. This was later simplified in modern heraldry as an abstract winged oval.

An example is the arms of the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] ([[Or (heraldry)|Or]], on a Bend [[Gules]], 3 Alerions Abaisé [[Argent (heraldry)|Argent]]). It supposedly had been inspired by the assumed arms of crusader [[Geoffrey de Bouillon]], who supposedly killed three white eaglets with a bow and arrow when out hunting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Cadogan Rothery|Rothery, Guy Cadogan]]. ''Concise Encyclopedia of Heraldry''. pp.50&lt;/ref&gt; It is far more likely to be Canting arms that are a pun based on Lorraine / Erne.

===Roman Empire===
[[File:Vexilloid of the Roman Empire.svg|thumb|right|upright|A modern reconstruction of an ''aquila'' on Roman vexilloid.]]
{{main|Aquila (Roman)}}
The ''Aquila'' was the eagle standard of a [[Roman legion]], carried by a special grade [[legionary]] known as an [[Aquilifer]]. One eagle standard was carried by each legion. [[Pliny the Elder]] (''H.N.'' x.16) enumerates five animals displayed on Roman military [[ensign]]s: the [[eagle]], the [[wolf]], the [[minotaur]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]]on the Minotaur.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[horse]], and the [[boar]]. In the second consulship of [[Gaius Marius]] (104 BC) the four quadrupeds were laid aside as standards, the eagle being alone retained. It was made of [[silver]], or [[bronze]], with outstretched wings, but was probably of a relatively small size, since a standard-bearer ([[signifer]]) under [[Julius Caesar]] is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the eagle from its staff and concealed it in the folds of his girdle.&lt;ref&gt;Flor. iv.12&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the later emperors the eagle was carried with the legion, a legion being on that account sometimes called ''aquila'' (Hirt. Bell. Hisp. 30). Each [[Cohort (military unit)|cohort]] had for its own ensign the [[Serpent (symbolism)|serpent]] or [[dragon]], which was woven on a square piece of cloth ''textilis anguis'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Sidonius Apollinaris|Sidon. Apoll.]] ''Carm.'' v.409&lt;/ref&gt; elevated on a [[Gilding|gilt]] staff, to which a cross-bar was adapted for the purpose,&lt;ref&gt;Themist. Orat. i. p1, xviii. p267, ed. Dindorf; Claudian, iv. Cons. Honor. 546; vi. Cons. Honor. 566&lt;/ref&gt; and carried by the ''draconarius''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vegetius|Veget.]] de Re Mil. ii.13; compare [[Tacitus|Tac.]] [[Annals (Tacitus)|Ann.]] [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+1.18 i.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eastern imperial eagles===
[[File:Byzantine eagle.JPG|thumb|left|[[Double-headed eagle]] emblem of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The head on the left (West) symbolizes [[Rome]], the head on the right (East) symbolizes [[Constantinople]].  Relief from the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]])]]
The [[double-headed eagle]] became the symbol of the Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]]. Palaiologos recaptured Constantinople from the Crusaders in 1261 and adopted the [[double-headed eagle]] as his symbol of the dynasty's interests in both Asia and Europe. It represented looking towards the East (Asia Minor, traditional power center of the Byzantine-government in exile after the [[Fourth Crusade|IVth Crusade]]) and the West (newly reconquered land in Europe) centered on [[Constantinople]]. The [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]] has been seen in late 13th century, certainly pre-dating the development of the same in western heraldry.

In [[Russia]] it was [[Ivan III of Russia]] who first assumed the [[Coat of arms of Russia|two-headed eagle]], when, in 1472, he married [[Sophia Paleologue|Sophia]], daughter of [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas Palæologus]], and niece of [[Constantine XI]], the last Emperor of Byzantium. The two heads symbolised the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern or Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Western Roman Empire|Western or Roman Empire]].

The [[Empire of Trebizond]] (1204–1461), one of the states created after the capture of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade, used the emblem of the normal (single headed) eagle. The black eagle on yellow background is still used today in Greece by descendants of [[Pontus (region)|Pontian]] Greeks.&lt;ref name="Kokkonis"&gt;{{cite book | title=Greek flags, arms and insignia (Ελληνικές Σημαίες, Σήματα-Εμβλήματα) | language=greek | author=Eleni Kokkonis-Lambropoulos &amp; Katerina Korres-Zografos | year=1997 | publisher=E.

===Holy Roman Empire===
{{main|Reichsadler}}
[[File:Heiliges Römisches Reich - Reichssturmfahne vor 1433 (Nimbierter Adler).svg|thumb|right|Reconstruction of the pre-1433 Holy Roman Emperor's "imperial eagle" flag.]]
&lt;!-- [[Charlemagne]] was a Frankish ruler and the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]] from AD 800 - 814, in days when no '[[France]]' or '[[Germany]]' existed. He had the statue of a black eagle with single head placed on top of his palace in [[Aachen]]. A frequently encountered misquote, mostly by copy circulation on the world wide web is “When Charlemagne was made 'Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire', he joined the two heads together, one looking east and the other west, thus symbolizing the union of these two powers.” There is no printed or built genuine material left from his time showing any evidence of his use of a [[double-headed eagle]] as his coat of arms. A [[stained glass]] artwork found in a later period church reflects the adaptation of his symbols as artists’ representation expressed much later than Charlemagne’s reign, showing half of the body of a single-head black eagle as the symbol of the German emperors next to a [[fleur-de-lis]] as the symbol of the kings of France in two halves of a shield, as the sign of dichotomy of his reign, and that is not considered a chronologically accurate evidence that he might indeed have used a [[double-headed eagle]] as his crest at his time, see [http://www.charlemagne.net here]. --&gt;

[[Charlemagne]], a Frankish ruler and the first [[Holy Roman Emperor]], died in 814, centuries before the introduction of [[heraldry]]. In later periods, a coat of arms [[attributed arms|attributed]] to Charlemagne shows half of the body of a single-head black eagle as the symbol of the German emperors next to a [[fleur-de-lis]] as the symbol of the kings of France on an [[Impalement (heraldry)|impaled]] shield.

According to [[Carl-Alexander von Volborth]] the first instance of the use of an eagle as an heraldic charge is the Great Seal of the [[Margrave]] [[Leopold IV of Austria (Babenberg)|Leopold IV of Austria]] in 1136, which depicts him carrying a shield charged with an eagle. Also from about this time is a coin showing a single-headed eagle,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngw.nl/int/dld/duitslan.htm Deutsche Wappen - GERMAN NATIONAL ARMS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; minted in [[Maastricht]] (the [[Netherlands]]), dating from between 1172 and 1190 after contacts with the East via the Crusades.  One [[L'Aigle family|Gilbert d'Aquila]] was granted Baronetcy of Pevensey by William the Conqueror. The family who held Pevensey castle and the newly formed Borough of Pevensey used the eagle symbol in the 11th century.

From the reign of [[Frederick Barbarossa]] in 1155 the single-headed eagle became a symbol of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The eagle was clearly derived from the Roman eagle and continues to be important in the heraldry of those areas once within the Holy Roman Empire. Within Germany the placement of one's arms in front of an eagle was indicative of princely rank under the Holy Roman Empire. The first mention of a [[double-headed eagle]] in the West dates from 1250 in a roll of arms of [[Matthew Paris]] for Emperor [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]].

===French Empire===
[[File:Imperial Coat of Arms of France (1804-1815).svg|thumb|left|190px|[[National emblem of France|Coat of arms]] of the [[First French Empire]]]]
{{main|French Imperial Eagle}}
The French Imperial Eagle or ''Aigle de drapeau'' (lit. "flag eagle") was a figure of an eagle on a staff carried into battle as a standard by the [[Grande Armée]] of [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon I]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

Although they were presented with [[Regimental Colour]]s, the regiments of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon I]] tended to carry at their head the '''Imperial Eagle'''. This was the [[bronze]] sculpture of an [[eagle]] weighing {{convert|1.85|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, mounted on top of the blue regimental flagpole. They were made from six separately cast pieces and, when assembled, measured {{convert|310|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and {{convert|255|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in width. On the base would be the regiment's number or, in the case of the [[Imperial Guard|Guard]], '''Garde Impériale'''. The eagle bore the same significance to French Imperial regiments as the colours did to [[British Army|British]] regiments - to lose the eagle would bring shame to the regiment, who had pledged to defend it to the death.

Upon Napoleon's fall, the restored monarchy of [[Louis XVIII of France]] ordered all eagles to be destroyed and only a very small number escaped. When the former emperor returned to power in 1815 (known as the [[Hundred Days]]) he immediately had more eagles produced, although the quality did not match the originals. The workmanship was of a lesser quality and the main distinguishing changes had the new models with closed beaks and they were set in a more crouched posture.

Napoleon also used the French Imperial Eagle in the [[National Emblem of France|heraldry]] of the [[First French Empire|First Empire]], as did his nephew [[Napoleon III]] during the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]]. An eagle remains in the arms of the [[House of Bonaparte]] and the [[House of Bernadotte|current royal house of Sweden]] retains the French Imperial Eagle on its [[inescutcheon|dynastic inescutcheon]], as his founder, [[Jean Bernadotte]], was a [[Marshal of France]].

== Eagle of Saint John ==
[[File:VA23Oct10 096-crop.jpg|thumb|200px|Carolingian ivory plaque with the eagle of Saint John, showing the customary halo, Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]]
[[John the Evangelist]], the author of the [[Gospel according to John|fourth gospel]] account, is symbolized by an [[eagle]], often with a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], an animal may have originally been seen as the king of the birds. The eagle is a figure of the sky, and believed by Christian scholars to be able to look straight into the sun.&lt;ref&gt;Emile Male, ''The Gothic Image: Religious Art in France of the Thirteenth Century'', p 35–7, English trans. of 3rd edn, 1913, Collins, London (and many other editions), {{ISBN|978-0064300322}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The better known heraldic use of the Eagle of St. John has been the single supporter chose by [[Isabella I of Castile|Queen Isabella of Castile]] in her armorial achievement used as heiress and later integrated into the [[Coat of Arms of Spain#Historical Spanish coats of arms|heraldry]] of the [[Catholic Monarchs]].

The Eagle of St. John was placed on side of the shields used as English consort by [[Catherine of Aragon]], daughter of the Catholic Monarchs, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]] and [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip]] as English monarchs. In Spain, Philip bore the Eagle of St John (single or two figures depending versions) in his [[Coat of arms of the King of Spain#Ornamented versions of the historical royal coats of arms|ornamented armorial achievements]] until 1668.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Olmos, José María de.

===United Kingdom===
An eagle is present on the official emblem of the [[Royal Air Force]].

===United States===
Since 20 June 1782, the [[United States]] has used its [[List of national birds|national bird]], the [[bald eagle]], on its [[Great Seal of the United States|Great Seal]]; the choice was intended to at once recall the [[Roman Republic]] and be uniquely American (the bald eagle being indigenous to North America). The American Eagle has been a popular emblem throughout the life of the republic, with an eagle appearing in its current form [[:File:USGreatSealGrahamLithograph.jpg|since 1885]], in the flags and seals of the [[:File:Flag of the President of the United States of America.svg|President]], [[:File:USNavyFlag-Official.svg|Navy]], [[:File:Marine corps flag.svg|Marine Corps]], [[:File:Flag of the United States Air Force.png|Air Force]], [[:File:US-DeptOfJustice-Seal.svg|Justice Department]], [[:File:United States Department of Defense Seal.svg|Defense Department]], [[:File:Uspslogo.png|Postal Service]], and other organizations, on various coins (such as the [[:File:COBREcentavosecuador2000-2.gif|quarter dollar]]), and in various American corporate logos past and present, such as those of [[:File:Old Abe Case mascot.JPG|Case]] and [[:File:American Eagle Outfitters logo.svg|American Eagle Outfitters]].

===Costa Rica===
It is used in the [[Imperial (beer)|Imperial]] beer logo.

===Arab countries===
{{main|Eagle of Saladin}}

In [[Arab nationalism]], with the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], the eagle became the symbol of revolutionary [[Egypt]], and was subsequently adopted by several other Arab states (the [[Coat of arms of the United Arab Emirates|United Arab Emirates]], [[Coat of arms of Iraq|Iraq]], [[Coat of arms of Libya#Libya under Gaddafi|Libya]], the partially recognised [[Coat of arms of Palestine|State of Palestine]], and [[Coat of arms of Yemen|Yemen]]).

The eagle as a symbol of [[Saladin]] is disputed by archaeologists. The symbol of an eagle was found on the west wall of the [[Cairo Citadel]] (constructed by Saladin), and so is assumed by many to be his personal symbol. There is, however, little proof to defend this.

As a [[heraldry|heraldic]] symbol identified with Arab nationalism, the Eagle of Saladin was subsequently adopted as the coats of arms of [[Coat of arms of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[Coat of arms of Palestine|Palestine]]. It has previously been the coat of arms of [[Coat of arms of Libya|Libya]], but later replaced by the [[Hawk of Quraish]]. The Hawk of Quraish was itself abandoned after the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]]. The Eagle of Saladin was part of the coat of arms of [[Coat of arms of South Yemen|South Yemen]] prior to that country's [[Yemeni unification|unification]] with [[North Yemen]].

'''''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls: How the Sex-Drugs-and-Rock 'N Roll Generation Saved Hollywood''''' is a book written by [[Peter Biskind]] and published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1998. ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' is about the [[New Hollywood|1970s Hollywood]], a period of American film known for the production of such films such as ''[[The Godfather]],'' ''[[The Godfather Part II]],'' ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]],'' ''[[Taxi Driver]],'' ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]],'' ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]],'' ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]],'' and ''[[The Last Picture Show]]''. The title is taken from films which bookend the era: ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980). The book follows Hollywood on the brink of the [[Vietnam War]], when a group of young Hollywood film directors known as the "movie brats" are making their names. It begins in the 1960s and ends in the 1980s.

The book was the basis of a 2003 documentary film of the same name directed by Kenneth Bowser and narrated by actor [[William H. Macy]]. It was screened out of competition at the [[2003 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4090051/year/2003.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Easy Riders, Raging Bulls |accessdate=2009-11-08|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a score of 100% based on reviews from 8 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/easy_riders_raging_bulls/|title=Easy Riders---Raging Bulls|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy and criticism==
Several of the film-makers profiled in the book have criticized Biskind. Robert Altman denounced both the book and Biskind's methods, saying "It was hate mail. We were all lured into talking to this guy because people thought he was a straight guy but he was filling a commission from the publisher for a hatchet job. He's the worst kind of human being I know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Full exposure | author = Tim Adams | work = [[The Observer]] | date = 22 August 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/22/film1 | archivedate = 2013-12-03 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203134613/http://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/aug/22/film1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Francis Ford Coppola was similarly critical, alleging that Biskind interviewed only people with negative opinions of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=‘Easy Riders, Raging Bulls’ Author Peter Biskind Looks Back at the New Hollywood |author=Susan Wloszczyna |work=[[IndieWire]] |date=July 18, 2014 |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2014/07/easy-riders-raging-bulls-author-peter-biskind-looks-back-at-the-new-hollywood-191482/ |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic [[Roger Ebert]] noted that Steven Spielberg said of ''Easy Riders, Raging Bulls'' that: "Every single word in that book about me is either erroneous or a lie."&lt;ref name="Ebert"&gt;{{cite web| title=TINSELTOWN AUTHOR GETS 'DOWN AND DIRTY,' INDEED |author=[[Roger Ebert]] |work=Rogerebert.com |date=February 22, 2004 |url=http://www.rogerebert.com/answer-man/tinseltown-author-gets-down-and-dirty-indeed |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert himself notes that: "Biskind has a way of massaging his stories to suit his agenda."&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt; When asked about Biskind's portrayal of him as "a womanizer, a tyrant and a bully," William Friedkin said: "I've actually never read the book, but I've talked to some of my friends who are portrayed in it, and we all share the opinion that it is partial truth, partial myth and partial out-and-out lies by mostly rejected girlfriends and wives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=The Exorcist Director William Friedkin Tells All in His No-Bullshit Memoir |author=Paul Teetor |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=April 11, 2013 |url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/the-exorcist-director-william-friedkin-tells-all-in-his-no-bullshit-memoir-4184306 |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Bogdanovich was equally furious, saying: "I spent seven hours with that guy over a period of days, and he got it all wrong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Bogdanovich Epilogue: A Word About Biskind And Cher |author=David Poland |work=Movie City News |date=February 14, 2006 |url=http://moviecitynews.com/2006/02/bogdanovich-epilogue-a-word-about-biskind-and-cher/ |accessdate=August 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Epigram of Amazaspos''' ({{lang-ka|ამაზასპის ეპიგრამა}}) is a [[funerary text|funerary]] [[epigram]] written in [[Ancient Greek]] on an inscription found in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; It [[Memorialization|memorialises]] the [[death]] of the [[Pharnavazid dynasty|Pharnavazid]]&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; royal prince Amazaspos, brother of kings [[Mihrdat I of Iberia|Mihrdat I]] and [[Rhadamistus]], son of king [[Pharasmanes I of Iberia]], who died at [[Nusaybin|Nisibis]] while accompanying the emperor [[Trajan]] on his Parthian expedition during the [[Roman–Parthian Wars]].&lt;ref name="Rapp"&gt;Rapp, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Sydney, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

The epigram seems to be a work of some ''[[litterateur]]'' in emperor Trajan's company during his Parthian expedition and it seems he was personally aware of Amazaspos' charms where he is compared to "modest maidens". It is suggested that this poet may have been emperor [[Hadrian]] himself. Authorship of the epigram for prince Amazaspos by Hadrian would explain how the text was available to be inscribed in [[Rome]] as the stone may have been erected there in a public place during Hadrian's reign as a reminder of the cost to the [[Roman Empire]] of its policy of expansion as Hadrian quickly gave up almost all the lands Trajan had conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Chaniotis, Corsten, Stroud &amp; Tybout, p. 335&lt;/ref&gt; Presumably the prince's remains had also been transferred by Hadrian to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Braund, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription is dated 114-117 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Chaniotis, Corsten, Stroud &amp; Tybout, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt; Amazaspos is also mentioned in [[Armazi stele of Vespasian]],&lt;ref name="Rapp"/&gt; though according to [[Cyril Toumanoff]] that Amazaspos is King [[Amazasp I of Iberia]].&lt;ref&gt;Toumanoff, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Faris Odeh''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;فارس عودة&lt;/big&gt;}}, December 1985 – 8 November 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Agence France-Presse |date=November 8, 2000 |title=Three Palestinians, one Israeli dead as violence continues}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] boy shot dead by the [[Israel Defense Forces]] near the [[Karni crossing]] in the [[Gaza Strip]] while [[Palestinian stone-throwing|throwing stones]] in the second month of the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]].

A picture of Odeh standing alone in front of a tank, with a stone in his hand and arm bent back to throw it, was taken by a [[photojournalist]] from the [[Associated Press]] on 29 October 2000. Ten days later, on 8 November, Odeh was again throwing stones at Karni when he was shot in the neck by Israeli troops. The boy and the image subsequently assumed [[icon]]ic status within the [[Palestinian territories]] as a symbol of opposition to the area's [[Israeli-occupied territories|occupation by Israel]].&lt;ref name=Hanley&gt;{{cite web|title=Israel's Spin-Doctors Wage War of Images and Words Against Palestinian Rock Children|author=Delinda Curtiss Hanley|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=January–February 2001|accessdate=2007-07-16|url=http://www.wrmea.com/backissues/010201/0101021.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=laguardia /&gt;

==Biography==
Odeh was born in the [[Zeitoun, Gaza|Zeitoun]] quarter of [[Gaza City]], where he lived his entire life with his parents Fayek and Anam and his eight brothers and sisters. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Odeh was an "adolescent daredevil". He was fond of risky stunts, and once jumped an eight-foot gap between the roofs of two four-story buildings.&lt;ref name=post&gt;{{cite news|last=Hockstader|first=Lee|work=The Washington Post|date=2000-12-11|page=A18|title=Gaza Gains a Martyr, Parents Lose a Son; Slain Youth Hailed As Palestinian Hero While Couple Mourns|accessdate=2007-07-23|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2000/12/11/gaza-gains-a-martyr-parents-lose-a-son/6e0ee67b-0b33-4b60-a857-bc2986ac4d21/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Al-Aqsa Intifada]] began in September 2000, Odeh started skipping school to participate in the action, either at the Karni crossing or the Israeli settlement of [[Netzarim (settlement)|Netzarim]].&lt;ref name=post /&gt;&lt;ref name=upi&gt;{{cite news|last=Abu Ramadan|first=Saud|date=2000-12-20|publisher=United Press International|title=The death of a 14-year-old "martyr"}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headmaster of Odeh's school complained about the boy's absences to his parents who tried, unsuccessfully, to keep him away from the conflict. According to Faris' mother, the boy's father "beat him black and blue for throwing stones." Fayek also tried to physically restrain his son. Once he locked the boy in his room, but Faris escaped out the window. According to the ''Post'', "The next time Fayek heard that Faris had been at a clash point, he got tougher; he tied the boy's hands and feet together and left him on the roof after dinner. By midnight, his mother, worried sick about the boy, sneaked up to the roof and freed him."&lt;ref name = post/&gt;

Still, Faris was undeterred.&lt;ref name=post /&gt; His mother Anam would repeatedly go to the sites of the worst fighting in search of her son, often finding him at the front of the crowd, nearest the Israeli troops. "I must have gone out looking for him 50 times," she was quoted as saying in ''The Washington Post''. "One day, I went out three times. Sometimes I'd sit down to lunch, and before I could put the first bite in my mouth some kids would come by and tell me Faris was at Karni again, throwing stones. And I'd drop my fork and rush out to find him."&lt;ref name=post /&gt;

"It wasn't the fame he loved," she continued. "In fact, he was afraid that if he was filmed on TV his father would see him, so he'd run away from the cameras. One day, after I'd gone and dragged him away from the clashes every day for a week, I told him: 'Okay, you want to throw stones? Fine. But at least hide behind something! Why do you have to be at the very front, even farther up than the older kids?' And he said, 'I'm not afraid.'"&lt;ref name=post /&gt;

On October 29, [[Associated Press]] photographer Laurent Rebours captured the iconic photo of Odeh, who, according to a subsequent AP story, "reveled in his role as the most famous rock-hurler" at Karni.&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Associated Press|last=Myre|first=Greg|date=2000-11-25|title=Mideast moms face deadly dilemma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Odeh's 17-year-old cousin Shadi, a Palestinian policeman, was killed during a confrontation with Israeli troops on 1 November. "When that happened, Faris said, 'I swear I'll avenge his death,'" Anam Odeh told the ''Post''. "He went to Shadi's funeral wreath and placed a snapshot of himself in it. He said the wreath would be for him, too."&lt;ref name=post /&gt;&lt;ref name=ap /&gt;

==Death==
Odeh was reportedly at the front of a group of young Palestinians [[Palestinian stone-throwing|throwing rocks]] at Israeli troops at the Karni crossing, when Israeli soldiers opened fire. His friends say that as Odeh crouched to pick up a stone, he was hit in the neck and that because he was so close to an Israeli tank that they had to wait an hour before they felt it was safe to remove his body and load it into an ambulance. He was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital.&lt;ref name=post /&gt;&lt;ref name=upi /&gt;&lt;ref name=ap /&gt;

===Reaction===
According to [[United Press International]] (UPI), tens of thousands of people attended Odeh's funeral.&lt;ref name=upi /&gt; His father told UPI: "He is a martyr, and this is what he always wanted to be, a martyr for the sake of Al Aqsa."&lt;ref name=upi /&gt; Like all Palestinian families who had a member killed by Israeli troops after the outbreak of the [[Second Intifada]], the Odehs received a $10,000 cheque from [[Iraq]]'s then president [[Saddam Hussein]] {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. His mother remarked that, "Faris was a boy who loved me so much [...] His blood is worth so much more."&lt;ref name=post /&gt;

Since his death, Odeh and his image have become iconic.&lt;ref name=laguardia&gt;{{cite book|last=La Guardia|first=Anton |title=War without End: Israelis, Palestinians, and the Struggle for a Promised Land|publisher=Macmillan|year=2003|pages=264|isbn=978-0-312-31633-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EEDYWgq6WCMC&amp;pg=PA264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dubbed the "Palestinian everyman"&lt;ref name=Valier&gt;{{cite journal|title=The sense of atrocity and the passion for justice|author=Claire Valier|journal=Critical Review of International Social and Political Philosophy|volume=7|issue=2|date=Summer 2004|pages=145–159|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a713634746~db=all|doi=10.1080/1369823042000266567}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "poster boy of Palestinian defiance," for many Palestinians he is a hero, portrayed in graffiti, wall art, calendars and posters.&lt;ref name=post/&gt; In 2001, his [[slingshot]] appeared in an exhibit called "100 Martyrs – 100 Lives" at the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center in [[Ramallah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sontag|first=Deborah|page=Section A Pg. 4|date=2001-02-21|accessdate=2007-07-23|work=The New York Times|title=Ramallah Journal; Bitter, Stark Souvenirs: Sneakers and Slingshots|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E2D61639F932A15751C0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was praised by [[Yasser Arafat]] in February 2002.&lt;ref name=Daraghmeh&gt;{{cite news |title=Palestinian Youths Support Dead Bomber |author=Mohammed Daraghmeh |work=The Washington Post |date=2002-02-19 |url=http://www.unitedjerusalem.org/index2.asp?id=79224&amp;Date=2/20/2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716233207/http://www.unitedjerusalem.org/index2.asp?id=79224&amp;Date=2%2F20%2F2002 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Faris Odeh activism award has been created in his name, granted annually by [[Al-Awda]]: The Palestine Right to Return Coalition (PRCC).

UPI's photo changed Israeli tank doctrine. In August 2001 ''The Jerusalem Post'' quoted an anonymous tank doctrinist saying tank personnel were now instructed to fire upon rock-throwers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O’Sullivan|first1=Arieh|title=The Army Banks On Its Tanks |url=http://www.benning.army.mil/armor/eARMOR/content/issues/2001/NOV_DEC/ArmorNovemberDecember2001webWithList.pdf|accessdate=10 April 2017|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=15 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Palestinian ''shabab'' (youth) were immortalized by the televised footage on them throwing stones at Israeli tanks during the [[Second Intifada]], according to [[Barbara A. Goldscheider]], who cites Faris Odeh and [[Mohammed Al-Durrah]] as examples of two 12-year-old Palestinian boys who became instant martrys.&lt;ref name=Goldscheiderp18&gt;Goldscheider, 2005, [https://books.google.com/books?id=M9c5lnHYApYC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=faris+odeh#v=onepage&amp;q=faris%20odeh&amp;f=false p. 18].&lt;/ref&gt; 

To French philosopher [[Pierre-André Taguieff]], the Palestinian response to Odeh's death forms part of a popular political religion revolving around the figure of the ''[[Martyrdom in Islam|shahid]]'', or martyr. He views this as a consequence of the "[[Islam]]ization" of the Palestinian cause, manifested in Palestinian support for a "culture of death."&lt;ref name=Taguieff/&gt; Odeh's mother told reporters that he used to watch [[Felesteen-Al-Yawm]], the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]] television channel, where the idea of becoming a martyr is highly regarded. "He wanted to join them," she said, "and used to wear their headband."&lt;ref name=Taguieff /&gt; 

Dr Eyad al-Sarraj, founder and director of the Gaza Community Mental Health Programme, writes that stone-throwing during the Intifada was one of the few distractions the children had. They did not realize the danger they were in, he said, and felt invincible.&lt;ref name=Taguieff&gt;Taguieff, 2004, p. 65, 163 (footnote #18) For the comments of Odeh's mother and Dr Eyad al-Sarraj, Taguieff cites Claudet, Sophie. "Mourir en martyr," ''Revue d'études palestiniennes'', new series, No. 28, Summer 2001, pp. 96–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Film criticism''' is the analysis and evaluation of [[film]]s and the film medium. The concept is often used interchangeably with that of film reviews. A film review implies a recommendation aimed at consumers, however not all film criticism takes the form of reviews.

In general, film criticism can be divided into two categories: journalistic criticism which appears regularly in [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s and other popular mass-media outlets; and academic criticism by [[film scholar]]s who are informed by [[film theory]] and are published in academic journals. Academic film criticism rarely takes the form of a review; instead it is more likely to analyse the film and its place within the history of its genre, or the whole of [[History of film|film history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://researchguides.uvm.edu/c.php?g=290200&amp;p=3481769|title=Reviews vs Criticism - Film &amp; Television Studies|last=|first=|date=October 15, 2017|website=The University of Vermont Libraries Research Guides|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Film was introduced in the late 19th century. The earliest artistic criticism of film emerged in the early 1900s. The first paper to serve as a critique of film came out of ''The Optical Lantern and Cinematograph Journal,'' followed by the ''Bioscope'' in 1908.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Battaglia|first=James|date=May 2010|title=Everyone's a Critic: Film Criticism Through History and Into the Digital Age|url=http://digitalcommons.brockport.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1031&amp;context=honors|journal=Senior Honors Theses|volume=|pages=32|via=Digital Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film is a relatively new form of art, in comparison to [[music]], [[literature]] and [[painting]] which have existed since ancient times. Because of this, early writing on film sought to argue that films could also be respected as art. In 1911, [[Ricciotto Canudo]] wrote a manifesto proclaiming cinema to be the "Sixth Art" (later "Seventh Art").&lt;ref&gt;Giovanni Dotoli, ''Ricciotto Canudo ou le cinéma comme art'', Preface by Jean-Louis Leutrat, Fasano-Paris, Schena-Didier Érudition, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; For many decades after, film was still being treated with less prestige than longer-established art forms.&lt;ref name="kilkenny"/&gt;

By the 1920s, critics were analyzing film for its merit and value as more than just entertainment. The growing popularity of the medium caused major newspapers to start hiring film critics.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; In the 1930s, the film industry developed [[Movie star|concepts of stardom]] and celebrity in relation to actors, which led to a rise in obsession with critics as well, to the point that they were often seen on "[[red carpet]]" and at major events with the actors.

It was in the 1940s that new forms of criticism emerged. Essays analyzing films with a distinctive charm and style to persuade the reader of the critic's argument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was the emergence of these styles that brought film criticism to the mainstream, gaining the attention of many popular magazines; this made film reviews and critiques an eventual staple among most print media. As the decades passed, the fame for critics grew and gave rise to household names among the craft like [[James Agee]], [[Andrew Sarris]], [[Pauline Kael]] and in modern times [[Roger Ebert]] and [[Peter Travers]].

== Journalistic criticism ==
Film [[critic]]s working for [[newspaper]]s, [[magazine]]s, [[broadcast media]], and online publications, mainly review new releases, although also review older films.&lt;ref name="Classics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/atthemovies/classic/|title=The Classic|work=At the Movies with Margaret and David|publisher=ABC.net.au|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important task for these reviews is to inform readers on whether or not they would want to see the film. A film review will typically explain the [[Premise (filmmaking)|premise]] of the film before discussing its merits. The verdict is often summarised with a form of rating. Numerous rating systems exist, such as [[Star rating#Films|5- or 4-star scales]], academic-style grades and pictograms (such as in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'').

[[File:Russ_Meyer_and_Roger_Ebert_by_Roger_Ebert.jpg|right|thumb|264x264px|Chicago critic Roger Ebert (R) with director [[Russ Meyer]].]]
Some well-known journalistic critics have included: [[James Agee]] (''Time'' (magazine), ''The Nation''); [[Vincent Canby]] (''The New York Times''); [[Roger Ebert]] (''Chicago Sun-Times''); [[Mark Kermode]] (''BBC'', ''The Observer''); [[James Berardinelli]]; [[Philip French]] (''The Observer''); [[Pauline Kael]] (''The New Yorker''); [[Manny Farber]] (''The New Republic'', ''Time'', ''The Nation''); [[Peter Bradshaw]] (''The Guardian''); [[Michael Phillips (critic)|Michael Phillips]] (''Chicago Tribune''); [[Andrew Sarris]] (''The Village Voice''); [[Joel Siegel]] (''Good Morning America''); [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] (''Chicago Reader''); and [[Christy Lemire]] (''What The Flick?!'').

[[Roger Ebert]] and [[Gene Siskel]] popularised the concept of reviewing films in a television format in the show ''[[At the Movies (1986 TV program)|Siskel &amp; Ebert At the Movies]]'' which became syndicated in the 1980s. Both critics had established their careers in print media, and continued to write written reviews for their respective newspapers alongside their television show.

== Online film criticism ==
===Aggregators===
Some websites, such as [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and [[Metacritic]], seek to improve the usefulness of film reviews by compiling them and assigning a score to each in order to gauge the general reception a film receives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2011/06/slates_hollywood_careeromatic.html|title=Slate's Hollywood Career-O-Matic|last=Beam|first=Christopher|date=2011-06-06|work=Slate|access-date=2017-10-25|last2=Singer-Vine|first2=Jeremy|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Online film critics===
[[Blogging]] has also introduced opportunities for a new wave of amateur film critics to have their opinions heard. These review blogs may focus on one genre, director or actor, or encompass a much wider variety of films. Friends, friends of friends, or strangers are able to visit these blogsites, and can often leave their own comments about the movie and/or the author's review. Although much less frequented than their professional counterparts, these sites can gather a following of like-minded people who look to specific bloggers for reviews as they have found that the critic consistently exhibits an outlook very similar to their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thebalance.com/blogging-what-is-it-1794405|title=What is blogging?|work=The Balance|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[YouTube]] has also served as a platform for amateur film critics.

Some websites specialize in narrow aspects of film reviewing. For instance, there are sites that focus on specific content advisories for parents to judge a film's suitability for children. Others focus on a religious perspective (e.g. CAP Alert). Still others highlight more esoteric subjects such as the depiction of [[science]] in fiction films. One such example is ''Insultingly Stupid Movie Physics'' by [[Intuitor]]. Some online niche websites provide comprehensive coverage of the independent sector; usually adopting a style closer to print journalism. They tend to prohibit adverts and offer uncompromising opinions free of any commercial interest. Their film critics normally have an academic film background.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Online Film Critics Society]], an international professional association of Internet-based cinema reviewers, consists of writers from all over the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ofcs.org/bylaws-of-the-online-film-critics-society/|title=Our Bylaws – Online Film Critics Society|website=ofcs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[New York Film Critics Online]] members handle reviews in the New York tri-state area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nyfco.net/who-we-are/|title=New York Film Critics Online - Who We Are|website=www.nyfco.net|language=en|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User-submitted reviews===
A number of websites allow Internet users to submit movie reviews and aggregate them into an average. Community-driven review sites have allowed the common movie goer to express their opinion on films. Many of these sites allow users to rate films on a 0 to 10 scale, while some rely on the star rating system of 1–5, 0–5 or 0–4 stars. The votes are then culled into an overall rating and ranking for any particular film. Some of these community driven review sites include Reviewer, Movie Attractions, [[Flixster]], [[FilmCrave]], [[Flickchart]] and [[Everyone's a Critic]]. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and [[Metacritic]] aggregate both scores from accredited critics and those submitted by users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/about/|title=Rotten Tomatoes: About|website=www.rottentomatoes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On these online review sites, users generally only have to register with the site in order to submit reviews. This means that they are a form of [[open access poll]], and have the same advantages and disadvantages; notably, there is no guarantee that they will be a representative sample of the film's audience. In some cases, online review sites have produced wildly differing results to scientific polling of audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/12/star-wars-the-last-jedi-rotten-tomatoes-metacritic-imdb-users-cinemascore-posttrak-1202228837/|title=Did Audiences Enjoy ‘Star Wars: The Last Jedi’? Deciphering Online User Reviews From Exit Polls|last=D'Alessandro|first=Anthony|date=2017-12-17|work=Deadline|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taste-based reviews ===
The  emerging big data science has enabled computing to understand user's taste from reviews and connect them with similar users so that networked Tribe can be a great source of recommendations.  Most review aggregators indirectly influence the herd mentality in us while critic reviewers are just one opinion among many. CineBee, a machine learning based approach to reviews and opinions, helps isolate user's taste from their reviews and connects similar users. As these Tribes are formed, CineBee uses the Tribe intelligence to provide recommendation, prediction and discovery to its users.  

== Academic film criticism ==
More often known as [[film theory]] or [[film studies]], academic critique explores cinema beyond journalistic film reviews. These film critics try to examine why film works, how it works aesthetically or politically, what it means, and what effects it has on people. Rather than write for mass-market publications their articles are usually published in scholarly journals and texts which tend to be affiliated with university presses; or sometimes in up-market magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.ufl.edu/english/faculty/publications_nz.html#ray|title=Faculty publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most academic criticism of film often follows a similar format. They usually include summaries of the plot of the film to either refresh the plot to the reader, or reinforce an idea of repetition in the film's genre. After this, there tends to be discussions about the cultural context, major themes and repetitions, and details about the legacy of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hantke|first=Steffen|date=2007|title=Academic Film Criticism, the Rhetoric of Crisis, and the Current State of American Horror Cinema: Thoughts on Canonicity and Academic Anxiety|jstor=25115464|journal=College Literature|volume=34|issue=4|pages=191–202|doi=10.2307/25115464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable academic film critics include [[André Bazin]], [[Jean-Luc Godard]] and [[François Truffaut]] (all writers for ''[[Cahiers du Cinéma]]''); [[Kristin Thompson]], [[David Bordwell]], and [[Sergei Eisenstein]]. Godard, Truffaut and Eisenstein were also film directors.

==Issues and controversies==
===Influence===
In the 2000s, the effect that reviews have on a film's [[box office]] performance and DVD rentals/sales have become a matter for debate. Some analysts argue that modern [[movie marketing]], using pop culture convention appearances (e.g., [[Comicon]]) and [[social media]] along with traditional means of advertising, has led, in part, to a decline in the readership of many reviewers for newspapers and other print publications. There are fewer critics on television and radio in the last thirty years.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

However, in recent years, there has been a growing belief in the film industry that critic aggregators (especially [[Rotten Tomatoes]]) are increasing the collective influence of film critics. The underperformance of several films in 2017 was blamed on their low scores on Rotten Tomatoes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2017/06/13/box-office-rotten-tomatoes-netflix-and-a-perfect-storm-dooms-hollywood/#6704f0f43a61|title=Rotten Tomatoes, Netflix And A Perfect Storm That Dooms Hollywood|last1=Mendelson|first1=Scott|date=13 June 2017|accessdate=14 June 2017|publisher=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to studies such as one commissioned by [[20th Century Fox]] claiming that younger viewers give the website more credibility than the major studio [[Movie marketing|marketing]], which undercuts its effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/06/how-hollywood-came-to-fear-and-loathe-rotten-tomatoes|title=How Hollywood Came to Fear and Loathe Rotten Tomatoes|last1=Lee|first1=Chris|date=9 June 2017|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, fan-run film analysis websites like [[Box Office Prophets]], [[CineBee]] and Box Office Guru routinely factor more into the opinions of the general public on films produced.

===  The "undulating curve of shifting expectations" ===
The "undulating curve of shifting expectations" (UCoSE) refers to both the title of a recurring entertainment industry feature in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine by cultural critic [[Adam Sternbergh]] and also to a concept of media analysis co-developed by writer [[Emily Nussbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/212516-when-it-ok-spoil/|title=When Is It OK to Spoil?|work=[[On the Media]]|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/the-mathemagical-world-of-new-york-magazine_b1149|title=The Mathemagical World of New York Magazine|publisher=mediabistro.com|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCoSE refers to the dynamic tension between pre-release promotional efforts and subsequent audience reactions to entertainment media.&lt;blockquote&gt;…what the UCoSE does is provide us a way of analyzing the trajectory of entertainment products as they metamorphize their way through his theorized seven-stage growth chart: Pre-Buzz, Buzz, Rave Reviews, Saturation Point, Overhyped, Backlash, and finally, Backlash To The Backlash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/music/tuner/2012-01-19/whitney-cummings-the-television-industrys-most-criticized-female-comes-out-in-support-of-lana-del-rey-the-music-industrys-most-criticized-female/|title=Whitney Cummings, The Television Industry’s Most Criticized Female, Comes Out In Support Of Lana Del Rey, The Music Industry’s Most Criticized Female|publisher=VH1 Music News|accessdate=2 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Female representation ===
There have been many complaints against the film-criticism industry for its underrepresentation of women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/spotlight/lack-of-women-film-criticism-1201667282/|title=The Curious Case of the Missing Women in Film Criticism|last=Adams|first=Thelma|date=2015-12-29|work=Variety|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the top critics on Rotten Tomatoes shows that 91 per cent of writers for movie/entertainment magazines and websites are men, as are 90 per cent of those for trade publications, 80 per cent of critics for general interest magazines like [[Time (magazine)|Time]], and 70 per cent of reviewers for radio formats such as [[NPR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2016/06/23/film-criticism-gender-study/|title=Male film critics greatly outnumber female critics, study finds|date=2016-06-23|work=EW.com|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', Kate Kilkenny argued that women were better represented in film criticism before the rise of the Internet. In the past, when film was considered less prestigious than visual art and literature, it was easier for women to break into film criticism. [[Judith Crist]] and [[Pauline Kael]] were two of the most influential film critics of the 1960s and 1970s. The Internet led to a decline in jobs at small newspapers where women were more likely to review films, whereas the more male-dominated jobs at major newspapers survived better. The Internet also encouraged a growth in niche review websites that were even more male-dominated than older media. Kilkenny also suggested that the shortage of female critics was related to the shortage of female opinion columnists.&lt;ref name="kilkenny"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/12/female-film-critics/421629/|publisher=The Atlantic|title=How the Internet Led to the Decline of Female Film Critics|date=2015-12-27|accessdate=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clem Bastow, culture writer at ''[[The Guardian Australia]]'', discussed the possible effects of this on the critical response to the 2015 film ''[[The Intern (2015 film)|The Intern]]'', which received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics:&lt;blockquote&gt;The critical response to ''The Intern'' was fascinating. There’s a subset of male critics that clearly see Nancy Meyers as code for chick flick and react with according bile. What’s very interesting, though, is that I think female critics, working in an industry that is coded as very male, if not macho, often feel the need to go hard on certain films for women, presumably because they worry that they’ll be dismissed, critically speaking, if they praise a film like ''The Intern'' as though they’re only reviewing it favorably because they’re women.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Film Critic Salary ==
As of 2013 film critics make about $82,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://work.chron.com/pay-scale-movie-critics-19069.html|title=Pay Scale for Movie Critics|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newspaper and Magazine critics would make $27,364-$49,574.&lt;ref name="Bizfluent"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bizfluent.com/info-8519831-much-do-movie-critics-make.html|title=How Much Money Do Movie Critics Make?|work=Bizfluent|access-date=2018-05-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online movie critics would make $2-$200 per review.&lt;ref name="Bizfluent"/&gt; TV critics would make up to $40,000-$60,000 per month.&lt;ref name="Bizfluent"/&gt;

The '''[[New Hampshire|state of New Hampshire]]''' has held two '''[[seal (device)|seal]]s''' since it declared its independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] on January 5, 1776. While both seals have been retained, most people are only familiar with the Great Seal due to its [[corporate]] use.

==Great Seal==
[[File:New Hampshire State Seal 1904.png|thumb|upright|left|1904 version with image of the ''Raleigh'' but still retaining Latin inscription]]
New Hampshire's state seal depicts the [[frigate]] {{USS|Raleigh|1776|6}} and is surrounded by a laurel wreath with nine stars. The ''Raleigh'' is one of the first 13 warships sponsored by the [[Continental Congress]] for a new American navy, built in 1776, at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. The seal is surrounded by a laurel wreath. The wreath is an ancient symbol of fame, honor, and victory.  The nine stars within the wreath show that New Hampshire was the ninth state to join the Union.  The water stands for the harbor of Portsmouth, and in the yellow-colored spit of land is granite, a strong igneous rock, representing both New Hampshire's rugged landscape and the sturdy character of her people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flag-works.com/blog/new-hampshire-state-flag/new-hampshire-state-flag-nh/ New Hampshire State Flag NH updated 1931]"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1784, when the present [[New Hampshire Constitution|state constitution]] became effective, the legislature revised the seal to depict a ship on stocks, with a rising sun in the background, to reflect [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] having become a major shipbuilding center during the war years. Over the years, various items for shipment were also shown on the frontal dock in the seal.

In 1919, [[New Hampshire Historical Society]] Director Otis G. Hammond, on the order of the [[Governor of New Hampshire|Governor]] and [[Executive Council of New Hampshire]], wrote a history of the state seal and flag. Hammond described how because the law governing the design of the seal was not very specific, when the dies wore down and had to be redesigned, the artists and sketchers had injected surprising details into the seal, such as rum barrels on the dock, sometimes including people standing beside them.   In 1931, after Governor [[John G. Winant]] began his second term, he named a committee to produce a seal devoid of controversy. The [[New Hampshire General Court|General Court]] approved the committee's recommendations, later enacting a law codifying the official design of the state seal.

===State Seal law of 1931===
The 1931 State Seal law placed the frigate [[USS Raleigh (1776)|''Raleigh'']] as the centerpiece of the new seal.  The ''Raleigh'' was built in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] in 1776, as one of the first 13 warships sponsored by the [[Continental Congress]] for a new American [[United States Navy|navy]].  The law declared the seal to be 2&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter bearing the new inscription, ''SEAL • OF • THE • STATE • OF • NEW HAMPSHIRE,'' replacing the Latin phrase ''Sigillum Reipublicae Neo Hantoniensis.'' The law also declared that only a granite boulder could be shown in the foreground.

==Flag==
[[File:Flag of New Hampshire (1909-1931).png|thumb|upright|float|right|{{FIAV|historical}} The flag of New Hampshire from 1909 to 1931.]]
The '''[[Flags of the U.S. states|flag]] of the [[New Hampshire|state of New Hampshire]]''' consists of the [[Seal of New Hampshire|state seal]] centered on a blue background.

The New Hampshire state flag's design was ranked 63rd out of 72 flags of [[U.S. state]]s and [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territories]]), and [[provinces and territories of Canada]] in a 2001 internet poll run by the [[North American Vexillological Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nava.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/NAVANews_2001_vol34no2.pdf NAVA 2001 Flag Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;

At least one elected official has suggested replacing the state seal in the center of the flag with the [[Old Man of the Mountain]], to memorialize its collapse in 2003, but no official action has been taken on the proposal.

==Alternate seal==
[[File:ColonyofNewHampshireSeal.png|thumb|175px|left|Colony Seal]]

===First independent seal===
On July 1, 1774, the First [[New Hampshire Provincial Congress|Provincial Congress]] met for the first time in [[Exeter, New Hampshire|Exeter]], and subsequently they discarded every "Royal," including the previous "George the III" seal.

In preparation of the [[s:Constitution of New Hampshire|1776 state constitution]], the First Provincial Congress designed a seal measuring 1½ inches in diameter and depicting an upright fish and pine tree on either side of a bundle of five arrows. The fish and pine represented the main trade of the colony and the five arrows represented each of the five counties.  The seal bore the inscription: ''COLONY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE * VIS UNITA FORTIOR''.

The Latin motto ''vis unita fortior'' means "A united force (is) stronger." The motto was meant to unify the counties and was never officially proclaimed, but was used during the [[American Revolution]] until 1784.  While no official document prescribing the seal has been located, the first record of the seal is found on commissions issued to military officers by the Provincial Congress dated September 1, 1775. The last known use of the seal was on an act of the General Assembly on July 5, 1776. This seal continues to be published by the New Hampshire General Court on along with the modern seal, on the cover of copies of the State Constitution.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Rei-pub neohantoni.png|left|175px|thumb|State Seal of 1776]] --&gt;

===First state seal, 1776===
It is believed that the die used to affix the seal was designed during the summer of 1776. The first state seal was officially prescribed in an act passed September 12, 1776, two days after the resolution of statehood.  The seal is still used by some members of the General Court, though there is no current statute governing its design or use. In recent years, those freedom and liberty minded Representatives and Senators have promoted the original seal as a reminder, and a symbol, of when the people valued their freedom and liberty over government control.

The size of the seal was increased to 1¾ inches, and comprised a pine tree and an upright fish, on each side of a bundle of five arrows. The design reflected the state's then two major economic resources, and the arrows symbolized the strength of unity among the then five counties. The seal bears the inscription (in Latin): ''SIGILL : REI - PUB : NEOHANTONI : * VIS UNITA FORTIOR*''.

==History and profile==
''frankie magazine'' was launched in October 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Dale|title=Magazines in a bind|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/magazines-in-a-bind-20130823-2sf6j.html|accessdate=30 April 2016|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; by editor Louise Bannister and creative director Lara Burke.&lt;ref name="meg"&gt;{{cite news|author=Megan Reynolds|title=Frankie Press co-founders depart as Morrison Media moves sales hub to Melbourne|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/frankie-press-co-founders-depart-204965|accessdate=29 October 2016|work=Mumbrella|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2008, Bannister was replaced by Jo Walker as editor, with Bannister becoming publisher.

''frankie magazine'' is owned and published by niche publisher Morrison Media, and makes up "frankiepress" along with its men's publication, ''Smith Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankiepress.com.au Frankie press]&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison Media was acquired by Pacific Star Network in November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alex Hayes|title=Frankie publisher Morrison Media bought out in $10m deal|url=https://mumbrella.com.au/frankie-publisher-morrison-media-bought-10m-deal-262164|accessdate=29 October 2016|work=Mumbrella|date=12 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both founders of the magazine, Louise Bannister and Lara Burke, left the magazine before the acquisition.&lt;ref name="meg"/&gt;

The magazine was headquartered in [[Queensland]] until 2013 when it was relocated in [[Melbourne]].&lt;ref name="meg"/&gt;

==Readership==
The magazine's audience has grown rapidly since its inception. It is now estimated to be read by 286,000 globally. Despite the 2008 [[Global Financial Crisis]], that saw Australian magazine sales drop 3%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Wells|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/forget-celebrity-goss-this-mag-plays-it-smart-and-cool-20100220-omrv.html|title=Forget celebrity goss, this mag plays it smart and cool|work=The Age|date=20 February 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;, frankie magazine's circulation rose by 31.60% in 2009: making frankie magazine the fastest growing magazine in Australia during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/06/09/2922264.htm|title=Homemade magazine bucks the trend|work=ABC|date=9 June 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication continued this trend in 2010, with circulation rising another 43.20%, according to the Australian Bureau of Circulation's January–June 2010 audit figures. This was the second year in a row that they had the highest growth out of all Australian magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbrella.com.au/abcs-masterchef-magazine-hits-the-big-time-while-rise-of-frankie-continues-31473|title=ABCs: Masterchef magazine hits the big time while rise of Frankie continues|work=Mumbrella|date=13 August 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, [[Harper's Bazaar]] had an increase of 9.04% over the same time period.

==Content==
frankie magazine covers a range of cultural topics that concern the 10 - to 15 -year-old age bracket. Their content features DIY and vintage culture as well as music, art, fashion, photography, craft, humour, hipster culture, illustration and design. ABC's [[7:30 Report]] described ''frankie magazine'' as being between "quite edgy" and "quite daggy", having a strong emphasis on strong, curious stories instead of diets and celebrity culture, supporting emerging artists, musicians, entrepreneurs and designers and preferring to profile up-and-coming hipsters rather than existing ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s2921938.htm|title=The 7.30 Report |work=ABC|date=8 June 2010|accessdate=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''''' Fur Traders Descending the Missouri''''' is an 1845 painting by [[George Caleb Bingham]]. Bingham brought the painting to [[St. Louis, Missouri]] on June 4, 1845, along with several other pieces of artwork.

One of Bingham's most famous paintings, this work is owned by the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]]. Painted around 1845 in the style called [[Luminism (American art style)|luminism]] by some historians of American art, it was originally entitled, ''French-Trader, [[Half-breed]] Son''. The [[American Art Union]] thought the title potentially controversial and renamed it when it was first exhibited. It reflected the reality of fur traders' common marriages with Native American women; in Canada the [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] ethnic group formed as a result. The painting is haunting for its evocation of an era in American history-—note, in particular, the [[Phrygian cap#In the United States|liberty cap]] worn by the older man. The animal in the boat is widely accepted as a bear cub and not a cat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/33.61 Metropolitan Museum of Art, Timeline]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Gaelic Symphony''''' or '''Symphony in E-Minor, Op. 32''' was written by [[Amy Marcy Cheney Beach]] in 1894; it was the first symphony composed and published by a female American composer.&lt;ref&gt;Gates, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece debuted in Boston on Friday, October 30, 1896 to "public and journalistic acclaim."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horowitz|first1=Joseph|title=Reclaiming the Past: Musical Boston Reconsidered|journal=American Music|date=2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=18–38|url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3052594?sid=21104939730051&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=2129|accessdate=27 December 2014|jstor=3052594|doi=10.2307/3052594}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beach drew inspiration for the large orchestral work from simple old English, Irish, and Scottish melodies; thus, she subtitled the work 'Gaelic.'

== History ==

Beach began composing her symphony in November 1894.  Although Beach would later become more accepting of music from North American traditions—such as Eskimo and Native American themes—Beach chose to incorporate songs of the European influence into her early works.  One such (Celtic) tune was her song entitled, "Dark Is the Night!" which she set to the words of the English poet [[William Ernest Henley]]. She borrowed this song for her symphony.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{allmusic|class=composition |id=mc0002366622 |accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beach was heavily influenced by her contemporary [[Antonín Dvořák]]; naturally, she looked to Dvořák's compositions and publicized philosophies on American music while composing her symphony.   Though Dvořák's nationality was Czech, he was in the United States for much of 1892-1895 as head of the [[National Conservatory of Music of America|National Conservatory in New York]]. He represented American art music in the late nineteenth century—specifically through his ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|New World Symphony]]'' and ''[[String Quartet No. 12 (Dvořák)|American String Quartet]]''. Dvořák wove [[pentatonic scale]]s from Native-American and African-American music and rhythms of [[Slavonic Dances|slavic dances]] along with his European romantic style to create works unique to America—the melting pot.  The "native" elements were not as readily embraced by Beach.  Upon hearing of the derivations of Dvořák's ''New World Symphony'', Beach heartily responded, "[w]e of the North should be far more likely to be influenced by old English, Scotch or Irish songs, inherited with our literature from our ancestors."&lt;ref&gt;Haller, Steven J.  "Beach: 'Gaelic Symphony; Piano Concerto'."  American Record Guide 66, no. 5 (Sept. 2003): 73-75.&lt;/ref&gt;  When her symphony premiered, Beach was barely 30 years old and in the throes of forming her own compositional style; in contrast, her later years brought maturity and an openness to infuse Native-American, specifically Inuit,&lt;ref&gt;Block 1998, pp. 126-127, also accessed December 14, 2014.  ProQuest ebrary.&lt;/ref&gt; and African-American songs into her music.

The work was published by Schmidt in 1897,&lt;ref name=naxos&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.559139&amp;catNum=559139&amp;filetype=About%20this%20Recording&amp;language=English |title=BEACH: Piano Concerto / 'Gaelic' Symphony |publisher=[[Naxos Records|NAXOS]] |accessdate=2018-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was dedicated to "herrn [[Kapellmeister|Capellmeister]] [[Emil Paur]]".&lt;ref name=score&gt;Score: Beach, Symphony, Arthur P. Schmidt, Boston, 1898.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

In keeping with tradition passing through [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], a [[symphony]] is divided into four contrasting movements.  The Gaelic Symphony is typically performed in thirty-five to forty minutes.  With a full romantic harmonic structure and a glimpse of the horizons of modern music, Beach's ''Gaelic Symphony'' set her apart as a prominent female composer at the turn of the twentieth century.

The four movements of the symphony are as follows:

=== I. Allegro con fuoco ===
The symphony begins with a low chromatic rumble in the strings which provides the basis on which the romantic melody is built.  Rich orchestration establishes the romantic style of the symphony. Its unusual key choices mirror those in the first movement of Dvořák's ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|New World Symphony]]''&lt;ref name=musicelleanea&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://musicellanea.blogspot.com/2018/10/amy-beach-her-old-world-symphony.html |title=Amy Beach &amp; Her "Old World" Symphony |accessdate=2018-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== II. Alla siciliana - allegro vivace ===
The gaelic themes are introduced in variation.

=== III. Lento con molta espressione ===
The third movement is melodic and slow in nature.

=== IV. Allegro di molto ===
The last movement of the symphony is brisk and thematic.

== Reception and performances ==
The ''Gaelic Symphony'' was well received.  Critic [[Philip Hale]]  "was generally enthusiastic about the work" although he "felt that Beach's orchestration was at times excessively heavy."&lt;ref&gt;Gates 2010, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  Composer [[George Whitefield Chadwick]]' wrote a letter to Beach: saying that he and [[Horatio Parker]], a fellow member of the unofficial [[Second New England School]] of leading composers, had heard and liked the Gaelic Symphony,  and: "...I always feel a thrill of pride myself whenever I hear a fine work by any of us, and as such you will have to be counted in, whether you will or not—one of the boys."&lt;ref&gt;Block 1998, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  Not long afterward Beach herself became recognized as one of the School, thereupon called the [[Boston Six]].

The Symphony was "forgotten during the 1920s" but "made a comeback in the 1930s and 1940s,"&lt;ref&gt;Block 1998, p.&amp;nbsp;256&lt;/ref&gt; being performed by multiple orchestras, some multiple times each, although not by "major" orchestras such as the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra|New York Philharmonic]] or [[Boston Symphony Orchestra|Boston Symphony]]. 

The symphony has received continued praise from modern critics as well, such as Andrew Achenbach of ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'', who in 2003 lauded the work for its "big heart, irresistible charm and confident progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Achenbach |first=Andrew |title=Beach Piano concerto; Symphony No 2: One of the most valuable releases yet in Naxos's American Classics series |work=[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]] |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/beach-piano-concerto-symphony-no-2 |accessdate=January 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Please do not remove the phrase and link to "creation myth" from the first paragraph without discussing your proposal on the talk page first. There has been a consensus since November 2011 to include it in the lead. You can read the archived talk discussion at: Talk:Genesis_creation_narrative/Archive_13#RfC:_Genesis_creation_narrative:_link_to_creation_myth.2C_yes_or_no.3F--&gt;

The '''Genesis creation narrative''' is the [[creation myth]] of both [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Leeming|Leeming|2009|p=113}} The narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the first two chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]]. In the first, [[Elohim]] (the Hebrew generic word for [[God]]) creates the heavens and the earth in six days, then rests on, blesses and sanctifies the [[Biblical Sabbath|seventh]]. In the second story, God, now referred to by the personal name [[Yahweh]], creates [[Adam]], the first man, from dust and places him in the [[Garden of Eden]], where he is given dominion over the animals. [[Eve]], the first woman, is created from Adam and as his companion.

Borrowing themes from [[Mesopotamian mythology]], but adapting them to the [[Israelites|Israelite]] people's [[monotheism|belief in one God]],{{sfn|Sarna|1997|p=50}} the first major comprehensive draft of the [[Pentateuch]] (the series of five books which begins with Genesis and ends with [[Deuteronomy]]) was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the [[Jahwist]] source) and was later expanded by other authors (the [[Priestly source]]) into a work very like the one we have today.{{sfn|Davies|2007|p=37}} The two sources can be identified in the creation narrative:  Priestly and Jahwistic.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=37}} The combined narrative is a critique of the Mesopotamian theology of creation: Genesis affirms monotheism and denies polytheism.{{sfn|Wenham|2003b|p=37}} [[Robert Alter]] described the combined narrative as "compelling in its archetypal character, its adaptation of myth to [[monotheist]]ic ends".{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=xii}}

Misunderstanding the [[genre]] of the Genesis creation narrative, meaning the intention of the author(s) and the culture within which they wrote, can result in a misreading.{{sfn|Andersen|1987|p=142}} [[Bruce Waltke]], a well-known evangelical scholar, cautions against one such misreading, the approach which reads it as history rather than theology and so leads to [[Creationism]] and the denial of [[evolution]].{{sfn|Waltke|1991|pp=6–9}} As noted scholar of [[Jewish studies]], [[Jon D. Levenson]], puts it:
{{quote|How much history lies behind the story of Genesis? Because the action of the primeval story is not represented as taking place on the plane of ordinary human history and has so many affinities with ancient mythology, it is very far-fetched to speak of its narratives as historical at all."{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=11}}}}

{{See also|Documentary hypothesis}}
Although tradition attributes Genesis to [[Moses]], biblical scholars hold that it, together with the following four books (making up what Jews call the [[Torah]] and biblical scholars call the Pentateuch), is "a composite work, the product of many hands and periods."{{sfn|Speiser|1964|p=xxi}} A common hypothesis among biblical scholars today is that the first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch was composed in the late 7th or the 6th century BCE (the [[Jahwist]] source), and that this was later expanded by the addition of various narratives and laws (the [[Priestly source]]) into a work very like the one existing today.{{sfn|Davies|2007|p=37}}

As for the historical background which led to the creation of the narrative itself, a theory which has gained considerable interest, although still controversial, is "Persian imperial authorisation". This proposes that the Persians, after their [[Babylon#Persia captures Babylon|conquest of Babylon]] in 538 BCE, agreed to grant Jerusalem a large measure of local autonomy within the empire, but required the local authorities to produce a single [[List of ancient legal codes|law code]] accepted by the entire community. It further proposes that there were two powerful groups in the community – the priestly families who controlled the Temple, and the landowning families who made up the "elders" – and that these two groups were in conflict over many issues, and that each had its own "history of origins", but the Persian promise of greatly increased local autonomy for all provided a powerful incentive to cooperate in producing a single text.{{sfn|Ska|2006|pp=169, 217–18}}

===Structure===
The creation narrative is made up of two stories, roughly equivalent to the two first chapters of the [[Book of Genesis]].{{sfn|Alter|1981|p=141}} (There are no chapter divisions in the original Hebrew text, see [[Chapters and verses of the Bible]].) The first account (1:1 through 2:3) employs a repetitious structure of divine fiat and fulfillment, then the statement "And there was evening and there was morning, the [''x''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;] day," for each of the six days of creation. In each of the first three days there is an act of division: day one divides the darkness from light, day two the "waters above" from the "waters below", and day three the sea from the land. In each of the next three days these divisions are populated: day four populates the darkness and light with sun, moon and stars; day five populates seas and skies with fish and fowl; and finally land-based creatures and mankind populate the land.{{sfn|Ruiten|2000|pp=9–10}}

[[Wikt:consistency|Consistency]] was evidently not seen as essential to storytelling in ancient Near Eastern literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "One aspect of narrative in Genesis that requires special attention is its high tolerance for different versions of the same event, a well-known feature of ancient Near Eastern literature, from earliest times through rabbinic midrash. ... This could not have happened if the existence of variation were seen as a serious defect or if rigid consistency were deemed essential to effective storytelling."&lt;/ref&gt; The overlapping stories of Genesis 1 and 2 are contradictory but also complementary, with the first (the Priestly story) concerned with the creation of the entire cosmos while the second (the Yahwist story) focuses on man as moral agent and cultivator of his environment.{{sfn|Alter|1981|p=141}} The highly regimented seven-day narrative of Genesis 1 features an omnipotent God who creates a god-like humanity, while the one-day creation of Genesis 2 uses a simple linear narrative, a God who can fail as well as succeed, and a humanity which is not god-like but is punished for acts which would lead to their becoming god-like.{{sfn|Carr|1996|pp=62–64}} Even the order and method of creation differs.{{sfn|Carr|1996|pp=62–64}} "Together, this combination of parallel character and contrasting profile point to the different origin of materials in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2, however elegantly they have now been combined."{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=64}}

The primary accounts in each chapter are joined by a literary bridge at Genesis 2:4|, "These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created." This echoes the first line of Genesis 1, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth", and is reversed in the next phrase, "...in the day that the {{LORD}} God made the earth and the heavens". This verse is one of ten "generations" ({{lang-he|תולדות}} ''{{transl|he|[[toledot]]}}'') phrases used throughout Genesis, which provide a literary structure to the book.{{sfn|Cross|1973|pp=301ff}} They normally function as headings to what comes after, but the position of this, the first of the series, has been the subject of much debate.{{sfn|Thomas|2011| pp=27–28}}

[[Comparative mythology]] provides historical and cross-cultural perspectives for [[Jewish mythology]]. Both sources behind the Genesis creation narrative borrowed themes from [[Mesopotamian mythology]],{{sfn|Lambert 1965}}{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=9}} but adapted them to [[God in Judaism|their belief in one God]],{{sfn|Sarna|1997|p=50}} establishing a monotheistic creation in opposition to the polytheistic creation myth of [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel's]] neighbors.{{sfn|Leeming|2004}}{{sfn|Smith|2001}}

Genesis 1–11 as a whole is imbued with Mesopotamian myths.{{sfn|Lambert 1965}}{{sfn|Kutsko|2000|p=62, quoting J. Maxwell Miller}}  Genesis 1 bears both striking differences from and striking similarities to Babylon's national creation myth, the [[Enuma Elish]].{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=9}} On the side of similarities, both begin from a stage of chaotic waters before anything is created, in both a fixed dome-shaped "firmament" divides these waters from the habitable Earth, and both conclude with the creation of a human called "man" and the building of a temple for the god (in Genesis 1, this temple is the entire cosmos).{{sfn|McDermott|2002|pp=25–27}}  On the side of contrasts, Genesis 1 is [[monotheism|monotheistic]], it makes [[theogony|no attempt to account for the origins of God]], and there is no trace of the resistance to the reduction of chaos to order (Gk. [[theomachy]], lit. "God-fighting"), all of which mark the Mesopotamian creation accounts.{{sfn|Sarna|1997|p=50}} Still, Genesis 1 bears similarities to the [[Baal Cycle]] of Israel's neighbor, [[Ugarit]].{{sfn|Smith|2001|loc=Chapter 6}}

The Enuma Elish has also left traces on Genesis 2. Both begin with a series of statements of what did not exist at the moment when creation began; the Enuma Elish has a spring (in the sea) as the point where creation begins, paralleling the spring (on the land – Genesis 2 is notable for being a "dry" creation story) in Genesis 2:6 that "watered the whole face of the ground"; in both myths, Yahweh/the gods first create a man to serve him/them, then animals and vegetation. At the same time, and as with Genesis 1, the Jewish version has drastically changed its Babylonian model: Eve, for example, seems to fill the role of a [[mother goddess]] when, in Genesis 4:1, she says that she has "created a man with Yahweh", but she is not a divine being like her Babylonian counterpart.{{sfn|Van Seters|1992|pp=122–24}}

Genesis 2 has close parallels with a second Mesopotamian myth, the [[Atra-Hasis]] epic – parallels that in fact extend throughout Genesis 2–11, from the Creation to the [[Noah's ark|Flood]] and its aftermath. The two share numerous plot-details (e.g. the divine garden and the role of the first man in the garden, the creation of the man from a mixture of earth and divine substance, the chance of immortality, etc.), and have a similar overall theme: the gradual clarification of man's relationship with God(s) and animals.{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=64}}

The Garden of Eden story is compared to the [[Sumer]]ian myth in which the goddess [[Ninhursag]] created a beautiful garden full of lush vegetation and fruit trees, called [[Edinu]], in [[Dilmun]], the Sumerian earthly Paradise, a place which the Sumerians believed to exist to the east of their own land, beyond the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Noah Kramer|Kramer, Samuel Noah]]. ''History Begins at Sumer: Thirty-Nine Firsts in Recorded History'' (1956)&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}} Ninhursag charged [[Enki]], her lover and half brother, with controlling the wild animals and tending the garden, but Enki became curious about the garden, and his assistant, [[Adapa]], selected seven plants (eight in some versions) and offered them to Enki, who ate them. This enraged Ninhursag, and she caused Enki to fall ill. Enki felt pain in his rib, which is a [[pun]] in Sumerian, as the word "''{{lang|sux|ti}}''" means both "rib" and "life". The other deities persuaded Ninhursag to relent. Ninhursag then created a new goddess (seven or eight to heal his seven or eight ailing organs, including his rib), who was named [[Ninti]], (a name composed of "''{{lang|sux|Nin}}''", or "lady", and "''{{lang|sux|ti}}''", and which may be translated both as "Lady of Living" and "Lady of the Rib"), to cure Enki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Ancient Deities|editor1=Charles Russell Coulter |editor2=Patricia Turner }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars suggest that this served as the basis for the story of Eve as "the mother of life" and lady of the rib, created from [[Adam]]'s rib in the [[Book of Genesis]].&lt;ref name="Meagher 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Meagher|first=Robert Emmet|title=The meaning of Helen : in search of an ancient icon|year=1995|publisher=BOLCHAZY-CARDUCCI PUBS (IL)|location=United States|isbn=0865165106}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2018}}

===Creation by word and creation by combat===
The narratives in Genesis 1 and 2 were not the only creation myths in ancient Israel, and the complete biblical evidence suggests two contrasting models.{{sfn|Dolansky|2016}} The first is the "[[logos]]" (meaning speech) model, where a supreme God "speaks" dormant matter into existence. The second is the "[[agon]]" (meaning struggle or combat) model, in which it is God's victory in battle over the monsters of the sea that mark his sovereignty and might.{{sfn|Fishbane|2003|pp=34–35}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Graves and Patai|1986}}"Chapter 6"&lt;/ref&gt; Genesis 1 is an example of creation by speech, while [[Psalm 74]] and [[Isaiah 51]] are examples of the "agon" mythology, recalling a Canaanite myth in which God creates the world by vanquishing the water deities: "Awake, awake! ... It was you that hacked Rahab in pieces, that pierced the Dragon! It was you that dried up the Sea, the waters of the great Deep, that made the abysses of the Sea a road that the redeemed might walk..."{{sfn|Hutton|2007|p=274}}

==Genesis 1:1–2:3==
[[File:Europe a Prophecy, copy D, object 1 (Bentley 1, Erdman i, Keynes i) British Museum.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[The Ancient of Days]] ([[William Blake]], 1794)]]

===Background===
The cosmos created in Genesis 1 bears a striking resemblance to the [[Tabernacle]] in Exodus 35–40, which was the prototype of the Temple in Jerusalem and the focus of priestly worship of [[Yahweh]]; for this reason, and because other Middle Eastern creation stories also climax with the construction of a temple/house for the creator-god, Genesis 1 can be interpreted as a description of the construction of the cosmos as God's house, for which the Temple in Jerusalem served as the earthly representative.{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=13}}

The word ''bara'' is translated as "created" in English, but the concept it embodied was not the same as the modern term: in the world of the [[ancient Near East]], the gods demonstrated their power over the world not by creating matter but by fixing destinies, so that the essence of the ''bara'' which God performs in Genesis concerns bringing "heaven and earth" (a [[Merism|set phrase]] meaning "everything") into existence by organising and assigning roles and functions.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}}

The use of numbers in ancient texts was often [[Significance of numbers in Judaism|numerological]] rather than factual – that is, the numbers were used because they held some symbolic value to the author.{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=74}} The number seven, denoting divine completion, permeates Genesis 1: verse 1:1 consists of seven words, verse 1:2 of fourteen, and 2:1–3 has 35 words (5x7); Elohim is mentioned 35 times, "heaven/firmament" and "earth" 21 times each, and the phrases "and it was so" and "God saw that it was good" occur 7 times each.{{sfn|Wenham|1987|p=6}}

===Pre-creation: Genesis 1:1–2===
:1 In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness ''[was]'' upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:1–1:2|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the opening phrase of [[Genesis 1:1]] is commonly translated in English as above, the Hebrew is [[ambiguous]], and can be translated at least three ways:
# as a statement that the [[cosmos]] had an absolute beginning ("In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.");
# as a statement describing the condition of the world when God began creating ("When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was untamed and shapeless."); and
# essentially similar to the second version but taking all of Genesis 1:2 as background information ("When in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, the earth being untamed and shapeless, God said, Let there be light!").{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|pp=38–39}}

The second seems to be the meaning intended by the original Priestly author: the verb ''bara'' is used only of God (people do not engage in ''bara''), and it concerns the assignment of roles, as in the creation of the first people as "[[male]] and [[female]]" (i.e., it allocates them [[sexes]]): in other words, the power of God is being shown not by the creation of matter but by the fixing of destinies.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}}

''The heavens and the earth'' is a [[set phrase]] meaning "[[everything]]", i.e., the [[cosmos]]. This was made up of three levels, the habitable earth in the middle, the heavens above, an [[underworld]] below, all [[Cosmic ocean|surrounded by a watery "ocean" of chaos]] as the Babylonian ''[[Tiamat]]''.{{sfn|Spence|2010|p=72}} The earth itself was a flat disc, surrounded by mountains or sea. Above it was the [[firmament]], a transparent but solid dome resting on the mountains, allowing men to see the blue of the waters above, with "windows" to allow the rain to enter, and containing the sun, moon and stars. The waters extended below the earth, which rested on pillars sunk in the waters, and in the underworld was [[Sheol]], the abode of the dead.{{sfn|Knight|1990|pp=175–76}}

The opening of [[Genesis 1]] continues: "And the earth was formless and void..." The phrase "formless and void" is a translation of the Hebrew ''{{transl|he|[[tohu wa-bohu]]}}'', ({{lang-he|תֹהוּ וָבֹהוּ}}), chaos, the condition that ''bara'', ordering, remedies.{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=}} ''Tohu'' by itself means "emptiness, futility"; it is used to describe the desert wilderness; ''bohu'' has no known meaning and was apparently coined to rhyme with and reinforce ''tohu''.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=17}} The phrase appears also in Jeremiah 4:23 where the prophet warns Israel that rebellion against God will lead to the return of darkness and chaos, "as if the earth had been 'uncreated'".{{sfn|Thompson|1980|p=230}}

The opening of Genesis 1 concludes with a statement that "''darkness'' was on the face of the ''deep''" ({{lang-he|תְהוֹם}} ''{{transl|he|[[Tehom|t&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;hôm]]}}''), [the] "darkness" and the "deep" being two of the three elements of the [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]] represented in ''{{transl|he|[[tohu wa-bohu]]}}'' (the third is the "formless earth"). In the [[Enuma Elish]], the "deep" is personified as the goddess [[Tiamat]], the enemy of [[Marduk]];{{sfn|Walton|2001|p=}} here it is the ''formless body of primeval water surrounding the habitable world'', later to be released during the [[Deluge myth|Deluge]], when "all the fountains of the great deep burst forth" from the waters beneath the earth and from the "windows" of the sky.{{sfn|Wenham|2003a|p=29}}

The ''Rûach'' of God moves over the face of the ''deep'' before creation begins. ''Rûach'' ({{lang|he|רוּחַ}}) has the meanings "wind, spirit, breath", and ''{{transl|he|elohim}}'' can mean "great" as well as "god": the ''{{transl|he|ruach elohim}}''  may therefore mean the "wind/breath of God" (the storm-wind is God's breath in Psalms 18:16 and elsewhere, and the wind of God returns in the Flood story as the means by which God restores the earth), or God's "spirit", a concept which is somewhat vague in Hebrew Bible, or it may simply signify a great storm-wind.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|pp=33–34}}

===Six days of Creation: Genesis 1:3–2:3===
[[File:The Creation - Bible Historiale (c.1411), vol.1, f.3 - BL Royal MS 19 D III.jpg|thumbnail|The Creation – [[Bible Historiale]] (c. 1411)]]
God's first act was the creation of undifferentiated light; dark and light were then separated into night and day, their order (evening before morning) signifying that this was the liturgical day; and then the sun, moon and stars were created to mark the proper times for the festivals of the week and year. Only when this is done does God create man and woman and the means to sustain them (plants and animals). At the end of the sixth day, when creation is complete, the world is a cosmic temple in which the role of humanity is the worship of God. This parallels Mesopotamian myth (the ''Enuma Elish'') and also echoes chapter 38 of the [[Book of Job]], where God recalls how the stars, the "sons of God", sang when the corner-stone of creation was laid.{{sfn|Blenkinsopp|2011|pp=21–22}}

====First day====
:3 And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
:4 And God saw the light, that [it was] good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:3–1:5|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Day 1 begins with the creation of light (and, by implication, time). God creates by spoken command and names the elements of the world as he creates them. In the ancient Near East the act of naming was bound up with the act of creating: thus in Egyptian literature the creator god pronounced the names of everything, and the Enûma Elish begins at the point where nothing has yet been named.{{sfn|Walton|2003|p=158}} God's creation by speech also suggests that he is being compared to a king, who has merely to speak for things to happen.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=39}}

====Second day====
:6 And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
:7 And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which ''[were]'' under the firmament from the waters which ''[were]'' above the firmament: and it was so.
:8 And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:6–1:8|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Rāqîa‘'', the word translated as [[firmament]], is from ''rāqa‘,'' the verb used for the act of beating metal into thin plates.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|p=122}} Created on the second day of creation and populated by luminaries on the fourth, it is a solid dome which separates the earth below from the heavens and their waters above, as in Egyptian and Mesopotamian belief of the same time.{{sfn|Seeley|1991|p=227}} In Genesis 1:17 the stars are set in the ''raqia‘''; in Babylonian myth the heavens were made of various precious stones (compare Exodus 24:10 where the elders of Israel see God on the sapphire floor of heaven), with the stars engraved in their surface.{{sfn|Walton|2003|pp=158–59}}

====Third day====
:9 And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry ''[land]'' appear: and it was so.
:10 And God called the dry ''[land]'' Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that ''[it was]'' good.
:11 And God said: 'Let the earth put forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree bearing fruit after its kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth.' And it was so.
:12 And the earth brought forth grass, ''[and]'' herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed ''[was]'' in itself, after his kind: and God saw that ''[it was]'' good.
:13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:9–1:13|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the third day, the waters withdraw, creating a ring of ocean surrounding a [[Flat Earth|single circular continent]].{{sfn|Seeley|1997|p=236}} By the end of the third day God has created a foundational environment of light, heavens, seas and earth.{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|p=41}} The three levels of the cosmos are next populated in the same order in which they were created – heavens, sea, earth.

God does not create or make trees and plants, but instead commands the earth to produce them. The underlying theological meaning seems to be that God has given the previously barren earth the ability to produce vegetation, and it now does so at his command. "According to (one's) kind" appears to look forward to the laws found later in the Pentateuch, which lay great stress on holiness through separation.{{sfn|Kissling|2004|p=106}}

====Fourth day====
:14 And God said: ‘Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years;
:15 and let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth.’ And it was so.
:16 And God made the two great lights: the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; and the stars.
:17 And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,
:18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good.
:19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:14–1:19|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Day Four the language of "ruling" is introduced: the heavenly bodies will "govern" day and night and mark seasons and years and days (a matter of crucial importance to the Priestly authors, as religious festivals were organised around the cycles of the sun and moon);{{sfn|Bandstra|2008|pp=41–42}} later, man will be created to rule over the whole of creation as God's regent. God puts "lights" in the firmament to "rule over" the day and the night.{{sfn|Walsh|2001|p=37 (fn.5)}}  Specifically, God creates the "greater light," the "lesser light," and the stars.  According to Victor Hamilton, most scholars agree that the choice of "greater light" and "lesser light", rather than the more explicit "sun" and "moon", is anti-mythological rhetoric intended to contradict widespread contemporary beliefs that the sun and the moon were deities themselves.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|p=127}}

====Fifth day====
:20 And God said: ‘Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let fowl fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.’
:21 And God created the great sea-monsters, and every living creature that creepeth, wherewith the waters swarmed, after its kind, and every winged fowl after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
:22 And God blessed them, saying: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the earth.’
:23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day. &lt;br&gt;—({{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:20–1:23|HE}})

In the Egyptian and Mesopotamian mythologies, the creator-god has to do battle with the sea-monsters before he can make heaven and earth; in Genesis 1:21, the word ''tannin'', sometimes translated as "sea monsters" or "great creatures", parallels the named [[Chaos (cosmogony)#Chaoskampf|chaos-monsters]] [[Rahab (Egypt)|Rahab]] and [[Leviathan]] from Psalm 74:13, and Isaiah 27:1, and Isaiah 51:9, but there is no hint (in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]) of combat, and the ''tannin'' are simply creatures created by God.{{sfn|Walton|2003|p=160}}

====Sixth day====
[[File:Criação dos Animais (1506-11) - Vasco Fernandes (Museu de Lamego).png|thumb|right|''The Creation of the Animals'' (1506–11), by [[Grão Vasco]]]]
:24 And God said: ‘Let the earth bring forth the living creature after its kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after its kind.’ And it was so.
:25 And God made the beast of the earth after its kind, and the cattle after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the ground after its kind; and God saw that it was good.
:26 And God said: ‘Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.’
:27 And God created man in His own image, in the image of God created He him; male and female created He them.
:28 And God blessed them; and God said unto them: ‘Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that creepeth upon the earth.’
:29 And God said: ‘Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed—to you it shall be for food;
:30 and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is a living soul, [I have given] every green herb for food.’ And it was so.
:31 And God saw every thing that He had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|Genesis|1:24–31|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When in Genesis 1:26 God says "Let us make man", the Hebrew word used is ''adam''; in this form it is a generic noun, "mankind", and does not imply that this creation is male. After this first mention the word always appears as ''ha-adam'', "the man", but as Genesis 1:27 shows ("So God created man in his ''[own]'' image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them."), the word is still not exclusively male.{{sfn|Alter|2004|pp=18–19, 21}}

Man was created in the "[[image of God]]". The meaning of this is unclear: suggestions include:
# Having the spiritual qualities of God such as intellect, will, etc.;
# Having the physical form of God;
# A combination of these two;
# Being God's counterpart on earth and able to enter into a relationship with him;
# Being God's representative or viceroy on earth.{{sfn|Kvam et al. 1999|p=24}}

The fact that God says "Let ''us'' make man..." has given rise to several theories, of which the two most important are that "us" is [[majestic plural]],{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=24}} or that it reflects a setting in a [[Divine Council#Hebrew|divine council]] with God enthroned as king and proposing the creation of mankind to the lesser divine beings.{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=14}}

God tells the animals and humans that he has given them "the green plants for food"{{snd}} creation is to be vegetarian. Only later, after the Flood, is man given permission to eat flesh. The Priestly author of Genesis appears to look back to an ideal past in which mankind lived at peace both with itself and with the animal kingdom, and which could be re-achieved through a proper sacrificial life in [[Pre-established harmony|harmony with God]].{{sfn|Rogerson|1991|pp=19ff}}

Upon completion, God sees that "every thing that He had made ... was very good" ({{Bibleverse|Genesis|1:31|HE}}). This implies that the materials that existed before the Creation ("''[[tohu wa-bohu]]''," "darkness," "''[[tehom]]''") were not "very good." [[Israel Knohl]] hypothesized that the Priestly source set up this dichotomy to mitigate [[the problem of evil]].{{sfn|Knohl|2003|p=13}}

===Seventh day: divine rest===
:1 And the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.
:2 And on the seventh day God finished His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had made.
:3 And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it; because that in it He rested from all His work which God in creating had made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse|Genesis|2:1–2:3|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Creation is followed by rest. In ancient Near Eastern literature the divine rest is achieved in a temple as a result of having brought order to chaos. Rest is both disengagement, as the work of creation is finished, but also engagement, as the deity is now present in his temple to maintain a secure and ordered cosmos.{{sfn|Walton|2006|pp=157–58}} Compare with Exodus 20:8–20:11: "Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour, and do all thy work; but the seventh day is a sabbath unto the LORD thy God, in it thou shalt not do any manner of work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates; for in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested on the seventh day; wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed it."

==Genesis 2:4–2:25==

[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - f 5v.png|thumb|right|200px|Seventh Day of Creation (from the 1493 Nuremberg Chronicle)]]
Genesis 2–3, the [[Garden of Eden]] story, was probably authored around 500 BCE as "a discourse on ideals in life, the danger in human glory, and the fundamentally ambiguous nature of humanity – especially human mental faculties".{{sfn|Stordalen|2000|pp=473–74}} The Garden in which the action takes place lies on the mythological border between the human and the divine worlds, probably on the far side of the [[Cosmic ocean]] near the rim of the world; following a conventional ancient Near Eastern concept, the Eden river first forms that ocean and then divides into four rivers which run from the four corners of the earth towards its centre.{{sfn|Stordalen|2000|pp=473–74}}
It opens "in the day that the {{LORD}} God made the earth and the heavens", a set introduction similar to those found in Babylonian myths.{{sfn|Van Seters|1998|p=22}} Before the man is created the earth is a barren waste watered by an ''ed''; Genesis 2:6 the [[King James Version]] translated this as "mist", following Jewish practice, but since the mid-20th century Hebraists have generally accepted that the real meaning is "spring of underground water".{{sfn|Andersen|1987|pp=137–40}}

In Genesis 1 the characteristic word for God's activity is ''bara'', "created"; in Genesis 2 the word used when he creates the man is ''yatsar'', meaning "fashioned", a word used in contexts such as a potter fashioning a pot from clay.{{sfn|Alter|2004|pp=20, 22}} God breathes his own breath into the clay and it becomes ''nephesh'', a word meaning "life", "vitality", "the living personality"; man shares ''nephesh'' with all creatures, but the text describes this life-giving act by God only in relation to man.{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=31}}

Eden, where God puts his [[Garden of Eden]], comes from a root meaning "fertility": the first man is to work in God's miraculously fertile garden.{{sfn|Levenson|2004|p=15}} The "tree of life" is a motif from Mesopotamian myth: in the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' the hero is given a plant whose name is "man becomes young in old age", but a serpent steals the plant from him.{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=29}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Levenson|2004|p=9}} "The story of Adam and Eve's sin in the garden of Eden (2.25–3.24) displays similarities with Gilgamesh, an epic poem that tells how its hero lost the opportunity for immortality and came to terms with his humanity. ... the biblical narrator has adapted the Mesopotamian forerunner to Israelite theology."&lt;/ref&gt; There has been much scholarly discussion about the type of knowledge given by the second tree. Suggestions include: human qualities, sexual consciousness, ethical knowledge, or universal knowledge; with the last being the most widely accepted.{{sfn|Kooij|2010|p=17}} In Eden, mankind has a choice between wisdom and life, and chooses the first, although God intended them for the second.{{sfn|Propp|1990|p=193}}

The mythic Eden and its rivers may represent the real Jerusalem, the [[Temple of Solomon|Temple]] and the Promised Land. Eden may represent the divine garden on [[Zion]], the mountain of God, which was also Jerusalem; while the real [[Gihon]] was a spring outside the city (mirroring the spring which waters Eden); and the imagery of the Garden, with its serpent and cherubs, has been seen as a reflection of the real images of the Solomonic Temple with its copper serpent (the [[nehushtan]]) and guardian cherubs.{{sfn|Stordalen|2000|pp=307–10}} Genesis 2 is the only place in the Bible where Eden appears as a geographic location: elsewhere (notably in the Book of Ezekiel) it is a mythological place located on the holy Mountain of God, with echoes of a Mesopotamian myth of the king as a primordial man placed in a divine garden to guard the tree of life.{{sfn|Davidson|1973|p=33}}

"[[Good and evil]]" is a [[merism]], in this case meaning simply "everything", but it may also have a moral connotation. When God forbids the man to eat from the tree of knowledge he says that if he does so he is "doomed to die": the Hebrew behind this is in the form used in the Bible for issuing death sentences.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=21}}

The first woman is created to be ''ezer kenegdo'' – a term notably difficult to translate – to the man. ''Kenegdo'' means "alongside, opposite, a counterpart to him", and ''ezer'' means active intervention on behalf of the other person.{{sfn|Alter|2004|p=22}} God's naming of the elements of the cosmos in Genesis 1 illustrated his [[Divinity|authority over creation]]; now the man's naming of the animals (and of Woman) illustrates Adam's authority within creation.{{sfn|Turner|2009|p=20}}

The woman is called ''ishah'', "Woman", with an explanation that this is because she was taken from ''ish'', meaning "man"; the two words are not in fact connected. Later, after the story of the Garden is complete, she receives a name: ''Hawwah'' (Eve). This means "living" in Hebrew, from a root that can also mean "snake".{{sfn|Hastings|2003|p=607}} The word traditionally translated "rib" in English can also mean "side", "chamber", or "beam".{{sfn|Jacobs|2007|p=37}} A long-standing exegetical tradition holds that the use of a rib from man's side emphasizes that both man and woman have equal dignity, for woman was created from the same material as man, shaped and given life by the same processes.{{sfn|Hugenberger|1988|p=184}}  Medieval homilies about marriage as a sacrament stated that Eve was made from a more noble material (''the better half'') than Adam;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqUhR0QZIvEC|title=Geschlechterbeziehungen und Textfunktionen: Studien zu Eheschriften der Frühen Neuzeit|last=Schnell|first=Rüdiger|date=1998-01-01|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=|isbn=9783110940398|location=|pages=167 ff|language=de|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationism and the genre of Genesis 1–2==
{{creationism2}}{{See also|Literary genre|Myth (disambiguation)|Narrative}}
[[File:Adam and Eve by Lucas Cranach (I).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Eden ([[Lucas Cranach the Elder]], 1472–1553)]]

The meaning to be derived from the Genesis creation narrative will depend on the reader's understanding of its genre, the literary "type" to which it belongs: "it makes an enormous difference whether the first chapters of Genesis are read as scientific cosmology, creation myth, or historical saga".{{sfn|Wood|1990|pp=323–24}} Misunderstanding of the genre of the text, meaning the intention of the author/s and the culture within which they wrote, will result in a misreading.{{sfn|Andersen|1987|p=142}} [[Calvinism|Reformed]] [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] scholar [[Bruce Waltke]] cautions against one such misreading, the "woodenly literal" approach which leads to "[[creation science]]" and such "implausible interpretations" as the "[[gap theory]]", the presumption of a "[[young earth]]", and the denial of [[evolution]].{{sfn|Waltke|1991|pp=6–9}} Another scholar, [[Conrad Hyers]], sums up the same thought in these words: "A [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] interpretation of the Genesis accounts is inappropriate, misleading, and unworkable [because] it presupposes and insists upon a kind of literature and intention that is not there."{{sfn|Hyers|1984|p=28}}

Whatever else it may be, Genesis 1 is "story", since it features character and characterisation, a narrator, and dramatic tension expressed through a series of incidents arranged in time.{{sfn|Cotter|2003|pp=5–9}} The Priestly author of Genesis 1 had to confront two major difficulties. First, there is the fact that since only God exists at this point, no-one was available to be the narrator; the storyteller solved this by introducing an unobtrusive "third person narrator".{{sfn|Cotter|2003|p=7}} Second, there was the problem of conflict: conflict is necessary to arouse the reader's interest in the story, yet with nothing else existing, neither a chaos-monster nor another god, there cannot be any conflict. This was solved by creating a very minimal tension: God is opposed by nothingness itself, the blank of the world "without form and void."{{sfn|Cotter|2003|p=7}} Telling the story in this way was a deliberate choice: there are a number of creation stories in the Bible, but they tend to be told in the first person, by Wisdom, the instrument by which God created the world; the choice of [[Narrative mode#Third-person, omniscient|omniscient third-person narrator]] in the Genesis narrative allows the storyteller to create the impression that everything is being told and nothing held back.{{sfn|Cotter|2003|p=8}}

It can also be regarded as ancient history, "part of a broader spectrum of originally anonymous, history-like ancient Near Eastern narratives."{{sfn|Carr|1996|p=21}} It is frequently called myth in scholarly writings, but there is no agreement on how "myth" is to be defined, and so while [[Brevard Childs]] famously suggested that the author of Genesis 1–11 "demythologised" his narrative, meaning that he removed from his sources (the Babylonian myths) those elements which did not fit with his own faith, others can say it is entirely mythical.{{sfn|Hamilton|1990|pp=57–58}}

Genesis 1–2 can be seen as ancient science: in the words of [[E.A. Speiser]], "on the subject of creation biblical tradition aligned itself with the traditional tenets of Babylonian science."{{sfn|Seidman|2010|p=166}} The opening words of Genesis 1, "In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth", sum up the author(s) belief that [[Yahweh]], the god of Israel, was solely responsible for creation and had no rivals.{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=53}} Later Jewish thinkers, adopting ideas from Greek philosophy, concluded that [[Wisdom of God|God's Wisdom]], [[Logos|Word]] and [[Holy Spirit (Judaism)|Spirit]] penetrated all things and gave them unity.{{sfn|Kaiser|1997|p=28}}  Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and identified [[Jesus]] with the [[Logos (Christianity)|creative word]]: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" ([[John 1:1]]).{{sfn|Parrish|1990|pp=183–84}} When the Jews came into contact with Greek thought it led to a major reinterpretation of the underlying cosmology of the Genesis narrative. The biblical authors conceived the cosmos as a flat disc-shaped earth in the centre, an underworld for the dead below, and heaven above.{{sfn|Aune|2003|p=119}} Below the earth were the "waters of chaos", the cosmic sea, home to mythic monsters defeated and slain by God; in Exodus 20:4, God warns against making an image "of anything that is in the waters under the earth".{{sfn|Wright|2002|p=53}} There were also waters above the earth, and so the ''raqia'' ([[firmament]]), a solid bowl, was necessary to keep them from flooding the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ryken et al|1998|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Hellenistic period this was largely replaced by a more "scientific" model as imagined by Greek philosophers, according to which the earth was a sphere at the centre of concentric shells of celestial spheres containing the sun, moon, stars and planets.{{sfn|Aune|2003|p=119}}

The idea that God created the world out of nothing (''creatio [[ex nihilo]]'') is central today to Islam, Christianity, and Judaism – indeed, the medieval Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]] felt it was the only concept that the three religions shared{{sfn|Soskice|2010|p=24}} – yet it is not found directly in Genesis, nor in the entire Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Nebe|2002|p=119}} The Priestly authors of Genesis 1 were concerned not with the origins of matter (the material which God formed into the habitable cosmos), but with assigning roles so that the Cosmos should function.{{sfn|Walton|2006|p=183}} This was still the situation in the early 2nd century AD, although early Christian scholars were beginning to see a tension between the idea of world-formation and the omnipotence of God; by the beginning of the 3rd century this tension was resolved, world-formation was overcome, and creation ''ex nihilo'' had become a fundamental tenet of Christian theology.{{sfn|May|2004|p=179}}

'''Geniscus''' is a deity who appears in a [[homily|sermon]] of [[Saint Eligius]] along with [[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]], [[Orcus]], [[Minerva]] and [[Diana (goddess)|Diana]].  These are all, the [[Homiletics|Christian homilist]] says, "[[Christian demonology|demons]]" who should not be believed in or invoked.&lt;ref&gt;''Vita Eligii'' 9 (c. 700–724), ''MGH SRM'' 4: 705–706, as cited by Bernadotte Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals, Superstitions and Popular Cultures in Early Medieval Pastoral Literature'' (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 2005), p. 78. English translation by Jo Ann McNamara of [[Audoin (bishop)|Dado of Rouen]]'s ''Life of St. Eligius of Noyon'' in ''Medieval Hagiography: An Anthology'' (Routledge, 2001), pp. 137–168, with reference to Geniscus p. 157 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDD_0GztLYkC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=Geniscus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=20#v=onepage&amp;q=Geniscus&amp;f=false online.] See also [[Mythology in the Low Countries#Saint Eligius|Mythology in the Low Countries]].&lt;/ref&gt; The warning implies [[Cult (religion)|cult]] activity for these deities in the northern parts of [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Gaul]] into the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

Geniscus may be a form of reference to the [[Genius (mythology)|Genius]], the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman]] [[tutelary deity]]; in Gaul, the Genius is often hooded (''[[Genius Cucullatus]]'') and appears either singly or in a group of three.&lt;ref&gt;Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

In another sermon in the same period, the Geniscus appears in the company of witches (''[[Strix (mythology)|striae]]'') and other entities in whom "rustics" believe:&lt;ref&gt;Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals'', p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|There are some country people ''(rustici homines)'' who have a belief in certain women, because it is commonly said that they must be witches and able to harm infants and cattle, and the [[Dusios|Dusiolus]] or Aquatiquus&lt;ref&gt;''Aquatiquus'' from ''aqua'', the "Watery One."&lt;/ref&gt; or Geniscus must too.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunt aliqui rustici homines, qui credunt aliquas mulieres, quod vulgum dicitur strias esse debeant, et ad infantes vel pecora nocere possint, vel Dusiolus vel Aquatiquus, vel Geniscus debeant'' as quoted by [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]] in his 1678 ''Glossarium mediae et infimae latinitatis'' (Niort: Favre, 1883–1887), vol. 4, [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/GENISCUS online.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==19th century==
[[File:Lamia Waterhouse.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Pre-Raphaelite]] version of the ''lamia'' by [[John William Waterhouse]]]]
The 19th-century fascination for [[folklore]], [[antiquarianism]], the supernatural, and lost religions drew attention to even the obscure Geniscus. The Irish folklorist [[Thomas Crofton Croker]] accepted a [[etymology|derivation]] of ''geniscus'' from [[Latin]] ''genius'' and in his chapter on [[Elf|elves]] declared the ''geniscus'' "a real Elf, or spirit of light." Croker further connected ''geniscus'' to the ''geniciales feminae''&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Crofton Croker]], ''Fairy Legends and Traditions of the South of Ireland'' (London, 1828), p. 127 [https://books.google.com/books?id=AlLI-MR1vdEC&amp;pg=RA1-PA127&amp;dq=Geniscus&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Geniscus&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt; named by [[Hincmar]], a 9th-century  [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|archbishop of Reims]], who identified the ''geniciales'' as ''[[Lamia (mythology)|lamiae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hincmar]], ''[[De divortio|De divortio Lotharii]]'' ("On [[Lothair II of Lotharingia|Lothar]]'s divorce"), XV Interrogatio, ''MGH Concilia 4 Supplementum'', 205, as cited by Filotas, ''Pagan Survivals'', p. 305. In compiling his 1628 ''Glossarium'', [[Charles du Fresne, sieur du Cange|Du Cange]] made note of the ''geniciales feminae'', and although he appears to have associated them with words pertaining to generation and genitalia, he makes no explicit connection to Geniscus; see entry on ''geniciales feminae'' [http://ducange.enc.sorbonne.fr/GENICIALES online.]&lt;/ref&gt; During the same period [[Jacob Grimm]] classed the ''geniciales'' among the "daemonic elvish beings, who appeared in woman's shape and did men kindnesses," and who participated in elf-dance: "To christian zealots all ''dancing'' appeared sinful and heathenish, and sure enough it often was derived from pagan rites, like other harmless pleasures and customs of the common people, who would not easily part with their diversion at great festivals." Grimm connects these dances to [[bonfires]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob Grimm]] ''Teutonic Mythology'' (London, 1883), vol. 3, p. 1056 [https://books.google.com/books?id=OREVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1056&amp;dq=geniciales+Hincmar+OR+Hincmarus+OR+Hincmar&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=geniciales%20Hincmar%20OR%20Hincmarus%20OR%20Hincmar&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Geniscus is mentioned in the 1876 [[historical fiction]] ''Dante and Beatrice from 1282 to 1290: A Romance'' by [[Elizabeth Kerr Coulson]], writing under the pseudonym Roxburghe Lothian. Coulson recounts at length the Christian prohibitions that a [[friar]] called [[Hermit|The Hermit]] must enforce, then segues into practices deemed tolerable:

{{cquote|He had to stop people from keeping the day of rats and mice;&lt;ref&gt;This reference requires elucidation; perhaps Coulson means the [[Normandy|Norman]] agricultural rite when animals injurious to crops were exorcized during the season of [[Advent]]; children brandished torches through the fields and chanted ''Mice, caterpillars and moles, / Get out, get out of my field; / I will burn you beard and bones. / Trees and shrubs, / Give me bushels of apples''; see ''Encyclopaedia of Superstitions, Folklore, and the Occult Sciences of the World'' (Chicago, 1903), vol. 3, p. 1479 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ns0gK0efOvYC&amp;pg=PA1479&amp;dq=%22In+Normandy,+it+was+formerly+the+custom%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22In%20Normandy%2C%20it%20was%20formerly%20the%20custom%22&amp;f=false  online.] But this is conjecture, and a number of other rites or occasions may be meant; the [[Pied Piper of Hamelin]] may also come to mind.&lt;/ref&gt; a day which, with many similar remnants of [[paganism]], the [[Christian Church|Church]] had forbidden, although she had been pleased to appoint Saint [[Gertrude of Nivelles|Gertrude of Nivelle]], as the [[patron saint|patroness]] of their destruction. He was also bound to decry the old [[wikt:reverence|reverence]] for [[Fraxinus excelsior|ash trees]],&lt;ref&gt;See also [[World tree]], [[Tree of life]], [[Maypole]], [[Tree worship]], [[Yggdrasil]], [[Thor's oak]], [[Irminsul]], and [[Sacred tree at Uppsala]].&lt;/ref&gt; which reverence was a relic of the [[Midsummer|pagan Solstitia]]. He would tolerate no [[St John's Eve#Ireland|June fires]], on the [[St John's Eve|even of St John]], neither any dancing around them. But, on the other hand, there were minor customs of the lowliest of the poor which he tolerated. Such were the lighting of small [[wikt:cresset|cressets]] to float on streams and fountains, to prevent their drying up (which same were of old offerings to the [[Naiads]] and [[Potamides (mythology)|Potamides]]&lt;ref&gt;Daughters of [[wikt:ποταμός|Potamus]] ("River").&lt;/ref&gt;); hanging of wreaths of [[Verbena#Vervains in human culture|vervain]] round the necks of beasts to keep [[Vipera berus|adder]]s from them; placing of sprigs of [[buxus|box]] over cottage doors; wearing pieces of [[amber]] for Minerva, and strange [[amulet]]s against Ouragus,&lt;ref&gt;Coulson's source for this form of the [[theonym]] Orcus is unclear.&lt;/ref&gt; the old god of death, and his helper '''Geniscus'''; treasuring of red pebbles, found in the marsh-lands, in [[Lapwing|lap-wings]]' nests. These, and many more customs of the same kind, he found ineradicable, and was fain to tolerate patiently.&lt;ref&gt;[[Elizabeth Kerr Coulson]] writing as Roxburghe Lothian, ''Dante and Beatrice from 1282 to 1290: A Romance'' (London, 1876), vol. 1, pp. 117–118; full text [https://books.google.com/books?id=4voBAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:Elizabeth+inauthor:Kerr+inauthor:Coulson&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;num=100&amp;as_brr=1&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false downloadable.]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Whether she used the ''Vita'' of St. Eligius directly or another source such as Croker, Coulson preserves the collocation of Geniscus with Minerva and Orcus (here Ouragus&lt;ref&gt;This is a rather learned allusion on the part of the author, as ''Uragus'' is a form given by [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]] as the original from which Orcus derived; see ''Actes del IXè Simposi de la Secció Catalana de la SEEC St. Feliu de Guíxols, 13–16 d'abril de 1988: Treballs en honor de Virgilio Bejarano'' (Barcelona, 1991), p. 186 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2WdGEJF3A2YC&amp;pg=PA186&amp;dq=%22Orcus+proviene+de+Uragus%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Orcus%20proviene%20de%20Uragus%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;). She either innovates or draws on traditions pertaining to the cult of the ''Genii'' by making Geniscus the "helper" of Orcus.

'''Ghisha Koenig''' (8 December 1921 - 15 October 1993) was a British sculptor whose work focused on the work place, especially factories as a hub of human activity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.serpentinegalleries.org/exhibitions-events/ghisha-koenig-sculpture-1968-1986|title=Ghisha Koenig: Sculpture 1968-1986|website=Serpentine Galleries|access-date=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Growing up Asian in Australia''''' is an anthology of personal accounts, essays, short stories and poetry edited by [[Alice Pung]]. The discourse of "Asians" in Australia is similar to that in America and usually includes people of East Asian "[[oriental]]" background such as [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] or [[Koreans]]. However, in this anthology the term "Asian" extends to people from Indian and Pakistani backgrounds, which is more in line with the British use of the term "Asian".

Contributors include established authors such as [[Ken Chau]], [[Shaun Tan]], [[Simone Lazaroo]], [[Vanessa Woods]], television personalities such as [[Annette Shun Wah]], [[Kylie Kwong]], [[Dr Cindy Pan]] and emerging writers and poets of Asian descent. There are over 50 contributors.

''Growing up Asian in Australia'' is currently a set text for the VCE English context of Identity and belonging.

This is a list of lists by year of '''''[[The New York Times]]'' Non-Fiction Best Sellers'''.

[[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]] was first published without fanfare on October 12, 1931.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', October 12, 1931. 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=miller&gt;{{cite book |editor=Ezra Greenspan (editor)|title=[[Book History (journal)|Book History]] |volume=Volume Three |chapter=The Best-Seller List as Marketing Tool and Historical Fiction |author=Laura J.

A national list was created April 9, 1942 in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' (Sundays) as a supplement to the regular paper's city lists (Monday edition).&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; The national list ranked by weighting how many times the book appeared in each city list.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt; A few years later, the city lists were eliminated leaving only the national rankings, which was compiled according to "reports from leading booksellers in 22 cities," a system which remains essentially unchanged to this day (though the specifics have changed).&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;

A separate category for "Advice, How-To and Miscellaneous" books was created January 1, 1984. Its number one bestseller (''The Body Principal'' by Victoria Principal) had been number ten and number twelve on the non-fiction lists for the two preceding weeks.&lt;ref&gt;

It represents the overall proportions and shapes of the states of the United States and parts of Mexico and Canada, although executed with a more "energetic application of paint"&lt;ref name="moma"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=79372 Museum of Modern Art, New York City]&lt;/ref&gt; than found in [[cartography]].  The names of the states and ocean areas are [[stencil]]led.

The painting measures {{convert|198.2|cm}} by {{convert|314.7|cm}}.  Johns was inspired by a gift from [[Robert Rauschenberg]] of some [[mimeograph]]ed outline maps of [[US states]], of the sort that can be colored in by schoolchildren.  Johns was attracted to an image that is ubiquitous but "seen and not looked at, not examined",&lt;ref name="moma"/&gt; effectively a [[found object]].  He copied the outlines to a large canvas, to which he added bright splashes of red, yellow, and blue, sometimes mixed, with accents of black and white.  His rough brushwork resembles an [[Abstract Expressionist]] style or the late works of [[Cézanne]].  Although the outlines of the states are recognisable, the colors do not always respect state borders, perhaps suggesting the blurring of boundaries and homogenisation of post-war American society, reinforced by the mass-produced effect of the stencilled names.  It has been suggested that the painting may be a visual pun, as Johns "deliberately put American painting on the map" in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Lanchner, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;  Johns considered that he was painting a map, not making a painting ''of'' a map.

The painting was donated by Mr. and Mrs. [[Robert C. Scull]] to the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City. Johns continued to make map paintings through the 1960s, including gray versions in 1962 and 1963, a white map in 1965, and a monumental mural {{convert|33|ft}} wide and {{convert|15|ft}} high for [[Expo 67]] in Montreal.  Other map paintings by Johns employ [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]] in place of [[oil paint]]

The '''Marvel Cinematic Universe''' ('''MCU''') is an American [[media franchise]] and [[shared universe]] that is centered on a [[film series|series]] of [[superhero film]]s, independently produced by [[Marvel Studios]] and based on characters that appear in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The franchise has expanded to include comic books, short films, television series, and digital series. The shared universe, much like the original [[Marvel Universe]] in comic books, was established by [[fictional crossover|crossing over]] common plot elements, settings, cast, and characters. [[Phil Coulson]], portrayed by [[Clark Gregg]], is an original character to the MCU and the only character to appear across all its different media.

The first film released in the MCU was ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' (2008), which began the first phase of films culminating in the crossover film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]'' (2012). Phase Two began with ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013), and concluded with ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' (2015). The films are currently in Phase Three, which began with the release of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016) and is set to conclude with an [[untitled Avengers film]] (2019). [[Marvel Television]] expanded the universe further, first to network television with ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] in the [[2013–14 United States network television schedule|2013–14 television season]], followed by [[Streaming media|online streaming]] with ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Marvel's Daredevil]]'' on [[Netflix]] in [[2015 in American television#Television programs|2015]] and ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' on [[Hulu]] in [[2017 in American television#Television programs|2017]], and then to [[cable television]] with ''[[Cloak &amp; Dagger (TV series)|Marvel's Cloak &amp; Dagger]]'' on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] in [[2018 in American television#Television programs|2018]]. Marvel Television has also produced the digital series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot]]'', which is a supplement to ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D''. [[Film score|Soundtrack albums]] have been released for all of the films, along with many of the television series, as well as the release of [[compilation album]]s containing existing music heard in the films. The MCU also includes [[Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-in comics|tie-in comics]] published by Marvel Comics, while Marvel Studios has also produced a series of [[Marvel One-Shots|direct-to-video short films]] and a [[viral marketing]] campaign for its films and the universe with the faux news program ''[[WHIH Newsfront]]''.

The franchise has been commercially successful as a multimedia shared universe, though some critics have found that some of its films and television series have suffered in service of the wider universe. It has inspired other film and television studios with comic book character adaptation rights to attempt to create similar shared universes. The MCU has also been the focus of other media, outside of the shared universe, including attractions at various [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], an attraction at [[Discovery Times Square]], a [[Queensland Gallery of Modern Art]] exhibit, two television specials, guidebooks for each film, multiple tie-in video games, and commercials.

===Films===
{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote="It's never been done before and that's kind of the spirit everybody's taking it in. The other filmmakers aren't used to getting actors from other movies that other filmmakers have cast, certain plot lines that are connected or certain locations that are connected, but I think ... everyone was on board for it and thinks that it's fun. Primarily because we've always remained consistent saying that the movie that we are making comes first. All of the connective tissue, all of that stuff is fun and is going to be very important if you want it to be. If the fans want to look further and find connections, then they're there. There are a few big ones obviously, that hopefully the mainstream audience will able to follow as well. But ... the reason that all the filmmakers are on board is that their movies need to stand on their own. They need to have a fresh vision, a unique tone, and the fact that they can interconnect if you want to follow those breadcrumbs is a bonus."|source=—[[Kevin Feige]], President of Production for Marvel Studios, on constructing a shared film universe.&lt;ref name="FiegeQuote" /&gt;}}

By 2005, [[Marvel Entertainment]] began planning to independently produce its own films and distribute them through [[Paramount Pictures]].&lt;ref name="Variety2005" /&gt; Previously, Marvel had [[co-production (film)|co-produced]] [[Marvel Studios#Co-productions|several superhero films]] with [[Columbia Pictures]], [[New Line Cinema]] and others, including a seven-year development deal with [[20th Century Fox]].&lt;ref name="Variety2006" /&gt; Marvel made relatively little profit from its licensing deals with other studios and wanted to get more money out of its films while maintaining artistic control of the projects and distribution.&lt;ref name="June2007NYTimes" /&gt; [[Avi Arad]], head of Marvel's film division, was pleased with [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|Sam Raimi's Spider-Man films]] at Sony, but was less pleased about others. As a result, they decided to form [[Marvel Studios]], Hollywood's first major [[independent film|independent]] movie studio since [[DreamWorks]].&lt;ref name="BloombergPg3" /&gt;

Arad's second-in-command,&lt;ref name="BloombergPg3" /&gt; [[Kevin Feige]], realized that unlike [[Spider-Man]] and the [[X-Men]], whose film rights were licensed to Sony and Fox, respectively, Marvel still owned the rights to the core members of the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. Feige, a self-professed "fanboy", envisioned creating a shared universe just as creators [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] had done with their comic books in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="BostonApril2012" /&gt; To raise capital, the studio secured funding from a seven-year, $525&amp;nbsp;million revolving credit facility with [[Merrill Lynch]].&lt;ref name="June2007NYTimes" /&gt; Marvel's plan was to release individual films for their main characters and then merge them in a [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] film.&lt;ref name="CinematicalCrossover" /&gt; Arad, who doubted the strategy yet insisted that it was his reputation that helped secure the initial financing, resigned the following year.&lt;ref name="BloombergPg3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyMarsMay2014" /&gt;

[[File:Kevin Feige - Guardians of the Galaxy premiere - July 2014 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Kevin Feige helped conceive of a shared media universe of Marvel properties.]]
In 2007, at 33 years old, Feige was named studio chief. In order to preserve its artistic integrity, Marvel Studios formed a creative committee of six people familiar with its comic book lore: Feige, Marvel Studios co-president Louis D'Esposito, Marvel Comics' president of publishing [[Dan Buckley]], Marvel's chief creative officer [[Joe Quesada]], writer [[Brian Michael Bendis]], and Marvel Entertainment president [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], who oversaw the committee.&lt;ref name="BloombergPg3" /&gt; Feige initially referred to the shared narrative continuity of these films as the "Marvel Cinema Universe",&lt;ref name="FeigeCinemaUniverse" /&gt; but later used the term "Marvel Cinematic Universe".&lt;ref name="FeigeCinematicUniverse" /&gt; Marvel has designated the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Earth-199999 within the [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of the company's [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]], a collection of fictional alternate universes.&lt;ref name="Earth-199999" /&gt;

In November 2013, Feige said that "in an ideal world" releases each year would include one film based on an existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it's "a nice rhythm" in that format. While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' and ''Thor: The Dark World'', he said it is "certainly something to aim for."&lt;ref name="SlashFilmNov2013" /&gt; Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, "I don't know that we'll keep to [that model] ''every'' year", but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, "so I think it would be fun to continue that sort of thing."&lt;ref name="FeigeIGNJuly2014" /&gt; In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the "rhythm" that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like "a big [[Events from the Modern Age of Comic Books|event]] or [[Fictional crossover#Comics|crossover]] series,"&lt;ref name="IGNFeb2014" /&gt; with ''Avengers'' films acting as "big, giant linchpins."&lt;ref name="BuzzFeed" /&gt; After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014,&lt;ref name="MCU2019" /&gt; Feige stated, "I think if you look at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [existing] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going."&lt;ref name="FeigeCBRJuly2014" /&gt; After the titles were revealed in October 2014,&lt;ref name="Oct2014Event" /&gt; Feige said, "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [in 2017 and 2018] instead of just two, without changing our methods."&lt;ref name="Oct2014EventQA" /&gt;

On expanding the characters in the universe and letting individual films breathe and work on their own, as opposed to having Avenger team-ups outside of ''Avengers'' films, Feige stated, it's about "teaching the general movie-going audience about the notion of the characters existing separately, coming together for specific events and going away and existing separately in their own worlds again. Just like comic readers have been doing for decades and decades ... people sort of are accepting that there's just a time when they should be together and there's a time when they're not."&lt;ref name="IGNMar2014pg4" /&gt; In April 2014, Feige revealed that [[Edgar Wright]]'s pitch for ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' in 2006 helped shape the early films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, saying, "We changed, frankly, some of the MCU to accommodate this version of [[Ant-Man]]. Knowing what we wanted to do with Edgar and with Ant-Man, going years and years back, helped to dictate what we did with the roster for ''Avengers'' the first time. It was a bit of both in terms of his idea for the Ant-Man story influencing the birth of the MCU in the early films leading up to ''Avengers''."&lt;ref name="RamaApril2014" /&gt;

In October 2014, Marvel held a press event to announce the titles of their Phase Three films.&lt;ref name="Oct2014Event" /&gt; The event, which drew comparisons to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|Worldwide Developers Conference]],&lt;ref name="Oct2014EventApple" /&gt; was done because all the information was ready. As Feige explained, "We wanted to do this at [[San Diego Comic-Con International|[San Diego] Comic-Con]] this year. Things were not set ... So the plan has been, since a few weeks before Comic-Con when we realized we weren't going to be able to do everything we wanted to do, is to decide 'let's do either something we haven't done in a long time, or something we've never done.' Which is a singular event, just to announce what we have when it's ready. I thought that might be early August, or mid-September, it ended up being [at the end of October]."&lt;ref name="Oct2014EventQA" /&gt;

By September 2015, after Marvel Studios was integrated into [[Walt Disney Studios (division)|The Walt Disney Studios]] with Feige reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman [[Alan F. Horn|Alan Horn]] instead of Marvel Entertainment CEO [[Isaac Perlmutter]],&lt;ref name="MarvelDisneyAug2015" /&gt; the studios' creative committee had "nominal" input on the films moving forward, though they continued to consult on [[Marvel Television]] productions, which remained under Perlmutter's control.&lt;ref name="CreativeCommitteeEnd" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CreativeCommittee2" /&gt; All key film decisions going forward will be made by Feige, D'Esposito and Victoria Alonso.&lt;ref name="CreativeCommitteeEnd" /&gt; At the end of the month, on how much story is developed for future films of the universe, Feige said there are "broad strokes" though sometime "super-specific things. But for the most part, in broad strokes that are broad enough and loose enough that, if through the development of four of five movies before we get to the culmination ... we still have room to sway and to move and to go and to surprise ourselves in places that we end up. So that all the movies, hopefully when they're finished, will feel like they're all interconnected and meant to be and planned far ahead, but really can live and breathe enough as individual movies to be satisfying each and of themselves." The studio also has various contingency plans for the direction of all of their films, in the event they are unable to secure a certain actor to reprise a role, or re-acquire the film rights to a character, such as was done in February 2015 with [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref name="FeigeSep2015" /&gt;

In April 2016, on moving the universe to Phase Four and reflecting on the first three, Feige said, "I think there will be a finality to moments of Phase Three, as well as new beginnings that will mark a different, a {{em|very}} different, a distinctively different chapter in what will someday be a complete first saga made up of three phases." Joe Russo added, "You build things up and people enjoy the experiences you've built up. But then you kind of reach an apex or you reach a climax, a moment where you go, 'This structure is really going to start to be repetitious if we do this again, so what do we do now?' So now, you deconstruct it. We're in the deconstruction phase with ''[[Captain America: Civil War|[Captain America:] Civil War]]'' and leading into ''[[Avengers: Infinity War|[Avengers:] Infinity War]]'', which are the culmination films."&lt;ref name="FeigePhaseFour" /&gt; A year later, Feige felt after the conclusion of Phase Three, Marvel might abandon grouping the films by phases, saying, "it might be a new thing."&lt;ref name="FeigeColliderApr2017" /&gt; Feige also mentioned that the [[Untitled Avengers film]] would provide "a definitive end" to the films and storylines preceding it, with the franchise having "two distinct periods. Everything before ''Avengers 4'' and everything after."&lt;ref name="VanityFairNov2017" /&gt;

On the potential for "superhero fatigue", Feige stated, "This year [2016], we've got ''Civil War'' and we've got ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'' in November, two completely different movies. To me, and to all of Marvel Studios, that's what keeps it going. As long as we're surprising people, as long as we're not falling into things becoming too similar ... next year, [''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]''], [''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''], ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]''. Those are three totally different movies ... as long as the only shared thing is they come from the same source material and they've got our Marvel logo in front of the movies. Other than that they can be very distinct. What other studios do, what other properties, nothing we can do about it."&lt;ref name="FeigeFatigueApr2016" /&gt;

In December 2017, [[The Walt Disney Company]] [[Proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|agreed to acquire assets]] from [[21st Century Fox]], including 20th Century Fox, for $52.4&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="FoxDisneyPressRelease" /&gt; The following June, after a counter offer from [[Comcast]] worth $65&amp;nbsp;billion, Disney increased its offer to $71.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="DisneyFoxBidIncrease" /&gt; The acquisition would see the return of the film rights to [[Deadpool]], and the X-Men and [[Fantastic Four]] characters to Marvel Studios, which would "create richer, more complex worlds of inter-related characters and stories."&lt;ref name="FoxDisneyPressRelease" /&gt;

====Distributors====
Over time, the [[Film distribution|distribution rights]] to Marvel Studios' films changed hands on multiple occasions. In November 2006, [[Universal Studios|Universal Pictures]] announced that it would distribute ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'',&lt;ref name="HulkUniversal" /&gt; in an arrangement separate from Marvel's 2005 deal with Paramount, which was distributing Marvel's other films.&lt;ref name="Variety2005" /&gt; In September 2008, after the international success of ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', Paramount signed a deal to have worldwide distribution rights for ''[[Iron Man 2]]'', ''Iron Man 3'', ''Thor'', ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', and ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''.&lt;ref name="ParamountInternational" /&gt;

In late December 2009, The Walt Disney Company purchased Marvel Entertainment for $4&amp;nbsp;billion. Additionally, in October 2010, Walt Disney Studios bought the distribution rights for ''The Avengers'' and ''Iron Man 3'' from Paramount Pictures,&lt;ref name="DisneyAvengersIM3" /&gt; with Paramount's logo remaining on the films, as well as for promotional material and merchandise,&lt;ref name="ParamountLogo1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ParamountLogo2" /&gt; although [[Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures]] is the only studio credited at the end of these films.&lt;ref name="VarietyParamount" /&gt; Disney has distributed all subsequent Marvel Studios films.&lt;ref name="DisneyPurchase" /&gt; In July 2013, Disney purchased the distribution rights to ''Iron Man'', ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor'' and ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' from Paramount.&lt;ref name="DisneyDistribution" /&gt; ''The Incredible Hulk'' was not part of the deal, due to an agreement between Marvel and Universal, where Marvel owns the film rights and Universal owns the distribution rights, for this film as well as the [[right of first refusal]] to distribute future [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] films.&lt;ref name="HulkRights" /&gt; According to ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', a potential reason why Marvel has not bought the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts|theme park]] rights to several Marvel characters that Disney wants for its own [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|theme parks]].&lt;ref name="HulkRights2" /&gt;

In February 2015, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] and Marvel Studios announced a licensing deal that would allow Spider-Man to appear in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with the character first appearing in ''Captain America: Civil War''.&lt;ref name="SpideyMCU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WSJSpidey" /&gt; Marvel Studios also explored opportunities to integrate other characters of the Marvel Cinematic Universe into future ''Spider-Man'' films financed, distributed, and controlled by Sony Pictures,&lt;ref name="SpideyMCU" /&gt; with [[Robert Downey Jr.]] the first confirmed to reprise his role as [[Iron Man|Tony Stark / Iron Man]] in ''Spider-Man: Homecoming''.&lt;ref name="DowneySMH" /&gt; In June 2015, Feige clarified that the initial Sony deal does not apply to the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|MCU television series]], as it was "very specific ... with a certain amount of back and forth allowed."&lt;ref name="SpideyDealClarified" /&gt; Both studios have the ability to terminate the agreement at any point, and no money was exchanged with the deal. However, a small adjustment was made to a 2011 deal formed between the two studios (where Marvel gained full control of Spider-Man's merchandising rights, in exchange for making a one-time payment of $175&amp;nbsp;million to Sony and paying up to $35&amp;nbsp;million for each future Spider-Man film, and forgoing receiving their previous 5% of any Spider-Man film's revenue), with Marvel getting to reduce their $35&amp;nbsp;million payment to Sony if ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' grossed more than $750 million.&lt;ref name="WSJDealNumbers" /&gt;

===Television===
[[File:Jeph Loeb at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Head of Marvel Television [[Jeph Loeb]] serves as executive producer on every television series set in the universe.|alt=Jeph Loeb sitting.]]

====Broadcast====
In June 2010, [[Marvel Television]] was launched with [[Jeph Loeb]] as head.&lt;ref name="TVLaunch" /&gt; By July 2012, the division had entered into discussions with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to create a show set in the MCU,&lt;ref name="July2012TVshow" /&gt; and in August, ABC ordered a [[Television pilot|pilot]] for a show called ''S.H.I.E.L.D.'', with ''The Avengers'' writer/director [[Joss Whedon]] involved;&lt;ref name="DeadlineSHIELDPilot" /&gt; it was later renamed ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]''&lt;ref name="Apr2013ABCAllAccess" /&gt; In January 2014, the series ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Marvel's Agent Carter]]'' was announced, joining ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' at ABC,&lt;ref name="AtwellAgentCarterTV"/&gt; while a [[put pilot]] order for the half-hour live-action comedy series, ''Marvel's Damage Control'', was revealed in October 2015.&lt;ref name="DamageControl" /&gt; While talking about Marvel potentially making comedy series, Loeb said in January 2016 that Marvel always feels humor should be a part of anything they produce, despite possibly fitting more within a darker genre, as ''Daredevil'' and ''Jessica Jones'' do, while also staying "grounded and real". He added, "There are moments of levity that are in life that you need to bring to the table, or else it just becomes overwhelmingly oppressive ... If you're going to [explore comic book elements], it's always a good idea to make sure that the audience is aware that, yeah, it's funny [too]."&lt;ref name="LoebComediesCBJan2016" /&gt;

In May 2016, after ABC had canceled ''Agent Carter'' and passed on ''[[Most Wanted (TV pilot)|Marvel's Most Wanted]]'', [[ABC Entertainment]] president [[Channing Dungey]] said that Marvel and ABC were working together, looking "at series that would be beneficial to both brands" moving forward.&lt;ref name="DungeyMay2016" /&gt; In November 2016, Marvel and [[IMAX Corporation]] announced ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Marvel's Inhumans]]'', based on the species [[Inhumans|of the same name]], after a planned film based on the characters had been removed from Marvel Studios' slate.&lt;ref name="InhumansAnnouncement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InhumansAnnouncement2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InhumansNoThe" /&gt; The first two episodes of the series were set to premiere in [[IMAX]] theaters in September 2017 for two weeks, before airing on ABC with the remainder of the series.&lt;ref name="InhumansAnnouncement" /&gt; [[Ben Sherwood]], president of [[Disney–ABC Television Group]], said, "We've worked very carefully with our friends at Marvel Studios—and this is a critical point—to make sure that calendar-wise and content-wise we are only enhancing" the MCU; the theatrical debut of the series was timed to not interfere with the release of any Marvel Studios films—the theatrical run of the series will take place between the releases of ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'' and ''Thor: Ragnarok''.&lt;ref name="InhumansAnnouncement3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="InhumansTHR2" /&gt; The deal was initially suggested to Marvel by IMAX after they had held a successful IMAX event with ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' in 2015. Sherwood described it as "a quadruple win—a win for IMAX, a win for Marvel, a win for ABC Studios and a win for ABC to launch a show in an innovative way and get attention" in an increasingly crowded market. Sherwood hoped that this would be the first of "several innovative ways to launch [television] programming."&lt;ref name="InhumansTHR2" /&gt;

====Online streaming====
=====Netflix=====
By October 2013, Marvel was preparing four drama series and a miniseries, totaling 60 episodes, to present to [[video on demand]] services and cable providers, with [[Netflix]], [[Amazon Instant Video|Amazon]], and [[WGN America]] expressing interest.&lt;ref name="DeadlineTVOct2013" /&gt; In November 2013, Disney was set to provide Netflix with live-action series based on [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Jessica Jones]], [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]], and [[Luke Cage]], leading up to a miniseries based on the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].&lt;ref name="DeadlineTVNov2013" /&gt; Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] stated that Netflix was chosen to air the shows, "when Disney realized it could use the streaming service as a way to grow the popularity of the characters". He added that, if the characters prove popular, they could become feature films.&lt;ref name="VarietyTVNov2013" /&gt; Loeb later stated that Marvel was not "interested in making four pilots and then hoping someday that they could all get together. Netflix really understood what it is we wanted to do. They're very open to directors that might not have that same opportunity in broadcast television. The notion of having all 13 episodes at one time, particularly in serialized storytelling, is very appealing."&lt;ref name="LoebJan2017" /&gt; Loeb also added that the four characters chosen "all had a previous existing relationship and all grew up on the same kind of stoop in New York [in the comics]. So it lent itself to a world. Does that mean these shows are going to be the same? No. They can't be. The characters have different issues, different problems, different feelings about them ... the example that I continually give is that I cannot think of two films that are more different in tone than ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier|The Winter Soldier]]'' and ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''. And yet, if you watch them back to back, they feel very Marvel. They feel very much like, 'Oh, it is still the same universe that I'm in.'"&lt;ref name="IGNApr2015" /&gt;

Quesada confirmed in April 2014 that the Netflix series would be set within the MCU.&lt;ref name="QuesadaNetflix" /&gt; Loeb explained that "Within the Marvel universe there are thousands of heroes of all shapes and sizes, but the Avengers are here to save the universe and Daredevil is here to save the neighborhood ... It does take place in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It's all connected. But that doesn't necessarily mean that we would look up in the sky and see [Iron Man]. It's just a different part of New York that we have not yet seen in the Marvel movies."&lt;ref name="EW7ThingsDD" /&gt; In January 2015, Netflix COO [[Ted Sarandos]] said Netflix planned to release a Marvel series approximately a year apart from each other after ''Daredevil''{{'}}s April 2015 release.&lt;ref name="NetflixReleasePlans" /&gt; A year later, Sarandos noted that the release schedules of the Marvel Netflix series are dependent on the "long production times and long post times. In some cases, when we have characters crossover, it makes it more difficult to manage production. It's not the goal to put out more than one or two [each] year ... The complex one is really ''The Defenders''. ''The Defenders''{{'}} production schedule will determine a lot of the season 2 and 3 output of those shows." He also noted on potential spin-offs that "all the characters in the universe could also spin out" into their own series at some point,&lt;ref name="SarandosJan2016" /&gt; with Netflix ordering ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|Marvel's The Punisher]]'', a spin-off from ''Daredevil'', that April.&lt;ref name="PunisherEWApr2016" /&gt; Sarandos later stated that Netflix was trying to close the gap between releases of Marvel seasons, but would always prioritize the quality of the series over higher numbers of releases per year. He also said that Netflix was open to exploring the MCU beyond the ''Defenders'' series, including potential crossovers with ABC's Marvel series.&lt;ref name="SarandosJuly2016" /&gt; In July 2016, Marvel and Netflix committed to complete production on 135 episodes by the end of 2017, making the deal the largest television production commitment in New York State. Production for the different series had engaged 500 local vendors and small businesses for various stages of development, and had required over 14,000 production-related hires.&lt;ref name="Netflix135" /&gt;

In October 2018, Netflix canceled ''Iron Fist'' after two seasons, with ''Deadline Hollywood'' reporting that Disney was considering reviving the series on its streaming service [[Disney+]].&lt;ref name="IFCanceledDeadline" /&gt; Sarandos confirmed that the series were Netflix's to renew or cancel if they wished, and the company was "super happy with [the other series'] performance so far".&lt;ref name="SarandosNoCancelling" /&gt; Despite this, ''Luke Cage'' was canceled by the streamer a week after ''Iron Fist'' was. ''Deadline Hollywood'' reported there were no plans to revive the series on Disney+ as with ''Iron Fist''.&lt;ref name="LCCanceled" /&gt; Shortly after, at the end of November 2018, Netflix canceled ''Daredevil'' after three seasons, with ''Deadline Hollywood'' again reporting there was the potential for the series to be revived on Disney+.&lt;ref name="DDCanceled" /&gt; Conversely, ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt it was unlikely the series would be revived on Disney+ and also noted the two other remaining series at the time (''Jessica Jones'' and ''The Punisher'') would remain on Netflix "until they run their course".&lt;ref name="DDCanceledTHR" /&gt;

=====Hulu=====
In August 2016, Marvel announced that ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Marvel's Runaways]]'' had received a pilot order from [[Hulu]],&lt;ref name="RunawaysHulu2" /&gt; eventually receiving a 10 episode order the following May.&lt;ref name="RunawaysSeriesOrder" /&gt; That July, Loeb confirmed the series would take place in the MCU saying, "It all lives in the same world, how it's connected and where it's connected and what it's going to be connected to remains to be seen." He added that the characters would not be concerned with the actions of other in the universe, instead focusing on their own issues. This allowed showrunners [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]] to deal with concepts such as superheroics and fantasy without explaining them to the audience, since they are already well established in the MCU, while still focusing on their own characters, which they described as "liberating".&lt;ref name="RunawaysMCU" /&gt;

=====Disney+=====
By November 2017, Disney was looking to develop a new Marvel television series for their streaming service [[Disney+]].&lt;ref name="DisneyStreaming2" /&gt; In July 2018, Feige noted discussions had begun with Disney regarding any potential involvement Marvel Studios could have with the streaming service, since Feige felt the service was "an important thing for the company".&lt;ref name="FeigeStreamingServiceJul2018" /&gt; In September 2018, it was reported that Marvel Studios was developing several limited series centered on "second tier" characters from the MCU films who had not and were unlikely to star in their own films. Each series was expected to be six to eight episodes, and would be produced by Marvel Studios rather than Marvel Television, with Feige taking a "hands-on role" in each series' development.&lt;ref name="Disney+SeriesSep2018" /&gt; Feige noted the series being developed for the streaming service would "tell stories... that we wouldn't be able to tell in a theatrical experience — a longer-form narrative".&lt;ref name="FeigeStreamingTHRNov2018" /&gt;

====Cable====
In April 2016, the ABC-owned [[Cable television|cable]] network [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] announced ''[[Cloak &amp; Dagger (TV series)|Marvel's Cloak &amp; Dagger]]'', based on the characters [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|of the same name]], with a straight-to-series order for 2018.&lt;ref name="CloakandDaggerApr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CDAiring" /&gt; The network confirmed that the series would be "its first venture into the Marvel Cinematic Universe", and described the show as a "superhero love story", a premise that ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called "a seamless fit for Freeform" given the network's target audience of "Becomers" (the 14–34 age demographic).&lt;ref name="CloakandDaggerApr2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CloakandDaggerMCU" /&gt; This younger-skewing content was continued with the comedy series ''[[New Warriors (TV series)|Marvel's New Warriors]]'' ordered in April 2017, with Freeform executive Karey Burke saying, Marvel "started to see our strength with young adults and together we could create a pipeline for content that was specific to our audience that felt younger than what they're doing at the other channels... It was important to both of us to find the right characters that felt like they would speak directly to Freeform's audience. The Avengers wouldn't work here but the about-to-be-Avengers works here."&lt;ref name="NewWarriorsApril2017" /&gt; Loeb noted that it was "exciting" to Marvel "to be able to explore the world of the hero and how it affects someone who is trying to figure out who they are as opposed to already knows who they are and now their whole life has to take a left. That's the journey we're going on with these kinds of characters" in ''Cloak &amp; Dagger'', ''New Warriors'' and Hulu's ''Runaways''.&lt;ref name="TCAJul2017THR" /&gt; By November 2017, ''New Warriors'' was no longer set to air on Freeform and was being shopped to other networks.&lt;ref name="NWBeingShopped" /&gt;

====Crossovers to feature films====
{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=After [running something by Jeph] Loeb we'll run it through New York, Joe Quesada, Dan Buckley and those guys. [Then we] pitch our stuff to Kevin Feige and his movie group to see if there's something we can tie into, to see if they're okay about us using a character, or a weapon or some other cool thing. Everything is interconnected.|source=—''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executive producer Jeffrey Bell in September 2014, explaining the process of working in with the MCU&lt;ref name="BellSep2014" /&gt;}}
''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executive producer [[Jeffrey Bell]] revealed at the show's 2014 PaleyFest panel that the producers and writers are able to read the screenplays for upcoming MCU films to know where the universe is heading.&lt;ref name="AoSHitfixPg2" /&gt; He noted that since the films have to be "big" and move "quickly through a lot of huge pieces", it is beneficial for the films to have the television series fill in any "gaps" for them.&lt;ref name="BellPasteSep2015" /&gt; His fellow executive producer [[Jed Whedon]] explained that each Marvel project is intended to standalone first before there is any interweaving, and noted that the series has to be aware of the film division's plans so as not to interfere when introducing someone or something to the universe.&lt;ref name="AoSProducersTHR" /&gt; Bell said this was preferable so that people who do not watch the films can still follow the series, and vice versa.&lt;ref name="BellPasteSep2015" /&gt; Joss Whedon noted that this process "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." He stated that, for example, the series' creative team initially wanted to use [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s scepter from ''The Avengers'' but were unable due to his plans for it in ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.&lt;ref name="JossScepter" /&gt;

In April 2014, Quesada stated that, beyond connecting to themselves, the Netflix series would connect with the films and other television series.&lt;ref name="QuesadaNetflix" /&gt; In October 2014, Feige said the opportunity "certainly" exists for characters in the Netflix series to appear in ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.&lt;ref name="Oct2014EventQA" /&gt; In March 2015, Loeb spoke on the ability for the Netflix series to crossover with the films and the ABC series, saying, "As it is now, in the same way that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to ''The Avengers'', it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into ''Thor 2'' and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of ''Iron Man 3''. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling".&lt;ref name="LoebDigitalSpy" /&gt; In September 2015, Feige elaborated on the films referencing the television series, saying "I think that's inevitable at some point ... The schedules do not always quite match up to make that possible. It's easier for [the shows]. They're more nimble and faster and produce things quicker than we do, which is one of the main reasons you see the repercussions of ''Winter Soldier'' or [''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''] in the show ... by the time we start doing a movie, they'd be mid-way through a season. By the time our movie comes out, they'd be [starting the next season].&lt;!--This wording allows for it to apply to all seasons, not just the second and third--&gt; So finding the timing on that is not always easy."&lt;ref name="FeigeSep2015" /&gt;

Loeb talked further on the subject in July 2016, reiterating the issue of scheduling by saying "if I'm shooting a television series and that's going to go on over a six-month or eight-month period, how am I going to get [a television series actor] to be able to go be in a movie?" He noted that this would not be as much of an issue if characters were making very minor cameo appearances, but explained that Marvel was not interested in cameos and easter eggs just for the sake of fan service, which could detract from the story being told; "As I often get reported by you folks for saying #ItsAllConnected, our feeling is that the connection isn't just whether or not somebody is walking into a movie or walking out of a television show. It's connected in the way that the shows come from the same place, that they are real, that they are grounded."&lt;ref name="LoebJuly2016" /&gt; Eric Carroll, producer on ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'', felt with the introduction of [[Queens]]-based Spider-Man to the MCU it "would be really fun" to make mention of the Defenders based in Manhattan, adding, "it's definitely a card I would love to see played, if not sooner rather than later."&lt;ref name="HomecomingDefenders" /&gt;

In January 2017, [[Vincent D'Onofrio]], who portrays [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] in ''Daredevil'', said he "would love to switch over to the movies, but I think it's pretty much been said it's not going to happen. Or at least not for a very, very long time." D'Onofrio cited Feige's previous reasoning as well as the fact that the films already had difficulty "bringing big characters in that they have to service in the writing" and adding characters from the television series would be "just too many characters" since the films were "trying to figure out already how to individualize more and at the same time keep ''The Avengers'' going."&lt;ref name="DOnofrioJan2017" /&gt; In March 2017, [[Anthony Mackie]], who portrays [[Falcon (comics)|Sam Wilson / Falcon]] in the films, felt a crossover between the films and television series "wouldn't work at all" given they are "different universes, different worlds, different companies, different designs" and that "Kevin Feige is very specific about how he wants the Marvel Universe to be seen in the film world."&lt;ref name="MackieMar2017" /&gt; That May, Feige noted that a character appearing in a television series would not necessarily exclude them from appearing in a film, adding that "at some point, there's going to be a crossover. Crossover, repetition, or something."&lt;ref name="FeigeTVCharactersMay2017" /&gt; Regarding the potential for the Avengers to learn in the films that [[Phil Coulson]] is alive, Loeb stated, "It's certainly something that will get resolved, and it may get resolved in a very surprising way."&lt;ref name="CoulsonAliveFilms" /&gt;

Loeb said in July 2017 that Marvel Television had no plans for series to crossover across networks. Specifically for the similarly themed ''Cloak &amp; Dagger'', ''New Warriors'', and ''Runaways'', which all deal with young heroes, Loeb noted, "You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... things that are happening in L.A. [where ''Runaways'' is set] are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans [where ''Cloak &amp; Dagger'' is set]... It's being aware of it and trying to find a way for it to be able to discuss in a way that makes sense."&lt;ref name="TCAJul2017THR" /&gt; He added in October that scheduling of each series factors into why crossovers between them are more difficult to pull off, and that network "feelings" need to be considered. He also spoke on why the television series do not show [[Avengers Tower]] as it appears in the films when they depict New York City, and stated that Marvel Television wanted to be "less specific" about the television characters' relationships to the tower because that "helps the audience understand that this could be on any street corner" and that the characters could be in an area of the city where you would not be able to see the tower, even though it exists.&lt;ref name="LoebOct2017" /&gt;

In June 2018, speaking to how the MCU television series would be affected by the events of ''Avengers: Infinity War'', Loeb noted that "For the most part our stories will take place before Thanos clicked his fingers. A lot of that has to do with production and when we are telling our stories versus when the movies come out."&lt;ref name="LoebAMAJun2018" /&gt; In September 2018, with the report of Marvel Studios developing limited series for Disney's streaming service, it was expected that the actors that portrayed the characters in the films would portray them again for the limited series.&lt;ref name="Disney+SeriesSep2018" /&gt;

===Other media===
In 2008, the first official tie-in comic was released.&lt;ref name="FirstComic"/&gt; Quesada outlined his plan to expand the MCU into comic books, saying, "The MCU [comics] are going to be stories set within movie continuity. [They are] not necessarily direct adaptations of the movies, but maybe something that happened off screen and was mentioned in the movie ... Kevin Feige is involved with these and in some cases maybe the writers of the movies would be involved [as well.]"&lt;ref name="QuesadaComicBooks" /&gt; Marvel Comics worked with Brad Winderbaum, Jeremy Latcham, and Will Corona Pilgrim at Marvel Studios to decide which concepts should be carried over from the Marvel Comics Universe to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, what to show in the tie-in comics, and what to leave for the films.&lt;ref name="IM2comics"/&gt; Marvel has clarified which of the tie-in comics are considered official canonical MCU stories, with the rest merely inspired by the MCU, "where we get to show off all the characters from the film in costume and in comic form."&lt;ref name="PilgrimCanon2015" /&gt;

In August 2011, Marvel announced a series of [[direct-to-video]] [[short film]]s called [[Marvel One-Shots]],&lt;ref name="ShortsAnnouncement" /&gt; the name derived from the label used by Marvel Comics for their [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot comics]].&lt;ref name="AssemblingAUniverse" /&gt; Co-producer Brad Winderbaum said "It's a fun way to experiment with new characters and ideas, but more importantly it's a way for us to expand the Marvel Cinematic Universe and tell stories that live outside the plot of our features."&lt;ref name="ShortsAnnouncement" /&gt; Each short film is designed to be a self-contained story that provides more backstory for characters or events introduced in the films.&lt;ref name="ShortsDescription" /&gt; In July 2012, D'Esposito stated that Marvel was considering the idea of introducing established characters who may not yet be ready to carry their own feature films in future One-Shots, stating, "There's always a potential to introduce a character. We have 8,000 of them, and they can't all be at the same level. So maybe there are some that are not so popular, and we introduce them [with a short] – and they take off. I could see that happening."&lt;ref name="Item47" /&gt;

In March 2015, Marvel's Vice President of Animation Development and Production, Cort Lane, stated that animated tie-ins to the MCU were "in the works".&lt;ref name="LaneECCC2015" /&gt; That July, Marvel Studios partnered with [[Google]] to produce the faux news program ''[[WHIH Newsfront|WHIH Newsfront with Christine Everhart]]'', a series of in-universe [[YouTube]] videos serving as the center of a [[viral marketing]] campaign to promote the films and universe.&lt;ref name="WHIHPromo" /&gt; In December 2016, a six-part web series, ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot|Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Slingshot]]'', was revealed, which debuted on ABC.com on December 13, 2016. It follows [[Yo-Yo Rodriguez|Elena "Yo-Yo" Rodriguez]] on a secret mission, shortly before the start of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 4)|fourth season]], with [[Natalia Cordova-Buckley]] reprising her role.&lt;ref name="Slingshot" /&gt;

===Business practices===
[[File:Joss Whedon by Gage Skidmore 7.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joss Whedon]] was a large contributor to Phase Two, offering creative insight to all its films and launching the first MCU television series, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', while writing and directing ''Avengers: Age of Ultron''.]]
Marvel Studios developed specific business practices to create its shared universe, including choosing filmmakers that were considered "out-of-left-field", given their previous work. Feige remarked, "You don't have to have directed a big, giant visual-effects movie to do a big, giant visual-effects movie for us. You just have to have done something singularly sort of awesome,"&lt;ref name="ChooseDirector" /&gt; adding "It's worked out well for us when we've taken people [such as [[Jon Favreau]], [[Joss Whedon]], [[Kenneth Branagh]], and the [[Russo brothers]],] that have done very, very good things. Very rarely are one of those good things a big giant blockbuster superhero movie."&lt;ref name="IGNMar2014pg2" /&gt; The studio looks for filmmakers to hire who are able to guide a film.&lt;ref name="FastCompany" /&gt; When hiring directors, the studio usually has "a kernel of an idea of what we want", which is presented to potential directors over the course of several meetings to discuss and further expand. "And if over the course of three or four or five meetings they make it way better than what we initially were spewing to them, they usually get the job", according to Feige.&lt;ref name="FeigeSep2015" /&gt; Later expanding on this process, Feige explained that before talking to any directors on a film, Marvel Studios often puts together a "lookbook" of influences from the comics and art by Marvel's visual development department, to create a visual template for the film. These are put together at company retreats, which the studio holds every "18 months or so" to plan out and develop the phases of the MCU. These lookbooks are not always shown to directors, though, with Marvel sometimes preferring to let the director offer their own ideas first.&lt;ref name="FeigeRetreats" /&gt;

[[Scott Derrickson]] did not see a lookbook for ''Doctor Strange'', instead putting together his own presentation, with concept art and storyboards by himself and professionals he hired, to sell himself and his vision of the film to Marvel. In contrast, Marvel shared several different ideas for what ''Thor: Ragnarok'' could be with prospective filmmakers, who then went away and developed what they thought the film should be from that. [[Taika Waititi]] created a sizzle reel using clips from other films to present his vision based on Marvel's ideas, a practice that Marvel discourages as they "oftentimes can be really terrible". However, Marvel thought Waititi's was "amazing". Derrickson and Waititi were both eventually hired for the films.&lt;ref name="FeigeRetreats" /&gt; For ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', Joe and Anthony Russo met with the studio four times over two months before they were hired, during which they "kept getting more and more specific about what our vision was", putting together "reference videos, storyboards, script pages, you name it. We did like a 30-page book that had everything that we'd do with the character, from the theme of the movie to the tone of the film to the fighting style to what we liked about the character and what we didn't like". This meant that by the time they were hired they had already "figured the movie out".&lt;ref name="RussosDirectingProcess" /&gt;

When the studio hired Kenneth Branagh and Joe Johnston to direct ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' and ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', respectively, it made sure both directors were open to the idea of a shared universe and including ''Avengers'' set-up scenes in their films.&lt;ref name="BostonApril2012" /&gt; Joe Russo stated, "That's the exciting component of [incorporating references to the larger universe]. 'What can we set up for the future?' You're constantly pitching out ideas that not only affect your movie, but may have a ripple effect that affects other films ... It's a weird sort of tapestry of writers and directors working together to create this universe that's sort of organic."&lt;ref name="IGNMar2014pg4" /&gt; Anthony added, "The great thing about the Marvel [Cinematic Universe], just like the publishing [arm], it's a very vast, inter-connected universe, where characters will have their rise and fall, so to speak, and hand off to other characters. As the cinematic universe moves forward, you may start to see the cinematic universe adopt that same pattern, as the publishing has, where there's closure with some characters and new beginnings with other characters."&lt;ref name="RussosMTVAug2014" /&gt; He added that, for directors to "fit" in at Marvel, they must understand how to "take a larger story and wrangle it into a moment", yet keep it connected.&lt;ref name="IGNMar2014pg4" /&gt;

{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=The most simple way I could put it is Marvel doesn't come to the filmmakers and say, "Here's what the next movie is." They come to the filmmakers and say, "What is the next movie?" That's very much the process.|source=—Director Anthony Russo in April 2016&lt;ref name="RussosDirectingProcess" /&gt;}}
On allowing directors and writers to work within Marvel's shared universe concept, Joe Russo said that Feige has "big pieces that he knows he wants to build towards, but the way that you get there is open to interpretation and improv a little bit." For the Russos in ''The Winter Soldier'', they had to deal with the idea of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] being infiltrated by [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]], with Joe saying, "how we get there is all up to us. And I think why Marvel has been so successful is because it's been such a clear plan, that everything is interconnected and they're building emotional capital with each movie that you can then trade off of in the next film."&lt;ref name="RussosCrave" /&gt; Joe later elaborated that once each film's creative team "come up with conceptually what we want to do" for a film, then we will ask questions about whether this would interfere with a storyline in another movie. Or, what's going on in that film, can we pull some of that into this film? That's where you start looking for the interconnectedness, but it's very important early on that the concept be created in a bubble because you have to protect the idea, it has to be driven by storytelling. Kevin's ... always in the mindset of "let's just make this movie now and worry about the next movie when it comes."&lt;ref name="RussosDirectingProcess" /&gt;

Loeb explained that Marvel Television sees "ourselves as producers who are working to support the vision of our showrunner. But we're involved in every aspect of the production—whether it's being in the writers' room, editing on set, casting—every step of the production goes through the Marvel team to tell the best story that we can." He added that the studio is able to work on so many series across different networks and platforms because "it just requires that we make sure that there's always someone from Marvel there to help guide the process."&lt;ref name="LoebJul2017" /&gt;

Marvel Studios also began contracting their actors for multiple films, including signing actor [[Samuel L. Jackson]] to a then "unprecedented" nine-movie contract.&lt;ref name="THRFeb2009" /&gt; In July 2014, Feige said that the studio has all actors sign contracts for multiples films, with the norm being for 3 or more, and the 9 or 12 film deals "more rare".&lt;ref name="FeigeContracts" /&gt; Actor's contracts also feature clauses that allows Marvel to use up to three minutes of an actor's performance from one film for another, which Marvel describes as "bridging material".&lt;ref name="CreativeCommittee2" /&gt; At Marvel Television, actors such as [[Charlie Cox]] ([[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock / Daredevil]] in ''Daredevil'') and [[Adrianne Palicki]] ([[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Bobbi Morse / Mockingbird]] in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'') are contractually obliged to appear in a Marvel film if asked.&lt;ref name="CoxFilms" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PalickiFilms" /&gt; In May 2015, after starring as [[Claire Temple]] in the first season of ''Daredevil'', [[Rosario Dawson]] signed with Marvel to return for the second season of the series as part of an "exclusive TV deal" that also allows her to appear in any other Marvel Netflix series.&lt;ref name="DawsonDeal" /&gt; Dawson's character has been featured as well in all the other Netflix shows, except ''The Punisher'', linking them together similarly to Jackson's Nick Fury in the films.&lt;ref name="DawsonNoPunisher" /&gt; Dawson explained that she signs on with Marvel for a year at a time, for a certain amount of episodes, and finds out which series the episodes are for closer to the time of filming.&lt;ref name="DawsonExplain" /&gt;

In August 2012, Marvel signed Joss Whedon to an exclusive contract through June 2015 for film and television. With the deal, Whedon would "contribute creatively" on Phase Two of the MCU and develop the first television series set in the universe.&lt;ref name="WhedonConsultDeal" /&gt; In March 2013, Whedon expanded on his consulting responsibilities, saying, "I understand what Kevin [Feige] is going for and where he's heading, and I read the scripts and watch cuts and talk to the directors and writers and give my opinion. Occasionally there could be some writing. But I'm not trying to get in anybody's soup, I'm just trying to be helpful."&lt;ref name="WhedonConsultQuote" /&gt; Whedon later elaborated that "Since the story has already been approved and everybody knows what we're doing with ''Avengers 2'', we can really lay it out. It's not like anyone's saying "well I don't know, what if I need that?" It's like "doing this is troublesome for us, whereas doing this will actually help us." ... You want to honor the events of the last movie but you don't want to be beholden to them, because some people will see ''Avengers[: Age of Ultron]'' who did not see any of the movies in between or even ''Avengers 1''." He also found working in television and [[script doctor]]ing to be "great training ground[s] for dealing with this ... because you're given a bunch of pieces and told to make them fit—even if they don't."&lt;ref name="WhedonConsultInterview" /&gt;

For the Russo brothers and writers [[Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely]] working on ''Avengers: Infinity War'' and Phase Three, they saw "a through line from ''Winter Soldier'', through ''Civil War'', right to ''Infinity War''", with films like ''Doctor Strange'' and ''Thor: Ragnarok'' laying groundwork for the "culmination" in ''Infinity War''. Subsequently, they talked "to the directors and writers of the other Phase 3 movies on an almost weekly basis, to make sure everything lines up right."&lt;ref name="RussosWritersPhase3" /&gt; [[Peyton Reed]], director of ''Ant-Man'' and ''Ant-Man and the Wasp'', felt the relationship and collaboration between the Phase Three directors was "probably the closest thing that this generation will have to a '30s- or '40s-era [[studio system]] where you are all on the lot and you are all working on different things."&lt;ref name="ReedTHRJul2018" /&gt; Similarly, when developing the crossover miniseries ''The Defenders'', showrunner Marco Ramirez consulted with the creators of all the individual Marvel Netflix series, having them read each of the scripts for ''The Defenders'' and provide insight into the individual character's world.&lt;ref name="RamirezEWJan2017" /&gt; In April 2017, along with his announcement that he was returning to write and direct ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3]]'', [[James Gunn]] revealed he would be working with Marvel "to help design where these stories go, and make sure the future of the Marvel Cosmic Universe is as special and authentic and magical as what we have created so far."&lt;ref name="GunnVol3Confirm" /&gt; However, in July 2018, Disney and Marvel severed ties with Gunn following controversy surrounding several old jokes Gunn had made.&lt;ref name="GunnFiredTHR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GunnFiredDeadline" /&gt;

Additionally, [[Paul Bettany]] was the first actor to portray two main characters within the universe, voicing [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]]'s [[artificial intelligence]] [[Edwin Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S.|J.A.R.V.I.S.]] in the ''Iron Man'' and ''Avengers'' films, and portraying [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]] in ''Avengers'' films and ''Captain America: Civil War''.&lt;ref name="BettanyRoles" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BettanyCapCW" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BettanyIW" /&gt; [[Stan Lee]], creator or co-creator of many of the characters seen in the MCU, has [[cameo appearance]]s in all of the feature films and television series except ''Inhumans''. In ''Iron Fist'', it is revealed his on-set photograph cameo in the Marvel Netflix series is as [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] Captain [[Forbush Man|Irving Forbush]].&lt;ref name="LeeForbush" /&gt; His cameo in ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' sees Lee appearing as an informant to the [[Watcher (comics)|Watchers]], discussing previous adventures that include Lee's cameos in other MCU films; he specifically mentions his time as a [[FedEx]] delivery man, referring to Lee's cameo in ''Captain America: Civil War''.&lt;ref name="LeeCameo3" /&gt; This acknowledged the fan theory that Lee may be portraying the same character in all his cameos,&lt;ref name="LeeCameo2" /&gt; with writer and director James Gunn noting that "people thought Stan Lee is &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Uatu|Uatu the Watcher]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; and that all of these cameos are part of him being a Watcher. So, Stan Lee as a guy who is working for the Watchers was something that I thought was fun for the MCU."&lt;ref name="LeeCameo3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeeCameo2" /&gt; Feige added that Lee "clearly exists, you know, above and apart from the reality of all the films. So the notion that he could be sitting there on a cosmic pit stop during the jump gate sequence in ''Guardians''...really says, so wait a minute, he's this same character who's popped up in all these films?"&lt;ref name="LeeCameo" /&gt;

==Reception==
Jim Vorel of ''[[Herald &amp; Review]]'' called the Marvel Cinematic Universe "complicated" and "impressive", but said, "As more and more heroes get their own film adaptations, the overall universe becomes increasingly confusing."&lt;ref name="Herald&amp;Review" /&gt; Kofi Outlaw of ''Screen Rant'' stated that while ''The Avengers'' was a success, "Marvel Studios still has room to improve their approach to building a shared movie universe".&lt;ref name="ScreenRant_2013-06-27" /&gt; Some reviewers criticized the fact that the desire to create a shared universe led to films that did not hold as well on their own. In his review of ''Thor: The Dark World'', ''[[Forbes]]'' critic Scott Mendelson likened the MCU to "a glorified television series", with ''The Dark World'' being a "'stand-alone' episode that contains little long-range mythology."&lt;ref name="ForbesMCUReception" /&gt; Collider's Matt Goldberg considered that while ''Iron Man 2'', ''Thor'' and ''Captain America: The First Avenger'' were quality productions, "they have never really been their own movies", feeling that the plot detours to S.H.I.E.L.D. or lead-ups to ''The Avengers'' dragged down the films' narratives.&lt;ref name="ColliderMCUReception" /&gt;

The metaphor of the MCU as "the world's biggest TV show" was discussed again, after the release of ''Captain America: Civil War'', by Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'', who felt that film in particular highlighted Marvel's success with the model, saying, "Viewed in complete isolation, the plot of ''Captain America: Civil War'' makes little to no sense ... [but] when you think about where [Captain America] has been in earlier Marvel films ... his leeriness about being subject to oversight makes a lot more sense." VanDerWerff continued that when thinking about the MCU as a television series, many "common criticisms people tend to level at it take on a new context" such as complaints that the films are formulaic, lack "visual spark", or "shoehorn in story elements" that "are necessary to set up future films", all characteristics that "are fairly typical on television, where a director's influence is much lower than that of the showrunner", in this case, Feige. Comparing the films to the series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' specifically, VanDerWerff noted that each solo film checks "in on various characters and their individual side stories, before bringing everyone together in the finale (or, rather, an Avengers film)", with ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' being equivalent to the character [[Daenerys Targaryen]]—"both separated by long distances from everybody else." He noted that this format was an extension of early "TV-like" film franchises such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', as well as the format of the comics upon which the films are based. "I say all of this not to suggest that film franchises resembling TV series is necessarily a good trend", VanDerWerff concluded, "For as much as I generally enjoy the Marvel movies, I'm disheartened by the possibility that their particular form might take over the film industry ... But I also don't think it's the end of the world if Marvel continues on ... there's a reason TV has stolen so much of the cultural conversation over the past few decades. There's something legitimately exciting about the way the medium tells stories when it's good, and if nothing else, Marvel's success shows the film world could learn from that."&lt;ref name="VoxCivilWarTV" /&gt;

Following the conclusion of season one of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', Mary McNamara at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the connections between that series and the films, stating that "never before has television been literally married to film, charged with filling in the back story and creating the connective tissue of an ongoing film franchise ... [''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''] is now not only a very good show in its own right, it's part of Marvel's multiplatform city-state. It faces a future of perpetual re-invention, and that puts it in the exhilarating first car of television's roller-coaster ride toward possible world domination."&lt;ref name="LATimesSHIELDReview" /&gt; Terri Schwartz of Zap2it agreed with this sentiment, stating that "the fact that [''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''] so influenced the show is game-changing in terms of how the mediums of film and television can be interwoven", though "the fault there seems to be that ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' had to bide time until ''The Winter Soldier''{{'}}s release", which led to much criticism.&lt;ref name="Zap2itSHIELDReview" /&gt;

In January 2015, Michael Doran of [[Newsarama]] and Graeme McMillian of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' had a "point-counterpoint" debate in response to the first ''Ant-Man'' trailer. Doran stated, "Marvel has raised the bar {{em|sooo}} high that as opposed to just allowing another film to finish under the [MCU] bar, we're all overly and perhaps even eager to overreact to the first thing that doesn't clear it". McMillian responded, "at this point, Marvel's brand is such that I'm not sure it can offer up something like [the trailer] {{em|without}} it seeming like a crushing disappointment ... part of Marvel's brand is that it {{em|doesn't}} offer the kind of run-of-the-mill superhero movie that you're talking about, that it's ... at least different enough to tweak and play with the genre somehow ... The fact that there's such upset about this trailer being ... well, okay ... suggests to me that the audience {{em|is}} expecting something to knock their socks off." Doran concluded, "That does seem to be the point here—the expectations fans now have for everything Marvel Studios ... [and] Marvel {{em|is}} going to eventually falter."&lt;ref name="NewsaramaDiscussionJan2015" /&gt;

After seeing the portrayal of [[Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)|Yellowjacket]] in ''Ant-Man'', the antagonist of the film, McMillian noted, &lt;blockquote&gt;It's hardly a secret that Marvel Studios has a bit of a problem when it comes to offering up exciting characters for their heroes to fight against ... [their] villains generally fall into one of two camps. There's the Unstoppable Monster ... or there's the Professional White Guy In A Suit With An Ego ... No matter which of the groups the above villains fall into, they share one common purpose: ''evil''. The motivations for evil likely differ—although, invariably, they fall under the umbrella of 'misguided belief in a greater good that doesn't exist'—but that really doesn't matter, because without fail, there will be so little time in the movie to actually properly explore those motivations, meaning that to all intents and purposes, the villain is being evil for reasons of plot necessity and little else ... The strange thing about this is that Marvel's comic books offer a number of wonderful, colorful bad guys who could step outside the above parameters and offer an alternative to the formulaic villains audiences have gotten used to (and arguably bored with) ... In future movies, we can only hope [they are] treated in such a way that their freak flags are allowed to fly free.&lt;ref name="THRVillians" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the release of ''Jessica Jones'', David Priest at [[CNET|c&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;net]] wrote about how the series rescues "Marvel from itself ... ''Jessica Jones'' takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like it matters. Our culture needs stories like this. Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming."&lt;ref name="CNETJJ" /&gt; For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of ''Forbes'', watching the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the "morally complex, violent, dark world of ''Jessica Jones'' has no place in the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like ''Jessica Jones'' and ''Daredevil'', while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU."&lt;ref name="KainForbesJJ" /&gt; Tassi went so far as to wonder what "the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe" is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the ''Winter Soldier'' reveal on ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and saying that ''Jessica Jones'' is "so far removed from the world of ''The Avengers'', it might as well not be in the same universe at all ... [I] really don't understand the point of [the MCU] if they're going to keep everything within it separated off in these little boxes".&lt;ref name="TassiForbesJJ" /&gt; Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called ''Jessica Jones''{{'}}s lack of overt connections to the MCU "the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, ''Jessica Jones'' also proves the MCU's thematic durability."&lt;ref name="InverseJJ" /&gt;

In April 2016, Marvel Studios revealed that [[Alfre Woodard]] would appear in ''Captain America: Civil War'', having already been cast as [[Black Mariah (comics)|Mariah Dillard]] in ''Luke Cage'' the previous year.&lt;ref name="WoodardSC" /&gt; This "raised hopes that Marvel could be uniting its film and Netflix universes",&lt;ref name="WoodardIGN" /&gt; with "one of the first and strongest connections" between the two.&lt;ref name="WoodardSC" /&gt; However, ''Civil War'' writers Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely revealed that Woodard would instead be portraying [[Miriam Sharpe]] in the film, explaining that she had been cast on the suggestion of Robert Downey, Jr., and they had not learnt of her casting in ''Luke Cage'' until afterwards.&lt;ref name="WoodardSC" /&gt; This was not the first instance of actors being cast in multiple roles in the MCU, but this casting was called more "significant", and seen by many as a "disappointing" indication of "the growing divide" and "lack of more satisfying cooperation" between Marvel Studios and Marvel Television following the September 2015 corporate reshuffling of Marvel Entertainment.&lt;ref name="WoodardSC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WoodardSF" /&gt;

Speaking to the 1990s setting of ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', "the MCU's first full period piece since Phase One's ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' in 2011", Richard Newby of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' felt the return of younger versions of some characters introduced and killed in earlier films "open[ed] up the MCU in a whole new way and broaden[ed] the franchise's mantra of 'it's all connected'." Speaking specifically to Clark Gregg's appearance as Agent Phil Coulson in the film, Newby noted the appearance "doesn't exactly mend fences between Marvel's film and TV divisions, [but] it does strengthen the connective tissue and the sense that these characters still matter in the grand scheme of Marvel's film plans." He also hoped that continuity from ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' would be maintained in ''Captain Marvel'', especially since Coulson has dealt with the Kree in the series. Newby also added that shifting to different time periods would help Marvel Studios "sustain this cinematic universe for the next 10 years" by allowing them to repeat some of the genres previously used, as they could then feel "fresh" and have "different rules and different restraints," as well as allow them to build upon material established in the television series such as ''Agent Carter''. He concluded, "Marvel Studios has an entire sandbox to play in, but, for necessary reasons, has largely chosen to remain in a small corner in order to ground audiences in these concepts. Now that the basis has been laid, the opportunity for exploration in both film and television lies ahead, with ''Captain Marvel'' leading the way. Wherever Marvel Studios plans to take the MCU in the future, it's refreshing to know that its past is expansive and filled with infinite possibilities."&lt;ref name="THRMar2018CaptainMarvel" /&gt;

==Cultural impact==

===Other studios===
After the release of ''The Avengers'' in May 2012, Tom Russo of [[Boston.com]] noted that aside from the occasional "novelty" such as ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Aliens vs. Predator]]'' (2004), the idea of a shared universe was virtually unheard of in Hollywood.&lt;ref name="BostonApril2012" /&gt; Since that time, the shared universe model created by Marvel Studios has begun to be replicated by other film studios that held rights to other comic book characters. In April 2014, Tuna Amobi, a media analyst for [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] Equity Research Services, stated that in the previous three to five years, Hollywood studios began planning "megafranchises" for years to come, opposed to working one blockbuster at a time. Amobi added, "A lot of these superhero characters were just being left there to gather dust. Disney has proved that this [approach and genre] can be a gold mine."&lt;ref name="ASM2EW" /&gt; However, with additional studios now "playing the megafranchise game", Doug Creutz, media analyst for [[Cowen and Company]], feels the allure will eventually die for audiences: "If Marvel's going to make two or three films a year, and Warner Brothers is going to do at least a film every year, and Sony's going to do a film every year, and Fox [is] going to do a film every year, can everyone do well in that scenario? I'm not sure they can."&lt;ref name="ASM2EW" /&gt; In March 2018, Patrick Shanley of ''The Hollywood Reporter'' opined that "the key differences between a regular franchise, such as ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' or [[Pitch Perfect (film series)|''Pitch Perfect'' films]], and a shared universe is the amount of planning and interweaving that goes into each individual film. Its all too easy to make a film that exists solely for the purpose of setting up future installments and expanding a world, rather than a film that stands on its own merits while deftly hinting or winking at its place in the larger mythos. In that, the MCU has flourished." He felt that ''Iron Man'' "itself was aimed at being an enjoyable stand-alone experience, not as an overall advertisement for 17 subsequent movies. That mentality has persisted through most of the MCU films over the past decade, which is all the more impressive as its roster of heroes now exceeds the two-dozen mark."&lt;ref name="THRMarch2018SharedUniverses" /&gt;

====DC Entertainment and Warner Bros. Pictures====
{{main|DC Extended Universe|Arrowverse}}
In October 2012, following its legal victory over [[Joe Shuster]]'s estate for the rights to [[Superman]], [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] announced that it planned to move ahead with its long-awaited [[Justice League]] [[Justice League in other media#Film|film]], uniting such [[DC Comics]] superheroes as [[Batman]], Superman, and [[Wonder Woman]]. The company was expected to take the opposite approach to Marvel, releasing individual films for the characters after they have appeared in a [[team-up]] film.&lt;ref name="LATimesOct2012" /&gt; The release of ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]'' in 2013 was intended to be the start of a new shared universe for DC, "laying the groundwork for the future slate of films based on DC Comics."&lt;ref name="ManofSteel" /&gt; In 2014, Warner Bros. announced that slate of films, similarly to Disney and Marvel claiming dates for films years in advance.&lt;ref name="DCUntitledFilms" /&gt; That year, DC CCO [[Geoff Johns]] stated that the television series ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' were set in a separate universe from the new film one,&lt;ref name="DCSeparateUniverses" /&gt; later clarifying that "We look at it as the [[multiverse]]. We have our TV universe and our film universe, but they all co-exist. For us, creatively, it's about allowing everyone to make the best possible product, to tell the best story, to do the best world. Everyone has a vision and you really want to let the visions shine through ... It's just a different approach [to Marvel's]."&lt;ref name="DCMultiverse" /&gt;

Discussing the apparent failure of the cinematic universe's first team-up film, ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like "showrunner" in Feige, "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director [[Zack Snyder]], whose DC films "seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but a long series of teases for other ones. It's like he knows what he needs to do but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled."&lt;ref name="VoxCivilWarTV" /&gt; Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the ''Justice League'' films, on top of Johns' involvement in several "solo" films, such as the post-production process of ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' or the writing process of a standalone Batman film.&lt;ref name="DCEUShakeUp" /&gt; After the successful release of ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president [[Diane Nelson (comics)|Diane Nelson]] stating, "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn't make sense, but there's no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you'll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who's creating them." Additionally, DC began focusing on films "completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside the" DCEU as part of a new label, with the first centered on the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].&lt;ref name="VultureDCFilmsSep2017" /&gt;

====20th Century Fox====
{{main|X-Men (film series)|Fantastic Four in film}}
In November 2012, [[20th Century Fox]] announced plans to create their own shared universe, consisting of Marvel properties that it holds the rights to including the [[Fantastic Four]] and X-Men, with the hiring of [[Mark Millar]] as supervising producer. Millar said, "Fox are thinking, 'We're sitting on some really awesome things here. There is another side of the Marvel Universe. Let's try and get some cohesiveness going.' So they brought me in to oversee that really. To meet with the writers and directors to suggest new ways we could take this stuff and new properties that could spin out of it."&lt;ref name="SlashFilmNov2012" /&gt; ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', released in 2014, was Fox's first step towards expanding their stable of Marvel properties and creating this universe,&lt;ref name="IGNFoxSony" /&gt; ahead of the release of a [[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|''Fantastic Four'' reboot film]] the next year.&lt;ref name="FantasticFour" /&gt; However, in May 2014, ''Days of Future Past'' and ''Fantastic Four'' screenwriter [[Simon Kinberg]] stated that the latter film would not take place in the same universe as the ''X-Men'' films, explaining that "none of the ''X-Men'' movies have acknowledged the notion of a sort of superhero team—the Fantastic Four. And the Fantastic Four acquire powers, so for them to live in a world where mutants are prevalent is kind of complicated, because you're like, 'Oh, you're just a mutant.' Like, 'What's so fantastic about you?' ... they live in discrete universes."&lt;ref name="FantasticFour" /&gt; In July 2015, ''X-Men'' director [[Bryan Singer]] said that there was still potential for a crossover between the ''X-Men'' and ''Fantastic Four'' franchises, if reaction to ''Fantastic Four'' and ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' warranted it.&lt;ref name="SingerCrossover" /&gt;

Feeling that Singer's efforts in ''Apocalypse'' to establish a larger world, similar to the MCU, did not meet the standards established by Marvel, VanDerWerff noted that unlike Feige's ability to serve as "pseudo-showrunner", Singer is instead "steeped in film and the way movie stories have always been told", so "when it comes time to have ''Apocalypse'' dovetail with story threads from the earlier ''[[X-Men: First Class]]'' (which was directed by [[Matthew Vaughn]]), both Singer's direction and Simon Kinberg's script rely on hackneyed devices and clumsy storytelling", indicating a lack of "the kind of big-picture thinking this sort of mega franchise requires".&lt;ref name="VoxCivilWarTV" /&gt;

====Sony Pictures====
{{main|Spider-Man in film}}
In November 2013, [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] Co-Chairman [[Amy Pascal]] announced that the studio intended to expand their universe created within the [[Spider-Man in film#Marc Webb series|Marc Webb ''Amazing Spider-Man'' series]], with spin-off adventures for supporting characters, in an attempt to replicate Marvel and Disney's model.&lt;ref name="IGNFoxSony" /&gt; The next month, Sony announced [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and [[Sinister Six]] films, both set in the ''Amazing Spider-Man'' universe. With this announcement, [[IGN]] stated that the spin-offs are "the latest example of what we can refer to as "the ''Avengers'' effect" in Hollywood, as studios work to build interlocking movie universes."&lt;ref name="VenomSinisterSixIGN" /&gt; Sony chose not to replicate the Marvel Studios model of introducing individual characters first before bringing them together in a team-up film, instead making the Spider-Man adversaries the stars of future films.&lt;ref name="ASM2EW" /&gt; However, in February 2015, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced that the ''Spider-Man'' franchise would be retooled, with a new film co-produced by Feige and Pascal being released in July 2017, and the character being integrated into the MCU. Sony Pictures would continue to finance, distribute, own, and have final creative control of the ''Spider-Man'' films.&lt;ref name="SpideyMCU" /&gt; With this announcement, sequels to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' were canceled,&lt;ref name="VarietySpidey" /&gt; and by November 2015 the Venom and Sinister Six films, as well as spin-offs based on female characters in the Spider-Man universe, were no longer moving forward.&lt;ref name="VarietySpidey" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SpideySpinoffs" /&gt; By March 2016, the Venom film had itself been retooled, to start its own franchise unrelated to the MCU Spider-Man.&lt;ref name="VenomMar2016" /&gt; A year later, Sony officially announced the Venom film to be in development, for an October 5, 2018 release,&lt;ref name="VenomMar2017" /&gt; along with a film centered on the characters [[Silver Sable]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] known as ''Silver &amp; Black''.&lt;ref name="SilverSableBlackCat" /&gt; Both projects were not intended to be a part of the MCU nor spin-offs to ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', but rather part of an intended separate shared universe known as [[Sony's Marvel Universe]].&lt;ref name="SilverSableBlackCat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VenomNotMCU" /&gt;

After Sony canceled their shared universe plans and started sharing the Spider-Man character with Marvel Studios, multiple critics discussed their failure at replicating the MCU. Scott Meslow of ''[[The Week]]'' noted the perceived flaws of the first ''Amazing Spider-Man'' film, outside of its lead performances, and how the sequel "doubles down on all the missteps of the original while adding a few of its own. …We now have a textbook example of how not to reboot a superhero franchise, and if Sony and Marvel are wise, they'll take virtually all those lessons to heart as they chart Spider-Man's next course."&lt;ref name="ASMWeek" /&gt; Scott Mendelson noted that ''The Amazing Spider-Man 2'' "was sold as less a sequel to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' than a backdoor pilot for ''Spider-Man vs. the Sinister Six''. …Had Sony stuck with the original plan of a scaled-down superhero franchise, one that really was rooted in romantic drama, they would have at least stuck out in a crowded field of superhero franchises. When every superhero film is now going bigger, ''Amazing Spider-Man'' could have distinguished itself by going small and intimate." This would have saved Sony "a boatload of money", and potentially reversed the film's relative financial failure.&lt;ref name="ASMForbes" /&gt;

===Academia===
In September 2014, the [[University of Baltimore]] announced a course beginning in the 2015 [[academic term|spring semester]] revolving around the Marvel Cinematic Universe, to be taught by Arnold T. Blumberg. "Media Genres: Media Marvels" examines "how Marvel's series of interconnected films and television shows, plus related media and comic book sources and [[Joseph Campbell]]'s [[monomyth|monomyth of the 'hero's journey']], offer important insights into modern culture" as well as Marvel's efforts "to establish a viable universe of plotlines, characters, and backstories."&lt;ref name="UBaltCourse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UBaltCourse2" /&gt;

==Outside media==
===Disney theme park attractions===
{{main|Marvel-themed areas at Disney parks}}
After the acquisition by Disney in 2009, Marvel films began to be marketed at the [[Innoventions (Disneyland)|Innoventions]] attraction in [[Tomorrowland#Disneyland (California)|Tomorrowland]] at [[Disneyland]]. For ''Iron Man 3'', the exhibit, entitled Iron Man Tech Presented by Stark Industries, features the same armor display that was shown at the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, with the Marks I-VII and the new Mark XLII. In addition, there is a simulator game, titled "Become Iron Man", that uses [[Kinect]]-like technology to allow the viewer to be encased in an animated Mark XLII armor and take part in a series of "tests," in which you fire repulsor rays and fly through Tony Stark's workshop. The game is guided by [[J.A.R.V.I.S.]], who is voiced again by [[Paul Bettany]]. The exhibit also has smaller displays that include helmets and chest pieces from the earlier films and the gauntlet and boot from an action sequence in ''Iron Man 3''.&lt;ref name="IM3Disneyland" /&gt; The exhibit for ''Thor: The Dark World'' is called Thor: Treasures of Asgard, and features displays of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgardian]] relics and transports guests to [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]'s throne room, where they are greeted by Thor.&lt;ref name="ThorTDWDisneyland" /&gt; ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''{{'}}s exhibit, Captain America: The Living Legend and Symbol of Courage, features a meet and greet experience.&lt;ref name="CapTWSDisneyland" /&gt;

From May to September 2017, Disneyland Resort featured the "Summer of Heroes", which sees members of the Guardians and Avengers making appearances throughout the Disneyland Resort. Additionally, the Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Dance Off event was featured, which involved [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill / Star-Lord]] blasting music from his boombox, along with the Avengers Training Initiative, a limited experience where [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]] "assemble a group of young recruits to see if they have what it takes to be an Avenger." Marvel related food and merchandise was also available throughout [[Hollywood Land]] at [[Disney California Adventure]] during the "Summer of Heroes".&lt;ref name="GotGBreakoutOpening" /&gt;

In March 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced three new Marvel-themed areas inspired by the MCU to Disney California Adventure, [[Walt Disney Studios Paris]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]. The developments will be designed by [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] in collaboration with [[Marvel Studios]] and Marvel Themed Entertainment.&lt;ref name="VarietyDisneyParks" /&gt;

====Hong Kong Disneyland====
In October 2013, the [[Iron Man Experience]] attraction was announced for Hong Kong Disneyland.&lt;ref name="IronManExperience" /&gt; It is set in the [[Tomorrowland]] section of the park,&lt;ref name="IMExpDS" /&gt; with the area built to look like a new Stark Expo created by Tony Stark after the 2010 one, as seen in ''[[Iron Man 2]]'',&lt;ref name="IMExpStarkExpo" /&gt; with various exhibit halls that include the Mark III armor from the films.&lt;ref name="IMExpDS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IMExpMKIII" /&gt; The area also has Iron Man and Marvel-themed merchandise items and memorabilia, plus an interactive game where guests can have the chance to try on Iron Man's armor.&lt;ref name="IMExpReleaseDate" /&gt; Iron Man Experience sees guests assist Iron Man in defeating Hydra throughout Hong Kong,&lt;ref name="IMExpDS" /&gt; and opened on January 11, 2017.&lt;ref name="IMExpReleaseDate" /&gt;

In March 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to Hong Kong Disneyland and a new attraction where guests team up with Ant-Man and the Wasp, to join Iron Man Experience.&lt;ref name="VarietyDisneyParks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DisneyParksMar2018" /&gt; Inspired by ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]'',&lt;ref name="AMWaspRide" /&gt; Ant Man and the Wasp: Nano Battle! is an enclosed interactive dark ride that sees guests use laser powered weapons to team up with Ant-Man and the Wasp to defeat [[Arnim Zola]] and his army of Hydra swarm bots.&lt;ref name="AMWaspRide" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMWaspRideName" /&gt; Ant Man and the Wasp: Nano Battle! replaces the [[Buzz Lightyear attractions|Buzz Lightyear Astro Blasters]] ride,&lt;ref name="AMWaspRide" /&gt; and is scheduled to open in 2019.&lt;ref name="AMWaspRideName" /&gt;

====Disney California Adventure====
By San Diego Comic-Con 2016, the [[The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror|Tower of Terror]] at Disney California Adventure was set to be replaced by a new attraction, [[Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!]]. [[Chris Pratt]], [[Zoe Saldana]], [[Dave Bautista]] and [[Benicio del Toro]] all filmed exclusive footage for the attraction, reprising their roles as [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill / Star-Lord]], [[Gamora]], [[Drax the Destroyer|Drax]] and [[Collector (comics)|Taneleer Tivan / The Collector]], respectively.&lt;ref name="GotGBreakout" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GotGBreakout2" /&gt; James Gunn, director of ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' and its sequel, directed footage for the attraction and consulted on all aspects of it.&lt;ref name="GotGBreakoutGunn" /&gt; Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout! sees visitors assisting Rocket to rescue the other Guardians from the Collector's fortress, while the attraction features randomized events during the experience and music inspired by the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (soundtrack)#Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack)|Awesome Mix Vol. 1]]'' soundtrack. The attraction opened on May 27, 2017.&lt;ref name="GotGBreakoutOpening" /&gt; Despite having multiple references to the MCU, the attraction is not part of the MCU, rather the start of its own theme park universe that is inspired by the MCU.&lt;ref name="GotGBreakoutMCUConnection" /&gt;

In March 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to Disney California Adventure, anchored by Mission: Breakout!, that will see characters from the MCU such as Iron Man and Spider-Man join the Guardians of the Galaxy in a "completely immersive superhero universe." The area will replace the "[[A Bug's Land]]" area, which closed in mid-2018 to start construction on the Marvel area.&lt;ref name="VarietyDisneyParks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DisneyParksMar2018" /&gt;

====Walt Disney Studios Park====
In March 2018, The Walt Disney Company announced a new Marvel-themed area inspired by the MCU to [[Disneyland Paris]]' Walt Disney Studios Park. The area will include a reimagined attraction where riders will team up with Iron Man and other Avengers on a "hyper-kinetic adventure" in 2020. The park will also host the "Summer of Super Heroes" live-action stage show from June–September 2018.&lt;ref name="VarietyDisneyParks" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DisneyParksMar2018" /&gt;

===Other live attractions===
====Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N.====
In May 2014, the Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. (Scientific Training and Tactical Intelligence Operative Network) exhibit opened at the [[Discovery Times Square]] center. The exhibit features replica set pieces, as well as actual props from the films, mixed with interactive technology and information, crafted through a partnership with [[NASA]] and other scientists. Titus Welliver also provides a "debrief" to visitors, reprising his role as S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Felix Blake. Created by Victory Hill Exhibits, Avengers S.T.A.T.I.O.N. cost $7.5&amp;nbsp;million to create,&lt;ref name="AvengersSTATIONDailyNews" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AvengersSTATIONEW" /&gt; and ran through early September 2015.&lt;ref name="AvengersSTATIONClosing" /&gt;

The exhibit also opened in [[South Korea]] at the [[War Memorial of Korea]] in April 2015,&lt;ref name="STATIONKorea" /&gt;&lt;ref name="STATIONLasVegas" /&gt; in Paris, France, at [[Esplanade de La Défense (Paris Métro)|Esplanade de La Défense]] a year later, and in Las Vegas at the [[Treasure Island Hotel and Casino]] in June 2016.&lt;ref name="STATIONLasVegas" /&gt; The Las Vegas version of the exhibit featured updated character details and corresponding science to incorporate the Marvel films that have released since the original exhibit in New York. Additionally, the Las Vegas version features Cobie Smulders reprising her role as Maria Hill to "debrief" visitors, replacing Welliver.&lt;ref name="STATIONLasVegas2" /&gt;

====GOMA exhibit====
An art exhibit, titled "Marvel: Creating the Cinematic Universe", was displayed exclusively at the [[Queensland Gallery of Modern Art]] (GOMA) from May to September 2017. The exhibit, which included "300 plus objects, films, costumes, drawings and other ephemera", featured content "from the collection of Marvel Studios and Marvel Entertainment and private collections" with "significant focus [given] to the creative artists who translate the drawn narrative to the screen through production design and storyboarding, costume and prop design, and special effects and postproduction". "Marvel: Creating the Cinematic Universe" was also extended to GOMA's Australian Cinémathèque with a retrospective of the MCU films.&lt;ref name="GOMA" /&gt;

===Television specials===
===={{anchor|Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe}}''Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe'' (2014)====
On March 18, 2014, ABC aired a one-hour [[television special]] titled ''Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe'', which documented the history of Marvel Studios and the development of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and included exclusive interviews and behind-the-scenes footage from all of the films, One-Shots and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', and sneak peeks of ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', ''Guardians of the Galaxy'', unaired episodes of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'',&lt;ref name="TVSpecial" /&gt; and ''Ant-Man''.&lt;ref name="TVSpecialAntMan" /&gt; Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt the special, "contains a pretty interesting business and creative story. While it might all make sense in hindsight, there was appreciable audacity in Marvel's plan to release five loosely connected movies from the same hero-filled world, beginning with the cinematically unproven ''Iron Man'' and culminating with superhero team ''The Avengers''. As such, this fast-moving hour qualifies as more than just a cut-and-paste job from electronic press kits, although there's an element of that, certainly."&lt;ref name="VarietySpecialReview" /&gt; The special was released on September 9, 2014 on the home media for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' season 1.&lt;ref name="SHIELDS1HomeMedia" /&gt;

===={{anchor|Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!}}''Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!'' (2014)====
In September 2014, ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' executive producer Jeffrey Bell stated that in order to meet production demands and avoid having to air repeat episodes, ABC would likely air a Marvel special in place of a regular installment at some point during the first ten episodes of ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s second season.&lt;ref name="BellSep2014" /&gt; In October, the special was revealed to be ''Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!'', which was hosted by [[Emily VanCamp]], who portrays [[Sharon Carter|Agent 13]] in ''Captain America: The Winter Soldier'', and aired on November 4, 2014.&lt;ref name="PulptoPop" /&gt; The special features behind the scenes footage from ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' and ''Ant-Man'', as well as footage from the ''Agent Carter'' television series previously screened at [[New York Comic-Con]].&lt;ref name="IGNSpecial2Review" /&gt; Brian Lowry of ''Variety'' felt an hour for the special did not "do the topic justice" adding, "For anyone who has seen more than one Marvel movie but would shrug perplexedly at the mention of Jack Kirby or [[Steve Ditko]], ''Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp To Pop!'' should probably be required viewing. Fun, fast-paced and encompassing many of the company's highlights along with a few lowlights, it's a solid primer on Marvel's history, while weaving in inevitable self-promotion and synergistic plugs."&lt;ref name="VarietySpecial2Review" /&gt; Eric Goldman of IGN also wished the special had been longer, adding, "Understandably, the more you already know about Marvel, the less you'll be surprised by ''Marvel 75 Years: From Pulp to Pop!'', but it's important to remember who this special is really made for – a mainstream audience who have embraced the Marvel characters, via the hugely successful movies, in a way no one could have imagined."&lt;ref name="IGNSpecial2Review" /&gt;

===Books===
In September 2015, Marvel announced the ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe'', named as a nod to the ''[[Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe]]''. Each guidebook is compiled by Mike O'Sullivan and the ''Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe'' team, with cover art from [[Mike del Mundo]] and Pascal Campion, and features facts about the MCU films, film-to-comic comparisons, and production stills. ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Iron Man'', ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Incredible Hulk / Marvel's Iron Man 2'',&lt;ref name="Guidebook" /&gt; ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Thor'',&lt;ref name="GuidebookThor" /&gt; and ''Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe: Marvel's Captain America: The First Avenger''&lt;ref name="GuidebookCapTFA" /&gt; released each month from October 2015 to January 2016, respectively.

In November 2018, Marvel and [[Titan Publishing Group]] released ''Marvel Studios: The First Ten Years'' to celebrate the first ten years of the Marvel Cinematic Universe which featured cast interviews, in-depth sections on each film, and an [[Easter egg (media)|Easter egg]] guide.&lt;ref name="TitanFirstTenYears" /&gt; In May 2019, in conjunction with the release of the fourth ''Avengers'' film, a two-volume book, also titled ''Marvel Studios: The First Ten Years'', will be released, written by Tara Bennett and Paul Terry. This collection will feature a look at the evolution of Marvel Studios, personal stories from all 22 films released at the time, and interviews with cast and crew members.&lt;ref name="TwoVolumeFirstTenYears" /&gt;

===''A Mini Marvel''===
In February 2016, a commercial for [[Coca-Cola]] mini cans aired during [[Super Bowl 50]]. ''A Mini Marvel'' was created by [[Wieden+Kennedy]] for Coca-Cola through a partnership with Marvel, and was directed by the [[Russo brothers]].&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke2" /&gt; In the ad, [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] (voiced by [[Paul Rudd]], reprising his role) and the Hulk first fight, and then bond, over a Coke mini can.&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke" /&gt; [[Luma Pictures]] provided visual effects for the spot, having worked previously with the two characters in MCU films. For the Hulk, Luma redefined its previous muscular system and simulation process to create and render the character, while Ant-Man received new motion capture.&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke2" /&gt; The Super Bowl campaign extended to "limited-edition Coke mini cans [six packs] that are emblazoned with images of Marvel characters, including Hulk, Ant-Man, Black Widow, [Falcon, Iron Man] and Captain America." Consumers had the opportunity to purchase the cans by finding hidden clues in the commercial, though "if the program goes well, Coke will consider making the cans available in stores."&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke" /&gt; The ad had the third most social media activity of all the film-related trailers that aired during the game,&lt;ref name="DeadlineCoke" /&gt; and was nominated for Outstanding Visual Effects in a Commercial at the [[Visual Effects Society Awards 2016|15th Visual Effects Society Awards]].&lt;ref name="MiniMarvelVESNom" /&gt;

'''National Book Tokens''' are a [[book token]] that is available in the UK and Ireland. They are solely owned and issued by Book Tokens Ltd (part of the Booksellers Association Group of Companies).

National Book Tokens are sold and accepted for exchange in almost all UK bookshops, including all major chains. The NBT scheme also sponsors the UK and Irish [[World Book Day]], as well as other literary events and awards such as ''The Telegraph'' Book Club Tour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/linlithgow-bookshop-selected-telegraph-tour.html|title=Linlithgow Bookshop selected for Telegraph tour - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global Reads&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1003/S00214.htm|title=Once Were Warriers Breaks Through To Top Ten - Scoop News|website=www.scoop.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the ''Daily Mail'' Book Club&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/books/article-318204/Mails-book-choice-storms-bestsellers-list.html|title=Mail's first book choice storms up bestsellers list|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Books Are My Bag Readers' Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nationalbooktokens.com/readers-awards|title=National Book Tokens|website=National Book Tokens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Book Tokens scheme was established in 1932, by publisher Harry Raymond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/nov/17/weekend.lucymangan|title=An appreciation of a token|first=Lucy|last=Mangan|date=17 November 2007|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original format of the tokens was as "lick-and-stick" stamp-like vouchers, which were glued into gift cards and had to be removed by the bookseller redeeming the token. In the 1990s, this design was changed to a "currency-style" voucher, available in a number of different denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalbooktokens.com/about-us/gallery/Brief-History.aspx|title=National Book Tokens|website=National Book Tokens}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a redesign in 2003 the Book Tokens scheme was relaunched as National Book Tokens, with new vouchers designed by LMC Design. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/rss/186570/Book-Tokens-unveils-redesign-ahead-national-push/|title=Campaign: marketing, advertising and media news &amp; analysis|website=www.marketingmagazine.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the paper vouchers were phased out. They were replaced by National Book Token [[gift card|gift cards]] which were identified by a [[bar code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/busy-first-day-electronic-gift-cards.html?quicktabs_1=0|title='Busy' first day for electronic gift cards - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Two dancers.jpg|thumb|[[Dance]] is a type of performance art practiced all over the world.]]
{{Performing arts}}
'''Performing arts''' are a form of [[art]] in which artists use their voices, bodies or inanimate objects to convey artistic expression. It is different from [[visual arts]], which is when artists use paint, canvas or various materials to create physical or static [[works of art|art objects]]. Performing arts include a range of disciplines which are performed in front of a live audience.

[[Theatre]], [[music]], [[dance]] and [[object manipulation]], and other kinds of [[performance]]s are present in all human cultures. The [[history of music]] and [[history of dance|dance]] date to [[pre-historic times]] whereas [[circus skills]] date to at least [[Ancient Egypt]]. Many performing arts are performed professionally. Performance can be in purpose built buildings, such as theatres and opera houses, on open air stages at festivals, on stages in tents such as circuses and on the street.

Live performances before an audience are a form of [[entertainment]]. The development of [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] and [[video]] recording has allowed for private consumption of the performing arts.

The performing arts often aim to express one's emotions and feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oliver|first=Sophie Anne|title= Trauma, Bodies, and Performance Art: Towards an Embodied Ethics of Seeing |journal=EBSCOhost |date=February 2010|volume=24|pages=119–129|doi=10.1080/10304310903362775}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performers==
Artists who participate in performing arts in front of an audience are called performers. Examples of these include [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, [[Magic (illusion)|magicians]], [[circus|circus artists]], [[musician]]s, and [[singer]]s. Performing arts are also supported by workers in related fields, such as [[songwriting]], [[choreography]] and [[stagecraft]].

{{anchor|Triple threat}}A performer who excels in acting, singing, and dancing is commonly referred to as a '''''triple threat'''''.&lt;ref name="romano"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Romano|first1=Tricia|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2011/03/30/natalie-portman-black-swan-and-the-death-of-the-hollywood-triple-threat.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=3 April 2015|title=Natalie Portman, Black Swan, and the Death of the 'Triple Threat'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known examples of historical triple threat artists include [[Gene Kelly]], [[Fred Astaire]], and [[Judy Garland]].&lt;ref name="romano" /&gt;

Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]], such as with [[costume]]s and [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], [[stage lighting]], and sound.

==Types==
Performing arts may include [[dance]], [[music]], [[opera]], [[theatre]] and [[musical theatre]], [[Magic (illusion)|magic]], [[illusion]], [[mime]], [[spoken word]], [[puppetry]], [[circus arts]], [[performance art]].

There is also a specialized form of [[fine art]], in which the artists ''perform'' their work live to an audience. This is called [[performance art]]. Most performance art also involves some form of plastic art, perhaps in the creation of [[Theatrical property|props]]. Dance was often referred to as a ''plastic art'' during the [[Modern dance]] era.&lt;ref name="dance"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackrell|first1=Judith R. |title= dance |journal= Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|date= May 19, 2017|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/dance/Types-of-dance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dance"/&gt;

===Theatre===
{{main|Theatre}}
Theatre is the branch of performing arts; concerned with [[acting]] out stories in front of an audience, using a combination of speech, gesture, music, dance, sound and spectacle. Any one or more of these elements is performing arts. In addition to the standard narrative dialogue style of plays. Theatre takes such forms as [[Play (theatre)|plays]], [[Musical theatre|musicals]], [[opera]], [[ballet]], [[illusion]], [[mime artist|mime]], [[classical Indian dance]], [[kabuki]], [[Mummers Play|mummers' plays]], [[improvisational theatre]], [[stand-up comedy]], [[pantomime]], and non-conventional or contemporary forms like [[postmodern theatre]], [[postdramatic theatre]], or [[performance art]].

===Dance===
{{main|Dance}}
[[File:NatalieBöckNussknacker.jpg|thumb|A [[ballerina]] [[en pointe]].]]
In the context of performing arts, [[dance]] generally refers to human [[Motion (physics)|movement]], typically rhythmic and to music, used as a form of audience entertainment in a [[performance]] setting. Definitions of what constitutes [[dance]] are dependent on [[Society|social]], [[Culture|cultural]], [[aesthetic]] [[artistic]] and [[moral]] constraints and range from functional movement (such as [[folk dance]]) to codified, [[virtuoso]] techniques such as [[ballet]].&lt;ref name="mackrell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mackrell|first1=Judith|title=Dance|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/150714/dance|website=britannica.com|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is one another modern form of dance that emerged in 19th- 20th century with the name of Free-Dance style. This form of dance was structured to create a harmonious personality which included features such as physical and spiritual freedom. [[Isadora Duncan]] was the first female dancer who argued about “woman of future” and developed novel vector of choreography using [[Nietzsche]]’s idea of “supreme mind in free mind”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nana|first1=Loria|title= Philosophical Context of Contemporary Choreographic Space|journal= EBSCOhost |date=June 30, 2015|volume=11|pages=64–67|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=111021227&amp;site=ehost-live. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance is a powerful impulse, but the art of dance is that impulse channeled by skillful performers into something that becomes intensely expressive and that may delight spectators who feel no wish to dance themselves. These two concepts of the art of dance—dance as a powerful impulse and dance as a skillfully choreographed art practiced largely by a professional few—are the two most important connecting ideas running through any consideration of the subject. In dance, the connection between the two concepts is stronger than in some other arts, and neither can exist without the other.&lt;ref name="mackrell" /&gt;

[[Choreography]] is the art of making dances, and the person who practices this art is called a choreographer.

===Music===
{{main|Music}}
Music is an art form which combines [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], [[rhythm]], and [[Dynamics (music)|dynamic]] in order to create sound. It can be performed using a variety of instruments and styles and is divided into genres such as [[Folk music|folk]], [[jazz]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[Rock music|rock]], etc. As an art form, music can occur in live or recorded formats, and can be [[Rehearsal|planned]] or [[Musical improvisation|improvised.]]
[[File:Bildhuggarkonst, Sofokles, Nordisk familjebok.png|right|thumb|upright=0.6|[[Sophocles]], as depicted in the [[Nordisk familjebok]].]] As music is a protean art, it easily co-ordinates with words for songs as physical movements do in dance. Moreover, it has a capability of shaping human behaviors as it impacts our emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Epperson|first1=Gordan |title= music |journal= Encyclopædia Britannica, inc.|date= April 11, 2016|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/music }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== &lt;!-- "History of the perming arts" redirects to here --&gt;

===History of Western performing arts===
{{main|Western art history}}{{See also|Antitheatricality}}
Starting in the 6th century BC, the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] of performing art began in [[Greece]], ushered in by the tragic poets such as [[Sophocles]]. These poets wrote plays which, in some cases, incorporated dance (see [[Euripides]]). The [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]] began the widespread use of [[comedy]].

However, by the 6th century AD, Western performing arts had been largely ended, as the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] began. Between the 9th century and 14th century, performing art in the West was limited to religious historical enactments and [[morality play]]s, organized by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]] in celebration of holy days and other important events.

====Renaissance====
{{main|Renaissance}}

In the 15th century performing arts, along with the arts in general, saw a revival as the Renaissance began in [[Italy]] and spread throughout [[Europe]] plays, some of which incorporated dance, which were performed and [[Domenico da Piacenza]] credited with the first use of the term ''ballo'' (in ''De Arte Saltandi et Choreas Ducendi'') instead of ''danza'' (dance) for his ''baletti'' or ''balli''. The term eventually became ''[[Ballet]]''. The first Ballet ''per se'' is thought to be [[Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx]]'s [[Ballet Comique de la Reine]] (1581).
[[File:Jan Miel – Actors from the Commedia dell’Arte on a Wagon in a Town Square.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|''[[Commedia dell'arte]] troupe on a wagon'', by [[Jan Miel]], 1640]]

By the mid-16th century [[Commedia Dell'arte]] became popular in Europe, introducing the use of [[improvisation]]. This period also introduced the [[Elizabethan masque]], featuring music, dance and elaborate costumes as well as professional theatrical companies in [[England]]. [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays in the late 16th century developed from this new class of professional performance.

In 1597, the first [[opera]], [[Dafne]] was performed and throughout the 17th century, opera would rapidly become the entertainment of choice for the [[aristocracy]] in most of Europe, and eventually for large numbers of people living in cities and towns throughout Europe.

====Modern Era====

The introduction of the [[proscenium arch]] in Italy during the 17th century established the traditional theatre form that persists to this day. Meanwhile, in England, the [[Puritans]] forbade acting, bringing a halt to performing arts that lasted until 1660. After that, women began to appear in both [[French language|French]] and English plays. The French introduced a formal dance instruction in the late 17th century.

It is also during this time that the first plays were performed in the [[American Colonies]].

During the 18th century, the introduction of the popular [[comic opera|opera buffa]] brought opera to the masses as an accessible form of performance. [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' are landmarks of the late 18th century opera.

At the turn of the 19th century, [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] and the [[Romantic movement]] ushered in a new era that led first to the spectacles of [[grand opera]] and then to the musical dramas of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and the [[Gesamtkunstwerk]] (total work of art) of the operas of [[Richard Wagner]] leading directly to the music of the 20th century.

The 19th century was a period of growth for the performing arts for all social classes, technical advances such as the introduction of [[Gas lighting|gaslight]] to theatres, [[burlesque]], minstrel dancing, and variety theatre. In ballet, women make great progress in the previously male-dominated art.

[[File:Isadora Duncan (grayscale).jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Isadora Duncan]], one of the developers of [[free dance]].]]
[[Modern dance]] began in the late 19th century and early 20th century in response to the restrictions of traditional ballet.

[[Konstantin Stanislavski]]'s [[Stanislavski System|"System"]] revolutionized acting in the early 20th century, and continues to have a major influence on actors of stage and screen to the current day. Both [[impressionism]] and modern realism were introduced to the stage during this period.

The arrival of [[Sergei Diaghilev]]'s [[Ballets Russes]] (1909–1929) revolutionized ballet and the performing arts generally throughout the Western world, most importantly through Diaghilev's emphasis on collaboration, which brought choreographers, dancers, set designers/artists, composers and musicians together to revitalize and revolutionize ballet. It is extremely complex.

With the invention of the [[film|motion picture]] in the late 19th century by [[Thomas Edison]] and the growth of the [[Cinema of the United States|motion picture industry in Hollywood]] in the early 20th century, film became a dominant performance medium throughout the 20th and 21st centuries.

[[Rhythm and blues]], a cultural phenomenon of black America, became to prominence in the early 20th century; influencing a range of later popular music styles internationally.

In the 1930s [[Jean Rosenthal]] introduced what would become modern [[stage lighting]], changing the nature of the stage as the [[Broadway musical]] became a phenomenon in the United States.

====Post-War performance====
Post-World War II performing arts were highlighted by the resurgence of both ballet and opera in the Western world.

[[File:Street Theatre Show, La Chaux-de-Fonds.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Modern street theatre performance in La Chaux-de-Fonds]]
[[Postmodernism]] in performing arts dominated the 1960s to large extent.

===History of Eastern performing arts===

====Middle East====
The earliest recorded theatrical event dates back to 2000 BC with the [[passion plays]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. This story of the god [[Osiris]] was performed annually at festivals throughout the civilization, marking the known beginning of a long relationship between theatre and religion.

The most popular forms of [[theater]] in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]] were [[puppet]] theatre (which included hand puppets, [[shadow play]]s and [[marionette]] productions) and live [[passion play]]s known as ''ta'ziya'', where actors re-enact episodes from [[Muslim history]]. In particular, [[Shia Islam]]ic [[Play (theatre)|plays]] revolved around the ''[[Shahid|shaheed]]'' (martyrdom) of [[Ali]]'s sons [[Hasan ibn Ali]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali]]. Live secular plays were known as ''akhraja'', recorded in medieval ''[[Adab (behavior)|adab]]'' literature, though they were less common than puppetry and ''ta'ziya'' theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Moreh |first=Shmuel |authorlink=Shmuel Moreh |contribution=Live Theater in Medieval Islam |title=Studies in Islamic History and Civilization |editor-last=David Ayalon |editor-first=[[Moshe Sharon]] |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |year=1986 |isbn=965-264-014-X |pages=565–601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
In [[Iran]] there are other forms of theatrical events such as ''Naghali'' (story telling), ''ٰRu-Howzi'', ''[[Siah-Bazi]]'', ''Parde-Khani, ''''[[Mareke giri]]''.

====India and Pakistan====
{{main|Theatre in India|Theatre in Pakistan|Sanskrit drama}}

Folk theatre and dramatics can be traced to the religious ritualism of the [[Vedic period|Vedic peoples]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]]. This folk theatre of the misty past was mixed with dance, food, ritualism, plus a depiction of events from daily life. The last element made it the origin of the classical theatre of later times. Many historians, notably D. D. Kosambi, Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya, Adya Rangacharaya, etc. have referred to the prevalence of ritualism amongst [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] tribes in which some members of the tribe acted as if they were wild animals and some others were the hunters. Those who acted as mammals like goats, buffaloes, reindeer, monkeys, etc. were chased by those playing the role of hunters.

[[Bharata Muni]] (fl. 5th–2nd century BC) was an ancient Indian writer best known for writing the ''[[Natya Shastra of Bharata]]'', a theoretical treatise on Indian performing arts, including [[theatre]], [[dance]], [[acting]], and [[music]], which has been compared to [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''. Bharata is often known as the father of Indian theatrical arts. His ''Natya Shastra'' seems to be the first attempt to develop the technique or rather art, of drama in a systematic manner. The Natya Shastra tells us not only what is to be portrayed in a drama, but how the portrayal is to be done. Drama, as Bharata Muni says, is the imitation of men and their doings (''loka-vritti''). As men and their doings have to be respected on the stage, so drama in Sanskrit is also known by the term ''roopaka'', which means portrayal.

The ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' can be considered the first recognized plays that originated in India. These epics provided the inspiration to the earliest Indian dramatists and they do it even today. Indian dramatists such as [[Bhāsa]] in the 2nd century BC wrote plays that were heavily inspired by the ''Ramayana'' and ''Mahabharata''.

[[Kālidāsa]] in the 1st century BC, is arguably considered to be ancient [[India]]'s greatest dramatist. Three famous romantic plays written by Kālidāsa are the ''[[Mālavikāgnimitram]]'' (''Mālavikā and Agnimitra''), ''[[Vikramōrvaśīyam]]'' (''Pertaining to Vikrama and Urvashi''), and ''[[The Recognition of Sakuntala|Abhijñānaśākuntala]]'' (''The Recognition of Shakuntala''). The last was inspired by a story in the ''Mahabharata'' and is the most famous. It was the first to be translated into [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]]. In comparison to Bhāsa, who drew heavily from the epics, Kālidāsa can be considered an original [[playwright]].

The next great Indian dramatist was [[Bhavabhuti]] (c. 7th century). He is said to have written the following three plays: ''Malati-Madhava'', ''[[Mahaviracharita]]'' and ''Uttar Ramacharita''. Among these three, the last two cover between them, the entire epic of ''Ramayana''. The powerful Indian emperor [[Harsha]] (606–648) is credited with having written three plays: the comedy ''[[Ratnavali]]'', ''[[Priyadarsika]]'', and the [[Buddhist]] drama ''[[Nagananda]]''. Many other dramatists followed during the [[Middle Ages]].

There were many performing art forms in the southern part of India, Kerala is such a state with different such art forms like [[Koodiyattam]], [[Nangyarkoothu]], [[Kathakali]], [[Chakyar koothu]], [[Thirayattam]] and there were many prominent artists like [[Ramanchakyar|Painkulam Raman Chakyar]] and others.

====China====
{{main|Chinese theatre}}

There are references to theatrical entertainments in China as early as 1500 BC during the [[Shang Dynasty]]; they often involved music, clowning and acrobatic displays.

The Tang dynasty is sometimes known as "The Age of 1000 Entertainments". During this era, [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang China|Emperor Xuanzong]] formed an acting school known as the Children of the [[Pear Garden]] to produce a form of drama that was primarily musical.

During the Han Dynasty, [[shadow puppetry]] first emerged as a recognized form of theatre in China. There were two distinct forms of shadow puppetry, Cantonese southern and Pekingese northern. The two styles were differentiated by the method of making the puppets and the positioning of the rods on the puppets, as opposed to the type of play performed by the puppets. Both styles generally performed plays depicting great adventure and fantasy, rarely was this very stylized form of theatre used for political propaganda. Cantonese shadow puppets were the larger of the two. They were built using thick leather that created more substantial shadows. Symbolic color was also very prevalent; a black face represented honesty, a red one bravery. The rods used to control Cantonese puppets were attached perpendicular to the puppets' heads. Thus, they were not seen by the audience when the shadow was created. Pekingese puppets were more delicate and smaller. They were created out of thin, translucent leather usually taken from the belly of a donkey. They were painted with vibrant paints, thus they cast a very colorful shadow. The thin rods that controlled their movements were attached to a leather collar at the neck of the puppet. The rods ran parallel to the bodies of the puppet then turned at a ninety degree angle to connect to the neck. While these rods were visible when the shadow was cast, they laid outside the shadow of the puppet; thus they did not interfere with the appearance of the figure. The rods attached at the necks to facilitate the use of multiple heads with one body. When the heads were not being used, they were stored in a muslin book or fabric lined box. The heads were always removed at night. This was in keeping with the old superstition that if left intact, the puppets would come to life at night. Some puppeteers went so far as to store the heads in one book and the bodies in another, to further reduce the possibility of reanimating puppets. Shadow puppetry is said to have reached its highest point of artistic development in the 11th century before becoming a tool of the government.

In the [[Song dynasty]], there were many popular plays involving [[acrobatic]]s and [[music]]. These developed in the [[Yuan Dynasty]] into a more sophisticated form with a four- or five-act structure. Yuan drama spread across China and diversified into numerous regional forms, the best known of which is Beijing Opera, which is still popular today.

In [[Thailand]], it has been a tradition from the Middle Ages to stage plays based on plots drawn from Indian epics. In particular, the theatrical version of Thailand's national epic ''[[Ramakien]]'', a version of the Indian ''[[Ramayana]]'', remains popular in Thailand even today.

====Cambodia====
In [[Cambodia]], at the ancient capital [[Angkor Wat]], stories from the Indian epics ''Ramayana'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]'' have been carved on the walls of temples and palaces. Similar reliefs are found at [[Borobudur]] in [[Indonesia]].

====Japan====
{{main|Noh|Bunraku|Kabuki|Butoh}}

During the 14th century, there were small companies of actors in Japan who performed short, sometimes vulgar comedies. A director of one of these companies, Kan'ami (1333–1384), had a son, [[Zeami Motokiyo]] (1363–1443) who was considered one of the finest child actors in Japan. When Kan'ami's company performed for [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] (1358–1408), the Shogun of Japan, he implored Zeami to have a court education for his arts. After Zeami succeeded his father, he continued to perform and adapt his style into what is today [[Noh]]. A mixture of [[pantomime]] and vocal acrobatics, this style has fascinated the Japanese for hundreds of years.

Japan, after a long period of civil wars and political disarray, was unified and at peace primarily due to shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu (1600–1668). However, alarmed at increasing Christian growth, he cut off contact from Japan to Europe and China and outlawed Christianity. When peace did come, a flourish of cultural influence and growing merchant class demanded its own entertainment. The first form of theatre to flourish was Ningyō jōruri (commonly referred to as [[Bunraku]]). The founder of and main contributor to Ningyō jōruri, [[Chikamatsu Monzaemon]] (1653–1725), turned his form of theatre into a true art form. Ningyō jōruri is a highly stylized form of theatre using puppets, today about 1/3d the size of a human. The men who control the puppets train their entire lives to become master puppeteers, when they can then operate the puppet's head and right arm and choose to show their faces during the performance. The other puppeteers, controlling the less important limbs of the puppet, cover themselves and their faces in a black suit, to imply their invisibility. The dialogue is handled by a single person, who uses varied tones of voice and speaking manners to simulate different characters. Chikamatsu wrote thousands of plays during his lifetime, most of which are still used today.

Kabuki began shortly after Bunraku, legend has it by an actress named Okuni, who lived around the end of the 16th century. Most of Kabuki's material came from Nõ and Bunraku, and its erratic dance-type movements are also an effect of Bunraku. However, Kabuki is less formal and more distant than Nõ, yet very popular among the Japanese public. Actors are trained in many varied things including dancing, singing, pantomime, and even acrobatics. Kabuki was first performed by young girls, then by young boys, and by the end of the 16th century, Kabuki companies consisted of all men. The men who portrayed women on stage were specifically trained to elicit the essence of a woman in their subtle movements and gestures.

==Heart rate during performances==
During different types of performances, the heart rate varies significantly. For example, studies have been done that show that [[heart rate]] varies throughout the different stages of a speech, which include leading up to a speaking role (the highest heart rate occurs during this stage), during the speaking role, and after the [[speaking]] role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baldwin|first1=Sandra|title=Effect of Speakers' Sex and Size of Audience on Heart-Rate Changes During Short Impromptu Speeches|journal=Psychological Reports|date=1980|volume=46|pages=123–130|doi=10.2466/pr0.1980.46.1.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar changes in heart rate also occur during [[acting]], relating to [[stress (psychological)|stress]]. The high heart rates can be attributed to the stress caused by anticipation. During a [[performance]] with an [[audience]], the actor experiences high levels of stress throughout the performance, as it pushes the [[actor]]s mentally. However, this stress helps the actor have a stronger performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Konijn|first1=Elly|title=Psychology and Performing Arts|date=1991|publisher=Sweets and Zeitlinger|isbn=9026511191|pages=59–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar changes in heart rate occur for [[musician]]s during their performance. Though their heart rate is highest while they are musically performing, their heart rate is higher during the pre-performance phase, than during the post-performance phase, which is attributed to the stress caused by [[anticipation]]. The anticipation leading up to a performance, causes heart rate to increase, while the relief after a performance, causes the heart rate to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Studer|first1=Regina Katharina|title=Psychophysiological Activation During Preparation, Performance, and Recovery in High- and Low-Anxious Music Students|journal=Apple Psychophyiol Biofeedback|date=January 30, 2014|volume=39|pages=45–57|doi=10.1007/s10484-014-9240-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10612">'''Rachel Gadsden''' is a UK-based [[visual artist]] and [[performance artist]] who is exhibited internationally and who works across the mainstream and [[disability art]] sectors. Gadsden has led a range of national and international participative programmes exploring themes of fragility and resilience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gadsden|first1=Rachel|title=Disability Arts International|url=http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/rachel-gadsden/|website=Disability Arts International|publisher=British Council|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has had a lung condition all her life and is injected by a syringe driver at one-minute intervals with the medication she needs to keep her alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gadsden|first1=Rachel|title=Push Me Please|url=http://www.pushmeplease.co.uk/biographical-information-rachel-gadsden/|website=Push Me Please|publisher=Watershed|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Gadsden's artistic career began with the support of a [[Prince's Trust|Prince's Youth Business Trust Award]] (1988). Gadsden received a BA (Hons) Fine Art Painting from [[Wimbledon School of Art]] in 1998, an Anatomy for Artists Diploma from UCH Medical School, London in 2000 and MA Fine Art, [[City and Guilds of London Art School]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gadsden|first1=Rachel|url=http://www.rachelgadsden.com/rg-about|title=Homepage|website=Rachel Gadsden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wsimag.com/art/1365-rachel-gadsden|title=Wall Street International|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=Wall Street International Art Section|publisher=Wall Street International|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gadsden’s artistic process explores the physical, historical and personal experience of aspects of the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=GV Art London Catalogue|last=Devcic|first=Robert|publisher=GV Art London|year=2012|isbn=978-0-9575418-1-8|location=London|pages= |page=6|quote="...explores the human condition and gives voice to the notions of fragility, survival and hope."|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experimenting with what the artist calls a [[Psychogeography|psycho-geographical]] approach she explored the derelict asylum Cane Hill in Surrey in 2005. In documenting the process Tim Hayton said: “Rachel's mixed media paintings, drawings, projections and videos attempt to capture the building's struggle to survive and its inevitable physical demise, the decay being a tangible evocation of our own psychological ephemerality.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsonline.org.uk/rachel-gadsden-beyond-the-asylum|title=Disability Arts Online|last=Hayton|first=Tim|date=1 October 2005|website=Disability Arts Online|publisher=Disability Arts Online|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Gadsden received an Artsadmin Digital Media Bursary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.artsadmin.co.uk/artist-development/featured/artists-bursary-scheme|title=Artsadmin|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=Artsadmin|publisher=Artsadmin|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to develop a project narrating a history of [[North Wales Hospital]] in Denbigh. Ten years after the closure of the hospital an exhibition of her artwork Beyond the Asylum was shown in Denbigh Museum and Library, North Wales (2005)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/4209506.stm|title=BBC News|last=|first=|date=3 September 2005|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Faith Gallery, Holton Lee, Dorset (2006).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rachelgadsden.com/rg-about|title=Rachel Gadsden|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=Artists' About Page|publisher=|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011/12 Gadsden exhibited [[Ubuntu (philosophy)|Ubuntu]] as part of a GV Art London Group Show 'TRAUMA: The Art and Science of Trauma'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvart.co.uk/trauma.html|title=GV Art London|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=GV Art Trauma Group Show|publisher=GV Art London|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was in line with GV Art’s commitment to support artists who generate meaningful collaborations and dialogues with scientists to investigate the human condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gvart.co.uk/about-2.html|title=GV Art London|last=|first=|date=|website=GV Art London ABOUT page|publisher=GV Art London|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gadsden exhibited artwork from her initial collaboration with The Bambanini Group of Khayelitsha Township investigating the experience of living with HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=TRAUMA: The Art and Science of Trauma|last=|first=|publisher=GV Art|year=2011|isbn=978-0-9563783-6-1|location=London|pages=49–52|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition also included Luke Jerram’s glass microbiology sculptures of HIV.

In 2012 Gadsden won an award from the Arts Council’s Unlimited&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscouncil.org.uk/funding/unlimited-iii|title=ACE|last=|first=|date=|website=Arts Council|publisher=Arts Council England|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; programme, designed to support disabled artists across the UK to create ambitious work covering all genres.

Working with the Bambanani Group in South Africa, Unlimited Global Alchemy explored the psychology and politics of HIV/AIDS through a series of collaborative artworks, film and workshops. Work from the project is now permanently exhibited in Mandela’s Walk to Freedom in Cape Town.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rachelgadsden.com/rg-about|title=Rachel Gadsden About Page|last=Gadsden|first=Rachel|date=21 October 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Luke Jennings in a Guardian review of Gadsden's project Unlimited Global Alchemy said: “Gadsden is creating an artwork with frantic speed, fighting her own real-life fight against the dying of the light. In the act of painting, she tells us, she is "living in the second". A profoundly affecting reminder of our shared humanity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jennings|first1=Luke|title=Unlimited Global Academy – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/09/unlimited-global-academy-livid-review|accessdate=3 December 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 an exhibition catalogue of Unlimited Global Academy was published by Artsadmin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unlimited Global Alchemy|last=Mitchelson|first=Andrew|publisher=Artsadmin|year=2012|isbn=0956562140|location=London|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; containing a series of essays on the work of the artist and written accounts as well as short talking heads films (on a CD accompanying the catalogue) of the personal and political journeys made by each of the Bambanani Group Members to counter discrimination experienced by people with AIDS/ HIV in South Africa. The catalogue for Unlimited Global Academy contains a foreword by author and Oxford University African Studies lecturer [[Jonny Steinberg]] who describes the project as the “product of a highly unusual consciousness.” Steinberg, citing Gadsden’s recognition of [http://www.memorybox.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12 Bambanani Group] Member, Nodumiso Hlwele’s motivation to create art as a way of managing chronic illness as a starting point for the collaboration. Steinberg goes on to say: “And not just unusual… but also important. For at a purely pragmatic level, those who make public works from this particular chronic illness, AIDS - be it in the form of art or advocacy or mass campaigns - are responsible for bringing these precious pills to countless people in the first place. Aside from producing powerful works for our contemplation, Gadsden, Hlwele and the rest of the Bambanani Group are also keeping a vital political matter alive.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unlimited Global Alchemy|last=Mitchelson|first=Andrew|last2=Steinberg|publisher=Artsadmin|year=2012|isbn=9780956562142|location=London|page=9|quote=Jonny Steinberg|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the Qatari Government's UK Year of Culture featured "This Breathing World", a major solo exhibition of 54 artworks &amp; films as part of the first ever Art &amp; Disability Festival in the Middle East at [[Katara Cultural Village]], Doha.&lt;ref name="DAI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disabilityartsinternational.org/artists/profiles/rachel-gadsden/|title=Disability Arts International|publisher=British Council|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Gadsden was commissioned by the [[UK Parliament]] to create artwork as part of [http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/2015-parliament-in-the-making/get-involved1/2015-banners-exhibition/ ‘The Beginnings of that Freedome’] exhibition, which were gifted to organisations across the UK in January 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/visiting/visiting-parliament-news/parliament-gifts-original-commemorative-banners-to-organisations-across-the-uk/|title=UK Parliament|last=|first=|date=21 January 2016|website=UK Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 18 Banners were commissioned by Parliament to celebrate 800 years since [[Magna Carta Libertatum|Magna Carta]] was sealed and the 750th Birthday of the Montfort Parliament, including 2 banners by Gadsden ‘1601 Poor Law’ and ‘1829 Catholic Emancipation Act’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/evolutionofparliament/2015-parliament-in-the-making/get-involved1/2015-banners-exhibition/rachel-gadsden/|title=UK Parliament Westminster Hall banner exhibition|last=|first=|date=21 October 2016|website=UK Parliament|publisher=UK Parliament|access-date=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cover of 'Revue et Gazette musicale de Paris' 1835 vol2 n46 - Internet Archive.jpg|thumb|Cover of ''Revue et Gazette Musicale de Paris'' (15 November 1835)]]

The '''''{{Lang|fr|Revue musicale}}''''' was a weekly musical review founded in 1827 by the Belgian [[musicologist]], teacher and composer [[François-Joseph Fétis]], then working as professor of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]] at the [[Conservatoire de Paris]]. It was the first French-language journal dedicated entirely to classical music. In November 1835 it merged with [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s '''''Gazette musicale de Paris''''' (first published in January 1834) to form '''''Revue et gazette musicale de Paris''''', first published on 1 November 1835. It ceased publication in 1880.

==History==
By 1830 the '''''Revue musicale''''', written and published by Fétis, was on sale at [[Maurice Schlesinger]]'s music seller's premises.&lt;ref name="RF_13-14"&gt;Vol 7 (Tome VIII, IV&lt;sup&gt;me&lt;/sup&gt; année) (1830) sold by Fétis, Alexandre Mesnier &amp; Schlesinger.

Schlesinger published editions of classical and modern music under his own name at a reasonable price, most notably works by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], [[Carl Maria von Weber|Weber]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]] and [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]]. He also published ''[[Robert le diable]]''&lt;ref&gt;Full score of Schlesinger's edition of [http://imslp.org/wiki/Robert_le_diable_%28Meyerbeer,_Giacomo%29 Robert le diable] at IMSLP.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' by [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], as well as ''[[La Juive]]'' by [[Fromental Halévy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} ''{{Lang|fr|Larousse encyclopédique}}'' vol. 9, p.&amp;nbsp;9405.&lt;/ref&gt; Schlesinger founded his own rival publication, the '''''Gazette Musicale de Paris''''', which first appeared on 5 January 1834.&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} {{cite book |title=Gazette Musicale de Paris |volume=I&lt;sup&gt;re&lt;/sup&gt; année, No. 1 |date=5 January 1834 |others= [[Maurice Schlesinger|Schlesinger, Maurice]] (ed.) |url=https://archive.org/stream/gazettemusicaled18341pari#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} ''{{Lang|fr|Dictionnaire de la musique}}'' Larousse, p.&amp;nbsp;286 {{ISBN|978-2-03-505545-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, Schlesinger bought the ''Revue musicale'' from Fétis and merged the two journals into the '''''Revue et gazette musicale de Paris'''''. He widened the subject matter of the ''{{Lang|fr|Gazette musicale}}'' from music itself to also include literature about music – in 1837 he commissioned from [[Honoré de Balzac]] for the ''Gazette'' the [[novella]] ''[[Gambara (short story)|Gambara]]'' (dealing with the new style of [[grand opera]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Fr icon}} René Guise, ''La Pléiade'', p.&amp;nbsp;1517.

The name ''Revue musicale'' returned for six months in 1839 as the '''''Revue musicale, journal des artistes, des amateurs et des théatres''''' while the journal was a bi-weekly publication. The list of contributors to the ''Revue et gazette musicale'' in 1840 included: [[François Benoist]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Castil-Blaze]], [[Antoine Elwart]], [[Stephen Heller]], [[Jules Janin]], [[Jean-Georges Kastner]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Édouard Monnais]] (director of the [[Paris Opera]] from 1839 to 1847), [[Joseph d'Ortigue]], [[Theodor Panofka]], [[Ludwig Rellstab]], [[Georges Sand]], [[Robert Schumann]], and one [[Richard Wagner]].

'''Robert Blair''' (17 April 1699 – 4 February 1746) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[poet]]. His fame rests upon his poem ''[[The Grave (poem)|The Grave]]'', which, in a later printing was illustrated by [[William Blake]].

==Biography==
[[File:William Blake - The Skeleton Reanimated.jpg|thumb|'The Skeleton Reanimated', one of [[William Blake]]'s illustrations for ''The Grave'']]
He was the eldest son of the Rev. Robert Blair, one of the king's chaplains, and was born at [[Edinburgh]]. He was educated at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and in the [[Netherlands]], and in 1731 was appointed to the living of Athelstaneford in [[East Lothian]]. In 1738, he married Isabella, daughter of Professor William Law, with whom he had six children. His family's wealth gave him leisure for his favourite pursuits: gardening and the study of English poets.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Blair published only three poems. One was a commemoration of his father-in-law and another was a translation. His reputation rests entirely on his third work, ''[[The Grave (poem)|The Grave]]'' (1743), which is a poem written in [[blank verse]] on the subject of death and the graveyard. It is much less conventional than its gloomy title might lead one to expect. Its religious subject no doubt contributed to its great popularity, especially in Scotland, where it gave rise to the so-called [[graveyard poets|"graveyard school" of poetry]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The poem extends to 767 lines of various merit, in some passages rising to great sublimity, and in others sinking to commonplace.

The poem is now best known for the illustrations created by [[William Blake]] following a commission from [[Robert Cromek]]. Blake's designs were engraved by [[Luigi Schiavonetti]], and published in 1808.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

See the biographical introduction prefixed to Blair's ''Poetical Works'', by Dr. Robert Anderson, in his ''Poets of Great Britain'', vol. viii. (1794). The only modern edition of ''The Grave'' is that of Professor James A. Means, which was published in 1973 by the Augustan Reprint Society, Los Angeles.

'''''The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night''''' (1885), subtitled '''''A Plain and Literal Translation of the Arabian Nights Entertainments''''', is an English language translation of ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' (the “Arabian Nights”) – a collection of Middle Eastern and South Asian stories and folk tales compiled in Arabic during the [[Islamic Golden Age]] (8th−13th centuries) – by the British explorer and [[Arabist]] [[Richard Francis Burton]] (1821–1890). It stood as the only complete translation of the Macnaghten or Calcutta II edition (Egyptian recension) of the "Arabian Nights" until the Malcolm C. and Ursula Lyons translation in 2008.

Burton's translation was one of two unabridged and unexpurgated English translations done in the 1880s; the first was by [[John Payne (poet)|John Payne]], under the title ''The Book of the Thousand Nights and One Night'' (1882–84, nine volumes). Burton's ten volume version was published almost immediately afterward with a slightly different title. This, along with the fact that Burton closely advised Payne and partially based his books on Payne's, led later to charges of [[plagiarism]].&lt;ref&gt;Sallis, Eva (1999), ''Scheherazade Through the Looking-Glass: The Metamorphosis of the Thousand and One Nights'' (Routledge),  pg 4 and ''[[passim]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclo&gt;Marzolph, Ulrich and Richard van Leeuwen. 2004. ''The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia'', Volume 1, pp 506–508.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] imagery in the source texts (which Burton made a special study of, adding extensive footnotes and appendices on "Oriental" sexual mores)&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt; and to the strict [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] laws on obscene material, both translations were printed as private editions for subscribers only, rather than being published in the usual manner. Burton's original ten volumes were followed by a further six entitled '''''The Supplemental Nights to the Thousand Nights and a Night''''' (1886–88). Burton's 16 volumes, while boasting many prominent admirers, have been criticised for their "archaic language and extravagant idiom" and "obsessive focus on sexuality"; they have even been called an "eccentric ego-trip" and a "highly personal reworking of the text".&lt;ref name=encyclo/&gt; His voluminous and obscurely detailed notes and appendices have been characterised as “obtrusive, kinky and highly personal”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Irwin (writer)|Irwin, Robert]] (1994), "The Arabian Nights: A Companion", Allen Lane: The Penguin Press, pg 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) began naming features on [[Saturn]]'s moon [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]] after characters and places in Burton's translation&lt;ref name="NameCategories"&gt;Blue, J.; (2006) [http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/append6.html ''Categories for Naming Planetary Features'']. Retrieved 16 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; because “its surface is so strange and mysterious that it was given the ''Arabian Nights'' as a name bank, linking fantasy landscape with a literary fantasy”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/static/publications/IB104.pdf |title=Data |website=www.iau.org |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[List of geological features on Enceladus]].)

==Background==
Burton – an accomplished [[geographer]], explorer, [[oriental studies|orientalist]], [[ethnologist]], diplomat, [[linguistics|polylinguist]] and author – was best known in his lifetime for travelling in disguise to [[Mecca]] (1853) and for journeying (with [[John Hanning Speke]]) as the first European to visit the [[African Great Lakes|Great Lakes]] of Africa in search of the source of the [[Nile river|Nile]] (1857–58). One of the great Arabists of his day, he had long wanted to publish an unexpurgated version of the "Arabian Nights" stories. The first translations into English, notably that by [[Edward William Lane|Edward Lane]] (1840, 1859), were highly abridged and heavily [[bowdlerised]], which irritated Burton.

In 1863 Burton co-founded the ''[[Anthropological Society of London]]'' with Dr. [[James Hunt (speech therapist)|James Hunt]]. In Burton's own words, the main aim of the society (through the publication of the periodical ''Anthropologia'') was "to supply travelers with an organ that would rescue their observations from the outer darkness of manuscript and print their curious information on social and sexual matters". Burton had written numerous travel books which invariably included sexual curiosa in extensive footnotes and appendices. His best-known contributions to literature were those considered risqué or even pornographic at the time and which were published under the auspices of the "Kama Shastra Society", a fictitious organisation created by Burton and [[Forster Fitzgerald Arbuthnot]] as a legal device to avoid the consequences of [[Obscene Publications Act 1857|current obscenity laws]]. (Burton and Arbuthnot were the only members of the "Society".) These works included ''The [[Kama Sutra]] of Vatsyayana'' (1883), published just before his ''Nights'', and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden of the Shaykh Nefzawi]]'' (1886), published just after it.

The volumes were printed by the Kama Shastra Society in a subscribers-only edition of one thousand with a guarantee that there would never be a larger printing of the books in this form. To confound possible litigation, the title pages claimed the printing had been done in "[[Benares]]", but this was a subterfuge. In reality, it was done by Miller &amp; Richard (a Scottish firm) at Stoke Newington.&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|List of stories within One Thousand and One Nights}}

===Sexology===
The stories collected in the ''Nights'' are often sexual in content and were considered pornography at the time of Burton's publication. The ''Terminal Essay'' in volume 10 of Burton's ''Nights'' contains a 14,000-word section entitled "Pederasty" (Volume 10, section IV, D). Here Burton postulated that male homosexuality was prevalent in an area of the southern latitudes named by him the "[[Sotadic zone]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Richard Francis Burton Explorer of the Sotadic Zone|url=http://paganpressbooks.com/jpl/BURTON.HTM|work=Pagan Press|publisher=Pagan Press|accessdate=16 June 2012|author=Pagan Press|year=1982–2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Rumors about Burton's own sexuality and experiences were already circulating and were further incited by this work.)

==Plagiarism controversy==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
John Payne and Burton collaborated on their respective translations of the ''Nights'' for more than half a decade, and each respected the other's scholarship, but Payne believed that Burton had plagiarised his manuscripts when he sent them to Trieste to be checked.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, Mary S. (1998), ''A Rage to Live: A Biography of Richard and Isabel Burton'', New York/London: [[W.W. Norton]], pg 795.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, a biographer of Burton, [[Thomas Wright (biographer)|Thomas Wright]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Thomas|title=The Life of Sir Richard Burton|publisher=[[G. P. Putnam's Sons]]|location=New York|year=1906|volume=Vols. 1 and 2|url=http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/|isbn=1-4264-1455-2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013141137/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/b/burton/richard/b97zw/|archivedate=13 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the claim that Burton had plagiarised most of his translation from Payne. Burton's most recent biographer summarises the situation as follows.&lt;blockquote&gt;He [Wright] made a comparison of the respective versions of the ''Nights'' by Burton and Payne. We know, not only from Richard's and Isabel's writings but from the statements of people who met him through the years, that Burton had been collecting manuscripts of the ''Nights'' stories and translating them, on and off, for over twenty-five years before he met Payne. So Wright's claim that Burton had not done his own translation, but had "taken from Payne at least three-quarters of his entire work", is extraordinary.&lt;ref&gt;Lovell, ''Op. cit'', pp 795–796.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Norman Mosley Penzer]], in his 1923 ''Annotated Bibliography'' of Burton's works, takes great umbrage at "Wright's futile efforts to glorify Payne and scoff at Burton",&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Mosley Penzer|Penzer, Norman Mosley]] (1923), ''An Annotated Bibliography of Sir Richard Francis Burton'', London: A. M. Philpot, pg 319.&lt;/ref&gt; contradicting several of his examples point by point. In Burton's defence, Penzer asserts that it is usual for translators to study and follow in the footsteps of earlier translators and cites examples of similarities in the stories Payne translated {{em|after}} Burton had published his version.

The "plagiarism" allegation is also examined in detail in an appendix to [[Fawn Brodie]]’s 1967 biography of Burton, ''The Devil Drives''.

==Style==
In translating the ''Nights'', Burton attempted to invent an English equivalent of medieval Arabic. In doing so, he drew upon [[Middle English|Chaucerian English]], [[Elizabethan English]], and the 1653 English translation by Sir [[Thomas Urquhart]] of the first three books of [[Rabelais]]'s ''[[Gargantua and Pantagruel]]'' (1532-46).&lt;ref&gt;[[A.S. Byatt|Byatt, A.S.]] (1999), "Narrate or Die: Why Scheherazade Keeps on Talking", ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' (18 April issue).&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to British historian and Arabist [[Robert Irwin (writer)|Robert Irwin]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;Burton shared [John] Payne's enthusiasm for archaic and forgotten words. The style Burton achieved can be described as a sort of composite mock-Gothic, combining elements from [[Middle English]], the [[Authorized Version of the Bible]] and [[Jacobean drama]]. Most modern readers will also find Burton's Victorian vulgarisms jarring, for example ‘regular [[:wikt:Joe Miller|Joe Millers]]’, ‘[[:wikt:Charley|Charleys]]’, and ‘[[:wikt:red cent|red cent]]’. Burton's translation of the ''Nights'' can certainly be recommended to anyone wishing to increase their word-power:  ‘[[:wikt:chevisance|chevisance]]’, ‘[[:wikt:fortalice|fortalice]]’, ‘[[:wikt:kemper|kemperly]]’, ‘[[:wikt:cark|cark]]’, ‘[[:wikt:foison|foison]]’, ‘[[:wikt:soothfast|soothfast]]’, ‘[[:wikt:perlection|perlection]]’, ‘[[:wikt:wittol|wittol]]’, ‘[[:wikt:parergon|parergon]]’, ‘[[:wikt:brewis|brewis]]’, ‘bles’, ‘[[:wikt:fadaise|fadaise]]’, ‘[[:wikt:coelebs|coelebs]]’, ‘[[:wikt:vivisepulture|vivisepulture]]’, and so on. ‘[[:wikt:whilome|Whilome]]’ and ‘[[:wikt:anent|anent]]’ are standard in Burton's vocabulary. The range of vocabulary is wider and stranger than Payne's, lurching between the erudite and the plain earthy, so that [[Harun al-Rashid]] and [[Sinbad]] walk and talk in a linguistic [[Never Never Land]].&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, ''[[Op. cit.]]'' pg 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
Many early commentators on Burton's ''Nights'' criticised his eccentric "mixture of obsolete words, mediaeval phrases, modern slang, Americanisms, and foreign words and expressions".&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 319.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jorge Luis Borges]], however, wrote a celebrated essay on “The Translators of ''The Thousand and One Nights''”&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Borges, Jorge Luis (1999), ''Selected Non-Fictions'', Editor: [[Eliot Weinberger]]; Translators: [[Esther Allen]], [[Suzanne Jill Levine]], and Eliot Weinberger; New York: [[Viking Press|Viking]], pp 92–109. (This essay was originally published in 1936 as "Los traductores de las 1001 Noches" in ''Eternidad''.)&lt;/ref&gt; in which – while he chastises Burton for his distortions and "indulgent loitering" — he allows that “the problems that Burton resolved are innumerable”&lt;ref&gt;Borges, ''[[Op. cit.]]'', pg 99&lt;/ref&gt; and delights in his careful use of an extravagantly exotic vocabulary in which each word "is indubitably the ''[[Wikt:mot juste#English|mot juste]]''." In summarising his use of language, Borges concluded that “In some way, the almost inexhaustible process of English is adumbrated in Burton – [[John Donne]]’s hard obscenity, the gigantic vocabularies of [[Shakespeare]] and [[Cyril Tourneur]], [[Swinburne]]’s affinity for the archaic, the crass erudition of the authors of 17th century chapbooks, the energy and imprecision, the love of tempests and magic.”&lt;ref&gt;Borges, ''Op. cit.'', pg 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lady Burton's edition===
[[File:Lady Burton's Edition.jpg|thumb|Title page of Volume I of ''Lady Burton's Edition of Her Husband's Arabian Nights''.]]
*''Lady Burton's Edition of Her Husband's Arabian Nights Translated Literally from the Arabic'' (1886-1887); Prepared for Household Reading by [[Justin Huntly McCarthy]], M.P.; 6 vols.; London: Waterlow &amp; Sons, Limited, London Wall. 

:This edition is ostensibly the “family” version of Burton's translation. (In her "Preface", [[Lady Burton]] guarantees that "no mother shall regret her girl's reading this Arabian Nights".) It is a much bowdlerized version of the original edition and was not a commercial success. It excises 215 of the original 3,215 pages, including Burton's defense of ''[[turpiquilum]]'' in his "Foreword", all sexually explicit commentary, and the two final essays on "Pornography" and "Pederasty."&lt;ref&gt;Colligan, Collette (2002), [https://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/english/currentstudents/undergraduate/modules/fulllist/special/endsandbeginnings/28.2.colligan.pdf  “Esoteric Pornography”: Sir Richard Burton’s Arabian Nights and the Origins of Pornography”]; ''[[Victorian Review]]'', Vol. 28, No. 2, pp 31-64. Published by [[Victorian Studies Association of Western Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Burton merely lent her name to this expurgated edition. As she stated before his death, "I have never read, nor do I intend to read, at his own request, and to be true to my promise to him, my husband's 'Arabian Nights' ".

===Nichols/Smithers reprints===
*1894 [[H.S. Nichols &amp; Co]], London, edition by [[Leonard C. Smithers]], 12 Volumes; this reprint "omits given passages in dreadful taste, whose elimination will be mourned by no one".
*1897 H.S. Nichols &amp; Co, London, "Illustrated Library Edition", 12 Volumes (142 original illustrations, including a portrait of Burton, reproduced from the original pictures in oils specially painted by [[Albert Letchford]] with one set of the original 71 illustrations presented as included by the publisher and another set individually hand-coloured.)

:Nichols' second printing is a scarce and handsome edition, the first to include the illustrations by Letchford. In 1896, two years after their first edition of Burton's ''Nights'', the Nichols-Smithers duo commissioned Burton's close friend, Albert Letchford, to paint 65 illustrations for another edition as well as a portrait of Burton, and soon after commissioned for five more. Burton and Letchford had met several years before when the latter was 18 and in [[Florence]] beginning his art education. They discussed the possibility of illustrating the ''Nights''. Burton's suggestion of illustrating the ''Nights'' had appealed greatly to Letchford on account of the unlimited scope such a subject would give to an artist who loved the East and had a boundless imagination. Letchford commenced study of Eastern images for his paintings, though only one of the illustrations was painted in Burton's lifetime.

===American editions===
'''“Burton Society” edition:'''
*''Alf Laylah Wa Laylah, The Book of the Thousand Nights and a Night'', by Richard F. Burton; Press of the Carson-Harper Company, Denver, Colo., 1900–01. “For private subscribers only.” Includes 100 illustrations by [[Stanley L. Wood]]. (This was the first reprint of the original unexpurgated edition and the best reprint for many decades. This edition is the one used by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] for naming features on [[Enceladus (moon)|Enceladus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/References “Sources of Planetary Names”] @ the IAU website; the webpage has "Larsen" for "Carson", but this is an error.&lt;/ref&gt; Only the last three volumes (4, 5, and 6 of the ''Supplemental Nights'') are dated 1901. The edition was a commercial failure.)

'''“Burton Club” editions:'''
:The [[Electrotyping|electro]]s from the "Burton Society" edition were acquired by the "Burton Club" — “the ''nom de plume'' of a certain Boston publisher”, according to N.C. Penzer.&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 126.&lt;/ref&gt; This very successful series of editions probably began in 1903 (none of the volumes bear dates) and continued for many decades. There are 114 illustrations by various (at least 13) English and French artists. Many of these are uncredited and many are from other (some pre-Burton) editions of the ''Nights'', some even having nothing to do with the ''Nights'' or even the Middle East. (All of Letchford's works from the Nichols/Smithers edition are there, except the portrait of Burton.).&lt;ref&gt;Penzer, ''Op. cit.'', pg 127–130.&lt;/ref&gt; Penzer's bibliography lists nine different Burton Club editions; after about 1905 each was named after a city (Benares, Mecca, Medinah, Aden, Baghdad, Samara, Bassorah, Shammar, and Luristan), a new one appearing about every two years. Penzer called these the "Catch Word" editions and there are known to be at least 6 others (Teheran, Baroda, etc). These editions were made semi-surreptitiously up through the 1920s and many may have been printed in the US, but bound in the UK. There exists no definitive list of all "Burton Club" editions or their sequence. According to Penzer, the "Illustrated Benares" edition was the first.

'''''The Last Day of Pompeii''''' is a large history painting by [[Karl Bryullov]] produced in 1830–1833 on the subject of the [[Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79|eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79]]. It is notable for its positioning between [[Neoclassicism]], the predominant style in Russia at the time, and [[Romanticism]] as increasingly practised in France. The painting was received to near universal acclaim and made Bryullov the first Russian painter to have an international reputation. In Russia it was seen as proving that Russian art was as good as art practised in the rest of Europe. Critics in France and Russia both noted, however, that the perfection of the classically modelled bodies seemed to be out of keeping with their desperate plight and the overall theme of the painting, which was a Romantic one of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]] power of nature to destroy man's creations.

==Background==

The Roman city of [[Pompeii]], south of [[Naples]], was under active excavation in the early 19th century, work having begun on the city and its neighbour [[Herculaneum]] in the middle of the previous century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/pompeii/9852299/Pompeii-exhibition-a-timeline-of-Pompeii-and-Herculaneum.html Pompeii exhibition: a timeline of Pompeii and Herculaneum.] [[Andrew Wallace-Hadrill]] &amp; Joanne Berry, ''The Telegraph'', 3 March 2013.

[[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] had painted ''[[The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum]]'' in 1822 and others had sketched and produced engravings of the site.&lt;ref name=pomp/&gt;

In 1823, Bryullov arrived in Rome with his brother [[Aleksandr Bryullov|Aleksandr]] via Venice and Florence.&lt;ref name=leon&gt;Leontyeva, Galina.

He certainly visited Pompeii in 1827 and according to [[Rosalind Blakesley]], was so affected by the remains of the Via dei Sepolcri (Street of the Tombs) that he decided to set his painting in that street. Contemporary letters indicate that he studied [[Pliny the Younger]]'s eye-witness description of the disaster, in which Pliny's uncle died, and Pliny's observations in his letters to [[Tacitus]] were referenced in the picture.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;&lt;ref name=gard/&gt; Also in literature, Bryullov read [[Alessandro Manzoni]]'s novel ''[[I Promessi Sposi]]'' (''The Betrothed'') (1827) with its historically based account of a disastrous plague and the reactions to it of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Leontyeva, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

The subject is the eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in AD 79 that enveloped the city of Pompeii in volcanic ash killing most of its inhabitants. As a scene from the ancient world it was an appropriate subject for a [[history painting]], then regarded as the highest genre of painting, and the magnitude of the event also made it suitable for a large canvas that would allow Bryullov to showcase all his skills.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;

Bryullov said that he could only have completed the work with the example of [[Raphael]]'s large and complex work ''[[The School of Athens]]'' (1509–1511) as his model,&lt;ref&gt;Leontyeva, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; and he used [[classicism|classical]] forms recognisable as those used by the Renaissance masters, but combined them with features found in Romantic painting, such as dramatic colouring, the use of [[chiaroscuro]], and a high emotional content. Other works thought to have influenced Bryullov are Raphael's ''[[The Fire in the Borgo]]'' (1514–17) and [[Nicolas Poussin]]'s ''{{ill|The Plague at Ashdod|it|Peste di Azoth}}'' (1630).&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;&lt;ref name=gard/&gt;

He eschewed the coolness and flatness of the then-prevalent [[Neoclassicism]] in favour of excitement and vibrant colour, combined with a deep recession as a horse bolts into the depths of the painting, unseating its master. [[Nikolai Gogol]] commented: "His colouring is possibly brighter than it has ever been; his paints burn and hit you in the eye", but he was not the only one to note that the perfection of the classical figures contrasted with the wretchedness of their predicament.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;

Bryullov filled the canvas with authentic detail from Pompeii that he had seen at the site and in the museum at Naples such as the artefacts carried by the figures and the authentic paving and kerb stones. Statues toppling from their pedestals bring additional drama and demonstrate the sublime power of nature over man, a common trope in [[Romantic painting]]. The figures provide small vignettes of individual experience that reference stories from classical mythology, renaissance painting or ancient literature such as Pliny the Younger's account given to Tacitus, but most of the characters preserve their dignity in the face of death indicating Bryullov's great debt to the principals of Classicism. Poses and figures are drawn from classical painting or from people the artist knew such as [[Yuliya Samoylova]] and her daughters. The soldier and boy rescuing an older man may derive from the story of [[Aeneas]]'s rescue of his father from the destruction of [[Troy]] in mythology. To the scene is added an image of the artist himself as a Pompeian artist with his equipment balanced on his head.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;&lt;ref name=gard/&gt;

==Reception==
[[File:Hau. Interiors of the New Hermitage. Room of Russian Painting.jpg|thumb|''The Last Day of Pompeii'' alongside ''{{ill|Moses and the Brazen Serpent|ru|Медный змий (картина Бруни)}}'' (1840) by [[Feodor Bruni]] at the [[New Hermitage]] in 1856 in a watercolour by [[Edward P. Hau]]]]
The painting took so long to finish that Demidov threatened to cancel its commission, but when it was first shown at Bryullov's studio in Italy on Via San Claudio in Rome, it received a rapturous response. [[Sir Walter Scott]] is said to have studied the painting for an hour before declaring that it was not an ordinary painting, but an [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Vincenzo Camuccini]] described it as a "flaming colossus". The Italian archaeologist [[Pietro Ercole Visconti]] wrote an article praising the painter and the painting. The [[Uffizi, Florence|Uffizi]] requested a self-portrait of the artist. In Milan, Bryullov was given a standing ovation in a theatre and carried through the city's streets wearing a garland of flowers. It was seen there by [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]] whose novel ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' was published in 1834. In Bologna, gallery officials removed Raphael's ''[[The Ecstasy of St. Cecilia (Raphael)|St Cecilia]]'' from the walls and placed it in a private room when Bryullov asked to copy it.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;&lt;ref name=gard/&gt;

The reception was slightly cooler when it was displayed at the [[Paris Salon]] of 1834. It still won a gold medal, but some critics saw it as slightly outdated compared to [[Eugène Delacroix]]'s ''[[Femmes d'Alger dans leur Appartement]]'' (1834), which was exhibited alongside it, the high emotional content leading one critic to comment in ''[[L'Artiste]]'', "l'impression est moins voisine de la terreur que du ridicule" (the impression is less akin to terror than ridicule).&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Salon de 1834. Peinture", ''L'Artiste'', Vol. 7, No. 12 (1834), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; Rosalind Blakesley attributes this slightly behind-the-times feel to the isolation of contemporary Russian art teaching from the latest French developments since the start of the nineteenth century and the tensions inherent in the work between neo-classicism and romanticism.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;

It was the first Russian artwork to cause such an interest abroad, making Bryullov the first Russian painter to gain an international reputation.&lt;ref name=ham/&gt; Five foreign academies made him an honorary member and the quantity of positive reviews and critical comment was such that the Society for the Encouragement of Artists published a volume of them in Russian translation.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;

When the painting arrived in Russia in August 1834, it was received with as much enthusiasm as it had been in Italy, according to Gogol as much by those with a refined taste as those who were ignorant of art.&lt;ref&gt;Leontyeva, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Bryullov was made an honorary free associate of the academy and awarded the [[Order of St Anne of Russia|Order of St Anne]], third class. He was made a professor at the academy in Saint Petersburg and placed in charge of history painting. He met the Tsar. [[Ivan Turgenev]] described the painting as "the glory of Russia and Italy" and it inspired [[Alexander Pushkin]] to write a poem about the destruction of Pompeii.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt; Russians saw the painting as elevating the status of Russian art in Europe generally and in turn it elevated the status of painters in Russia. Gogol opined that it was a "bright resurrection of painting, which has been for too long in some sort of semi-lethargic state",&lt;ref name=blake/&gt; but was not alone in seeing a parallel between Pompeii and contemporary [[Saint Petersburg]] and the painting as a forecast of divine retribution for the modern city's decadent Western ways.&lt;ref&gt;"Tales of St Petersburg" by Orlando Figes in Frank Althaus and Mark Sutcliffe (2003) ''Petersburg Perspectives''. St Petersburg: Fontanka with Booth-Clibborn Editions. pp. 91-105 (p. 97).&lt;/ref&gt; The dissident [[Alexander Herzen]], meanwhile, saw it as an allegory about the collapse of European monarchies&lt;ref name=gard/&gt; or the tyrannical power of the Russian state over the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Leontyeva, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his great success with ''The Last Day of Pompeii'', Bryullov was expected to produce similar large works of history, but most of his attempts remained unfinished and he was criticised for his ''{{ill|Death of Ines de Castro|pt|O Assassínio de Inês de Castro (Briullov)}}'', which was completed in only 17 days in 1834.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rmgallery.ru/en/4944 ''The Death of Inês de Castro, Morganatic Wife of Don Pedro, Infant of Portugal''. 1834.] Russian Museum. Retrieved 26 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead he found success in portraits of the Russian elite including the royal family.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~russ15/russia_PI/Painting_romanticism.html Russian Painting During The Age of Romanticism.] Dartmouth College. Retrieved 26 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
In 1834, Demidov presented the painting, for which he had paid 25,000 [[ruble]]s, to [[Tsar Nicholas I|Tsar Nicholas]] in an attempt to win his favour. It was at first exhibited in the [[Winter Palace]], but in 1836 Nicholas donated it to the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]] where it remained until it was installed as the centre of the Russian painting display at the [[New Hermitage]] in 1851.&lt;ref name=blake/&gt; It is currently part of the collection of the [[State Russian Museum]] in Saint Petersburg.

'''The Short North''' is a neighborhood in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Ohio]], United States, centered on the main strip of High Street immediately north of downtown and extending until just south of the [[Ohio State University]] [[campus]] area.  It is an easy walk from the convention center or [[Nationwide Arena]] district to the south. The Short North is often crowded on weekends, particularly during the monthly "Gallery Hop" and other local and downtown events.

The Short North has been described as "colorful", "offbeat", and "trendy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Shawnie|title=Insiders' Guide to Columbus, Ohio, 2nd|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I6S6f16eE1sC&amp;pg=PA264|year=2008|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=978-0-7627-4784-9|page=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Biddle|first1=Julie King|last2=(MLS.)|first2=Barbara White|title=The Power of We: The Ohio Study Group Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cE_0d6x1jUsC&amp;pg=PA85|year=2010|publisher=IAP|isbn=978-1-61735-029-0|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district is heavily populated with [[art gallery|art galleries]], specialty shops, [[pub]]s, [[nightclub]]s, and [[coffee house]]s.  Most of its tightly packed brick buildings date from at least the early 20th century, with traditional storefronts along High Street (often with brightly painted murals on their side walls), and old apartment buildings and [[rowhouse]]s and newer [[condominium]] developments in the surrounding blocks.  The city installed 17 lighted metal archways extending across High Street throughout the Short North, reminiscent of such arches present in the area in the early 1900s.

The area is also known to be a very [[gay]]- and [[lesbian]]-friendly neighborhood which contains numerous gay nightclubs and bars and hosts the annual Columbus gay [[Columbus Pride|pride parade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parade|url=https://columbuspride.org/parade/|website=Stonewall Columbus|publisher=Stonewall Columbus|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The name "Short North" traces its roots back to the vernacular used by police for the area during a period of decline, namely as the neighborhood that—from a suburban commuter's perspective—had fallen 'just short' of the central business district's north end—both physically and economically. A reputation for diversity and an artistic,&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[http://travel.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/travel/14headsup.html "Hello, Columbus"], Ingrid Williams. New York Times. 14 mar 2010. Retrieved 6 sept 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] atmosphere has marked the Short North, with land prices and local rents rising steadily from the humble beginnings as a squatter’s neighborhood in the 1980s.  Prior to this gentrification of the neighborhood which originated from artists,&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; it had suffered prolonged decay and from latent, street-level crime and gang violence as Columbus affluent residents followed the economic bubble outward—into the [[suburb]]s—during the 1960s and 1970s.

The 1980s saw the neighborhood's rebirth enter into full gear as galleries began to open up and started to flourish. As Maria Gallowy owner of [[pm gallery]] the oldest gallery in the Short North once put it "It was one of those neighborhoods that artists love to move into because the possibilities are there."&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; In 1984 two Short North area galleries —the now defunct Art Reach and the still thriving pm gallery— began opening new exhibits on the first Saturday of every month to help cross-promote their businesses and build a more unified community.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; This loose coordination later evolved into the [[Gallery Hop]] which is still held every first Saturday of the month. The Gallery Hop today features most businesses keeping their doors open late into the night, jam-packed streets, and sidewalks populated with street musicians and other performers.

Since 1983, the Short North has also hosted the annual [[Doo Dah Parade]], a parody of typical [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] parades that includes politically slanted paraders and floats as well as absurdities such as the "Marching Fidels," a band of [[Fidel Castro]] lookalikes.  The parade starts in neighboring [[Victorian Village]], at [[Goodale Park]], and winds north to finish coming south down High Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Doo Dah Parade|url=http://www.doodahparade.com/|website=The Doo Dah Parade|publisher=The Friends of Doo Dah|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Short North also hosts HighBall Halloween, Masquerade on High, a fashion show and street parade that closes down High Street. In 2011, in its 4th year, HighBall Halloween gained notoriety as it accepted its first Expy award. HighBall Halloween has much to offer for those interested in fashion and the performing and visual arts or for those who want to celebrate Halloween and with food and drinks from all around the city. Each year the event is put on with a different theme and it increases in size and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HighBall - You Are What You Wear|url=http://highballcolumbus.org/|website=HighBall Columbus|accessdate=15 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7241">{{About||the 2013 film|Trap Street (film)}}

In [[cartography]], a '''trap street''' is a [[fictitious entry]] in the form of a misrepresented [[street]] on a [[map]], often outside the area the map nominally covers, for the purpose of "trapping" potential [[copyright]] violators of the map who, if caught, would be unable to explain the inclusion of the "trap street" on their map as innocent. On maps that are not of streets, other "copyright trap" features (such as [[Phantom_settlement|nonexistent towns]], or mountains with the wrong elevations) may be inserted or altered for the same purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Adams. [http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1058/do-maps-have-copyright-traps-to-permit-detection-of-unauthorized-copies ''Do maps have 'copyright traps' to permit detection of unauthorized copies?''] ''The Straight Dope'', August 16, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trap streets are often nonexistent streets; but sometimes, rather than actually depicting a street where none exists, a map will misrepresent the nature of a street in a fashion that can still be used to detect copyright violators but is less likely to interfere with navigation. For instance, a map might add nonexistent bends to a street, or depict a major street as a narrow lane, without changing its location or its connections to other streets.

Trap streets are rarely acknowledged by publishers. One known case is a popular driver's atlas for the city of [[Athens]], [[Greece]], which has a warning inside its front cover that potential copyright violators should beware of trap streets.&lt;ref&gt;"{{lang|el|Αττική}}" Greek-language map book published by Nik. &amp; Ioan Fotis O.E. {{clarify|date=August 2014}} (Νικ. &amp; Ιωάν. Φωτής Ο.Ε. {{clarify|date=August 2014}}, http://www.fotismaps.gr {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107170139/http://www.fotismaps.gr/ |date=2012-11-07 }}), Greek-language warning inside front cover&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

In an edition of the [[BBC Two]] programme ''[[Map Man]]'', first broadcast 17 October 2005, a spokesperson for the [[Geographers' A-Z Map Company]] claimed there are "about 100" trap streets included in the [[London A-Z]] Street atlas. One such street, "Bartlett Place", a genuine but misnamed walkway (named after Kieran Bartlett, an employee at Geographers’ A-Z Map Company), was identified in the programme and will appear in future editions under its real name, Broadway Walk.

It has been suggested that [[Google Earth]] placed [[Sandy Island, New Caledonia]] as the geographical analog to a trap street, although historical evidence implies that it originated as a cartographical error and [[Google]] simply passed the error along.

== Legal issues ==
Trap streets are not copyrightable under the federal law of the [[United States]].  In ''Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.'',&lt;ref&gt;796 F.Supp. 729, [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York|E.D.N.Y.]], 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=leagle.com|url=http://www.leagle.com/decision/19921525796FSupp729_11403/NESTER'S%20MAP%20&amp;%20GUIDE%20CORP.%20v.%20HAGSTROM%20MAP%20CO|date=|accessdate=2015-11-14|title=Nester's Map &amp; Guide Corp. v. Hagstrom Map Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[United States]] federal court found that copyright traps are not themselves protectable by [[copyright]]. There, the court stated: "[t]o treat 'false' facts interspersed among actual facts and represented as actual facts as fiction would mean that no one could ever reproduce or copy actual facts without risk of reproducing a false fact and thereby violating a copyright&amp;nbsp;... If such were the law, information could never be reproduced or widely disseminated."  (Id. at 733)

In a 2001 case, [[The Automobile Association]] in the [[United Kingdom]] agreed to settle a case for £20,000,000 when it was caught copying [[Ordnance Survey]] maps. In this case, the identifying "fingerprints" were not deliberate errors but rather stylistic features such as the width of roads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/mar/06/andrewclark| title=Copying maps costs AA £20m| last=Clark| first=Andrew| date=2001-03-06| work=[[The Guardian]] | accessdate=2007-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another case, the [[Singapore Land Authority]] sued [[Streetdirectory.com|Virtual Map]], an online publisher of maps, for infringing on its copyright. The Singapore Land Authority stated in its case that there were deliberate errors in maps they had provided to Virtual Map years earlier. Virtual Map denied this and insisted that it had done its own [[cartography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hin|first1=Peh Aik|title=Virtual Map (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Singapore Land Authority and another application[2009] 2 SLR(R) 558; [2009] SGCA 2|url=http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/cases-in-articles/intellectual-property/1571-virtual-map-singapore-pte-ltd-v-singapore-land-authority-and-another-application-2009-2-slr-r-558-2009-sgca-2|website=www.singaporelaw.sg|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924102018/http://www.singaporelaw.sg/sglaw/laws-of-singapore/case-law/cases-in-articles/intellectual-property/1571-virtual-map-singapore-pte-ltd-v-singapore-land-authority-and-another-application-2009-2-slr-r-558-2009-sgca-2|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The 2010 novel ''[[Kraken (novel)|Kraken]]'' by [[China Miéville]] features the trap streets of the ''[[Geographers' A–Z Street Atlas|London A-Z]]'' being places where the magical denizens of the city can exist without risk of being disturbed by normal folk.

A 2013 film, ''[[Trap Street (film)|Trap Street]]'', inverts the usual meaning of a ''trap street'', becoming a real street which is deliberately obscured or removed from a map—and anyone who attempts to identify it by placing it on public record is then "trapped".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/reviews/trap-street-review-venice-toronto-1200601404|publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|title=Venice Film Review: ‘Trap Street’|author=Chang, Justin|accessdate=2014-05-11|date=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 ''[[Doctor Who]]'' episode "[[Face the Raven]]" features a hidden street where alien asylum seekers have taken shelter. Due to a psychic field that subconsciously makes observers ignore it, outsiders consider it a trap street when they see it on maps. One scene involves the character [[Clara Oswald]] discussing the definition of "trap street". The episode's working title was also "Trap Street".

==History==
Vitech Corporation was established in 1992 in [[Vienna, Virginia]] by David Long, then an undergrad student at [[Virginia Tech]]. Long, who at the time was majoring in engineering science and mechanics and studying under [[Benjamin Blanchard]] and [[Wolter Fabrycky]], developed a software program to meet the requirements for a senior project. He began the project as a tool for academic use, then refined it to make CORE, a modeling environment for systems engineering problems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=24173477|title=Company Overview of Vitech Corporation|website=bloomburg.com|language=|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while earning his master’s degree in Systems Engineering at Virginia Tech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ise.vt.edu/people/advisory-board/long.html|title=Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering - Virginia Tech|website=ise.vt.edu|language=|accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long initially sought to license the program through an existing company, but eventually opted to manage and market the product himself, establishing Vitech Corporation in the process.

CORE has gone on to become a tool used in the teaching of model-based systems engineering, and is cited in engineering textbooks such as ''Systems Engineering: Design Principles and Models'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dahai|first=Liu|date=2016 |title=Systems Engineering Design Principles and Models|publisher=CRC Press |page=59,104–108,127–133,138–139 |isbn=9781466506831}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Dahai Liu, ''The Engineering Design of Systems Models and Methods'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;62–66),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buede |first1=Dennis |last2=Miller |first2=William |date=2016 |title=The Engineering Design of Systems Models and Methods, third edition |location=Hoboken |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=62–66 |isbn=9781119028062}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Dennis M.

[[File:1942LaVentana.jpg|thumb|A 1942 copy of the yearbook ''[[La Ventana (yearbook)|La Ventana]]'' from Texas Technological College (now [[Texas Tech University]])]]

A '''yearbook''', also known as an '''annual''', is a type of [[Annual publication|a book published annually]] to record, highlight, and commemorate the past year of a [[school]]. The term also refers to a book of statistics or facts published annually. A yearbook often has an overarching theme that is present throughout the entire book.

Many [[secondary education|high schools]], [[college]]s, and [[Primary school|elementary]] and [[middle school]]s publish yearbooks; however, many schools are dropping yearbooks or decreasing page counts given social media alternatives to a mass-produced physical photographically-oriented record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dern|first1=Daniel|title=In the Facebook era, will printed yearbooks survive?|url=http://www.betaboston.com/news/2014/05/23/in-the-facebook-era-will-printed-yearbooks-survive/|website=betaBoston|publisher=The Boston Globe|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 to 2013, the number of U.S. college yearbooks dropped from roughly 2,400 to 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Susan|title=The Future of the Venerable Yearbook|url=http://cmreview.org/the-future-of-the-venerable-yearbook/|website=cmreview.org|publisher=College Media Review|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{TOC right|limit=2}}

==Yearbooks by country==
===United States===
[[Elementary school|Elementary]] and [[middle school]]s may have a designated staff member who is in charge of putting together that school's yearbook, with or without the help of the students. These books are usually considerably smaller than a [[secondary education|high school]] or college yearbook.

High school yearbooks generally cover a wide variety of topics from academics, student life, sports, clubs and other major school events. Generally, each student is pictured with their class, while seniors might get a page-width picture or a slightly larger photo than the underclassmen to reflect their status in the school. Each school organization, such as a sports team or academic/social club, is usually pictured. A high school yearbook staff consists of students with one or more faculty advisors. The yearbook staff can be chosen in a variety of ways, including volunteer extracurricular organization, academic class, or  assigned to the entire senior class.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

High school yearbooks are considered a form of journalism by scholastic journalism such as the [[Columbia Scholastic Press Association]], the [[National Scholastic Press Association]], the [[Journalism Education Association]] and state and regional scholastic press associations.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Numerous awards are given for journalistic excellence annually.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

Colleges that publish yearbooks follow a similar format to [[secondary education|high schools]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} Some include detailed recaps of [[American football|football]] and [[basketball]] games. College yearbooks are considered by the [[Associated Collegiate Press]] (ACP) to be a form of journalism. ACP holds the annual Pacemaker competition for college yearbooks as well as other collegiate media outlets.

===Australia===
Yearbooks published by Australian schools follow a consistent structure to their North American counterparts. Australian yearbooks function as an annual magazine for the school body, with a significant focus on objectively reporting the events that occurred during the schooling year. They cover various topics including academic, sporting, extra-curricular, student life and other activities. Yearbook staff predominantly consist of only one or two school teachers who serve as editors in chief. Australian school yearbooks are predominantly created on [[A4 paper size]], featuring a softcover style front-and-back cover, typically 250 or 300 g/m² density. Hardcover style yearbooks are not as common, although exceptions occur.

In recent years, companies have been servicing Australian schools with online yearbook systems that allow schools to create their yearbooks collaboratively online.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} This is sold as allowing a higher level of student involvement whilst making the workflow simpler and easier for all involved. Additionally, some schools feature a separate yearbook for students in [[Year 12]].

==== Publishing ====
Australian school yearbooks are primarily published with [[offset printing]] technology, with a mix of colour, spot colour, and black and white pages, depending on the school's budget. In the past, Year 12 yearbooks were simply printed using a [[photocopier]], but Australian yearbook publishers have improved the quality of these publications by providing low cost [[digital printing]] solutions.

=== India ===
India does not have a long history of publishing school yearbooks. However, top Business schools and Engineering colleges publish custom yearbooks. This is typically created by the final year students of the batch. A yearbook or a memory book would consist of testimonials and common pages such as Directors address and events, festivals picture collages.

Most top schools do create schools magazines which are shared with each student. Some of the early adopters among school students are starting to create custom yearbooks in the same line as created by students from US or Europe. This trend is likely to pick up with the advent of technology platforms that make it easy for students to create them.

===South Africa===
In South Africa it is not as common to find yearbooks in schools as it is in countries such as the US and Canada, though there are a number of schools that allocate annual funding and publish yearbooks at the end of the school year (November or December). These yearbooks closely resemble those found in the US, with columns about certain themes, in-depth coverage of major events and large collections of photos, as well as drawings reflecting daily life at these schools.

Major events covered include Matric Farewell Dances (equivalent to Senior Prom in the US), annual sporting events (such as Inter-schools where a number of schools assemble and compete in various sports as well as with dance routines in competition for spirit awards etc.), and grade group events organized specifically for a specific grade.

===Nigeria===
In Nigeria, it is very  common to find yearbooks in schools as it is in countries such as the US and Canada, though there are a number of schools that allocate annual funding and publish yearbooks at the end of the school year (July or August). These yearbooks closely resemble those found in the US, with columns about certain themes, in-depth coverage of major events and large collections of photos, as well as drawings reflecting daily life at these schools. Some schools do produce yearbook every year.

==U.S. military==
[[File:Hamilton-yearbook-1968.jpg|thumb|200px|1968 military yearbook]]

Warships of the [[United States Navy]] often produce a yearbook style publication upon completion of a long deployment (typically six months or more). These books, referred to by sailors as "[[cruise book]]s" are produced on board by the ship's Morale, Welfare and Recreation department and Public Affairs staff, and then printed ashore by the same printing companies that publish high school and college yearbooks. The cruise book of a [[Nimitz class|''Nimitz''-class]] [[aircraft carrier]] typically reaches over 600 pages in length, as it includes portraits of the more than 5,000 sailors and Marines assigned to the ship's company and embarked carrier air wing.

The Navy's [[Naval Station Great Lakes|Recruit Training Center]] in [[Great Lakes]], [[Illinois]] also produces yearbook style publications for each graduating division of recruits. These publications are much smaller, as each recruit division totals roughly 80 sailors. The book is called "The Keel" after the part of a ship that is constructed first, as RTC or boot camp sets the foundation for the sailor's career. These books contain a color section common to all books published that year, with a specific black and white section added for each recruit division and their "brother" or "sister" division.

==Production and distribution==

===Compilation===
Yearbooks are generally compiled by a student club or a yearbook class, usually advised by a faculty member. The yearbook staff usually has one or more editors who are responsible for collecting and compiling all of the information to be contained within the book, also deciding the layout and allocation of space for each contributor.

====Sections====
Most yearbooks have a similar format, which includes individual photographs of students, information on activities, sports and other activities.

=====People (seniors, underclassmen, faculty)=====
In the U.S., where a yearbook often covers the whole school and not just the senior class, these sections are usually arranged in chronological order by class (freshmen, sophomore, junior, and senior), in either ascending or descending order. Normally students will have individual portraits  accompanied by their names. Senior photographs are usually larger than those of underclassmen and are sometimes accompanied by text about their accomplishments throughout high school and their future plans. Frequently, seniors are polled to nominate their classmates for "superlatives" or "class celebrities" (such as "most likely to succeed", "most athletic", "most spirited", "best smile", and "class clown"), are often published in the senior section. Some private schools and smaller high schools set aside an entire page for each senior. These pages are sometimes designed by the seniors themselves, with each senior submitting a digital or physical version of the page he or she would like featured in the book.

"Picture Day" is the school day in the United States and Canada when [[student]]s have their photographs taken by a professional [[photographer]]. Parents can purchase packages of these [[Portrait photography|portrait]]s to distribute, often accompanied by other items featuring the portrait. These portraits often go into the school yearbook, which are usually distributed at the end of the school year. The pictures may also be used on student ID cards. There will also generally be a second day ("retake day") to take pictures if the student is absent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://schoolportraits.lifetouch.com/portraitday/commonquestions/index.aspx#Q9 |title=Lifetouch - Photography for a Lifetime |publisher=Schoolportraits.lifetouch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK and other countries, where yearbooks often only cover the final year group and not the entire school, each student may have more space for answers to various questions as well as their photo (or photos). In Year 11 (England &amp; Wales) members are usually grouped by form/class; whilst Year 13 tend not to be grouped in such a way, but instead just appear alphabetically throughout the book. Its common in these markets for each person to have between a quarter and a whole page each, depending on the budget available for the yearbook (as more pages means a higher cost). The editorial team chooses questions for members to answer (such as "Favourite teacher?" or "Where will you be in 5 years time?") and these answers appear alongside member photos. These photos and answers are sometimes also collected online.

=====Student life=====
Several pages are often used for pages chronicling activities undertaken by students, such as trips abroad, activity trips, sporting and other special events. This part of the book often covers students' lives both inside and outside of the campus.

Sometimes members of a yearbook write editorial and journalistic content about life as a student, current events (local, national, and international), and other matters of interest to the peer group.

=====Academics/education=====
This section covers the classes, projects and more educational aspects of the school year.

=====Organizations=====
This section describes student organizations (sometimes referred to as [[High school club|clubs]]) and what they did during the year. These descriptions are often accompanied by a photo or photos of the organizations' members. This section sometimes includes a list of the members of each organization.

=====Sports=====
Often listed by season or club, these pages chronicle the accomplishments of the school's teams. Along with a short article listing the season's highlights, these pages include team photographs and action pictures.

=====Advertising pages=====
Many yearbooks gain revenue by including a section of ads from local businesses.

Some schools sell advertisements for seniors. Parents, other family members, and friends use these ads to congratulate a senior — or group of seniors — for their accomplishments.

=====Index=====
Bigger yearbooks tend to include an alphabetical listing of everyone included in the yearbook, along with a listing of the pages they may be found on.

=====Colophon=====
Usually near the end of the book, the [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] lists staff members and acknowledgements. The colophon includes technical information pertaining to the yearbook such as publisher, total number of pages, paper weight and copyright.

=====Signature or autograph page=====
Some yearbooks contain a few pages which will be left blank for people to write messages about the preceding year and summer.  This tradition was inherited from [[commonplace book]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Billock |first1=Jennifer |title=Why Do People Sign Yearbooks? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/06/why-do-people-sign-yearbooks/561851 |accessdate=4 June 2018 |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Design ===

Students may design yearbook pages themselves or use company-provided templates in most cases.

In general, most yearbook pages are designed as double-page spreads and include several items:
* '''Headline''': An abbreviated sentence highlighting the content of the spread, usually involving word play along with factual information
* '''Story/Copy''': Staffs usually write short stories capturing the highlights of a specific department, sports season, organization, etc., from the past year. Often, yearbook staff members will either interview students, teachers and others for comments. Alternative story formats have gained popularity in recent times, allowing stories to be told in visual ways (graphs, charts, polls, timelines, etc.).
* '''Photographs''': Every spread that isn't a portrait or an ad spread contains candid shots of students, suitable to the page's topic and theme. Included with the photographs are one or more captions, which describe each picture; these often begin with a [[lead-in]].

In the past, most yearbooks were laid out by hand, with photographs physically cropped and placed on layout boards. The work was tedious, and required multiple deadlines and contact with a yearbook publisher. Today, virtually all yearbooks are published using computers, which allows for shorter deadlines and easier editing. Students typically design pages using a [[desktop publishing]] program, usually [[Adobe InDesign]]. Some schools use a proprietary web-based design program belonging to the company that prints the book.

===Publication===

==== U.S. printing companies ====
Yearbook printing companies usually have representatives who work with the adviser and staff at each school to assist in the creation of the yearbook.

Yearbook companies that use off-set printing require that groups of pages be sent periodically, rather than all at once, to the plant. This is done to stagger the work required to complete yearbooks for all the schools they cover. After the editors review each page and make changes, the pages are sent to the yearbook plant, usually via the [[Internet]]. Yearbook companies that use digital printing methods may only require one submission since the entire book is printed at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See the Difference|url=http://yearbooks.picaboo.com/comparison/|website=Picaboo Yearbooks|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the proofing process is not performed on-line, the adviser and editors receive proofs (typically full size prints) about a week or so after the submission of pages. This gives the school a final opportunity to make adjustments or changes. After all the proofs have been returned to the printing company the requested corrections are made, the books are printed, bound, and then sent to the school for distribution.

A number of educational institutions and yearbook printing companies operate camps and summer sessions at which student yearbook personnel can learn or polish the skills they need in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~journshp/ourworkshops/yearbook.htm |title=University of Iowa Yearbook Workshop |accessdate=2007-09-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701161116/http://www.uiowa.edu/~journshp/ourworkshops/yearbook.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/precollege/highschoolnewsandyearbook.html |title=Oregon State University High School Yearbook Workshop |accessdate=2007-09-02 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070806043241/http://oregonstate.edu/precollege/highschoolnewsandyearbook.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mc.greenbush.org/?action=dispMeeting&amp;mID=7145 |title=Greenbush Yearbook Workshop |accessdate=2007-09-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distribution===
Often, yearbooks are distributed at the end of a school year to allow students, teachers, and other members of the school to obtain the books and signatures/personal messages from classmates. In the U.S., those that distribute at this time may publish a supplemental insert with photographs from spring sports and milestone events (such as [[prom]] and [[graduation]]) and other important events. Many schools at which yearbooks are distributed at or before the end of a school year have a tradition of having students sign and leave notes on each other's yearbooks.

Some schools distribute yearbooks after the end of the school year—such as in July, at [[homecoming]] (US) in October or another designated time in order to include year-end activities. In some cases, yearbooks are mailed to the parents' homes of graduated seniors.

=== India printing companies ===
Yearbook printing is gaining acceptance in developing countries such as India. Students want to preserve their sweet memories of their childhood and teen years. India is also seeing a high growth of students   proute moving to study in the International board. This trend will further provide impetus to the acceptance and growth of Yearbooks with students. Zaffingo and yearbookcanvas have been instrumental in introducing and promoting yearbooks with students in India.

==Digital yearbooks==
A digital yearbook or eYearbook is a yearbook holding memories of a given time with a given group of people—most commonly, a school year at a particular school—that exists in digital form.

A digital yearbook may contain text, images, audio, and video. While a traditional paper yearbook may contain 300+ pages, a digital yearbook can contain unlimited pages. The end product of a digital yearbook can be a CD-ROM, a DVD or is captured in an eBook format. The first CD-ROM yearbook was created by students at South Eugene High School in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Layton|first=Tom|title=The Electronic Eugenean: A Multimedia Yearbook Project|journal=Writing Notebook: Creative Word Processing in the Classroom|date=April–May 1991|volume=8|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A digital yearbook page, also known as a [[dyp (app)|dyp]], makes an existing yearbook interactive using Portrait Recognition Technology. A mobile application and smartphone or tablet is used to scan a student's portrait.  Scanning the portrait will take the student to the Digital Yearbook Page. DYPs contain multimedia content archived throughout the school year. The DYP can also contain links with contact information.
