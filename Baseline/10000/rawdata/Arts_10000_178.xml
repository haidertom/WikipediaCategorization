The year '''1617 in [[music]]''' involved some significant events.

== Events ==
*[[January 6]] – ''[[The Vision of Delight]]'', a masque  written by [[Ben Jonson]] and designed by [[Inigo Jones]], is performed at [[Whitehall Palace]], probably for the first time on this date, with a second performance of January 19. The work features music by [[Nicholas Lanier]].
*[[January 16]] – [[Thomas Weelkes]], organist at [[Chichester Cathedral]], is dismissed for being drunk and disorderly.
*[[February 22]] –  ''[[Lovers Made Men]]'', another masque by Jonson, Jones, and Lanier, is performed. (Lanier's music for the masque may have featured recitatives throughout; if so, it would have been a significant precursor of English opera, but this cannot be certain as the music has not survived.)
*[[August 30]] – [[Alessandro Grandi]] is appointed singer at San Marco, Venice, at a salary of 80 ducats per annum, under choirmaster [[Claudio Monteverdi]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerome Roche and Roark Miller, "Grandi, Alessandro (i)", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (musicologist)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fashion in the twenty years between 1775–1795''' in Western culture became simpler and less elaborate. These changes were a result of  emerging modern ideals of selfhood,&lt;ref&gt;Dror Wahrman, ''The Making of the Modern Self'' (Yale University Press, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; the declining fashionability of highly elaborate [[Rococo]] styles, and the widespread embrace of the rationalistic or "classical" ideals of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Roche|title=The Culture of Clothing: Dress and Fashion in the Ancien Régime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iksOtjX47xoC&amp;pg=PA150|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enlightenment concept of "fashion"==
It is also at this time when the concept of fashion, as it is known today, begins. Prior to this point, clothes as a means of self-expression were limited. Guild-controlled systems of production and distribution, and the [[sumptuary laws]] made clothing both hard to come by and expensive for the common people. However, by 1750 the consumer revolution brought about cheaper copies of fashionable styles, allowing members of all classes to partake in fashionable dress. Thus, fashion begins to represent an expression of individuality.&lt;ref&gt;Cissie Fairchilds, "Fashion and Freedom in the French Revolution", ''Continuity and Change'', vol. 15, no. 3 [2000], 419-433.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter McNeil "The Appearance of Enlightenment pg. 391-398&lt;/ref&gt; The constant change in dress mirrored political and social ideals of the time.

==French Revolution==
As the radicals and Jacobins became more powerful, there was a revulsion against high-fashion because of its extravagance and its association with royalty and aristocracy.  It was replaced with a sort of "anti-fashion" for men and women that emphasized simplicity and modesty.  The men wore plain, dark clothing and short unpowdered hair. During the Terror of 1794, the workaday outfits of the sans-culottes symbolized Jacobin egalitarianism.

High fashion and extravagance returned to France and its satellite states under the [[French Directory|Directory]], 1795–99, with its [[Directoire style|"directoire" styles]]; the men did not return to extravagant customs.&lt;ref&gt;James A. Leith, "Fashion and Anti-Fashion in the French Revolution," ''Consortium on Revolutionary Europe 1750-1850: Selected Papers'' (1998) pp 1&lt;/ref&gt; These trends would reach their height in the [[Neoclassicism|classically-styled]] [[1795-1820 in fashion|fashions of the late 1790s and early 19th century]].&lt;ref&gt;Aileen Ribeiro, ''The Art of Dress: Fashion in England and France 1750-1820'' (Yale University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; For men, coats, [[waistcoat]]s and [[stocking]]s of previous decades continued to be fashionable across the Western world, although they too changed silhouette in this period, becoming slimmer and using earthier colors and more matte fabrics.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Hollander, ''Sex and Suits: The Evolution of Modern Dress'' (Knopf, 1994).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women's fashion==

===Overview===
[[File:Polonaise.png|right|thumb|This gown shows the fitted back of the ''robe à l'anglaise'' and skirt draped ''à la polonaise''. [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]
[[File:Woman's redingote c. 1790.jpg|right|thumb|Woman's redingote c. 1790, [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]]]]

Women's clothing styles maintained an emphasis on the conical shape of the torso while the shape of the skirts changed throughout the period. The wide [[Pannier (clothing)|panniers]] (holding the skirts out at the side) for the most part disappeared by 1780 for all but the most formal [[Court (royal)|court]] functions, and false rumps (bum-pads or hip-pads) were worn for a time.

[[Marie Antoinette]] had a marked influence on French fashion beginning in the 1780s. Around this time, she had begun to rebel against the structure of court life. She abolished her morning toilette and often escaped to the [[Petit Trianon]] with increasing frequency, leading to criticism of her exclusivity by cutting off the traditional right of the aristocracy to their monarch. Marie Antoinette found refuge from the stresses of the rigidity of court life and the scrutiny of the public eye, the ailing health of her children, and her sense of powerlessness in her marriage by carrying out a pseudo-country life in her newly constructed [[hameau de la reine|hameau]].&lt;ref name="Werlin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Werlin|first=Katy|title=The Chemise a la Reine|url=http://thefashionhistorian.blogspot.com/2012/03/chemise-la-reine.html|work=The Fashion Historian|accessdate=27 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She and an elite circle of friends would dress in peasant clothing and straw hats and retreat to the hameau. It was out of this practice that her style of dress evolved.

By tradition, a lady of the court was instantaneously recognizable by her panniers, corset and weighty silk materials that constructed her gown in the style of à la française or à l'anglaise. By doing away with these things, Marie Antoinette's gaulle or chemise á la Reine stripped female aristocrats of their traditional identity; noblewomen could now be confused with peasant girls, confusing long standing sartorial differences in class. The chemise was made from a white muslin and the queen was further accused of importing foreign fabrics and crippling the French silk industry.&lt;ref name="Weber 2006 156–175"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Caroline|title=Queen of Fashion: What Marie Antoinette Wore to the Revolution|year=2006|publisher=Henry Holt and Co.|isbn=0-8050-7949-1|pages=156–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gaulle consisted of thin layers of this muslin, loosely draped around the body and belted at the waist, and was often worn with an apron and a [[fichu]]. This trend was quickly adopted by fashionable women in France and England, but upon the debut of the portrait of Marie Antoinette by Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, the clothing style created a scandal and increased the hatred for the queen.&lt;ref name="Werlin"/&gt; The queen's clothing in the portrait looked like a chemise, nothing more than a garment that women wore under her other clothing or to lounge in the intimate space of the private boudoir. It was perceived to be indecent, and especially unbecoming for the queen. The sexual nature of the gaulle undermined the notions of status and the ideology that gave her and kept her in power. Marie Antoinette wanted to be private and individual, a notion unbecoming for a member of the monarchy that is supposed to act as a symbol of the state.

When Marie Antoinette turned thirty, she decided it was no longer decent for her to dress in this way and returned to more acceptable courtly styles, though she still dressed her children in the style of the gaulle, which may have continued to reflect badly on the opinion of their mother even though she was making visible efforts to rein in her own previous fashion excess.&lt;ref name="Weber 2006 156–175"/&gt; However, despite the distaste with the queen's inappropriate fashions, and her own switch back to traditional dress later in life, the gaulle became a popular garment in both France and abroad. Despite its controversial beginnings, the simplicity of the style and material became the custom and had a great influence on the transition into the neoclassical styles of the late 1790s.&lt;ref name="Werlin"/&gt;

During the years of the [[French Revolution]], women's dress expanded into different types of national costume. Women wore variations of white skirts, topped with revolutionary colored striped jackets, as well as white Greek chemise gowns, accessorized with shawls, scarves, and ribbons.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt;

By 1790, skirts were still somewhat full, but they were no longer obviously pushed out in any particular direction (though a slight bustle pad might still be worn). The "pouter-pigeon" front came into style (many layers of cloth pinned over the bodice), but in other respects women's fashions were starting to be simplified by influences from Englishwomen's country outdoors wear (thus the "[[redingote]]" was the French pronunciation of an English "riding coat"), and from [[neo-classicism]]. By 1795, waistlines were somewhat raised, preparing the way for the development of the [[empire silhouette]] and unabashed neo-classicism of late 1790s fashions.

===Gowns===

The usual fashion at the beginning of the period was a low-necked [[gown]] (usually called in French a ''robe''), worn over a petticoat.  Most gowns had skirts that opened in front to show the petticoat worn beneath. As part of the general simplification of dress, the open bodice with a separate [[stomacher]] was replaced by a bodice with edges that met center front.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waugh|first=Norah|title=The Cut of Women's Clothes: 1600-1930|year=1968|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-87830-026-0|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''robe à la française'' or [[sack-back gown]], with back pleats hanging loosely from the neckline, long worn as court fashion, made its last appearance early in this period. A fitted bodice held the front of the gown closely to the figure.

The ''robe à l'anglaise'' or [[close-bodied gown]] featured back pleats sewn in place to fit closely to the body, and then released into the skirt which would be draped in various ways.  Elaborate draping "[[Polonaise (clothing)|à la polonaise]]" became fashionable by the mid-1770s, featuring backs of the gowns' skirts pulled up into swags either through loops or through the pocket slits of the gown.

Front-wrapping thigh-length ''shortgowns'' or [[bedgown]]s of lightweight printed cotton fabric remained fashionable at-home morning wear, worn with petticoats. Over time, bedgowns became the staple upper garment of British and American female working-class street.  Women would also often wear a neck handkerchief, sometimes for modesty reasons. In surviving artwork, there are few women depicted wearing bedgowns without a handkerchief.   These large handkerchiefs could be of linen, plain, colored or of printed cotton for working wear.  Wealthy women wore handkerchiefs of fine, sheer fabrics, often trimmed with lace or embroidery with their expensive gowns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/European-Culture-18th-Century/Eighteenth-Century-Clothing.html|title=Eighteenth-Century Clothing|last=|first=|date=|website=Fashion Encyclopedia|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jackets and redingotes===

An informal alternative to the dress was a costume of a jacket and petticoat, based on working class fashion but executed in finer fabrics with a tighter fit.

The ''[[caraco]]'' was a [[jacket]]-like bodice worn with a petticoat, with elbow-length sleeves.  By the 1790s, caracos had full-length, tight sleeves.

As in previous periods, the traditional [[riding habit]] consisted of a tailored jacket like a man's coat, worn with a high-necked shirt, a waistcoat, a petticoat, and a hat. Alternatively, the jacket and a false waistcoat-front might be a made as a single garment, and later in the period a simpler riding jacket and petticoat (without waistcoat) could be worn.

Another alternative to the traditional habit was a coat-dress called a ''joseph'' or ''riding coat'' (borrowed in French as [[redingote]]), usually of unadorned or simply trimmed woolen fabric, with full-length, tight sleeves and a broad collar with lapels or revers. The redingote was later worn as an overcoat with the light-weight chemise dress.

===Underwear===
The shift, [[chemise]] (in France), or smock, had a low neckline and elbow-length sleeves which were full early in the period and became increasingly narrow as the century progressed.  [[Undergarments|Drawers]] were not worn in this period.

Strapless stays were cut high at the armpit, to encourage a woman to stand with her shoulders slightly back, a fashionable posture.  The fashionable shape was a rather conical torso, with large hips.  The waist was not particularly small.  Stays were usually laced snugly, but comfortably; only those interested in extreme fashions laced tightly.  They offered back support for heavy lifting, and poor and middle class women were able to work comfortably in them.  As the relaxed, country fashion took hold in France, stays were sometimes replaced by a lightly boned garment called "un corset," though this style did not achieve popularity in England, where stays remained standard through the end of the period.

[[Pannier (clothing)|Panniers]] or side-hoops remained an essential of court fashion but disappeared everywhere else in favor of a few petticoats. Free-hanging pockets were tied around the waist and were accessed through ''pocket slits'' in the side-seams of the gown or petticoat. Woolen or quilted waistcoats were worn over the stays or corset and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting, especially in the cold climates of [[Northern Europe]] and [[United States|America]].

===Footwear and accessories===
Shoes had high, curved heels (the origin of modern "louis heels") and were made of fabric or leather. [[Shoe buckle]]s remained fashionable until they were abandoned along with [[high-heeled footwear]] and other [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] fashions in the years after the [[French Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;Tortora and Eubank (1995), p. 272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O78521/shoe-buckles/|title=Victoria and Albert Museum: Shoe Buckles|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The long upper also was eliminated, essentially leaving only the toes of the foot covered. The slippers that were ordinarily worn with shoes were abandoned because the shoes had become comfortable enough to be worn without them. Fans continued to be popular in this time period, however, they were increasingly replaced, outdoors at least, by the parasol. Indoors the fan was still carried exclusively. Additionally, women began using walking sticks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kohler|first=Carl|title=A History of Costume|year=1963|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York, NY|pages=372–373}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hairstyles and headgear===
[[File:Marie Antoinette with decadent hair.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marie Antoinette]], Queen of France, was one of the most influential figures in fashion during the 1770s and 1780s, especially when it came to hairstyles.]]
The 1770s were notable for extreme [[hair]]styles and [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] which were built up very high, and often incorporated decorative objects (sometimes symbolic, as in the case of the famous engraving depicting a lady wearing a large ship in her hair with masts and sails&amp;mdash;called the "Coiffure à l'Indépendance ou le Triomphe de la liberté"&amp;mdash;to celebrate naval victory in the [[American war of independence]]). These coiffures were parodied in several famous satirical caricatures of the period.

By the 1780s, elaborate hats replaced the former elaborate hairstyles. [[Mob cap]]s and other "country" styles were worn indoors. Flat, broad-brimmed and low-crowned straw "shepherdess" hats tied on with ribbons were worn with the new rustic styles.

Hair was powdered into the early 1780s, but the new fashion required natural colored hair, often dressed simply in a mass of curls.

Throughout the period, men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]].  However, changes were seen in both the fabric used as well as the cut of these garments.  More attention was paid to individual pieces of the suit, and each element underwent stylistic changes.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"&gt;Ribeiro, Aileen: The Art of Dress: Fashion in England and France 1750–1820, Yale University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-300-06287-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits, the elaborately [[embroider]]ed silks and velvets characteristic of "full dress" or formal attire earlier in the century gradually gave way to carefully [[tailor]]ed woolen "undress" garments for all occasions except the most formal.

In [[Boston]] and [[Philadelphia]] in the decades around the [[American Revolution]], the adoption of plain undress styles was a conscious reaction to the excesses of European court dress; [[Benjamin Franklin]] caused a sensation by appearing at the [[France|French]] court in his own hair (rather than a wig) and the plain costume of [[Quaker]] Philadelphia.

At the other extreme was the [[Macaroni (fashion)|"macaroni"]].

In the United States, only the [[List of Presidents of the United States#List of presidents|first five Presidents]], from [[George Washington]] to [[James Monroe]], dressed according to this fashion, including wearing of [[wig|powdered wigs]], [[tricorne|tricorne hats]] and [[Culottes|knee-breeches]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=567 |title=Digital History |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723065559/http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=567 |archivedate=2010-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p1unoHtahSsC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=James+Monroe++in+wig&amp;sig=OR7Tzj7TWHiuZZ8KrR-E7t7H2Bk&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwCTgK&amp;q=James%20Monroe%20%20in%20wig |title=Real Life at the White House: 200 ... – Google Knihy |publisher=Books.google.cz |date= |accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coats===

By the 1770s, coats exhibited a tighter, narrower cut than seen in earlier periods, and were occasionally double-breasted.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt;  Toward the 1780s, the skirts of the coat began to be cutaway in a curve from the front waist.  Waistcoats gradually shortened until they were waist-length and cut straight across.  Waistcoats could be made with or without sleeves. As in the previous period, a loose, T-shaped silk, cotton or linen gown called a [[banyan (clothing)|banyan]] was worn at home as a sort of dressing gown over the shirt, waistcoat, and breeches.  Men of an intellectual or philosophical bent were painted wearing banyans, with their own hair or a soft cap rather than a wig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/franklin/rush.htm |title=Franklin and Friends |accessdate=2006-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This aesthetic overlapped slightly with the female fashion of the skirt and proves the way in which male and female fashions reflected one another as styles became less rigid and more suitable for movement and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hollander|first=Anne|title=Sex and Suits|date=1994|publisher=Kodansha|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coat with a wide collar called a [[frock]] coat, derived from a traditional working-class coat, was worn for hunting and other country pursuits in both Britain and America. Although originally designed as sporting wear, frock coats gradually came into fashion as everyday wear. The frock coat was cut with a turned down collar, reduced side pleats, and small, round cuffs, sometimes cut with a slit to allow for added movement. Sober, natural colors were worn, and coats were made from woolen cloth, or a wool and silk mix.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt;

===Shirt and stock===
[[Shirt]] sleeves were full, gathered at the wrist and dropped shoulder. Full-dress shirts had ruffles of fine fabric or lace, while undress shirts ended in plain wrist bands. A small turnover [[collar (clothing)|collar]] returned to fashion, worn with the stock. In England, clean, white linen shirts were considered important in Men's attire.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt; The [[cravat]] reappeared at the end of the period.

===Breeches, shoes, and stockings===

As coats became cutaway, more attention was paid to the cut and fit of the breeches.  Breeches fitted snugly and had a fall-front opening.

Low-heeled leather [[shoe]]s fastened with [[shoe buckle]]s were worn with silk or woolen [[stockings]].  [[Boots]] were worn for riding. The buckles were either polished metal, usually in silver (sometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style) or with paste stones, although there were other types. These buckles were often quite large and one of the world's largest collections can be seen at [[Kenwood House]]; with the French Revolution they were abandoned in France as a signifier of aristocracy.

===Hairstyles and headgear===
Wigs were worn for formal occasions, or the hair was worn long and powdered, brushed back from the forehead and ''clubbed'' (tied back at the nape of the neck) with a black ribbon.

The wide-brimmed [[tricorne]] [[hat]]s turned up on three sides were now turned up front and back or on the sides to form [[bicorne]]s. Toward the end of the period, a tall, slightly conical hat with a narrower brim became fashionable (this would evolve into the [[top hat]] in the next period).

==Children's fashion==
In the late 18th century, new philosophies of child-rearing led to clothes that were thought especially suitable for children. Toddlers wore washable dresses called [[frock]]s of [[linen]] or [[cotton]].&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, p. 171"&gt;Baumgarten, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] boys after perhaps three began to wear rather short [[trousers|pantaloons]] and short jackets, and for very young boys the [[skeleton suit]] was introduced.&lt;ref name="Baumgarten, p. 171"/&gt; These gave the first real alternative to [[breeching (boys)|boys' dresses]], and became fashionable across Europe.

==Working-class clothing==
Working-class people in 18th-century England and the United States often wore the same garments as fashionable people: shirts, waistcoats, coats and breeches for men, and shifts, petticoats, and dresses or jackets for women. However, they owned fewer clothes, which were made of cheaper and sturdier fabrics. Working-class men also wore short jackets, and some (especially sailors) wore trousers rather than breeches. [[Smock-frock]]s were a regional style for men, especially shepherds. Country women wore short hooded cloaks, most often red. Both sexes wore handkerchiefs or neckerchiefs.&lt;ref name="Styles"&gt;Styles, ''The Dress of the People'', pp. 32–36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reveal"&gt;Baumgarten, ''What Clothes Reveal'', pp. 106–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Men's felt hats were worn with the brims flat rather than cocked or turned up. Men and women wore shoes with shoe buckles (when they could afford them). Men who worked with horses wore boots.&lt;ref name="Styles" /&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], men's costume became particularly emblematic of the movement of the people and the upheaval of the aristocratic French society. It was the long pant, hemmed near the ankles, that displaced the knee-length breeches [[culottes]] that marked the aristocratic classes. Working-class men had worn long pants for much of their history, and the rejection of culottes became a symbol of working class, and later French, resentment of the Ancien Régime. The movement would be given the all-encompassing title of [[sans-culottes]], wearing the same as the working class. There was no culotte "uniform" per se, but as they were turned into a larger symbol of French society, they had certain attributes attributed to them. In contemporary art and description, culottes become associated with the [[Phrygian cap]] a classical symbol. French citizens on all levels of society were  obligated to wear the blue, white and red of the French flag on their clothing, often in the form of the pinned the blue-and-red [[cockade]] of Paris onto the white cockade of the ''Ancien Régime'',  thus producing the original [[tricolore cockade|''Tricolore'' cockade]]. Later, distinctive colours and styles of cockade would indicate the wearer's faction although the meanings of the various styles were not entirely consistent and varied somewhat by region and period.

In the 17th century, a cockade was pinned on the side of a man's [[tricorne]] or [[cocked hat]], or on his lapel.

'''''Ajax''''' is a 1936–37 painting by the American artist [[John Steuart Curry]]. It depicts a well-fed [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] bull with two [[cowbird]]s on his back. The painting is on view at the [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]].&lt;ref name="americanart"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://americanart.si.edu/artwork/ajax-71405|title=Ajax|publisher=[[Smithsonian American Art Museum]]|accessdate=2017-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The painting was made with the intention to reassure Americans after the [[Dust Bowl]] years.&lt;ref name="americanart" /&gt; According to Curry's friend [[Reginald Marsh (artist)|Reginald Marsh]], it was really a self-portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=1998|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kD3q5vidUoQC&amp;pg=PA105|title=John Steuart Curry: Inventing the Middle West|publisher=Hudson Hills|p=105|isbn=9781555951399}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Curry featured Ajax the bull in several of his works, such as the mural ''Kansas Pastoral''. The subject also became a target for mockery among those who opposed [[Regionalism (art)|regionalist]] painting and considered it superficial. The satirist Marshall Glasier mocked both ''Ajax'' and Curry's position at the [[University of Wisconsin]] with his 1948 painting ''John Steuart Curry and the University of Wisconsin Bull-Breeding Machine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|year=2006|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=raOVO4lne8UC&amp;pg=PA12|title=Got Cow?: Cattle in American Art 1820-2000|publisher=[[Hudson River Museum]]|p=12–13|isbn=9780943651323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marianne Moore]] mentions ''Ajax'' in her poem "The Buffalo".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moore|first=Marianne|authorlink=Marianne Moore|year=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KcsQNoe1ZqYC&amp;pg=PA27|title=Complete Poems|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|p=27|isbn=9781101127476}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reuse of [[Intellectual Property]] ([[Intellectual Property|IP]]) [[asset]]s (also known as Software Assets &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forrester.com/The+Move+To+An+AssetBased+Services+Play/fulltext/-/E-RES71081#/Software+Asset+Inventory+H2+2012/fulltext/-/E-RES84061/|publisher=forrester.com|title= Software Asset Inventory, H2 2012|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a strategy that many, in particular [[Information technology|IT]], companies are pursuing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/Reusable-Asset-Initiative-is-IBMs-Secret-Weapon-for-Industry-Solutions-853170/|publisher=eWeek.com|title= Reusable Asset Initiative Is IBM's Secret Weapon for Industry Solutions|accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/webservices/library/ws-assetreuse/|publisher=ibm.com|title= RWeb services and asset reuse|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy for reusing non-IT related assets is called [[Asset recovery]]. However, the term recovery is not being applied to [[Intellectual Property]] ([[Intellectual Property|IP]]) [[asset]]s.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.anthillpro.com/html/solutions/reuse.html|publisher=www.anthillpro.com|title= How Does AnthillPro Help Me Reuse My Software Assets?|accessdate=2010-04-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100310173944/http://www.anthillpro.com/html/solutions/reuse.html| archivedate= 10 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.computer.org/portal/web/csdl/doi/10.1109/ISPW.1996.654354|publisher=computer.org|title= An open architecture for software process asset reuse|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These IP assets (or software assets) can be defined as (see Forrester &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forrester.com/The+Move+To+An+AssetBased+Services+Play/fulltext/-/E-RES71081#/Software+Asset+Inventory+H2+2012/fulltext/-/E-RES84061/|publisher=forrester.com|title= Software Asset Inventory, H2 2012|accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;):
Internally developed or acquired software artifacts that IT services vendors use to automate a particular business process or aspect of product development for a range of clients. Software assets provide 30% to 90% of the solution that the client is looking for and are reused across multiple engagements.

==Benefits for the client==
Amongst other benefits, the key advantages of reusing assets are:
# Increase delivery efficiency
# Innovate from a higher level
# Use best practices
# Reduce risk
# Offer wider array of flexible solutions.

==Requirements==
In order to implement Asset Reuse within a major company, it takes at least:
* a system where to store and retrieve relevant assets
* a management system to handle the asset management
* a communication set-up to promote the reuse of piled up assets.

==Implications==
Till now a number of companies have tried to implement asset reuse. However, common implications are:
* the use of more than one asset repository
* the operation model: set-up, funding, and maintenance of the required asset management system including success tracking over a long time
* permanent cross-company communication of the asset management system strategy and its latest elements

A '''capsule review''' is a form of criticism, usually associated with journalism, that offers a relatively short critique of a specified artistic work ([[movie]], [[music album]], [[restaurant]], [[painting]], etc.).  Capsule reviews generally appear in publications like newspapers and magazines, and can range anywhere from just a few sentences up to around 300 words.

''[[Leonard Maltin's Movie Guide]]'' is a famous publication that includes hundreds of capsule movie reviews by prolific film writer Leonard Maltin, including the world's shortest capsule review according to the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]'', a 2 out of 4 star review of the 1948 musical ''[[Isn't It Romantic? (1948 film)|Isn't It Romantic?]]'' that consisted of only the word "no".

[[Image:Jencks 046 b&amp;w.jpg|thumb|260px||Charles Jencks]]

'''Charles Alexander Jencks''' (born June 21, 1939) is a cultural theorist, landscape designer, architectural historian, and co-founder of the [[Maggie’s Cancer Care Centres]]. He has published over thirty books and became famous in the 1980s as theorist of [[Postmodernism]].&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news |last= Hawcock |first= Neville|date= June 26, 2015|title= The Crawick Multiverse: sandpit becomes land art|newspaper= Financial Times |url= https://www.ft.com/content/9eeb3b26-1a63-11e5-a130-2e7db721f996 |access-date= 6 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years Jencks has devoted time to landform architecture, especially in Scotland.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt; These landscapes include the ''[[Garden of Cosmic Speculation]]'' and earthworks at [[Jupiter Artland]] outside Edinburgh. His continuing project ''[[Crawick Multiverse]]'', commissioned by the Duke of Buccleuch, opened in 2015 near [[Sanquhar]].

==Early years and family life==

Born in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland,]] on June 21, 1939, Charles Alexander Jencks was the son of composer [[Gardner Platt Jencks]] and [[Ruth DeWitt Pearl]]. Jencks attended Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts, and received his Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature at [[Harvard University]] in 1961 and a [[Master of Arts]] degree in architecture from the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]] in 1965. In 1965 Jencks moved to the [[United Kingdom]] where he now has houses in Scotland and London. In 1970 Jencks received a PhD in architectural history, studying under the radical modernist [[Reyner Banham]] at [[University College, London]]. This thesis was the source for his ''Modern Movements in Architecture'' (1973) which criticised the suppression of some Modernist variations.

Jencks has two sons by his first marriage: one works as a landscape architect in Shanghai, while the other works for Jardines in Vietnam. He has two children by Maggie Keswick: John Jencks, a London-based filmmaker, married to Amy Agnew, and Lily Clare Jencks, who in 2014 wed Roger Keeling.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Jackie. 'Dumfries Big Bang Theory Solved', Daily Record. Aug 26 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Jencks married Louisa Lane Fox as his third wife in 2006, and is thus the stepfather of her son Henry Lane Fox and daughter [[Martha Lane Fox, Baroness Lane-Fox of Soho|Martha Lane Fox]].

==Architectural design==

Jencks' first architectural design was a studio in the woods, a cheap mass-produced garage structure of $5,000 – titled ''The Garagia Rotunda'', where he spent part of the summers with his family. The ad hoc use of readymade materials was championed in his polemical text with Nathan Silver ''Adhocism – the Case for Improvisation'' in 1971 and 2013. Jencks' architectural designs experimented with ideas from [[Complex systems|complexity theory]].

His London house was designed with Maggie Keswick and [[Postmodern]] architects including [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] and [[Michael Graves]].

==Maggie's Centres==

After his second wife Maggie Keswick Jencks  died in 1995, Jencks helped co-found and [[Maggie's Centres|Maggie's Cancer Caring Centres]].  Based on the notion of self-help and the fact that cancer patients are often involved in a long, drawn-out struggle, the Centres provide social and psychological help in an attractive setting next to large hospitals.  Their architecture, landscape, and art are designed to support both patients and caregivers and to give dignity to those who, in the past, often hid their disease. Maggie Keswick Jencks is the author of the book ''The Chinese Garden'', on which her husband also worked.

==Landscape architecture and landforms==
[[File:Blackhole6.JPG|thumb|''Black Hole'' in the ''[[Garden of Cosmic Speculation]]'']]
Jencks switched to landscape design as a site for symbolic exploration when Maggie asked Charles to design in the family home and garden in Scotland. The result in 2003 was the ''[[Garden of Cosmic Speculation]]'', a series of twenty areas designed around various metaphors such as the DNA garden, Quark Walk, Fractal terrace and Comet Bridge. Further hybrid landforms and symbolic sculptures were built in Edinburgh, Milan, Long Island, Cambridge, Suncheon South Korea (with Lily Jencks), and other countries, some of which was published in ''The Universe in The Landscape'', 2011.

From 2010, Jencks started work on the ''[[Crawick Multiverse]]'', a fifty-five acre site in southwest Scotland. This project developed for Richard Buccleuch,  opened in 2015.

[[File:CellsofLife CharlesJencks 2005 Photo AllanPollokMorris CourtesyJupiterArtland 12.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|''Cells of Life'', a landform at [[Jupiter Artland]]]]
The ''Metaphysical Landscape'', was an exhibition of sculpture at [[Jupiter Artland]], 2011. Jencks later exhibited at the Merz Gallery, Sanquhar 2016.

The ''Garden of Cosmic Speculation'', designed in part by Jencks and begun in 1988, was dedicated to Jencks' late wife Maggie Keswick Jencks. Jencks, his wife, scientists, and their friends designed the garden based on natural and scientific processes.  Jencks' goal was to celebrate nature, but he also incorporated elements from the modern sciences into the design.  The garden contains species of plants that are pleasurable to the eye, as well as edible. Preserving paths and the traditional beauty of the garden is still his concern, but Jencks enhances the cosmic landscape using new tools and artificial materials.  Just as [[Zen garden|Japanese Zen gardens]], [[Paradise garden|Persian paradise gardens]], and the English and [[Gardens of the French Renaissance|French Renaissance gardens]] were analogies for the universe, the design represents the cosmic and cultural evolution of the contemporary world. The garden is a microcosm – as one walks through the gardens they experience the universe in miniature. According to Jencks, gardens are also autobiographical because they reveal the happiest moments, the tragedies, and the truths of the owner and family.

As the garden developed, so too did such sciences as cosmology, and this allowed a dynamic interaction between the unfolding universe, an unfolding science, and a questioning design. Jencks believes that contemporary science is potentially a great moving force for creativity, because it tells us the truth about the way the universe is and shows us the patterns of beauty.  As explained in his book ''The Universe in the Landscape'' (2011), his work is content-driven. His many landforms are based on the idea that landforming is a radical hybrid activity combining gardens, landscape, urbanism, architecture, sculpture, and epigraphy. Thus, the landforms often include enigmatic writing and complex symbolism. They provoke the visitor to interpret landscape on the largest and smallest scale.

Jencks has become a leading figure in British [[landscape architecture]]. His landscape work is inspired by [[black hole]]s, [[fractal]]s, genetics, [[chaos theory]], waves and [[soliton]]s. In Edinburgh, Scotland, he designed the landform at the [[Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art]] in collaboration with [[Terry Farrell (architect)|Terry Farrell]] and Duncan Whatmore of [[Terry Farrell and Partners]]. Other works include the ''Garden of Cosmic Speculation'' at Portrack House near [[Dumfries]]; Designs for Black Hole Landscape, IUCAA, Pune, India, 2002;  Portello Park, Milan 2002–2007 (Time Garden 2004–2007); Two Cells – Inverness Maggie's Centre, 2003–2005; [[Northumberlandia]] Landform, 2004; Cells of Life, Jupiter Artland, Bonnington House 2003–2010; ''Crawick Multiverse'', 2006– ;  Memories of the Future landform and reclamation project, Altdobern, Germany; Wu Chi, Black Hole Oval Terrace, Beijing Olympic Park, 2008; and The Scottish World, St. Ninians, Kelty, 2003, 2010+.

He is also a furniture designer and sculptor, completing DNA sculptures at [[Kew Gardens]] in 2003 and Cambridge University in 2005.

==Architectural writing==
Jencks discussed his theories of [[postmodern architecture]] in ''The Language of Post-Modern Architecture'' (1977), which ran to seven editions. He examined the paradigm shift from modern to postmodern architecture, claiming that modern architecture concentrates on univalent forms such as right angles and square buildings often resembling office buildings. However, postmodern architecture focuses on forms derived from the mind, body, city context, and nature. In 2007, he published ‘''Critical Modernism'',’ the fifth edition of his ''What is Post-Modernism?''

In ''Meaning in Architecture'', 1969, co-edited with George Baird, a hypertext of leading architects and theorists commenting on each other’s texts, Jencks addressed issues of who is the ultimate user of architecture, what values should be crystallised in architecture, and what  public architecture should represent. This was followed by other anthologies on [[semiotics]].

His book ''The Iconic Building'' explored trend setting and celebrity culture. He claimed that the reason that modern culture seeks the "iconic building" is because it has the possibility of reversing the economic trend of a flagging "[[conurbation]]". An iconic building is created to make a splash, to generate money, and the normal criteria of valuation do not apply. He wrote that “enigmatic signifiers” can be used in an effective way to support the deeper meaning of the building.

His book ''Critical Modernism - Where is Post-Modernism Going?'' came out in 2007. It is an overview of postmodernism in which Jencks argues that postmodernism is a critical reaction to [[modernism]] that comes from within modernism itself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-0470030100.html Wiley, Publisher]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Critical-Modernism-Where-Post-Modernism-Going/dp/0470030119 Amazon Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?video11494 TVO, Big Ideas Talk: Charles Jencks] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609234527/http://www.tvo.org/TVOsites/WebObjects/TvoMicrosite.woa?video11494 |date=June 9, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, 2007, the [[Royal Academy]] hosted a debate between Jencks and [[John N.

'''Circassian beauties''' is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the [[Circassians|Circassian people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus|Northwestern Caucasus]]. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as [[concubine]]s.

This reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], had [[Carlo de' Medici|an illegitimate son]] from a Circassian slave. During the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Persian [[Safavid]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's [[Imperial Harem]] and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in Western [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Çerkes Güzeli: Bir Şarkiyatçı İmgenin Serüveni'' [The Fair Circassian: Adventures of an Orientalist Motif], trans. A. Anadol (Istanbul: Oğlak Yayınları, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as [[ideal of feminine beauty|ideals of feminine beauty]] in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word "Circassian" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.

In consequence, most wives of several [[Ottoman Sultan]]s were ethnic Circassians converted to [[Islam]], e.g. [[Valide Sultan]]s (Empress mothers), including [[Rahime Perestu Sultan|Perestü Valide Sultan]], [[Pertevniyal Sultan|Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]], [[Şevkefza Sultan|Şevkefza Valide Sultan]], [[Tirimüjgan Sultan|Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan]], [[Nükhetsezâ Hanımefendi (wife of Abdul Hamid I)|Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi]], other important [[Khatun|Hatun]]s (Ladies) and [[Sultans]] like [[Şemsiruhsar Hatun]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Saçbağlı Sultan]], [[Haseki sultan]]s (chief consorts) such as [[Mahidevran Sultan|Mahidevran Haseki Sultan]], [[Hümaşah Sultan|Hümaşah Haseki Sultan]], [[Hatice Muazzez Sultan|Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan]], and [[Ayşe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ayşe Haseki Sultan]] besides numerous [[Kadınefendi|Başkadınefendi]]s (most senior consorts), including [[Bedrifelek Kadınefendi|Bedrifelek I]], [[Biydâr Kadın Efendi|Bidar II]], [[Kamures Kadınefendi|Kamures I]], and [[Servetsezâ Kadınefendi|Servetseza I]] as well as [[Kadınefendi]]s (senior consorts) such as [[Bezmican Kadınefendi|Bezmara VI]], [[Düzd-i Dil Kadın Efendi|Düzdidil III]], [[Hayranidil Kadınefendi|Hayranıdil II]], [[Meyliservet Kadınefendi|Meyliservet IV]], [[Mihrengiz Kadınefendi|Mihrengiz II]], [[Neşerek Kadınefendi|Neşerek III]], [[Abdul Hamid II#Second marriage and issue|Nurefsun II]], [[Reftar-i Dil Hatgil|Reftaridil II]], [[Şayan Kadınefendi (wife of Murad V)|Şayan III]], amongst many others, or [[Hanımefendi|İkbals]] (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being [[Cevherriz Hanımefendi|Cevherriz II]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Ceylanyar II]], [[Dilfirib Kadınefendi|Dilfirib I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nalanıdil III]], and [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nergis IV]] in addition to [[Hanımefendi|Gözde]]s (favourite lady consorts), including [[Abdul Hamid II|Dürdane I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Hüsnicenan III]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Safderun IV]], amongst others. The "golden age" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the [[Crimean Khanate]] and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians [[Circassian genocide|destroyed Circassia itself]].

In the 1860s the showman [[P. T. Barnum]] exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, [[big hair]] style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as "moss-haired girls". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Showmen, Disabilities and the Freak Show|last=Bogdan|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-74393-8|location=NY|pages=200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.

There were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the "Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes" (Straight, [[blonde#flaxen|flaxen]]-haired Circassian; "lepiska" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).

==Literary allusions==
[[File:Inspecting New Arrivals by Giulio Rosati 2.jpg|thumb|''Inspection of New Arrivals'', a typical [[orientalism|Orientalist]] fantasy painted by [[Giulio Rosati]] (1858–1917).]]

The legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his ''[[Letters on the English]]'', [[Voltaire]] alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:

{{Quote|The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with those beauties the [[seraglio]] of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian [[Sophy (Safavid Empire)|Sophy]], and of all of those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise. These maidens are very honorably and virtuously instructed how to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.|Letter XI, On Inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.html |title=Voltaire's Letters on the English |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Their beauty is mentioned in [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), in which Fielding remarked, "How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fielding, ''Tom Jones'', book 5, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:

{{poemquote|
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
Warranted virgin. Beauty's brightest colours
Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven.
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
Who bade on till the hundreds reached the eleven,
But when the offer went beyond, they knew
'Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
|''Don Juan'', canto IV, verse 114 }}

The legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist [[Gustav Hugo]], who wrote that "Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a "free" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] in ''The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law'' (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/08/09.htm The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law]", first appearing in Supplement to the ''Rheiniche Zeitung'' No. 221, 9 August 1842. (Excerpts online)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] reported in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' (1869) that "Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in [[Constantinople]] by their parents, but not publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Twain |date=1869 |chapter=34 |title=''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' |publisher=American Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American travel author and diplomat [[Bayard Taylor]] in 1862 claimed that, "So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the [[Venus de' Medici]]."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |author-link=Bayard Taylor |date=1862 |chapter=Circassian Beauty |title=Prose Writings of Bayard Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HN_v61_E-cC&amp;dq=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned,%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;f=false |volume=7 |publisher=[[G.

==Circassian features==

[[File:Bella Kukan.jpg|thumb|Bella Kukan, "Miss Circassia," 2013]]
An anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called "rosy pale" or "translucent white skin". While most [[Circassians#Circassian tribes|Circassian tribes]] were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes,&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmanoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=1960 |title=Babam Abdülhamid |location=Istanbul |publisher=Güven Yayınevi |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of [[Peoples of the Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=ColarussoBeauties&gt;Colarusso, John 1989. [http://johncolarusso.net/pdf/Prometheus_among_the_Circassians.pdf  "Prometheus among the Circassians"]. In ''The World &amp; I''. Washington, D.C.: The Washington Times Publishing Corporation. Pp. 644-651. Page 644: "The Circassians were famed throughout the Middle East for the beauty of their women and the courage of their men. Physically most Circassians are European in appearance with perhaps a slight oriental cast to their features. Many Circassians are blond and blue-eyed, while others show a common feature of the Caucasus: very light skin coupled with black or extremely dark hair.

In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that "the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Morison |year=2009 |orig-year=1930 |chapter=The Fair Circassian |title=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], 1745–1831: A Memoir |format=Paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publication-date=November 2009 |page=70 |isbn=978-0-521-14314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maturin Murray Ballou]] described Circassians as being of the "fair and rosy-cheeked race," and "with a form of ravishing loveliness, large and lustrous eyes, and every belonging that might go to make up a Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Maturin Murray |author-link=Maturin Murray Ballou |date=1851 |title=The Circassian Slave, or, the Sultan's Favorite: A Story of Constantinople and the Caucasus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOhEAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=circassian%20ebony&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=fair%20and%20rosy-cheeked%20Circassian%20race&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Frederick Gleason]] |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Year Among the Circassians'', John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: "She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longworth, Esq. |first=John Augustus |date=1840 |title=A Year Among the Circassians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYGeRLRf7xsC&amp;dq=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features%2C%20blue%20eyes%2C%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features,%20blue%20eyes,%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Henry Colburn |volume=1 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the "hateful race of blue-eyed cats."

{{Quote|At [[Sultan's Palace, Zanzibar|Bet il Sahel]] there was much more luxury and grand style than at Bet il Mtoni. The handsome and graceful Circassian women were much more numerous than at Bet il Mtoni, where my mother and her lady friend Medîne were the only members of this race. Here the majority of the women were Circassian, who without any doubt are much more distinguished in appearance....This natural superiority was the cause of a good deal of ill-will and envy. One Circassian woman, favoured with an aristocratic appearance, was avoided and even hated by the chocolate-coloured Abyssinian women through no fault of hers, but simply because she looked majestic. Under these circumstances it was bound to happen that occasionally a kind of ridiculous "racism" broke out among my brothers and sisters....We, the children of Circassian women, were usually called "cats" by those of our brothers and sisters who had Abyssinian blood in their veins, because some of us had the misfortune of possessing: blue eyes. Derisively they called us "Highness", a proof of how annoyed they were about us having been born with lighter skin. My father was of course never forgiven the fact that he had chosen his favourite children Sharîfe and Chole—both by Circassian mothers, Sharîfe even being blue-eyed—from the hateful race of "cats".&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruete |first=Princess Emily |author-link=Emily Ruete |date=1993 |original-date= |title=An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds: Memoirs, Letters Home, Sequels to the Memoirs |chapter=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU2w8K8IyoEC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;f=false |editor=E.

Regarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, "The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's."&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"/&gt;

The characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated "between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'."&lt;ref name="DelPlato"&gt;{{cite book |last=DelPlato |first=Joan |date=2002 |chapter=Chapter 2.

Similar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians "the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw".&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

According to the feminist [[Harriet Martineau]], Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

In parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was [[Russo-Circassian War|at war with the Circassians]]; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and "the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek".&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the girls disguised as "Circassians" exhibited by [[Phineas T. Barnum]] were in fact Catholic [[Irish people|Irish girls]] from [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=King139&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls "homoerotic".&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], in 1862, Circassian chiefs arrived to advocate their cause against Russia and to persuade Britain to stop the [[Circassian genocide|actions of the Russian army at that time]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen (2007)."The First 'Circassian Exodus' to the Ottoman Empire (1858-1867)". Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the ''Dundee Advertiser'' reported that "the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded."&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic/&gt;

===Pseudoscientific explanations for the extreme white skin===
During the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The [[doctor of medicine]] [[Hugh Williamson]], a signatory to the [[United States Constitution]], argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal [[Celtic people|Celto]]-[[Germanic peoples]] can be explained by the geographical [[Location (geography)|location]] of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where [[Prevailing Westerlies|Westerlies]] prevail from the west towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Williamson |date=1811 |title=Observations of the Climate in different parts of America, compared with the Climate in corresponding Parts of the other Continent |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|There are not any people, on the old continent, perfectly fair, except those who live in high latitudes, where the westerly winds come from the sea, at no great distance, so tempered as not to be very sharp nor very dry. This rule applies to Great Britain and Ireland, to the Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Circassians; but going to the eastward in the same latitude, as we depart from the ocean or the Black Sea, having more dry land to the windward, by which the air is charged with sun-dry exhalations, the skin changes its colour; it ceases to be perfectly fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Tilloch |editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-link=Alexander Tilloch |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-link=Richard Taylor (editor) |date=1816 |title=XLIV.

The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper to others|sign=Voltaire|source=On Inoculation}}

==Pseudoscientific racialist theories==
By the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the "white race", which was named the [[Caucasian race]] after the area by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus "the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/searchlm.php?function=find&amp;exhibit=star&amp;browse=star |title=The Circassian Beauty Archive |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that "the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Sarah S. |date=1873 |title=Cornell's Physical Geography: Accompanied with Nineteen Pages of Maps, a Great Variety of Map-questions, and One Hundred and Thirty Diagrams and Pictorial Illustrations, and Embracing a Detailed Description of the Physical Features of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6waAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Caucasian%20Race%20receives%20its%20name%20from%20the%20Caucasus&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20abode%20of%20the%20Circassians,%20who%20are%20said%20to%20be%20the%20handsomest%20and%20best-formed%20nation,%20not%20only%20of%20this%20race,%20but%20of%20the%20whole%20human%20family&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] and [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another anthropologist [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] distinguished the Caucasian race and the "Circassians who are admired for their beauty" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which "causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William |author-link=William Guthrie (historian) |date=1843 |title=A new geographical, historical, and commercial grammar |editor=Richard Alfred Davenport |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayard Taylor]] observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, "the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"/&gt;

Circassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. [[John Frederick Lewis]]'s ''The Harem'' portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in ''[[The Art Journal]]'', which described it as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Journal'', Review of the Old Water-colour Society Exhibition, 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as "Circassians".

The Circassians became major news during the [[Caucasian War]], in which [[Russia]] conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report entitled "Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the [[Constantinople]] slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/ Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey]; ''New York Daily Times'', 6 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claimed that children born to the "inferior" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.

At the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. [[Francis Davis Millet]] depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]], specifying local costume and hairstyle.

==Advertising of beauty products==
[[File:Circassian hair dye.jpg|thumb|A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye]]

An advertisement from 1782 titled "Bloom of Circassia" makes clear that it was by then well established "that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World", but goes on to reveal that they "derive not all their Charms from Nature". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this "Liquid Bloom" had been brought back by a "well-regarded gentleman" who had traveled and lived in the region. It "instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks", a "lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom of Circassia, ''New-York Gazette'', 2 September 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 "the Balm of Mecca" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: "This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montague]] who stated that it was very helpful "for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty". The article continues: "Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?"&lt;ref&gt;To the Ladies, ''New-York Herald'', 14 July 1802&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Lotion" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. "A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle' (NYC), 20 September 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Eye-Water" was marketed as "a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes",&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Gazette and State Journal, 2 February 1815&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1840s "Circassian hair dye" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Barrett (1998), Southern Living (in Captivity): The Caucasus in Russian Popular Culture, ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' 31 (4), 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century sideshow attraction==
[[Image:Circassian.jpg|thumb|As a sideshow attraction, Circassian beauties were women with [[big hair]], a reference to the teased hair they wore, held in place by beer. Circassian ancestry was not required as in this example.]]

The combination of the popular issues of [[slavery]], the [[Orient]], racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the [[circus]] leader [[P. T. Barnum]] decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a "Circassian Beauty" at his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the [[Afro]] style of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2005, pp. 68–88&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/23800/23851/Circassian_23851.htm |title=Circassian |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum's first "Circassian" was marketed under the name "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/344/ Zalumma Agra]" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could "pass for" one. However, it seems that "Zalumma Agra" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later "Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], ''Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body'', [[New York University Press]], 1996, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.

The portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the [[American Civil War]] played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,

&lt;blockquote&gt;resonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in [[dime museum]]s and travelling [[medicine show]]s, sometimes known as "Moss-haired girls". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; As the original fad faded, the "Circassians" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as [[sword swallowing]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan, ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1990, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[The Safety Fire]], British [[progressive metal]] band, released their song "[[Grind the Ocean|Circassian Beauties]]" in 2012.
*The American [[alternative rock]] band [[Monks of Doom]] released another song with the title "Circassian Beauty" in their 1991 album ''Meridian''.

[[Image:Codex Regius of Eddaic Poems and Flateyjarbok.jpg|thumb|Codex Regius and Flateyjarbók (open).]]

'''Codex Regius''' ({{lang-la|[[wikt:en:codex#Latin|Cōdex]] [[wikt:en:regius#Latin|Rēgius]]}}, "(The) Royal Book"; {{lang-is|Konungsbók}}) or '''GKS 2365 4º''' is an [[Iceland]]ic [[codex]] in which many [[Old Norse]] poems are preserved. It is made up of 45 [[vellum]] leaves, thought to have been written in the [[1270s in poetry|1270s]]. It originally contained a further 8 leaves, which are now [[Great Lacuna|missing]]. It is the sole source for most of the poems it contains. In scholarly texts, this manuscript is commonly abbreviated as [R] for Codex Regius, or as [K] for Konungsbók.

Nothing was known of its whereabouts until 1643 when it came into the possession of [[Brynjólfur Sveinsson]], then Bishop of [[Skálholt]], who sent it as a present to King [[Frederick III of Denmark]] in 1662, hence the name. It was then kept in the Royal Library in [[Copenhagen]] until April 21, 1971, when it was brought back to [[Reykjavík]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.dk/books?id=sFaC8FmqzxcC&amp;lpg=PA38&amp;ots=6USCQ420C0&amp;dq=codex%20regius%201971&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q=codex%20regius%201971&amp;f=false | title=The Return of Cultural Treasures | author=Greenfield, Jeanette | pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is now kept in the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]]. Since air travel was not to be entirely trusted at the time with such precious cargo, it was transported by ship, accompanied by a military escort&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HIUvBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=codex+regius+1971+%22ship%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FaqvzXI9C-&amp;sig=U0FWL2DLs5aFAnbn8cN3RJNm5iI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwittP6wlPneAhVoyoMKHcKIA6MQ6AEwCnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=codex%20regius%201971%20%22ship%22&amp;f=false | title=The Poetic Edda | author=Dodds, Jeramy | pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

One of the principal manuscripts of [[Prose Edda|Snorri's Edda]] (GKS 2367 4to) also goes by the name of the Codex Regius. It is made up of 55 vellum pages dating from the early 14th century. It was part of the same gift from Bishop Brynjólfur to Frederick III. It was returned to Iceland in 1985, where it is now also in the [[Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies]].

'''''Contemporary Theatre Review''''' is a quarterly [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by [[Routledge]] and covering all aspects of [[theatre]],  [[live art]], [[performance art]], [[opera]], [[dance]], [[digital performance]], activist and applied performance, theatre design, and connections between time-based arts and [[visual arts]]. The journal was established in 1992 and the [[editors-in-chief]] are Maria M. Delgado ([[University of London]]), Maggie B. Gale ([[University of Manchester]]), and Dominic Johnson ([[University of London]]).

The journal frequently publishes special issues. Recent examples include guest-edited special issues on [[Tim Crouch]], [[Martin Crimp]], race and race-blind casting, performance and activism, performance and the electoral process, editing, the London 2012 [[Olympics]], live art in the UK, and site-specificity.

As well as research articles, the journal publishes book reviews, and makes space for production notes, designs, manifestos, and interviews by emergent and established theatre-makers, which are collected in a "Documents" section. Meanwhile, the journal's "Backpages" section presents a more expansive view of theatre and performance. The journal's website offers "Interventions", responding to current developments in the field and extending discussions from the print journal through a variety of writing formats and multimedia.

== Abstracting and indexing ==

'''Daylight redirecting film''' (DRF) is a thin, flexible plastic film which can be applied to a window to refract or reflect incoming light upwards, so that the deeper parts of the room are lit more evenly. It can be used as a substitute for opaque blinds.&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt; It is a form of [[prism lighting]].

==Function==

&lt;br/&gt;
The human eye's response to light [[Weber–Fechner law#Vision|is non-linear]]: halving the light level does not halve the perceived brightness of a space, it makes it look only slightly dimmer.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} If light is redistributed from the brightest parts of a room to the dimmest, the room therefore appears brighter overall, and more space can be given a useful and comfortable level of illumination (see before and after images from an 1899 article, left). This can reduce the need for artificial lighting.

[[Refraction]] and [[total internal reflection]] inside [[prism (optics)|optical prisms]] can bend beams of light. This bending of the light allows it to be redistributed.

While the films do save energy from lighting, the savings vary substantially by climate, [[aspect (geography)|aspect]], electricity costs, and existing lighting type. At 2014 costs, including labour, payback time may be measured in decades.&lt;ref name=EEET/&gt;

This film increases the sunlight area by 200%.

It is effective not only for lighting energy but also for cooling and heating energy saving. With the growing interest in green energy buildings, the interest in these Daylight redirecting films is also growing.

==Manufacture==
Daylight redirecting film is made of [[acrylic resin|acrylic]]&lt;ref name=EEET/&gt; on a flexible polyester backing, one side coated with a [[pressure-sensitive adhesive]] (to make it peel-and-stick).&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt;

There are two types of film. Some film is moulded with tiny prisms, making a flexible peel-and-stick miniature prismatic panel. The prisms are joined at the edges into a sheet. A prism sheet is somewhat like a linear [[Fresnel lens]], but each ridge may be identical. Unlike a Fresnel lens, the light is not intended to be focused, but used for [[anidolic lighting]].

Other film is moulded with thin near-horizontal voids protruding into or through the acrylic; the slits [[total internal reflection|reflect]] light hitting their top surfaces upwards.&lt;ref name=TIR&gt;https://sweets.construction.com/swts_content_files/154130/2263001.pdf{{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt; Refraction is minimized, to avoid colouring the light.&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt;

The reflection-based films are more [[Transparency and translucency|transparent (both are translucent)]], but they tend to send the light up at the ceiling, not deeper into the room. Refraction-based films are translucent rather than transparent, but offer finer control over the direction of the outgoing light beam; the film can be made in a variety of prism shapes to refract light by a variety of angles. Refraction-based films are a lighter modern version of glass [[prism tile]]s.

Daylight redirecting window film was initially made of one redirecting film and one glare-reducing diffusing film, often located on different interior surfaces of a double-glazed window,&lt;ref name=DoD/&gt; but integrated single films are now available.&lt;ref name=OOtM/&gt;
Due to the prism structure, it works only at certain angles. By making DRF blind, you can always keep the same effect. 
Add UV blocking filters to the film to block harmful UV rays.

[[Image:Dimanche.jpg|thumb|250px|''Dimanche'', 1960]]
'''''Dimanche''''' (''Sunday''), also known as '''''Dimanche - Le Journal d'un Seul Jour''''' (''Sunday - The Newspaper for Only One Day'') is an [[artist's book]] by the French artist [[Yves Klein]]. Taking the form of a 4-page Sunday [[broadsheet]], the piece was published on Sunday 27 November 1960 and sold on newsstands throughout [[Paris]] for one day only, as well as being handed out at a press conference held by Klein at the Galerie Rive Droite at 11.00am on the same day.

An early example of [[conceptual art]], it is most famous for being the first time that the photo-montage commonly known as ''The Leap Into The Void'' was published.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'Dimanche combines appropriation, performance, actionism, conceptual art, and photo-montage all in one, and hints at this range of art movements just then coming into existence. It takes the form of a one-day newspaper, designed as an alternative to the regular Sunday paper, and includes texts and visual works by Klein, including his manifesto, "Theatre du Vide" (Theater of the Void). The photograph, captioned "Un homme dans l'espace" (A man in open space) depicts the artist leaping from his dealer's second-story window into the void. It inspired numerous artists to explore their bodies as a medium for art.' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artsconnected.org/resource/84870/dimanche Artsconnected.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The festival of avant-garde art==
[[Image:Klein-newsstand.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A parisian news stand selling ''Dimanche'', November 27, 1960]]
The work was part of the second ''Festival d’Art d’Avant-Garde'' (''Festival of Avant-garde Art'') at the Palais des Expositions, Porte de Versailles, Paris. Taking the form of a parody of the French newspaper 'Journal du Dimanche', the Sunday edition of [[France Soir]], the book presents Klein’s ideas about the ''Théâtre du Vide'' (''Theatre of the Void'') and was the first time the famous photo ''Un Homme Dans L’Espace-Le Peintre de l’Espace se Jette Dans le Vide!'' (''Man In Space! The Painter of Space Throws Himself into The Void!'') was published.

According to Klein, the intention was to declare the entire 24-hour period an international theatrical happening, 'a holiday, a veritable spectacle of the void, at the culminating point of my theories.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Dimanche&lt;/ref&gt;' Merging art and life seamlessly, Klein's theatre would encapsulate each spectator's life as they lived it on that day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coskunfineart.com/biography.asp?artistID=35 Yves Klein (1928 - 1962 - Biographical information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Several thousand copies were printed and distributed to news stands throughout Paris, with the help of Klein's friends. The artwork cost 0.35 [[French franc#The new franc|Francs]] and sold well.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt;

==The book itself==

===The ''Leap into the Void''===
The most famous section of the book was the photographic collage, published with the caption 'The painter of space throws himself into the void! &lt;ref&gt;French; 'Le peintre de l'espace se jette dans le vide'&lt;/ref&gt;' but usually known as the ''Leap Into The Void''. This photomontage, taken by [[Harry Shunk]], was montaged from a number of photos. The leap itself took place at 3 Rue Gentil Bernard, Fontenay-Aux_Roses, in October 1960, using about a dozen [[Judoka]]s from a Judo School opposite, holding a large tarpaulin to land on.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p220&lt;/ref&gt; Klein himself was a 4th Dan Judo Master. Shunk then montaged a shot of the empty street onto the photo. In fact there were 3 versions of this photo produced; one with Klein’s 2CV was never used; the one with a train and a cyclist was used for Dimanche; the third with an empty street and without the train was requested by Klein himself the next day to be used in the forthcoming catalogue for his retrospective at [[Krefeld]]. This strategy of employing two versions of the same montage, effectively bringing attention to the deception was typical of Klein's artistic strategy.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I am the painter of Space. I am not an abstract painter but, on the contrary, a figurative and realist painter. Let's be honest, in order to paint space, I must put myself on the spot, in space itself." Yves Klein, quoted underneath the photo 'Man In Space' on the front cover of Dimanche&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Yves Klein, Sidra Stich, Hayward Gallery, p217&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''Theatre of the Void''===
As well as declarations of intent, the book contains a series of theatre pieces, ''Théâtre du Vide'' (''Theatre of the Void'') that prefigure various [[Fluxus|Fluxus scores]] of a kind that would later come to be known as [[happenings]].
Pieces contained within the book include;

''Sleep''; The setting is a bedroom. The scene opens with a man asleep in a big bed. The actor must really be sleeping. Each performance lasts about 10 minutes and in silence. There is to be applause at the end.

''Inversion''; For one performance, any play will be presented upside down. All the actors will have their feet on the ceiling and their heads hanging down. This will be possible by trickery. All the furniture will also be on the ceiling, which will really be the floor. A chandelier will therefore levitate in space.

''The Five Rooms''; In order to promote the feeling and matter without the intermediary of energy,  spectators pass through 5 rooms, their feet bound by ball and chain. 9 monochrome blue paintings of the same format are in the first room; the second room is empty and entirely white; nine monogold paintings of the same format are in the third room; the fourth room is empty and dark, almost black; 9 monopink paintings of the same format are in the fifth room.

''From Dizziness to Prestige''; Having practiced levitation and attempted a kind of purifying sublimation by which he would free himself from the exasperation of the ego, and having created or proposed various aerostatic sculptures that were free from the enslavement of pedestals, Klein presents himself on stage stretched out in space a few meters above the ground for 5 or 10 minutes. The performance takes place without commentary.

These pieces hover between the possible and the imaginary, establishing that the pieces aren’t meant to exist literally, but in the mind of the reader. This prefigures many of the concerns of [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref name="weitemeier"&gt;Klein By Hannah Weitemeier, Taschen, p51&lt;/ref&gt; The book also contained a b/w reproduction of an [[International Klein Blue]] monochrome painting, and some sketches of [[Judo]] manoeuvres.

Whilst some of the pieces relate to earlier writings and statements by Klein, most were written in a hectic four-day period immediately prior to publication, in a bar with friends.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Klein, Berggruen, Hollein, Pfeiffer, Hatje Kantz&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"[[Joseph Kosuth]] hailed him as the father of conceptual art; the [[fluxus]] movement, happenings, performances, and body art, each in its own way, was structurally related to [Klein's] work. What these streams had in common was an incentive to discover a mode of creativity that transcended national frontiers, to define its aesthetic criteria, and to disseminate the results. In this process, Klein figured in the classical role of emissary, heralding a new culture to come- invisible to the eye, yet universally present nonetheless." Hannah Weitemeier &lt;ref name="weitemeier"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{for|the painting method|Encaustic painting}}
'''Encaustic tiles''' are [[ceramic]] [[tile]]s in which the pattern or figure on the surface is not a product of the [[ceramic glaze|glaze]] but of different colors of [[clay]].  They are usually of two colors but a tile may be composed of as many as six. The pattern appears inlaid into the body of the tile, so that the design remains as the tile is worn down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.channel4.com/4homes/design-decorate/decorating-ideas/what-are-encaustic-tiles-08-06-10 |title=What Are Encaustic Tiles? – Channel4 – 4Homes |first= |last= |work=channel4.com |year=2013 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Encaustic tiles may be glazed or unglazed and the inlay may be as shallow as an eighth of an inch, as is often the case with "printed" encaustic tile from the later [[medieval period]], or as deep as a quarter inch.

==History==
[[Image:MintonTile3.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Mintons Ltd|Minton]] encaustic tiles awaiting installation at the [[United States Capitol]].]]
[[File:St James Boroughbridge (148).JPG|thumb|[[Victorian era|Victorian]] English [[Gothic Revival]] tiles]]
What were called encaustic tiles in the [[Victorian era]] were originally called inlaid tiles during the medieval period. The use of the word "encaustic" to describe an inlaid tile of two or more colors is linguistically incorrect. The word encaustic from {{lang-grc|ἐγκαυστικός}} means "burning in" from the {{lang|grc|ἐν}} ''en'', "in" and {{lang|grc|καίειν}} ''kaiein'', "to burn".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/encaustic |title=Encaustic – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary |first= |last= |work=merriam-webster.com |year=2013 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originally described a process of painting with a [[beeswax]]-based paint that was then fixed with heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.encaustic.co/ |title=what is encaustic ? encaustic.co – home page |first= |last= |work=encaustic.co |year=2012 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also applied to a process of medieval enameling. The term did not come into use when describing tile until the nineteenth century. Supposedly, Victorians thought that the two colour tiles strongly resembled enamel work and so called them encaustic. Despite the error, the term has now been in common use for so long that it is an accepted name for inlaid tile work.

Encaustic or inlaid tiles enjoyed two periods of great popularity. The first came in the thirteenth century and lasted until [[Henry VIII of England|Henry the Eighth]]'s reformation in the sixteenth century. 

The second came when the tiles caught the attention of craftsmen during the [[Gothic Revival]] era, who after much trial and error mass-produced these tiles, and made them available to the general public. During both periods, tiles were made across Western Europe, though the center of tile production was in [[England]]. Companies in the [[United States of America|United States]] also made encaustic tile during the [[Gothic Revival architecture]] style's period. The [[American Encaustic Tiling Company]] of [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]], Ohio, was active until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tileheritage.org/THF-TileoftheMonth-Apr-04.html |title=tileheritage.org |first= |last= |work=tileheritage.org |year=2009 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 1930s, encaustic tiling began to lose ground to more affordable [[Glass tile|glass]] and vitreous glass tiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Menhem|first1=Chantal|title=Encaustic Tiles: Finding Renewed Popularity|url=http://blog.mozaico.com/encaustic-tiles-finding-renewed-popularity/|publisher=Mozaico|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manufacture ==
Modern encaustic tiles use a two-shot moulding process. The 'inlay' colour is moulded first. For multiple colours, a mould with cavities for each colour is used and the individual colours are filled carefully. This coloured clay is then placed face-down in a mould that is backfilled with the body colour. The tiles are then fired.

The manufacture of encaustic clay tiles may be seen today at the [[Jackfield Tile Museum]], one of the [[Ironbridge Gorge]] museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
  |title=Jackfield Tile Museum

  |publisher=[[Ironbridge Gorge Museum Trust]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
In both medieval times and in the nineteenth and twentieth century [[Gothic Revival]], tiles were most often made for and laid in churches. Even tiles that were laid in private homes were often copies of those found in religious settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/informguide-ceramicfloor.pdf |title=Inform Guide – Ceramic Tiled Flooring – informguide-ceramicfloor.pdf |first= |last= |work=pdf.js |year=2009 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Encaustic tile floors exist all over Europe and North America, but are most prevalent in England where the greatest numbers of inlaid tiles were made.{{CN|date=November 2016}}

'''Entertainment''' is a form of activity that holds the attention and [[Interest (emotion)|interest]] of an [[audience]], or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (Oxford University Press, 1971, Vol 1 pp.&amp;nbsp;213–14) gives Latin and French origins for the word, including ''inter'' (among) + ''tenir'' (to hold) as derivations, giving translations of "to hold mutually" or "to hold intertwined" and "to engage, keep occupied, the [[attention]] thoughts or time (of a person)". It also provides words like "merry-making", "pleasure", "delight", as well as "to receive as a guest and show hospitality to". It cites a 1490 usage by [[William Caxton]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. [[Storytelling]], [[music]], [[drama]], [[dance]], and different kinds of [[performance]] exist in all cultures, were supported in [[Court (royal)|royal courts]], developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an [[entertainment industry]] that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a [[banquet]] adapted for two; to any size or type of [[party]], with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.

The experience of being entertained has come to be strongly associated with [[amusement]], so that one common understanding of the idea is [[fun]] and laughter, although many entertainments have a serious purpose. This may be the case in the various forms of [[ceremony]], celebration, [[religious festival]], or [[satire]] for example. Hence, there is the possibility that what appears as entertainment may also be a means of achieving [[insight]] or intellectual growth.

An important aspect of entertainment is the audience, which turns a private [[recreation]] or [[leisure]] activity into entertainment. The audience may have a passive role, as in the case of persons watching a [[Play (theatre)|play]], [[opera]], [[television show]], or [[film]]; or the audience role may be active, as in the case of [[game]]s, where the participant/audience roles may be routinely reversed. Entertainment can be public or private, involving formal, scripted performance, as in the case of [[theatre]] or [[concert]]s; or unscripted and spontaneous, as in the case of [[List of traditional children's games|children's games]]. Most forms of entertainment have persisted over many centuries, evolving due to changes in culture, technology, and fashion for example with [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]]. Films and [[video game]]s, for example, although they use newer media, continue to [[storytelling|tell stories]], present drama, and play music. [[Festival]]s devoted to [[music festival|music]], [[Film festival|film]], or [[Competitive dance|dance]] allow audiences to be entertained over a number of consecutive days.

Some activities that were once considered entertaining, particularly public punishments, have been removed from the public arena. Others, such as [[fencing]] or [[archery]], once necessary skills for some, have become serious [[sport]]s and even [[professional|professions]] for the participants, at the same time developing into entertainment with wider appeal for bigger audiences. In the same way, other necessary skills, such as [[cooking]], have developed into performances among professionals, staged as global competitions and then broadcast for entertainment. What is entertainment for one group or individual may be regarded as work by another.

The familiar forms of entertainment have the capacity to cross over different media and have demonstrated a seemingly unlimited potential for creative [[remix]]. This has ensured the continuity and longevity of many themes, images, and structures.

== Psychology and philosophy ==
Entertainment can be distinguished from other activities such as [[education]] and [[marketing]] even though they have learned how to use the appeal of entertainment to achieve their different goals. The importance and impact of entertainment is recognised by scholars&lt;ref&gt;For example, the application of psychological models and theories to entertainment is discussed in Part III of {{cite book|last=Bryant|first=Jennings|title=Psychology of Entertainment|year=2006|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-5238-7|pages=367–434|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sayre&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFSayreKing2010|last=Sayre|first=Shay|title=Entertainment and Society: Influences, Impacts, and Innovations (Google eBook)|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-415-99806-9|edition=2nd|author2=King, Cynthia}} p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; and its increasing sophistication has influenced practices in other fields such as [[museology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation, Education, Entertainment?|year=2011|publisher=Channel View Publication|isbn=978-1-84541-164-0|editor=Frost, Warwick}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Revolutions|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=Oxon, New York|isbn=0-203-93264-1|authors=Macleod, Suzanne; Watson, Sheila|editor=Knell, Simon J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists say the function of media entertainment is "the attainment of [[gratification]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zillmann|first=Dolf|title=Media Entertainment –  the psychology of its appeal|year=2000|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc. Taylor &amp; Francis e-library (2009)|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-3324-2|page=vii|author2=Vorderer, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt; No other results or measurable benefit are usually expected from it (except perhaps the final score in a sporting entertainment). This is in contrast to education (which is designed with the purpose of developing understanding or helping people to learn) and marketing (which aims to encourage people to purchase commercial products). However, the distinctions become blurred when education seeks to be more "entertaining" and entertainment or marketing seek to be more "educational". Such mixtures are often known by the [[neologism]]s "[[edutainment]]" or "[[infotainment]]". The psychology of entertainment as well as of learning has been applied to all these fields.&lt;ref&gt;For example, marketers mix commercial messages with non-commercial messages in entertainments on radio, television, films, videos and games. {{cite book|last=Shrum|first=L.J.J.|title=The Psychology of Entertainment Media|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-84872-944-5|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some education-entertainment is a serious attempt to combine the best features of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entertainment-Education and Social Change: History, Research, and Practice|year=2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=1-4106-0959-6|editors=Singhal, Arvind; Cody, Michael J.; Rogers, Everett; Sabido, Miguel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Games and Learning |year=2011 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |location=London; New York |isbn=978-1-4411-9870-9 |editor1-last=de Freitas |editor1-first=Sara |editor2-last=Maharg |editor2-first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people are entertained by others' pain or the idea of their unhappiness ([[schadenfreude]]).

An entertainment might go beyond gratification and produce some insight in its audience.  Entertainment may skillfully consider universal philosophical questions such as: "What is the meaning of life?"; "What does it mean to be human?"; "What is the right thing to do?"; or "How do I know what I know?". Questions such as these drive many narratives and dramas, whether they are presented in the form of a story, film, play, poem, book, dance, comic, or game. Dramatic examples include [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s influential play ''[[Hamlet]]'', whose hero articulates these concerns in [[poetry]]; and films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', which explores the nature of knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Irwin|editor-first=William|title=The Matrix and Philosophy|year=2002|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Peru, Illinois|page=196|isbn=0-8126-9502-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was released world-wide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_ql_9 IMDb ''The Matrix'' worldwide release dates]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Novel]]s give great scope for investigating these themes while they entertain their readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Peter|title=Philosophy and the Novel|year=1975|location=Oxford, Clarendon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a creative work that considers philosophical questions so entertainingly that it has been presented in a very wide range of forms is ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. Originally a [[radio comedy]], this story became so popular that it has also appeared as a novel, film, television series, stage show, comic, [[audiobook]], [[LP record]], [[adventure game]] and [[online game]], its ideas became popular references (see [[Phrases from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]) and has been translated into many languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Simpson, M.J. |title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide |edition=2nd |publisher=Pocket Essentials |year=2005 |isbn=1-904048-46-3 |page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its themes encompass the [[meaning of life]], as well as "the [[ethics]] of entertainment, [[artificial intelligence]], multiple worlds, God, and [[philosophical method]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Joll|editor-first=Nicholas|title=Philosophy and The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|year=2012|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire; New York|isbn=978-0-230-29112-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "ancient craft of communicating events and experiences, using words, images, sounds and gestures" by telling a story&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gakhar|first=Sonia|title=The influence of storytelling on pre-service students' attitudes and intentions (MSc Thesis)|year=2007|publisher=Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; is not only the means by which people passed on their cultural values and traditions and history from one generation to another, it has been an important part of most forms of entertainment ever since the earliest times. Stories are still told in the early forms, for example, around a fire while [[camping]], or when listening to the stories of another culture as a [[tourist]]. "The earliest storytelling sequences we possess, now of course, committed to writing, were undoubtedly originally a speaking from mouth to ear and their force as entertainment derived from the very same elements we today enjoy in films and novels."&lt;ref name=Kuhns&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhns|first=Richard Francis|title=Decameron and the Philosophy of Storytelling: Author as Midwife and Pimp|year=2005|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York; Chichester West Sussex|isbn=0-231-13608-0|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storytelling is an activity that has evolved and developed "toward variety".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Many entertainments, including storytelling but especially music and drama, remain familiar but have developed into a wide variety of form to suit a very wide range of personal preferences and cultural expression. Many types are blended or supported by other forms. For example, drama, stories and banqueting (or dining) are commonly enhanced by music; sport and [[game]]s are incorporated into other activities to increase appeal. Some may have evolved from serious or necessary activities (such as [[running]] and [[jumping]]) into competition and then become entertainment. It is said, for example, that [[pole vault]]ing "may have originated in the Netherlands, where people used long poles to vault over wide canals rather than wear out their clogs walking miles to the nearest bridge. Others maintain that pole vaulting was used in warfare to vault over fortress walls during battle."&lt;ref name=Carlsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlsen|first=Spike|title=A Splintered History of Wood|year=2009|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-137356-5|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equipment for such sports has become increasingly sophisticated. Vaulting poles, for example, were originally made from woods such as [[Fraxinus|ash]], [[hickory]] or [[hazel]];  in the 19th century [[bamboo]] was used and in the 21st century poles can be made of [[Carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer|carbon fibre]].&lt;ref name=Carlsen/&gt; Other activities, such as [[Stilts|walking on stilts]], are still seen in [[circus]] performances in the 21st century. [[Gladiator|Gladiatorial combats]], also known as "gladiatorial games", popular during Roman times, provide a good example of an activity that is a combination of sport, punishment, and entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Gladiators: violence and spectacle in ancient Rome|author = Dunkle, Roger| year= 2008| location = Harlow, England; New York| publisher = Pearson/Longman| isbn = 9781405807395}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Medieval Sport: Quest for Survival | author1=Wiseman, Douglas C. | year=1977  | publisher=Distributed by ERIC Clearinghouse Microfiche }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to what is regarded as entertainment can occur in response to cultural or historical shifts. Hunting wild animals, for example, was introduced into the [[Roman Empire]] from [[Carthage]] and became a popular public entertainment and spectacle, supporting an international trade in wild animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Potter|first=David Stone|title=Life, Death, and Entertainment in the Roman Empire|year=1999|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-10924-3|page=308|author2=Mattingly, David J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entertainment also evolved into different forms and expressions as a result of social upheavals such as wars and revolutions. During the Chinese [[Cultural Revolution]], for example, [[Revolutionary opera]] was sanctioned by the Communist party and [[World War I]], the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Russian revolution]] all affected entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roshwald|first=Aviel|title=European Culture in the Great War: The Arts, Entertainment and Propaganda, 1914–1918|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-57015-8|author2=Stites, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinrich|first=Anselm|title=Heinrich, Entertainment, propaganda, education: regional theatre in Germany and Britain between 1918 and 1945|year=2007|publisher=University of Hertfordshire Press|location=Hatfield, England|isbn=978-1-902806-74-7|editor=Meech, Tony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arthur|first=Max|title=When this bloody war is over: soldiers' songs from the First World War|year=2001|publisher=Piatkus|location=London|isbn=0-7499-2252-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David Horn, Dave Laing, Paul Oliver, Peter Wicke, Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society,"&gt;{{cite book|title=Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World Part 1 Media, Industry, Society|year=2003|publisher=Continuum|isbn=0-8264-6321-5|authors=Laing, Dave; Oliver, Paul; Wicke, Peter|editor=Horn, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McReynolds|first=Louise|title=Russia at Play: Leisure Activities at the End of the Tsarist Era|year=2003|publisher=Cornell University|isbn=0-8014-4027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relatively minor changes to the form and venue of an entertainment continue to come and go as they are affected by the period, fashion, culture, technology, and economics. For example, a story told in dramatic form can be presented in an open-air theatre, a [[music hall]], a [[Movie theater|movie theatre]], a [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]], or as technological possibilities advanced, via a personal electronic device such as a [[tablet computer]]. Entertainment is provided for mass audiences in purpose-built structures such as a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]], [[auditorium]], or [[stadium]]. One of the most famous venues in the Western world, the [[Colosseum]], "dedicated [[Before common era|AD]]&amp;nbsp;80 with a hundred days of games, held fifty thousand spectators," and in it audiences "enjoyed "blood sport with the trappings of stage shows".{{sfnp|ref=harv|McDonald Walton|2007|p=51}} [[Spectacle]]s, competitions, [[Racing|races]], and sports were once presented in this purpose-built arena as public entertainment. New stadia continue to be built to suit the ever more sophisticated requirements of global audiences.

=== Court entertainment ===
[[File:Codex Manesse 192v - Albrecht von Rapperswil.jpg|thumb|left|Tournament before an audience and musicians (14th century)]]
[[File:Ralph Hedley The tournament 1898.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ralph Hedley]] ''The Tournament'' (1898) Children adapting a courtly entertainment]]
Imperial and royal courts have provided training grounds and support for professional entertainers, with different cultures using palaces, castles and forts in different ways. In the [[Maya civilization|Maya city states]], for example, "spectacles often took place in large plazas in front of palaces; the crowds gathered either there or in designated places from which they could watch at a distance."&lt;ref name=Walthall&gt;{{cite book|title=Servants of the Dynasty: Palace Women in World History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-520-25443-5|editor=Walthall, Anne|ref=CITEREFWalthall2008}} pp.&amp;nbsp;4–5.&lt;/ref&gt; Court entertainments also crossed cultures. For example, the [[Durbar (court)|durbar]] was introduced to India by the [[Mughal emperors|Mughals]], and passed onto the [[British Empire]], which then followed Indian tradition: "institutions, titles, customs, ceremonies by which a [[Maharaja]] or [[Nawab]] were installed&amp;nbsp;... the exchange of official presents&amp;nbsp;... the order of precedence", for example, were "all inherited from&amp;nbsp;... the Emperors of Delhi".&lt;ref name="Indian Princes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Charles|authorlink = Charles Allen (writer)|last2 = Dwivedi|first2=Sharada|authorlink2 = Sharada Dwivedi|title=Lives of the Indian Princes|year=1984|publisher=Century Publishing|location=London|isbn=0-7126-0910-5|page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, the "court entertainment dance" was "originally performed in the palace for entertainment at court banquets."&lt;ref name="Van Zile"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Van Zile|first=Judy|title=Perspectives on Korean Dance|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Middletown, Connecticut|isbn=0-8195-6494-X}} p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Court entertainment often moved from being associated with the court to more general use among [[commoner]]s. This was the case with "masked dance-dramas" in Korea, which "originated in conjunction with village [[Shamanism|shaman]] rituals and eventually became largely an entertainment form for commoners".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=9}} [[Nautch]] dancers in the Mughal Empire performed in Indian courts and palaces. Another evolution, similar to that from courtly entertainment to common practice, was the transition from religious ritual to secular entertainment, such as happened during the [[Goryeo]] dynasty with the Narye festival. Originally "solely religious or ritualistic, a secular component was added at the conclusion".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=69}} Former courtly entertainments, such as [[jousting]], often also survived in children's games.

In some courts, such as those during the [[Byzantine Empire]], the genders were segregated among the upper classes, so that "at least before the period of the [[Komnenos|Komnenoi]]" (1081–1185) men were separated from women at ceremonies where there was entertainment such as receptions and banquets.&lt;ref name=Garland&gt;{{cite book|last=Garland|first=Lynda|title=Byzantine Women: Varieties of Experience 800–1200|year=2006|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|location=Aldershot, Hampshire|isbn=978-0-7546-5737-8|pages=177–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court ceremonies, palace banquets and the spectacles associated with them, have been used not only to entertain but also to demonstrate wealth and power. Such events reinforce the relationship between ruler and ruled; between those with power and those without, serving to "dramatise the differences between ordinary families and that of the ruler".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}} This is the case as much as for traditional courts as it is for contemporary ceremonials, such as the [[Hong Kong handover ceremony]] in 1997, at which an array of entertainments (including a banquet, a parade, fireworks, a festival performance and an art spectacle) were put to the service of highlighting a change in political power. Court entertainments were typically performed for royalty and courtiers as well as "for the pleasure of local and visiting dignitaries".{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} Royal courts, such as the Korean one, also supported traditional dances.{{sfnp|Van Zile|2001|p=6}} In Sudan, musical instruments such as the so-called "slit" or "talking" drums, once "part of the court orchestra of a powerful chief", had multiple purposes: they were used to make music; "speak" at ceremonies; mark community events; send long-distance messages; and call men to hunt or war.&lt;ref name="Slit Drum"&gt;{{cite web|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=Episode 94: Sudanese Slit Drum (Transcript)|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode94/|work=History of the World in 100 Objects|publisher=BBC Radio 4/British Museum|accessdate=6 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McGregor&gt;{{cite book|last=McGregor|first=Neil|title=A History of the World in 100 objects|year=2010|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=978-1-84614-413-4|pages=613–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/FMgugdskR7eaWj_ST2fAeQ British Museum catalogue image of Sudanese slit drum]&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtly entertainments also demonstrate the complex relationship between entertainer and spectator: individuals may be either an entertainer or part of the audience, or they may swap roles even during the course of one entertainment. In the court at the [[Palace of Versailles]], "thousands of courtiers, including men and women who inhabited its apartments, acted as both performers and spectators in daily rituals that reinforced the status hierarchy".{{sfnp|Walthall|2008}}

Like court entertainment, royal occasions such as coronations and weddings provided opportunities to entertain both the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] and the people. For example, the splendid 1595 [[Accession Day]] celebrations of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] offered [[tournament]]s and jousting and other events performed "not only before the assembled court, in all their finery, but also before thousands of Londoners eager for a good day's entertainment. Entry for the day's events at the [[Tiltyard]] in [[Palace of Whitehall|Whitehall]] was set at [[History of the English penny (1485–1603)#Elizabeth I|12d]]".&lt;ref name=Bevington&gt;{{cite book|title=The Politics of the Stuart Court Masque|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-59436-7|author=Holbrook, Peter|editor=Bevington, David|pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Public punishment ===
[[File:Ticket for the execution of Jonathan Wild.jpg|thumb|160px|Ticket for the execution of [[Jonathan Wild]] (1725)]]
Although most forms of entertainment have evolved and continued over time, some once-popular forms are no longer as acceptable.  For example, during earlier centuries in Europe, watching or participating in the punishment of criminals or social outcasts was an accepted and popular form of entertainment. Many forms of [[public humiliation]] also offered local entertainment in the past. Even capital punishment such as [[hanging]] and [[Decapitation|beheading]], offered to the public as a warning, were also regarded partly as entertainment. Capital punishments that lasted longer, such as [[stoning]] and [[Hanged, drawn and quartered|drawing and quartering]], afforded a greater public spectacle. "A hanging was a carnival that diverted not merely the unemployed but the unemployable. Good bourgeois or curious aristocrats who could afford it watched it from a carriage or rented a room."&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt; Public punishment as entertainment lasted until the 19th century by which time "the awesome event of a public hanging aroused the[ir] loathing of writers and philosophers".&lt;ref name=Gay&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Peter Gay|last=Gay|first=Peter|title=Schnitzler's Century – The making of middle-class culture 1815–1914|year=2002|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Co|location=New York; London|isbn=0-393-32363-3|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] and [[William Makepeace Thackeray|Thackeray]] wrote about a hanging in [[Newgate Prison]] in 1840, and "taught an even wider public that executions are obscene entertainments".&lt;ref name=Gay/&gt;

== Children ==
{{Main article|Play (activity)}}
[[File:Pieter Bruegel d. Ä. 041b.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]] ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'' (1560)]]

Children's entertainment is centred on [[Play (activity)|play]] and is significant for their growth. Entertainment is also provided to children or taught to them by adults and many activities that appeal to them such as [[puppet]]s, [[clown]]s, [[pantomime]]s and [[cartoon]]s are also enjoyed by adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Brien|first=John|title=Harlequin Britain: Pantomime and Entertainment, 1690–1760|year=2004|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore|isbn=0-8018-7910-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geipel|first=John|title=The cartoon: a short history of graphic comedy and satire|year=1972|publisher=Newton Abbot: David &amp; Charles|isbn=0-7153-5328-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children have always played games. It is accepted that as well as being entertaining, playing games helps children's development. One of the most famous visual accounts of children's games is a painting by [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] called ''[[Children's Games (Bruegel)|Children's Games]]'', painted in 1560. It depicts children playing a range of games that presumably were typical of the time. Many of these games, such as [[Marble (toy)|marbles]], [[hide-and-seek]], blowing [[soap bubble]]s and [[Piggy-back (transportation)|piggyback riding]] continue to be played.

[[File:Israel Rating.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Example of a rating system specifying age appropriateness (Israel)]]
Most forms of entertainment can be or are modified to suit children's needs and interests. During the 20th century, starting with the often criticised but nonetheless important work of [[G. Stanley Hall]], who "promoted the link between the study of development and the 'new' laboratory psychology",&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last1=Thompson |first1=Dennis |last2=Hogan |first2=John D. |last3=Clark |first3=Philip M. |title=Developmental Psychology in Historical Perspective |year=2012 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |location=Malden, Massachusetts; Oxford |isbn=978-1-4051-6747-5 |page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially with the work of [[Jean Piaget]], who "saw cognitive development as being analogous to biological development",{{sfnp|Thompson|2012|p=114}} it became understood that the [[Developmental psychology|psychological development]] of children occurs in stages and that their capacities differ from adults. Hence, stories and activities, whether in books, film, or video games were developed specifically for child audiences. Countries have responded to the special needs of children and the rise of digital entertainment by developing systems such as [[television content rating systems]], to guide the public and the [[entertainment industry]].

In the 21st century, as with adult products, much entertainment is available for children on the internet for private use. This constitutes a significant change from earlier times. The amount of time expended by children indoors on screen-based entertainment and the "remarkable collapse of children's engagement with nature" has drawn criticism for its negative effects on [[imagination]], adult [[cognition]] and [[Subjective well-being|psychological well-being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cobb|first=Edith|title=The ecology of imagination in childhood|year=1977|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-231-03870-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Louv|first=Richard|title=[[Last Child in the Woods]]: saving our children from nature-deficit disorder|year= 2005|publisher=Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill|location=Chapel Hill, North Carolina|isbn=1-56512-391-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature"&gt;{{cite news|last=Monbiot|first=George|title=If children lose contact with nature they won't fight for it|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/nov/19/children-lose-contact-with-nature|accessdate=29 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Banquets ===
[[Banquet]]s have been a venue for entertainment since ancient times, continuing until the 21st century, when they are still being used for many of their original purposes{{snd}} to impress visitors, especially important ones ('''4''', '''6''', '''9'''); to show hospitality ('''2''', '''4''', '''8'''); as an occasion to showcase supporting entertainments such as music or dancing, or both ('''2''', '''3'''). They were an integral part of court entertainments ('''3''', '''4''') and helped entertainers develop their skills ('''2''', '''3'''). They are also important components of celebrations such as coronations ('''9'''), weddings ('''7'''), [[birthday]]s ('''10''') civic or political achievements ('''5'''), military engagements or victories ('''6''') as well as religious obligations ('''1'''). In modern times, banquets are commercially available, for example, in restaurants ('''10''') and combined with a performance in [[dinner theater|dinner theatres]]. Cooking by professional [[chef]]s has also become a form of entertainment as part of global competitions such as the [[Bocuse d'Or]].

=== Music ===
{{Main article|Music}}
[[File:A full house, seen from the rear of the stage, at the Metropolitan Opera House for a concert by pianist Josef Hofmann, 1 - NARA - 541890.tif|thumb|left|A full house at the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City, waiting for a musical entertainment to begin (1937)]]
Music is a supporting component of many kinds of entertainment and most kinds of performance. For example, it is used to enhance storytelling, it is indispensable in dance ('''1''', '''4''') and opera, and is usually incorporated into dramatic film or theatre productions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|title=A concise history of western music|year=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-84294-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music is also a universal and popular type of entertainment on its own, constituting an entire performance such as when [[concert]]s are given ('''2''', '''4''', '''5''', '''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9''' ). Depending on the [[rhythm]], [[Musical instrument|instrument]], performance and style, music is divided into many genres, such as [[classical music|classical]], [[jazz]], [[Folk music|folk]], ('''4''', '''5''', '''8'''), [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music]] ('''6''', '''9''') or traditional ('''1''', '''3'''). Since the 20th century, performed music, once available only to those who could pay for the performers, has been available cheaply to individuals by the entertainment industry, which broadcasts it or pre-records it for sale.

The wide variety of musical performances, whether or not they are artificially [[Amplifier|amplified]] ('''6''', '''7''', '''9''', '''10'''), all provide entertainment irrespective of whether the performance is from [[Solo (music)|soloists]] ('''6'''), [[Choir|choral]] ('''2''') or [[orchestra|orchestral groups]] ('''5''', '''8'''), or [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] ('''3'''). Live performances use specialised venues, which might be small or large; indoors or outdoors; free or expensive. The audiences have different expectations of the performers as well as of their own role in the performance. For example, some audiences expect to listen silently and are entertained by the excellence of the music, its rendition or its interpretation ('''5''', '''8'''). Other audiences of live performances are entertained by the ambience and the chance to participate ('''7''', '''9'''). Even more listeners are entertained by pre-recorded music and listen privately ('''10''').

The instruments used in musical entertainment are either solely the [[human voice]] ('''2''', '''6''') or solely instrumental ('''1''', '''3''') or some combination of the two ('''4''', '''5''', '''7''', '''8'''). Whether the performance is given by [[Singing|vocalists]] or [[Musician|instrumentalists]], the performers may be soloists or part of a small or large group, in turn entertaining an audience that might be individual ('''10'''), passing by ('''3'''), small ('''1''', '''2''') or large ('''6''', '''7''', '''8''', '''9'''). Singing is generally accompanied by instruments although some forms, notably [[a cappella]] and [[overtone singing]], are unaccompanied. Modern concerts often use various special effects and other theatrics to accompany performances of singing and dancing ('''7''').

=== Games ===
{{Main article|Game}}
Games are played for entertainment—sometimes purely for entertainment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a [[World Chess Championship|chess championship]]. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.

Equipment varies with the game. [[Board game]]s, such as [[Go (game)|Go]], ''[[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]]'' or [[backgammon]] need a board and markers. One of the oldest known board games is [[Senet]], a game played in Ancient Egypt, enjoyed by the [[pharaoh]] [[Tutankhamun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Botermans|first=Jack|title=The Book of Games: Strategy, Tactics &amp; History|year=2008|publisher=Sterling Pub Co Inc|isbn=1-4027-4221-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Card game]]s, such as [[whist]], [[poker]] and [[Contract bridge|Bridge]] have long been played as evening entertainment among friends. For these games, all that is needed is a deck of [[playing card]]s. Other games, such as [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]], played with numerous strangers, have been organised to involve the participation of non-players via [[gambling]]. Many are [[children's game|geared for children]], and can be played outdoors, including [[hopscotch]], [[hide and seek]], or [[Blind man's bluff (game)|Blind man's bluff]]. The [[list of ball games]] is quite extensive. It includes, for example, [[croquet]], [[lawn bowling]] and [[paintball]] as well as many sports using various forms of [[ball]]s. The options cater to a wide range of skill and fitness levels. Physical games can develop agility and competence in [[motor skill]]s. Number games such as [[Sudoku]] and puzzle games like the [[Rubik's cube]] can develop mental prowess.

[[History of video games|Video games]] are played using a controller to create results on a screen. They can also be played online with participants joining in remotely. In the second half of the 20th century and in the 21st century the number of such games increased enormously, providing a wide variety of entertainment to players around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding Digital Games|year=2006|publisher=Sage Publications|location=London; California; New Delhi|isbn=1-4129-0033-6|author=Bryce, Jo|editor=Rutter, Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newman|first=James|title=Videogames|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London; New York|isbn=0-203-64290-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Video games are popular in [[East Asia]]n countries such as South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jin|first=Dal Yong|title=Korea's Online Gaming Empire|year=2010|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|isbn=978-0-262-01476-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French poet [[Louise Labé]] (1520/1522–1566) wrote "a profound and timeless insight into reading's innate power".

''The past gives us pleasure and is of more service than the present; but the delight of what we once felt is dimly lost never to return and its memory is as distressing as the events themselves were then delectable&amp;nbsp;... But when we happen to put our thoughts in writing, how easily, later on, does our mind race through an infinity of events, incessantly alive, so that a long time afterwards when we take up those written pages we can return to the same place and to the same disposition in which we once found ourselves.'' &lt;br&gt;quote from and commentary by Fischer (2003)&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Steven Roger|title=A history of reading|year=2003|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=1-86189-160-1|ref=harv|page=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Saint [[Teresa of Ávila]] (1515–1582) read chivalrous novels and wrote about the "rapture" that books provided.

''I became accustomed to reading [novels] and that small fault made me cool my desire and will to do other tasks. I thought nothing of spending many hours a day and night in this vain exercise, hidden from my father. My rapture in this was so great, that unless I had a new book to read, it seemed to me that I could not be happy.'' &lt;br&gt; quoted in Fischer (2003){{sfnp|Fischer|2003|pp=234–35}}

[[Reading (process)|Reading]] has been a source of entertainment for a very long time, especially when other forms, such as performance entertainments, were (or are) either unavailable or too costly. Even when the primary purpose of the writing is to inform or instruct, reading is well known for its capacity to distract from everyday worries. Both stories and information have been passed on through the tradition of [[orality]] and oral traditions survive in the form of [[performance poetry]] for example. However, they have drastically declined. "Once literacy had arrived in strength, there was no return to the oral prerogative."{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=215}} The advent of printing, the reduction in costs of books and an increasing literacy all served to enhance the mass appeal of reading. Furthermore, as [[font]]s were standardised and texts became clearer, "reading ceased being a painful process of decipherment and became an act of pure pleasure".{{sfnp|Fischer|2003|p=212}} By the 16th century in Europe, the appeal of reading for entertainment was well established.

Among [[literature]]'s many genres are some designed, in whole or in part, purely for entertainment. [[Limerick (poetry)|Limericks]], for example, use verse in a strict, predictable rhyme and rhythm to create humour and to amuse an audience of listeners or readers. Interactive books such as "[[choose your own adventure]]" can make literary entertainment more participatory.

[[File:Goscinny (scenarist van de strips Asterix en Lucky Luke) (l) en Morris (tekenaar, Bestanddeelnr 924-5894.jpg|thumb|Readers entertained by comic books (1971)]]
[[Comics]] and cartoons are literary genres that use drawings or graphics, usually in combination with text, to convey an entertaining narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=James|title=British comics: a cultural history|year=2011|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-86189-855-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many contemporary comics have elements of [[fantasy]] and are produced by companies that are part of the [[entertainment industry]]. Others have unique authors who offer a more personal, philosophical view of the world and the problems people face. Comics about [[superheroes]] such as [[Superman]] are of the first type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Mike|title=Superhero comics of the Golden Age: the illustrated history|year= 1992|publisher=Taylor Publishing|location=Dallas, Texas|isbn=0-87833-808-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of the second sort include the individual work over 50 years  of [[Charles M. Schulz]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonician.com/charles-m-schulz-on-cartooning/ "Charles M. Schulz on Cartooning", ''Hogan's Alley'' #1, 1994]&lt;/ref&gt; who produced a popular comic called ''[[Peanuts]]''&lt;ref&gt;Films have been made of the ''Peanuts'' cartoons, including one [[The Peanuts Movie|released in 2015]] to celebrate the 65th anniversary of the comic strip.&lt;/ref&gt; about the relationships among a cast of child characters;&lt;ref&gt;The philosophical and theological implications of Schulz's work were explored in: {{cite book|last=Short|first=Robert L.|title=The Gospel According to Peanuts|year=1965|publisher=John Knox Press|location=Westminster|isbn=0-664-22222-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Leunig]] who entertains by producing whimsical cartoons that also incorporate [[social criticism]]. The Japanese [[Manga]] style differs from the western approach in that it encompasses a wide range of genres and themes for a readership of all ages. [[Caricature]] uses a kind of graphic entertainment for purposes ranging from merely putting a smile on the viewer's face, to raising social awareness, to highlighting the moral characteristics of a person being caricatured.

=== Comedy ===
{{Main article|Comedy}}
[[File:Dictator charlie3.jpg|thumb|Comedian [[Charlie Chaplin]] impersonating [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] for comic effect in the [[satire|satirical]] film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940)]]
[[Comedy]] is both a [[genre]] of entertainment and a component of it, providing laughter and amusement, whether the comedy is the sole purpose or used as a form of contrast in an otherwise serious piece. It is a valued contributor to many forms of entertainment, including in literature, theatre, opera, film and games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roston|first=Murray|title=The comic mode in English literature: from the Middle Ages to today|year=2011|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=978-1-4411-9588-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Grindon|first=Leger|title=The Hollywood romantic comedy: conventions, history, controversies|year=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4051-8266-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In royal courts, such as in the Byzantine court, and presumably, also in its wealthy households, "[[Mime artist|mimes]] were the focus of orchestrated humour, expected or obliged to make fun of all at court, not even excepting the emperor and members of the imperial family. This highly structured role of [[jester]] consisted of verbal humour, including [[teasing]], jests, [[insult]], ridicule, and [[obscenity]] and [[Nonverbal communication|non-verbal]] humour such as [[slapstick]] and horseplay in the presence of an audience."&lt;ref name=Garland/&gt; In medieval times, all comic types{{snd}} the [[buffoon]], jester, [[hunchback]], [[Dwarfism|dwarf]], jokester, were all "considered to be essentially of one comic type: the fool", who while not necessarily funny, represented "the shortcomings of the individual".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hokenson|first=Jan Walsh|title=The Idea of Comedy: History, Theory, Critique|year=2006|publisher=Rosemont Publishing and Printing Corp|location=Cranbury, New Jersey|isbn=0-8386-4096-6|pages=150–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hornback|first=Robert|title=The English clown tradition from the middle ages to Shakespeare|year=2009|publisher=D.S.

Shakespeare wrote seventeen [[Shakespearean comedy|comedies]] that incorporate many techniques still used by performers and writers of comedy—such as [[joke]]s, [[pun]]s, [[parody]], [[wit]], [[observational humor]], or the unexpected effect of [[irony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gay|first=Penny|title=The Cambridge introduction to Shakespeare's comedies|year=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=978-0-521-85668-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=David|title=Shakespeare's practical jokes: an introduction to the comic in his work|year=2007|publisher=Bucknell University Press|location=Lewisburg, Pennsylvania|isbn=0-8387-5680-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[One-liner joke]]s and satire are also used to comedic effect in literature. In [[farce]], the comedy is a primary purpose.

The meaning of the word "comedy" and the audience's expectations of it have changed over time and vary according to culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thorpe|first=Ashley|title=The role of the chou ("clown") in traditional Chinese drama: comedy, criticism, and cosmology on the Chinese stage|year=2007|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston, New York|isbn=0-7734-5303-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simple physical comedy such as [[slapstick]] is entertaining to a broad range of people of all ages. However, as cultures become more sophisticated, national nuances appear in the style and references so that what is amusing in one culture may be unintelligible in another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Comedy: A Geographic and Historical Guide|year=2005|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-313-32706-8&lt;!-- (set)--&gt;|editor=Charney, Maurice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Performance ===
{{Main|Performance}}
Live performances before an audience constitute a major form of entertainment, especially before the invention of audio and video recording. Performance takes a wide range of forms, including theatre, music and drama. In the 16th and 17th centuries, European royal courts presented [[masque]]s that were complex theatrical entertainments involving dancing, singing and acting. Opera is a similarly demanding performance style that remains popular. It also encompass all three forms, demanding a high level of musical and dramatic skill, collaboration and like the masque, production expertise as well.

[[File:Aida poster colors fixed.jpg|center|thumb|550px|Poster for a 1908 production of [[Verdi]]'s 1871 opera ''[[Aida]]'', performed by the Hippodrome Opera Company of Cleveland, Ohio]]
Audiences generally show their appreciation of an entertaining performance with applause. However, all performers run the risk of failing to hold their audience's attention and thus, failing to entertain. Audience dissatisfaction is often brutally honest and direct.

{{Quotation|"Of course you all ought to know that while singing a good song or, or giving a good recitation&amp;nbsp;... helps to arrest the company's attention&amp;nbsp;... Such at least was the case with me{{snd}} the [[publican]] devised a plan to bring my entertainment to an end abruptly, and the plan was, he told the waiter to throw a wet towel at me, which, of course, the waiter did&amp;nbsp;... and I received the wet towel, full force, in the face, which staggered me&amp;nbsp;... and had the desired effect of putting an end to me giving any more entertainments in the house."

==== Storytelling ====
{{Main|Storytelling}}
Storytelling is an ancient form of entertainment that has influenced almost all other forms. It is "not only entertainment, it is also thinking through human conflicts and contradictions".&lt;ref name=Kuhns/&gt; Hence, although stories may be delivered directly to a small listening audience, they are also presented as entertainment and used as a component of any piece that relies on a narrative, such as film, drama, ballet, and opera. Written stories have been enhanced by illustrations, often to a very high artistic standard, for example, on [[illuminated manuscript]]s and on ancient scrolls such as Japanese ones.&lt;ref name=Watanabe&gt;{{cite book|last=Watanabe|first=Masako|title=Storytelling in Japanese Art|year=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=978-0-300-17590-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories remain a common way of entertaining a group that is on a journey. Showing how stories are used to pass the time and entertain an audience of travellers, [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] used [[pilgrim]]s in his literary work ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' in the 14th century, as did Wu Cheng'en in the 16th century in ''[[Journey to the West]]''. Even though journeys can now be completed much faster, stories are still told to passengers en route in cars and aeroplanes either orally or delivered by some form of technology.

The power of stories to entertain is evident in one of the most famous ones—[[Scheherazade]]—a story in the [[Iran|Persian]] professional storytelling tradition, of a woman who saves her own life by telling stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yamanaka|first=Yuriko|title=The Arabian nights and orientalism: perspectives from East &amp; West|year=2006|publisher=I.B. Tauris|location=London; New York|author2=Nishio, Tetsuo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burton|first=Sir Richard (1821–1890) (in English)|title=Arabian nights. A plain and literal translation of the Arabian nights' entertainments: now entitled The book of the thousand and one nights |year=1958|publisher=Barker|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabian nights in English literature : studies in the reception of The thousand and one nights into British culture|year=1988|publisher=Macmillan|location=Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire|isbn=0-333-36693-X|editor=Caracciolo, Peter L.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The connections between the different types of entertainment are shown by the way that stories like this inspire a retelling in another medium, such as music, film or games. For example, composers [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Shéhérazade (Ravel)|Ravel]] and [[Karol Szymanowski|Szymanowski]] have each been inspired by the Scheherazade story and turned it into an orchestral work; director [[Pier Paolo Pasolini|Pasolini]] made a [[Arabian Nights (1974 film)|film adaptation]]; and there is an [[The Magic of Scheherazade|innovative video game]] based on the tale. Stories may be told wordlessly, in music, dance or puppetry for example, such as in the Javanese tradition of [[wayang]], in which the performance is accompanied by a [[gamelan]] orchestra or the similarly traditional [[Punch and Judy]] show.

Epic narratives, poems, [[saga]]s and [[allegory|allegories]] from all cultures tell such gripping tales that they have inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Mahabharata]]''; [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and ''[[Iliad]]''; the first Arabic novel ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]''; the Persian epic ''[[Shahnameh]]''; the [[Sagas of Icelanders]] and the celebrated ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of the Genji]]''. Collections of stories, such as ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales]]'' or those by [[Hans Christian Andersen]], have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rankin|first=Walter|title=Grimm pictures: fairy tale archetypes in eight horror and suspense films|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3174-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the most powerful and long-lasting stories are the foundation stories, also called [[myth of origin|origin]] or [[creation myth]]s such as the [[Dreamtime]] myths of the [[Aboriginal Australians|Australian aborigines]], the Mesopotamian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The epic of Gilgamesh: the Babylonian epic poem and other texts in Akkadian and Sumerian (English –  translated from Akkadian and Sumerian by Andrew George)|year=1999|publisher=Allen Lane|location=London|isbn=0-7139-9196-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Hawaiian stories of the origin of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Vivian Laubach|title=Hawaiian Myths of Earth, Sea, and Sky|year=1966|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=0-8248-1171-2|author2=Kahalewai, Marilyn}}&lt;/ref&gt; These too are developed into books, films, music and games in a way that increases their longevity and enhances their entertainment value.

[[Theatre]] performances, typically dramatic or musical, are presented on a stage for an audience and have a history that goes back to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic times]] when "leading musicians and actors" performed widely at "poetical competitions", for example at "[[Delphi]], [[Delos]], [[Ephesus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|title=The Cambridge companion to Greek and Roman theatre|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-83456-2|editors=McDonald, Marianne and Walton, J. Michael}} p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] and his teacher [[Plato]] both wrote on the theory and purpose of theatre. Aristotle posed questions such as "What is the function of the arts in shaping character? Should a member of the ruling class merely watch performances or be a participant and perform? What kind of entertainment should be provided for those who do not belong to the elite?"{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=93}} The "Ptolemys in Egypt, the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] in [[Pergamon|Pergamum]]" also had a strong theatrical tradition and later, wealthy patrons in Rome staged "far more lavish productions".{{sfnp|ref=CITEREFMcDonald_Walton2007|McDonald &amp; Walton|2007|p=26}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of British Theatre|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press (3 volumes)|isbn=0-521-82790-6|editors=Milling, Jane; Donohue, Joseph W.; Thomson, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stage and the spaces set out in front of it for an audience create a theatre. All types of stage are used with all types of seating for the audience, including the impromptu or improvised ('''2''', '''3''', '''6'''); the temporary ('''2'''); the elaborate ('''9'''); or the traditional and permanent ('''5''', '''7'''). They are erected indoors ('''3''', '''5''', '''9''') or outdoors ('''2''', '''4''', '''6'''). The skill of managing, organising and preparing the stage for a performance is known as [[stagecraft]] ('''10'''). The audience's experience of the entertainment is affected by their expectations, the stagecraft, the type of stage, and the type and standard of seating provided.

[[Film]]s are a major form of entertainment, although not all films have entertainment as their primary purpose: [[documentary film]], for example, aims to create a record or inform,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wyver|first=John|title=The Moving Image: An International History of Film, Television, and Video|year=1989|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Limited|isbn=0-631-16821-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the two purposes often work together. The medium was a global business from the beginning: "The [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumière brothers]] were the first to send cameramen throughout the world, instructing them to film everything which could be of interest for the public."&lt;ref name=Paris&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFParis1999|title=The First World War and popular Cinema|year=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|location=Edinburgh|isbn=0-8135-2824-0|editor=Paris, Michael}} p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, [[Pathé]] launched and distributed [[Pathé News|newsreels]]&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; and by [[World War I]], films were meeting an enormous need for mass entertainment. "In the first decade of the [20th] century cinematic programmes combined, at random, fictions and newsfilms."&lt;ref name=Paris/&gt; The Americans first "contrived a way of producing an illusion of motion through successive images," but "the French were able to transform a scientific principle into a commercially lucrative spectacle".{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=115}} Film therefore became a part of the entertainment industry from its early days. Increasingly sophisticated techniques have been used in the film medium to delight and entertain audiences. [[Animation]], for example, which involves the display of rapid movement in an art work, is one of these techniques that particularly appeals to younger audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cavalier|first=Stephen|title=The world history of animation|year= 2011|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-26112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) in the 21st century made it "possible to do spectacle" more cheaply and "on a scale never dreamed of" by [[Cecil B.

This is similar to the way that the nobility in earlier times could stage private musical performances or the use of domestic theatres in large homes to perform private plays in earlier centuries.

Films also re-imagine entertainment from other forms, turning stories, books and plays, for example, into new entertainments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rothwell|first=Kenneth S.|title=A History of Shakespeare on Screen: A Century of Film and Television|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-59404-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Story of Film: An Odyssey|The Story of Film]]'', a documentary about the [[history of film]], gives a survey of global achievements and innovations in the medium, as well as changes in the conception of film-making. It demonstrates that while some films, particularly those in the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] tradition that combines "realism and [[melodrama]]tic romanticism",{{sfnp|Paris|1999|p=17}} are intended as a form of [[escapism]], others require a deeper engagement or more thoughtful response from their audiences. For example, the award winning Senegalese film ''[[Xala]]'' takes government corruption as its theme. [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s film ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' was a brave and innovative parody, also on a political theme. Stories that are thousands of years old, such as [[Noah (2014 film)|''Noah'']], have been re-interpreted in film, applying familiar [[literary devices]] such as allegory and [[personification]] with new techniques such as CGI to explore big themes such as "human folly", good and evil, courage and despair, love, faith, and death{{snd}} themes that have been a main-stay of entertainment across all its forms.&lt;ref name=Byrnes2&gt;{{cite web|last=Byrnes|first=Paul|title=Noah review: Moments of brilliance but can't shake sinking feeling  |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/noah-review-moments-of-brilliance-but-cant-shake-sinking-feeling-20140327-35jm3.html|work=Review|publisher=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=30 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As in other media, excellence and achievement in films is recognised through a range of awards, including ones from the  American [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]], the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], the [[Cannes International Film Festival]] in France and the [[Asia Pacific Screen Awards]].

==== Dance ====
{{Main|Dance}}
[[File:Peterborough Snow Ball 2008 silent video.ogg|left|thumb|Dancers creating their own entertainment at a ball. &lt;br&gt; Peterborough (2008) (silent video)]]
The many forms of [[dance]] provide entertainment for all age groups and cultures. Dance can be serious in tone, such as when it is used to express a culture's history or important stories; it may be provocative; or it may put in the service of comedy. Since it combines many forms of entertainment{{snd}} music, movement, storytelling, theatre{{snd}} it provides a good example of the various ways that these forms can be combined to create entertainment for different purposes and audiences.

Dance is "a form of cultural representation" that involves not just dancers, but "[[Choreography (dance)|choreographers]], audience members, [[Patronage|patrons]] and [[impresario]]s&amp;nbsp;... coming from all over the globe and from vastly varied time periods."&lt;ref name="Dils"&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFDilsAlbright2001|title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader|year=2001|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|location=Durham, North Carolina|isbn=0-8195-6412-5|author=Albright, Ann Cooper|editor=Dils, Ann}} p. xviii.&lt;/ref&gt; Whether from Africa, Asia or Europe, dance is constantly negotiating the realms of political, social, spiritual and artistic influence."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} Even though dance traditions may be limited to one cultural group, they all develop. For example, in Africa, there are "[[Dahomey|Dahomean]] dances, [[Hausa people|Hausa]] dances, [[Maasai people|Masai]] dances and so forth."{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=34}} [[Ballet]] is an example of a highly developed Western form of dance that moved to the theatres from the French court during the time of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the dancers becoming professional theatrical performers.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Clarke|first=Mary|title=The history of dance|year=1981|publisher=Crown Publishers|location=New York|isbn=0-517-54282-X}} p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; Some dances, such as the [[quadrille]], a square dance that "emerged during the [[Napoleonic era|Napoleonic years]] in France"{{sfnp|Clarke|1981|p=97}} and other [[country dance]]s&lt;ref name="Wilson2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=An Analysis of Country Dancing|date=1808|publisher=W. Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; were once popular at social gatherings like [[Ball (dance)|balls]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fullerton|first=Susannah|title=A Dance with [[Jane Austen]]: How a Novelist and Her Characters Went to the Ball|year=2012|publisher=Pgw|isbn=0-7112-3245-8|author2=Le Faye, Deirdre}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wilson1"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Thomas|title=The Treasures of Terpsichore: or, A Companion for the Ball-Room|date=1816|publisher=Sherwood, Neely and Jones|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; but are now rarely performed. On the other hand, many [[folk dance]]s (such as [[Scottish highland dance|Scottish Highland dancing]] and [[Irish dance|Irish dancing]]), have evolved into competitions, which by adding to their audiences, has increased their entertainment value. "Irish dance theatre, which sometimes features traditional Irish steps and music, has developed into a major dance form with an international reputation."&lt;ref name="Wulff"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wulff|first=Helena|title=Dancing at the Crossroads: Memory and Mobility in Ireland|year=2007|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-328-2|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since dance is often "associated with the female body and women's experiences",{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=96}} female dancers, who dance to entertain, have in some cases been regarded as distinct from "decent" women because they "use their bodies to make a living instead of hiding them as much as possible".{{sfnp|Dils|Albright|2001|p=142}} Society's attitudes to female dancers depend on the culture, its history and the entertainment industry itself. For example, while some cultures regard any dancing by women as "the most shameful form of entertainment",&lt;ref&gt;van Nieuwkerk, Karin. "Changing Images and Shifting Identities: Female Performers in Egypt" in Dils &amp; Albright (2001). p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; other cultures have established venues such as [[strip clubs]] where deliberately erotic or sexually provocative dances such as [[striptease]] are performed in public by professional women dancers for mostly male audiences.

Various political regimes have sought to control or ban dancing or specific types of dancing, sometimes because of disapproval of the music or clothes associated with it. Nationalism, authoritarianism and racism have played a part in banning dances or dancing. For example, during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] regime, American dances such as [[Swing (dance)|swing]], regarded as "completely un-German", had "become a public offense and needed to be banned".&lt;ref name="Karina"&gt;{{cite book|last=Karina|first=Lilian|title=Hitler's Dancers: German Modern Dance and the Third Reich|year=1999|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=1-57181-300-4|page=174|edition=English language|others=Translated by Jonathan Steinberg|author2=Kant, Marion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in Shanghai, China, in the 1930s, "dancing and nightclubs had come to symbolise the excess that plagued Chinese society" and officials wondered if "other forms of entertainment such as [[brothel]]s" should also be banned. Banning had the effect of making "the dance craze" even greater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Field |first=Andrew David |title=Shanghai's Dancing World: Cabaret Culture and Urban Politics, 1919–1954 |year=2010 |publisher=The Chinese University of Hong Kong |location=Sha Tin, Hong Kong |isbn=978-962-996-373-6 |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ireland, the Public Dance Hall Act of 1935 "banned{{snd}} but did not stop{{snd}} dancing at the crossroads and other popular dance forms such as house and [[barn dance]]s."&lt;ref name="Wulff" /&gt; In the US, various dances were once banned, either because like [[burlesque]], they were suggestive,&lt;ref name="Butters"&gt;{{cite book|last=Butters|first=Gerald R.|title=Banned in Kansas: Motion Picture Censorship, 1915–1966|year=2007|publisher=University of Missouri Press|location=Columbia|isbn=978-0-8262-1749-3|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt; or because, like the [[Twist (dance)|Twist]], they were associated with [[African American]]s.&lt;ref name="Pruter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruter|first=Robert|title=Chicago Soul|year=1991|publisher=University of Illinois|isbn=0-252-06259-0|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; "African American dancers were typically banned from performing in [[minstrel show]]s until after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]."&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hill|first=Constance Valis|title=Tap Dancing America: A Cultural History|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-539082-7|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dances can be performed [[Solo (dance)|solo]] ('''1''', '''4'''); in pairs, ('''2''', '''3'''); in groups, ('''5''', '''6''', '''7'''); or by massed performers ('''10'''). They might be improvised ('''4''', '''8''') or highly choreographed ('''1''', '''2''', '''5''', '''10'''); spontaneous for personal entertainment, (such as when children begin dancing for themselves); a private audience, ('''4'''); a paying audience ('''2'''); a world audience ('''10'''); or an audience interested in a particular dance genre ('''3''', '''5'''). They might be a part of a celebration, such as a [[wedding]] or [[New Year]] ('''6''', '''8'''); or a cultural ritual with a specific purpose, such as a dance by [[warrior]]s like a [[haka]] ('''7'''). Some dances, such as traditional dance in '''1''' and ballet in '''2''', need a very high level of skill and training; others, such as the [[can-can]], require a very high level of energy and physical fitness. Entertaining the audience is a normal part of dance but its physicality often also produces joy for the dancers themselves ('''9''').

==== Animals ====
Animals have been used for the purposes of entertainment for millennia. They have been hunted for entertainment (as opposed to hunted for food); displayed while they hunt for prey; watched when they compete with each other; and watched while they perform a trained routine for human amusement. The Romans, for example, were entertained both by competitions involving wild animals and acts performed by trained animals. They watched as "lions and bears danced to the music of pipes and [[cymbal]]s; horses were trained to kneel, bow, dance and prance&amp;nbsp;... acrobats turning handsprings over wild lions and vaulting over wild leopards." There were "violent confrontations with wild beasts" and "performances over time became more brutal and bloodier".&lt;ref name="St Leon"&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=St Leon|first=Mark|title=Circus: the Australian story|year=2011|publisher=Melbourne Books|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-1-877096-50-1|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animals that perform trained routines or "acts" for human entertainment include fleas in [[flea circus]]es, dolphins in [[Dolphinarium|dolphinaria]], and monkeys doing tricks for an audience on behalf of the player of a [[street organ]]. Animals kept in [[zoo]]s in ancient times were often kept there for later use in the arena as entertainment or for their entertainment value as exotica.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hancocks|first=David|title=A different nature: the paradoxical world of zoos and their uncertain future|year=2001|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23676-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contests between animals are now regarded as sports{{snd}} for example, [[horse racing]] is regarded as both a sport and an important source of entertainment. Its economic impact means that it is also considered a global industry, one in which horses are carefully transported around the world to compete in races. In Australia, the horse race run on [[Melbourne Cup]] Day is a public holiday and the public regards the race as an important annual event. Like horse racing, [[camel racing]] requires human riders, while [[greyhound racing]] does not. People find it entertaining to watch animals race competitively, whether they are trained, like horses, camels or dogs, or untrained, like [[Cockroach racing|cockroaches]].

The use of animals for entertainment is often controversial, especially the hunting of wild animals. Some contests between animals, once popular entertainment for the public, have become illegal because of the cruelty involved. Among these are [[blood sport]]s such as [[bear-baiting]], [[dog fighting]] and [[cockfighting]]. Other contests involving animals remain controversial and have both supporters and detractors. For example, the conflict between opponents of pigeon shooting who view it as "a cruel and moronic exercise in marksmanship, and proponents, who view it as entertainment" has been tested in a court of law.&lt;ref name=Bronner&gt;An extensive discussion of the legal and cultural issues can be found in {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Bronner|first=Simon J.|title=Killing Tradition: Inside Hunting and Animal Rights Controversies|year=2008|publisher=The University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-2528-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fox hunting]], which involves the use of horses as well as hounds, and [[bullfighting]], which has a strong theatrical component, are two entertainments that have a long and significant cultural history. They both involve animals and are variously regarded as sport, entertainment or cultural tradition&lt;!--don't use 'either' nor 'and/or' in this sentence; 'variously' is used in conjunction with 'or' to mean they're regarded as one, two or three of these things--&gt;. Among the organisations set up to advocate for the rights of animals are some whose concerns include the use of animals for entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [http://www.league.org.uk/ The League against Cruel Sports, UK]; [http://www.peta.org/ People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), multinational]; and [http://www.sharkonline.org/ Showing Animals Respect and Kindness (SHARK), US].&lt;/ref&gt; However, "in many cases of animal advocacy groups versus organisations accused of animal abuse, both sides have cultural claims."{{sfn|Bronner|2008}}

==== Circus ====
{{Main|Circus}}
[[File:Cirque Soleil Stilt 1.jpg|thumb|Children entertained by a [[stilts|stilt]] walker performing in a circus act]]

A [[circus]], described as "one of the most brazen of entertainment forms",&lt;ref name=Stoddart&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoddart|first=Helen|title=Rings of Desire: Circus History and Representation|year=2000|publisher=Manchester University Press|location=Manchester, UK &amp; New York|page=13|isbn=0-7190-5233-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a special type of theatrical performance, involving a variety of physical skills such as [[acrobatics]] and [[juggling]] and sometimes performing animals. Usually thought of as a travelling show performed in a [[wikt:big top|big top]], circus was first performed in permanent venues. [[Philip Astley]] is regarded as the founder of the modern circus in the second half of the 18th century and [[Jules Léotard]] is the French performer credited with developing the art of the [[trapeze]], considered synonymous with circuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Diamond|first=Michael|title=Victorian sensation, or, The spectacular, the shocking, and the scandalous in nineteenth-century Britain|year=2003|publisher=Anthem Press|location=London|isbn=1-84331-076-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astley brought together performances that were generally familiar in traditional British fairs "at least since the beginning of the 17th century": "tumbling, rope-dancing, juggling, animal tricks and so on".&lt;ref name=Stoddart/&gt; It has been claimed that "there is no direct link between the Roman circus and the circus of modern times.&amp;nbsp;... Between the demise of the Roman 'circus' and the foundation of Astley's Amphitheatre in London some 1300 years later, the nearest thing to a circus ring was the rough circle formed by the curious onlookers who gathered around the itinerant tumbler or juggler on a [[village green]]."{{sfnp|St Leon|2011}}

==== Magic ====
{{Main|Magic (illusion)}}
The form of entertainment known as [[Magic (illusion)|stage magic]] or conjuring and recognisable as performance, is based on traditions and texts of magical rites and dogmas that have been a part of most cultural traditions since ancient times. (References to magic, for example, can be found in the [[Bible]], in [[Hermeticism]], in [[Zoroastrianism]], in the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalistic]] tradition, in [[mysticism]] and in the sources of [[Freemasonry]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lévi|first=Éliphas|title=The History of Magic ''(originally published in 1860 as'' Histoire de la Magie ''English edition, translated by A.E. Waite in 1913)''|year=2001|publisher=Red Wheel/Weiser|location=Boston, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87728-929-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stage magic is performed for an audience in a variety of media and locations: on stage, on television, in the street, and live at parties or events. It is often combined with other forms of entertainment, such as comedy or music and [[showmanship (performing)|showmanship]] is often an essential part of magic performances. Performance magic relies on deception, [[psychological manipulation]], sleight of hand and other forms of trickery to give an audience the illusion that a performer can achieve the impossible. Audiences amazed at the [[stunt performer|stunt performances]] and [[Escapology|escape acts]] of [[Harry Houdini]], for example, regarded him as a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Houdini: the man who walked through walls  | author1=Gresham, William Lindsay  | year=1959  | publisher=Holt}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=The Great Houdini: magician extraordinary  | author1=Epstein, Beryl| author2=Epstein, Sam  | year=1971  | location = Folkestone| publisher=Bailey Brothers and Swinfen (Reprint.

[[Magician (fantasy)|Fantasy magicians]] have held an important place in literature for centuries, offering entertainment to millions of readers. Famous wizards such as [[Merlin]] in the [[Arthurian legends]] have been written about since the 5th and 6th centuries, while in the 21st century, the young wizard [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] became a global entertainment phenomenon when the book series about him sold about 450 million copies (as at June 2011), making it the [[List of book series|best-selling book series in history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rowling 'makes £5 every second'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7649962.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=3 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter series to be sold as e-books|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-13889578|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=27 February 2013|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Street performance ====
[[File:Didgeridoo street player.jpg|thumb|[[Didgeridoo]] player entertaining passers by in the street]]

Street entertainment, [[street performance]] or "busking" are forms of performance that have been meeting the public's need for entertainment for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=David|title=The buskers: a history of street entertainment|year= 1981|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot; North Pomfret, Vermont|isbn=0-7153-8026-5|author2=Greenwood, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was "an integral aspect of London's life", for example, when the city in the early 19th century was "filled with spectacle and diversion".{{sfnp|Ackroyd|2000|p=346 (caption to plate following text pages)}} [[Minstrel]]s or [[troubadour]]s are part of the tradition. The art and practice of busking is still celebrated at annual busking festivals.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://www.coffsharbourbuskers.com/ 2012 Coffs Harbour International Buskers and Comedy Festival].&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three basic forms of contemporary street performance. The first form is the "circle show". It tends to gather a crowd, usually has a distinct beginning and end, and is done in conjunction with [[street theatre]], [[puppeteer]]ing, [[magician (illusion)|magicians]], [[comedian]]s, acrobats, [[juggler]]s and sometimes [[musician]]s. This type has the potential to be the most lucrative for the performer because there are likely to be more donations from larger audiences if they are entertained by the act. Good buskers control the crowd so patrons do not obstruct foot traffic. The second form, the ''walk-by act'', has no distinct beginning or end. Typically, the busker provides an entertaining ambience, often with an unusual instrument, and the audience may not stop to watch or form a crowd. Sometimes a walk-by act spontaneously turns into a circle show. The third form, ''café busking'', is performed mostly in restaurants, pubs, bars and cafés. This type of act occasionally uses [[public transport]] as a venue.

==== Parades ====
{{Main|Parade}}
[[Parade]]s are held for a range of purposes, often more than one. Whether their mood is sombre or festive, being public events that are designed to attract attention and activities that necessarily divert normal traffic, parades have a clear entertainment value to their audiences. [[Cavalcade]]s and the modern variant, the [[motorcade]], are examples of public processions. Some people watching the parade or procession may have made a special effort to attend, while others become part of the audience by happenstance. Whatever their mood or primary purpose, parades attract and entertain people who watch them pass by. Occasionally, a parade takes place in an improvised theatre space (such as the [[Trooping the Colour]] in '''8''') and tickets are sold to the physical audience while the global audience participates via broadcast.

One of the earliest forms of parade were "[[Roman triumph|triumphs]]"{{snd}} grand and sensational displays of foreign treasures and spoils, given by triumphant Roman generals to celebrate their victories. They presented conquered peoples and nations that exalted the prestige of the victor. "In the summer of 46&amp;nbsp;[[Before common era|BCE]] [[Julius Caesar]] chose to celebrate four triumphs held on different days extending for about one month."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurval|first=Robert Alan|title=Actium and Augustus: The Politics and Emotions of Civil War|year=1995|publisher=University of Michigan|isbn=0-472-10590-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe from the Middle Ages to the [[Baroque]] the [[Royal Entry]] celebrated the formal visit of the monarch to the city with a parade through elaborately decorated streets, passing various shows and displays. The annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in London is an example of a civic parade that has survived since medieval times.

Many religious festivals (especially those that incorporate [[processions]], such as [[Holy Week procession]]s or the Indian festival of [[Holi]]) have some entertainment appeal in addition to their serious purpose. Sometimes, religious rituals have been adapted or evolved into secular entertainments, or like the [[Festa del Redentore]] in Venice, have managed to grow in popularity while holding both secular and sacred purposes in balance. However, [[pilgrimage]]s, such as the Christian pilgrimage of the [[Way of St. James]], the Muslim [[Hajj]] and the Hindu [[Kumbh Mela]], which may appear to the outsider as an entertaining parade or procession, are not intended as entertainment: they are instead about an individual's spiritual journey. Hence, the relationship between spectator and participant, unlike entertainments proper, is different. The manner in which the Kumbh Mela, for example, "is divorced from its cultural context and repackaged for Western consumption{{snd}} renders the presence of [[Voyeurism|voyeurs]] deeply problematic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maclean|first=Kama|title=Pilgrimage and Power: The Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, 1765–1954|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-533894-2|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parades generally impress and delight often by including unusual, colourful costumes ('''7, 10'''). Sometimes they also commemorate ('''5''', '''8''') or celebrate ('''1''', '''4, 6,''' '''8''', '''9'''). Sometimes they have a serious purpose, such as when the context is military ('''1''', '''2''', '''5'''), when the intention is sometimes to intimidate; or religious, when the audience might participate or have a role to play ('''6''', '''7, 10'''). Even if a parade uses new technology and is some distance away ('''9'''), it is likely to have a strong appeal, draw the attention of onlookers and entertain them.

==== Fireworks ====
{{Main|Fireworks}}
[[File:Medellín-Juegos pirotécnicos bicentenario-11.jpg|thumb|Spectators at Bicentennial [[fireworks]] in Colombia]]

[[Fireworks]] are a part of many public entertainments and have retained an enduring popularity since they became a "crowning feature of elaborate celebrations" in the 17th century. First used in China, classical antiquity and Europe for military purposes, fireworks were most popular in the 18th century and high prices were paid for [[Pyrotechnics|pyrotechnists]], especially the skilled Italian ones, who were summoned to other countries to organise displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Giacomo Casanova|last=Casanova|first=Giacomo Chevalier de Seingalt|title=History of My Life, Volumes 9–10 Vol 10|year=1997|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|location=Baltimore, Maryland; London|isbn=0-8018-5666-3|page=333|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Jack|title=Gunpowder: Alchemy, Bombards, and Pyrotechnics: The History of the Explosive that Changed the World|year=2005|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=0-465-03722-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire and water were important aspects of court spectacles because the displays "inspired by means of fire, sudden noise, smoke and general magnificence the sentiments thought fitting for the subject to entertain of his sovereign: awe fear and a vicarious sense of glory in his might. Birthdays, name-days, weddings and anniversaries provided the occasion for celebration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagarra|first=Eda|title=A Social History of Germany 1648–1914|year=2003|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-7658-0982-7|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous courtly uses of fireworks was one used to celebrate the end of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] and while the fireworks themselves caused a fire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Christopher Hogwood|last=Hogwood|first=Christopher|title=Handel: Water Music and Music for the Royal Fireworks|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83636-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; the accompanying [[Music for the Royal Fireworks]] written by [[George Frideric Handel|Handel]] has been popular ever since. Aside from their contribution to entertainments related to military successes, courtly displays and personal celebrations, fireworks are also used as part of religious ceremony. For example, during the Indian [[Dashavatar]]a Kala of Gomantaka "the temple deity is taken around in a procession with a lot of singing, dancing and display of fireworks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Varadpande|first=Manohar Laxman|title=History of Indian Theatre (vol. 2)|year=1992|publisher=Shakti Malik Abhinav Publications|location=New Delhi|isbn=81-7017-278-0|page=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "fire, sudden noise and smoke" of fireworks is still a significant part of public celebration and entertainment. For example, fireworks were one of the primary forms of display chosen to celebrate the turn of the [[millennium]] around the world. As the clock struck midnight and 1999 became 2000, firework displays and open-air parties greeted the [[New Year]] as the [[time zone]]s changed over to the next century. Fireworks, carefully planned and choreographed, were let off against the backdrop of many of the world's most famous buildings, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the [[Giza Necropolis|Pyramids of Giza]] in Egypt, the [[Acropolis]] in Athens, [[Red Square]] in Moscow, [[Vatican City]] in Rome, the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in Berlin, the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, and [[Elizabeth Tower]] in London.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport}}
[[File:Tifosi fiorentina.jpg|thumb|Tifosi fiorentina|Audience engagement from a crowd of Italian sport fans]]
[[File:2010 FIFA World Cup Fans.jpg|thumb|Audience engagement by individual South African fans at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] ]]

[[Sports|Sporting]] competitions have always provided entertainment for crowds. To distinguish the players from the audience, the latter are often known as spectators. Developments in [[stadium]] and [[auditorium]] design, as well as in recording and broadcast technology, have allowed off-site spectators to watch sport, with the result that the size of the audience has grown ever larger and [[spectator sport]] has become increasingly popular. Two of the most popular sports with global appeal are [[association football]] and [[cricket]]. Their ultimate international competitions, the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and [[test cricket]], are broadcast around the world. Beyond the very large numbers involved in playing these sports, they are notable for being a major source of entertainment for many millions of non-players worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sport Marketing|year=2007|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=978-0-7360-6052-3|authors=Hardy, Stephen; Sutton, William Anthony|editor=Mullin, Bernard James}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comparable multi-stage, long-form sport with global appeal is the [[Tour de France]], unusual in that it takes place outside of special stadia, being run instead in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Christopher S.|title=The Tour de France: A Cultural History|year=2008|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Los Angeles; London|isbn=978-0-520-25630-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from sports that have world-wide appeal and competitions, such as the [[Olympic Games]], the entertainment value of a sport depends on the culture and country where people play it. For example, in the United States, [[baseball]] and [[basketball]] games are popular forms of entertainment; in Bhutan, the national sport is archery; in New Zealand, it is [[rugby union]]; in Iran, it is [[freestyle wrestling]]. Japan's unique [[sumo]] wrestling contains ritual elements that derive from its long history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kubota|first=Makoto|title=Sumo|year=1999|publisher=Chronicle Books Llc|isbn=0-8118-2548-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, such as the international running group [[Hash House Harriers]], participants create a blend of sport and entertainment for themselves, largely independent of spectator involvement, where the social component is more important than the competitive.

The evolution of an activity into a sport and then an entertainment is also affected by the local climate and conditions. For example, the modern sport of [[History of surfing|surfing]] is associated with Hawaii and that of [[History of skiing|snow skiing]] probably evolved in Scandinavia. While these sports and the entertainment they offer to spectators have spread around the world, people in the two originating countries remain well known for their prowess. Sometimes the climate offers a chance to adapt another sport such as in the case of [[ice hockey]]—an important entertainment in Canada.

=== Fairs, expositions, shopping ===
{{Main|Fair|World's fair}}
[[Fair]]s and exhibitions have existed since ancient and medieval times, displaying wealth, innovations and objects for trade and offering specific entertainments as well as being places of entertainment in themselves.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert|title=Great Exhibitions: The World Fairs 1851–1937|year=2007|publisher=National Gallery of Victoria|isbn=978-0-7241-0284-6|pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether in a medieval market or a small shop, "shopping always offered forms of exhilaration that took one away from the everyday".&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;{{cite book|last=Moss|first=Mark Howard|title=Shopping as an Entertainment Experience|year=2007|publisher=Lexington Books|location=Lanham, Maryland; Plymouth, UK|page=3|isbn=978-0-7391-1680-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the modern world, "merchandising has become entertainment: spinning signs, flashing signs, thumping music&amp;nbsp;... video screens, interactive computer kiosks, day care .. cafés".&lt;ref name=Moss/&gt;

By the 19th century, "expos" that encouraged arts, manufactures and commerce had become international. They were not only hugely popular but affected international ideas. For example, the [[Exposition Universelle (1878)|1878 Paris Exposition]] facilitated international cooperation about ideas, innovations and standards. From London 1851 to Paris 1900, "in excess of 200 million visitors had entered the turnstiles in London, Paris, Vienna, Philadelphia, Chicago and a myriad of smaller shows around the world."&lt;ref name=Wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World's Colombian Exposition of 1893|url=http://columbus.gl.iit.edu/|publisher=Chicago Illinois Institute of Technology|accessdate=15 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[World War II]] "well over 500 million visits have been recorded through world expo turnstiles".&lt;ref name=Boisseau&gt;{{cite book|title=Gendering the Fair: Histories of Women and Gender at World's Fairs|year=2010|publisher=University of Illinois|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0-252-03558-6|authors=Rydell, Robert; Boisseau, T.J.; Markwyn, Abigail M.; Rydell, Robert W.|editor=Boisseau, T.J.|page=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a form of spectacle and entertainment, expositions influenced "everything from architecture, to patterns of globalisation, to fundamental matters of human identity"&lt;ref name=Boisseau/&gt; and in the process established the close relationship between "fairs, the rise of department stores and art museums",&lt;ref name=Rydell&gt;{{cite book|last=Rydell|first=Robert W.|title=World of Fairs: The Century-of-Progress Expositions|year=1993|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-73236-3|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the modern world of mass consumption and the entertainment industry.

== Safety ==
Some entertainments, such as at large festivals (whether religious or secular), concerts, clubs, parties and celebrations, involve big crowds. From earliest times, crowds at an entertainment have associated hazards and dangers, especially when combined with the recreational consumption of [[Recreational drug use|intoxicants]] such as alcohol. The Ancient Greeks had [[Dionysian Mysteries]], for example, and the Romans had [[Saturnalia]]. The consequence of excess and crowds can produce breaches of [[Norm (social)|social norms]] of behaviour, sometimes causing injury or even death, such as for example, at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], an outdoor [[rock festival]]. The list of [[Nightclub#Serious incidents|serious incidents at nightclubs]] includes those caused by [[stampede]]; overcrowding; terrorism, such as the [[2002 Bali bombings]] that targeted a nightclub; and especially fire. Investigations, such as that carried out in the US after [[The Station nightclub fire]] often demonstrate that lessons learned "regarding fire safety in nightclubs" from earlier events such as the [[Cocoanut Grove fire]] do "not necessarily result in lasting effective change".&lt;ref name=Tubbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Tubbs|first=Jeffrey|title=Egress Design Solutions: A Guide to Evacuation and Crowd Management Planning|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-71956-4|page=83|author2=Meacham, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to prevent such incidents include appointing special officers, such as the medieval [[Lord of Misrule]] or, in modern times, [[security officers]] who control access; and also ongoing improvement of relevant [[International Organization for Standardization|standards]] such as those for building safety. The [[tourism]] industry now regards safety and security at entertainment venues as an important management task.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | title=Tourism, security and safety: from theory to practice | author1=Mansfeld, Yoel  | author2=Pizam, Abraham  | date = 2006 |location = Burlington, Mass.|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann  | isbn=0750678984 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Industry ==
Although kings, rulers and powerful people have always been able to pay for entertainment to be provided for them and in many cases have paid for public entertainment, people generally have made their own entertainment or when possible, attended a live performance. Technological developments in the 20th century meant that entertainment could be produced independently of the audience, packaged and sold on a commercial basis by an entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stein|first=Andi|title=An Introduction to the Entertainment Industry|year=2009|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4331-0341-4|author2=Evans, Beth Bingham}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Key issues in the arts and entertainment industry|publisher=Goodfellow Publishers |location=Woodeaton, Oxford|isbn=1-906884-20-X|editor=Walmsley, Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes referred to as [[show business]], the industry relies on [[business model]]s to produce, market, broadcast or otherwise distribute many of its traditional forms, including performances of all types.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sickels|first=Robert C|title=The Business of Entertainment|publisher=Greenwood Publishing (Three Volumes)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The industry became so sophisticated that its economics became a separate area of academic study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Harold L.|title=Entertainment industry economics: a guide for financial analysis|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=0-521-87485-8|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[film industry]] is a part of the entertainment industry. Components of it include the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/hollywood|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Mid Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bollywood]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bollywood News|url=http://www.mid-day.com/entertainment/bollywood|publisher=Mid Day|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; film industries, as well as the [[cinema of the United Kingdom]] and all the [[Cinema of Europe|cinemas of Europe]], including [[cinema of France|France]], [[cinema of Germany|Germany]], [[cinema of Spain|Spain]], [[Cinema of Italy|Italy]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Casper|first=Drew|title=Postwar Hollywood, 1946–1962|year=2007|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1-4051-5074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sex industry]] is another component of the entertainment industry, applying the same forms and media (for example, film, books, dance and other performances) to the development, marketing and sale of sex products on a commercial basis.

[[Amusement park]]s entertain paying guests with [[rides]], such as [[roller coasters]], [[ridable miniature railway]]s, [[water rides]], and [[dark rides]], as well as other events and associated attractions. The parks are built on a large area subdivided into themed areas named "lands". Sometimes the whole amusement park is based on one theme, such as the various [[SeaWorld]] parks that focus on the theme of sea life.

One of the consequences of the development of the entertainment industry has been the creation of new types of [[employment]]. While jobs such as [[writer]], musician and [[composer]] exist as they always have, people doing this work are likely to be employed by a company rather than a patron as they once would have been. New jobs have appeared, such as [[Gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or [[special effect]]s supervisor in the film industry, and attendants in an amusement park.

Prestigious [[List of prizes, medals, and awards|awards are given by the industry]] for excellence in the various types of entertainment. For example, there are awards for Music, Games (including video games), Comics, Comedy, Theatre, Television, Film, Dance and Magic. Sporting awards are made for the results and skill, rather than for the entertainment value.

== Architecture ==

=== Architecture for entertainment ===
Purpose-built structures as venues for entertainment that accommodate audiences have produced many famous and innovative buildings, among the most recognisable of which are [[Theatre (structure)|theatre structures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newhouse|first=Victoria|title=Site and sound: the architecture and acoustics of new opera houses and concert halls|year=2012|publisher=Monacelli Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58093-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the ancient Greeks, "the architectural importance of the theatre is a reflection of their importance to the community, made apparent in their monumentality, in the effort put into their design, and in the care put into their detail."&lt;ref name=MacLeod&gt;Green, J.R. "The Theatre of Paphos and the Theatre of Alexandria: Some First Thoughts" in {{cite book |title=The Library of Alexandria |year=2002 |publisher=The American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-710-8 |editor=MacLeod, Roy}} p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans subsequently developed the stadium in an oval form known as a [[Circus (building)|circus]]. In modern times, some of the grandest buildings for entertainment have brought fame to their cities as well as their designers. The [[Sydney Opera House]], for example, is a [[World Heritage Site]] and [[The O₂ (London)|The O₂]] in London is an entertainment precinct that contains an indoor [[arena]], a music club, a cinema and exhibition space. The [[Bayreuth Festspielhaus]] in Germany is a theatre designed and built for performances of one specific musical composition.

Two of the chief architectural concerns for the design of venues for mass audiences are speed of egress and safety. The speed at which the venue empty is important both for amenity and safety, because large crowds take a long time to disperse from a badly designed venue, which creates a safety risk. The [[Hillsborough disaster]] is an example of how poor aspects of building design can contribute to audience deaths. [[Sightline]]s and [[acoustics]] are also important design considerations in most theatrical venues.

In the 21st century, entertainment venues, especially stadia, are "likely to figure among the leading architectural genres".&lt;ref name=Sheard&gt;{{cite book|last=Sheard|first=Rod|title=Sports Architecture|year=2001|publisher=Spon Press|location=London|isbn=0-419-21220-5|ref=CITEREFSheard2001}} p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they require "a whole new approach" to design, because they need to be "sophisticated entertainment centres, multi-experience venues, capable of being enjoyed in many diverse ways".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}} Hence, architects now have to design "with two distinct functions in mind, as sports and entertainment centres playing host to live audiences, and as sports and entertainment studios serving the viewing and listening requirements of the remote audience".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

=== Architecture as entertainment ===
[[File:Sleepingbeautycastle50.jpg|[[Sleeping Beauty]]|thumb|left|Inauthentic castle in [[Disneyland]] amusement park]]
Architects who push the boundaries of design or construction sometimes create buildings that are entertaining because they exceed the expectations of the public and the client and are aesthetically outstanding. Buildings such as [[Guggenheim Museum Bilbao]], designed by [[Frank Gehry]], are of this type, becoming a tourist attraction as well as a significant international museum. Other apparently usable buildings are really [[folly|follies]], deliberately constructed for a decorative purpose and never intended to be practical.

On the other hand, sometimes architecture is entertainment, while pretending to be functional. The tourism industry, for example, creates or renovates buildings as "attractions" that have either never been used or can never be used for their ostensible purpose. They are instead re-purposed to entertain visitors often by simulating cultural experiences. Buildings, history and sacred spaces are thus made into commodities for purchase. Such intentional tourist attractions divorce buildings from the past so that "the difference between historical authenticity and contemporary entertainment venues/theme parks becomes hard to define".&lt;ref name=Lasansky&gt;{{cite book|ref=CITEREFLasansky2004|last=Lasansky|first=D. Medina|title=Architecture and Tourism: Perception, Performance and Place|year=2004|edition=English|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=1-85973-709-9|author2=McLaren, Brian}} p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include "the preservation of the [[Alcázar of Toledo]], with its grim Civil War History, the conversion of slave dungeons into tourist attractions in Ghana, [such as, for example, [[Cape Coast Castle]]] and the presentation of indigenous culture in Libya".{{sfnp|Lasansky|2004|p=xvii, Part II, Ch. 4, 5, 6}} The specially constructed buildings in amusement parks represent the park's theme and are usually neither authentic nor completely functional.

== Effects of developments in electronic media ==

=== Globalisation ===
By the second half of the 20th century, developments in electronic [[Media (communication)|media]] made possible the delivery of entertainment products to mass audiences across the globe. The technology enabled people to see, hear and participate in all the familiar forms{{snd}} stories, theatre, music, dance{{snd}} wherever they live. The rapid development of entertainment technology was assisted by improvements in [[data storage device]]s such as [[Compact Cassette|cassette tapes]] or [[compact disc]]s, along with increasing [[miniaturisation]]. Computerisation and the development of [[barcodes]] also made ticketing easier, faster and global.

=== Obsolescence ===
In the 1940s, [[radio]] was the electronic medium for family entertainment and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garratt|first=G.R.M.|title=The early history of radio: from Faraday to Marconi|year=1994|publisher=Institution of Electrical Engineers, in association with the Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-85296-845-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio reader: essays in the cultural history of radio|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-92820-6|editor1=Hilmes, Michele |editor2=Loviglio, Jason }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cox|first=Jim|title=The great radio sitcoms|year=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Co|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-3146-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, it was [[television]] that was the new medium and it rapidly became global, bringing visual entertainment, first in black and white, then in colour, to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spigel|first=Lynn|title=Make room for TV: television and the family ideal in postwar America|year=1992|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-76966-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, [[history of video games|games]] could be played electronically, then [[Handheld video game|hand-held]] devices provided mobile entertainment, and by the last decade of the 20th century, via [[online game|networked play]]. In combination with products from the entertainment industry, all the traditional forms of entertainment became available personally. People could not only select an entertainment product such as a piece of music, film or game, they could choose the time and place to use it. The "proliferation of portable media players and the emphasis on the computer as a site for film consumption" together have significantly changed how audiences encounter films.&lt;ref name=Tryon&gt;{{cite book|last=Tryon|first=Chuck|title=Reinventing Cinema: Movies in the Age of Media Convergence|year=2009|publisher=Rutgers University Press|pages=6, 9|isbn=978-0-8135-4546-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable consequences of the rise of electronic entertainment has been the rapid [[obsolescence]] of the various recording and storage methods. As an example of speed of change driven by electronic media, over the course of one generation, television as a medium for receiving standardised entertainment products went from unknown, to novel, to ubiquitous and finally to superseded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Television after TV: Essays on a Medium in Transition|year=2004|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=0-8223-3383-X|editors=Spigel, Lynn; Olsson, Jan}}&lt;/ref&gt; One estimate was that by 2011 over 30 percent of households in the US would own a [[Wii]] console, "about the same percentage that owned a television in 1953".&lt;ref name=Cogburn&gt;{{cite book|last=Cogburn|first=Jon|title=Philosophy Through Video Games|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0-415-98857-8|page=i|author2=Silcox, Mark}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some expected that halfway through the second decade of the 21st century, online entertainment would have completely replaced television—which didn't happen. The so-called "[[digital revolution]]" has produced an increasingly transnational marketplace that has caused difficulties for governments, business, industries, and individuals, as they all try to keep up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doyle|first=Gillian|title=Media Ownership: The Economics and Politics of Convergence and Concentration in the UK and European Media|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|format=Google eBook|isbn=0-7619-6680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=John|title=Scheduling: the last creative act in television?|journal=Media Culture Society|date=January 2000|volume=22|series=Bournemouth University/Large Door Productions|issue=1|pages=25–38|doi=10.1177/016344300022001002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the UK: {{cite web|last=Tryhorn|first=Chris|title=Government thinktank to tackle media convergence issues|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=22 November 2012|date=21 December 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;And for example, in Australia: {{cite web|title=Convergence Review|url=http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Australian Government: Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy|accessdate=23 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121120032/http://www.dbcde.gov.au/digital_economy/convergence_review|archivedate=21 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even the sports stadium of the future will increasingly compete with television viewing "...in terms of comfort, safety and the constant flow of audio-visual information and entertainment available."{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=49}} Other flow on effects of the shift are likely to include those on public architecture such as hospitals and nursing homes, where television, regarded as an essential entertainment service for patients and residents, will need to be replaced by access to the internet. At the same time, the ongoing need for entertainers as "professional engagers" shows the continuity of traditional entertainment.&lt;ref name=Power&gt;{{cite news|last=Power|first=Julie|title=Laughter and music better than drugs for dementia patients|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/laughter-and-music-better-than-drugs-for-dementia-patients-20130802-2r4w9.html|accessdate=3 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=3 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Convergence ===
By the second decade of the 21st century, [[analogue recording]] was being replaced by [[digital recording]] and all forms of electronic entertainment began to [[technological convergence|converge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dwyer|first=Tim|title=Media Convergence|year=2010|publisher=Open University Press McGraw-Hill Education|location=Maidenhead, Berkshire, England and New York|isbn=978-0-335-22873-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, convergence is challenging standard practices in the film industry: whereas "success or failure used to be determined by the first weekend of its run. Today,&amp;nbsp;... a series of exhibition 'windows', such as DVD, pay-per-view, and fibre-optic video-on-demand are used to maximise profits."{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=156}} Part of the industry's adjustment is its release of new commercial product directly via video hosting services. Media convergence is said to be more than technological: the convergence is cultural as well.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|pp=22, 30 ''ff''}} It is also "the result of a deliberate effort to protect the interests of business entities, policy institutions and other groups".&lt;ref name=Tryon/&gt; Globalisation and [[cultural imperialism]] are two of the cultural consequences of convergence.{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=30}} Others include [[fandom]] and interactive storytelling as well as the way that single franchises are distributed through and affect a range of delivery methods.&lt;ref name=Jenkins&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Convergence culture: where old and new media collide|year=2006|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-8147-4281-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "greater diversity in the ways that signals may be received and packaged for the viewer, via terrestrial, satellite or cable television, and of course, via the Internet" also affects entertainment venues, such as sports stadia, which now need to be designed so that both live and remote audiences can interact in increasingly sophisticated ways{{snd}} for example, audiences can "watch highlights, call up statistics", "order tickets and merchandise" and generally "tap into the stadium's resources at any time of the day or night".{{sfnp|Sheard|2001|p=xvi}}

The introduction of television altered the availability, cost, variety and quality of entertainment products for the public and the convergence of online entertainment is having a similar effect. For example, the possibility and popularity of user-generated content, as distinct from commercial product, creates a "networked audience model [that] makes programming obsolete".{{sfnp|Sayre|King|2010|p=536}} Individuals and corporations use [[video hosting service]]s to broadcast content that is equally accepted by the public as legitimate entertainment.

While technology increases demand for entertainment products and offers increased speed of delivery, the forms that make up the content are in themselves, relatively stable. Storytelling, music, theatre, dance and games are recognisably the same as in earlier centuries.

In [[art]] and [[art criticism]], '''form and content''' are considered distinct aspects of a [[work of art]]. The term ''form'' refers to the work's style, techniques and media used, and how the [[Design elements and principles|elements of design]] are implemented. ''Content'', on the other hand, refers to a work's subject matter, or what is being depicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/reference/f/what_is_art.htm|title=How to Define Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hyŏpyul-sa''' (협률사) was the first modern theatre of Korea, supported by the [[Korean Empire]] from 1902 until its closing.&lt;ref name="guy1"&gt;유민영, 『한국근대연극사』. 서울: 단국대학교출판부. 1996. p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1902, [[Korean theatre]] took the forms of outdoor performance and folk theatre. In that year of 1902, the ''Hyŏpyul-sa'' was established as the first modern indoor theatre in Korea, where they staged dramatized stories in [[Pansori]] musical styles. This reformed style of Pansori was a kind of opera or music drama called [[Changgeuk]].&lt;ref name="brandon"&gt;Brandon, James R. and Martin Banham. ''The Cambridge guide to Asian Theatre.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, with strong financial support, it overpowered other private theatres and exercised great influence on other theatres.&lt;ref name="guy1"/&gt; 

As the theatre began to evolve from outdoor to indoor, the style of theatre was also transformed. That change was necessary because the style of outdoor theatre was limited spatially, especially when it came into an enclosed space. As the modern theatre grew, new types of theatre appeared later on.

'''International Sculpture Day''', or IS Day, is a worldwide annual celebration of [[sculpture]] on the last Saturday of April every year. It was established by the [[International Sculpture Center]] and is meant to raise awareness, appreciation and enjoyment of sculpture in communities across the globe. During the inaugural 2015 IS Day, over 50 events were held in 12 countries including Switzerland, China, Germany,
England, Australia, Austria, Canada, Spain, New Zealand, and the USA. In its second year, over 200 events were held in 20+ countries including Australia, Denmark, Poland, Nigeria, Canada, France, Burkina Faso, Bolivia, Croatia and Mexico.

Types of IS Day events include [[Open Studio|open studios]], demonstrations, workshops, public art tours, open museums, brown bag lunches, sculpture scavenger hunts, [[Book signing|book signings]], foundry pours, pop up exhibitions, opening receptions, competitions, artist talks, and more.

'''Kadist''' is an interdisciplinary contemporary arts organization with an international contemporary art collection. In addition to being a collecting body, Kadist hosts artists residencies and produces exhibitions, publications, and public events. The first location was opened in Paris in 2006 by Vincent Worms and Sandra Terdjman, and a San Francisco, California location was added in 2011 in the Mission District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Del Pesco|first=Joseph|title=about page|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kadist-Art-Foundation/105972509425490?id=105972509425490&amp;sk=info|accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

* '''Exhibitions''': With a gallery space both in Paris and San Francisco, Kadist hosts exhibitions by international artists and curators, often in coordination with their residency program. Artists they have worked with include [[Ryan Gander]], [[Danh Vo]], [[Francis Alÿs]], and Roman Ondàk. Additionally they have co-produced large scale artist projects, including "Klau Mich" by [[Dora García]] and "Muster" by [[Clemens von Wedemeyer]] at [[DOCUMENTA (13)]].
* '''Residencies''': Kadist provides residencies for a wide range of creative activities including and not limited to new artistic productions, publications, writers and curators. Recent residents include artists [[Young-Hae Chang Heavy Industries]], bookstore Ooga Booga and publications [[White Fungus (magazine)|White Fungus]], Nero, and [[Fillip]].
* '''Events''': Kadist San Francisco hosts an ongoing series of events,frequently on Wednesdays, which have involved screenings, performances, conversations, and game shows.

==Mission==

From their mission statement: "We believe contemporary artists make an important contribution to a progressive society, their work often addressing key issues of our time. KADIST is a non-profit organization that encourages this engagement and is dedicated to extending the reach of artists represented in its collection to a global audience, thus facilitating new connections across cultures. Its programs develop collaborations with artists, curators and many art organizations around the world. Local programs in KADIST’s hubs of Paris and San Francisco include exhibitions, public events, residencies and educational initiatives. Complemented by an  active online network, they aim at creating vibrant conversations about contemporary art and ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Worms|first=Vincent|title=mission|url=http://kadist.org/about/|publisher=kadist . org|accessdate=29 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==

The Kadist collection was established in 2001 and includes film and video, performance, painting, photography, drawings and prints, sculpture, and installations. Ultimately the collection not bound by geography, but it focuses on four greater regions: the Middle East, Asia, The Americas and Europe. Kadist has also supported the production of artworks, and commissioned artworks through its residency program, and in collaboration with international biennials—some of which are part of the collection.

'''Kenneth Barlow''' is a fictional character from the [[Television in the United Kingdom|British]] [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] soap opera ''[[Coronation Street]]'', played by [[William Roache]]. Ken was created by [[Tony Warren]] as one of ''Coronation Street's'' original characters. He debuted in the soap's first episode on 9 December 1960.&lt;ref name=mark&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrie's Bill will mark half century|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|accessdate=29 April 2011|date=7 November 2008&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaIy3QM?url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having appeared continuously since, December 2010 marked Ken's 50th anniversary on-screen, making Roache the longest-serving actor in a televised soap opera. Roache was honoured at the 2010 [[Guinness World Records]] ceremony for the achievement, when he surpassed actor [[Don Hastings]] from the American soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'', who previously held this title. Roache stated in 2010 that he has no plans to leave the role and will remain in ''Coronation Street'' for as long as they will have him.

Ken was introduced as the educated son of a working-class family. Portrayed as moralistic and a political activist, Ken differed from the other, predominantly working-class characters in the soap opera. The character developed a reputation as a ladies' man; plots saw Ken dating numerous women, marrying four times to three women ([[Valerie Tatlock]] in 1962, [[Janet Reid]] in 1972, [[Deirdre Hunt]] in 1981 and again in 2005), fathering four children with three different women ([[Lawrence Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Lawrence Cunningham]] in 1961 from Ken's affair with [[Susan Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Susan Cunningham]] but he never knew about Lawrence until 2010, Twins in 1965 with [[Susan Barlow]] and [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] from Ken's marriage to [[Valerie Tatlock]], and in 1995 [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]] from Ken's affair with [[Denise Osbourne]]), and adopting Deirdre's daughter ([[Tracy Barlow]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moss|first=John|title=Coronation Street, Granada Television, Manchester|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century|work=Manchester UK|accessdate=29 April 2011|year=2002&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaM6yhS?url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/392569-corries-bill-will-mark-half-century--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the many women Ken has been paired with, his relationship with Deirdre has been the most enduring. Ken and Deirdre's fictional relationship made newspaper headlines in Britain in 1983 due to Deirdre's adultery with [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]]. The storyline captured both media and viewer interest. 20 million people tuned in to watch Ken's discovery of the affair. The storyline lead to a feud between Ken and Mike, prominent in both characters' narratives until Mike's screen death in 2006. In March 2017, ''Coronation Street'' centred a "[[whodunit]]" storyline around the character, where Ken is pushed down the stairs by an unknown assailant, with the storyline being dubbed, "[[Who Attacked Ken?]]". On 26 May 2017, Ken's attacker was revealed as his son, [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]] ([[Rob Mallard]]).

Despite his somewhat antagonistic role in the show's early years, Ken developed a reputation among critics for representing an archetypal "boring man". This is an allegation denied by Roache, who has cited Ken's evolution over the years, his chaotic love life and dysfunctional family as evidence to the contrary. Roache has been honoured with a lifetime achievement award at the [[British Soap Awards]] for his portrayal of Ken. Away from the canonical serial, Ken has been portrayed by [[James Roache]] (William Roache's son) in the dramatisation ''[[The Road to Coronation Street]]'', and by Simon Chadwick in the play ''[[Corrie!]]''. He has also been spoofed by impressionist [[Jon Culshaw]].

==Storylines==
Ken is born and raised in Coronation Street, Weatherfield, [[Lancashire]], on 9 October 1939. He is the eldest son born to [[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank]] (Frank Pemberton) and [[Ida Barlow]] ([[Noel Dyson]]). An intelligent pupil, Ken attends grammar school after passing his [[eleven plus]] exam and in 1957 wins a scholarship at [[Manchester University]]; he lives with his parents and brother [[David Barlow (Coronation Street)|David]] ([[Alan Rothwell]]) in [[Weatherfield]] while studying and gains a [[second class honours]] degree in History and English. Being educated and politically minded, Ken differs from his family and neighbours. This is a source of friction between Ken and his father Frank, who believes Ken is trying to distance himself from his working-class roots. When Ken writes a scathing newspaper article about his uneducated neighbours in Weatherfield, Frank and the community are outraged. In 1961, Ken's mother dies in a motor accident. Ken turns down a teaching post to support his father, but he and Frank continue to clash until Frank leaves in 1964. David and Frank's deaths in 1968 and 1971 respectively, leave Ken as the sole surviving Barlow.

Ken begins teaching, and marries [[Valerie Tatlock]] ([[Anne Reid]]) in July 1962. Two years later, he has a fling with exotic dancer Pip Mistral (Elaine Stevens), but his marriage survives. Twins [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter]] (Robert Heanue) and [[Susan Barlow|Susan]] (Katie Heanneau) are born on 15 April 1965. In January 1966, Ken has another affair with reporter [[Jackie Marsh (Coronation Street)|Jackie Marsh]] (Pamela Craig). Valerie leaves when she finds out, but is later persuaded to return. Ken continues to stand up for his political beliefs, and spends seven days in prison in March 1967, after being arrested for protesting. Ken is left a single-parent following Valerie's untimely death; she perishes after being electrocuted in January 1971, and Ken is left heartbroken. Ken is supported by Valerie's uncle [[Albert Tatlock]] ([[Jack Howarth (actor)|Jack Howarth]]), with whom he shares a close relationship, but caring for the twins proves too difficult and they are sent to live with their grandparents in [[Glasgow]].

Ken has numerous flings, including a one-night stand with [[Rita Littlewood]] ([[Barbara Knox]]), but his next serious relationship occurs in 1973, when Ken marries [[Janet Reid]] ([[Judith Barker]]), in the hope that she will mother his two children. Janet refuses to do this, and in 1974 they separate. Janet flits in and out of Ken's life until 1977, when she kills herself by taking an overdose when Ken turns down a reconciliation.

When [[Ray Langton]] ([[Neville Buswell]]) leaves his wife [[Deirdre Barlow|Deirdre]] ([[Anne Kirkbride]]) in 1978, Ken supports her. In 1981 they marry, with Ken becoming stepfather to Deirdre's four-year-old daughter [[Tracy Barlow|Tracy]] (Christabel Finch). However, by 1983, Deirdre grows bored with Ken and has an affair with his rival, [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]). Ken and Deirdre's marriage suffers; the couple separate in 1990, and eventually divorce following Ken's affair with [[Wendy Crozier]] (Roberta Kerr), his colleague at the local newspaper, ''The Weatherfield Recorder''. Ken takes the separation badly and attempts suicide by overdose, but is prevented from doing so by his friend, [[Bet Lynch]] ([[Julie Goodyear]]).

Ken and Mike, who are the moral opposites of each other, remain enemies; Ken is incensed when his daughter, Susan, falls in love and has a short-lived marriage with Mike. In 1991 Ken and Mike compete for the same woman, [[Alma Sedgewick]] ([[Amanda Barrie]]). When she is dumped by Mike in favour of [[Jackie Ingram]] (Shirin Taylor), she starts seeing Ken. On Christmas Day 1991, Mike lures Alma back into his bed to get back at Ken. Later in 1992, Ken falls for one of his pupil's mothers&amp;nbsp;– Maggie Redman (Jill Kerman). The Baldwin/Barlow feud erupts again, as Mike is the father of Maggie's son, [[Mark Redman (Coronation Street)|Mark]] (Christopher Oakswood). Mike hates the thought of Ken spending Christmas Day with his son, but Ken's pride gets the better of him. He cannot handle the situation, and he and Maggie split.

Ken has a relationship with hairdresser [[Denise Osbourne]] ([[Denise Black]]) in 1994 and fathers her child; their son [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel]] (Lewis Harney) is born in 1995. Denise agrees to marry Ken, but is having an affair with her brother-in-law Brian Dunkley ([[Benny Young]]) at the same time. She leaves Weatherfield in 1996, leaving Daniel with Ken. It is a short-lived custody as, later that year, Denise returns and snatches Daniel; Ken's attempts to reclaim his son fail.

Ken and Deirdre remain close, despite their other relationships. They reunite in 1999, following encouragement from Deidre's mother [[Blanche Hunt|Blanche]] ([[Maggie Jones (actress)|Maggie Jones]]). They eventually remarry on 8 April 2005; although Ken discovers that Deirdre slept with [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) in 2001, he forgives her and they remain together. Deirdre supports Ken in 2002 when he loses his teaching post for assaulting a pupil, Aidan Critchley (Dean Ashton), who has been terrorising him. Marital problems arise in 2006 when, following Mike's death from [[Alzheimer's]], Ken grows jealous of Deirdre's grief reaction; he leaves home and tries to rebuild a relationship with his estranged son Daniel. Daniel's mother Denise, now single, gets the wrong idea and attempts to rekindle a romance with Ken; Ken rebuffs her advances and returns to Deirdre. Ken does stray in 2009, after meeting [[Martha Fraser]] ([[Stephanie Beacham]]). Ken falls in love with Martha, and in May 2009, plans to leave with her. He cannot go through with it, and he jilts her, returning to Deirdre. Eventually he admits to the infidelity. Although Deirdre is angry, she forgives him as he had forgiven her fling with Dev; however, Deirdre later cheats on Ken again, kissing [[Lewis Archer]] ([[Nigel Havers]]). Relations are once again strained between Ken and Deirdre. The couple acknowledge their mutual unhappiness with their marriage, but remain together.

In late August 2010 [[Norris Cole (Coronation Street)|Norris Cole]] ([[Malcolm Hebden]]) discovers an unopened letter addressed to Ken, dating back to the 1960s. The letter is written by Ken's first girlfriend, [[Susan Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Susan Cunningham]] ([[Patricia Shakesby]]), whom Ken had dated in 1960. Susan has a son named [[Lawrence Cunningham (Coronation Street)|Lawrence]] ([[Linus Roache]]), who turns out to be Ken's child. Ken and Lawrence bond, which temporarily threatens Ken's relationship with his other son Peter. When Ken discovers that Lawrence is intolerant of the homosexuality of his own son, [[James Cunningham (Coronation Street)|James]] ([[James Roache]]), Ken severs contact. Realising that he has been unappreciative and neglectful of Peter over the years, he makes an effort to bond, supporting him through his relationship and health problems that follow.

In December 2010, Peter is caught up in the Joinery Bar gas leak explosion, which then resulted in an unforgettable tram crash, as the explosion severed the tramline above. Ken was fearful that his son was going to die and this was almost the case when Peter went into cardiac arrest, after marrying [[Leanne Battersby|Leanne]] on his hospital bed; Peter survived. Ken supported Peter and Leanne as the former struggled to regain a sense of reality, because the explosion left him paralysed, potentially for life. Meanwhile, James comes to stay with the Barlows for a while, with no-one knowing that his rôle in a soup kitchen in town is actually part of a scam. When Ken discovers this, James packs his things and takes off. Ken tried to make him stay but James pushed him out of the way, knocking him unconscious. Ken was not seriously hurt though.

Ken doesn't know where his loyalties lie when Peter is found to be having an affair with [[Carla Connor]] ([[Alison King]]), and he is estranged from son, Simon. Ken is then shocked to discover that Peter has been indicted for the murder of Frank Foster (Andrew Lancel), who had been found not guilty of raping Carla. He tries to help but is pushed away. Eventually it is found that Frank's mother Anne was the real culprit. She is given a custodial sentence, whilst Peter is free to go.

In mid-2013, Ken leaves the street temporarily to look after his grandson Adam in Canada. (a plot devised due to actor William Roache on leave after being arrested). He returns in August 2014 to find his family in chaos. Peter has been imprisoned for the murder of his secret lover [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]) and Tracy is engaged to Carla's despicable brother [[Rob Donovan|Rob]] ([[Marc Baylis]]),

Carla had been pregnant with Peter's baby but had a miscarriage after they separated and Deirdre has fallen apart at the prospect of dealing with all this on her own. Ken is infuriated that Deirdre did not tell him sooner about all this and sets out to clear Peter's name, only to find that the majority of residents on the street, including Simon, believes that Peter did kill Tina. Ken is not sure who to believe anymore. He later discovers that Peter has sacked his lawyer and it becomes even more likely that he will be found guilty of the murder.

Deirdre goes to stay with her [[Bev Unwin|friend]] in October 2014, when it becomes clear the stress of the trial is destroying her. Peter is found guilty of the murder and sentenced to life in prison. However, the verdict is quickly reversed, when it is discovered that it was actually Rob who murdered Tina. Peter is released from prison but makes the decision to leave the street, as he has hardly anything keeping him around, which hurts Simon. Ken tries to make Peter change his mind but he is adamant on leaving, so Ken respects his wishes and sees him off At this point, Deirdre should have come home but called back to say she was staying with Bev a while longer, as one of her relatives had just died.

In July 2015, Deirdre dies and Ken is absolutely devastated by this news. Liz announces Deirdre's passing in the Rovers Return. Deirdre's funeral is held the week after. It is revealed that Deirdre would have been home earlier. However, news of Tracy and Tony's fling reached her and she was ashamed to come home and face Liz. As a result, Ken feels animosity toward Tracy for seemingly stealing Deirdre's last two months from him, when she could have been home when she died.

Ken and Nessa begin dating much to the disapproval of Emily and Rita. Tracy is deeply upset and accuses Ken of betraying Deirdre. Ken kicks Tracy out when he discovers that Tracy has seen her ex–fiancée Rob, who's in prison for murder. In early 2016, Ken dumps Nessa after finding out Nessa had an affair with her sister Cathy's late husband. In October 2016 Ken is shocked to see his son Peter. He accuses Peter of drinking. After their argument, Ken suffers a stroke and he is hospitalised.

In early 2017, Ken's son Daniel is offered a place at [[Oxford University]]. He decides not to go choosing to support his new girlfriend Sinead, who fell pregnant. Ken later turns on Sinead saying she has "trapped Daniel" and blames her for his son not going to university, something that he wishes he had done in 1960. He realized that he had wasted his time being with Deirdre&lt;!--What does this bit mean?! ... than his kids --&gt;, and wishes that he had not married her, but truly loved her more than his other wives, despite her affair with men like Adam's father Mike in 1983. He mentions to Audrey that he has chosen his adoptive daughter Tracy as his favourite, for her mother's true love, over his other children, despite her actions, and wanted to leave her in his will everything. After pushing his family away from him and making Sinead have a secret abortion Ken is pushed down the stairs and left for dead by an unknown assailant. He recovers from his injuries in hospital.

==Creation and development==

===Casting===
[[File:Ken Barlow (1960).jpg|thumb|[[Frank Barlow (Coronation Street)|Frank]] (''left'') and Ken (''right''), in the Barlows' first scene. The juxtaposition of Frank eating in his shirtsleeves, meal smothered in brown sauce, and Ken in a tie, disdainful of the condiment, was used to establish Ken's characterisation as a snob, in conflict with his parents over his rejection of his working-class roots.&lt;ref name="Sauce"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEgan|Egan 2010]], p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Ken Barlow is one of the twenty-two original ''Coronation Street'' characters devised by series creator [[Tony Warren]]. He made his debut in the soap's first episode, broadcast on 9 December 1960. While auditionees for the other twenty-one original roles were drawn from casting director Margaret Morris' contacts in the north of England, Warren spotted William Roache performing in the [[Granada Television]] play ''Marking Time'', and knew that he was the right actor to play Ken.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache almost declined the invitation to audition: "I wasn't interested. I had my flat in London, I was getting acting parts and it all looked very rosy."&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/notw/showbiz/994127/Coronation-Streets-Bill-Roache-50-years-as-Ken-Barlow.html |title=What a Corrie on |work=[[News of the World]] |publisher=[[News International]] |date=26 September 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJafAbeP?url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/notw/public/home/?login%3Dfalse%26url%3Dhttp://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/notw/showbiz/994127/Coronation-Streets-Bill-Roache-50-years-as-Ken-Barlow.html |archivedate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his mind at the insistence of his agent, and attended the audition, at which he was asked to read ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' newspaper in a [[Lancashire accent]]. Roache believes that his indifference towards being cast had a positive impact on his audition, as it enabled him to relax. Two pilot episodes were filmed, with Ken played by Roache in one, and by actor [[Philip Lowrie]] in the other.&lt;ref name="P40"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.40.&lt;/ref&gt; Lowrie was later cast in the role of another original character, [[Dennis Tanner]].&lt;ref name="lowrie"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1406277_coronation_streets_original_bad_boy_dennis_tanner_returns_43_years_on|title=Coronation Street's original bad boy Dennis Tanner returns 43 years on|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=25 January 2011|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaZHUlV?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1406277_coronation_streets_original_bad_boy_dennis_tanner_returns_43_years_on--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roache was initially offered the role of Ken on a thirteen-episode, six-week contract.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bath"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/long-haul/article-2968739-detail/article.html|title=In for the long haul|work=[[Bath Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Northcliffe Media]]|date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=26 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaaneH3?url=http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/news/long-haul/article-2968739-detail/article.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His agent convinced him to take it, as it would enhance his exposure around the broadcast of ''Marking Time''.&lt;ref name="P40"/&gt; ''Coronation Street'' was a hit with viewers and its contract was extended. Roache was given a six-month contract in early 1961, followed by a one-year contract in June of that year, which he deemed amazing security at a time when he had been "leading a hand-to-mouth existence".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.59.&lt;/ref&gt; The series became a long-running soap opera, airing multiple times weekly, and Roache continued in the role, though gradually ceased to affect a Lancashire accent.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.86.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache originally earned ₤10 per episode, compared to the ₤3,000 per episode that he earned in 2010.&lt;ref name=fiftyfacts/&gt; He stated in 2010 that although he initially only intended to feature in ''Coronation Street'' for a short time, once he had filmed it and it was transmitted with "such colossal impact", he realised it was something special.&lt;ref name="thisisnottingham"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramaswamy|first=Chitra|title=It's a wonderful life with Ken Barlow, says Ilkeston's William Roache|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/s-wonderful-life-Ken-Barlow-says-Ilkeston-s-William-Roache/article-2894374-detail/article.html|work=[[Nottingham Post]]|publisher=([[Northcliffe Media]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=15 November 2010&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNl1Iaac?url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/s-wonderful-life-Ken-Barlow-says-Ilkeston-s-William-Roache/article-2894374-detail/article.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Roache needed to be sure it wasn't a mistake to sign up; later he said, "If I had known it would turn out to be my life's work, I would have run a mile."&lt;ref name=fiftyfacts/&gt;

According to writer [[Daran Little]], Roache was partly responsible for the name of the street where the soap is set, ''Coronation Street'', which also serves as the programme's title. The soap was originally titled ''Florizel Street'' when it was commissioned. Roache reportedly could not pronounce Florizel, so the name of the street was changed to ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref name="roadto"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1307060/In-1960-gritty-new-ITV-drama-called-Coronation-Street-aired-7-412-episodes-later-origins-recreated--BBC.html|title=In 1960, a gritty new ITV drama called Coronation Street first aired: 7,412 episodes later its origins have been recreated&amp;nbsp;– on the BBC|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|date=28 October 2010|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJah2gdR?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1307060/In-1960-gritty-new-ITV-drama-called-Coronation-Street-aired-7-412-episodes-later-origins-recreated--BBC.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Longevity===
By 1984, Ken was the only character from the original cast who remained in the serial.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.155.&lt;/ref&gt; He became the only original character to remain with the show continuously into 2010, its 50th year.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Roache has revealed that Ken's role in the serial was threatened in 1964, when producer Tim Aspinall, who was dubbed the "mad axe-man", took the helm of ''Coronation Street''. Aspinall culled a variety of characters from the serial, including fan favourite [[Martha Longhurst]] ([[Lynne Carol]]), and Ken was one of the characters he wished to axe: "He had a kind of hit list of characters. He decided who he wanted out, while others including myself were put on warning that we were likely to be given the chop at a later date. It was appalling," recalls Roache.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; A potential storyline was devised in which Ken and his then wife Valerie would move to Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.76–77.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ken was given a reprieve, as before he could be axed, Aspinall was removed from his position.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

Spiritual enlightenment and a desire for self-improvement led Roache to consider quitting the series in the early 1970s, as he struggled with being in "the most ego-driven profession there is". He ultimately decided to stay—a decision he is happy with in retrospect, as his qualms were never with the series itself, but the way he felt personally.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.92–93.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Roache pledged to stay with ''Coronation Street'': "I'm not even thinking about retiring. It isn't an option and I don't want to even consider it [...] I love the Street and while they want me and while I can do it I want to carry on. I don't care if I'm 120, I'll still be there."&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Roache said in 2010, "When people ask me why I've played the same role for 50 years I try to explain that I haven't because like all human beings, and thanks to clever script-writers, Ken's evolved. He’s been married three times, had 24 girlfriends and is head of a totally dysfunctional family. He has a son [Peter] who's an alcoholic bigamist and a daughter [Tracy] who's a convicted murderer. How many actors get the chance to perform scenes with meaty content like that?"&lt;ref name="MEN"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1345234_william_roache_me_ken_barlow_and_my_friend_emma|title=William Roache: Me, Ken Barlow and my friend Emma|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=9 October 2010 |accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJanSza0?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1345234_william_roache_me_ken_barlow_and_my_friend_emma--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote="Ken has always been very earnest and honourable in his views, and he's tried to do the right thing. The trouble is that like any other human being he is flawed: we all are. When it came to the sort of job he would do, it was clear that teaching fitted perfectly with him as a person. Not only did it help satisfy him intellectually, it also allowed him to help others and at the same time give him a degree of control, which he probably always wanted. I always thought of him during that first decade as a young man who had a very stubborn streak in him when it came to his principles and what he thought was right."
|source=— Roache on Ken's early characterisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tony Warren created Ken as a "[[zeitgeist]]" of modern times in 1960,&lt;ref name="roadto"/&gt; and it has been suggested that Ken is a "prism through which to read the political and cultural history of the last half century".&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/nov/17/coronation-street-ken-barlow-bore|title=In praise of Ken Barlow|first=Joe|last=Moran|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=([[Guardian News and Media]])|date=17 November 2010|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJsPUx8X?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/nov/17/coronation-street-ken-barlow-bore--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the soap's early years, Ken was frequently presented as resenting what he saw as the anti-intellectual, repressed climate around him, and author Dorothy Hobson has suggested that Ken was ashamed of his working-class roots.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDorothy|Hobson 2003]], p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache concurs that Ken obviously had higher aspirations than "being stuck in Coronation Street", but notes that "he was also portrayed as a nice young guy who was happy to help out if he could."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache considers himself "the guardian of Ken", responsible for ensuring that his actions and dialogue remain true to the character. This responsibility lead to a two-year quarrel with his co-star [[Pat Phoenix]], when she insisted that her character, [[Elsie Tanner]], undermine Ken in an argument. Annoyed at Ken being belittled and the scene stripped of its "dramatic impact", Roache rowed with Phoenix, who did not speak to him again—outside of their scenes together—for two years.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' in 2010 stated, "in the beginning Ken was an angry young man who, as a student, was representative of the millions who had benefited from post-war reforms, such as free education for the gifted."&lt;ref name="roadto"/&gt; ''The Guardian''{{'s}} Joe Moran likened Ken to [[Richard Hoggart]]'s scholarship boy "the 'uprooted and anxious' figure whose education had alienated him from his working-class origins."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Moran suggested that Ken has led "what Hoggart once called a 'carousel life', a life not of the upward trajectory of the professional career but of living from year to year and taking whatever job turns up." Moran added that Ken "refused to go along with the last half century's stress on consumer aspiration and meritocratic elitism", but added that by modern standards, "Ken has wasted his education and his life. He has played little part in 'wealth creation' [...] and is still stuck in the same house he lived in when he was a student, leading his carousel life, stoically and decently."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;

Ken's political stance is [[Centre-left|left]]-[[Liberalism|liberal]]. He has been described as the most famous fictional reader of ''[[The Guardian]]'', a newspaper that attracts readers of the mainstream left of British political opinion.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Ken has had several forays into journalism for left-wing publications over the years, and was occasionally shown to be frustrated that his political views were not shared by others.&lt;ref name="left"/&gt; A scathing article he wrote for a newspaper in which he labelled his neighbours as "lazy-minded, politically ignorant, starved of a real culture and prejudiced against any advance in human insight and scientific progress" led to clashes with his father and a fistfight at the [[Rovers Return Inn|Rovers]] with [[Len Fairclough]] ([[Peter Adamson (actor)|Peter Adamson]]).&lt;ref name="left"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_cinema/s/2083764_corries_ken_barlow_takes_a_stroll_down_memory_lane|title=Corrie's Ken Barlow takes a stroll down memory lane|work=[[Reading Post]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=9 December 2010|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJsW0gUo?url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/entertainment/film_and_cinema/s/2083764_corries_ken_barlow_takes_a_stroll_down_memory_lane}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ken has occasionally espoused socialist ideology, Roache suggests that he is really more of a "liberal, fair-minded guy [...] always looking to right the wrongs of society",&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.120.&lt;/ref&gt; and "a man of integrity who fights for what he thinks is right".&lt;ref name="Kay32"&gt;[[#refKay|Kay 1991]], p.32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Graeme Kay discussed Ken's evolution within the show: "He began as a bit of a prig, in the eyes of working-class father Frank, but matured into a sound family man, only to go astray. He changed from teacher to newspaper owner, through various jobs, but threw that away too. He has always liked to see himself as a big fish in a small pond, with his steely, domineering manner and feeling of superior intellect."&lt;ref name="Kay32"/&gt; Little suggested that Ken has transformed from an angry young man who never fitted in and was always challenging the system, into a bore next door, eventually discovering that he couldn't change the world after all. Little dubbed Ken Coronation Street's elder statesman and lynch-pin, a one-man [[Greek tragedy]], and the greatest survivor in Weatherfield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEN+BARLOW+IN+THE+CORONATION+ST+FILES%3a+Angry+Young+Man+who's+turned...-a0125615729|title=Ken Barlow in the Coronation St files: Angry Young Man who's turned into the bore next door.|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Daran|last=Little|date=2 December 2004|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character has a reputation amongst critics as boring and a man of morals; Moran dubbed him the archetypal boring man.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; Chronicling the history of ''Coronation Street'' in 2007, [[Virgin Media]] stated, "Perhaps unfairly dubbed boring, Ken is ultimately an intelligent man, frustrated by the cards life has dealt him&amp;nbsp;– although the hair, clothes and strong morals haven't helped."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/soaps/coronation-street-history2.php|title=Coronation Street: Who's Who?|publisher=[[Virgin Media]]|date=25 January 2007|accessdate=3 June 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJatQAea?url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/soaps/coronation-street-history2.php--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popular perception of Ken as being boring originated, in Roache's view, around the time of the Ken–Deirdre–Mike love triangle storyline. He refutes the label, particularly as Ken has had numerous romantic dalliances during his tenure.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.131.&lt;/ref&gt; Karen Price of the ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' called him the Street's resident intellectual, who has never quite managed to break free from his roots.&lt;ref name="welsh"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/2008/10/04/meet-the-man-behind-corrie-s-ken-barlow-91466-21952303/|title=Meet the man behind Corrie's Ken Barlow|work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Karen|last=Price|date=4 October 2008|accessdate=16 February 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJarFlGN?url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/2008/10/04/meet-the-man-behind-corrie-s-ken-barlow-91466-21952303/--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Ken is renowned for having had multiple relationships with women during his time in ''Coronation Street''. Discussing this, author Hobson has suggested that Ken's numerous relationships could give the impression that the character is a lothario or a great romantic; however, Hobson noted that this would be inaccurate as Ken is "neither a great romantic nor someone with whom you would be wise to trust your romantic or emotional future. In fact, he is one of the characters about whom audiences would tend to want to warn any female characters to 'stay away, it'll end in tears'.&lt;ref name="Hobson129"&gt;[[#refDorothy|Hobson 2003]], p.129.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache feels that Ken's approach to romance early in his tenure belied his educated, intellectual affectations, and revealed him to be a typical "northern working-class man at heart." He explained: "[Ken] was the sort who wanted to have a wife who would stay at home, look after the kids and make sure the house was run smoothly, while he went off to work to pursue a career. It was very old-fashioned in many ways, but he could never see it that way and it was often left to the women he had relationships with to remind him of that trait in his character."&lt;ref name="P107"/&gt;

Ken's many relationships have been marred by infidelities. Despite being generally "well-meaning", Roache assessed that for the first two decades of ''Coronation Street'', Ken had a ruthless streak where women were involved. While he has since mellowed somewhat, he was initially a "sensitive, thinking chauvinist who liked the idea of having a wife who was always there for him, but at the same time [...] found nothing wrong with flirting or going off with another woman."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; ITV publicity noted how many relationships and flings he has had, stating "This could take a while ... Ken has had more girlfriends than most of the Street’s male residents put together."&lt;ref name=stvv&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken Barlow |url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/home/65702-ken-barlow/ |work=[[STV (TV network)|STV]] |publisher=([[STV Group plc]]) |accessdate=2 May 2011 |date=17 December 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223050530/http://entertainment.stv.tv/home/65702-ken-barlow/ |archivedate=23 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the periods of 1960 and 2007, Ken married four times and dated 27 women, including a character played by the then unknown actress [[Joanna Lumley]], who played headmaster's daughter Elaine Perkins in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/55759-retirement-not-an-option-for-bill|title=Retirement 'not an option' for Bill|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|date=4 July 2007|accessdate=16 February 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJb0JR4R?url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/55759-retirement-not-an-option-for-bill--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Valerie Tatlock====
Ken's first notable relationship in the serial was with the character Valerie Tatlock (Anne Reid) in 1961. Roache and Reid had been to neighbouring schools, which gave them common ground and a relaxed attitude to working together.&lt;ref name="P40Little"/&gt; Ken's relationship with Valerie became popular with viewers. Roache once attributed their success to his own rapport with Reid, citing it as a helpful element in their on-screen chemistry. Ken and Valerie married on 4 August 1962. Executive producer [[H. V. Kershaw]] was aware of their popularity, and requested that Granada Television's evening duty officer be made available on the night of broadcast, in order to take phone calls of congratulations from viewers. Although no calls were made, 20&amp;nbsp;million viewers watched the wedding episode. Reid was "thrilled" with the reaction to the wedding. Roache was initially skeptical about the impact marriage would have on Ken's development. Roache said: "I was a sort of young semi-heartthrob in those days and thought getting married was going to finish all that."&lt;ref name="P40Little"&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], pp.40–41.&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that, given Ken's aspirations of upward social mobility and desire to leave Weatherfield, marriage conflicted with his characterisation, but realised it was necessary for the writers to anchor him in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerie gave birth to twins, Peter and Susan, and became a housewife to look after them. All scenes involving the child actors were filmed separately from episodic shoots, to avoid unwanted noise ruining Roache and Reid's scenes. In one storyline, Ken had to start looking after the children more frequently, but he grew bored and would often leave them unattended. Valerie accused him of attempted murder on one occasion when a small house fire occurred&amp;nbsp;– with the twins trapped inside.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], pp.57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; His boredom with his marriage caused him to have an affair with Jackie Marsh (Pamela Craig). There were only "kissing scenes" written into scripts, but the production team made it clear they were having a sexual relationship. The storyline "horrified" viewers, and Craig received abusive letters from angry fans. Craig knew nothing more than a short affair could occur between the pair. On-screen Elsie Tanner convinced him to end the affair; Valerie found out, but forgave him.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], pp.63–64.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache enjoyed the aftermath, as it added a new dimension to Ken, whereby "He was a married man with kids, and had all of those good intentions, but he was also liable to stray and clearly had trouble resisting the temptation of another woman."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken and Valerie's marriage came to an untimely end in 1971. Following Reid's decision to leave the role&amp;nbsp;– having grown bored of playing the character&amp;nbsp;– the producers opted to kill Valerie off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/coronation-street/coronation-street-mikey-north-says-guys-want-date-his-onscreen-mum-and-anne-reid-was-%E2%80%9Cdesperate%E2%80%9D-leave |title=Anne Reid was "desperate" to leave |work=TV Throng |publisher= |date=25 January 2011 |accessdate=29 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723100304/http://www.tvthrong.co.uk/coronation-street/coronation-street-mikey-north-says-guys-want-date-his-onscreen-mum-and-anne-reid-was-%E2%80%9Cdesperate%E2%80%9D-leave |archivedate=23 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reid and Roache were briefly concerned that her departure would result in Ken being written out, and Roache recalls that Ken emigrating with the twins was a scenario under consideration. To his relief, he was kept on.&lt;ref name="VDeath"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.99–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Valerie died after being electrocuted while trying to mend a faulty hair dryer. After the fatal shock, she knocked over an electric heater, setting the Barlow's house on fire; it has been dubbed one of the most sensational soap departures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-94316/Sensational-soap-departures.html|title=Sensational soap departures|first=Isobel|last=Fox|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNkO3f1c?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-94316/Sensational-soap-departures.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A then-record audience tuned in for Valerie's death, scripted by [[Leslie Duxbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/10325/leslie-duxbury|title=Leslie Duxbury|first=Patrick|last=Newley|work=[[The Stage]]|publisher=The Stage Newspaper Ltd|date=7 November 2005|accessdate=29 April 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNkb65IN?url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/10325/leslie-duxbury--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following episode ended with Ken walking through the burned remains of their home, in a scene that Roache has deemed one of his "most enjoyable and satisfying moments in ''Coronation Street''."&lt;ref name="VDeath"/&gt;

====Janet Reid====

|quote="Janet clearly saw Ken as someone who might provide the sort of lifestyle she wanted if he was pushed and manoeuvred in the right direction. She had plans for them to move away from the Street and into a bigger house, and went along with the idea Ken had of getting the twins back to live with them, while all along having no intention of sharing a home with his kids. it soon became clear that the marriage was not going to be a happy one, and Janet was no Val."
|source=— Roache, on Ken and Janet's relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Ken's second marriage in the serial was to a character named Janet Reid (Judith Barker) in 1973; their relationship was short-lived.&lt;ref name="barlows"/&gt; There was no buildup to their marriage; Ken returned from Scotland and introduced Janet as his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson |first=Anne |title=Corrie's Best Characters: No 2&amp;nbsp;– Ken Barlow |url=http://www.aoltv.co.uk/2010/12/09/corries-best-characters-no-2-ken-barlow/ |work=[[AOL]] |accessdate=8 May 2011 |date=9 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yXB1Ud0v?url=http://www.aoltv.co.uk/2010/12/09/corries-best-characters-no-2-ken-barlow/ |archivedate= 8 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline's fast pace angered Roache; he once stressed: "I was very cross about the whole thing. There was no wedding, she just arrived, no build-up to it. It was just like an idea that was shoved in. I wasn't happy."&lt;ref name=lill/&gt; The storyline was unpopular with viewers, who did not approve of the wedding. Janet was already an unpopular character by then, because of her previous affairs with two other ''Coronation Street'' males. Barker said Janet was often perceived as treating Ken unfairly. She openly showed her dislike for his children and sent them to boarding school. The situation saw Ken realise he was in a "loveless marriage"&amp;nbsp;– a match made whilst feeling lonely and under the presumption that she was his last chance of happiness. The breakdown of their marriage was accompanied by what Little dubbed "a series of spectacular rows", which saw Ken become violent towards Janet.&lt;ref name=lill&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], p.116.&lt;/ref&gt; One such row, which followed Ken's discovery of Janet's plans to send the twins to boarding school, was later used as an exercise in drama schools, which Roache deemed "a nice compliment to everyone involved in creating the moment."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Janet and Ken split up in 1974. Barker was included in the series on and off for a few years, as Janet would occasionally return to be with Ken. In late 1976 Barker was asked to reprise the role for a final time. Janet returned on-screen in 1977 and asked Ken for another chance, claiming she had changed. When he rejects her, she commits suicide by taking an overdose. Barker recalled the "exhausting" scenes she and Roache filmed, and said there was substantial "dramatic [[Tracking shot|tracking]]" scenes as Ken discovered her dead in bed. Ken was described as "shattered" and "remorseful" by the death of Janet, and felt guilty over the fact he did not try to help her more. To worsen his situation, he was initially suspected of murdering her.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], pp.137–138.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deirdre Hunt====
In 1972, Deirdre Hunt, played by Anne Kirkbride, was introduced into ''Coronation Street''; the character would become synonymous with Ken's narrative when, in the early 1980s, Deirdre became Ken's third wife.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; A combined audience of 24 million viewers tuned in to see the nuptials.&lt;ref name="barlowwedding"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8179978/50-years-of-Corrie.html|title=50 years of Corrie|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group|first=Harry|last=Wallop|date=4 December 2010|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNovlQOj?url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8179978/50-years-of-Corrie.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wedding coincided with professional unease for actor Roache, who feared that Ken was becoming boring, to the detriment of his own self-confidence.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; In 2010 Roache said, "[Ken] was beginning to look very ordinary and quite nerdy, and that in turn had a knock-on effect for me, because I started to lose confidence as an actor. I went through a time where I was really scared of 'drying', which is not being able to remember your lines. You start to wonder about your own ability to remember lines and act in the way you had, which can be very damaging."&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

Roache inferred that the writers no longer knew how to utilise Ken. Although he had rarely done so in the past, he voiced his concerns to the series' producer, dismayed that the character "seemed to be floating in a nebulous state". He believes that Ken was thereafter included in "much stronger stuff" as a result, including a storyline in which Deirdre had an affair with his rival, Mike Baldwin (Briggs).&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline was devised in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.129.&lt;/ref&gt; Then producer Mervyn Watson recalls: "It was normal story conference and we looked at the Ken/Deirdre marriage and had the idea of her having an affair with somebody in the Street. It was extremely passionately debated because there were categorical and opposite view points expressed."&lt;ref name=watson/&gt; Watson believes that actors often feel "disturbed and uncomfortable" at the prospect of what their character will experience. In turn, he thought the scenario generated some of the best performances in the actors' careers. He concluded that Roache proved his theory correct, and praised his performance.&lt;ref name=watson&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], p.165.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box |width=20% |align=right |bgcolor=#cccfff |quote="The now famous 'love triangle showdown' scene on the doorstep on No.1 will always be my favourite.

A now infamous scene, in which Ken comes face-to-face with Mike following the discovery of the affair and a showdown ensues, was originally scripted differently. Ken was intended to stand and meekly watch Mike and Deirdre chatting on his doorstep.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Roache disliked this version, as he believed Ken's response lacked realism. Partly fuelled by his previous frustration with Ken's "lame" characterisation, Roache approached the episode's director, [[Brian Mills (television director)|Brian Mills]], and requested that Ken be allowed to hit Mike. Though the filming set-up planned for the scene did not allow for this, it was agreed that Ken would attempt to hit Mike, and that Deirdre would intervene.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.22–24&lt;/ref&gt; In the transmitted scene, Deirdre did intervene, resulting in Ken attempting to manhandle her. Roache recalls, "Every time I looked at the words and at what was supposed to happen I knew it just didn't ring true. Poor Annie wasn't prepared for what happened to her next and actually burst into tears because of the ferocity of my performance. She was shaken up by it, and when it came to the moment for Mike Baldwin to knock at the door she got an even bigger shock. After Baldwin asked why Deirdre had put the phone down when he'd called earlier, I slammed the door shut with my left hand and then slammed poor Annie against the door itself, leaving her shaken and shocked. She then made her way into the Barlows' living room, sobbing her heart out, and Brian left the cameras rolling, capturing [Anne's] genuine distress."&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;

The storyline was described as the most volatile and explosive in the programme's history.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Roache recalls viewers taking it very seriously, to the point that he received letters reading: "Dear Ken, I though you should know that Mike Baldwin is seeing your wife!"&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.130&lt;/ref&gt; He related that, "When Deirdre decided to stop seeing Mike and stay with Ken, the scoreboard at [[Old Trafford]] on the night flashed the message that the couple were not splitting up to 56,000 football fans, amid thunderous cheers from the crowd!"&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; 20&amp;nbsp;million viewers tuned in for the episode; it attained the soap's second-highest recorded overnight ratings, surpassed only by the farewell episode of [[Hilda Ogden]] ([[Jean Alexander]]) in 1987.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1334594_coronation_street_50_years_50_fascinating_facts_from_weatherfield|title=Coronation Street 50 Years: 50 fascinating facts from Weatherfield|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNozhhjM?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1334594_coronation_street_50_years_50_fascinating_facts_from_weatherfield}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken and Deidre have been described as soap opera's version of [[Richard Burton]] and [[Elizabeth Taylor]].&lt;ref name="barlows"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline=the-barlows---and-highs--&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19030600&amp;siteid=66633-name_page.html|title=The Barlows ..and highs|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Brian|last=Mciver|date=2 May 2007|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNp5OwKw?url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline%3Dthe-barlows---and-highs--%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D19030600%26siteid%3D66633-name_page.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship has featured various affairs, break-ups and reunions over the years. The couple's first marriage eventually disintegrated in the early 1990s, this time when Ken had an affair with colleague Wendy Crozier, a dalliance which ended in divorce for the Barlows. Ken was kicked out of home on New Year's Day 1990.&lt;ref name="barlows"/&gt; Their on/off relationship continued, with each having various other liaisons, until producers decided to reunite Ken and Deidre in 1999.&lt;ref name="barlows"/&gt; Roache said, "I was pleased.

They had both gone off and done very silly things and had had affairs with people, and yet their overriding need as they got older was for each other."&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; Ken and Deirdre's second marriage in 2005 was watched by an estimated 13 million viewers, compared to the nine million who watched the wedding of [[Prince Charles]] to [[Camilla Parker Bowles]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/apr/21/television.tvandradioarts1|title=Soap bubbles|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|first=Sarah|last=Ellis|date=21 April 2008|accessdate=3 June 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaPbwTP?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/apr/21/television.tvandradioarts1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, Ken and Deirdre's first wedding in 1981 was screened within 48 hours of Prince Charles and [[Princess Diana]]'s wedding, and just as in 2005, the Barlow wedding attracted more viewers than the royal wedding.&lt;ref name="barlowwedding"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=/2005/4/7/features/10599213&amp;sec=features |title=Double wedding in Britain |work=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |publisher=Star Publications |first=Choi |last=Tuck Wo |date=7 April 2005 |accessdate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017222430/http://thestar.com.my/lifestyle/story.asp?file=%2F2005%2F4%2F7%2Ffeatures%2F10599213&amp;sec=features |archivedate=17 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roache has been complimentary about Ken and Deirdre, as well as Kirkbride—who, he states, he loves as much as Ken loves Deirdre—with this love explaining why Ken always ends up returning to her. Roache said, "We have been together on screen for pretty much 30 years now and so much of what we do on camera is instinctive. We really are like an old married couple who have had their ups and downs, lived through them and come out the other side."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a290831/bill-roache-praises-lovely-kirkbride.html|title=Bill Roache praises "lovely" Kirkbride|first=Ryan|last=Love|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=1 December 2010|accessdate=2 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNpCC1Xu?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a290831/bill-roache-praises-lovely-kirkbride.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denise Osbourne====
Ken was paired romantically with hairdresser [[Denise Osbourne]] ([[Denise Black]]) in 1994, the romance scuppering the chances of a reconciliation between recent divorcees Ken and Deirdre. Scriptwriters had actually been planning to reunite Ken and Deirdre, but when Deirdre's actress fell ill and had to be written out, the scripts were changed and Ken was paired with Denise instead.&lt;ref name="denise"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fans+stop+me+and+say+'You're+that+cow+Denise+from+the+Street'...+then...-a061157239|title=Fans stop me and say 'You're that cow Denise from the Street'|first=Jules|last=Stenson|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=4 February 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black has suggested that the romance came out of nowhere.&lt;ref name="denise"/&gt;

''The Official Coronation Street Annual 1997'' has described Ken and Denise as a "mis-matched pair" who were never destined to spend their lives together.&lt;ref name="Sharp"/&gt; In the storyline, Ken fathered Denise's son Daniel. They had an on/off relationship and a wedding was planned in 1996; however, in a plot twist, it was revealed to Ken that Denise, unable to  "hold her primitive lusts in check", was having an affair with her brother-in-law, Brian.&lt;ref name="sundaymail"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Street+of+tears+as+Ken+loses+in+love+...-a061255016|title=Street of tears as Ken loses in love|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=7 January 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon the discovery, Ken's happiness was snatched away in what has been described by ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' as "harrowing circumstances", and one of the character's worst moments.&lt;ref name="sundaymail"/&gt; Denise Black has discussed her character's ambivalence towards her relationship with Ken, revealing why she believed Denise engaged in infidelity: "The thing is that she's in love with both men. When she's with Brian she loves him. And she's completely in love with Ken when he's with her. So she has two loves and all the guilt that goes along with that scenario. Denise doesn't mean to cause so much pain. Her problem is that she just doesn't know whether she's coming or going."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Record+Woman%3b+I+didn't+aim+to+hurt+Ken.-a061286232|title=Record Woman; I didn't aim to hurt Ken|first=John|last=Millar|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=17 January 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Ken discovered the truth the wedding was called off, with Ken telling Denise to "get out before I kill you".&lt;ref name="denise"/&gt;

Following the revelation and amidst the fallout, Denise absconded, leaving her son in Ken's custody. This facilitated Black's desire to have a six-month break from the serial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/JILTED+KEN+IN+LOVE-TUG+BATTLE.-a061177153|title=Jilted Ken in love-tug battle|first=Paul|last=Byrne|work=[[The People]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=7 January 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character returned in the winter of 1996, for the last part of her storyline, Black having decided to quit the role. Denise's return storyline was scripted to coincide with ''Coronation Street''{{'}}s increase to four weekly episodes. It focused upon a custody battle for Daniel between Ken and Denise after Denise snatched Daniel. A source at the time discussed the storyline and Ken's reaction to losing his son: "Ken is devastated when he returns home the week before Christmas and finds his son gone. He simply can't believe he's been snatched by the woman who dumped them. He immediately starts a custody battle. Denise plays heavily on the fact that she is the mother, while Ken [claims] that he is back in a relationship with his ex-wife Deirdre. Deirdre actually goes to court with him for support, but she gets angry when she finds out he tries to use their friendship as a lever to get Daniel back."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/KEN'S+IN+TROUBLE+AGAIN...IT+MUST+BE+CHRISTMAS.-a061159089|title=Ken's in trouble again...It must be Christmas|first=Brian|last=Roberts|work=[[Sunday Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|date=29 September 1996|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Denise was awarded custody, she left ''Coronation Street'', and Ken lost contact with his son.

Denise was reintroduced for several months in 2007, over a decade after she had last appeared. Ken tracked down his son following marital unease with Deirdre, which led to interactions with Denise when he turned up unannounced for a visit. Black was pleased to be invited back, saying "I don’t think that you can have Ken Barlow’s baby and forget about it, can you?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/interviews/a46010/denise-black.html|title=Denise Black|first=Kris|last=Green|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|date=2 May 2007|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNpK8iZL?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/interviews/a46010/denise-black.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Denise's return was used as a catalyst to cause further problems in Ken and Deirdre's marriage, Ken having grown discontented. It was only a brief return; once Denise's advances towards Ken were rejected, Denise was written out again. Denise briefly returned in 2017 as part of [[Who Attacked Ken?]] as Daniel was the attacker.

====Martha Fraser====
In January 2009, [[Martha Fraser]] (played by [[Stephanie Beacham]]), a new love interest for Ken, was introduced to the show.&lt;ref name="DSMF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a136922/stephanie-beacham-joins-corrie.html%7Clast=Green%7Cfirst=Kris|title=Stephanie Beacham joins Corrie|date=27 November 2008|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJaWKgaj?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a136922/stephanie-beacham-joins-corrie.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken meets Martha by the canal while he is walking his dog, Eccles.

He enjoys telling Martha about his problems, his son and his grandchildren, as she is not judgmental.&lt;ref name="KenCheatAgain"/&gt; When asked if Ken mentions Deirdre, Roache said "Er... no. Martha asks him about Peter's mum and Ken tells her that she's dead, which is the truth, so Martha automatically assumes he's a widower and he doesn't put her right."&lt;ref name="KenCheatAgain"/&gt; Ken also chooses not to mention Martha to Deirdre; Roache believed that she would be angry if she found out.&lt;ref name="KenCheatAgain"/&gt; Roache revealed that Ken is not thinking about having an affair with Martha, but he is "captivated" by her, and does have feelings for her.&lt;ref name="KenCheatAgain"/&gt; During the storyline, Roache's wife, Sara, died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/manchester/7877711.stm|title=Street actor Roache's wife dies|date=8 February 2009|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache was given compassionate leave from the soap, and writers were forced to rework Ken's storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1139225/Corrie-bosses-reschedule-filming-widowed-William-Roache-time-needs-mourn-wife.html|title=Corrie bosses reschedule filming to give widowed William Roache 'all the time he needs' to mourn wife|last=Drake|first=Matthew|date=10 February 2009|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken and Martha eventually consummate their relationship, and Ken considers leaving Deirdre and Weatherfield.

Alison Graham of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' said Martha was Ken's soulmate, because "she's the most perfectly bourgeois bit-on-the-side."&lt;ref name="RTKandM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/586-what-were-watching-ken-and-martha-in-coronation-street/ |title=Ken and Martha in Coronation Street |last=Graham |first=Alison |date=13 March 2009 |work=[[Radio Times]] |publisher=[[BBC Magazines]] |accessdate=4 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yQcsB5q1?url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blogs/586-what-were-watching-ken-and-martha-in-coronation-street/ |archivedate= 4 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham said that Martha allowed Ken's "middle-class heart" to sing after the pair bonded over a love of [[BBC Radio 4]], books and plays.&lt;ref name="RTKandM"/&gt; Comparing Ken's relationships with Martha and Deirdre to a prison sentence, Graham said Martha offered Ken a deserving parole from the "years of breaking rocks in the prison yard of his marriage to Deirdre."&lt;ref name="RTKandM"/&gt; She hoped that Ken and Martha were "soon in the throes of ecstasy", because Ken deserved it.&lt;ref name="RTKandM"/&gt; Following the conclusion to Ken's relationship with Martha, Roache expressed an interest in having more girlfriends for Ken introduced in the future.&lt;ref name="MoreLoveTwists"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a214502/roache-wants-more-corrie-love-twists.html|title=Roache wants more Corrie love twists|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=15 April 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor said, "I thought it was great last year having a girlfriend, especially at my age. A few more would be great. I've lost count of romances I've had in the show, not to mention the four weddings."&lt;ref name="MoreLoveTwists"/&gt; Ken and Martha's romance was later depicted in the ''Coronation Street'' musical, ''[[Corrie!]]''. Ben East of ''[[The Stage]]'' said the romance was "genuinely funny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/review.php/29294/corrie-|title=Corrie!|last=East|first=Ben|date=17 August 2010|work=[[The Stage]]|publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited|accessdate=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other relationships====
Ken's first on-screen relationship was with Susan Cunningham (Shakesby), whom he dated throughout the first ten episodes. Ashamed of his family and background, Ken was constantly apologising to her. This frustrated Susan, who actually liked Coronation Street.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; Fifty years later, it transpired that their relationship had left Susan pregnant, resulting in the birth of a son, Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.list.co.uk/article/28837-bill-roaches-family-dream/|title=Bill Roache's family dream|date=24 August 2010|work=[[The List (magazine)|The List]]|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Susan, Ken's early love interests included [[Marian Lund]] (Patricia Heneghan), a librarian eleven years his senior; Yvonne Chappell (Alex Marshall), a hotel receptionist he met en route to first wife Valerie's funeral; [[Norma Ford]] ([[Diana Davies (actress)|Diana Davies]]), an impressionable young shop-assistant;&lt;ref name="P118"/&gt; Wendy Nightingale (Susan Tebbs), a married woman who moved in with Ken, making them ''Coronation Street''{{'}}s first unmarried cohabiting couple;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEgan|Egan 2010]], pp.138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; and Elaine.&lt;ref name="P118"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.118–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Roache believes that Ken was in love with Elaine, though her feelings for him were less intense. He recalls some discussion of re-introducing her to the series in 2009; however, this did not come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.121.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon separating from Elaine, Ken confided in his friend Rita (Knox) that, "There were other fellers more glamorous, more successful, more wealthy and more interesting than me." According to Roache, the line offers insight into Ken's psyche, evidencing that he truly belongs on Coronation Street, despite his desires to the contrary.&lt;ref name="P122"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.122.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the number of romances Ken was involved in declined from the 1980s onwards, Roache states that those relationships he did have "tended to be bigger and more involved".&lt;ref name="P122"/&gt; His later love interests included Wendy Crozier (Kerr), Alma Sedgewick (Barrie) and Maggie Redman (Kerman).&lt;ref name="P118"/&gt;

===Family===
[[File:Chris Gascoyne.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Chris Gascoyne plays Ken's son Peter Barlow]]Ken was disdainful of his parents, Frank (Pemberton) and Ida (Dyson).&lt;ref name="P15"/&gt; Their strained familial relationship was apparent from his very first scene, in which conflict arose over his reluctance to eat a meal with brown sauce. Roache called it "good character-defining stuff", which established the antagonism between Ken and his father, borne from Ken's snobbery and desire to abandon his roots.&lt;ref name="Sauce"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.53.&lt;/ref&gt; The death of his mother further illuminated the father-son relationship. Roache recalls that, "although their relationship could often be stormy, with Ken's views and attitude rubbing Frank up the wrong way on a number of issues, the fact was that they had been thrown together by her death and they had to get used to living with each other without the buffer that Ida had often provided."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; While Dyson left the series under her own volition, Pemberton later became one of several cast members fired under Aspinall's tenure as producer. By 1984, both of Ken's parents had left the Street.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.75–78.&lt;/ref&gt; Ken was originally intended to have a sister named Enid. Warren decided against her inclusion, and instead created a younger brother, professional footballer David (Rothwell),&lt;ref name="fiftyfacts"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oglethorpe|first=Tim|title=Coronation Street: 124 deaths (including 16 murders), 86 marriages, 52 barmaids&amp;nbsp;– 'ey oop chuck, it's 50 years of Corrie|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1308570/Coronation-Street-50th-birthday-124-deaths-86-marriages-52-barmaids.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|accessdate=8 May 2011|date=3 September 2010&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yXEaEoCe?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1308570/Coronation-Street-50th-birthday-124-deaths-86-marriages-52-barmaids.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; to enable the show to represent teenage males.&lt;ref name="P15"&gt;[[#refEgan|Egan 2010]], pp.15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; Rothwell feels that an "underlying antagonism" existed between Ken and David, which stemmed from the fact Ken had the advantage of a university education, while his brother did not.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEgan|Egan 2010]], p.25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken was bored with looking after the children, Peter and Susan, before Valerie's death. Afterwards, further problems occurred and Ken was no longer able to cope.&lt;ref name=scotsman/&gt; The writers were initially uncertain whether to continue with Ken as a single father, or dispatch the children and pursue a less-encumbered lifestyle.&lt;ref name="P107"&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.107&lt;/ref&gt; Roache said, "Ken tried to bring up the kids on his own, but he wasn't doing so good. So he sent them up to Glasgow to live with his mother-in-law." Ken still remained in contact; Roache recalled Ken often saying: "Right, I'm off to Scotland.'"&lt;ref name="scotsman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ramaswamy|first=Chitra|title=Interview: Coronation Street's Ken Barlow, aka William Roache|url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment/Interview-Coronation-Streets-Ken-Barlow.6650744.jp?articlepage=2|work=[[The Scotsman]]|publisher=([[Johnston Press]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=7 December 2010&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yKdDL8AM?url=http://news.scotsman.com/entertainment/Interview-Coronation-Streets-Ken-Barlow.6650744.jp?articlepage%3D2--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache has suggested that the subsequent problems in his children's adulthood were Ken's fault: "I blame Ken for how they've all turned out. He shoved his kids up in Scotland, didn't really look after them. But you don't want a happy family in the Street. You want a wonderful dysfunctional one like the one I've got, they're great and Deirdre is wonderful."&lt;ref name="thisisnottingham"/&gt; The animosity between Ken and his children has been explored throughout the programme's duration. [[Chris Gascoyne]], who took on the role of Peter in the 2000s, has suggested that there is a lot of tension between Ken and Peter due to the dysfunctional nature of the Barlow family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peter Barlow a bad dad?

Their close relationship resulted in Roache challenging the series producers when a script required Ken to allow Daniel to be taken away by his mother. The actor felt that Ken would not accept this; he would fight. The scriptwriters apologised, but it was too late to re-write the plot.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.189–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Valerie's death, Ken became responsible for looking after her uncle, Albert, and he later became known as Ken's "Uncle Albert".&lt;ref name=uncc&gt;{{cite web|title=Holland's Pies create Coronation Street-themed products|url=http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/7985140.Holland_s_Pies_create_Coronation_Street_themed_products/|work=Chorley Citizen|publisher=([[Newsquest]])|accessdate=8 May 2011|date=5 April 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yWnWjnsx?url=http://www.blackburncitizen.co.uk/news/7985140.Holland_s_Pies_create_Coronation_Street_themed_products/|dead-url=no|archivedate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert would often make attempts to interfere in Ken's life, as he had no one else. At one stage, Ken was making plans to leave Weatherfield. When Albert revealed he could not pay his bills on his pension, Ken opted to stay. The storyline has been called a turning point for Ken—when he realised he belonged in ''Coronation Street'' and had to help the community and Albert alike.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLittle|Little 1995]], p.130.&lt;/ref&gt; Ken moved in with him and Albert gradually saw Ken as "the son he never had".&lt;ref name=vmeds&gt;{{cite web|title=The original Coronation Street cast|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/top-tv-shows/coronation-street/original-corrie-cast.php?ssid=4|work=[[Virgin Media]]|accessdate=8 May 2011|year=2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yWt5KHRR?url=http://www.virginmedia.com/tvradio/top-tv-shows/coronation-street/original-corrie-cast.php?ssid%3D4|dead-url=no|archivedate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache enjoyed the opportunity to work closely with Howarth, whom he first met as a schoolboy.

Lawrence was a bigot who could not accept that the fact James was homosexual. The producers decided to run the storyline to highlight the fact homophobia still exists. Gay rights activists approved of the storyline because the producers showed both sides of the issue. On-screen, Ken was opposed to Lawrence's views and decided to embrace James' sexuality.

===Feud with Mike Baldwin===
Television researcher Helena Robson has discussed the appeal of soap operas and suggested that "many soap stories are never finally resolved and conflicts between characters may run throughout the programme's history". She used the "undying hatred" between Ken Barlow and Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs) as an example of this, suggesting that viewers "welcome the sense of stability this offers although the element of change offers as much enjoyment for viewers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why are soap operas so popular? |url=http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Students/hlr9501.html |first=Helena |last=Robson |work=[[Daily Mail]] |publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]]) |accessdate=30 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316142905/http://www.aber.ac.uk/media/Students/hlr9501.html |archivedate=16 March 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested in an ITV documentary in 2006 that Ken and Mike's hatred was a clash of cultures: "Barlow the lefty do-gooder versus Baldwin, the cut-and-thrust money grabber."&lt;ref name="farewell"&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Farewell Mike| serieslink =Coronation Street| credits =| network = ITV| airdate = 7 April 2006| time = 20:00}}&lt;/ref&gt; Briggs has claimed that Ken was jealous of Mike because he was rich and successful while Ken was not, and Roache has claimed that the reason Ken disliked Mike was because he was a self-centred and self-made individual.&lt;ref name="farewell"/&gt;

[[File:Old Trafford inside 20060726 1.jpg|thumb|The [[Old Trafford]] football ground. During the Ken-Mike-Deirdre love triangle in 1983, fans watching the match were informed that Deirdre was staying with Ken. The scoreboard flashed "Ken 1, Mike 0".]]
Ken's feud with Mike—spanning over 20 years—began in 1983, when Ken discovered that his wife, Deirdre, was having an affair with Baldwin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baldwin to die in arms of Street rival|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-377734/Baldwin-die-arms-Street-rival.html|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=20 February 2006&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPCUW6iO?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-377734/Baldwin-die-arms-Street-rival.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His dislike for Mike pre-dated the affair, however, and Roache has stated:

{{quote|text="The truth was that Ken never liked him, but having his wife go off and have an affair with Mike turned dislike into hatred, which was wonderful for the programme. Just the mention of Baldwin's name was enough to get Ken twitching with barely contained anger, and for Johnny Briggs and me it was absolutely wonderful. At best the two characters sometimes tolerated each other in an uneasy truce, but at worst the two of them not only threw insults at each other, but punches too. It was a relationship that ran for many years, and although towards the end of Mike Baldwin's time on the show you might say there was a little mellowing going on, it was never a relationship that was going to be anything other than uneasy."|sign=William Roache|source=''50 Years on the Street''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.135.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of the love triangle storyline, Briggs has said, "the way it captured the nation was amazing. Everyone was talking about it and the pubs were empty. Men were shouting out: 'Go on Mike, give her one.' People were disappointed when she went back to Ken".&lt;ref name="feud"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mike's top 20 moments|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16846346&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=66633&amp;headline=mike-s-top-20-moments--name_page.html|first=Claire|last=Donnelly|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=22 March 2006|archiveurl=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MIKE%27S+TOP+20+MOMENTS%3B+EXCLUSIVE%3A+DAY+THREE+OF+THE+JOHNNY+BRIGGS...-a0143508294|archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storyline had significant cultural impact, with the press claiming that the country was divided between those who thought Deirdre should remain with Ken, and those who thought she should leave with Mike.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refC4|Hobson 2008]], p.46.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2003 book, Hobson suggested that Ken "spent at least nineteen years unable to cope with the sense of rejection and betrayal" caused by Mike and Deirdre's affair.&lt;ref name="Hobson129"/&gt;

Scriptwriters capitalised on the rivalry between the characters when, in 1986, Mike married Ken's daughter Susan, a union that Ken strongly opposed.&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt; Numerous fights between Ken and Mike were featured, and Briggs has suggested that they became famous for their brawls. The first fight between the pair occurred in 1986, when Ken confronted Mike in his factory about Mike's maltreatment of his daughter.&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt; Of the confrontation, Briggs has said, "It was a classic&amp;nbsp;– Baldwin getting it in his own territory, the factory. It took a lot to get Ken angry but after the way Mike had treated his daughter, he was furious. He marched into the office and let him have it. This was one of those rare times he caught Mike off-guard."&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt; Mike was shown to get revenge on Ken, though it took a further four years before he could do so on-screen. In a scene which aired in 1990, Mike punched Ken, knocking him over a table in the Rovers Return public house.&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt; Briggs has suggested that he and Roache became old hands at doing on-screen fistfights, and that both really enjoyed doing the stunts. According to Briggs, no choreographers were ever used. In 1998 one incident left Briggs with an injury after he fell backwards.&lt;ref name="feud"/&gt;

Ken and Mike were forced to work together in 2000, when they were featured in a storyline dubbed the "Freshco siege".&lt;ref name="siege"&gt;{{cite web|title=Street siege's soul survivors.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/LAST+NIGHT'S+VIEW+%3a+Street+siege's+soul+survivors.-a066000093|first=Claire|last=Donnelly|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=12 October 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken and Mike were among several series regulars held up at gunpoint in the soap's local supermarket, where Ken had been working as a trolley pusher. The episode was broadcast after the 9 pm watershed due to its depiction of violence. Ken and Mike were bound together by armed robbers, which facilitated an end to their feud; Ken helped Mike to combat a [[panic attack]].&lt;ref name="siege"/&gt; The pair resolved to put the past behind them; it was a temporary reprieve. Mike had unknowingly fathered a son, Adam, during his brief marriage to Susan Barlow; she kept the baby a secret from him. Mike discovered Adam's existence in 2001; Susan attempted to flee, but was killed in a motor accident. Then followed a battle between Mike and Ken for custody of Adam, with Ken adamant that Mike should not look after his grandson. The storyline lead to the fifth fistfight between Ken and Mike in the soap's history, with the pair brawling at the funeral of Susan.&lt;ref name="adam"&gt;{{cite web|title=CUSTODY STREET; Ken and Mike fight for orphan Adam.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CUSTODY+STREET%3b+Ken+and+Mike+fight+for+orphan+Adam.-a069369899|first=Claire|last=Donnelly|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=30 April 2011|date=22 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feud came to an end on-screen in 2006, when Briggs quit the role of Mike. Mike was killed off, dying of [[Alzheimer's disease]]; he died in Ken's arms. In the final scenes, a disorientated and dying Mike was found wandering the streets by Ken, and as Ken cradled Mike in his arms, the rivals talked about old times before Mike died, signifying the end of their 20-year feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baldwin to die in arms of Street rival|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/205062_baldwin_to_die_in_arms_of_street_rival|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=20 February 2006|accessdate=22 April 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPbAHkmJ?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/205062_baldwin_to_die_in_arms_of_street_rival|dead-url=no|archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote Mike's final scenes, ''[[Radio Times]]'' released a series of photographs with Ken and Mike re-enacting [[Arthur William Devis|Arthur Devis]]'s (1807) [[The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805|painting]] of the death of [[Horatio Nelson]]—Baldwin was shown surrounded by his nearest and dearest during his final moments, with Ken prominently positioned next to him, taking on the role of [[Captain Hardy]], Nelson's trusted colleague to whom Nelson famously uttered "Kiss me" before he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kiss me Barlow|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-381255/Kiss-Barlow.html|first=Tom|last=Bryant|work=[[Daily Mail]]|publisher=([[Associated Newspapers]])|date=28 March 2006|accessdate=22 April 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPb5Liae?url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-381255/Kiss-Barlow.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer Maire Tracey said, "The fact that Mike dies in Ken's arms says it all. For most of Mike's life, it was his battles with Ken that kept him going. Like two cowboys, they spent their lives sizing each other up. Behind the scenes Bill Roache has even suggested to Johnny Briggs that they should make a version of ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'' for the two elderly cowboys. Both Ken and Mike will miss the bust-ups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Johnny's long goodbye to Mike Baldwin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Johnny's+long+goodbye+to+Mike+Baldwin%3b+Television+IT'S+bye-bye+Johnny...-a0143950729|first=Marion|last=McMullen|work=[[Coventry Evening Telegraph]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=1 April 2006|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reflecting on the feud in 2006, Roache gave reasons why he thinks Ken and Mike clashed so often: "Ken felt threatened when Mike arrived on the street, but it made the part more exciting for Bill. Ken is a nice guy, a loyal guy, a reliable guy. But he isn't terribly exciting. So the exciting guy [Mike] comes along and he's a bit flash, isn't he? But I've always liked the physical side of acting, so my punch-ups with Johnny were probably the best bits. I shall miss those terribly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drama: Bald truth as Street's stars reveal all|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/DRAMA%3a+Bald+truth+as+Street's+stars+reveal+all...+NEW!+FAREWELL+MIKE...-a0143937139|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=1 April 2006|accessdate=22 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Who Attacked Ken?}}
In March 2017, Ken was at the centre of a "[[whodunit]]" storyline which saw an unknown assailant push him down the stairs of his house after striking him over the head with a blunt object.

Harvey therefore tried to shape the play around their journeys over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coronation Street writer Jonathan Harvey on new play Corrie |url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/leisure/stage/8811583.INTERVIEW__Coronation_Street_writer_Jonathan_Harvey_on_new_play_Corrie_/ |work=News Shopper |accessdate=14 February 2011 |date=25 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328201420/http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/leisure/stage/8811583.INTERVIEW__Coronation_Street_writer_Jonathan_Harvey_on_new_play_Corrie_/ |archivedate=28 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011 Ken was among various ''Coronation Street'' characters to have his portrait auctioned for charity in the exhibition 'Behind the Street' at Manchester's Generation Pop Gallery. The black-and-white shots were taken by photographer Rob Evans, and raised £8,600 for charity. The highest bid on a photograph was for a shot of Ken, standing amongst rubble after the Weatherfield tram crash in 2010, a storyline marking the show's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a304699/corrie-portraits-go-under-the-hammer.html|title=Corrie portraits go under the hammer|date=19 February 2011|first=Sophie|last=Hines|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=2 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNpWkH6z?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a304699/corrie-portraits-go-under-the-hammer.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 ITV began selling ''Coronation Street'' merchandise featuring Ken, including gift wrap&lt;ref name=shop&gt;{{cite web|title=Coronation Street Character Gift Wrap&amp;nbsp;– ITV Store |url=http://shop.itv.com/detail.php?p=275840 |work=[[itv.com]] |publisher=([[ITV Plc]]) |accessdate=2 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719190356/http://shop.itv.com/detail.php?p=275840 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and novelty congratulations cards.&lt;ref name=shopper&gt;{{cite web|title=Ken &amp; Deidre' Congratulations Novelty Card&amp;nbsp;– Coronation Street&amp;nbsp;– ITV Store |url=http://shop.itv.com/detail.php?p=275810 |work=[[itv.com]] |publisher=([[ITV Plc]]) |accessdate=2 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719190430/http://shop.itv.com/detail.php?p=275810 |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A parody song written about the character, entitled "Ken!", was included on [[Harry Hill]]'s debut album, ''[[Funny Times (Harry Hill album)|Funny Times]]''. The track features vocals from Hill and Roache.&lt;ref name="harryhill"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roache records song with Harry Hill|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2010/09/27/roache-records-song-with-harry-hill-115875-22591703/|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=29 April 2011|date=27 September 2010&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJZil18E?url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2010/09/27/roache-records-song-with-harry-hill-115875-22591703/--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken has been spoofed by [[Jon Culshaw]] in ''[[The Impressions Show]]'', where he is having a secret affair with [[Pat Evans (EastEnders)|Pat Evans]] from ''[[EastEnders]]'', spoofed by [[Debra Stephenson]]. Culshaw wanted to include his impression of Ken in the show, saying "We were just looking for an excuse to get him in", so he decided that Ken and Pat would have a "secret romantic tryst at a motorway service station" somewhere between Weatherfield and the ''EastEnders''{{'}} setting of [[Walford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://holysoap.channel5.com/coronationstreet/news/big-impression-of-ken-and-pat-10933?tab_block_3=0 |title=Big Impression of Ken and Pat |date=20 November 2010 |work=[[Holy Soap]] |publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] |accessdate=2 May 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yNpd7GPX?url=http://holysoap.channel5.com/coronationstreet/news/big-impression-of-ken-and-pat-10933?tab_block_3=0 |archivedate= 2 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, [[Trisha Ward]]'s stage musical, ''[[Street of Dreams (musical)|Street of Dreams]]'', debuted. The production, which is based on ''Coronation Street'', featured Roache playing his on-screen alias, Ken, in a pre-recorded segment. Roache was one of several actors from the television series to feature in the musical. Others included [[Julie Goodyear]], [[Kevin Kennedy (actor)|Kevin Kennedy]] and [[Brian Capron]] (who played [[Bet Gilroy]], [[Curly Watts]] and [[Richard Hillman]] respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17845108|title=Stage set for Coronation St musical Street of Dreams|date=2 May 2012|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
For his portrayal of Ken, Roache won the Lifetime Achievement award at [[British Soap Awards#1999 winners|The British Soap Awards 1999]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/coronation-street/william-roache-plays-ken-barlow-3609633|title=William Roache plays Ken Barlow|work=[[Television New Zealand|TVNZ.co.nz]]|publisher=[[Television New Zealand]]|accessdate=8 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yXDM0mrO?url=http://tvnz.co.nz/coronation-street/william-roache-plays-ken-barlow-3609633--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, Ken surpassed [[Bob Hughes]] ([[Don Hastings]]) from US soap opera ''[[As the World Turns]]'' to become the longest-serving soap opera actor. Roache was honoured at a [[Guinness World Records]] ceremony in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/3184045/Ken-Barlows-world-record.html |title=Ken Barlow’s world record |work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |publisher=[[News International]] |first=Colin |last=Robertson |date=18 October 2010 |accessdate=1 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112194134/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/soaps/3184045/Ken-Barlows-world-record.html |archivedate=12 November 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, Roache, Kirkbride and Briggs were named TV Personalities of the Year at the Pye Colour Television Awards, for their performances in the Ken–Deirdre–Mike love triangle storyline.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Brian Viner]] of ''[[The Independent]]'' has suggested that Roache has not been given the accolades he has deserved as a performer because of his longevity in the role of Ken. He felt that it may be a common assumption that Roache is merely playing himself on-screen; this notion diminishes a "rather remarkable acting performance". He added, "although the bouquets tend to go to actors who repeatedly display their versatility, it is in many ways even harder to inhabit one role for five decades. That said, for sheer staying power Ken and Bill are clearly indivisible: one has lived in the same street practically all his life, the other in the same role [...]. That we have been able to watch the evolution of that young man into the Ken Barlow we know today, no less self-righteous but with 50 years of experiences behind him, is frankly one of the wonders of British television."&lt;ref name="indepen"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/william-roache-the-role-of-a-lifetime-2150841.html|title=William Roache: The role of a lifetime|work=[[The Independent]]|date=4 December 2010|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ken has a reputation for being boring.&lt;ref name="indepen"/&gt; The British band [[Half Man Half Biscuit]] highlighted this point in their 2001 song "Lark Descending", comparing Ken Barlow infavourably with a member of the US underground music scene, with the lyric: "I could have been like [[Lou Barlow]], but I'm more like Ken Barlow".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes| title = Editor's recommendation| others = Half Man Half Biscuit| year = 2001| type= CD| publisher   = Probeplus | id = PP32CD| location = UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Ken being fictional, critic [[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]] writing for the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' in 2009 labelled Ken "the most boring man you could ever meet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-199512466.html|title=Boring Barlow's pulling power is beyond our Ken.|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|first=Jim|last=Shelley|date=11 May 2009|accessdate=1 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache sued for libel in 1990 when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper ran an article branding Ken boring and making allegations that Roache was disliked among the cast of ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/apr/14/features11.g2?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Bankrupt... but by no means boring|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|first= Fiachra|last=Gibbons|date=14 April 1999|accessdate=1 May 2011&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yMXwNXjY?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1999/apr/14/features11.g2?INTCMP%3DSRCH}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roache said to the jury at the court case, "I felt extremely distressed. I could not believe those words had been written, that they had raked into my past. I broke out in a sweat. [...] They were saying that I was not doing my job, that I was a joke to the storyline writers, which is not true". Roache added in regard to Ken, "If people find someone who has had 23 girlfriends and three wives boring, that's fine by me."&lt;ref name="trial"/&gt; Roache won the case and was awarded £50,000; however, he was forced to pay legal costs, which bankrupted him.&lt;ref name="trial"/&gt; Brian Viner has suggested that it is remarkable that Ken has been labelled boring in spite of the many plots he has been involved with over the years. Brian Viner said, "It is easy enough to see, despite the extraordinary number of broken relationships and personal crises in his wake, why Ken tends not to make the pulse race when he opens his mouth. After all, he usually opens it only to drink halves of bitter, or to say something sensible or worthy. For 50 years he has been the nearest thing Weatherfield, the fictional area of Greater Manchester where Coronation Street is located, has had to a social conscience."&lt;ref name="indepen"/&gt;

In a [[Channel 4]] televised poll that was broadcast in 2001, Ken Barlow was voted the third most-hated TV character of all time, coming behind [[Phil Mitchell]] from ''EastEnders'' and [[Mr Blobby]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|url=http://www.classictv.info/survey/characters/| title = 100 Greatest TV Characters | accessdate =3 May 2011| series = 100 Greatest/100 Worst | serieslink = 100 Greatest/100 Worst | network = [[Channel 4]]| airdate =2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a ''[[Radio Times]]'' poll of over 5,000 people in 2004, 15% chose Ken as the soap character they would most like to see retired. He came second in the poll, behind ''EastEnders''' [[Den Watts]] (17%).&lt;ref name="retiredpoll"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/123/123791_hilda_ogden_voted_the_best.html|title=Hilda Ogden voted the best|work=[[Manchester Evening News]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|date=13 July 2004|accessdate=10 September 2007|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yPD9r7sx?url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/news/s/123/123791_hilda_ogden_voted_the_best.html|dead-url=no|archivedate=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Television personality [[Paul O'Grady]] wrote the foreword to Roache's 2010 autobiography, ''50 Years on the Street''. In it, he hailed Ken as "one of the iconic British soap characters", an all-time great who has been integral to ''Coronation Street''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMyLife|Roache 2010]], pp.11–13&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Grace Dent]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested that ''Coronation Street'' archetypes have influenced latter soap opera characters. On Ken, she stated: "another heavily plagiarised ''Corrie'' stalwart is Ken Barlow, who as 'resident intellectual' has been looking down his nose at the proletariat since 1960. Just like poor hangdog-faced Ken, brainy people in soapland ([[Anthony Trueman|Dr Truman]] [from ''[[EastEnders]]''], [[Roy Cropper]], [[Todd Grimshaw]] [both from ''Coronation Street''], ''[[Emmerdale]]'s'' [[Ethan Blake|Ethan]] the curate) are always miserable and brooding, due to the terrible burden of their mighty intellect in the face of so many simpletons. It rarely pays to be too clever or too rich in soapland as the majority of plotlines rely upon tragic Shakespearian falls from grace which everyone laughs their socks off at."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2005/jul/30/tvandradio.theguide|title=Crowned with glory|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|first=Grace|last=Dent|date=30 July 2005|accessdate=3 June 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yMYC4Y0r?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/jul/30/tvandradio.theguide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, viewers complained to ITV as well as the media regulator [[Ofcom]] after ''Coronation Street'' broadcast scenes in which Ken made derogatory comments about [[Christianity]]. A spokesperson for the show defended the opinions expressed by Ken in the scripts, saying, "''Coronation Street'' is a soap opera set in modern society and therefore represents views from all side of the religious spectrum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a152724/corrie-kens-remarks-spark-complaints.html|title=Corrie Ken's remarks spark complaints|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=14 April 2009|accessdate=3 June 2009&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJbAvxZA?url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a152724/corrie-kens-remarks-spark-complaints.html--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' columnist [[Nancy Banks-Smith]] spoke highly of Ken's affair with Martha Fraser in 2009, calling it "a muted ingenious storyline".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/may/09/last-nights-tv-coronation-street|title=Last night's TV: Coronation Street|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|first=Nancy|last=Banks-Smith|date=9 May 2009|accessdate=29 September 2010&lt;!--archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yJbCakOA?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2009/may/09/last-nights-tv-coronation-street--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gareth McLean of the ''[[Radio Times]]'' was critical of the storyline: "When it comes to self-delusion, Ken takes the biscuit, claims the cake and wolfs down the éclair. Nursing the notion that he's been thwarted by life, he decides to leave Deirdre to sail off into the sunset&amp;nbsp;– or possibly Runcorn&amp;nbsp;– with Martha.

The spider was showcased in [[Liverpool]], [[England]], as part of the 2008 [[European Capital of Culture]] celebrations, travelling around the city between 3-7 September.&lt;ref name=Times&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/visual_arts/article4666717.ece|title= Huge mechanical spider to attack Liverpool|publisher=The Times Online|accessdate=2008-09-05 | location=London | first=Jenny | last=Booth | date=2008-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, it was on display in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]], as part of Yokohama's 150th anniversary of its port opening.&lt;ref name=JapanTimes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fa20090424a1.html|title=La Machine invades Yokohama!|accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arts reviewer Lyn Gardner wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' "There were times when it seemed to be leading the entire population of the city on a merry dance, like some kind of arachnid [[The Pied Piper of Hamelin|pied piper]]."&lt;ref name="Guardian2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/sep/08/theatre.europeancapitalofculture2008|title=La Machine Liverpool City Centre|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=2008-09-08|accessdate=2008-09-08|publisher=The Guardian|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spider was designed by La Machine's [[François Delarozière]], who also designed the mechanical elephant and the giant girl for [[Royal de Luxe]]'s performance of [[The Sultan's Elephant]] which visited London in May 2006.&lt;ref name=L08&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpool08.com/streets/LaMachine/index.asp|title=La Machine|publisher=Liverpool European Capital of Culture|accessdate=2008-09-09|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107125503/http://www.liverpool08.com/streets/LaMachine/index.asp|archivedate=2009-01-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PHF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phf.org.uk/page.asp?id=188|title=Paul Hamlyn Foundation Artichoke Trust L'araignée by La Machine £50,000|publisher=Paul Hamlyn Foundation|accessdate=2008-09-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080912215720/http://www.phf.org.uk/page.asp?id=188|archivedate=2008-09-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Both projects were brought to the UK by the company and charitable trust [[Artichoke (creative company)|Artichoke]].&lt;ref name=Arti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artichoke.uk.com/liverpool2008.htm|title= Liverpool 2008|publisher=Artichoke|accessdate=2008-09-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516081814/http://www.artichoke.uk.com/liverpool2008.htm |archivedate=2008-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The spider was built in [[Nantes]] in France, using steel and [[Populus|poplar]] wood and complex [[hydraulics]], and took an entire year to construct.

==Performance and narrative==

[[File:La Princesse on move1 2.jpg|thumb|La Princesse moving through the streets of Liverpool|alt=]]

The performance artists of La Machine created a story about the spider with one member of the company playing scientist Joseph Browning who gave interviews to the press. The spider was followed by a full live band, housed in their own platforms on top of [[Forklift|fortlift trucks]] and [[Aerial work platform|cherry pickers]]. The musicians played specially composed music by [[Dominique Malan]], the special effects were designed by [[Thierry Loridant]] and the costumes were designed by [[Gaelle Choveau]].&lt;ref name="LM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamachine.co.uk/|title=La Machine Home Introduction|publisher=La Machine|accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First appearance ===
On Wednesday 3 September the spider appeared for the first time on the side of [[Concourse House]], a derelict tower block in Lime Street, which had been designed by architect [[Richard Seifert]] and was scheduled for demolition.&lt;ref name="AJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/dailynews/2008/09/giant_spider_arrives_in_liverpool.html|title=Giant spider arrives in Liverpool|publisher=Architects Journal|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 'The journey begins' ===
On the morning of Friday 5 September, the spider moved to the [[Albert Dock]], and it became active at lunchtime, moving in a small area and spraying the public with water. In the evening the spider travelled from the Albert Dock to the [[Cunard Building]], via [[Salthouse Dock]]. A huge crowd turned out despite the heavy rain. The performance move around the [[The Royal Albert Dock Liverpool|Albert Dock]] and proceeded onto The Strand. The moving cordon of stewards surrounded the spider as it moved through the crowd. The spider sprayed water onto the crowds and interacted with members of the public. It then turned off the Strand and back into the Albert Dock. Here it paused and was lifted from its traction body by a huge crane and into Salthouse Dock, where it was sprayed (along with the crowd) by huge water cannons. After its 'bath' it returned to its traction body and walked along The Strand to its resting place for the night next to the [[Royal Liver Building|Royal]] [[Royal Liver Building|Liver Building]]. 

=== 'City centre rampage' ===
On Saturday 6 September the spider was due to travel through the streets of Liverpool, 'walking' from the [[Cunard Building]] via Water Street, Castle St, Lord St, Parker St and Ranelagh Place back up to Concourse House. At 2:30&amp;nbsp;pm the Performance started with the spider ‘awakening’ and starting to walk up [[Water Street, Liverpool|Water Street]] towards the city centre. Liverpool was crowded with its usual Saturday afternoon shopping crowd and the tens of thousands who had turned out to see the spider. The spider ‘walked’ through the middle of the Saturday shopping crowd, up through the city centre's streets, and right into the heart of the city's shopping district. The crowd was dispersed by the moving cordon around the spider. Local media reported that the scene was more representative of a victory parade of a football team or the crowds attracted by the Beatles to the city centre in their heyday.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} One bride could not get through the crowds to her wedding at the Town Hall and had to be helped through the crowd on foot by the police. The spider's musicians played an impromptu wedding march as they fought through the crowd.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Various set pieces took place along the spider's route, involving smoke, fireworks and water cannon. The spider worked its way towards the main shopping area, passing [[Liverpool One]]. When the spider reached the centre of [[Lord Street, Liverpool|Lord Street]], it was covered by a snow shower from above to make it go to sleep. It came to a rest at around 5&amp;nbsp;pm, taking a break before its further exploits that evening.

=== 'The city fights back' ===
The next chapter of the story continued the same day and involved the city ‘fighting back’ and attempting to halt the path of the invading spider. At 7:30&amp;nbsp;pm the spider ‘awoke’ and continued to move up the main shopping street, Church Street. When it reached the top of the street it was met by a barrage of flame cannons. These consisted of long copper pipes, fired with high pressure gas. The heat and noise produced by this halted the spider in its tracks, while a mechanical digger moved in to attempt to fell the beast. The spider then changed its path to escape this and moved upwards towards [[Lime Street, Liverpool|Lime Street]]. Upon reaching Lime Street the spider was met by huge fans, which blew air to attempted to hold it back. The performance continued onwards towards Lime Street Station and the empty Concourse Tower, where it had first been sighted on Wednesday. A further barrage of flames stopped the spider from moving on any further and it turned towards the station. Cranes then moved in to lift it from its traction body and, with operators still on board, it started to moved into a vertical position. The spider then moved from one crane to another and amazingly attached itself to the side of the tower. A snow shower then engulfed the spider and it went to sleep for the evening.

=== 'The creature departs' ===
On Sunday 7 September a large crowd of spectators went to the Concourse House to see it climb back down the building. The spider then crawled down the streets of Liverpool city centre, spraying the crowd with water. The spider then moved across St Georges Plateau amongst a huge crowd and down towards the [[Queensway Tunnel]]. Fireworks erupted from surrounding buildings as it passed. Watched by tens of thousands of people, it investigated the area outside the Queensway Tunnel's entrance, setting off huge water cannons and flames around the area, followed by hundreds of fireworks which detonated above the spider and the public. The spider then turned to face the crowd and moved backwards as it disappeared in a cloud of smoke into the tunnel entrance.
==Cost==

[[File:La Princesse on move2.jpg|thumb|Showing the puppeteers: three ride on top of the spider and nine under her body, one to operate each leg and one for other operations|alt=]]

The project, which was free to the public, cost between £1.8 and £1.9 million to stage, of which £1.5 million came from the Liverpool Culture Company (in turn funded by the city, the Arts Council and the [[Department of Culture, Media and Sport]]).&lt;ref name=LE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/liverpool-entertainment/echo-entertainment/2008/09/08/farewell-to-1-8m-la-machine-show-as-spider-crawls-away-100252-21702105/2/|title= Farewell to £1.8m La Machine show as spider crawls away|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost of the project has been defended by [[Phil Redmond]], who is responsible for the performance as Liverpool Culture Company's artistic director.  He said "At £1.5m I think it's actually cheaper than (booking) Macca ([[Paul McCartney|Sir Paul McCartney]]) and it has got us on the front of the [[South China Morning Post]]. So it's good value for money."&lt;ref name=BBC2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/merseyside/7599960.stm|title= Thousands watch spider 'wake up' |publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-09-05 | date=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the project has come in for criticism in some quarters: the UK mental health charity [[Anxiety (mental health charity)|Anxiety]] has highlighted the potentially traumatic effect of the production upon those suffering with [[arachnophobia]],"&lt;ref name=LDP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/liverpool-news/regional-news/2008/09/05/la-machine-nightmare-for-all-arachnophobics-64375-21679200/|title= La Machine: Nightmare for all arachnophobics|publisher=Liverpool Daily Post|accessdate=2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[TaxPayers' Alliance]] has called the artwork an "outrageous waste of taxpayers' money".&lt;ref name=MOS/&gt; The vast majority of the public response was positive, however, with most of the belief that "The Liverpool Princesse's" performance was the highlight of the city's Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations. On 8 September, ''[[BBC North West Tonight]]'', a regional news programme, revealed that plans were afoot to secure La Princesse to stay permanently in Liverpool, and talks had already been held with La Machine. 

Although the event was free to the public, there has been a shortfall of between £300,000 and £400,000 in funding for the project, exacerbated by the falling exchange rate with the [[Euro]], the currency in which the French participants are paid. Artichoke has appealed for donations to help fund the project.&lt;ref name=LE/&gt;&lt;ref name=LM2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamachine.co.uk/index.php/help/|title= Help|publisher=La Machine|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justgiving.com/artichoketrust|title= Artichoke Trust|publisher=Just Giving|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">[[Image:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry aout.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration from [[Très riches heures du Duc de Berry]], 1412-16, by Pol and Hermann de Limbourg, representing the month of August and depicting, in the foreground, the Nobility riding out to hunt with falcons while in the midground, the harvest takes place and the workers cool off in the river. One of the Duc's many castles, Étampes, completes the scene. Illumination on vellum, 22,5 x 13,6 cm]]
The term '''Labours of the Months''' refers to cycles in [[Medieval art|Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance art]] depicting in twelve scenes the rural activities that commonly took place in the months of the year.  They are often linked to the signs of the [[Zodiac]], and are seen as humankind's response to God's ordering of the Universe. 

The Labours of the Months are frequently found as part of large sculptural schemes on churches, and in [[illuminated manuscripts]], especially in the Calendars of late medieval [[Book of Hours|Books of Hours]].  The manuscripts are important for the development of [[landscape painting]], containing most of the first painting where this was given prominence. The most famous cycle is that painted in the early 15th century by [[Limbourg Brothers|Hermann, Pol and Johan de Limbourg]] in [[Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]. In the 16th century, late in the history of the theme, [[Simon Bening]] produced especially fine cycles which link the Limbourgs with the landscape paintings of [[Peter Breughel the Elder]].

==Typical cycle==
The contents of cycles varied with date, location, and the purpose of the work. The [[Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] &lt;small&gt;(illustrated right)&lt;/small&gt; was designed for the personal use of a great magnate, and was unusually large, allowing all the typical elements to be used in many months. It combines astrological and calendar information at the top, with a combination of the agricultural life of the peasant, the life of the elite courtiers, and illustrations of the Duke's many castles in the background of several scenes.   

A typical simple scheme was:&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Robert G. ''Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages'', mp 246, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

*January - Feasting
*February - Sitting by the fire
*March - Pruning trees, or digging
*April - Planting, enjoying the country or picking flowers
*May - Hawking, courtly love
*June - Hay harvest
*July - Wheat harvest
*August - Wheat threshing
*September - Grape harvest
*October - Ploughing or sowing
*November - Gathering acorns for pigs
*December - Killing pigs, baking

- but there were many variations, especially in major wine-growing areas, where more wine related scenes were included.  Italian cycles often advance the agricultural scenes a month earlier than ones from the [[Low countries]] or England.  The impact of the onset of the [[Little Ice Age]] has been detected in differences between early and late examples.

==Sculpture cycles==
[[Image:Perugia - Fontana Maggiore - 1 - Mesi - 09 - Settembre - Foto G. Dall'Orto 5 ago 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|The Month of September from the Fontana Maggiore in [[Perugia]] (c. 1275), by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, shows the treading of grapes.]] 
Most sculptured cycles in Europe, especially when compressed into the [[archivolt]] of a portal, consist of an astrological symbol beside, above or incorporated in a sculpture or relief illustrating a monthly labour.

A few sculpted examples of the many surviving are: 
* [[Chartres cathedral]]: west and north portal archivolts. Window, see below
* [[Notre Dame, Paris]]: northern doorjambs of the west facade (Portal of the Virgin), and a stained glass Zodiacs, labours, vices and virtues cycle filling the west rose window
* [[Abbey of la Madaleine, Vézelay|Vezelay Abbey]]: Archivolt of main west basilica doorway
* [[Autun Cathedral]]: Archivolt of main west cathedral doorway
* [[Ferrara Cathedral]]
* [[Saint Mark's, Venice]]: main portal
* [[San Zeno di Verona]]: facade
* [[Lucca Cathedral]]:  large bas-relief panels with little Zodial signs, to the right and left of the main facade door
* [[Fontana Maggiore]], [[Perugia]]: relief panels showing monthly labours are amongst those surrounding the lower basin of the great  fountain in front of the Duomo.
* [[Otranto Cathedral]]: Zodiac signs and labours form part of the mosaic scenes which cover the entire floor.
* [[Canterbury Cathedral]]: Zodiac signs and monthly labours are amongst the subjects illustrated in large inlaid marble floor medallions on the edge of the Trinity Chapel close to where the shrine of Saint Thomas (Becket) was located.
* [[St Augustine's Church, Brookland]], Kent: large cylindrical lead font with reliefs of both Zodiac signs and monthly labours - a rare example in the UK both of such a font and of the combination of zodiac signs and monthly labours.
* [[Carlisle Cathedral]]: the foliate capitals of the twelve piers of the choir each contain a figure representing one of the labours of the months.

==Stained glass==
[[Image:Chartres_cathedral_041_Seasons_Dec_Jan_Feb.JPG|thumb|250px|Chartres Cathedral, the months of December, January and February]]
The Labours of the months often occur in those [[rose window]]s that are dedicated to the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]], the circular nature of the window suiting the cyclic theme. In these windows, the months are part of a complex iconographical scheme. Other windows have the Labours of the Months specifically as their subject matter.

'''''Le bonheur de vivre''''' (''The Joy of Life'') is a painting by [[Henri Matisse]]. Along with [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Les Demoiselles d'Avignon]]'', ''Le bonheur de vivre'' is regarded as one of the pillars of early [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="Barnes"&gt;[http://www.barnesfoundation.org/about/press/coverage/matisse-mystery Martha Lucy, ''Matisse Mystery'', the Barnes Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; The monumental canvas was first exhibited at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] of 1906, where its cadmium colors and spatial distortions caused a public expression of protest and outrage.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;

==Description==
In the central background of the piece is a group of figures that is similar to the group depicted in his painting ''[[The Dance (second version)|The Dance]]'' (1909–10). In the picture, there are several nude bodies of women and men in a landscape drenched with vivid color.

==Inspiration==
"The work is known to have invigorated fellow artists, especially [[Pablo Picasso]], who, in an effort to outdo Matisse in terms of shock value, immediately began work on his watershed ''Les Demoiselles D’Avignon''", writes Martha Lucy, associate curator at the Barnes Foundation.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;

James B. Cuno and Thomas Puttfarken suggest that the inspiration for the work was [[Agostino Carracci]]'s engraving of [[:image:Agostino Carracci - Reciproco Amore or Love in the Golden Age.jpg|''Reciproco Amore'' or ''Love in the Golden Age'']] after the [[:image:Pauwels Franck - "Amori"- Reciproco amore (Etá dell'oro).jpg|similarly named painting]] by the 16th-century Flemish painter [[Paolo Fiammingo]].  Based on the many similarities with the engraving, in particular its theme of pastoral fantasy and its  composition with the circle of dancers in the background, Cuno came to the conclusion that Carracci's engraving had a decisive influence on the final composition of ''Le Bonheur de Vivre''.&lt;ref&gt;James B. Cuno, ''Matisse and Agostino Carracci: A Source for the Bonheur de Vivre'', The Burlington Magazine, Vol. 122, No. 928, Special Issue Devoted to Twentieth Century Art (Jul., 1980), pp. 503–505&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/880685?uid=3739832&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;uid=3739256&amp;sid=21104402109737 Thomas Puttfarken, ''Mutual Love and Golden Age: Matisse and ‘gli Amori de’ Carracci''], ''Burlington Magazine'' 124 (Apr. 1982): 203–208.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/271 Andrew Graham-Dixon, The Dance by Henri Matisse] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809003307/http://www.andrewgrahamdixon.com/archive/readArticle/271 |date=2014-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Hilton Kramer]] ''Le bonheur de vivre'', owing to its long sequestration in the collection of the [[Barnes Foundation]] which never permitted its reproduction in color, is the least familiar of modern masterpieces. Yet this painting was Matisse's own response to the hostility his work had met with in the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1905, a response that entrenched his art even more deeply in the esthetic principles that had governed his [[Fauvist]] paintings which had caused a furor and which did so on a far grander scale, too."&lt;ref&gt;[[Hilton Kramer|Kramer, Hilton]], ''The Triumph of Modernism'': The Art World, 1985–2005, 2006, ''Reflections on Matisse,'' p. 162. {{ISBN|0-15-666370-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The "sequestration" Kramer referred to relates to the very limited hours of the museum, when its collection was located in suburban [[Merion]], [[Pennsylvania]]; in 2012, the collection was moved to a new, more accessible facility in downtown [[Philadelphia]].)

==Conservation==
''Le bonheur de vivre'' features a large amount of cadmium sulfide-based yellow. Portions of the painting containing cadmium sulfide are turning white or brown, degrading the work. [[University of Delaware]] Prof. Robert L. Opila, in collaboration with Barbara Buckley, head of conservation at the Barnes, and Jennifer Mass, a senior scientist and head of the Scientific Research and Analysis Laboratory at Winterthur, studied the paint’s material microstructure in an attempt to determine why the cadmium sulfide is changing color.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDaily"&gt;[http://www.udel.edu/udaily/2012/dec/opila-matisse-barnes-122011.html UDaily, ''Matisse Mystery, Materials science reveals clues about pigment degrading on painting'', University of Delaware, Dec. 20, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

“It is a very disheartening phenomenon, considering the painting’s position in history,” says Opila, professor of materials science at UD.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDaily" /&gt;

Preliminary tests carried out by UD doctoral student Jonathan Church at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble, France, show that carbon dioxide is reacting with the cadmium sulfide, causing the formation of cadmium carbonate, which is white. Also, the presence of chloride in the paint appears to be acting as a catalyst for the deterioration. Opila and his research team theorize that the binder, an oil similar to linseed oil, may be turning brown.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDaily" /&gt;

“The scientific studies being undertaken will contribute significantly to the preservation of the painting and to our understanding of the change that has taken place to the visual appearance of the painting,” says Buckley.&lt;ref name="Barnes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UDaily" /&gt;

In the mid-6th century, the introduction of [[Buddhism]] from Korea ([[Baekje]]) to Japan resulted in a revival of [[Japanese sculpture]]. Buddhist monks, artisans and scholars settled around the capital in [[Yamato Province]] (present day [[Nara Prefecture]]) and passed their techniques to native craftsmen. Consequently, early Japanese sculptures from the [[Asuka period|Asuka]] and [[Hakuhō period|Hakuhō]] periods show strong influences of continental art, which initially were characterized by almond-shaped eyes, upward-turned crescent-shaped lips and symmetrically arranged folds in the clothing. The workshop of the Japanese sculptor [[Tori Busshi]], who was strongly influenced by the [[Northern Wei]] style, produced works which exemplify such characteristics. The [[Shaka Nyorai|Shakyamuni]] triad and the Guze [[Guanyin|Kannon]] at [[Hōryū-ji]] are prime examples. By the late 7th century, wood replaced bronze and copper. By the early [[Tang dynasty]], greater realism was expressed by fuller forms, long narrow slit eyes, softer facial features, flowing garments and embellishments with ornaments such as bracelets and jewels. Two prominent examples of sculptures of this period are the [[Avalokiteśvara|Shō Kannon]] at [[Yakushi-ji]] and the Yumechigai Kannon at Hōryū-ji.&lt;ref name="stat-asuka"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asukanet"&gt;{{cite web

During the [[Nara period]], from 710 to 794, the government established and supported workshops called zōbussho, the most prominent of which was located in the capital [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] at [[Tōdai-ji]], which produced Buddhist statuary. Clay, [[lacquer]] and wood, in addition to bronze, were used. Stylistically, the sculptures were influenced by the high Tang style, showing fuller body modelling, more natural drapery and a greater sense of movement. Representative examples of Nara period sculpture include the Great Buddha and the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] at Tōdai-ji, or the Eight Legions at [[Kōfuku-ji]].&lt;ref name="stat-nara"&gt;{{cite web

Early [[Heian period]] works before the mid-10th century appear heavy compared to Nara period statues, carved from single blocks of wood, and characterised by draperies carved with alternating round and sharply cut folds. Stylistically, they followed high to later Tang style. In the Heian period the zōbussho were replaced with temple-run and independent workshops; wood became the primary medium; and a specific Japanese style emerged. By the mid-10th century, the style was refined presenting a more calm and gentle appearance, with attenuated proportions. [[Jōchō]] was the most important sculptor of this time, and he used the ''yosegi'' technique, in which several pieces of wood are joined to sculpt a single figure. He was the ancestor of three important schools of Japanese Buddhist statuary: the {{Not a typo|Enpa}}, Inpa and Keiha school. The [[Amida Nyorai]] at [[Byōdō-in]] is the only extant work by Jōchō.&lt;ref name="stat-nara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stat-heian"&gt;{{cite web

Japanese sculpture experienced a renaissance during the [[Kamakura period]], led by the [[Kei school]]. Partially influenced by [[Song dynasty]] China, their sculpture is characterised by realism featuring elaborate top knots, jewelry, and wavy drapery. Although predominantly wooden, bronze was also used as a material for the statues. As a novelty, portrait sculptures of prominent monks were created adjacent to the depiction of Buddhist deities.&lt;ref name="stat-kamakura"&gt;{{cite web

These sculptures adhere to the current definition, and have been designated national treasures since the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties came into force on June 9, 1951.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt; This list presents 136 entries of sculptures, including those from Classical and early Feudal Japan of the 7th-century [[Asuka period]] to the 13th-century [[Kamakura period]], although the number of sculptures is higher, because groups of related sculptures have sometimes been joined to form single entries. The sculptures listed depict Buddhist and [[Shintō]] deities or priests venerated as founders of temples. Some of the most ancient sculptures were imported directly from China.&lt;ref name="ACA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stbook"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ogawa|Seki|Yamazaki|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Various materials have been used for the sculptures. Although most are wooden, 12 entries in the list are bronze, 11 are [[lacquer]], 7 are made of clay and 1 entry, the [[Usuki Stone Buddhas]], is a stone sculpture. Typically [[hinoki]], [[Torreya nucifera|Japanese nutmeg]], [[sandalwood]] and [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphorwood]] were the woods used for the wooden sculptures. Wooden sculptures were often lacquered or covered with gold-leaf. The smallest statue measures around {{convert|10|cm}}, whereas the Great Buddhas of Nara and Kamakura are about {{convert|13|m}} and {{convert|15|m}} high. The objects on the list are located in Buddhist temples, or in museums associated with temples. Some items are located in shrines, as well as in secular museums.&lt;ref name="ACA"&gt;{{cite web

[[Nara Prefecture]] is home to the largest number of National Treasure sculptures, with 75 of the 136 entries. Together with the 39 entries located in [[Kyoto Prefecture]], they constitute the bulk of sculptural National Treasures. [[Hōryū-ji]] and [[Kōfuku-ji]] are the locations with the most entries, with 17 and 18 designations respectively.

'''''Lucretia''''' is a 1666 history painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Rembrandt]] in the collection of the [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]].

==Painting ==
[[File:Rembrandt van Rijn - Lucretia - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|''[[Lucretia (Rembrandt, 1664)|Lucretia]]'', 1664 (attribution debated)]]

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1915, who wrote:"220. LUCRETIA. [[Eugène Dutuit|Dut.]] 115 ; Wb. 267. She has a dagger in her right hand, and holds a cord in her left hand. "Of nobler composition and greater breadth of light than is usual in Rembrandt ; at the same time the treatment is of singular breadth and spirit" ([[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]]). Dated 1666. In the Wombwell collection, London, 1854 (Waagen, ii. 308).&lt;br&gt;
220a. Lucretia with the Dagger. The sitter is a genuine Dutch-woman, but the expression of pain is well rendered not only in the features but also in the pale colour. Admirably painted. Mentioned by Waagen, iv. 477. In the Radziwill collection, according to the Burdon catalogue. 
''Sales''. London, 1853 (Burdon). W. W. Burdon of Newcastle, London, 1862 (bought in)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn06hofsuoft#page/144/mode/1up  Entry 220 for ''''Lucretia''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the RKD both catalog number 220 and 220a refer to the same painting, in the collections of John Calvert Wombwell and [[Michał Hieronim Radziwiłł]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/59675 Lucretia] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years earlier Rembrandt possibly made [[Lucretia (Rembrandt, 1664)|another painting]] of Lucretia, depicting the moment before she stabs herself; the attribution is debated.

The '''National Federation of Music Clubs''' was founded in 1898, became an [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] member of the [[United Nations]] in 1949, and was chartered by the [[U.S. Congress]] in 1982.  NFMC is a [[non-profit]] philanthropic music organization whose goal is to promote American music, performers, and composers through quality music education and supporting the highest standards of musical creativity and performance. NFMC headquarters are located in [[Greenwood, Indiana]].

NFMC provides opportunities for musical study, performance and appreciation to more than 120,000 senior, student and junior members in 6,500 music-related clubs and organizations nationwide. Members are professional and amateur musicians, vocalists, composers, dancers, performing artists, arts and music educators, music students, generous music patrons and benefactors, and music lovers of all ages.

Dedicated to finding and fostering young musical talent, the NFMC conducts annual Junior Festivals with more than 117,000 participants. NFMC offers more than three quarters of a million dollars in state and national competitions (see competitions), including four $20,000 biennial Young Artist awards, and the $20,000 Ellis Award for Duo-Pianists. The Young Artist and Ellis Duo Piano awards include two years of performance bookings.

Federation members work to create a dynamic musical and cultural environment in their communities through education and sponsorship of musical events. The Federation champions American music with awards and commissions. Federated States proclaim November American Music Month, in which the annual Parade of American Music focuses on programs of music by American composers. Awards are given annually to recognize educational institutions for their promotion and presentation of American music.

Other areas of Federation interest include:

Sponsoring of National Music Week, the first week of May each year
Support for legislation on bills affecting the welfare of musicians, music education and development of American musical life
Recognizes and promotes outstanding American music and composers annually through programs such as American Music Month (November), Parade of American Music and Crusade for Strings

An '''[[Oba (ruler)|Oba]]'s crown''' represents the highest level of authority vested in [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] rulers. Referred to as an '''ade''', the bead-embroidered crown is the foremost attribute of the ruler. An oba's crown may also be referred to as an '''adenla''', or great crown. Andenlas are elaborate conical headdresses, like the ade, but feature a heavily beaded veil that covers the face. In his article on the topic, Robert F. Thompson writes, "The crown incarnates the intuition of royal ancestral force, the revelation of great moral insight in the person of the king, and the glitter of aesthetic experience."&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Robert F.|title=African art &amp; leadership|year=1972|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison|isbn=0299058204|pages=227–260|authorlink=The Sign of the Divine King: Yoruba Bead-Embroidered Crowns with Veil and Bird Decorations|editor=Douglas Fraser and Herbert M. Cole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
After being consecrated as leader, a Yoruba oba must not reveal his face to the public. Instead, he wears an ade or adenla. Oba crowns typically feature at least one stylized face depicted in applied beadwork and designed to identify the king when appearing in public. Some examples of crowns have more than one face. Although their significance is unknown, depictions are frequently associated with [[Odùduwà]], and suggest a shared destiny between a leader and his predecessors.  Crowns embody the continuity of office, regardless of who may hold it at a particular point in time. Faces may also be depicted on other forms of royal regalia, which indicates the omnipotent, all-seeing power of the monarch and his capacity to provide good leadership.

Some crowns (called oríkògbófo) reflect the personal taste of a [[king]]. These include a mask referred to as the “dog-eared-one” (abetíajá), which is worn in such a way that the faces are oriented sideways, and smaller hats shaped like pillboxes, European crowns, and coronets. [[Babatunde Lawal]] writes: "Other crowns were influenced by [[court dress#Commonwealth countries|European style lawyers' wigs]], reflecting the radical changes that occurred in Yorubaland between the late nineteenth century and 1960, when the kings lost much of their political power to French and British colonial administrations. Although their position is largely ceremonial today, kings are still consulted by the state government before certain decisions are made. A wig-like crown presents a king as an effective advocate for his subjects." &lt;ref name=Lawal&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawal|first=Babatunde|title=Embodying the sacred in Yoruba art : featuring the Bernard and Patricia Wagner Collection|year=2007|publisher=High Museum of Art|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=1932543201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert F. Thompson describes the impressive visual effect of the beaded veil in ritual context:&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaguely perceived outlines of the face of the ruler match, in a sense, the generalized qualities of the frontal faces on the crown. Veiling diminishes the wearer's individuality so that he, too, becomes a generalized entity. Balance between the present and past emerges. No longer an individual, the king becomes the dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Orangun-Ila, the ''ade'' is an ''[[Orisha|orisa]]''. When the ade is placed upon the king's head, his [[Ase (Yoruba)#The head as the site of ase|''ori uni'']] (inner head) becomes one with those who have reigned before him, who are also considered ''orisa''.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt;

==Bird Motif==
The bird motif on most crowns has layers of meaning. It recalls how [[Odùduwà]], assisted by a mythical bird, created habitable land on the primordial waters at [[Ile Ife|Ilé Ifè]], where he eventually became the first king. It is also emblematic of the role of the king as an intermediary between his subjects and the [[Orisa|òrìsà]], in the same way that a bird mediates between heaven and earth. Finally, it alludes to a mystical power (àse) that [[Olorun|Olòdúmarè]] reportedly gave to the first female (in the form of a bird enclosed in a calabash), thus allowing her to counterbalance the muscular advantage of men. This mystical power is said to be responsible not only for her ability to procreate but also for her capacity to turn into a bird at night to do good or evil. Thus, by having a symbol of archetypal female power on his crown, a king is expected to manipulate that power for the good of all. This explains why the Ìyá Oba (Official Mother of the King) crowns a new monarch in some towns — to underscore the fact that he has the support of the women.&lt;ref name=Drewal /&gt; Bird motifs are also present on other sacred or otherwise important objects such as [[Osanyin staff]]s.

==History==
There are a variety of differing stories that speak to the history of the ade, or the Oba's crown. What most of these stories have in common is that they acknowledge the primacy of [[Ile-Ife]] as the first "crowned town" from which all Yoruba kings can trace their descent.

One of these ancient stories states that before he died, [[Oduduwa]], the founder and first king of the Yoruba people, gave a beaded crown to each of his sons and sent them forth to establish their own kingdoms. Another story states that when [[Oduduwa]] was old and almost blind, his sons stole their father's ades and with the authority of the ade established their own kingdoms. This story parallels the breakup of the [[Oyo Empire]] into multiple, smaller kingdoms.

Since the mid-nineteenth century, the authority of the oba has been established through an identification with [[Oduduwa]] and [[Ile-Ife]].&lt;ref name=Drewal&gt;{{cite book |last=Drewal |first=Henry John |title=Yoruba : nine centuries of African art and thought|year=1989|publisher=Center for African Art in Association with H.N. Abrams|location=New York|isbn=0810917947|pages=33–39|edition=2nd print |author2=John Pemberton 3rd |author3=Rowland Abiodun |editor=Allen Wardwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beads and their significance==
Religious text and legend dictate that Yoruba gods chose beaded strands as their emblems. Yoruba crowns, embellished with beaded embroidery, connote power by divine sanction. In fact, only a select few in Yoruba society are permitted to wear or use beaded objects, including kings, [[Tribal chief|chief]]s, [[prince]]s, [[priest]]s, [[diviner]]s and [[Witch doctor|native doctor]]s.&lt;ref name=Thompson /&gt;

Today, crowns are embellished with imported colored beads from [[England]]. Formerly, red jasper beads were imported from Litingo in [[French Upper Volta|Upper Volta]] and fashioned and polished at [[Oyo-Ile]] (Old Oyo). In antiquity, beads were made in [[Ile-Ife]].&lt;ref name=Ojo&gt;{{cite book|last=Ojo|first=G. J. Afolabi|title=Yoruba Culture|year=1966|location=London|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bead embroidery is practiced by extremely skilled men in a number of Nigerian centers, especially at Efon-Alaye, [[Ile-Ife]], [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]], [[Ilesha]], [[Abeokuta]], and [[Iperu, Remo|Iperu-Remo]].

Beads and the process of using them in art and ritual are endowed with multiple layers of meaning and significance. 
Beads and covering oneself in them is healing: Colorful beads are considered to be ''charms'' (''oogun'') that act upon malevolent forces. To wear neck beads (''kele'') in contrasting shades of red (''pupa'') and white (''funfun'') signifies both the punitive and the healing presence of [[Shango]], the Yoruba god of thunder.&lt;ref name="Drewal 1998" /&gt;

The art of beading, or stringing, follows the serial process and seriate composition of Yoruba art, an extension of the fundamental principle of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. One bead in a step-by-step (''leseese'') or one-by-one (''leto-lto'') manner. Just as the wrapped bundle of wooden sticks (atoori) on an [[Benin ancestral altars|ancestral altar]] symbolizes the continuity of a family legacy, beads symbolize consistent continuity from generation to generation. When threaded together, beads represent solidarity and unity.&lt;ref name="Drewal 1998" /&gt;

As they encircle and adorn parts of the body, beads conceal and protect a person's [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]] and, through their symbolic meaning, may also reveal essential characteristics of that person.&lt;ref name="Drewal 1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Drewal|first=Henry John|title=Yorùbá Beadwork in Africa|journal=African Arts|date=Winter 1998|volume=31|issue=1|jstor=3337620 |publisher=UCLA James S. Coleman African Studies Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

''[[The New York Times]]'' has described the new Paris campus as "both the oldest and newest overseas branch of an American university".&lt;ref name="NYT Parsons reopens"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/12/world/europe/12iht-educside12.html?_r=0|title=Parsons to Re-Open Campus in Paris|author= D. D. GUTTENPLAN |date=  November 11, 2012|work= |publisher= The New York Times|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, Frank Alvah Parsons opened the Paris Ateliers of the [[New York School of Fine and Applied Art]] (which was renamed Parsons School of Design after its director in 1941).&lt;ref name="NYT Parsons reopens" /&gt; The following year, the school made its home on the oldest planned square in Paris, the [[Place des Vosges]]. Parsons stated: "France, more than any country, has been the center of artistic inspiration since the sixteenth century… The value of associating with, and working from, the finest examples of the periods in decorative art, the adaptation of which is our national problem, needs no comment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dmc.library.newschool.edu:8180/luna/servlet/detail/NSARCH~16~16~7432~100730:New-York-School-of-Fine-and-Applied;jsessionid=A6AEA2AB2A29F7AD342046ABF74D51FF?trs=34&amp;fullTextSearch=fullTextSearch&amp;qvq=q%3AWharton%3Bsort%3ADate%2CTitle%2CIdentifier%2CSubject%3Blc%3ANSARCH~16~16&amp;mi=0&amp;cic=NSARCH~16~16&amp;sort=Date%2CTitle%2CIdentifier%2CSubject
|title=The New School Libraries and Archives|author=|year=1922|work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school offered courses in architecture, interior decoration, stage design, and costume design, adding poster and graphic design a year later. Among its supporters were interior decorator [[Elsie de Wolfe]] and author and interior designer [[Edith Wharton]].

In 1931, interior designer [[Jean-Michel Frank]] led a group of students at the Paris Ateliers to create an icon of modern design, the [[Parsons Table]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.newschool.edu/news/2012/11/parsons-returns-to-paris/ |title=PARSONS RETURNS TO PARIS |author= |date= |work= |publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Original Parsons Table.jpg|thumb|right|Table]] --&gt;

After teaching advertising, illustration, and stage and costume design, Van Day Truex became director of the Paris Ateliers in 1934. An influential voice of 20th-century American design, Truex later became the design director of [[Tiffany &amp; Company]], where he developed the firm’s signature interiors and graphics. Guest critics at the Paris Ateliers during this period include fashion designers [[Jeanne Lanvin]], [[Elsa Schiaparelli]], and [[Jean Patou]].

After closing before the onset of World War II in 1939, Parsons restarted its activities in Paris in 1948 offering a summer course combining travel and study. What was now [[Parsons School of Design]] reopened the School (at first with a summer abroad program in the late 1970s); it became known as Parsons Paris. In 1980, Parsons expanded its Paris program, entering into an educational partnership with the American College in Paris (now [[American University in Paris]]), to offer Bachelor of Fine Arts and study-abroad options. Beginning in 1986, students matriculating in the Parsons Paris program were eligible to receive a degree from Parsons School of Design. But when the contract between Parsons School of Design and Parsons Paris expired in 2008, the former decided not to renew it. At the expiration of the agreement, Parsons notified the Paris school that it could not continue to use the "Parsons" name any longer. The Paris school challenged that decision and brought the legal proceeding before the International Chamber of Commerce who ruled in favor of Parsons School of Design.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newschoolfreepress.com/2012/10/24/well-always-have-paris-and-shanghai-and-mumbai/&lt;/ref&gt; That institution, now called the [[Paris College of Art]], is no longer affiliated with The New School.

Van Zandt]] announced that Parsons School of Design was opening a new academic center in Paris Fall 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://galleristny.com/2012/11/parsons-plans-paris-academic-center-for-fall-2013/ |title=Parsons Plans Paris Academic Center for Fall 2013 |author= Andrew Russeth |date= 11/12/2012 |work= |publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its primary academic building is on rue Saint-Roch in the [[1st arrondissement of Paris]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3263">'''The period eye''' is a concept that was devised by [[Michael Baxandall]] and described in his innovative ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth-Century Italy: A Primer in the Social History of Pictorial Style'' where he used it to describe the cultural conditions under which art in the [[Renaissance]] was created, viewed, and understood.

==The concept==
Baxandall argued that everyone processes visual information in the brain in a different way, using a combination of innate skills and skills based on experience, which are often culturally determined.

"Tombs of the Children of Israel"), are four, formerly five, huge stone structures dated to the [[List of archaeological periods (Levant)|Middle Bronze Age]], which rise from a rocky plateau overlooking [[Wadi Qelt]] in the [[West Bank]], about 3.5 miles northeast of [[Jerusalem]], between [[Hizma]] and [[Geva Binyamin]] along [[List of Israeli highways|Highway 437]]. [[Clermont-Ganneau]], followed by [[R. A. Stewart Macalister|Macalister]], identified the site with the tomb of the biblical matriarch [[Rachel]] based on the [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] text ({{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 10:2}}).&lt;ref name="Research1931"&gt;{{cite book |author= American Schools of Oriental Research |title= Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jO8SAAAAIAAJ |year=1931 |publisher= American Schools of Oriental Research |page=50 |quote= Clermont-Ganneau, followed by Macalister, identified them with the tomb of Rachel referred to in I Samuel x:2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Strickert"/&gt;

==Archaeological survey and excavation==
The [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] survey gives the site the identification code Hizma, site number 480 in Benjamin, coordinates 17580 and 13880.&lt;ref name="IAAsurvey"&gt;{{cite book |editors= Israel Finkelstein, Yitzhak Magen |title= Archaeological Survey of the Hill Country of Benjamin |location= Jerusalem |publisher= IAA Publications |page=63 |year=1993 |via=Strickert }}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied during the Middle Bronze Age.&lt;ref name="IAAsurvey"/&gt; Excavation work was executed by Tzur Abeles,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/abraham/licenses.pdf  Excavation Permits granted by the Staff Officer for Archaeology in the West Bank, 1968-2007]&lt;/ref&gt; who published the results in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alt-arch.org/he/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bibliography_sourcebook.pdf  Bibliography list]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
==Description==
There were originally five structures, but one was demolished in the late 1980s to make way for the [[Ramallah]] bypass road.&lt;ref name="Etshalom"&gt;Etshalom, Yitzchak, [https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/41940229/kever-rachel-the-anorthern-theorya-by-torahorg  ''Kever Rachel: The "Northern Theory"''], see part VII (pg. 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis-Hugues Vincent]] researched the site and found five very large stone structures, between 10-53 metres long and 2.8-6.62 metres high, each with a funerary room in its centre.&lt;ref name="Strickert"/&gt; The rough-hewn stone blocks form rectangular walled structures.{{cn|date=June 2018}} Vincent studied the building style and drew the conclusion that they were erected by [[Bronze Age]] nomadic shepherds, who would bring their dead back here and bury them inside the structures.&lt;ref name="Strickert"/&gt;

==Name==
Vincent asked the local inhabitants for the name of the site, which he was told is ''Qubbur Bene Israin'', "Tombs of the Sons of Israel"; and of the largest structure, which they named as ''Qaber Um Bene Israin'', "Tomb of the Mother of the Sons of Israel".&lt;ref name="Strickert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritter"/&gt;

==Possible biblical connections==
It can be hypothesised from the name ''Qaber Um Bene Israin'', "Tombs of the Mothers of the Sons of Israel", that this is the tomb of Rachel (see {{Bibleref2|1 Samuel 10}}), or that there is a connection to the death and burial of the nurse Deborah "below [[Bethel]]" from {{Bibleref2|Genesis 35:8}}, as well as to the passage about the oak of Tabor being near Rachel's tomb in 1 Samuel 10.&lt;ref name="Strickert"/&gt;

{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}
In the [[music industry]], a '''reissue''' (also '''re-release''', or '''repackage''', or '''re-edition''') is the release of an [[album]] or [[Single (music)|single]] which has been released at least once before, sometimes with alterations or additions.

==Reasons for reissue==

===New audio formats===

Recordings originally released in an audio format that has become technologically or commercially obsolete are reissued in new formats. For example, thousands of original [[vinyl record|vinyl]] albums have been reissued on [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|CDs]] since introduction of that format in the early 1980s. More recently, many albums originally released on CD or earlier formats have been reissued on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]] or [[DVD-Audio]].

===Budget records===

Beginning with [[Pickwick Records]], which acquired the rights to reissue many of [[Capitol Records]]' non-current albums at a low price in venues other than record stores, several record companies started "budget" or "[[drugstore records]]" subsidiaries to sell their deleted items at lower prices.

===New ownership===

When one record label buys out another record label or acquires an individual recording artist's back catalogue, their albums are often reissued on the purchasing label. For example, [[Polydor Records]] reissued many of [[James Brown]]'s albums which were originally released on his former label, [[King Records (USA)|King Records]]. King Records had itself previously reissued albums and [[Single (music)|single]]s by Brown that were originally recorded for its subsidiary label, [[Federal Records]].

===Strong or weak sales===

Recordings are reissued to meet continuing [[demand]] for an album that continues to be popular after its original release. In other cases, albums are reissued to create interest in and hopefully revive the sales of a release which has sold poorly. For example, the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] label [[Roadrunner Records]] is notorious for reissuing their artist's works' only months after releasing the original album. According to US music magazine ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', reissues target "casual consumers who hadn't picked up the album when it was originally released, as well as obsessives who need to own every song in an artist's catalog."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6304512/beyonce-platinum-edition-box-set-essay?facebook_20141104 |title=Beyonce's Platinum Edition: Feeling a Twinge of Disappointment About The False Rumors |first=Jason |last=Lipshutz |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |location=New York |date=November 4, 2014 |accessdate=November 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special, Limited and Commemorative Editions===

Some recordings are reissued to celebrate their popularity, influence, or an [[anniversary]] of the artist or the recording.

===Track controversy and revisionism===

Some recordings are reissued soon after their original release because one of the tracks was seen in a negative light. "[[Cop Killer (song)|Cop Killer]]" by [[Body Count (band)|Body Count]] was one such example.

Some recordings are [[remix]]ed and reissued in an effort to erase prior band member’s contributions.  Two such examples were [[Ozzy Osbourne]]’s ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]'' and ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/ozzy_osbourne_classic_album_reissues_due_in_may.html|title= Classic Album Reissues, due in May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ultimateclassicrock.com/former-ozzy-osbourne-bandmate-bob-daisley-dishes-dirt-on-last-years-ozzy-reissues|title= Ultimate Classic Rock, on last year’s Ozzy reissues}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alterations==
Common additions to reissued albums include:

* Audio [[Audio mastering|remastering]]
* Inclusion of [[bonus track]]s or [[multimedia]] content
* New [[liner notes]]
* New [[album art]] or [[packaging]]
* Modifiers in the title such as "[[Special Edition]]" or "Expanded Version"

==Reissues and certification==
For the purposes of quantifying sales, an album's original and subsequent releases are counted together. For example, if an album sold 300,000 of its original release and 700,000 in subsequent reissues, it would be entitled to [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] certification. However, the musical contents of the original disc must remain the same on a reissue for it to count towards certification.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Reissue labels==
Some [[record label]]s specialize in reissuing recordings originally released on other labels. Three of the biggest reissue labels are [[Rhino Records]], [[Hip-O Records]], and [[Legacy Recordings]]. Each of these companies reissues material from the labels of a major music [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]: [[Warner Music Group]], [[Universal Music Group]], and [[Sony BMG]], respectively. [[Collectables Records]] is another prolific reissue label that [[license]]s recordings from other labels.

The '''Religious Technology Center''' ('''RTC''') is an American [[non-profit corporation]]&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[commons:File:IRS-Recognition-Denmark.djvu|Letter by the Internal Revenue Service to Flemming Paludan, Regional Director, Danish Tax-Office, Washington, D.C., USA, December 22, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenoer|first=Jonathan |title=Cyberlaw: the law of the Internet|publisher=Springer|year=1997|page=62|isbn=978-0-387-94832-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HlG2esMIm7kC&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=%22Religious+Technology+Center%22+%22non-profit%22&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Religious%20Technology%20Center%22%20%22non-profit%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was founded in 1982 by the [[Church of Scientology]] to control and oversee the use of all of the trademarks, symbols and texts of [[Scientology]] and [[Dianetics]]. Although RTC controls their use, those works are owned by another corporation, the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] which is [[doing business as]] L. Ron Hubbard Library, registered in [[Los Angeles County]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavote.net/CLERK/FBN_Search.cfm Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk, as an example] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628174722/http://www.lavote.net/CLERK/FBN_Search.cfm |date=2007-06-28 }}, under "HUBBARD L RON LIBRARY"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientology.org/csi.htm Notice for Materials Copyrighted to Church of Scientology International]&lt;/ref&gt;

While exercising authority over the use of all Dianetics and Scientology materials, RTC claims that it is not involved in the day-to-day management of the Church of Scientology; that role is assigned to a separate corporation, the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI).
According to the RTC website, "RTC stands apart as an external body which protects the Scientology religion and acts as the final arbiter of orthodoxy" and its stated purpose is "to protect the public from misapplication of the technology and to see that the religious technologies of Dianetics and Scientology remain in proper hands and are properly ministered."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html Section of RTC Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430043739/http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html |date=2006-04-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1986, [[David Miscavige]] has served as the organization's Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In a 1993 [[memorandum]] by the [[Church of Scientology International]], the following information was provided to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] with regards to RTC's role and functions, its personnel and its income:&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Summary Description RTC-CSI.pdf|Summary Description of Churches of Scientology - RTC, CSI, CSFSSO, CSFSO, Other Churches, Missions, Field Ministers, CSI Prod. 11-4-93, Bate Stamp: 151396 - 151398, Ex. 1-3, Washington, DC, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] RTC [...] owns the Scientology religious marks and advanced technology. It licenses the marks to CSI for sublicense to subordinate churches and directly licenses the advanced technology to appropriate churches. Through this structure RTC assures that practice of the Scientology religion within the ecclesiastical hierarchy under CSI's authority as Mother Church remains strictly orthodox, in accordance with the Scientology Scriptures. This church has a staff of approximately 50 individuals and an annual budget of approximately $ 6.6 million, based on its annual disbursements for the most recent year for which financial statements are available. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The RTC guarantees the “purity and workability of Scientology so far into the future,” thus engaging in programs to “restore, preserve, maintain and keep uncorrupted” the church’s "religious technology," according to Scientology spokesman Eric Roux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Scientology faces ban in Belgium | url = http://www.news.com.au/world/europe/scientology-faces-ban-in-belgium-amid-fraud-allegations/news-story/c8433d3f797edff382cfd35608e09d2b | work = AFP | publisher = news.com.au | date = December 12, 2015 | accessdate = March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roux |first1=Eric |title=Cult Wars in Historical Perspective: New and Minority Religions |chapter=Scientology |editor-last=Gallagher |editor-first=Eugene V. |publisher=Routledge |date=21 July 2016 |isbn=978-1472458124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate information==
[[File:Church of Scientology building in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.jpeg|thumb|Offices of the Religious Technology Center in Los Angeles]]
RTC was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] on January 1, 1982 in Los Angeles, California by Terri Gamboa, [[David Mayo (Scientology)|David Mayo]], Norman Starkey, Phoebe Mauerer, Lyman Spurlock, Julia Watson, and [[David Miscavige]].&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:RTC-Incorporation.djvu|Articles of Incorporation of Religious Technology Center, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State of the State of California, Los Angeles, California, January 1, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; Six months later, on June 15, 1982, the [[Articles of Incorporation]] were restated.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:RTC-Restated-Incorporation.djvu|Restated Articles of Incorporation of Religious Technology Center, Bate Stamp: A 253931, Los Angeles, California, June 15th &amp; September 13th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 8, 1986 they were amended in order to clarify the [[disposition]] of RTC's [[assets]] upon the [[dissolution (law)|dissolution]] of the [[corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:RTC-Certificate-Amendment.djvu|Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation - Religious Technology Center, Los Angeles, California, April 8th, May 13th &amp; 14th, 1986]]&lt;/ref&gt;

At present the official address of RTC is 1710 Ivar Avenue, Suite 1100, Los Angeles 90028, in the Hollywood Guaranty Building, while its main offices are on a big estate complex at 19625 Highway 79, Gilman Hot Springs 92383, California, as it was stated in a supporting document of Scientology's tax-exempt application to the IRS during the years 1992/1993.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Location-RTC.pdf|Response to Second Series of Questions, Church of Scientology International, Correspondence with Internal Revenue Service, Exhibit for Application for Tax-Exempt Status 501(c)(3), June 29th, 1992]]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 21, 1993 the following individuals held [[corporate]] positions at RTC: The [[Board of Trustees]] was composed of [[David Miscavige]], Gregory Wilhere, and Norman F. Starkey. The members of RTC's [[Board of Directors]] were at that time [[Mark Rathbun]], Warren McShane, and [[David Miscavige]]. RTC's [[President (corporate title)|President]] was [[Mark Rathbun]], its [[Secretary]] Warren McShane, and its [[Treasurer]] Barbara Griffin.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:CoS-Trustees-Directors-Officers-1993.pdf|List of Trustees, Directors &amp; Officers (of Church of Scientology Entities) - Ex.

As of February 5, 2001 RTC's corporate [[board of directors|officers]] were Warren McShane ([[Chief Executive Officer]]/[[President (corporate title)|President]]), Laurisse Stuckenbrock ([[Secretary]]), and Barbara Griffin ([[Chief Financial Officer]]/[[Treasurer]]).&lt;ref&gt;Statement by Domestic Nonprofit Corporation, Religious Technology Center, Secretary of State, State of California, Filed: Sacramento, California, February 9th, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 14, 2008, RTC's official [[Agent (law)|agent]] has been the attorney Sherman D. Lenske from the law firm Lenske, Lenske &amp; Abramson ALC, Warner Atrium, 6400 Canoga Avenue, Suite 315, Woodland Hills 91367-2491.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C1063697 Entry for Religious Technology Center, California Business Portal of the Secretary of the State of California/March 22, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180322/http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/corpdata/ShowAllList?QueryCorpNumber=C1063697 |date=March 3, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 19, 1993, RTC filed an application for [[tax exemption]] under section [[501(c)(3)]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[:File:Application-501-RTC.pdf|Form 1023 - Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501 (c) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code - Religious Technology Center, Washington, DC, August 19th, 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year the [[Internal Revenue Service]] granted RTC's request for exemption.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The granting of tax exemption to RTC and other Scientology corporations was preceded by years of continuous litigation between the IRS and the various entities of Scientology. According to former high-ranking executives, the Scientology organization had launched about 200 [[lawsuits]] against the IRS until 1991. During the same time, individual [[parish]]ioners of Scientology had initiated 2,300 [[Claim (legal)|claims]] against the agency, challenging the denial of tax deduction for their services at Scientology organizations. Late 1991, the dispute over Scientology's tax-exempt status began to resolve through high-level meetings between [[David Miscavige]] and the then [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner of the IRS]], Fred Goldberg, who encouraged a final resolution of the legal battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tampabay.com/news/article1012148.ece Scientology: The Truth Rundown, Part 1 of 3 in a special report on the Church of Scientology, By Joe Childs &amp; Thomas C.

'''Main Corporate Activities'''

The Religious Technology Center (RTC) is the [[owner]] of certain [[trademarks]] and [[service marks]]. These marks and its related [[intellectual property]] form the "Dianetics spiritual healing technology" and the "Scientology applied religious technology".&lt;ref&gt;Copyright and trademark notice of the book "Dianetics" by L. Ron Hubbard, Los Angeles, California, (c) 1950, 2000, {{ISBN|0-88404-632-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology organizations, like "Churches," "Celebrity Centres" or "Missions," derive their income from the worldwide sales of this "technology" in form of courses, books, etc. to their members or to the general public. The organizations receive the right to sell the "technology" through license agreements with RTC as license holder and/or the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI) as a sub-licensor. RTC and CSI in return derive their corporative income through the license fees, which in turn are obtained through those agreements. The licensing and its related actions are major corporate activities of the various Scientology-organizations.&lt;ref name="LicenseAgreement"&gt;[[:File:License-Agreement-RTC-CSI.pdf|"License Agreement - CSI (Marks)", License Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Church of Scientology International, California, May 18th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Licensing of Trademarks &amp; Service Marks'''

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] (CST)''

Shortly after its inception on January 1, 1982, RTC received on May 16, 1982 "the ownership, supervision and control" of the trademarks and service marks identifying "Scientology applied religious philosophy" and "Dianetics spiritual healing technology" by the originator and founder of Scientology, [[L. Ron Hubbard]] through an "[[Assignment (law)|Assignment]] [[Contract|Agreement]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Assignment-RTC.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, County of Los Angeles, California, May 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement was subject to an additional "Option Agreement" between Hubbard, RTC and another Scientology corporation, the "[[Church of Spiritual Technology]]" (CST). In two "Option Agreements" from May 1982, Hubbard granted CST the right to purchase at any time from RTC the "Marks", the "Advanced Technology" and all the rights to them for the sum of $100.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST.pdf|"Option Agreement (Marks)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, County of Los Angeles, California, May 10th, 1982/July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Option-Agreement-LRH-CST-AT.pdf|Option Agreement (Advanced Technology-U.S.) - Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Church of Spiritual Technology, California, May 10th &amp; July 9th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel and similar-sounding agreements between Hubbard, RTC and CST were created during that period concerning the "Advanced Technology," which consists of unpublished derivates of Scientology's confidential "Advanced technology".&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Assignment-Agreement-LRH-RTC-AT.pdf|"Assignment Agreement (LRH/RTC) (Advanced Technology - US)", Notarized Agreement between L. Ron Hubbard and the Religious Technology Center, Los Angeles, California, May 10th &amp; 16th, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these agreements RTC is to turn over 90% of its net income to CST. A document from 1991, reflecting the "financial money flows" of RTC during the year 1989, showed a turnover of 59% of RTC's net income towards CST.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Analysis-Financial-Flows-RTC.pdf|"Religious Technology Center - Analysis of Financial Flows 1989", Exhibit I-9 for Application for Tax-Exempt Status 501(c)(3), Bate Stamp: CSI Prod 11-4-93 151414]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI)''

RTC and CSI entered a license agreement on May 18, 1982, granting CSI, the new "Mother Church of Scientology," the right to use and sub-license certain of the trademarks and service marks. In return for the grant of the marks, the agreement gave RTC practically an unlimited corporate control not only over the activities of CSI but also over every organization that is a sub-licensee of CSI.&lt;ref name="LicenseAgreement"/&gt;

In particular the agreement stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] d) RTC shall have the right to monitor all operations of CSI and its related organizations, inspect all books, records and facilities, pertaining to use of the Marks and receive sample specimens and summaries of literature, publications and products using the marks, [...] e) RTC may, if it ever deems it necessary or advisable, send a corrective mission to any organization authorized the Marks to correct any deviation from the standards, specifications or guidelines of this Agreement, [... ]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally RTC and CSI signed on January 1, 1982 an "Organizational Covenant" granting CSI the right to deliver the "Advanced Technology" to its staff members.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CSI-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between Church of Scientology International &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably Los Angeles, California, January 1st, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Scientology Western United States]] (CoSWUS)''

RTC and CoSWUS entered on May 23, 1985 an organizational covenant granting CoSWUS the right to sell and deliver the "Advanced Technology" to its public members while guaranteeing weekly payments of 6% of the monetary value of the "Advanced Technology"-services that are being delivered to the public from CoSWUS towards RTC.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CSWUS-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between the Church of Scientology Western United States &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably: Los Angeles, California, May 23rd, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and [[Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization, Inc.]] (FSO)''

On January 1, 1982 RTC and FSO signed an organizational covenant with similar content to the covenant between RTC and CoSWUS.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CSFSO-AT.pdf|"Organizational Covenant - Advanced Technology - US", Covenant between Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization &amp; Religious Technology Center, Location: probably Clearwater, Florida, January 1st, 1982]]&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Religious Technology Center (RTC) and other Scientology organizations''

RTC has entered over the years similar organizational covenants/license agreements with all the other "Advanced Organizations" (AOs) within the Scientology network. As all the AO's are integrated within a corporation, these agreements are formulated between RTC and these corporations, such as "Church of Scientology Flag Ship Service Organization, Inc." from Netherlands Antilles,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:License-Agreement-RTC-FSSO.pdf|License Agreement - RTC/Licensee - License Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Church of Scientology Flag Ship Service Organization, Netherlands Antilles, June 2nd, 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Church of Scientology Religious Education College, Inc." from East Grinstead, England,&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CoSRECI-AT.pdf|Advanced Technology Covenant RTC/RECI, Covenant between Religious Technology Center &amp; Church of Scientology Religious Education College, Inc., East Grinstead, England, November 18th, &amp; December 1st, 1988]]&lt;/ref&gt; the "Church of Scientology, Inc." from Sydney, Australia&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-CoSInc-AT.pdf|Advanced Technology Covenant RTC/Church of Scientology (Australia), Covenant between Religious Technology Center &amp; Church of Scientology Inc., Sydney, Australia, December 24th, 1988 &amp; March 16th, 1989]]&lt;/ref&gt; and with "Church of Scientology Advanced Organization Saint Hill Europe &amp; Africa" (AOSH EU).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Covenant-RTC-AOSHEU-AT.pdf|Example Covenant: "Advanced Technology Covenant - RTC/AOSH", Covenant between the Church of Scientology Advanced Organization Saint Hill Europe &amp; Africa &amp; Religious Technology Center, Copenhagen, Denmark, December 1st, 1988, November 25th &amp; December 14th, 1989]]&lt;/ref&gt;

RTC has registered its service marks and trademarks in various countries all over the world. Due to certain legal restrictions for religious corporations in certain countries, RTC founded the corporation "Inspector General Network, Inc." (IGN) on June 7, 1985, which functions as a "secular" representative for RTC in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Amendement-Incorporation-IGN.pdf|Notarized Certificate of Amendment of Articles of Incorporation, Inspector General Network, Endorsed Filed in the Office of the Secretary of State in the State of California, CSI Prod - November 22, 1993 - Bate Stamp: 237255, Los Angeles, California, June 7th, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 RTC entered with IGN a so-called "Reversion and Reservation Agreement", which regulated the rights and obligations with regards to the Scientology and Dianetics trademarks of the "secular" organizations IGN and "World Institute of Scientology Enterprises, Inc." (WISE Inc.), a dormant Delaware corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Reversion-Agreement-RTC-WISE.pdf|Reversion and Reservation Agreement between Religious Technology Center and Inspector General Network, a California non-profit public benefit corporation, Los Angeles, California, June 17th, &amp; 18th, 1985]]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Control of Other Corporations'''

At the time of RTC's filing for [[tax exemption]], RTC controlled four other corporations:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

* ''"Inspector General Network" (IGN)''

IGN has served as [[legal]] [[agent (law)|representative]] for RTC and [[secular]] [[registered owner]] of RTC's [[trademarks|trade]] and [[service marks]] "in countries where contracts by religious corporations are not enforced". All [[corporate]] positions of IGN were held by members of RTC.

* ''"WISE, Inc."''

At the time of [[Scientology|Scientology's]] application for [[tax exemption]], WISE, Inc. has been a dormant [[corporation]] from [[Delaware]]. It had the same functions as IGN, prior to IGN's [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] in 1985.

* ''"RTC Australia"''

RTC Australia was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1986 as a regional office for RTC in Australia. It is a dormant [[corporation]] and has obtained [[tax exempt]] status.

* ''"Inspector General Network International AB" (IGN Int)''

IGN was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1992 in Sweden. The organization was founded to [[Registered trademark symbol|register]] [[Scientology|Scientology's]] [[trademarks|trade]] and [[service marks]] as a [[nominee]] for RTC in [[countries]], such as [[Libya]] or [[Iran]] "that do not recognize and will not do business with any United States entity".

==Organizational structure and management==
RTC stands hierarchically at the top of the [[Church of Scientology]] network. It has regulatory, corporate and [[ecclesiastical]] power over the policy and activities of all other Scientology management units, corporations, churches, missions and other organizations - with the only exception being the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]]. The position of RTC is notably visible in a drawing titled "The Command Channels of Scientology", which the [[Church of Scientology International]] (CSI) and RTC provided to the IRS in their application for tax-exempt status. It should be noted that the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] has not been included in this application.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:Image:Command Channels CoS.jpg|The Command Channels of Scientology, Sketch depicting the hierarchical structure of the network of the Church of Scientology, the drawing was provided by CSI to the IRS in their application for tax-exempt status in September 1993]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In its application for tax exemption, RTC described the internal structure of the organization as follows:&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] RTC's daily activities are carried out by a staff of 54 highly-trained individuals who function in their positions within the overall ecclesiastical hierarchy of the Scientology religion. Through receipt of reports and direct inspections, RTC ensures that those utilizing the marks are ministering orthodox Scientology religious services. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] The senior ecclesiastical position in RTC is held by David Miscavige, who continues to serve as Chairman of the Board RTC and also as Inspector General. There are also several Deputy Inspector Generals who assist in the performance of RTC's
religious functions. There is a Deputy Inspector General who functions as Chairman of the Board RTC's second in command and
sees to the day to day functioning of the organization. There is a Deputy Inspector General who oversees internal matters in RTC
and another who is in charge of RTC's religious programs."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The religious mission of RTC, protecting the orthodoxy of the technologies of Dianetics and Scientology, is carried out by two ecclesiastical divisions within RTC as described below. There is now one Inspectorate division which consists of four departments. The Department of Data receives reports and collects information from other organizations and Scientologists and collates, analyzes and distributes the information to all other departments that require it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Trademark Registration, Maintenance and Enforcement gets the religious marks of Dianetics and Scientology legally registered and sees to it that all users of the marks are properly licensed. It also investigates and, where necessary, prosecutes legal infringements of the marks."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Technical Policing inspects application of the Scientology Scriptures pertaining to the ministry of religious services by licensees and corrects misapplication where it is found."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Department of Organization Policing inspects the application of Scientology Scriptures as it pertains to governance of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and corrects misapplication where it is found."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Authorization, Verification and Correction International ('AVC INT') is a division within RTC which is responsible for authorizing and verifying that the ecclesiastical programs, evaluations, strategies, promotional materials and issues as authored by CSI are in accordance with Scripture. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As previously mentioned, RTC is currently led by the "[[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] (of [[Board of directors|Directors]])" [[David Miscavige]], who has held this position since 1987. Miscavige has been in leading positions within the Scientology management since the early 1980s. Prior to being in his current position, Miscavige had been a member of the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] and had been instrumental in the internal purge of the [[Guardian's Office]], the former [[intelligence service]] and legal defense unit of the Scientology network. In 1982 he became the [[Chief Executive Officer]] and later the [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] of the [[for-profit corporation]] [[Author Services Inc.]] (ASI). Miscavige stayed on this position until 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culteducation.com/reference/scientology/Scien56.html The Man behind Scientology by Thomas C. Tobin, St. Petersburg Times, October 25, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

About the role and the position of the RTC within the structure of the Scientology network, David Miscavige declared in 1994:&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Declaration David Miscavige 1994.pdf|Declaration of David Miscavige, Church of Scientology International vs. Steven Fishman &amp; Uwe Geertz, Case No. CV 91-6426 (HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, Riverside County, February 8th, 1994]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] Since March of 1987, I have been Chairman of the Board of Religious Technology Center [...]. RTC is not part of Church management, nor is it involved in the daily affairs of various Church of Scientology organizations or missions. RTC ensures that the trademarks of Dianetics and Scientology, and the technology they represent, are properly used around the world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] 8 . RTC was formed with the specific purpose of seeing that the religion of Scientology was kept pure and true to the source materials of the religion. In fact, a major reason for its formation was to have such a Church organization that performed these functions in a capacity entirely separate from the actual management of the various Churches and Missions of Scientology. Not only is RTC not involved in the management of the international hierarchy of Scientology churches, but its very existence and performance of its true functions depends on the fact that it is not part of Church management. The authority of the Religious Technology Center stems from the ownership of the trademarks of Dianetics and Scientology.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] 11. Neither RTC nor I has any corporate authority over any Scientology church, including CSI. CSI is the Mother Church of the Scientology religion and has been since its inception in 1981. As such, CSI is responsible for the activities commensurate with such a role, including the ecclesiastical management of Churches, dissemination and propagation of the faith and defense of its activities, including external and legal affairs. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such representations stand in stark contrast to declarations of high-level ex-scientologists, who have worked in the Scientology management. Former CSI security officer Andre Tabayoyon and former RTC second-in-command Jesse Prince have stated in [[affidavit]]s and declarations that RTC and its chairman [[David Miscavige]] maintain de facto control of the entire Scientology network, including the [[Church of Scientology International]].&lt;ref name="prince"&gt;[http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/Media/video/legal/prince_erlich.pdf Affidavit of Jesse Prince] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041101175401/http://lisatrust.bogie.nl/Media/video/legal/prince_erlich.pdf |date=2004-11-01 }} United States District Court, Central District of California, San Jose Division case no. C-95-20091 RMW (EAI)&lt;/ref&gt;

Within that context, André Tabayoyon stated in a 1994 declaration the following about Miscavige's exertion of power as [[Chair (official)|Chairman of the Board]] and ultimate [[head]] of the global [[Scientology]] network:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_at.html Declaration of Andre Tabayoyon from April 4, 1994, Church of Scientology International, Case No. CV 91 6426 HLH (Tx), U.S. District Court for the Central District of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926224143/http://www.whyaretheydead.net/krasel/aff_at.html |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 59. I have personal knowledge that Miscavige issues oral and written orders and instructions to Scientologists irrespective of either ecclesiastical lines of authority or corporate lines of is authority or demarcation. Miscavige uses this omnipotent authority to exercise personal control over any and all Scientology organizations whenever he elects to do so. I observed that in running the various Scientology organizations, Miscavige constantly crosses all corporate and ecclesiastical command lines without regard to the fact that there are numerous Scientology related corporations of which he is neither an employee, officer nor director. He does not have to be to control any Scientology organization. He is above all Scientology organizations as the ecclesiastical head of Scientology, COB RTC and Commander of the Sea Org. In this capacity, Miscavige acts as the managing agent of each Scientology organization."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] 61. I personally observed Miscavige take over this position of ultimate power over all of Scientology after Hubbard died. I observed Miscavige when he was COB RTC ordering into Golden Era Studios ("Gold"), a CSI division, and ordering into the Commodore's Messenger Organization International ("CMO Int"), another CSI division planetary dissemination organization, etc. Both of these Sea Org units are corporately part of CSI. RTC, CMO Int and Gold are all located at a large compound outside of Hemet, California. It is called Gold. As I learned, the Scientology corporate structure was only for the benefit of the outside "wog" world. It didn't have any bearing on how Scientology operated."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"62. When Hubbard was alive it was common knowledge and I also observed it personally that he was in direct control, via Miscavige and [[Pat Broeker]], of CMO Int and Gold, and the rest of Scientology. After Hubbard died[,] Miscavige ousted Pat Broeker and Vicki Aznaran, who were then in control of Scientology. After that, it was my experience that Miscavige had complete control over Scientology just as Hubbard had when he was alive. Miscavige took over Hubbard's place as managing agent of all Scientology organizations. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Mark Rathbun|Mark ("Marty") Rathbun]], [[David Miscavige]] and [[Warren McShane]], Deputy Inspector General for Legal Affairs formed for several years the above-mentioned "Board of Directors RTC".&lt;ref name="rtc.org"&gt;Religious Technology Center, Board of Directors, (c) 1999–2001 Religious Technology Center, http://www.rtc.org/board/&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2008, all references to both Rathbun and McShane have disappeared from the RTC website, and their names or pictures have also been removed from other official Scientology websites. Though Miscavige is still listed as Chairman of the Board, no other board members are acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtc.org/david-miscavige.html David Miscavige - Official website of Religious Technology Center, (c) 1996–2008 Religious Technology Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the executive branch of RTC existed at least until 2001 the position of "Inspector General RTC," which had been held by Mark Rathbun. This network spanned from RTC headquarters in Gilman Hot Springs to all of the "Advanced Organizations" in Los Angeles, Clearwater, East Grinstead, Copenhagen and Sidney, where RTC has maintained offices.&lt;ref name="rtc.org"/&gt;

In an internal newsletter, "Keeping Scientology Working," RTC stated the following about the purpose and duties of the "Inspector General Network":&lt;ref&gt;"Keeping Scientology Working", Caption of photo depicting the staff of the RTC IG Network, page 4, (c) 1995 Church of Scientology International&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"These Deputy Inspector Generals head the entire IG Network, which locates and handles internal and external infiltration and suppression, legally protects and safeguards the trademarks and technology of the religion of Scientology, and sees that management, orgs and missions and their application of tech and policy remain standard and true to LRH's writings."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While RTC has a dominant role over the "mother church," CSI and its subordinate organizations, the relationship to the [[Church of Spiritual Technology]] (CST) is unclear. While the above-mentioned "assignment agreement" with L. Ron Hubbard on May 10, 1982 granted CST corporative authority over RTC with respect to Scientology's trademarks and service marks, there is no sign that CST ever executed any internal, "ecclesiastical" authority over RTC. In fact, the U.S. Claims Court noted in its opinion in a tax case, which involved CST in 1992:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/blog/suleiman2/cst_vs_irs_1992.html Opinion, Church of Spiritual Technology vs. United States, No. 581-88T, United Claims Court, June 29, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"CST claims that it does not and will not monitor RTC's use of the religious marks and technology. CST explains that there is no need to do so because any unorthodox use would be immediately obvious. Regardless of how it arrived at the conclusion, however, the point is that one of its obligations is to prevent misuse of the marks and technology. CST's present confidence in RTC has no significance. If CST ignored that element of its charter, one of the assumptions built into LRH's gift would be missing. Monitoring for a misuse by RTC is a form of ongoing oversight. The decision to exercise the option is an ecclesiastical one which would not be readily susceptible to judicial review."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Litigation==

Since its inception in 1982, RTC has been involved in various [[lawsuit]]s in both [[State court (United States)|state]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. The majority of the cases initiated by RTC contend unauthorized use of Scientology's [[copyright]]s, [[service mark]]s, or [[trademark]]s. Critics of Scientology contend that a great number of these lawsuits have been launched in order "to silence critics."&lt;ref&gt;Church in Cyberspace, Marc Fisher, Washington Post, August 19, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The courts have agreed in some cases; in ''RTC v. Lerma'' Judge Leonie Brinkema found that the RTC's lawsuit was intended to pursue the "broader motivation" of "the stifling of criticism and dissent of the religious practices of Scientology and the destruction of its opponents."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bostonphoenix.com/alt1/archive/specials/scientology/SCIENTOLOGY_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The RTC filed a lawsuit on January 1, 1985 in the [[United States District Court for the Central District of California]] against Robin Scott and the Church of New Civilization (not to be confused with the [[New Civilization Church]]), a Scientology splinter group, alleging [[theft]] and unauthorized use of confidential material owned by RTC. The case took over a decade to resolve, and was dismissed on April 11, 1996 by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]. In its final [[legal opinion|opinion]] the court summarized the history of the case and commented on the conduct of RTC while the case was litigated:&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Religious Technology Center v. Scott|Unpublished Opinion from April 11, 1996, Religious Technology Center et al. vs. Robin Scott et al., 82 F.3d 423, 1996 WL 171443, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] In January 1985 RTC sued Mayo and other persons connected with the Church of the New Civilization, a splinter group of the official Church of Scientology, contending that they were making unauthorized use of stolen documents relating to the religion of Scientology. RTC stated that it was "the protector" of the religion of Scientology, its philosophy and its technology "including the Advanced Technology" consisting of "confidential and proprietary information regarding counseling and training," and was the owner of various trademarks registered with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] protecting the Advanced Technology. [...]"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] After 1,825 docket entries and nine years of pretrial litigation involving three [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] [[United States magistrate judge|magistrates]], a special master, the [[recusal]] of two district court judges, the denial of five petitions for writ of [[mandamus]], three appeals [...] and three denials of [[certiorari]] by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], the third district judge [...] entered Final Judgment."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[...] [T]here is little doubt that RTC is playing "fast and loose" with the judicial system as required in the minority view of [[estoppel]]. To first assert that its unfair competition and false designation of origin claims are [[Justiciability|justiciable]] and at the same time assert that Mayo's identical claims are not is at best questionable; in light of RTC's documented history of [[Vexatious litigation|vexatious behavior]], RTC's actions are indefensible.

The RTC maintains a task force called the Inspector General Network, an investigatory body which operates from seven offices on four different continents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430043739/http://www.rtc.org/en_US/guarant/pg004.html |archivedate=2006-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IGN's stated function is to "keep Scientology working by ensuring the pure and ethical use of Dianetics and Scientology technology."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtc.org/en_US/matters/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022163614/http://www.rtc.org/en_US/matters/index.html |archivedate=2006-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTC, like the Church of Scientology, encourages the use of "Knowledge Reports" (KR) from anyone inside or outside of the Church, to report on potential misuse of the [[Standard Tech]] and copyrighted/trademarked materials. They maintain an online form in which anyone is encouraged to report any such matters that may be of concern.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rtc.org/reports/form/index.html?locale=en&lt;/ref&gt; The use of reports is one system used by RTC to police the use of Scientology materials and the application.

'''Sentimental poetry''' is a [[melodramatic]] [[poetic form]]. It is aimed primarily at stimulating the [[emotion]]s rather than at communicating experience truthfully. [[Grief|Bereavement]] is a common theme of sentimental poetry. 

[[Friedrich Schiller]] discussed sentimental poetry in his influential essay, ''[[On Naïve and Sentimental Poetry]]''.

Sentimental poetry was parodied by [[Mark Twain]] in ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Finch|first1=Annie|title=The Poetess in American Literature|url=http://literature.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190201098.001.0001/acrefore-9780190201098-e-472#acrefore-9780190201098-e-472-div1-1201|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2820">The '''Society of Russian Dramatists and Opera Composers''' ({{lang-ru|Общество русских драматических писателей и оперных композиторов}}) was an organisation launched in 1874 in [[Moscow]] with a view to defending the rights of the authors of music and drama in Russia.&lt;ref name="nat_loch"&gt;Lokhova, Natalya. [http://www.pchela.ru/podshiv/43/administration.htm Not So Much to Guard As to Direct] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160918094037/http://www.pchela.ru/podshiv/43/administration.htm |date=2016-09-18 }} // Не столько охранять, сколько управлять.

==History==
The Assembly of Russian Writers, as it was originally called, was founded on 28 November 1870 by a group of authors who gathered at the place of the translator Vladimir Rodislavsky, initially to find the means for preventing works from being produced on theatre stage without their authors' permission. By the time it was launched officially on 21 October 1874, the organisation included 81 members, among them [[Alexander Ostrovsky]], [[Aleksey Konstantinovich Tolstoy|A.K. Tolstoy]], [[Nikolai Nekrasov]], [[Nikolai Leskov]], [[Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Grigory Danilevsky]] and [[Pyotr Boborykin]]. 

Ostrovsky was elected its first chairman, Rodislavsky its secretary. After Ostrovsky's death, he was succeeded by first [[Sergey Yuriev]], then Apollon Maykov (the slavist, not to be confused with the renowned [[Apollon Maykov|poet]]) and [[Ippolit Shpazhinsky]]. In October 1875 a group of composers led by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] joined in, and the organization's name was changed to the Society of Russian Dramatists and Opera Composers. In 1887 [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko]] and [[Dmitry Mamin-Sibiryak]] became its members.&lt;ref name="nat_loch"/&gt;

In 1904 the Society split into the Moscow and Petersburg sections. Both functioned separately up until 1925 when, re-organized, they merged again into the Union of the Drama and Music Writers (Союз драматических и музыкальных писателей).&lt;ref&gt;The Russian State Archive of Literature and Arts.

[[File:Anthax.jpg|thumb|''Captain Anthrax Vs Doctor Death in the arena of Tiki's'' by [[Regan Tamanui]], the first Stuckist in Australia]]
[[Stuckism]] is an [[art movement]] that began in [[London]], [[England]], in 1999. In 2000, [[Melbourne]] artist [[Regan Tamanui]] started the first international branch of the movement. As of 2010, there are seven Australian Stuckist groups,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/world.html#OZ "Stuckist groups"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 17 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; who have held shows&amp;mdash;sometimes concurrently with UK activities&amp;mdash;received coverage in the Australian press and on TV, and also been represented in UK shows. The Stuckists take a strong pro-painting and anti-conceptual art stance, and were co-founded by [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] and [[Billy Childish]].

==Chronology==
In October 2000, Regan Tamanui founded the Melbourne Stuckists,&lt;ref name=walker&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/stuckists/international/ "International Stuckists"], [[Walker Art Gallery]]. Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; the fourth Stuckist group to be started and the first one outside the UK (there are now 127 groups in 32 countries). On 27 October, he staged the ''Real Turner Prize Show''&lt;ref name=walker/&gt; at the Dead End Gallery in his home, concurrent with three shows with the same title in England ([[London]], [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]] and [[Dartington]]), and one in [[Germany]], in protest against the [[Tate Gallery]]'s [[Turner Prize]].

Besides Tamanui, the other initial members were Justin Grub, Ben Blanchette, Malcome Mmackie and Dave Freeman Rose. A subsequent line-up was Basil Kouvelis, Justin Grubb, Ben Frost, Nigel Stein, Daniel Gorzadek, Stephen Sperling and Dennis Roper. Stein, an RMIT art student, was prompted to join the group after Karen Ward was given the inaugural $105,000 Helen Lempriere Award for her minimal sculpture ''The Hut'', derided by him as a "Wendy House". Tamanui said, "There are some people who shit in a tin. Is that really art?"

In May 2001 Tamanui, Stein, Grubb and Kouvelis were represented with 24 international groups in the London show ''Vote Stuckist'', so named because Thomson was standing as a candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001]], as a Stuckist candidate against the then-[[Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport|Culture Secretary]], [[Chris Smith, Baron Smith of Finsbury|Chris Smith]]. 

In November the Melbourne Stuckists staged a show ''Houdini to Hofmann'' at the Chiara Goya Gallery, which included some UK Stuckist work for the first time. 

Kaye Blum made a short documentary on the group, ''Art Gets Unstuck-Up''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afc.gov.au/filmsandawards/filmdbsearch.aspx?view=title&amp;title=ARTGET&amp;area=title&amp;type=Documentary&amp;genre=Cultures+-+Australian "Art gets unstuck-up"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926223353/http://afc.gov.au/filmsandawards/filmdbsearch.aspx?view=title&amp;title=ARTGET&amp;area=title&amp;type=Documentary&amp;genre=Cultures+-+Australian |date=26 September 2007 }}, [[Australian Film Commission]]. Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is structured around the artists reading lines from the Stuckists Manifesto written by Thomson and Childish. It was first shown at the ''Jaffas Down the Aisle'' film festival in Melbourne in October 2001, then in 2002 at the ''International Film Festival of Fine Art'' in Hungary and the ''Asolo Arts Film Festival'' in Italy, where it was nominated for best student short. 

In 2001, Graham Wilson, born and bred in [[Gunnedah]], [[New South Wales]], founded the second Australian group (and the first Stuckist sculpture group), the Newcastle Stuckist Stonecarvers. 

[[File:2003 Stuck in Wednesbury (1).jpg|thumb|left|Tamanui's work (painting on right) in the ''Stuck in Wednesbury'' show.]]
In December 2001, The Stuckist demonstration outside the [[Turner Prize]] at [[Tate Britain]], London, was broadcast on Australian national TV news.

In 2002, [[Godfrey Blow]] started the Perth Stuckists (Western Australia). In July, along with Melbourne Stuckists he was shown at ''The First Stuckist International'', which opened in the Stuckism Gallery, [[Shoreditch]], London. 

In March 2003, Tamanui was exhibited in ''Stuck in Wednesbury'', the Stuckists' first show in a public gallery, held in [[Wednesbury]] Museum and Art Gallery, England.

[[File:2006 The Triumph Of Stuckism.jpg|thumb|Left to right: [[Godfrey Blow]], [[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] and [[Jacqueline Jones (artist)|Jacqueline Jones]] at ''[[The Triumph of Stuckism]]'' show and symposium, [[Liverpool Biennial]] 2006.]]                                                      
In October 2002, Tamanui opened the Stuckism International Centre (Australia) with an ongoing exhibition of work, as well as the first international Stuckist show  in Australia, ''Stuck Down South'', at the FAD Gallery. This included founding Stuckists, Charles Thomson, [[Ella Guru]] and [[Sexton Ming]]. (Like the London gallery it has now ceased operating.)

In September 2004, Blow exhibited in the movement's first major show in a national museum, ''[[The Stuckists Punk Victorian]]'' at the [[Walker Art Gallery]] during the [[Liverpool Biennial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/stuckists/international/godfreyblow.asp "Godfrey Blow"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201155232/http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/walker/exhibitions/stuckists/international/godfreyblow.asp |date=1 December 2008 }}, [[Walker Art Gallery]]. Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He returned for the next Biennial there in 2006 to participate in ''[[The Triumph of Stuckism]]'' show and symposium at 68 Hope Street Gallery.

==Media coverage==

The Australian presence was first noted in an article on the Stuckists in the UK ''Observer'' Sunday newspaper in May 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Sumpter, Helen. [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/life/story/0,,220529,00.html "Go see... the Stuckists"], ''[[The Observer]]'', 14 May 2000. Retrieved 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The participation of the Australian Stuckists in the London ''Vote Stuckist'' show occasioned a double page spread by Gabriella Coslovich in the leading Melbourne paper [[The Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/melbarticle.html |title=The art of being Stuckist |author=Gabriella Coslovich |website=Stuckism.com |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It revealed a similar range of reactions to the ones the UK group had received in Britain. Melbourne painter [[David Larwill]] said, "It's the best thing I've heard in ages." Max Delaney, director of public gallery 200 Gertrude Street, accused the group of "revisionism" and "publicity and marketing". Su Baker, head of the School of Art, [[Victorian College of the Arts]], wrote it off as "a cheap shot" (the same accusation which Sir [[Nicholas Serota]] had levelled at Thomson in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/news.html#sir |title=Stuckism news |website=Stuckism.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July Stein repeated the same debate on "Coast to Coast", Channel 2 (ABC TV). 

[[File:over the oceansml.jpg|thumb|upright|''Over the ocean'' by Godfrey Blow]]  
In February 2003, [[Tracey Emin]] was interviewed in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' while in Australia:
:Of the chief YBA critics, the Stuckists, Emin cannot even speak.

:"I don't like it at all," she spat. "I don't really want to talk about it. If your wife was stalked and hounded through the media by someone she'd had a relationship with when she was 18, would you like it? That's what happened to me. I don't find it funny, I find it a bit sick, and I find it very cruel, and I just wish people would get on with their own lives and let me get on with mine." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/02/02/1044122263222.html?oneclick=true |title=Eminently outrageous |website=Ssmh.com.au |date=2003-02-03 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2003, Australian [[performance art]]ist [[Stelarc]]'s plan to have a human ear grafted onto his forearm drew virulent criticism from UK Stuckists. Melbourne Stuckist, Nigel Stein, said, "Personally, I have been an admirer of Stelarc's work for about 10 years. I would be really interested in seeing the outcome."&lt;ref&gt;Backhouse, Megan.

The same month, Kouvelis and Thomson were interviewed on ABC Radio National Australia by Francis Leach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s930236.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509091916/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s930236.htm |archivedate=9 May 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s942397.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060509091933/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s942397.htm |archivedate=9 May 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2004 Childish (who left the group in 2002) was interviewed on ABC Radio National Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s1133404.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312045309/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/arts/deepend/stories/s1133404.htm |archivedate=12 March 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2004 an article, "Breaking New Ground", appeared in the Hills Gazette, Kalamunda, Western Australia, outlining Blow's involvement in the Stuckist movement and representation at the "Stuckist Punk Victorian" exhibition at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool.

In April 2005 ''The Age'' ran a reprise of Stuckism and observed: 
{{cquote|"Stuckists have been dismissed by many as 'rebels without a cause', but their influence is, well, sticking ... The Stuckists have not beaten [[Charles Saatchi|Saatchi]], but he may be joining them."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuckism.com/zPressText/TheAge.html#PicTop |title=The Age on Stuckism |website=Stuckism.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2005, ''State of the Arts'' Australian art magazine gave a survey on the UK and Australian Stuckists, and found:
:Newcastle stone-carver Graham Wilson says he became a Stuckist because he was tired of being ignored by the main arbiters of taste and wanted to embrace the insult that he was not a real sculptor as did Childish when Emin declared he was "stuck".

In December 2005, the Stuckists demonstrated about the Tate Gallery's purchase of their trustee [[Chris Ofili]]'s work, ''[[The Upper Room (paintings)|The Upper Room]]'', wearing monkey and elephant masks, outside the Turner Prize at [[Tate Britain]] in London. A syndicated report covered the demonstration in ''The Sydney Morning Herald'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/arts/shed-wins-58000-art-prize/2005/12/06/1133631231483.html |title=Shed wins $58,000 art prize - Arts - Entertainment |website=Smh.com.au |date=2005-12-06 |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Age'', Yahoo Australia, ''ABC News Online'', ''SBS'', ''Seven'' and ''The Australian''. In June 2006 Blow supported the campaign with message board posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.wetcanvas.com/forums/showthread.php?t=317349 |title=WetCanvas |website=WetCanvas.com |date= |accessdate=2016-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UK origin==
{{main|stuckism}}
The Stuckists were founded in the [[United Kingdom]] by Charles Thomson and Billy Childish with ten other artists in 1999 to oppose conceptual art and champion painting as the radical medium of self-discovery. The name was derived by Thomson from an insult by Tracey Emin to her ex-boyfriend Childish that he was "stuck", which he had recorded in a poem. The Stuckists have since become an accepted part of the UK art scene and are studied in the educational system, but still remain largely ostracised by the art establishment for their stringent criticisms of it, particularly of the [[Young British Artists|Britart]], the [[Saatchi Gallery]] and the Turner Prize. They have also launched the period of 
[[Remodernism]]&amp;mdash;"A renewal of spirituality and meaning in art, culture and society".

==Antipodeans Group==
{{main|Antipodeans Group}}

An earlier group of seven artists in Australia (six of them Melbourne based) called the [[Antipodeans Group]] also issued a manifesto to promote modern figurative painting in opposition to the prevailing orthodoxy, which at that time was [[Abstract Expressionism]]. This was launched in a show of the artists in Melbourne in August 1959. They stated that figurative art "communicates because it has the capacity to refer to experiences that the artist shares with his audience", and that "the image, the recognizable shape, the meaningful symbol, is the basic unit of the artists' language". Like the Stuckists they were accused of conservatism and reaction.

'''''Sweet Bunch''''' ({{lang-el|Γλυκιά Συμμορία|translit=Glykia Symmoria|italic=yes}}) is a 1983 [[cinema of Greece|Greek]] dramatic [[experimental film|experimental]] [[independent film|independent]] [[underground film|underground]] [[art film]] directed by [[Nikos Nikolaidis]]. The film, produced by Vergeti Brothers and the Greek Film Center, is the second part of the "Years of Cholera" trilogy beginning with ''[[The Wretches Are Still Singing]]'' (1979) and ending with ''[[The Loser Takes It All]]'' (2002) which deals with the last decades of the twentieth century. The original Greek title directly references the Greek title of the 1969 [[Sam Peckinpah]] film ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' ({{lang-el|Άγρια Συμμορία|translit=Agria Symmoria|italic=yes}}). The film uses as background music the 1958 song "[[Sugartime]]" written by Charlie Phillips and [[Odis Echols]] as well as the 1940 song "Sweet Mara" ({{lang-el|«Γλυκιά Μαράτα,» [[romanization of Greek|tr.]] "Glykia Marata"}}) composed by Leo Rapitis to lyrics by Kostas Kofiniotis which was performed by Kakia Mendri. It was distributed by the Greek Film Center in [[Greece]] and by Restless Wind abroad.

==Plot==
A group of four misfits, Argyris, Andreas, Marina, and Sofia, live together in a house. Andreas just got out of jail. All four have become disillusioned with life and have lost any reason to live or die. They try all criminal experiences with each member of the group choosing a different activity to experiment in: frequenting expansive restaurants and leaving without paying, shoplifting, starring in pornographic films, and creating an anti-state organization. The authorities put them under surveillance, waiting for the slightest false step from any of them before acting violently. The first such misstep occurs when Sofia kills the police chief who monitors their home.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9934">'''Tactile graphics''', including '''tactile pictures''', '''tactile diagrams''', '''tactile maps''', and '''tactile graphs''', are images that use raised surfaces so that a [[Visual impairment|visually impaired]] person can feel them. They are used to convey non-textual information such as maps, paintings, graphs and diagrams.

Tactile graphics can be seen as a subset of [[accessible image]]s. Images can be made accessible to the visually impaired in various ways, such as verbal description, sound, or [[haptic perception|haptic]] (tactual) feedback.
One of the most common uses for tactile graphics is the production of tactile maps.

==Tactile maps==
[[File:Disability5 200.jpg|thumb|Paper tactile map]]
The types and forms of tactile maps began with the oldest and most rudimentary or a mixed media format. This tactile map is produced by simply attaching objects to a substrate to represent different items or symbols. More recent tactile maps are produced by computers through different means such as an ink-jet printers.

'''Thermoform''' is one of the most common methods of producing tactile maps. This process is also known as [[vacuum forming]]. Thermoform maps or plans are created from a process where a sheet of plastic is heated and vacuumed on top of a model or master. The master can be made from many substances, although certain materials are more durable than others. Since this process involves creating a mold, it is somewhat time consuming.

'''Swell paper''' has a special coating of heat-reactive chemicals. Microcapsules of alcohol implanted in the paper fracture when exposed to heat and make the surface of the paper inflate. Placing black ink on the paper prior to a heat process provides control over the raised surface areas. This type of map is not as robust as the Thermoform map, but can be produced with less effort and expense.

'''Modified [[Braille embosser]]s''' can also be used to produce tactile paper maps.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum, Don. et al. 2005. The design and manufacture of tactile maps using an ink-jet process. Journal of Engineering Design. Vol. 16, no. 6. December. pp. 525–544. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ink-jet tactile maps''' are made by layering a specially designed ink. Each layer is cured by UV irradiation before the next layer is added. This technology is an offshoot of other industries, such as circuit board manufacturing and biomedical applications.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Kafeel., McCallum, Don., &amp; Sheldon, Derek F. 2005. Multiphase Micro-Drop Interaction In Ink-jet Printing of 3D Structures for Tactile Maps. Modern Physics Letters B. Nos. 28&amp;29 pp. 1699–1702. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The substrate for tactile maps is a very important attribute, since different materials can enhance or reduce legibility and durability. Several types of substrates can be used to produce a tactile map. These include rough and smooth plastic, rough and smooth paper, microcapsule paper, Braillon, and aluminum. Many factors should be considered when choosing a [[Substrate (printing)|substrate]]; these include but are not limited to function, durability, and portability.&lt;ref&gt;Jehoel, Sandra. et al. 2005. An Evaluation of Substrates for Tactile Maps and Diagrams:
Scanning Speed and Users’ Preferences. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. February. pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tactile map variables:''' Just as [[Jacques Bertin]] retinal variables help determine how visual maps are produced; tactile maps have a formula as well. Although researchers have not standardized tactile map variables, these nine are usually included depending on the ''substrate'': vibration, flutter, pressure, temperature, size, shape, texture/grain, orientation, and elevation.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, A.L. 2002 Feeling it out : the use of haptic visualization for exploratory geographic visualization. Cartographic Perspectives, 39. pp. 12–29&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Typical tactile elevations:''' Thermoformed maps usually have an elevation of at least 1mm. Swell Paper averages 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm and braille embossers have a range from 0.25–1&amp;nbsp;mm. Ink-jet printers can be controlled to vary elevation as needed. A (2009) study conducted by Sandra Jehoel tested various height levels and estimated that preferred tactile elevations fall between 40 and 80 micrometres depending on the substrate background, shape of the object and smoothness of lines. Symbols such as a triangle, square and a circle should have a minimum base line length of 6.4, 5.0 and 5.5&amp;nbsp;mm respectively for proper recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Jehoel, Sandra. et al. 2005. An Evaluation of Substrates for Tactile Maps and Diagrams:
Scanning Speed and Users’ Preferences. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. February. pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Audio tactile maps''' or [[graphic tablet]]s are interactive devices. Electronic tactile talking touch pad instruments use [[Macromedia Flash]] software with audio files to convey information to the blind or visually impaired user. As the user’s finger engages a feature or symbol a recording provides information about the object, symbol or area. For example, the sound of splashing water can be used for areas such as rivers or oceans. This format has great potential for transmitting information over the Internet which can be downloaded to a computer or hand-held device.&lt;ref&gt;Siekierska, Eva., Muller, Anita. 2003. Tactile and Audio-tactile Maps within the Canadian Government On-Line Program. The Cartography Journal. Vol 40, 3. pp. 299–304.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A great deal of hardware already exists that can be used by the blind or visually impaired to interact with computer screen graphics. A vibrating mouse or other force feedback devices can be adapted to turn any visual software generated map into a hybrid tactile map. The interactive signal to a device can be varied when crossing a boundary or symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Golledge, Reginald G, Rice Matthew., &amp; Jacobson Denial R. 2005. A Commentary on the use of Touch for Accessing On-Screen Spatial Representations: The Process of Experiencing Haptic Maps and Graphics. The Professional Geographer. 57, 3 pp. 339–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

High resolution refreshable braille displays containing 1,500 to 12,000 pixels are already available in market. Graphic braille display available in the market is DV-2 (from KGS &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kgs-jpn.co.jp/ | title=Home of KGS Corporation|publisher=KGS Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with 1,536 pixels, Hyperbraille &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hyperbraille.de/?lang=en | title=Hyperbraille|publisher=Hyperbraille}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 7,200 pixels and TACTISPLAY Table/Walk (from Tactisplay Corp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tactisplay.com/ | title=Home of Tactisplay Corp.|publisher=Tactisplay Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) with 2,400/12,000 pixels respectively. TACTISPLAY table &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tactisplay.com/product/tactisplay-table | title=Full Page Braille Display being Launched by Tactisplay Corp.|publisher=Tactisplay Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt; has total 12,000 pixels arranged in 120x100.

'''Zoom maps''' are a recently developed tactile map. These maps are designed specifically for those who can read braille and have had no previous interaction with tactile maps. The term zoom is comparable to a zoom-able visual [[wikt: raster|raster]] internet map. A country is divided into regions on the first map then the next zoomed map will have a breakdown of the regions and so forth until a city level is reached. These successive maps rely on a dependable texture as the map zoom progresses. This produces a familiarity as one zooms from the proceeding map. This is achieved in many instances with line orientation, area and consistent shape. The Braille text on the map is placed next to a rectangular textured legend for area identification.&lt;ref&gt;Yayla, Lisa. 2009. Huseby Zoom Maps: A design Methodology for Tactile Graphics. Journal of Visual Impairment &amp; Blindness. May. pp. 270–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bang-Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War''''' is a 2000 autobiographical styled text about the [[Bang-Bang Club]], a group of four South African photographers active within the townships of [[South Africa]] during the [[apartheid]] period, particularly between 1990 and 1994. The journalists were [[Kevin Carter]], [[Greg Marinovich]], [[Ken Oosterbroek]], and [[João Silva (photographer)|João Silva]]. The book was co-authored by two of the journalists, [[Greg Marinovich]] and [[João Silva (photographer)|João Silva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldpressphoto.org/people/joao-silva|title=The Bang-Bang Club, a factual account of news photographers in South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the years between 1990 and 1994 the fight from apartheid to democracy in South Africa was extremely  violent.  About the members of the Bang Bang Club was much written at this time and later too.  But the stories painted  a picture "of a group of hard-living men wo worked, played and hung out together pretty much all of the time", how Greg Marinovich wrote in the preface of the book. The next sentence started with the words: "Let us set the record straight: …" In 1997 started Marinovich and Joao Silva to write the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Marinovich|first1= Greg|author-link1= Greg Marinovich|last2= Silva|first2= João|author-link2= João Silva (photographer)|date= 20 September 2000|title= The Bang-Bang Club: Snapshots from a Hidden War|url= https://books.google.se/books?id=_6cyzX7DzYkC&amp;dq|chapter=Preface|location= New York, N.Y.|publisher= Basic Books|isbn= 0-465-04413-1|id= {{LIBRIS|4962156}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the acknowledgments were mentioned the many ''Impimpi'' – informants who contributed to the book. ''Impimpi'' is a Zulu word and in the glossary of the book it is translated as "spy". These 45 people, the parents of Kevin Carter also, helped Marinovich and Silva to write the book "straight". [[Judith Matloff]], also listed under ''impimpi'', wrote in an article: "But the reporters and photographers stationed in South Africa at the time were also compassionate human beings who exposed themselves to danger because they wanted to record history".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cjr.org/review/bang_bang_off_target.php|first=Judith|last=Matloff|title=Bang Bang Off Target| publisher=Columbia Journalism Review, CJR|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other witnesses or impimpi for the book from that era include: [[James Nachtwey]], [[Peter Magubane]], [[Ken Oosterbroek#Death|Brian Mkhize]], [[Gilles Peress]], [[Jo%C3%A3o Silva (photographer)#Personal life| Vivian Silva]], and more.

The book was first published in January 2000 by William Heinemann, London, UK and then by Basic Books, New York. It was translated into Polish, Portuguese, Spanish and  2015 into German. It is published in 19 Editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/work/editions/263261-the-bang-bang-club-snapshots-from-a-hidden-war|title=The Bang-Bang Club Snapshots From a Hidden War published in 19 Editions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of his review Niranjan Karnik wrote: "I have several concerns about the future of this profession".&lt;ref name="karnik"/&gt; He expressed that conflict journalist need a "debriefing" after the experience in a conflict or war zone "akin to what the International Committee of the Red Cross requires of its fieldworkers". The usefulness of the book is for him: "Its overall value is not as much in its use as source of history, but in how it openly exposes the way journalists suffer in the course of their work, and the heavy ethical and moral questions they face on an daily basis."

Karnik wrote that "Students of the media and aspiring journalists will find special value and significance in this book, for its unsparing and often graphic portrayal of events in South Africa."

The moral and ethical questions are central themes in the book. Karnik discuss the themes in the example of the [[The vulture and the little girl|noted photograph]] by Kevin Carter.

{{Cquote|Carter, for example, won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for a photograph of a starving child that he took in south sudan in 1993. The famous photograph shows a small, emaciated girl curled over in exhaustion while a vulture sits a short distance away on the ground next to her. The photograph became the cover image for many humanitarian groups in their fundraising appeals. It also raised ethical questions about the limits that journalists will go to get an image.}}

Karnik explains that the book "lacks the academic and critical analysis", which he is used to write as an author and which he reads in his profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Niranjan_Karnik|title=Author Karnik}}&lt;/ref&gt; But newertheless he wrote that the book: "as a perspective into the dynamics of wartime reporting it is valuable".

== Film adaptation ==
In 2010, the Canadian director [[Steven Silver (film director)|Steven Silver]] released a [[film adaptation]] of the book as a full-feature film also entitled ''[[The Bang Bang Club (film)|The Bang Bang Club]]''.

'''''The Bride of Abydos''''' (French - ''La Fiancée d'Abydos'') or ''Selim and Zuleika'' is the title of two works by [[Eugène Delacroix]], one in the [[Museum of Fine Arts of Lyon]] (pre-1849) and another in the [[Louvre]] (1843-1849).

Both works show the characters Selim and Zuleika from [[The Bride of Abydos|the poem of the same name]] by [[Lord Byron]], written after he had swum the Hellespont between Abydos and Sestos in imitation of [[Leander (mythology)|Leander]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3424">'''''The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner''''' is a five-line poem by [[Randall Jarrell]] published in 1945.  It is about the death of a [[air gunner|gunner]] in a [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry]] [[ball turret]] on a World War II [[United States Air Force|American]] [[bomber]] aircraft.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
From my mother's sleep I fell into the State,
And I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.
Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,
I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.
When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                  
Jarrell, who served in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]], provided the following explanatory note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A [[ball turret]] was a [[Plexiglas]] sphere set into the belly of a [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] or [[B-24]], and inhabited by two .50 caliber machine guns and one man, a short small man. When this gunner tracked with his machine guns a fighter attacking his bomber from below, he revolved with the turret; hunched upside-down in his little sphere, he looked like the fetus in the womb [in fact, the ball-turret gunner sat upright, if in an uncomfortable position. In a real foetus he would be in a [[Breech birth|breech position]], even more vulnerable to the foetus]. The fighters which attacked him were armed with cannon firing explosive shells. The hose was a steam hose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewer Leven M. Dawson says that "The theme of Randall Jarrell's 'The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner' is that institutionalized violence, or war, creates moral paradox, a condition in which acts repugnant to human nature become appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;Leven M. Dawson. [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/jarrell/turret.htm from The Explicator 31.4 (December 1972)], Item #29.&lt;/ref&gt; Most commentators agree, calling the poem a condemnation of the dehumanizing powers of "the State", which are most graphically exhibited by the violence of war.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Horner. [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/jarrell/turret.htm from ''The Explicator'' 36.4 (Summer 1978)], pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due partly to its short length, "The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner" poem has been widely anthologized.  In fact, Jarrell came to fear that his reputation would come to rest on it alone.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte H. Beck. [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/jarrell/turret.htm from ''Worlds and Lives: The Poetry of Randall Jarrell'']. 1983. Associated Faculty Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem inspired the play, "The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner" by Anna Moench, which premiered in New York City at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2008 and was extended to play at The Space in Long Island City. A nod to the poem can also be found in [[John Irving]]'s 1978 novel ''[[The World According to Garp]],'' in which the protagonist's father died from a "rather careless lobotomy" by enemy gunfire while serving as a ball-turret gunner in World War II.

'''''The Glo Friends''''' is a [[television series]] based on the [[Glo Friends]] toyline, originally aired in 1986 as a segment of ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony 'n Friends]]'', that only lasted one season (26 segments were made in total). ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]'' aired the first 15 minutes, and the second half rotated among ''[[MoonDreamers]]'', ''[[Potato Head Kids]]'', and ''Glo Friends''. The show was made by [[Sunbow Entertainment|Sunbow Productions]] and [[Marvel Productions]]. It rebroadcast on [[Freeform (TV channel)|(CBN) Family Channel]] (known today as Freeform) from 1989 to 1995 during ''[[My Little Pony (TV series)|My Little Pony]]''.

The Glo Friends toyline, which preceded the television show, are small [[phosphorescence|glow-in-the-dark]] toys in the shape of [[insect]]s and other small creatures (including the original [[Glo Worm]]) that were made by [[Hasbro]]'s [[Playskool]] division in the mid-1980s ([[Glo Worm]] was introduced in 1982). Books were also made by [[Ladybird Books|Ladybird]] to accompany each Glo Friend.

==Premise==
The title protagonists in ''The Glo Friends'' were a community of small, glow-in-the-dark bugs that live in Glo Land, a magical kingdom located in the middle of a forest. Their homes are built near the Glo Pond, from where they harvest a substance known as Moondrops. It is Moondrops that sustain the Glo Friends and enable their ability to glow in the dark.

The Glo Friends peaceful existence is threatened constantly by the Moligans, a group of [[Mole (animal)|mole]]-like creatures led by Starnose. The Moligans were banished from the kingdom of Moleslavia by King Mole for various crimes including unlawful digging, mob action, robbery, looting and cheating. Since their banishment, the Moligans have been living underground and planning revenge against King Mole. Since the Moligans are [[Myopia|short-sighted]], they were unsuccessful in harvesting gold from the nearby mines. As such, the Moligans have attempted to enslave the Glo Friends to power their lanterns, which would enable them to see in the mines, harvest the gold and buy out the kingdom of Moleslavia.

==Characters==

===Glo Friends===
* '''Baby Glo Worm''' (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) - She is the youngest member of the Glo Friends community. She is seen spending most of her time along Glo Grannybug (see below). She is quite curious and often giggles. She also speaks, but only in short sentences. In the debut episode of the Glo Friends TV show ''Baby Glo Worm goes Bye-Bye'', she escaped from her bed while the other Glo Friends were trying to sing a lullaby to make her sleep, and consequently got lost in the Moligans´ Tunnels, putting the other Glo Friends into trouble when they set off to find her.
* '''Garden [[Ant]]''' - He spends his time taking care of his plants and flowers. He cultivates vegetables for the Glo Friend community, and has a vast knowledge about them. He can't tolerate seeing the Moligans eating the roots of a tree, as seen in the episodes ''Forest Brigade'' (in which he protects his personal tree) and even in ''Easy Money'' Pt. 2 when a Moleslavian villager is selling "Root dogs" (like Hot Dogs with roots instead of sausages). He is a regular character in the TV series. His house is a sort of pumpkin located in Glo Land.
** '''Bunny Rabbit''' - A [[rabbit]] who is Garden Ant's best friend.
* '''Glo Bashfulbug''' - As her name indicates, Glo Bashfulbug is a female Glo Friend that doesn't know what to say in certain moments. Sometimes, she shows an attraction for Glo Worm, one of the bravest and smartest Glo Friends. In more than one moment, she said to Glo Worm that being brave is hard. She is a regular character in the TV series.
* '''Glo [[Bed bug|Bedbug]]''' - She is the laziest of the Glo Friends. The only things she usually wants to do is eating, singing, and sleeping. Sometimes, she plays.
* '''Glo Bonnie [[Beetle]]''' - She is another female Glo Friend. According to her description, she is very sweet. She doesn't appear in the TV series.
* '''Glo Bookbug''' -
* '''Glo Bopbug''' - He is an eight-legged Glo Friend that wears a top hat and shoes, and uses a cane. He is a regular character in the TV series. He likes to dance. In the Spanish dub of the show, he was called "Abuelete", literally translated as "Granddaddy"
* '''Glo [[Butterfly]]''' - She carries a magic wand. She believes that she can do magic tricks, although she actually can't. In the episode ''Make no mistake, it's magic'', the other Glo Friends said that it is better not to tell her that her "magic tricks" are just coincidences, in order to keep her happy.
* '''Glo Bug''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) - He is sometimes considered the bravest of the Glo Friends. He is not afraid of danger. For example, in the first part of ''The Quest'', he can't tolerate that Rook and the Red Ant army are destroying the forest and for that reason, without wasting time thinking, he dares to run into Rook and face him. For some reason, in the TV series and in his Playskool-Hasbro figure, his hat is pink, while in other media, such as the Ladybird books, his hat has multicoloured strips.
* '''Glo Cappy''' (voiced by [[Russi Taylor]]) - He loves going to explore the forests riding on Country Mouse and acts as a reporter of Glo Land. He informs the others about the dangers or anything worth to mention. He and his friend wear a blue cap.
** '''Country Mouse''' - A [[mouse]] who is Glo Cappy's best friend.
* '''Glo Clutterbug''' - He is a clumsy insect that usually messes up the situation, and puts the other Glo Friends into trouble. He often falls into traps.
* '''Glo [[Cricket (insect)|Cricket]]''' -
* '''Glo Doodlebug''' (voiced by [[Will Ryan]]) - He loves art. He often gets frustrated when he feels that his artworks or his painting style are not appreciated. In the episode "The Masterpiece," Glo Doodlebug decides to leave Glo Land in order to go to a cave (accompanied by Snugbug) that he uses as a personal studio. He is a regular character in the TV series.
* '''Glo [[Firefly]]''' - He has a name that has double-meaning: his job is being a [[firefighter]] and he is a firefly. He doesn't appear in the TV series.
* '''Glo Flutterbug''' - His figure was only available through mail order as Glo Prayerbug. He doesn't appear in the TV series.
* '''Glo Grannybug''' - She is the wisest and oldest Glo Friend. She lives in the biggest treehouse of Glo Land. She often tells stories to the other Glo Friends and she is often seen taking care of Baby Glo Worm. She also loves celebrating parties with homemade food at the Full Moon Days, in which Moondrops falls to the Earth, as seen for examples in the episode "Beware the Tales of Gold."
* '''Glo Hopper''' - He is a green-bodied [[grasshopper]] who is usually seen riding on Glo Turtle. He tends to jump high under several circumstances, including surprise, happiness, etc.
** '''Glo Turtle''' - A [[turtle]] who is Glo Hopper's best friend.
* '''Glo [[Horse-fly|Horsefly]]''' -
* '''Glo Nuttybug''' -
* '''Glo Prayerbug''' - She is a blue [[mantis]]-shaped Glo Friend that, as her name indicates, prays when something goes wrong. She appeared very few times in the TV show (only in the 10-part adventure ''The Quest'' and in ''The Glo Friends save Christmas'' special) and she had only very few lines. Her toy figure was only available in the US and Canada by mail order.
* '''Glo Scuttlebug''' (voiced by [[Mona Marshall]]) - He is a skypilot that rides on Dragonflyer. He is a regular character in the TV series.
** '''Dragonflyer''' - A [[dragonfly]] who is Glo Shuttlebug's best friend that acts as a plane.
* '''Glo Skunkbug''' - He is a stinking Glo Friend with purple nose (Most of the other Glo Friends have a red nose). He is a very close friend of Glo Clutterbug.
* '''Glo Sluggerbug''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) - He wears a baseball cap and always carry a stick. He is very brave and in several moments he and his frog friend have excellent ideas when fighting against their enemies. He is a regular character in the TV series. The only moment in which he was seen playing a baseball match with the other Glo Friends was in the episode ''Bean Ball''.
** '''Bullyfrog''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]) - A [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]] who is Glo Sluggerbug's best friend.
* '''Glo [[Snail]]''' (voiced by [[Don Messick]]) -
* '''Glo Sniffles Snail''' - He has a constant cold. He doesn't appear in the TV series.
* '''Glo Snugbug''' - She is a pink caterpillar-shaped Glo Friend. She is not a regular character in the TV series. She only appeared during the 10-part episode ''The Quest'' and ''The Masterpiece'', in which she seemed to show feelings for Glo Doodlebug. She tends to hug all his friends.
* '''Glo [[Spider]]''' -
* '''Glo Tootlebug''' -
* '''Glo [[Nepomorpha|Waterbug]]''' - Glo Waterbug is a sailor insect. He guards the Glo Moondrops Pond with Dipper Duck.
** '''Dipper Ducky''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) - A [[duck]] who is Glo Waterbug's best friend. He guards Glo Moondrops Pond with Dipper Duck.
* '''Glo Worm''' (voiced by [[Pat Fraley]]) - He is the original Glo Friend, and is the unofficial leader of the Glo Friends in the TV series. He is quite brave and smart. He wears purple pyjamas, although the original [[Glo Worm]] toy portrays him as wearing green pyjamas. This was a source of some controversy.

===Glo Wees===
A race of [[Fairy|fairies]] that can glow like the Glo Friends. They are known to be nature's helpers:

* '''Dapple''' -
* '''Nippin''' -
* '''Nutcap''' (voiced by [[Hal Rayle]]) - A Glo Wee that carries around the Book of Nature which enables him to communicate with nature.
* '''Posey''' (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) -
* '''Spruce''' - A Glo Wee who is an expert juggler.
* '''Willow''' - A Glo Wee who conducts the symphony of nature.

===Villains===
* '''Moligans''' - The Moligans are the primary antagonists of the series. After being banished from Moleslavia for their crimes, they sought to start their mine and mine for gold in order to get enough to buy out Moleslavia. To accomplish this, they always try to target the Glo Friends to power their lanterns with no success.
** '''Starnose''' (voiced by [[Roger C. Carmel]]) - Starnose is the leader of the Moligans. He is physically tough and it is mentioned that he is able to scare anyone who tries to ignore his orders. In the Spanish dub of the Glo Friends TV Show, he was called "Narizotas", literally translated as "Big Nose".
** '''Nails''' (voiced by [[Susan Silo]]) - Nails is a selfish and egocentrical Moligan lady that only worries about her physical appearance or anything in her own benefit. She likes valuable and shining body complements (such as rings, necklaces, earrings, bracelets, etc.) and she doesn't tolerate that anyone calls her an "ugly witch" (or similar attributions). She seems to have an attraction to Starnose, and can often be seen clinging to him, but that may just be her trying to get close to the main power of the group. She also serves as the [[Cook (profession)|cook]] of the Moligans as seen in "Wizard of Rook."
** '''Old Moldy''' (voiced by [[Roger C. Carmel]]) - As his name indicates, Old Moldy is the oldest Moligan in the group. He needs to use a hammer-shape cane due to his old age and has seen a lot of things in his youth. Since he was young, his main dream was to melt a piece of gold to turn it in a huge river of gold. In the episode "Caverns of Mystery," his old mine was seen.
** '''Excavator''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) - Excavator is the second oldest Moligan in the group. He is a [[scientist]] that usually remains in his personal laboratory doing chemical experiments or inventing new mining artifacts such as the Bi-Pedal Turbo Tunneler (seen in two episodes of the TV show). In the Spanish dub of the TV series, he was called "Inventor".
** '''Brasher''' (voiced by [[Hal Rayle]]) - Brasher is a tall and intellectual Moligan. It is said that he has the best ideas about how to get the gold and the Glo Friends, but Starnose hears and takes them as they were of his own to consider himself as the "main brain of the Moligans".
** '''Smasher''' (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) - Smasher is Brasher's brother. Unlike Brasher, Smasher is (or acts as) stupid and dumb. Physically, he is tall and tough. He feels the need of "smashing" at least one Glo Friend (during the 10-part episode ''The Quest'', he is seen several times trying to damage the Glo Friends in order to force them to work for the Moligans).
** '''Scoop''' (voiced by [[Nancy Cartwright]]) - Scoop is the youngest Moligan. She is also the only nice Moligan, often secretly sabotaging Starnose's plots, and is friends with the Glo Friends, but fears to leave the Moligans. She wears tight clothing and has a tall auburn hairdo and a braided ponytail.
** '''Tumbler''' - Tumbler is the shortest Moligan. He is also lazy, doing as little digging as possible, and is very gullible, often taking throwaway comments at face value.
* '''Rook''' (voiced by [[Hal Rayle]]) - Rook is a [[Corvus (genus)|crow]] who used to work for Lord Driver of the Red Ant Army. After Driver left, the Moligans enlisted Rook as a spy and lookout. He has little love for his employers, once even dishing out the dirt on them to the Glo Friends newspaper.
* '''The Red [[Ant]] Army''' - They are a group of insects in a desert valley and Rook's former employers. They are led by '''Lord Driver''' (voiced by [[Frank Welker]]). They only appeared in "The Quest" in which they captured the Moligans and Glo Friends. It was because of them that the Moligans learned of the Glo Friends and their illumination abilities. Due to a breakout of the Moligans and the Glo Friends, Lord Driver and the Red Ant Army took flight when their kingdom ended up having a cave-in.
* '''Blanche''' (voiced by [[Sally Struthers]]) – The Wicked [[Witchcraft|Witch]] of the North Pole. Dressed in purple fur, she appears on the Christmas special along with her live [[weasel]] furry scarf (voiced by [[Charlie Adler]]) and had an icicle wand. She trapped [[Santa Claus]] and his DearDeers ([[reindeer]]) in an ice cage in a plot to stop Christmas.
===Others===
* '''The Jester brothers''' (voiced by unknown) – They are pink court jesters for the Red Ant Army. The Jester brothers are just Gag characters and they only appeared in the episode: "The Quest" and "Easy Money part 1 &amp; 2".
