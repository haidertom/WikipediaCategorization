An '''advance reading copy''', '''advance review copy''', '''advance reader's edition''', '''advance copy''', or a '''reader's edition''' ('''ARC''' or '''ARE''') is a free copy of a new [[book]] given by a publisher to booksellers, librarians, journalists, celebrities, or others, or as a contest or school prize,&lt;ref name="ltblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.librarything.com/blogs/librarything/2007/05/page/2/|title=Archive for May, 2007|work=The Librarything Blog|accessdate=25 February 2012|author=Tim|date=May 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519130920/http://www.librarything.com/blog/2007_05_01_archive.php|archivedate=May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; before the book is printed for mass distribution.

==Overview==
ARCs may lack the final [[dust jacket]], formatting, and binding of the finished product. The text of an advance edition may also differ slightly from the market book (the final version that is distributed for sale), because changes may be made after advance readers make comments or find errors in the manuscript. When a celebrity reader or journalist gives an endorsement, that may be added to the dust-cover and other promotional items.

ARCs are normally distributed three to six months before the book is officially released to reviewers, bookstores, magazines, and (in some cases) libraries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Book collectors often seek ARCs, which may contain text errors or typos that add value, as coins or stamps with errors do.

On rare occasions (for instance, on the publication of an eagerly awaited or controversial book), a publisher may require the recipients of an ARC to sign a [[Confidentiality agreement|confidentiality of content agreement]]. However, in most cases the sheer number of ARCs produced and distributed makes that impractical. A typical genre publisher will produce 5,000 ARCs for a new book by a moderately popular writer.&lt;ref name="ltblog"/&gt;

Before it was a common practice to produce and distribute ARCs in this way, publishers used uncorrected, bound [[galley proof]]s only for the editing and proof-reading process. Typically, they were bound in plain paper covers without illustrations, printed in black and white, and significantly larger than their market book counterparts. In contrast, ARCs usually are printed in full color, and have bindings, format, and illustrations that are similar to those of the market book. The phrase 'uncorrected proof' appears on the ARC cover.

Although ARCs are usually free promotional items, some early versions of books, even some labeled by the publisher as ARCs, are sold to the public. An example is ''[[Captain Vorpatril's Alliance]]'' by [[Lois McMaster Bujold]].

==Digital advance copies==

Publishers who produce galley proofs in electronic form rather than as a physical book do not use them as ARCs. However, with the rise of ebooks and ereaders, it is now common for ARCs (in contrast to galley proofs) to be distributed as [[EBook|eBooks]] on websites such as NetGalley. Both traditionally published and self-published ARCs may be available for distribution on such sites. Recently, '''eARC''' has come into common use for advance copies of eBooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lili|title=The In’s and Out’s of NetGalley|url=http://blog.netgalley.com/guest-post-the-ins-and-outs-of-netgalley/|website=NetGalley|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage dates back to at least 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=eBooks and Advanced Reading Copies (eARCs)|url=https://bitethebook.com/2010/11/10/ebooks-and-advanced-reading-copies-earcs/|website=Bite The Book|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was promoted by [[Baen Books]] for their trade eBooks from at least 2013 onward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ebooks beta|url=https://ebooks.stackexchange.com/questions/235/are-baen-earc-editions-generally-very-different-from-final-published-books|website=Stack Exchange|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amar Jawan Jyoti''' ({{lang-hi|अमर जवान ज्योति}}) (English translation: ''Flame of the immortal soldier'') is an Indian [[memorial]] constructed after the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]] to commemorate the martyred and unknown soldiers of the [[Indian Armed Forces]] who died during the war. The memorial was constructed in December 1971 and inaugurated by [[Indira Gandhi]] in 1972. Amar Jawan Jyoti is located under [[India Gate]] at [[Rajpath]] in [[New Delhi]] and consists of a marble pedestal on which a [[cenotaph]] is situated. "Amar Jawan" (Immortal Soldier) is scripted in gold on all four sides of the cenotaph and on top, a [[L1A1 self-loading rifle]] stands on its barrel with a helmet of the Unknown Soldier on top. The pedestal is bound by four urns, one of which holds a continuously burning flame.

==History==
From 3 December 1971 to 16 December 1971 ([[Fall of Dhaka]]), India had a military confrontation with [[Pakistan]] ([[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]) during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War|liberation war]] in [[East Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="India-Pakistan 1971 war"&gt;{{cite news|title=India-Pakistan 1971 war|work=[[The Indian Express]]|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/explained/india-pakistan-1971-war-bangladesh-indira-gandhi-4429236/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creation of Bangladesh]] was assisted by India during which many Indian soldiers lost their lives.&lt;ref name="Amar Jyoti"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amar Jyoti|publisher=discoveredindia.com|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.discoveredindia.com/delhi/attractions/samadhis/amar-jyoti.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1971, after the ''Indo-Pakistani War of 1971'', [[Indira Gandhi]] (then [[Prime Minister of India]]) helped pay to construct the ''Amar Jawan Jyoti'' under the [[India Gate]] to commemorate the dead and unknown soldiers who died invading Pakistan. On 26 January 1972 (23rd Republic Day of India), the monument was officially inaugurated by Indira Gandhi.&lt;ref name="Amar Jyoti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amar Jawan Jyoti"&gt;{{cite news|title=Amar Jawan Jyoti|publisher=indiagate.org.in|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.indiagate.org.in/amar-jawan-jyoti.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1972, every-year on the [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]] (before the [[Delhi Republic Day parade|Republic Day parade]]), it has been customary for the [[President of India|President]], [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], [[Chief of the Air Staff (India)|Chief of the Air Staff]], [[Chief of the Naval Staff (India)|Chief of the Naval Staff]], [[Chief of the Army Staff (India)|Chief of the Army Staff]] and dignitaries to place [[wreath]] at ''Amar Jawan Jyoti'' and pay homage to the dead and unknown soldiers.&lt;ref name="Amar Jyoti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amar Jawan Jyoti"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Significance of Amar Jawan Jyoti"&gt;{{cite news|title=Significance of Amar Jawan Jyoti|publisher=indiagate.org.in|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.indiagate.org.in/articles/significance-of-amar-jawan-jyoti.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite news|title=History|publisher=indiagate.org.in|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.indiagate.org.in/history.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main structure (India Gate) was originally constructed in 1921 by [[Edwin Lutyens]]. Amar Jawan Jyoti was added under the India Gate in 1971.&lt;ref name="The India Gate"&gt;{{cite news|title=The India Gate|publisher=thedivineindia.com|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.thedivineindia.com/the-india-gate/5784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and structure==
[[File:Soldier guarding Amar Jawan Jyoti.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Indian Army]] soldier guarding ''Amar Jawan Jyoti''.]]
Amar Jawan Jyoti is located under [[India Gate]] at [[Rajpath]] in [[New Delhi]]. It consists of a marble pedestal on which a [[cenotaph]] is situated. "Amar Jawan" (Immortal Soldier) is scripted in gold on all four sides of the cenotaph and on top, a [[L1A1 self-loading rifle]] is placed on its barrel and is capped by a helmet of the Unknown Soldier.

Each of the four urns has a flame but only one of the four flames burns throughout the year; on [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]] and [[Republic Day (India)|Republic Day]]s, all flames are lit simultaneously.&lt;ref name="5 things about Amar Jawan Jyoti"&gt;{{cite news|title=5 things about Amar Jawan Jyoti|publisher=thebetterindia.com|accessdate=4 January 2017|url=http://www.thebetterindia.com/43484/amar-jawan-jyoti-republic-day-delhi/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Amar Jawan Jyoti'' is manned [[24/7 service|24/7]] by soldiers from the [[Indian Army|Army]], [[Indian Air Force|Air Force]] and the [[Indian Navy]].&lt;ref name="5 things about Amar Jawan Jyoti"/&gt;

==Significance==
Constructed after the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971, the ''Amar Jawan Jyoti'' commemorates the dead and unknown soldiers who lost their lives in the conflict, that resulted in the creation of independent Bangladesh&lt;ref name="Significance of Amar Jawan Jyoti"/&gt; The burning flame is considered immortal.&lt;ref name="Amar Jawan Jyoti"/&gt;

'''Arts in ''Second Life''''' is an artistic area of a 3D social network (called ''[[Second Life]]'') that has served, since 2003, as a platform for various artistic pursuits and exhibitions. SL Photography is one of the most popular forms of artistic expression with images known as "snapshots" produced while travelling through ''Second Life''{{'}}s virtual environment. Many of these snapshots are displayed through various mediums that include Art Galleries, [[Machinima]] websites and Second Life Magazines.

== Art exhibits ==
Second Life has created an environment where artists can display their works to an audience across the world. This has created an entire artistic culture where many residents display art in the museums, galleries and homes they can buy or build using Second Life's powerful tools. Gallery openings even allow art patrons to "meet" and socialize with exhibiting artists and has even led to many real life sales.

Numerous art gallery simulations (called "sims") abound in Second Life. Among the more popular galleries are the Sisse Singhs Art Gallery, the Windlight art Gallery and the  Horus Art Gallery. Among the most notable of these was the art gallery sim Cetus Gallery District, the world's first virtual online urban arts district. Cetus was modeled on real world analogs such as New York's Chelsea gallery district as a mixed-use arts community of virtual galleries, offices, loft apartments, and coffee houses. Its many tenant-run businesses featured weekly live music performances, gallery openings, and literary events such as the virtual book launch for "Coming of Age in Second Life: An Anthropologist Explores the Virtually Human," by Tom Boellstorf (Princeton University Press; 2008). Cetus was chosen Best Cultural Site in Second Life in 2007, and its creator avatar Xander Ruttan (real world arts professional Aaron Collins of California), was among the most influential art world avatars in SL. Cetus resulted in many ongoing collaborative efforts among the SL community of artists, designers, writers, and virtual builders from across the real and virtual worlds. (Cetus was later bought by virtual artist DB Bailey and converted into a personal art project).

The modeling tools from ''Second Life'' allow the artists also to create new forms of art that in many ways are not possible in real life due to physical constraints or high associated costs. The virtual arts are visible in over 2050 "museums" (according to SL's own search engine).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/sundayarts/thursdays/ |title=Thursdays |accessdate = 2007-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Haydn Shaughnessy, [[real life]] gallerist, along with his wife Roos Demol hired a [[real life]] architect, [[New York City|New York]] based, Benn Dunkley to design a gallery in Second Life. Dunkleys goal was to design an interactive gallery with art in mind in a virtual world. "Ten Cubed" is a radical departure in art exhibition, a futuristically designed gallery showcasing art in a unique setting. On January 31, 2008, "Ten Cubed" was launched. 
For its [[inaugural]] exhibition, ''Crossing the Void II'', owner and curator Shaughnessy selected five artists working in and with modern technologies. These artists included Chris Ashley based in [[Oakland, California]], [[Jon Coffelt]] based in [[New York, New York]], Claire Keating based in [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]], Scott Kildall based in [[San Francisco, California]] and [[Nathaniel Stern]] originally based in [[New York, New York]] now in [[Dublin, Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.depoconsulting.com/blog/?p=16 Inaugural artists in ''Crossing the Void II''for "Ten Cubed," curated by Haydn Shaughnessy]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Real life]] as well as Second Life editions are available from the gallery.

The virtual creations from the [[metaverse]] are disclosed in real life by initiatives such as Fabjectory (statuettes)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fabjectory.com/secondlife/ |title=Fabjectory |accessdate = 2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Secondlife-Art.com (oil paintings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.secondlife-art.com/| title= Secondlife-Art.com: real life paintings from Second Life| accessdate= 2007-03-02| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070213084658/http://www.secondlife-art.com/#| archivedate= 2007-02-13| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007 the huge gallery called crossworlds gallery opened its doors in Secondlife; therefore,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallery.de |title=crossworlds gallery at gallery.de |date=2007-04-15 |accessdate=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; the aim was to create an open space for art in virtual worlds. Also in 2007, artists Adam Nash, Christopher Dodds and [[Justin Clemens]] won a A$20,000 Second Life Artists in Residence grant&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/the_arts/features/australias_first_second_life_arts_residency |title=Australia's first Second Life arts residency - Australia Council for the Arts |publisher=Australiacouncil.gov.au |accessdate=2010-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311224257/http://www.australiacouncil.gov.au/the_arts/features/australias_first_second_life_arts_residency |archivedate=2010-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/technology/theyre-virtually-famous/2008/04/10/1207856776808.html?s_cid=rss_technology |title=They're virtually famous - Technology |publisher=theage.com.au |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mahesh Sharma |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/arts/old-funds-for-new-worlds/story-e6frg8n6-1111116470411 |title=Old funds for new worlds |publisher=The Australian |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Australia Council for the Arts]].

In 2008, the French Artist Fred Forest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webnetmuseum.org/html/en/expo-retr-fredforest/actions/70_a_en.htm#text |title=Web Net Museum-Fred forest-Retrospective-Art sociologique-Esthetique de la communication-Interrogation-Oeuvres Actions-Les robinets planetaires |publisher=Webnetmuseum.org |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; had entered the virtual world of Second Life to show his art project for the first time in his country. He inaugurated his "Experimental Center of the Territory of M2" ("Centre expérimental du terrioire du M2"), where he invited politicians to discuss about sustainable development and digital identity card ( Capucine.net). In another art project, he discussed about art institutions in France in his action called "l'art de la corrida".

== Live music ==
Live music performances in ''Second Life'' takes place in three distinctly different ways;
* With in-world voice chat, where the user dons a headset and microphone then enables a Second Life browse to "broadcast" his voice to other users, much like a telephone conference call.
* With streaming, where vocal and instrumental music by ''Second Life'' residents can be provided with the aid of Internet broadcast software, such as Shoutcast. This is input, via microphones, instruments or other audio sources, into computer audio interfaces and streamed live to audio servers. Similar to webcast radio, the audio stream from the live performance can be received in ''Second Life'' for the enjoyment of other Residents on their computer speakers. This started with performances by Astrin Few in May 2004 and began to gain popularity mid-2005. For example, the UK band Passenger performed on the Menorca Island in mid-2006. Another UK band, [[Redzone]], toured in ''Second Life'' in February 2007.
* With inworld samples, where sounds samples are uploaded and an inworld user interface – instruments – is made to trigger those. Unlike streaming, performing with inworld samples make use of the ''Second Life'' environment and creates a three-dimensional sound experience to the audience. The [[Avatar Orchestra Metaverse]] is the most prolific representative with this approach.

Linden Lab added an Event Category "Live Music" in March 2006 to accommodate the increasing number of scheduled events. By the beginning of 2008, scheduled live music performance events in ''Second Life'' spanned every musical genre, and included hundreds of live musicians and DJs who perform on a regular basis. A typical day in ''Second Life'' will feature dozens of live music performances.

In 2008 the UK act [[Redzone]] announced they would release their new live album only via Second Life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=30314_0_2_1_C |title=New Redzone live album only available in Second Life |publisher=Side-line.com |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Redzone]] also began choreographing and synchronising their performances via MIDI in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redzone.tv/redzone/press/news/2008.htm |title=MIDI-to-SecondLife Synchronisation Perfected |publisher=Redzone.tv |accessdate=2010-02-19}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many amateur performers start their music careers in Second Life by performing at virtual karaoke bars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-18485 |title=Of Avatars and Microphones |publisher=Ireport.com |date=2008-05-03 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Open Mic, then progress to performing for "pay", or Linden dollars, in-world.

== Filming with machinima ==

[[File:Machinima sample reindeer full size.ogg|thumb|right|Film made in Second Life using [[machinima]].]]

''Second Life'' is popular for filming with [[machinima]]. Virtual worlds can contain all aspects of real world filming techniques as well as many more not possible in the real world. It is far easier to create 3D objects in ''Second Life'' and film them than create them from 'scratch' using traditional [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] software.
There are many machinima and performing arts groups that are active in ''Second Life'' and which participate in creative events such as the annual 48 Hour Film Project. There are also several machinima groups that actively promote the works of Second Life artists such as Machinima Mondays, Rezzed TV, MAGE Magazine and the Machinima Artist's guild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Theater ==
Live theater is presented in ''Second Life''. The [[SL Shakespeare Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slshakespeare.com/ |title=The SL Shakespeare Company: Homepage |publisher=Slshakespeare.com |accessdate=2008-10-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081031212730/http://slshakespeare.com/| archivedate= 31 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; performed an act from ''Hamlet'' live in February 2008. In 2009, the company produced scenes from ''[[Twelfth Night]]''.

In 2007 Johannes von Matuschka and Daniel Michelis developed Wunderland, an interactive SL theatre play at Schaubühne am Lehniner Platz in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slwunderland.wordpress.com |title=Wunderland |publisher=Slwunderland.wordpress.com |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, HBO hosted a comedy festival in ''Second Life,''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3pointd.com/20070228/hbo-comedy-festival-coming-to-second-life/ |title=HBO Comedy Festival Coming to Second Life |publisher=3pointd.com |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2010-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707064015/http://www.3pointd.com/20070228/hbo-comedy-festival-coming-to-second-life/# |archive-date=2011-07-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; using live streaming audio. In March 2009, SL residents staged a two-day Virtually Funny Comedy Festival to "help build awareness for Comic Relief, Red Nose Day 2009 and of course, comedy in Second Life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ireport.com/docs/DOC-228896 |title=Virtual Comedians Pick a Red Nose in Second Life |publisher=iReport.com |date=2009-03-13 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011/12, an all-[[Furry fandom|furry]] performing arts troupe, Ravenswood Theatricals, was launched at their own venue with successful, non-commercial virtual renditions of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[The Wizard of Oz (2011 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', the latter of which was received with glowing reviews.&lt;ref&gt;Forepawz Golem, "[http://www.slarf.org/phantom-of-the-opera/ The Phantom of the Opera — Show Review]," ''Second Life Avatar Review Files'', March 31, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://renoobed.wordpress.com/2011/11/19/the-ravenswood-theatre-company-presents-phantom-of-the-opera/ The Ravenswood Theatre Company Presents Phantom of the Opera]," ''Renoobed'', Nov. 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of further productions of established real-life pieces such as ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]'', ''[[Tanz der Vampire]]'', ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]'', and ''[[Into the Woods]]'' are reportedly planned, as well as a gala presentation of various musical numbers from upcoming productions.

==Virtual dance==

[[Virtual dance]] has been elevated in Second Life.

Ballet Pixelle® (formerly Second Life Ballet) was the first performing [[ballet company]] in Second Life (2006).  Ballet Pixelle®, with founder and artistic director Inarra Saarinen, produces all original animations, choreography, and music composed specifically for each ballet.  All dance is done as art, not automation, with the dancers actually dancing with each other and the music—there is no artificial synchronization involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://wwwballetpixelle.org/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130727204428/http://wwwballetpixelle.org/# |archive-date=2013-07-27 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

La Performance.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.la-performance.org/&lt;/ref&gt; started in May 2008 with live dance shows. Two shows are produced in a year, in March/April/May 2010 modern ballet show 'BACK TO BLACK'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.la-performance.org/show/174/back-to-black&lt;/ref&gt; with music by [[Queen (band)]], [[Francisco de la Torre (composer)|Francisco de la Torre]], [[Metallica]], [[Amy Winehouse]], [[Paula Cole]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Suzi Quatro]].

November/December 2011/January 2012: 'BORN'. March/April/May 2012: 'INSENSATEZ'.

==Books ==
There have been several books written about experiences in ''Second Life''. ''Second Life Love''&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/second-life-love/id466840476?mt=11 | title=Second Life Love (iTunes)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url= https://www.amazon.com/Second-Life-Love-Olsen/dp/1447816242/ref=sr_1_3?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322436821&amp;sr=1-3 | title=Second Life Love (Amazon)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is example of such a book. It is a dialog between Per Olsen en Li Gang Qin about their partnership in Second Life. The authors have never seen each other in real life.
&lt;br /&gt;
Other books include ''Second Life For Dummies''&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=https://www.amazon.ca/Second-Life-Dummies-Sarah-Robbins/dp/0470180250 | title=Second Life For Dummies (Amazon)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Sarah Robbins and Mark Bell, which was published in 2008 and provides assistance for new users of the virtual world, including basics, how to meet people, ideas for activities and places to visit, including how to access real life education in ''Second Life''.

==Second Life artists==

=== Annabeth Robinson ===
{{Main article|Annabeth Robinson}}

Annabeth Robinson, or AngryBeth Shortbread, creates online performances or installations using Second Life. For example, Robinson contributed to the 'Kritical Works in SL' project in 2008 to create a sound installation called ''Ping Space''.&lt;ref name="Doyle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Doyle |first=Denise |title=Virtual Worlds and New Realms of Creativity: The Kritical Works in SL Project |journal=International Journal of Performance Arts and Digital Media |volume=4 |issue=2-3 |pages=137–153(17) |date=1 May 2008 |url=http://www.tulane.edu/~simon/misc/Mardi%20Gras%20Conference%20Proceedings%202009/Session%202/Doyle.pdf |accessdate=2011-10-25 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a piece of work that involved two cubes reverberating sound from each other which would only happen when one cube was 300&amp;nbsp;ft above the other.&lt;ref name="Doyle"/&gt; Other such work can be found at the [[Annabeth Robinson]] page.

=== Garrett Lynch ===

{{Main article|Garrett Lynch}}

Garrett Lynch is an Irish new media artist working with networked technologies in a variety of forms including online art, installation, performance and writing. Since 2008 he has created a series of installation and performance works dealing with ideas of identity and place as they relate to networked spaces.  In these works Lynch explores the "real" and the "virtual" through the transposing of his own identity to virtual worlds such as [[Second life|Second Life]] without any attempt to masquerade or imagine a new identity.  This process involves the use of his real name for his "representation" or avatar, word play that references his names origins as both real and Irish and the use of a [[sandwich board]] prop stating this that is worn continuously.

In 2010/2011 he was artist in residence at [[HUMlab]], Yoshikaze Up-in-the-Air Residency.&lt;ref name=Yoshikaze&gt;{{cite web | url=http://yoshikaze.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/Garrett%20Lynch | title=Yoshikaze Up-in-the-Air Residency | author= |work= | publisher=Yoshikaze Up-in-the-Air Residency | accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HUMlab new artist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.humlab.umu.se/?p=2739 | title=HUMlab weblog announcing new artist | author=Jim Barrett |date=29 November 2010 |work= | publisher=HUMlab | accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outcomes of the residence have since been published as an artists book and an article in Metaverse Creativity (Volume 2, Number 2).&lt;ref name=metaverse-creativity&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lynch |first=Garrett |title=A Metaverse Art Residency: ‘Garrett Lynch Yoshikaze "Up-in-the-air" Second Life Residency’ |journal=Metaverse Creativity |volume=2 |issue=2 |year=2012 |pages=163–181 |publisher=Intellect Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently Lynch has and is currently performing with a custom-built scale reproduction of his Second Life "representations" sandwich board.

=== Gleman Jun ===

Gleman Jun is an Italian artist in Second Life. In the dynamic effects of colors, lights and transparencies, he expresses his creativity in a constantly evolving and transforming himself. In his case, a work of art is composed of two different elements:
vision and technique. "Vision" is the image that passes through his mind suddenly. "Technique" is the experience that allows the memory to translate the vision into a "real" and shareable object.

=== Second Front ===

Second Front is the first performance art group of [[Second life|Second Life]]. Founded in 2006, its current seven-member troupe includes Gazira Babeli (Italy), Yael Gilks (London), [[Bibbe Hansen]] (New York), Doug Jarvis (Victoria), [[Scott Kildall]] (San Francisco), Patrick Lichty (Chicago) and Liz Solo (St. Johns).

Second Front members collaborate remotely and their performances have been shown live in New York, Los Angeles, Moscow, Brussels, Berlin, Vancouver and many other cities. The group has been written about in publications including [[ArtForum]], [[Art in America]], Realtime Arts (Australia), Exibart (Italy) and Digital Art, (Second Edition) by [[Christiane Paul (curator)]].

==Second Life Art group==
SL Art is one of the most popular art groups in Second Life. Its goal is to recognize the art in virtual worlds at the same level of [[Outline of the visual arts|visual art]] in real life. There are several second Life publications that work to promote Second Life Art, including Windlight Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;http://wwwwindlightmagazine.com{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the SL Newser,&lt;ref&gt;http://slnewser.blogspot.ca/p/meet-crew.html&lt;/ref&gt;  and the SL Enquirer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slenquirer.com/2015/10/spotlight-on-halloween-mage-dean-lawson.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Circle Limit III''''' is a [[woodcut]] made in 1959 by Dutch artist [[M. C. Escher]], in which "strings of fish shoot up like rockets from infinitely far away" and then "fall back again whence they came".&lt;ref name="eq"&gt;Escher, as quoted by {{harvtxt|Coxeter|1979}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of a series of four woodcuts by Escher depicting ideas from [[hyperbolic geometry]].

and from the time of his 1937 artwork ''[[Metamorphosis I]]'' he had begun incorporating tessellated human and animal figures into his artworks.&lt;ref name="mside"/&gt;

In a 1958 letter from Escher to [[Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|H. S. M. Coxeter]], Escher wrote that he was inspired to make his ''Circle Limit'' series by a figure in Coxeter's article "Crystal 
Symmetry and its Generalizations".&lt;ref name="cox79"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emmer"/&gt; Coxeter's figure depicts a [[tessellation]] of the [[hyperbolic plane]] by [[right triangle]]s with angles of 30°, 45°, and 90°; triangles with these angles are possible in hyperbolic geometry but not in Euclidean geometry. This tessellation may be interpreted as depicting the lines of reflection and fundamental domains of the [[Truncated tetrahexagonal tiling|(6,4,2)]] [[triangle group]].&lt;ref&gt;Coxeter expanded on the mathematics of triangle group tessellations, including this one in {{citation

==Geometry==
[[File:Circle limits III with overlay.png|thumb|The [[alternated octagonal tiling]], a [[uniform tilings in hyperbolic plane|hyperbolic tiling]] of squares and equilateral triangles, overlaid on Escher's image]]
Escher seems to have believed that the white curves of his woodcut, which bisect the fish, represent hyperbolic lines in the [[Poincaré disk model]] of the hyperbolic plane, in which the whole hyperbolic plane is modeled as a disk in the Euclidean plane, and hyperbolic lines are modeled as circular arcs perpendicular to the disk boundary. Indeed, Escher wrote that the fish move "perpendicularly to the boundary".&lt;ref name="eq"/&gt; However, as Coxeter demonstrated, there is no hyperbolic [[arrangement of lines]] whose faces are alternately squares and equilateral triangles, as the figure depicts. Rather, the white curves are [[Hypercycle (geometry)|hypercycles]] that meet the boundary circle at angles of {{nowrap|cos&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; {{sfrac|2&lt;sup&gt;{{1/4}}&lt;/sup&gt; − 2&lt;sup&gt;−{{1/4}}&lt;/sup&gt;|2}},}} approximately&amp;nbsp;80°.&lt;ref name="cox79"/&gt;

The symmetry axes of the triangles and squares that lie between the white lines are true hyperbolic lines. The squares and triangles of the woodcut closely resemble the [[tritetragonal tiling]] of the hyperbolic plane, which also features squares and triangles meeting in the same incidence pattern.
However, the precise geometry of these shapes is not the same. In the tritetragonal tiling, the sides of the squares and triangles are hyperbolically straight line segments, which do not link up in smooth curves; instead they form [[polygonal chain]]s with corners. In Escher's woodcut, the sides of the squares and triangles are formed by arcs of hypercycles, which are not straight in hyperbolic geometry, but which connect smoothly to each other without corners.

The points at the centers of the squares, where four fish meet at their fins, form the vertices of an [[order-8 triangular tiling]], while the points where three fish fins meet and the points where three white lines cross together form the vertices of its [[Dual polyhedron|dual]], the [[octagonal tiling]].&lt;ref name="cox79"/&gt; Similar tessellations by lines of fish may be constructed for other hyperbolic tilings formed by [[polygon]]s other than triangles and squares, or with more than three white curves at each crossing.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Douglas|last=Dunham|contribution=More “Circle Limit III” patterns|url=https://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/dunbrid06.pdf|title=The Bridges Conference: Mathematical Connections in Art, Music, and Science, London, 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euclidean coordinates of circles containing the three most prominent white curves in the woodcut may be obtained by calculations in the field of rational numbers extended by the square roots of two and three.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=H. S. M.|last=Coxeter|authorlink=Harold Scott MacDonald Coxeter|contribution=The trigonometry of Escher’s woodcut ''Circle Limit III''|title=M.C.Escher’s Legacy: A Centennial Celebration|year=2003|publisher=Springer|pages=297–304|doi=10.1007/3-540-28849-X_29}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symmetry==
Viewed as a pattern, ignoring the colors of the fish, in the hyperbolic plane, the woodcut has three-fold and four-fold [[rotational symmetry]] at the centers of its triangles and squares, respectively, and order-three [[dihedral symmetry]] (the symmetry of an equilateral triangle) at the points where the white curves cross. In [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]'s [[orbifold notation]], this set of symmetries is denoted 433. Each fish provides a fundamental region for this symmetry group. Contrary to appearances, the fish do not have [[bilateral symmetry]]: the white curves of the drawing are not axes of reflection symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Conway wrote that "The work ''Circle Limit III'' is equally intriguing" (in comparison to ''Circle Limit IV'', which has a different symmetry group), and uses is it as an example of this symmetry group.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Herford|title=The geometry of M. C. Escher's circle-Limit-Woodcuts|journal=Zentralblatt für Didaktik der Mathematik|year=1999|volume=31|issue=5|pages=144–148|doi=10.1007/BF02659805}}. Paper presented to the 8th International Conference on Geometry, Nahsholim (Israel), March 7–14, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, the angle at the back of the right fin is 90° (where four fins meet), but at the back of the much smaller left fin it is 120° (where three fins meet).

==Printing details==
The fish in ''Circle Limit III'' are depicted in four colors, allowing each string of fish to have a single color and each two adjacent fish to have different colors. Together with the black ink used to outline the fish, the overall woodcut has five colors. It is printed from five wood blocks, each of which provides one of the colors within a quarter of the disk, for a total of 20 impressions. The diameter of the outer circle, as printed, is {{cvt|41.5|cm|frac=8}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=M. C.

Dashed lines indicate sourcing that isn't visible to the final reviewer.  In both cases, one original source (top) appears to the final reviewer (bottom) as two independent sources]]

'''Circular reporting''' or '''false confirmation''' is a situation in [[source criticism]] where a piece of information appears to come from multiple independent sources, but in reality comes from only one source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/caj/documents/vol_11/iss_2/CAJ_Vol11.2_12_e.pdf|title=The Challenge of Centralized Control Faced by the Intelligence Function in Afghanistan|publisher=Canadian Army Journal|date=Summer 2008|author1=Marcus Sterzer, CD|author2=Patrick McDuff B.A.|author3=Jacek Flasz|lastauthoramp=yes|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305201954/http://www.army.forces.gc.ca/caj/documents/vol_11/iss_2/CAJ_Vol11.2_12_e.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MotherJones"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/mojoblog/archives/2008/06/8595_three_days_in_r.html|title=The Cocktail Napkin Plan for Regime Change in Iran|date=June 2008|publisher=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, the problem happens mistakenly through sloppy intelligence gathering practices. However, at other times the situation can be intentionally contrived by the original source as a way of reinforcing the widespread belief in its information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=I Solemnly Swear|author1=Micheal T. Hurley |author2=Kenton V. Smith |ISBN=0-595-29947-4|chapter=8|page=128|quote=Circular reporting occurs when what is reported is fed back to the originator in revised fashion which makes it difficult to objectively view the end product until you can trace back the sources to determine where the original information actually came from. Pan Am would eventually try to play that game by trying to introduce into court news reports that they themselves had a hand in producing.}} [https://books.google.com/books?q=%22Circular+reporting+occurs+when+what+is+reported+is+fed+back+to+the+originator+in+revised+fashion+which+makes+it+difficult+to+objectively+view+the+end+product+until+you+can+trace+back+the+sources+to+determine+where+the+original+information+actually+came+from.+Pan+Am+would+eventually+try+to+play+that+game+by+trying+to+introduce+into+court+news+reports+that+they+themselves+had+a+hand+in+producing.%22&amp;btnG=Search+Books Google Book search], retrieved on 23 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

This problem occurs in a variety of fields, including [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence gathering]],&lt;ref name="MotherJones" /&gt; [[media echo chamber|journalism]], and scholarly [[research]]. It is of particular concern in [[military intelligence]] because the original source has a higher likelihood of wanting to pass on misinformation, and because the chain of reporting is [[fog of war|more prone to being obscured]]. The case of the 2002 [[Niger uranium forgeries]] was a classic instance of circular reporting by intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/feb/17/nation/na-niger17|title=2006-02-17|publisher=Los Angeles Times|quote="This became a classic case of circular reporting," said a U.S. intelligence official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to reporters.

People didn't realize it was the same bad information coming in different doors." | first1=Bob | last1=Drogin | first2=Tom | last2=Hamburger | date=2006-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples involving Wikipedia==
[[File:Relationship between Wikipedia and the press.svg|thumb|Diagram illustrating circular reporting by Wikipedia and the press]]
[[Wikipedia]] is sometimes criticized for being used as a source of circular reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/05/wikipedia-hoax-reveals-limits-of-journalists-research.ars |title=Wikipedia hoax points to the limits of journalists' research |publisher=Ars Technica |last=Timmer |first=John |date=May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikipedia advises researchers and journalists to [[WP:Citing Wikipedia|be wary of, and generally avoid, using Wikipedia as a direct source]], and instead focus on verifiable information found in an article's [[WP:Citing sources|cited references]].

In the following examples, false claims were propagated on Wikipedia and in news sources because of circular reporting. [[Randall Munroe|Randall Monroe]], in his comic [[xkcd]], coined the term "citogenesis" to describe this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://xkcd.com/978/|title=xkcd: Citogenesis|website=xkcd.com|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Wikipedia and [[The Northern Echo]]: In January 2014 a statement was anonymously added to the Wikipedia page on UK comedian/broadcaster [[Dave Gorman]] stating that "he had taken a career break for a sponsored hitch-hike around the Pacific Rim countries". When this was questioned, an article published at a later date (September 2014) in ''The Northern Echo'', a daily regional newspaper in North East England was cited as evidence. The falsity of the original claim was confirmed by Gorman in an episode of his UK TV show [[Modern Life is Goodish]] (first broadcast 22 November 2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hardwick|first1=Viv|title=Mears sets his sights on UK|url=http://wayback.archive.org/web/20140929214806/http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/entertainment/11460855.Mears_sets_his_sights_on_UK/|accessdate=30 August 2017|work=[[The Northern Echo]]|date=9 September 2014|quote=He once hitchhiked around the Pacific Rim countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7546">'''Dacian art''' is the art associated with the peoples known as [[Dacians]] or North Thracians; The Dacians created an art style in which the influences of Scythians and the Greeks can be seen. They were highly skilled in gold and silver working and in pottery making. Pottery was white with red decorations in floral, geometric, and stylized animal motifs. Similar decorations were worked in metal, especially the figure of a horse, which was common on Dacian coins.{{sfn| Waldman| Mason |2006|p=208}}  

==Background ==
[[File:Daci Terra Getarum cf Strabo.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dacians regions cf. [[Strabo]] (ca. 20 AD) by Muller (1877) {{sfn|Müller|1877|loc=tabulae XV}}]]
[[File:Muzeuldeistorienaturalavienaaurdacic2.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Dacian gold bowl found in Transylvania (Vienna Museum)]]

The Geto-Dacians lived in a very large territory, stretching from the [[Balkans]] to the northern [[Carpathians]] and from the [[Black Sea]] and the river [[Tyras]] to the [[Tisza|Tisa]] plain, sometimes even to the [[Middle Danube]].{{sfn|MacKenzie|1986|p=25}} Between 15th-12th century, the Dacian-Getae culture was influenced by the Bronze Age Tumulus-Urnfield warriors.{{sfn|Mountain|1998|p=59}}



Dacian civilization went through several stages of development, from the Thracian stage in the Bronze Age to the classical period of the Geto-Dacians (the first century BC to the first century AD).{{sfn|Giurescu|Nestorescu|1981|p=47}} In the [[Bronze Age]], proto-Thracian populations emerged from the fusion of the local [[Eneolithic|Eneolithic (Chalcolithic)]] stock with the intruders of the transitional [[Indo-Europeanization Period]]. From these proto-Thracians, in the [[Iron Age]], there were developed the Dacians of the [[Danubian-Carpathian Area]] on the one hand and the Thracians of the eastern [[Balkan Peninsula]] on the other.{{sfn|Dumitrescu|Boardman|1982|p=53}}

==Pre-Dacian periods==
North Thracian population was chiefly an Early Bronze Age mix of the descendants of intrusive stockbreeding people and of survivors of the autochthonous Chalcolithic culture that the newcomers had destroyed. In this ethnic synthesis which gave birth to the Thracian people, the former predominated but, especially in the more mountainous areas, vestiges of Chalcolithic traditions survived through the Early and into the Middle Bronze Age.{{sfn|Hoddinott|1989|p=52}}

The local, Daco-Thracian art should not be mistaken for the art of the Thracians south of the Balkans although mutual influences had undoubtedly appeared.{{sfn|Popescu|1971|p=62}}


Thracian art was typically geometric in its decoration, a taste which was a remnant of Late Bronze Age traditions.{{sfn|Farkas|1981|p=37}} While the Thracian tribes adopted-no doubt from the Scythians-some aspects of mounted nomadism in the first millennium B.C., they also preserved many traditions of the European Bronze Age and belonged more to the world of European cultures than to that of the East.{{sfn|Farkas|1981|p=33}}

==Classical Dacian periods==

The 1st century BC silver work from the lower Danube region consists mostly of bracelets and fibulae alongside of a small number of decorative disks, plaques, and bowls. To distinguish it from earlier Thracian silver work, one might label this later silver work as Geto-Dacian or Geto-Thracian depending on whether is found above or below the lower Danube.{{sfn|Olmsted|2001|p=22}}


The design of Geto-Dacian helmets (i.e. Ciumesti, Iron Gate) is sufficiently unusual in ancient art to offer the opportunity to trace it to its origin, and, thereby, provide some insight into the Scythian elements that went into the formation of early Dacian art and the means by which ancient Oriental motifs survived and were transmitted into Europe{{sfn|Goldman|1970|p=904}} Almost identical in decoration and details of craftsmanship are the two silver beakers, now in Bucharest and New York and unquestionably were made in the same metalsmith shop as the helmet.{{sfn|Goldman|1970|p=904}}

The '''Danish Film Institute''' ({{lang-da|Det Danske Filminstitut}}) is the national [[Denmark|Danish]] agency responsible for supporting and encouraging film and cinema culture, and for conserving these in the national interest.

Also known as '''''Filmhuset''''' ("the film house"), it is located in [[Gothersgade]] in central [[Copenhagen]]. Facilities directed at the general public include a library and [[Cinemateket]] which is Denmark's national film museum.

It is an institution under the [[Ministry of Culture of Denmark|Danish Ministry of Cultural Affairs]]. The current Director of the Film Institute is Claus Ladegaard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.b.dk/kultur/claus-ladegaard-tager-styringen-hos-filminstituttet|title=Claus Ladegaard tager styringen hos Filminstituttet|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Berlingske|accessdate=2018-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The institute is a member of [[European Film Promotion]], the network of European film organisations for the worldwide promotion of European film.

==History==
The Danish Film Institute was founded in 1972, replacing the Danish Film Foundation (Danish: Den Danske Filmfond). In 1996 a new Danish Film Act merged the Film Institute with Statens Filmcentral and the National Danish Film Museum with effect from the following year and at the same event the institution relocated to its current premises at Filmhuset in Gothersgade.

==Activities==
The Danish Film Institute is active within three main areas which are subsidized:
* Production and development of all types of films
* Distribution and communication of films and film culture
* Archives and museum activities
The Film Institute presents Danish films at feastivals abroad and in Denmark and subsidizes the import of foreign quality films. It maintains the [[Danish National Filmography]] (''Danmarks Nationalfilmografi''), a database about Danish films since 1896.

==Facilities==

===Cinemateket===
Cinemateket is the national Danish film museum, dedicated to broaden the knowledge and interest in Danish as well as foreign film. It has three cinemas which show a combination of film classics and quality films of various themes. Occasionally contemporary films which would otherwise not reach the Danish market are shown. In the videoteque in the library is it possible to watch [[short film|short]] and [[documentary film]]s. Other facilities include a book shop, a café and a restaurant.

===Library===
The Danish Film Institute's library on the first floor holds 55,000 books and subscribes to 240 mainly European and American magazines. The library lends regular books—usually for a period of one month—while magazines, manuscripts and rarer publications may only be referenced on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aok.dk/byen-rundt/det-danske-filminstituts-bibliotek|title=Det Danske Filminstituts Bibliotek|publisher=AOK|accessdate=2010-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''dramatistic pentad''' forms the core structure of [[dramatism]], a method for examining motivations that the renowned [[literary critic]] [[Kenneth Burke]] developed.  Dramatism recommends the use of a [[metalinguistic]] approach to stories about human action that investigates the roles and uses of five [[rhetoric]]al elements common to all narratives, each of which is related to a question. These five rhetorical elements form the "dramatistic pentad." Burke argues that an evaluation of the relative emphasis that is given to each of the five elements by a human drama enables a determination of the motive for the behaviour of its [[Character (arts)|character]]s. A character's stress on one element over the others suggests their [[world view]].

Burke introduced the pentad in his 1945 book "A Grammar of Motives". Burke based his pentad on the scholastic hexameter which defines "questions to be answered in the treatment of a topic: Who, what, where, by what means, why, how, when".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Burke created the pentad by combining several of the categories in the scholastic hexameter. The result was a pentad that has the five categories of: act, scene, agent, agency, and purpose. Burke states, "The 'who' is obviously covered by agent. Scene covers the 'where' and the 'when'. The 'why' is purpose. 'How' and 'by what means' fall under agency. All that is left to take care of is act in our terms and 'what' in the scholastic formula".&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pentad also closely follows the journalistic '[[Five Ws]]': who, what, when, where, why. 'Who' maps to agent. 'What' maps to action. 'When' and 'Where' map to scene. 'Why' maps to purpose. There is no direct mapping from the Five Ws to the pentads category of agency but Geoff Hart states "Some authorities add a sixth question, “how”, to this list, but “how to” information generally fits under what, where, or when, depending on the nature of the information." &lt;ref&gt;"The Five Ws of Online Help". by Geoff Hart, TECHWR-L. Retrieved April 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetorical elements of the dramatistic pentad==
The dramatistic pentad comprises the five rhetorical elements: Act, Scene, Agent, Agency, and Purpose. The “world views” listed below reflect the prominent schools of thought during Burke’s time, “without dismissing any of them," to read them "at once sympathetically and critically in relation to each other," and "in a wider context than any of them recognizes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fergusson|first1=Francis|title=Kenneth Burke's A Grammar of Motives|date=1957|publisher=Doubleday Anchor Books|location=NY|pages=193–204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act===
Act, which is associated with dramatic action verbs and answers the question "what?", is related to the world view of [[Philosophical realism|realism]]; What happened? What is the action? What is going on? What action; what thoughts? Burke defines the act as that which “names what took place, in thought or deed.” Since an act is likely composed of many separate actions, Burke states that “any verb, no matter how specific or general, that has connotations of consciousness or purpose falls under this category.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene===
Scene, which is associated with the [[Setting (fiction)|setting]] of an act and answers the questions "when?" and "where?", is related to the world view of [[materialism]] and minimal or non-existent [[free will]]. Burke defines the scene as “the background of an act, the situation in which it occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Agent===
Agent, which answers the question "by whom?", reflects the world view of [[philosophical idealism]]. Burke defines the agent as “what person or kind of person performed the act.” &lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Agency===
Agency (means), which is associated with the person or the organization that committed the deed and answers the question "how?", implies a [[Pragmatism|pragmatic]] point of view. Burke defines agency as “what instrument or instruments he used.”&lt;ref name="A Grammar of Motives"/&gt;

===Purpose===
Purpose, which is associated with meaning and answers the question "why?", indicates that the agent seeks unity through identification with an ultimate meaning of life. Reflects the world view of mysticism. Purpose is inextricably linked to the analysis of “Motive” which, derived from the title of A Grammar of Motives, is the main subject of its analysis. Since Purpose is both the subject of analysis and an element of the dramatistic pentad, it is not a common element to be included in a ratio.

==Ratios within the dramatistic pentad==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke provides a system of analysis for the Scene-Act ratio and the Scene-Agent ratio, though his analysis of ratios in the analysis of rhetoric is not limited to these. He states that, “The principles of dramatic consistency would lead one to expect such cases of overlap among the terms; but while being aware of them we should firmly fix in our minds such cases as afford a clear differentiation. Our terms leaning themselves towards merger and division, we are here trying to divide two of them while recognizing their possibilities of merger.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus any two dramatistic elements can be analyzed in relation to each other, creating a ratio, and can produce individual, yet separate meanings which are equally valid. However, the rhetor’s selection of elements to compose a ratio should be scrutinized, as it can deflect attention away from or direct attention towards aspects of the rhetor’s desire.

This is what Burke calls the “Ubiquity of the Ratios,” claiming that the composition of ratios “are at the very centre of motivational assumptions,” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1307}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “The maxim ‘terrain determines tactics’ is a strict localization of the scene-act ratio, with ‘terrain’ as the casuistic equivalent for ‘scene’ in a military calculus of motives, and ‘tactics’ as the corresponding ‘act.’"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|page=1308}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of a situation as a multi-faceted occurrence is central to Burke’s concept of ratios. 
Likewise, the substitution of a dramatistic element with another can change an interpretation of the motive, allowing the analyst to modify the ratio in order to highlight the importance of a specific factor. For example, “the resistance of the Russian armies to the Nazi invasion could be explained ‘scenically’ in terms of the Soviet political and economic structure; or one could use the act-agent ratio, attributing the power and tenacity to ‘Russian’ traits of character. However, in deriving the act from the scene, one would have to credit socialism as a major scenic factor, whereas a derivation of the act from agents would allow for a much more felicitous explanation from the standpoint of capitalist apologists.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rhetor-agent also has a significant amount of power in crafting the perception of these ratios to their effect, “If an agent acts in keeping with his nature as an agent (act-agent ratio), he may change the nature of the scene accordingly (scene-act ratio) and thereby establish a state of unity between himself and his world (scene-agent ratio)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Act ratio===
The scene, or the setting, will contain the act, or the what/actions. The way in which the agent interacts with the scene draws out specific analyses usually related to the atmosphere of the setting. While Burke states that, “It is a principle of drama that the nature of acts and agents should be consistent with the nature of the scene,” some “comic and grotesque works may deliberately set these elements at odds with one another, audiences make allowances for such liberty, which reaffirms the same principle of consistency in its very violation.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reflects the division of most plays into very literal “acts,” as the agents who construct the scene are very literally “acters” whose work is played against the backdrop of the scene.The actions that a person performs are interpreted through the setting or happenings.&lt;ref name="Burke1978"&gt;Burke,Kenneth."Questions and Answers about the Pentad". National Council of Teachers of English, 1978, p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scene-Agent ratio===
A relationship between the agent (person) and the scene (place or setting). A scene can pose restrictions on the agent; in a narrative, the person and place should have some connection.&lt;ref name="Burke1978" /&gt;

===Act-Agent ratio===
While requiring the scene to contain them, the agent does not contain the act. Burke states that, “the agent is an author of his acts,” which can “make him or remake him in accordance with their nature.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Tradition|date=2001|page=1309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the main principles that separates act and agent, producing a linked cycle which constructs the presentation of the agent’s identity.

==A sixth element==
In A Grammar of Motives, Burke mentions that attitude is “a state of mind,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Burke|first1=Kenneth|title=A Grammar of Motives|journal=The Rhetorical Situation|date=2001|page=1302}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining exterior from the pentad, as it is often “a preparation for an act, which would make it kind of symbolic act, or incipient act. But in its character as a state of mind that may or may not lead to an act, it is clearly classified under the head of agent.”. Burke also refers to attitude as a variation of agency.&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; Prior to 1969 the term attitude is placed under agency, act or agent and is not considered a sixth element.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. "A Grammar of Motives". University of California Press, 1969, p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, Burke places attitude as a new sixth element, yet he does not refer to the pentad as a hexad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010"&gt;Anderson, F. D., &amp; Althouse, M. T. (2010). “Five Fingers or Six? Pentad or Hexad”. KB Journal, 6(2). Retrieved October 27, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Attitude is defined as "the preparation for an act, which would make it a kind of symbolic act, or incipient act." The attitude, like the agency, would answer the “how?”.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, Kenneth. (1965). “Permanence and Change”. 1954. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill.&lt;/ref&gt; There is still some uncertainty over whether attitude is an additional element, and thus makes the dramatistic pentad a hexad, or if it is still a sub-element of the original pentad.&lt;ref name="Anderson2010" /&gt; While Burke has never directly stated that the pentad is a hexad, he has admitted that the addition of attitude to the pentad is similar to gaining “another soul” or an “extra existence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Andrew|title=Disciplining The Master: Finding the Via Media for Kenneth Burke|journal=American Communication Journal|date=2001|volume=4|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars have read this as Burke’s desire not to “dispose of” ambiguity, but rather to “study and clarify the resources of ambiguity.”&lt;ref name=Anderson2010 /&gt; As a result, many diagrams of the pentad depict attitude as a derivative of agent.

''E.S.P.'' is a [[computer and video game|game]] giving players the opportunity to find out whether they possess [[extrasensory perception]]. While displaying a constantly changing graphic design on the screen, the program briefly flashes emotionally charged words, randomly chosen from a word list, on the screen.  The program then asks a series of questions to determine if the player's attitudes have been influenced by the subliminal messages.  A file-builder is included to allow players to insert new words in the data base.

The program was offered in both a stand-alone [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] version and a compendium, along with ''E.S.P.'' and ''Zintar'', called Party-Pak I.  However, Edu-Ware dropped the game from its product line by the time its August 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

''Perception'' is a [[puzzle game]] consisting of three [[Video game|games]] designed to challenge and improve players' [[visual perception|visual skills]]. The first involves using [[Paddle (game controller)|game paddles]] to draw lines matching those drawn by the computer.  The second, based on a [[World War II]] test for [[spy]] candidates, tests players' power of observation by showing them only small glimpses of an [[abstract object]] as a narrow mask travels over it and then asking them to choose from among several objects what they had just seen.  The third modules tests player's visual memory by requiring them to distinguish sizes of identical shapes.  Players have control over the shape, display time, and presentation format.

Originally developed by Steffin before founding Edu-Ware, he wrote a second version of the program soon after establishing the [[Video game publisher|publishing company]]. The program was offered as both a stand-alone versions, and in a compendium, along with ''Statistics'' and ''[[Compu-Read]]'', called Edu-Pak I. Edu-Ware upgraded the program to high respolution graphics using its EWS3 graphics engine in [[1982 in video gaming|1982]], renaming it ''Perception 3.0'', which was featured in the company's catalogs until [[1984 in video gaming|1984]].

Edu-Ware described it as being "more than just a [[Mad Libs|mad-libs]] game" because it described and made use of all parts of speech.&lt;ref name="August80Catalog"&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Product Catalog |date=August 1, 1980 |publisher=Edu-Ware Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Subliminal'' is a [[computer and video game|game]] testing whether players are influenced by [[subliminal messages]]. While the player is watching a constantly changing graphic design, the program quickly flashes an emotionally changed word on the screen.  The player then answers a series of questions to determine whether his attitudes has been affected by the subliminal message.  The program includes a file builder for modifying the data base from which the program randomly chooses the words to display.

The program was offered in both [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] and [[Cassette tape|cassette]] stand-alone versions, as well as in a compendium, along with ''Zintar'', called Party-Pak I.  However, Edu-Ware dropped the game from its product line by the time its August 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

''War'' is a numeric [[strategy game]] occurring in ten rounds.  In each round, the program would display a number on the screen and allow the player to type another number in response.  The program would then use both numbers in a formula to determine the winner for that round, and the side that won the most number of rounds would win the game.  The challenge for the player was to determine the formula the program was using to determine the winner in each round.

The program was offered in both [[Floppy disk#The 5.BC-inch minifloppy|disk]] and [[Cassette tape|cassette]] stand-alone versions, as well as in a compendium, along with ''Rescue'', called Rescue/War, but was dropped from Edu-Ware's product line by the time its March 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

''Zintar'' is a [[drinking game]] in which players are instructed by the computer (randomly) to "take hits" while watching a series of color and black &amp; white graphics.  A scoreboard kept track and designated the player who had been assigned the most hits as "The Mayor". It was Pederson's first Apple II program written strictly for fun; Sherwin Steffin supplied the graphics. Edu-Ware offered it for sale after being encouraged by an early mail order distributor. This controversial [[party game]] was advertised in Edu-Ware's catalogs as being banned by [[Apple II]] retailer [[Rainbow Computing]].  However, Edu-Ware dropped the game from its product line by the time its August 1, 1980 catalog was issued.

A photograph taken four minutes after her death by photography student Robert Wiles has become an iconic [[suicide]] photograph, referred to as "the most beautiful suicide".&lt;ref name="time_'The"&gt;{{Cite web |title='The Most Beautiful Suicide': A Violent Death, an Immortal Photo |author=Ben Cosgrove |work=TIME.com |date=March 19, 2014 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=http://time.com/3456028/the-most-beautiful-suicide-a-violent-death-an-immortal-photo/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyti_Cras"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Crashing to Earth, Again and Again |author=Page, Max |work=New York Times |date=April 23, 2006 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/23/nyregion/thecity/23scar.html?_r=1&amp;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Evelyn McHale was born in [[Berkeley, California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.californiabirthindex.org/birth/evelyn_f_mchale_born_1923_797875 |work=[[California Birth Index]] |title=The Birth of Evelyn Mchale |accessdate=May 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of nine children to Helen and Vincent McHale. Vincent was a [[bank examiner]] and relocated to [[Washington D.C.]] in 1930. Her mother suffered from undiagnosed and untreated depression, this led to a challenging marriage, and ultimately a divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Evelyn Mchale |url=http://www.codex99.com/photography/43.html |website=Codex99 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent gained custody of all children and moved to [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe, New York.]]

After graduating from high school Evelyn joined the [[Women's Army Corps]], and was stationed in [[Jefferson City, Missouri]].

She later moved to [[Baldwin, Nassau County, New York|Baldwin, New York]] and was employed as a bookkeeper at the Kitab Engraving Company on [[Pearl Street (Manhattan)|Pearl Street]]. She met her fiance Barry Rhodes, a college student discharged from the United States Army Air Force.&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Most Beautiful Suicide: Evelyn McHale Leapt to Her Death from the Empire State Building, 1947 |author=Robert C.

===Death===
On April 30, 1947, McHale took a train from New York to [[Easton, Pennsylvania]] to visit Rhodes. The next day, after leaving Rhodes' residence, she returned to New York City and went to the Empire State Building where she jumped from the 86th floor observatory. A security guard was reportedly standing approximately ten feet from her just before she jumped.

Rhodes did not notice any indication of suicide before McHale left. Detective Frank Murray found her [[suicide note]] in a black pocketbook next to her neatly folded cloth coat over the observation deck wall which read:&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="real_TheW"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The Wild and Dark History of the Empire State Building, One of New York City's Most Recognized Landmarks, and Known for its Record-Breaking Height |last=Reporter |first=Staff |work=Realty Today |date=November 27, 2015 |accessdate=April 17, 2016 |url=http://www.realtytoday.com/articles/56503/20151127/wild-dark-history-empire-state-building-one-new-york-city.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her body was identified by her sister, Helen Brenner.

In accordance with her wishes, she was cremated with no memorial, service or grave.&lt;ref name="rare_TheM"/&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:Evelyn McHale.jpg|thumb|The Robert Wiles photo]]

The photo of her body, taken by Robert Wiles, has been compared to the photograph by [[Malcolm Wilde Browne]] of the [[self-immolation]] of Vietnamese Buddhist monk [[Thích Quảng Đức]] who burned himself alive at a busy Saigon road intersection on June 11, 1963, which is widely regarded as among the most iconic suicide photographs. Ben Cosgrove of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' described the photo as "technically rich, visually compelling and ... downright beautiful". Cosgrove described her body as "resting, or napping, rather than ... dead" and appears as if she is "daydreaming of her beau".&lt;ref name="time_'The"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gawk_Spec"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Specter Detector: Courting the Empire State Building's Prettiest Ghost |last=Conaboy |first=Kelly |work=[[Gawker]] |date=September 25, 2015 |accessdate=April 18, 2016 |url=http://gawker.com/specter-detector-courting-the-empire-state-buildings-p-1732169081 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425222325/http://gawker.com/specter-detector-courting-the-empire-state-buildings-p-1732169081 |archivedate=April 25, 2016 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her picture was also used on the cover of [[Saccharine Trust]]'s album ''[[Surviving You, Always]]'', released in 1984 by [[SST Records]].

[[David Bowie]]'s 1993 video for the single "[[Jump They Say]]" includes a recreation of the image, with the singer splayed atop a smashed car.

The cover of the 1995 album ''[[Gilt (album)|Gilt]]'' by the Tucson band [[Machines of Loving Grace]] uses a color photo that recreates the original image.

The shot is also referenced at the start of Taylor Swift's 'Bad Blood' video.

'''Gustav Bauernfeind''' (4 September 1848, [[Sulz am Neckar]] - 24 December 1904, [[Jerusalem]]) was a German [[Painting|painter]], [[illustrator]] and architect of partly Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;Son père, pharmacien juif autrichien installé en Bade-Wurtemberg, s'était converti au catholicisme. Cf. Adrian Darmon, Autour de l'Art Juif, Ed. Carnot, 2003, p.125&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered to be one of the most notable [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] painters of Germany.

==Life and career==
After completing his architectural studies at the [[University of Stuttgart|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Stuttgart]], he worked in the architectural firm of Professor Wilhelm Bäumer and later in that of Adolph Gnauth, where he also learned painting. In his earlier paintings, Bauernfeind focused on local views of Germany, as well as motifs from Italy. During his journey to the [[Levant]] from 1880 to 1882, he became interested in the [[Orient]] and repeated his travels again and again. In 1896 he moved with his wife and son all the way to Palestine and subsequently settled in Jerusalem in 1898. He also lived and worked in Lebanon and Syria.

His work is characterized primarily by architectural views of Jerusalem and the [[Holy Land]]. The paintings of Bauernfeind are mostly meticulously crafted, intricately composed and almost photographically accurate cityscapes and images of known sanctuaries in oil. In addition, he produced [[landscape art|landscape scenes]] and [[watercolor painting|watercolours]]. During his lifetime he was the most popular Orientalist painter of Germany, but soon fell into oblivion after his death. However, since the early 1980s, Bauernfeind was gradually rediscovered, with his paintings appearing at auctions with high prices. Thus, his oil painting ''The Wailing Wall'' was sold at [[Christie's]] in London for the equivalent of €326,000 in 1992. The same painting would reach at [[Sotheby's]] in London the equivalent of €4.5 million in a later auction in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Sefanie Stadel: ''Aufstieg eines Orientmalers.'' In: ''[[Welt am Sonntag]],'' Nr. 27/2007, S. 74&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, another oil painting of Bauernfeind, ''The Port of Jaffa'', was sold at the Van Ham Kunstauktionen in [[Cologne]] for 1,510,000 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]], thus becoming the most expensive 19th-century painting ever sold in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.van-ham.com/rekordgalerie/gdr/detail/neuere-meister/gustav-bauernfeind.html|title=Van Ham, Galerie der Rekorde|publisher=|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At his birthplace in Sulz am Neckar, the life and work of the painter is commemorated by the Gustav Bauernfeind Museum with a large permanent exhibition.

[[File:Wood Bodhisattva 2.jpg|thumb|right|230px|A [[China|Chinese]] wooden [[Bodhisattva]], [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]], [[Shanghai Museum]].]]
Wood carving is one of the oldest arts of humankind. Wooden spears from the Middle Paleolithic, such as the [[Clacton Spear]], show that people have engaged in utilitarian woodwork for millennia. Indeed the beginnings of the craft go so far back that, at least where [[timber]] is present, the use of wood exists as a universal in human culture as both a means to create or enhance technology and as a medium for artistry. The [[North American Indian]] carves his wooden fish-hook or his pipe stem just as the [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] works patterns on his paddle. The native of [[Guyana]] decorates his [[cavassa grater]] with a well-conceived scheme of incised scrolls, while the native of [[Loango Bay]] distorts his spoon with a design of figures standing up in full relief carrying a hammock. Wood carving is also present in architecture. 

Figure-work seems to have been universal. To carve a figure/design in wood may be not only more difficult but also less satisfactory than [[sculpture|sculpting]] with marble, owing to the tendency of wood to crack, to be damaged by insects, or to suffer from changes in the atmosphere. The texture of the material, too, often proves challenging to the expression of features, especially in the classic type of youthful face. On the other hand, magnificent examples exist of the more rugged features of age: the beetling brows, the furrows and lines neutralizing the defects of the grain of the wood. In ancient work the surface may not have been of such consequence, for figures as a rule being painted for protection and especially color.

It is not always realized at the present day to what extent color has even from the most ancient times been used to enhance the effect of wood-carving and sculpture. The modern colour prejudice against gold and other tints is perhaps because painted work has been vulgarized. The arrangement of a proper and harmonious scheme of colour is not the work of the [[Painter and decorator|house painter]], but of the specially trained artist.

In the early 20th century, the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]], on which much of this entry is based, commented, "Of late years carving has gone out of fashion. The work is necessarily slow and requires substantial skill, making the works expensive. Other and cheaper methods of decoration have driven carving from its former place. Machine work has much to answer for, and the endeavor to popularize the craft by means of the village class has not always achieved its own end. The gradual disappearance of the individual artist, elbowed out as he has been, by the contractor, is fatal to the continuance of an art which can never flourish when done at so much a yard." This statement has proven untrue, as the continued survival of the art and craft of woodcarving can be demonstrated by the large number of [[:Category:Woodcarvers|woodcarvers]] who have carried on or advanced the tradition in different parts of the world.

== Ancient Egypt ==
[[File:Modellino di barca, con schiavi, legno decorato, Museo Egizio, Torino.jpg|thumb|left|Ancient Egyptian servant statuettes]]

The extreme dryness of the climate of Egypt accounts for the existence of a number of woodcarvings from this remote period. Some wood panels from the tomb of Hosul Egypt, at [[Saqqara|Sakkarah]] are of the [[Old Kingdom|III. dynasty]]. The carving consists of [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and figures in low relief, and the style is extremely delicate and fine. A stool shown on one of the panels has the legs shaped like the fore and hind limbs of an animal, a form common in Egypt for thousands of years.

In the [[Cairo]] museum may be seen the statue of a man from the period of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]], possibly 4000 B.C. The expression of the face and the realism of the carriage have never been surpassed by any Egyptian sculptor of this or any other period. The figure is carved out of a solid block of sycamore, and in accordance with the Egyptian custom the arms are joined on. The eyes are inlaid with pieces of opaque white quartz, with a line of bronze surrounding to imitate the lid; a small disk of transparent [[Quartz|rock crystal]] forms the iris, while a tiny bit of polished ebony fixed behind the crystal imparts to it a lifelike sparkle. The [[Old Kingdom|IV., V. and VI. dynasties]] cover the finest period of Egyptian sculpture. The statues found in the tombs show a freedom of treatment which was never reached in later times. They are all portraits, which the artist strove his utmost to render exactly like his model. For these are not, like mere modern statues, simply works of art, but had primarily a religious signification [[Gaston Camille Charles Maspero|(Maspero)]]. As the spirits of the deceased might inhabit, these [[Ka (Egyptian soul)|Ka]] statues, the features and proportions were closely copied.

There are to be found in the principal museums of Europe many Egyptian examples: mummy cases of human beings with the face alone carved, animal mummy cases, sometimes boxes, with the figure of a lizard, perhaps, carved in full Mummy relief standing on the lid. Sometimes the animal would be carved in the round and its hollowed body used as the case itself.

Of furniture, folding seats like the modern camp stool, and chairs with legs terminating in the heads of beasts or the feet of animals, Furniture still exist. Beds supported by lions paws [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|XI. and XII.]] dynasties, from [[Gebelein]], now in the [[Egyptian Museum|Cairo Museum]]), headrests, 6 or 8 in. high, shaped like a crutch on a foot, very like those used by the [[Papuan people|native of New Guinea]] today, are carved with scenes, etc., in outline. In [[British Museum|the British Museum]] may be seen a tiny little coffer, 4 in. by 21/2 in., with very delicate figures carved in low relief. This little box stands on cabriole legs 3/4 of an inch long with claw feet, quite [[Louis Quinze]] in character. There are incense ladles, the handle representing a bouquet of lotus flowers, the bowl formed like the leaf of an aquatic plant with serrated edges from [[Gurnah]] during the [[New Kingdom|XVIII. dynasty]]; mirror handles, representing a little pillar, or a lotus stalk, sometimes surmounted by a head of [[Hathor]], the Egyptian Venus or of [[Bes]], god of the toilet; pin-cushions, in the shape of a small round tortoise with holes in the back for toilet pins, which were also of wood with dog-head ends (XI. dynasty, Cairo Museum); and perfume boxes such as a fish, the two halves forming the bottom and top of the perfume or pomatum was removed by little wooden spoons, one shaped in the form of a cartouche emerging from a full-blown lotus, another shaped like the neck of a goose, a third consisting of a dog running with a fish in its closed mouth, the fish forming the bowl. The list might be prolonged, but enough has been said to show to what a pitch of refinement the art of wood-carving had reached thousands of years before the birth of [[Christ]].

Of the work of [[Assyria]], [[Greece]] and [[Rome]], little is actually known except from history or inference. It may be safely assumed that the Assyria craft kept pace with the varying taste and refinement of Greece and all the older civilizations. Important pieces of wooden [[Roman sculpture]] which once existed in Greece and other ancient countries are only known to us from the descriptions of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] and other classic writers. Many examples of the wooden images of the gods, were preserved down to late historic times. The [[Palladium (mythology)|Palladium]], or sacred figure of [[Athena|Pallas]], which was guarded by the [[Vestal Virgin]]s in Rome and was fabled to have been brought by [[Aeneas]] from the burning [[Troy]], was one of these wooden figures.

== Western World / Europe ==

Great works of art were created in wood during the entire [[Middle Ages]], eg in [[Cathedrals]], Abbeys and other Church connected sites. These works demonstrated both craftsmanship and artistry.

===First eleven centuries of CE===
[[File:RomaSSabinaPortaLigneaParticolare.JPG|thumb|Detail from the carved portal, of [[Santa Sabina|St Sabina]] on the [[Aventine Hill]], dating back from the 5th century]]

Wood-carving examples of the first eleven centuries of CE are rare due to the fact that wood do decay easily in 1,000 years. The carved panels of the main doors of [[Santa Sabina|St Sabina]] on the [[Aventine Hill]], Rome, are very interesting specimens of early Christian relief sculpture in wood, dating, as the dresses show, from the 5th century. The doors are made up of a large number of small square panels, each minutely carved with a scene from the Old or New Testament. A very fine fragment of Byzantine art (11th or 12th centuries) is preserved in a monastery at [[Mount Athos]] in Macedonia. It consists of two panels (one above the other) of relief sculpture, surmounted by a semicircular arch of conventional foliage springing from columns ornamented with animals in foliage of spiral form. The capitals and bases are square, each face being carved with a figure. It is a wonderfully fine piece of work, conceived in the best decorative spirit.

In Scandinavian countries we find some very early work of excellent design, both Christian and Non-Christian in nature, as "The Christening" in that part of the world took place quite late in the first millenium CE. In the Christiania Museum there are some fine chairs. In the Copenhagen Museum there are panels from Iceland in the same style. The celebrated wooden doorways of Aal (1200 CE), Sauland, Flaa, Solder and other Norwegian churches (Christiania Museum) has dragons and intricate scroll work, a style which we still see carried on in the door-posts of the 15th century in the [[Nordiska museum]], [[Stockholm]], and in the Icelandic work of quite modern times. In these early days the leaf was not much developed in design. The carver depended almost entirely on the stalk, a style of work which has its counterpart in [[Myanmar|Burmese]] work of the 17th century.

=== Gothic period (12th–15th centuries) ===
Towards the end of this epoch wood-carving reached its culminating point. The [[choir stall]]s, [[Rood screen|rood-screens]], roofs, [[retable]]s, of [[Britain in the Middle Ages|England]], [[France in the Middle Ages|France]] and the [[Germanic peoples|Teutonic]] countries of Europe, have in execution, balance and proportion, never at any time been approached. In small designs, in detail, in minuteness, in mechanical accuracy, the carver of this time has had his rivals, but for greatness of architectural conception, for a just appreciation of decorative treatment, the designer of the 15th century stands alone.

[[File:Gothic woodcarved beauty 2d.jpg|thumb|left|Gothic beauty in carved wood]]
It should always be borne in mind that color was the keynote of this scheme. The custom was practically universal, and enough traces remain to show how splendid was the effect of these old Gothic churches and cathedrals. The priests in their gorgeous [[vestment]]s, the lights, the [[crucifix]], the banners and [[incense]], the [[fresco]]ed or diapered walls, and that crowning glory of [[Gothic art]], the [[stained glass]], were all in harmony with these beautiful schemes of colored carved work. Red, blue, green, white and gilding were the tints as a rule used. Not only were the screens painted in colors, but the parts painted white were often further decorated with delicate lines and sprigs of foliage in conventional pattern. The plain surfaces of the panels were also adorned with saints, often on a background of delicate [[gesso]] diaper, colored or [[Gilding|gilded]] (Southwold). Nothing could exceed the beauty of the [[triptych]]s or retables of [[Holy Roman Empire|Germany]], [[Flanders (county)|Flanders]] or France; carved with scenes from the [[New Testament]] in [[Alto-relievo|high relief]] arranged under a delicate lacework of canopies and clustered pinnacles glistening with gold and brilliant colors. In Germany the effect was further enhanced by emphasizing parts of the gilding by means of a transparent varnish tinted with red or green, thus giving a special tone to the metallic [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]].

The style of design used during this great period owes much of its interest to the now obsolete custom of directly employing the [[Artisan|craftsman]] and his men, instead of the present-day habit of giving the work to a contractor. It is easy to trace how those bands of carvers traveled about from church to church. In one district the designer would employ a particular form and arrangement of vine leaf, while in another adjoining quite a different style repeatedly appears. The general scheme was of course planned by one mastermind, but the carrying out of each section, each part, each detail, was left to the individual workman. Hence that variety of treatment, that endless diversity, which gives a charm and interest to Gothic art, unknown in more symmetrical epochs. The Gothic craftsman appreciated the cardinal fact that in design beautiful detail does not necessarily ensure a beautiful [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], and subordinated the individual part to the general effect. He also often carved [[in situ]], a practice seldom if ever followed in the present day. Here and there one comes across the work of long years ago still unfinished. A half-completed bench-end, a fragment of screen left plain, clearly show that sometimes at least the church was the workshop.

=== Gothic and Renaissance: A comparison ===
Gothic design roughly divides itself into two classes:
#the geometrical, i.e. tracery and diaper patterns, and
#the foliage designs, where the mechanical scroll of the Renaissance is as a rule absent.

The lines of foliage treatment, so common in the bands of the 15th-century roodscreens and the panel work especially of Germany, serve to illustrate the widely different motives of the craftsmen of these two great epochs. Again, while the Renaissance designer as a rule made the two sides of the panel alike, the Gothic carver seldom repeated a single detail. While his main lines and grouping corresponded, his detail differed. Of numberless examples a 15th-century chest (Plate III. fig. 6) in the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin]] may be referred to. The arrangements of foliage, etc., on top, back and front, are typical of Gothic at its best.

=== End of the 12th century ===
As this section treats of woodcarving in Europe generally, and not of any one country alone, the dates just named must be of necessity only approximate. The 13th century was marked not only by great skill both in design and treatment, but also much devotional feeling. The craftsman seems to have not merely carved, but to have carved to the glory of God. At no time was work more delicately conceived or more beautifully cut. This early Gothic style certainly lent itself to fine finish, and in this respect was more suited to stone treatment than to wood. But the loving care bestowed on each detail seems to point to a religious devotion which is sometimes absent from later work. Very good examples of [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] (now, alas, divided down the center) are to be seen in [[Peterborough Cathedral|Peterborough cathedral]]. Scrolls and foliage spring from groups of columns of four. Some [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italian]] [[column]]s of the same date ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]]) should be compared, much to the advantage of the former. [[Exeter Cathedral]] boasts [[misericord]]s unsurpassed for skilful workmanship; mermaids, dragons, elephants, masks, knights and other subjects introduced into foliage, form the designs. [[Salisbury Cathedral|Salisbury cathedral]] is noted for its stall elbows, and the [[reredos]] in the south [[transept]] of [[Adisham]], [[Kent]], is another fine example testifying to the great skill of the 13th-century woodcarvers. A very interesting set of stalls, the early history of which is unknown, was placed in [[Barming]] church, Kent, about the year 1868. The book rest ends are carved with two scrolls and an animal standing between, and the ends of the stalls with figure sculpture:

=== 1300–1380 ===
During this period foliage forms, though still conventional, more closely followed nature. The canopy work of the choir of Winchester contains exquisite carvings of oak and other leaves. The choir stalls of Ely and Chichester and the tomb of Edward III. in [[Westminster Abbey]] are all fine examples of this period. Exeter boasts a throne that of [[Walter de Stapledon|Bishop Stapledon]] (1308–1326) standing {{convert|57|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, which remains unequaled for perfection of proportion and delicacy of detail. In France the stalls of St Benoit-sur-Loire, Lisieux, and Évreux are good 14th-century examples. But little Gothic work is now to be seen in the churches of this country. It is to the museums we have to look for traces of the old Gothic carvers. The two retables in Dijon Museum, the work of [[Jacques de Baerze]] (1301), a sculptor of Flanders, who carved for [[Philip II, Duke of Burgundy|Philippe le Hardi]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], are masterpieces of design and workmanship. The tracery is of the very finest, chiefly gilt on backgrounds of diapered gesso.

=== 1380–1520 ===
Towards the end of the 14th century carvers gave up natural foliage treatment to a great extent, and took to more conventional forms. The oak and the maple no longer inspired the designer, but the vine was constantly employed. A very large amount of 15th-century work remains to us, but the briefest reference only can be made to some of the more beautiful examples that help to make this period so great.

The [[rood screen]], that wonderful feature of the medieval church, was now universal. It consisted of a tall screen of usually about thirty ft. high, on the top of which rested a loft, i.e. a platform rood about {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}. in width guarded on either side by a gallery screen, and either on the top or in front of that, facing the nave, was placed the rood, i.e. a large [[crucifix]] with figures of St Mary and St John on either side. This rood screen sometimes spanned the church in one continuous length ([[Leeds, Kent]]), but often filled in the aisle and [[chancel]] arches in three separate divisions (Church Handborough, Oxon.). The loft was as a rule approached by a winding stair built in the thickness of the aisle wall. The lower part of the screen itself was solid paneled to a height of about {{convert|3|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} and the upper part of this paneling was filled in with tracery (Carbrook, Norfolk), while the remaining flat surfaces of the panels were often pictured with saints on a background of delicate [[gesso]] [[diaper]] ([[Southwold|Southwold, Suffolk]]). Towards the end of this period the employment of figures became less common as a means of decoration, and the panels were sometimes filled- entirely with carved foliage (Swimbridge, Devon). The upper part of the rood screen consisted of open arches with the heads filled in with pierced tracery, often enriched with [[crocket]]s (Seaming, Norfolk), embattled transoms ([[Hedingham Castle]], [[Essex]]), or floriated cusps ([[Eye, Suffolk]]). The mullions were constantly carved with foliage (Cheddar, Somerset), pinnacles (Causton, Norfolk), angels ([[Pilton, Devon]]), or decorated with canopy work in gesso (Southwold). But the feature of these beautiful screens was the loft with its gallery and vaulting. The loft floor rested on the top of the rood screen and was usually balanced and kept in position by means of a groined vaulting (Harberton, Devon) or a cove (Eddington, Somerset). The finest examples of vaulting are to be seen in Devon. The bosses at the intersections of the ribs and the carved tracery of the screen at Honiton stand unrivaled. Many screens still possess the beam which formed the edge of the loft floor and on which the gallery rested. It was here that the medieval roodscreen carver gave most play to his fancy, and carved the finest designs in foliage to be seen throughout the whole Gothic period. Although these massed moulds, crests and bands have the appearance of being carved out of one log, they were in practice invariably built up in parts, much of the foliage, etc., being pierced and placed in hollow moulds in order to increase the shadow. As a rule the arrangement consisted of a crest running along the top, with a smaller one depending from the lower edge, and three bands of foliage and vine between them (Feniton, Devon). The designs of vine leaves at Kenton, Bow and Dartmouth, all in Devon, illustrate three very beautiful treatments of this plant. At Swimbridge, Devon, there is a very elaborate combination; the usual plain beads which separate the bands are carved with twisted foliage also. At Abbots Kerswell and other places in the district round Totnes the carvers introduced birds in the foliage with the best effect. The variety of cresting used is very great. That at Winchcomb, Gloucester, consists of dragons combined with vine leaves and foliage. It illustrates how Gothic carvers sometimes repeated their patterns in as mechanical a way as the worst workmen of the present time. Little can be said of the galleries, so few remain to us. They were nearly all pulled down when the order to destroy the roods was issued in 1548. That they were decorated with carved saints under niches (Llananno, Wales), or painted figures (Strencham, Worcester), is certain from the examples that have survived the Reformation. At Atherington. Devon, the gallery front is decorated with the royal [[coat of arms]], other heraldic devices, and with prayers. The Breton screen at [[Le Faouët (Morbihan)|St Fiacre-le-Faouet]] is a wonderful example of French work of this time, btit does not compare with the best English examples. Its flamboyant lines and its small tracery never obtained any foothold in England, though screens carved in this way (Colebrook, Devon) are sometimes to be found.

The rood was sometimes of such dimensions as to require some support in addition to the gallery on which it rested. A carved beam was used from which a chain connected the rood itself. At [[Cullompton]], Devon, such a beam still exists, and is carved with foliage; an open cresting ornaments the under side and two angels support the ends. This particular rood stood on a base of rocks, skulls and bones, carved out of two solid logs averaging 18 in. wide and 21 in. high, and together measuring {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} long; there are round holes along the top which were probably used for lights.

No country in Europe possesses roofs to equal those of England created in the 15th century. The great roof of [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster Hall]] remains to the present day unique. In Norfolk and Suffolk roofs abound of the [[Hammerbeam roof|hammerbeam class]]; that at Woolpit, Suffolk, achieves the first rank of quality. Each bracket is carved with strongly designed foliage, the end of every beam terminates in an angel carrying a shield, and the purlins are crested, while each truss is supported by a canopied riche (containing a figure) resting on an angel corbel. Here, too, as at Ipswich and many other churches, there is a row of angels with outspread wings under the wall-plate. This idea of angels in the roof is a very beautiful one, and the effect is much enhanced by the coloring. The roof at St Nicholas, [[King's Lynn]], is a magnificent example of tiebeam construction. The trusses are filled in with tracery at the sides and the centres more or less open, and the beams, which are crested and embattled, contain a row of angels on either side. In Devon, Cullompton possesses a very fine semicircular ceiling supported at intervals by ribs pierced with carving. Each compartment is divided up into small square panels, crossed by diagonal ribs of cresting, while every joint is ornamented with a boss carved in the decorative way peculiar to the Gothic craftsman. The nave roof of [[Manchester Cathedral|Manchester cathedral]] is nearly flat, and is also divided up into small compartments and bossed; the beams are supported by carved brackets resting on corbels with angels at each base.

[[File:Ulm-Muenster-ChorGestuehl2-061104.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bust of [[Cicero]] by Jörg Syrlin t.E., in the [[Ulm Münster]]]]
In the 15th century, choir stalls with their canopies continued to increase in magnificence. Manchester cathedral (middle of 15th century) and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] chapel in Westminster Abbey (early 16th) are good examples of the fashion of massing ~7~7 pinnacles and canopies; a custom which hardly compares with the more simple beauty of the 14th-century work of [[Ely Cathedral|Ely cathedral]]. The stalls of [[Amiens Cathedral|Amiens]] cathedral were perhaps the finest in the world at the beginning of the 16th century. The cresting employed, though common on the Continent, is of a kind hardly known in England, consisting as it does of arches springing from arches, and decorated with crockets and finials. The tabernacle work over the end seats, with its pinnacles and [[flying buttress]]es, stretches up towards the roof in tapering lines of the utmost delicacy. The choir stalls (the work of [[Jörg Syrlin the Elder]]) in Ulm cathedral are among the finest produced by the German carver. The front panels are carved with foliage of splendid decorative boldness, strength and character; the stall ends were carved with foliage and sculpture along the top edge, as was sometimes the case in Bavaria and France as well as Germany.

In early times the choir alone possessed seats, the nave being left bare. Gradually benches were introduced, and during the 15th century became universal. The [[Poppyhead (carving)|poppyhead]] form of B ornament now reached perfection and was constantly used enc for seats other than those of the choir. The name refers en a. to the carved finial which is so often used to complete the top of the bench end and is peculiarly English in character. In Devon and Cornwall it is rarely met with ([[Ilsington]], [[Devon]]). In Somerset it is more common, while in the eastern counties thousands of examples remain. The quite simple [[Fleur-de-lis|fleur-de-lys]] form of poppyhead, suitable for the village, is seen in perfection at Trunch, Norfolk, and the very elaborate form when the poppyhead springs from a crocketed circle filled in with sculpture, at St Nicholas, King's Lynn. Often the foliage contained a face ([[St Margaret's, Cley]], Norfolk), or the poppyhead consisted of figures or birds only ([[Thurston, Suffolk]]) or a figure standing on a dragon (Great Brincton, Northampton); occasionally the traditional form was departed from and the finial carved like a lemon in outline (Bury St Edmuncis) or a diamond (Tirley, Glos.). In Denmark an ornament in the form of a large circle sometimes takes the place of the English poppy-head. In the Copenhagen Museum there is a set of bench ends of the 15th century with such a decoration carved with coats of arms, interlacing strap-work, etc. But the old 15th-century bench end did not depend entirely on the poppy-head for its embellishment. The side was constantly enriched with elaborate tracery (Dennington, Norfolk) or with tracery and domestic scenes (North Cadbury, Somerset), or would consist of a mass of sculpture in perspective, with canopy work, buttresses and sculptured niches, while the top of the bench end would be crowned with figures carved in the round, of the finest craftsmanship. Such work at Amiens cathedral is a marvel alike of conception, design and execution. In the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin]] some beautiful stall ends are to be seen. Out of a dragons mouth grows a conventional tree arranged and balanced in excellent proportion. On another, stall end a tree is carved growing out of the mouth of a fool. This custom of making foliage grow out of the mouth or eyes is hardly defensible, and was by no means confined to any country or time. We have plenty of Renaissance examples of the same treatment.

Before the 15th century preaching had not become a regular institution in England, and pulpits were not so common. However, the value of the sermon began to be appreciated from the use to which the Lollards and other sects put this method of teaching doctrine, and pulpits became a necessity. A very beautiful one exists at [[Kenton, Devon]]. It is, as is generally the case, octagonal, and stands on a foot. Each angle is carved with an upright column of foliage between pinnacles, and the panels, which are painted with saints, are enriched with carved canopies and foliage; it is, however, much restored. The puipit at Trull, Somerset, is noted for its fine figure carving. A large figure standing under a canonv fills each of the nanelled sides. while many other smaller figures help to enrich the general effect. Examples of Gothic sounding boards are very rare; that, together with the pulpit, in the choir of Winchester is of the time of [[Thomas Silkstede|Prior Silkstede]] (1520), and is carved with his rebus, a skein of twisted silk.

The usual form of font cover during the hundred years before the Reformation was pyramidal, the ribs of the salient angles being Fo straight and cusped (Frindsbury, Kent) or of curved outline and cusped (St Mildred, Canterbury). There is a very charming one of this form at Colebrook, Devon. It is quite plain but for a little angel kneeling on the top, with its hands clasped in prayer. But the most beautiful form is the massed collection of pinnacles and canopy work, of which there is such a fine example at [[Sudbury, Suffolk]]. It was not uncommon to carve a dove on the topmost pinnacle (Castleacre, Norfolk), in allusion to the descent of the Holy Spirit. The finest font in England is undoubtedly that of Ijiford, Suffolk. It rises some {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}}. in height, arid when the panels were painted with saints and the exquisite tabernacle work colored and gilded, must have been a masterpiece of Gothic craftsmanship. A cord connecting the tops of these covers with the roof or with a carved beam standing out from the wall, something like a crane (Salle, Norfolk), was used to remove the cover on the occasion of baptism.

Many [[lectern]]s of the Gothic period do not exist today. They usually had a double sloping desk which revolved round a central moulded post. The lectern at Swanscombe, Kent, has an eras, circle of good foliage ornamenting each face of the book rest, and sonic tracery work at either end. The box form is more common in France than in England, the pedestal of such a lectern being surrounded by a casing of three or more sides. A good example with six sides is in the church of Vance (France), and one of triangular form in the Muse of Bourges, while a four-sided box lectern is still in use in the church of Lenham, Kent. The Gothic prayer desk, used for private devotional purposes, is hardly known in England, but is not uncommon on the Continent. There is a beautiful specimen in the Muse, Bourges; the front and sides of the part for kneeling are carved with that small tracery of flowing character so common in France and Belgium during the latter part of the 15th century, and the back, which rises to a height of {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}., contains a little crucifix with traceried decoration above and below.

A word should be said about the [[ciboria]], so often found on the Oboria continent of Europe. In tapering arrangement of tabernacle work they rival the English font covers in delicacy of outline (Muse, Rouen).

Numbers of doors are to be met with not only in churches but also in private houses. [[Lavenham]], [[Suffolk]], is rich in work of this latter class. In England the general custom was to carve the head of the door only with tracery (East Brent, Somerset), but in the [[Tudor period]] doors were some times covered entirely with [[linenfold]] paneling ([[St Albans Abbey]]). This form of decoration was exceedingly common on the Continent as well as in England. In France the doors towards the latter part of the 15th century were often square-headed, or perhaps had the corners rounded. These doors were usually divided into some six or eight oblong panels of more or less equal size. One of the doors of Bourges Cathedral is treated thus, the panels being filled in with very good tracery enriched with crockets and coats of arms. But a more restrained form of treatment is constantly employed, as at the church of St Godard, Rouen, where the upper panels only are carved with tracery and coats of arms and the lower adorned with simple linenfold design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911 |title=Wood-Carving |page=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Spain and the Teutonic countries of Europe we look for the most important object of church decoration, the retable; the Reformation accounting for the absence in England of any work of this iec kind. The magnificent [[Altarpiece|altar-piece]] in [[Schleswig Cathedral|Schleswig cathedral]] was carved by [[Hans Bruggerman]], and consists, like many others, of a number of panels filled with figures standing some four or five deep. The figures in the foremost rows are carved entirely separate, and stand out by themselves, while the background is composed of figure work and architecture, etc., in diminishing perspective. The panels are grouped together under canopy work forming one harmonious whole. The genius of this great carver shows itself in the large variety of the facial expression of those wonderful figures all instinct with life and movement, In France few retables exist outside the museums. In the little church of Marissel, not far from [[Beauvais]], there is a retable consisting of eleven panels, the crucifixion being, of course, the principal subject. And there is a beautiful example from Antwerp in the Muse Cluny, Paris; the pierced tracery work which decorates the upper part being a good example of the style composed of interlacing segments of circles so common on the Continent during late Gothic times and but seldom practised in England. ln Spain the cathedral of Valladolid was famous for its retable, and [[Alonzo Cano|Alonso Cano]] and other sculptors frequently used wood for large statuary, which was painted in a very realistic way with the most startlingly lifelike effect. Denmark also possessed a school of able wood-carvers who imitated the great altar-pieces of Germany. A very large and well-carved example still exists in the cathedral of Roskilde. But besides these great altarpieces tiny little models were carved on a scale the minuteness of which staggers the beholder. [[Triptych]]s and shrines, etc., measuring but a few inches were filled in with tracery and figures that excite the utmost wonder. In the British Museum there is such a triptych (Flemish, I 511); the center panel, measuring an inch or two square, is crowded with figures in full relief and in diminishing perspective, after the custom of this period. This rests on a semicircular base which is carved with the [[Eucharist|Lord's Supper]], and is further ornamented with figures and animals. The whole thing inclusive measures about 9 in. high, and, with the triptych wings open, 5 in. wide. The extraordinary delicacy and minuteness of detail of this microscopic work baffle description. There is another such a piece, also Flemish, in the Wallace collection, which rivals that just referred to in rni&amp; applied talent. For, marvellous as these works of art are, they fail to satisfy. They make ones eyes ache, they worry one as to how the result could ever have been obtained, and after the first astonishment one must ever feel that the same work of art on a scale large enough for a cathedral could have been carved with half the labor.

With regard to paneling generally, there were, during the last fifty years of the period now under review, three styles of design followed by most European carvers, each of which attained great notoriety. Firstly, a developed form of small Panelling. tracery which was very common in France and the Netherlands. A square-headed panel would be filled in with small detail of flamboyant character, the perpendicular line or mullion being always subordinate, as in the German chasse (Muse Cluny), and in some cases absent, as the screen work of Évreux cathedral shows us. Secondly, the [[linenfold]] design. The great majority of examples are of a very conventional form, but at [[Bere Regis]], Dorsetshire, the designs with tassels, and at St Sauvur, Caen, those with fringe work, readily justify the universal title applied to this very decorative treatment of large surfaces. At the beginning of the 16th century yet another pattern became the fashion. The main lines of the design consisted of flat hollow mouldings sometimes in the form of interlacing circles (Gatton, Surrey), at other times chiefly straight (Rochester cathedral), and the intervening spaces would be filled in with cusps or sprigs of foliage. It marks the last struggle of this great school of design to withstand the oncoming flood of the new art, the great Renaissance. From this time onward Gothic work, in spite of various attempts, has never again taken a place in domestic decoration. The lines of the tracery style, the pinnacle, and the crocket unequaled as they have always been in devotional expression are universally considered unsuited for decoration in the ordinary house.

But little reference can be made to the domestic side of the period which ended with the dawn of the 16th century, because so few remains exist. At [[Bayeux]], [[Bourges]], [[Reims]] and preeminently [[Rouen]], we see by the figures of saints, bishops or virgins, how much the religious feeling of the Middle Ages entered into the domestic life. In England the carved corner post (which generally carried a bracket at the top to support the overhanging storey) calls for comment. In [[Ipswich]], there are several such posts. On one house near the river, that celebrated subject, the fox preaching to geese, is carved in graphic allusion to the dissemination of false doctrine.

Of mantelpieces, there is a good example in the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Rouen|Rouen Museum]]. The overhanging corners are supported by dragons and the plain mouldings have little bunches of foliage carved at either end, a custom as common in France during the 15th century as it was in England a century earlier; the screen. beam at Eastbourne parish church, for example.

As a rule, cabinets of the 15th century were rectangular in plan. In Germany and Austria the lower part was often enclosed, as well as the upper; the top, middle and lower rails being carved with geometrical design or with bands of foliage (Museum, Vienna). But it was also the custom to make these cupboards with the corners cut off, thus giving five sides to the piece of furniture. A very pretty instance, which is greatly enhanced by the metal work of the lock plates and hinges, is in the Muse Cluny, and there are other good specimens with the lower part open in the Victoria and Albert Museum, [[London]].

The [[Chest (furniture)|chest]] was a very important piece of furniture, and is often to be met with covered with the most elaborate carving (Orleans Museum). There is a splendid chest (14th century) in the [[Musée de Cluny|Cluny Museum]]; the front is carved with twelve knights in armour standing under as many arches, and the spandrels are filled in with faces, dragons and so on. But it is to the 15th century that we look for the best work of this class; there is no finer example than that in the [[Kunstgewerbemuseum Berlin]]. The front is a very animated hunting scene most decoratively arranged in a scheme of foliage, and the top bears two coats of arms with helms, crests and mantling. But the more general custom in chest decoration was to employ tracery with or without figure work; Avignon Museum contains some typical examples of the latter class.

A certain number of seats used for domestic purposes are of great interest. A good example of the long bench placed against the wall, with lofty panelled back and canopy over, is in the [[Musée Cluny]], Paris. In the Museum at [[Rouen]] is a long seat of a movable kind with a low panelled back of pierced tracery, and in the Dijon Museum there is a good example of the typical chair of the period, with arms and high panelled and traceried back. There was a style of design admirably suited to the decoration of furniture when made of softwood such as pine. It somewhat resembled the excellent Scandinavian treatment of the 10th-12th centuries already referred to. A pattern of Gothic foliage, often of beautiful outline, would be simply grounded out to a shallow depth. The shadows, curves and twists only being emphasized by a few well-disposed cuts with a [[V tool]]; and of course the whole effect greatly improved by colour. A Swiss door of the 15th century in the Berlin Museum, and some German, Swiss and Tirolese work in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], offer patterns that might well be imitated today by those who require simple decoration while avoiding the hackneyed Elizabethan forms.

It is hard to compare the figure work of England with that on the Continent owing to the disastrous effect of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. But when we examine the roofs of the Eastern counties, the bench ends of Somerset, or the misereres{{Clarify|date=February 2013|reason=Should this be misericord?}} in many parts of the country, we can appreciate how largely wood sculpture was used for purposes of decoration. If as a rule the figure work was I not of a very high order, we have conspicuous exceptions in the stall elbows of Sherborne, and the pulpit of Trull, Somerset. Perhaps the oldest instance is the often mutilated and often restored effigy of Robert, [[Duke of Normandy]], in [[Gloucester Cathedral]] (12th century), and carved, as was generally the case in England, in oak. At [[Clifton Reynes]], Buckingham, there are two figures of the 13th century. They are both hollowed out from the back in order to facilitate seasoning the wood and to prevent cracking. During the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries there are numberless instances of figure carving of the most graphic description afforded in the misereres{{Clarify|date=February 2013|reason=Should this be misericord?}} in many of our churches and cathedrals. But of figures carved in the round apart from their surroundings hardly an instance remains. At the little chapel of Cartmel Fell, in the wilds of Westmorland, there is a figure of Our Lord from a crucifix, some {{convert|2|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} in length. The cross is gone, the arms are broken away, and the feet have been burned off. A second figure of Our Lord (originally in the church of Keynes Inferior) is in the museum of Caerleon, and a third, from a church in Lincolnshire, is now in a private collection. On the continent some of the finest figure work is to be found in the retables, some of which are in the Victoria and Albert Museum. A Tirolese panel of the 15th century carved in high relief, representing St John seated with his back to the onlooker, is a masterpiece of perspective and foreshortening, and the drapery folds are perfect. The same may be said of a small statue of the Virgin, carved in lime by a Swiss hand, and some work of the great [[Tilman Riemenschneider]] of [[Würzburg|Wurzburg]] (1460–1531) shows that stone sculptors of medieval times were not ashamed of wood.

===Renaissance period (16th–17th centuries)===
With the beginning of the 16th century, the great [[Renaissance]] began to elbow its way in to the exclusion of Gothic design. But the process was not sudden, and much transition work has great merit. The rood screen at Hurst, [[Berkshire]], the stall work of [[Cartmel Priory]], Westmorland, and the bench ends of many of the churches in [[Somerset]], give good illustrations. But the new style was unequal to the old in devotional feeling, except in classic buildings like [[St Paul's Cathedral]], where the stalls of Grinling Gibbons better suit their own surroundings. The rest of this article will therefore be devoted in the main to domestic work, and the exact location of examples can only be given when not the property of private owners or where the public have access.

During the 16th century the best work is undoubtedly to be found on the Continent. [[France]], [[Germany]] and the Netherlands producing numberless examples not only of house decoration but of furniture as well. The wealth of the newly discovered [[Americas|American continent]] was only one factor which assisted in the civilizing influence of this time, and hand in hand with the spread of commerce came the desire for refinement. The custom of building houses chiefly in wood wherever timber was plentiful continued. [[Pilaster]]s took the place of pinnacles, and vases or dolphins assisted the acanthus leaf to oust the older forms of design. House fronts of wood gave ample scope to the carver. That of Sir Paul Pinder (1600), formerly in [[Bishopsgate]], but now preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is a good example of decorative treatment without overloading. The brackets carved in the shape of monsters which support the projecting upper storey are typical of hundreds of dwellings, as for instance St Peters Hospital, [[Bristol]]. The panels, too, of Sir Paul Pinders house are good examples of that [[Jacobean architecture|Jacobean]] form of medallion surrounded by scroll work which is at once as decorative as it is simple.

In England that familiar style known as [[Elizabethan furniture|Elizabethan]] and Jacobean prevailed throughout the 16th and 17th centuries. At the present time hardly a home in the land has not its old oak chest carved with the familiar half circle or scroll border along the top rail, or the arch pattern on the panels. The [[court cupboard]]s, with their solid or open under parts and upper [[cornice]] supported by turned [[baluster]]s of extravagant thickness, are to be seen wherever one goes. And chairs, real as well as spurious, with solid backs carved in the usual flat relief, are bought up with an avidity inseparable from fashion. Four-post bedsteads are harder to come by. The back is usually broken up into small panels and carved, the best effect being seen in those examples where the paneling or the framework only is decorated. The dining-hall tables often had six legs of great substance, which were turned somewhat after the shape of a covered cup, and were carved with foliage bearing a distant resemblance to the acanthus. Rooms were generally panelled with oak, sometimes divided at intervals by flat pilasters and the upper frieze carved with scroll work or dolphins. But the feature which distinguished the period was the [[fire mantle]]. It always must be the principal object in a room, and the Elizabethan carver fully appreciated this fact. By carving the [[chimney breast]] as a rule to the ceiling and covering the surrounding walls with more or less plain paneling, the designer, by thus concentrating the attention on one point, often produced results of a high order. [[Caryatid]] figures, pilasters and [[frieze]]s were among the customary details employed to produce good effects. No finer example exists than that lately removed from the old palace at [[Bromley-by-Bow]] to the Victoria and Albert Museum. The mantelshelf is {{convert|6|ft|m|abbr=on}}. from the ground and consists of a deep quadrant mould decorated with flat scroll work of good design. The supporting pilasters on either side are shaped and moulded in the customary Jacobean manner and are crowned by busts with Ionic capitals on the heads. Above the shelf the large center panel is deeply carved with the royal coat of arms with supporters and mantling, and on either side a semicircular arched niche contains a figure in classic dress. The [[Elizabethan]] carver often produced splendid staircases, sometimes carving the newel posts with heraldic figures bearing coats of arms, etc. The newels of a staircase at Highgate support different types of Cromwellian soldiers, carved with great vivacity and life. But in spite of excellent work, as for example the beautiful gallery at Hatfield, the carving of this period did not, so far as England was concerned, compare with other epochs, or with contemporary work in other parts of Europe. Much of the work is badly drawn and badly executed. It is true that good decorative effects were constantly obtained at the very minimum of cost, but it is difficult to discover much merit in work which really looks best when badly cut.

In France this flat and simple treatment was to a certain extent used. Doors were most suitably adorned in this way, and the split baluster so characteristic of Jacobean work is often to be met with. There are some very good cabinets in the museum at Lyngby, Denmark, illustrating these two methods of treatment in combination. But the Swiss and Austrians elaborated this style, greatly improving the effect by the addition of color. However, the best Continental designs adopted the typical acanthus foliage of Italy, while still retaining a certain amount of Gothic feeling in the strength of the lines and the cut of the detail. Panelling often long and narrow was commonly used for all sorts of domestic purposes, a feature being a medallion in the center with a simple arrangement of vase, dolphins, dragons, or birds and foliage filling in the spaces above and below.

The cabinets of the Netherlands and [[Belgium]] are excellent{{according to whom|date=October 2012}} models of design. These pieces of furniture were usually arranged in two storeys with a fine moulded and carved cornice, mid division and plinth. The pilasters at the sides, and small raised panels carved only on the projecting part, would compose a very harmonious whole. A proportion of the French cabinets are decorated with caryatids not carved in the best taste, and, like other French woodwork of this period, are sometimes overloaded with sculpture. The doors of St Maclou, Rouen, fine as they are, would hardly to-day be held up as models for imitation. A noteworthy set of doors belong to the [[Oudenaarde Town Hall]]. The central door contains twelve and that on either side eight panels, each of which is carved with Renaissance foliage surrounding an unobtrusive figure. In the [[Law Courts of Brussels|Palais de Justice]] we see that great scheme of decoration which takes up the whole of the fireplace end of the hall. Five large figures carved in the round are surrounded by small ones and with foliage and coats of arms.

In Italy, the birthplace of the Renaissance, there is much fine work of the 16th century. A very important school of design was promoted by [[Raphael]], whose patterns were used or adapted by a large number of craftsmen. The shutters of Raphaels Stanze in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]], and the choir stalls in the church of St Pietro de Cassinesi at Perugia, are among the most beautiful examples of this style of carving. The work is in slight relief, and carved in walnut with those graceful patterns which Raphael developed out of the newly discovered remains of ancient Roman wall painting from the palace of Nero and other places. In the Victoria and Albert Museum are many examples of Italian work: the door from a convent near Parma, with its three prominent masks and heavy gadroon moulds; a picture frame with a charming acanthus border and, egg and tongue moulds on either side; and various marriage chests in walnut covered with very elaborate schemes of carving. It is sometimes difficult to distinguish Spanish, or for that matter South of France work, from Italian, so much alike is the character. The Spaniards yield to none in good workmanship. Some Spanish panels of typical Italian design are in the Victoria and Albert Museum as well as cabinets of the purest Renaissance order. There is a wonderful Portuguese coffer (17th century) in this section. The top is deeply carved in little compartments with scenes from the life of Our Lord.

===17th–18th centuries===
In England, the great school of [[Grinling Gibbons]] arose. Although he carved many beautiful mouldings of conventional form ([[Hampton Court Palace]], Chatsworth, etc.), his name is usually associated with a very heavy form of decoration which was copied direct from nature. Great swags of drapery and foliage with fruit and dead birds, etc., would be carved in lime a foot thick. For technical skill these examples are unsurpassed; each grape would be undercut, the finer stalks and birds legs stand out quite separate, and as a consequence soon succumb to the energy of the housemaid's broom. Good work of this class is to be found at Petworth; [[Trinity College, Oxford]]; [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]; St Pauls cathedral; St James, Piccadilly; and many other London churches.

During the reigns of Louis XIV. and XV. the principal merit of carved design, i.e. its appropriateness and suitability, gradually disappeared. Furniture was often carved in a way hardly legitimate. The legs, the rails of tables and chairs, the frames of cabinets, of looking-glasses, instead of being first made fcr construction and strength. and then decorated, were first designed to carry cherubs heads and [[rococo]] (i.e. rock and shell ornament), quite regardless of utility or convenience. A wealth of such mistaken design was also applied to state carriages, to say nothing of bedsteads and other furniture. However, the wall paneling of the mansions of the rich, and sometimes the paneling of furniture, was decorated with rococo design in its least illegitimate form. The main part of the wood surface would be left plain, while the center would be carved with a medallion surrounded by foliage, vases or trophies of torches and musical instruments, etc., or perhaps the upper part of the panel would be thus treated. France led the fashion, which was more or less followed all over Europe. In England gilt chairs in the style of Louis XV. were made in some quantities. But [[Thomas Chippendale]], Ince and Mayhew, Sheraton, Johnson, Heppelwhite and other cabinet-makers did not as a rule use much carving in their designs. Scrolls, shells, ribbon, ears of corn, etc., in very fine relief, were, however, used in the embellishment of chairs, etc., and the claw and ball foot was employed as a termination to the cabriole legs of cabinets and other furniture.

The mantelpieces of the 18th century were, as a rule, carved in pine and painted white. Usually the shelves were narrow and supported by pilasters often of flat elliptic plan, sometimes by [[caryatid]]s, and the frieze would consist of a raised center panel carved with a classic scene in relief, or with a mask alone, and on either side a swag of flowers, fruit and foliage.
[[File:Apostels Groeden.jpg|thumb|Baroque woodcarved apostles from [[Val Gardena]]]]

Interior doorways were often decorated with a [[Pediment|broken pediment]] more or less ornate, and a swag of foliage commonly depended from either side over a background of scroll work. The outside porches so often seen in Queen Anne houses were of a character peculiar to the 18th century. A small platform or curved roof was supported by two large and heavy brackets carved with acanthus scroll work. The staircases were as a rule exceedingly good. Carved and pierced brackets were fixed to the open strings (i.e. the sides of the steps), giving a very pretty effect to the graceful balustrade of turned and twisted columns.

Renaissance figure work calls for little comment. During the 16th century many good examples were produced those priestly statues in the museum of Sens for example. But the figure work used in the decoration of cabinets, etc., seldom rose above the ordinary level. In the 18th century cherubs heads were fashionable and statuettes were sometimes carved in boxwood as ornaments, but as a means of decorating houses wood sculpture ceased to be. The Swiss, however, have kept up their reputation for animal sculpture to the present day, and still turn out cleverly carved chamois and bears, etc.; as a rule the more sketchily cut the better the merit. Their more ambitious works, their groups of cows, etc., sometimes reach a high level of excellence.

Between the 17th and 18th century a florid woodcarving industry started in the [[Val Gardena|Gardena]] valley, which is now located in the [[Italy|Italian]] province of [[South Tyrol]].  A network of people from that valley traveled on foot to all European cities, as far as to Lisbon and Saint Petersburg, to sell the products of hundreds of carvers. Finally in the 19th century in Gardena, mainly wooden toys and dolls known also as Dutch dolls or penny dolls, were carved by the millions of pieces. The  [[Museum Gherdëina]] in [[Urtijëi]] displays a large collection of examples of woodcarcarvings from that region.

[[Gilded woodcarving in Portugal]] and Spain continued to be produced, and the style exported to their New World colonies, and the [[Philippines]], [[Macao]] and [[Goa]].

=== 19th century to present day ===
Of the work of the 19th century onward little can be said in praise. Outside and beyond the present-day fashion for collecting old oak there seems to be no demand for carved decoration. In church work a certain number of carvers find occupation, as also for repairs or the production of imitations. But the carving one is accustomed to see in hotels or on board the modern ocean palace is in the main the work of the machine, often with finishing work done by human workers.

Nonetheless, the 1800s saw the teaching of woodcarving became formalized in several European countries. For example, the Austrian woodcarver [[Josef Moriggl]] (1841–1908) had a long career as a teacher, culminating in his appointment in 1893 as Professor at the Staats-Gewerbeschule (Craft School) in [[Innsbruck]], where he served until his retirement in 1907.

In [[Val Gardena|Gröden]] the institution of an art school in 1820 improved considerably the skills of the carvers. A new industrial branch developed with hundreds of artists and artisans dedicated to sculpture and manufacturing of statues and altars in wood exported to the whole world. Unfortunately the machine-carving industry, initiated in the 1950s and the [[Second Vatican Council]], caused hundreds of carvers in Val Gardena to quit their craft. A worldwide trade of machine-carved figuerines and statues ensued.

== Coptic ==
In the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period screens and other fittings were produced for the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] churches of Egypt by native Christian workmen. In the British Museum there is a set of ten small cedar panels from the church door of [[Sitt Miriam]], Cairo (13th century). The six sculptured figure panels are carved in very low relief and the four foliage panels are quite Oriental in character, intricate and fine both in detail and furnish. In the Cairo Museum there is much work treated, after the familiar Arab style, while other designs are quite [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] in character. The figure work is not of a very high order.

== Islamic work ==

[[File:Ahşapkapı.JPG|thumb|[[Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum]], [[İstanbul]]]]
[[Muslim]] wood-carvers of Persia, Syria, Egypt and Spain  are renowned for their skill, designed and executed the richest paneling and other decorations for wall linings, ceilings, pulpits and all kinds of fittings and furniture.{{According to whom|date=April 2012}} The mosques and private houses of Cairo, Damascus and other Oriental Cities are full of the most elaborate and minutely delicate woodwork. A favorite style of ornament was to cover the surface with very intricate interlacing patterns, formed by finely moulded ribs; the various geometrical spaces between the ribs were then filled in with small pieces of wood carved with foliage in slight relief. The use of different woods such as ebony or box, inlaid so as to emphasize the design, combined with the ingenious richness of the patterns, give this class of woodwork an almost unrivaled splendour of effect. Carved ivory is also often used for the filling in of the spaces. The Arabs are past masters in the art of carving flat surfaces in this way. A gate in the mosque of the sultan Bargoug (Cairo, 14th century) well illustrates this appreciation of lines and surfaces. The pulpit or mimbar (15th century) from a Cairo mosque, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, is also a good example in the same style, the small spaces in this case being filled in with ivory carved in flat relief.

Screens made up of labyrinths of complicated joinery, consisting of multitudes of tiny balusters connecting hexagons, squares or other forms, with the flat surfaces constantly enriched with small carvings, are familiar to every one. In Cairo we also have examples in the mosque of Qous (12th century) of that finely arranged geometrical interlacing of curves with foliage terminations which distinguishes the Saracenic designer. Six panels in the Victoria and Albert Museum (13th century), and work on the tomb of the sultan Li Ghoury (16th century), show how deeply this form of decoration was ingrained in the Arab nature. Figure work and animals were sometimes introduced, in medieval fashion, as in the six panels just referred to, and at the hflpital du Moristan (13th century) and the mosque of El Nesfy Qeycoun (14th century). There is a magnificent panel on the door of Beyt-el-Emyr. This exquisite design is composed of vine leaves and, grapes of conventional treatment in low relief. The Arab designer was fond of breaking up his paneling in a way reminding one of a similar Jacobean custom. The main panel would be divided into a number of hexagonal, triangular or other shapes, and each small space filled in with conventional scroll work. Much of this simple flat design reminds one of that Byzantine method from which the Elizabethan carvers were inspired.

== Persia ==
The Persian carvers closely followed Arab design. A pair of doors of the 14th century from Samarkand (Victoria and Albert Museum) are typical. Boxes, spoons and other small articles were often fretted with interlacing lines of Saracenic character, the delicacy and minuteness of the work requiring the utmost patience and skill. Many of the patterns remind one, of the sandalwood work of Madras, with the difference that the Persians v~ere satisfied with a much lower relief. Sometimes a very beautiful result was obtained by the sparing tise of fretted lattice pattern among foliage. A fine panel of the 14th century in the Victoria and Albert Museum shows how active was Arab influence even as far as Bokhara.

== India and Burma ==
Throughout the great [[India|Indian peninsula]] woodcarving of the most luxurious kind has been continuously produced for many centuries. The ancient [[Hindu temple]]s were decorated with doors, ceilings and various fittings carved in teak and other woods with patterns of extreme richness and minute elaboration. The doors of the temple of Somnath, on the north-west coast, were famed for their magnificence and were highly valued as sacred relics. In 1024 they were taken to Ghazni by the Moslem conqueror, Sultan Mahmud, and are now lying at the fort at Agra. The gates which now exist are very fine specimens of ancient woodcarving, but are likely copies of the original, likely ancient, doors. Many doors, columns, galleries or even entire house-fronts are covered with the most intricate design bewildering to behold (Bhera, Shahpur). But this is not always the case, and the Oriental is at times more restrained in his methods. Architectural detail is to be seen with enrichment carved round the framing. Hindu treatment of the circle is often exceedingly good, and might perhaps less rarely inspire western design.  Foliage, fruit and flowers are constantly adapted to a scheme of fret-cut decoration for doors or windows as well as the frames of chairs and the edges of tables. Southern Indian wood carvers are known to work often with sandalwood, always covered with design, where scenes or characters from Hindu mythology occupy space. Many of the gong stands of Burma show the highest skill; the arrangement of two figures bearing a pole from which a gong hangs is familiar.

== Indochina and the Far East ==
[[File:Vietnamese wooden ceiling.jpg|thumb|upright|Details of a Vietnamese wooden ceiling]]
In these countries the carver is unrivaled for deftness of hand. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Grotesque and imitative work of the utmost perfection is produced, and many of the carvings of these countries, Japan in particular, are beautiful works of art, especially when the carver copies the lotus, lily or other aquatic plant. A favorite form of decoration consists of breaking up the architectural surfaces, such as ceilings, friezes, and columns, into framed squares and filling each panel with a circle, or diamond of conventional treatment with a spandrels in each corner. &lt;!-- image of door of Tai-h Hall, Pekin--&gt; A very Chinese feature is the finial of the newel post, so constantly left more or less straight in profile and deeply carved with monsters and scrolls. A heavily enriched moulding bearing a strong resemblance to the gadroon pattern is commonly used to give emphasis to edges, and the dragon arranged in curves imitative of nature is frequently employed over a closely designed and subordinated background.

[[File:Vietnamese column.JPG|thumb|left|Detail of a Vietnamese wooden column]]
The general rule that in every country designers use much the same means whereby a pattern is obtained holds good in China.{{Clarify|date=April 2012}} There are forms of band decoration here which closely resemble those of Gothic Europe, and a chair from Turkestan (3rd century) might almost be Elizabethan, so like are the details. Screens of grill form, often found in the historically Islamic countries, are common, and the deeply grounded, closely arranged patterns of Bombay also have their counterparts. The imperial dais in the Chien-Ching Hall, Pekin, is a masterpiece of intricate design. The back consists of one central panel of considerable height, with two of lesser degree on either side luxuriously carved. The whole is crowned with a very heavy crest of dragons and scroll work; the throne also is a wonderful example of carved treatment, and the doors of a cabinet in the same building show how rich an effect of foliage can be produced without the employment of stalk or scroll. One might almost say, he wastes his talent on such an ungrateful material as wood. In this material fans and other trifles are carved with a delicacy that courts disaster.

In Japan much of the Chinese type is apparent. The native carver is fond of massing foliage without the stalk to lead him. He appears to put in his foliage, fruit and flowers first and then to indicate a stalk here and there, thus reversing the order of the Western method. Such a treatment, especially when birds and beasts are introduced, has the highest decorative effect. But, as such close treatment is bound to do, it depends for success to some extent upon its scheme of color. A long panel in the Victoria and Albert Museum, depicting merchants with their packhorse, strongly resembles in its grouping and treatment Gothic work of the 15th century, as for example the panel of [[Hubertus|St Hubert]] in the museum at Chftlons. The strength and character of Japanese figure work is quite equal to the best Gothic sculpture of the 15th century.

&lt;!--was called savage races, but that is POV from 11th britannica --&gt;
There is a general similarity running through the carved design of most races of [[primitive culture]],{{POV statement|date=May 2012}} the [[chip carving|chip form of ornament]]{{clarify|date=January 2012}} being almost universally employed. Decorated surfaces depending almost entirely upon the incised line also obtain all over the world, and may no doubt be accounted for by the extensive use of stone cutting tools. The carver shows the same tendency to over-exalt his art by [[horror vacui|crowding on too much design]] as the more civilized craftsman of other lands, while he also on occasion exercises a good deal of restraint by a harmonious balance of decoration and plain space. So far as his chip designs and those patterns more or less depending on the line are concerned, his work as a rule is good and suitable, but when he takes to figure work his attempts do not usually meet with success. Primitive carving, generally, shows that very similar stages of artistic development are passed through by men of every age and race.

A very favorite style of chip pattern is that formed by small triangles and squares entirely covering a surface in the [[Cook Islands]], the monotony being sometimes varied by a band of different arrangement in the middle of the article or at the top or bottom. So far as the cultivation of patience and accuracy is concerned, has no equal. The [[Fiji|Fiji Islanders]], employ chip designs rivaling those of [[Europe]] in variety. Upon occasion the aboriginal [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]] carver appreciates the way in which plain surfaces contrast and emphasize decorated parts, and judiciously restricts his skill to bands of decoration or to special points. The [[Ijaw people|Ijos]] of the lower [[Niger Delta|Niger]] design their paddles in a masterly way, and show a fine sense of proportion between the plain and the decorated surface. Their designs, though slightly in relief, are of the chip nature. The method of decorating a subject with groups of incised lines, straight or curved, though often very effective and in every way suitable, is not a very advanced form of art and has decided limits. The natives of the Congo, now two nations, covered by the landmass of the [[Republic of the Congo]] and [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] does good work of this kind.

Carving in relief is common enough, idols being produced in many forms. The [[South African]] carves the handle of his spoon perhaps in the form of a [[giraffe]], and in the round, with each leg cut separately and the four hoofs meeting at the bowl, hardly a comfortable form of handle to hold. The [[Native Americans in the United States|North American Indian]] shows a wider invention than some nations, the twist in various shapes being a favorite treatment say of [[smoking pipe (tobacco)|pipe stems]]. The [[Papuan peoples|Papuan]] has quite a style of his own; he uses a scroll of the form familiar in Indian shawls, and in some cases the scroll entwines in a way which faintly suggests the [[Guilloché|guilloche]]. The [[Papuan people|native of New Guinea]] also employs the scroll for a motive, the flat treatment of which reminds one of a similar method in use in [[Scandinavia]]n countries. The work of the [[New Zealand]]er is greatly in advance of the average [[Primitive culture|primitive type]];{{POV statement|date=May 2012}} he uses a very good scheme of scroll work for decorative purposes, the lines of the scrolls often being enriched with a small pattern in a way reminding one of the familiar Norman treatment, as for example the prows of his canoes. The [[Māori people|Maori]] wood carver sometimes carves not only the barge boards of his house but the gables also, reptilian and grotesque figures being as a rule introduced; the main posts and rafters, too, of the inside receive attention. Unlike the [[Hindu]] he has a good idea of decorative proportion, and does not plan his scheme of design on too small a scale.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">'''Information art''' (also '''data art''' or '''informatism''') is an emerging field of [[electronic art]] that synthesizes [[computer science]], [[information technology]], and more classical forms of art, including [[performance art]], [[visual art]], [[new media art]] and [[conceptual art]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward A. Shanken]] has argued that little scholarship has explored the relationship between technology and [[conceptual art]]. He also claimed that there was an art-historical impetus to artificially distinguish information art from conceptual art. [[Edward A. Shanken]], 'Art in the Information Age: Technology and Conceptual Art,' in [[Michael Corris]] (ed.), Conceptual Art: Theory, Myth and Practice Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Information Art often includes [[interaction]] with [[computer]]s that generate artistic content based on the processing of large amounts of data.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Charlie Gere]] ''Art, Time and Technology: Histories of the Disappearing Body'' (Berg, 2005). {{ISBN|978-1-84520-135-7}} This text concerns artistic and theoretical responses to the increasing speed of technological development and operation, especially in terms of  draws on the ideas of [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Bernard Stiegler]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[André Leroi-Gourhan]], and looks at the work of [[Samuel Morse]], [[Vincent van Gogh]] and [[Kasimir Malevich]], among others.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[Image:Info1970.jpg|thumb|150px|Kynaston McShine's "Information"]]
Informatism follows on the 1970 exhibition organized by [[Kynaston McShine]] called  "Information", held at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York City - a show  that formally established [[conceptual art]] as a leading tendency in the United States. Conceptual art had emerged simultaneously in dozens of international locations around 1966.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Lucy R. Lippard]], ''Six Years: the Dematerialization of the Art Object From 1966 to 1972'' (1973. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time arose the activities of [[Experiments in Art and Technology]] known as E.A.T.&lt;ref&gt;E.A.T. followed from the event Nine Evenings: Theatre and Engineering, organised by [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Billy Klüver]] at the Armoury Building, New York City, 13–22 October 1966 to promote the collaboration between artists and engineers. They also organised the Pepsi Pavilion at the World's Fair, [[Osaka]], in 1970. For a detailed discussion of the project see Bijvoet, Art as Inquiry, ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic practice ==
Information art [[data]] can be manifested using [[photograph]]s, [[census]] data, micropayments, personal profiles and expressions, [[video]] clips, [[search engine]] results, [[digital painting]], network signals, and [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=McKeough, Tim|title=Frame That Spam!

'''Kearny Street Workshop''' (KSW) in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], is the oldest multidisciplinary arts [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] addressing [[Asian Pacific American]] issues. The organization's mission is to produce and present art that enriches and empowers Asian Pacific American communities. Notable participants include author and Asian American studies scholar [[Russell Leong]], playwright and author [[Jessica Hagedorn]], author [[Janice Mirikitani]], poet and historian [[Al Robles]], and actor and filmmaker [[Lane Nishikawa]]. 

== History ==

=== Origins ===
Kearny Street Workshop was founded as an artists' collective in 1972 in the [[International Hotel (San Francisco)|International Hotel]] (I-Hotel) on San Francisco's [[Kearny Street]]. The founders Jim Dong, Lora Joh Foo, and Mike Chin and other early leaders were involved in the [[Asian American movement]], a [[Civil Rights Movement]]-inspired period of organizational and community building in the 1970s. The [[National Endowment for the Arts]] provided some initial funding through the Neighborhood Arts Program (NAP), an initiative of the [[San Francisco Arts Commission]]. Though the founders were initially distrustful of government funds, NAP liaison Bernice Bing and founder Jim Dong eventually agreed to use a $2,000 NAP grant to fund a graphics workshop for KSW participants.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/3935054|title=The art museum as educator : a collection of studies as guides to practice and policy|last=Arts.|first=Council on Museums and Education in the Visual|date=1978|publisher=University of California Press|others=Newsom, Barbara Y., Silver, Adele Z.|year=|isbn=9780520032484|location=Berkeley|pages=207|oclc=3935054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In its early days, KSW shared space with a dry goods store on the ground floor of the I-Hotel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mica.edu/About_MICA/Departments_and_Services/The_Center_for_Art_Education/Community_Arts_Journal/Visions_and_Voices_of_the_I-Hotel.html|title=Visions and Voices of the I-Hotel: Urban Struggles, Community Mythologies and Creativity {{!}} MICA|last=Art|first=Maryland Institute College of|website=www.mica.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization originally focused on cultivating [[Chinese Americans|Chinese American]] arts and activism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the organization quickly expanded to cater to a multiethnic constituency, holding classes for Asian American activists and artists to practice [[photography]], [[creative writing]], and [[silkscreen printing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maeda|first=Daryl Joji|date=2016-06-09|title=The Asian American Movement|url=http://americanhistory.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-21|language=en|doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199329175.001.0001/acrefore-9780199329175-e-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the first few years, hundreds of Bay-area students were attending classes, [[Salon (gathering)|salons]], workshops, and [[Exhibition|exhibitions]] each day.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Kearny Street Collective: Pioneering Workshop Turns 25|last=Hsuan|first=Bryan|date=September 11, 1997|work=Asianweek|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; KSW also opened Jackson Street Gallery in an adjacent I-Hotel storefront space in 1974, where Workshop members held exhibitions, poetry readings, and musical performances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Community activism ===
KSW played a key role in developing Asian American activist iconography during the I-Hotel anti-eviction movement. Students and other KSW members painted a block-long mural on the Jackson Street side of the I-Hotel in support of its tenants. Screenprinted posters advocating for the I-Hotel tenants' rights appeared throughout San Francisco's [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]], [[Little Manila|Manilatown]], and [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]] during the decade-long fight for the I-Hotel. Artists from KSW also aided in the anti-eviction protests by organizing [[Demonstration (protest)|rallies]], attending court hearings, hosting exhibitions on [[affordable housing]], and publishing [[poetry]] and pamphlets that depicted life in the I-Hotel.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

KSW also provided summer youth programming that was intended to provide a diversion from gang violence in Chinatown. Workshop members also spearheaded the development of the annual Hop Jok Fair, which not only promoted Asian American artwork, but introduced many low-income Chinatown residents to available social and health services.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

=== Eviction and relocation ===
In 1977, both residential and business tenants were evicted from the I-Hotel. The workshop's headquarters relocated to a small storefront in [[North Beach, San Francisco]]. However, this relocation separated the organization from its key communities and constituents in Chinatown and Manilatown.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

KSW was able to return to Chinatown by 1981, leasing a basement space in a hotel on Clay Street. During its time in this space, members organized the Asian American Jazz Festival as well as the Kearny Street Workshop Press.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1995, KSW was incorporated as a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] nonprofit organization and relocated to [[South Park, San Francisco]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 

KSW finally relocated to a gallery and performance space in San Francisco's [[South of Market, San Francisco|SoMa]] in 2006.

== Programs and exhibitions ==
KSW's past and present programs include a small poetry press, writers' workshops, visual arts, [[martial arts]], readings, music, gallery exhibitions, performances, and film screenings, as well as the Asian American Jazz Festival and the annual artists festival APAture.

=== Kearny Street Workshop Press ===
KSW's press published poetry by Bay-area Asian American authors such as Virginia Cerenio, Bob Hsiang, Jaime Jacinto, [[Genny Lim]], Lenny Limjoco, and Jeff Tagami.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openlibrary.org/publishers/Kearny_Street_Workshop_Press|title=Publisher: Kearny Street Workshop Press {{!}} Open Library|last=OpenLibrary.org|website=openlibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

=== Asian American Jazz Festival ===
KSW founded the Asian American Jazz Festival (AAJF) in 1981, with the help of organizers and KSW members George Leong and Paul Yamazaki.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.firstvoice.org/asian-american-jazz-festival/|title=Asian American Jazz Festival|website=Brenda Wong Aoki &amp; Mark Izu – Official Website|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until it ceased production in 2006, the AAJF was the longest continuously-running jazz festival in the San Francisco area. Notable participants include [[Mark Izu]], [[Fred Ho]], [[Vijay Iyer]], and [[Kim Jin-hi|Jin Hi Kim]]. 

=== APAture ===
APAture is an annual multidisciplinary arts festival founded in 2001. Its mission is to promote emerging artists of Asian and/or Pacific Islander descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kearnystreet.org/apature-faq/|title=APAture FAQ|website=Kearny Street Workshop|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable participants include [[Gene Luen Yang]], [[Ali Wong]], [[Hasan Minhaj]], and [[Jane Kim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.kmir.com/story/36320233/kearny-street-workshop-presents-over-60-emerging-asian-pacific-american-artists-in-the-16th-annual-apature-festival|title=Kearny Street Workshop Presents Over 60 Emerging Asian Pacific American Artists in the 16th Annual APAture Festival|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Comedy===
Carr has used a [[wheelchair]] since the age of seven due to [[arthrogryposis multiplex congenita]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ok.co.uk/tv/985756/saturday-kitchen-silent-witness-star-liz-carr-show-regular-clarissa-mullery-spoiler-emilia-fox "Silent Witness Star Liz Carr". OK Magazine. Olivia Wheeler. 21 January 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; and frequently refers to her condition in her stand-up as "meus thronus kaputus". She is frank about her life as a disabled person and the inherent comedy that brings – "I've had some tuts, which is fantastic... I look quite frail to some people, so it's like, 'She's talking about sex, she's swearing.' Every stereotype you didn't expect. People generally look terrified. 'Oh my God, is she going to be funny? Can we laugh at this?'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mary O'Hara |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jun/21/disability.socialcare |title=Interview: Liz Carr |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=21 June 2006 |accessdate=13 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been part of a number of comedy groups, including Abnormally Funny People with [[Tanyalee Davis]], [[Steve Day]], Steve Best, Simon Minty, and [[Chris McCausland]].

In 2007 she was runner up in the [[Hackney Empire New Act of the Year]] competition.&lt;ref name="Chortle"/&gt;

Carr co-hosted the [[BBC]]'s [[Royal Television Society]] award-winning ''Ouch! Podcast''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/podcast/ |title=Official ''Ouch!'' Podcast page |publisher=BBC |date=14 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Mat Fraser]] from 2006 to 2013, and in 2011 worked as a researcher for the [[BBC]] comedy panel show ''[[Have I Got News for You]]''.

===Acting===
Carr was in her thirties when she took on her first professional acting role playing [[Mother Courage]] before heading to the [[Young Vic]] with another [[Bertolt Brecht]] play, [[The Exception and the Rule]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/5kV9TqcRDr6jFhCy97LMSnj/clarissa-mullery BBC]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she joined the long-running [[BBC]] crime thriller series ''[[Silent Witness]]'' as regular character Clarissa Mullery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p012ychn |title=Liz Carr introduces her new character, ''Silent Witness'' |publisher=[[BBC One]] |date=21 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/ouch/2012/10/first_look_liz_carr_as_clariss.html |title=First look: Liz Carr as Clarissa Mullery in ''Silent Witness'' |work=The Ouch! Blog |publisher=BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==
For the past 20 years, Carr has been a disability rights campaigner in the UK and has spoken at many rallies.  In May 2008 she joined with [[ADAPT]], a prominent disability rights group in the United States, to raise money for ADAPT and to protest against presidential candidate [[John McCain]]'s refusal to support the right of people with disabilities to live in their own homes.

In 2011, Carr was part of a ''[[Newsnight]]'' debate on [[assisted suicide]], following the screening on the BBC of ''[[Terry Pratchett: Choosing to Die]]'', which included [[Jeremy Paxman]] and [[David Aaronovitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title |id=1975600 |title=Choosing to Die: ''Newsnight'' Debate |date=1 January 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She opposes [[Charlie Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Lord Faulkner]]'s [[Assisted Dying Bill]], stating: "I fear we’ve so devalued certain groups of people – ill people, disabled people, older people – that I don’t think it’s in their best interests to enshrine in law the right of doctors to kill certain people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liz Carr, Not so ''Silent Witness'' |work=Standard Issue |url=http://standardissuemagazine.com/voices/liz-carr-interview/ |date=3 December 2014 |author=Hannah Dunleavy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
Carr was born in [[Port Sunlight]] and grew up in Bebington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Keith|title=Merseyside actress attacked by man armed with SCISSORS|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/liverpool-news/merseyside-actress-attacked-man-armed-13485356|website=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=18 August 2017|date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Upton Hall School FCJ]] in [[Upton, Merseyside]]. and [[Birkenhead High School Academy|Birkenhead High School]] in Birkenhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='This has everything to do with disability': Interview with Wirral-born Silent Witness actress Liz Carr on subject of assisted suicide – The Diocese of Shrewsbury – The Diocese of Shrewsbury|url=http://www.dioceseofshrewsbury.org/news/latest-news/everything-disability-interview-wirral-born-silent-witness-actress-liz-carr-subject-assisted-suicide|publisher=dioceseofshrewsbury.org|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Hara|first1=Interview by Mary|title=No fear, no frills|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2006/jun/21/disability.socialcare|website=The Guardian|accessdate=18 August 2017|date=21 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Carr entered into a [[civil partnership in the United Kingdom|civil partnership]] with longtime partner Jo Church in what Carr called "A Wheelie Special Wedding". Her father gave a speech in which he was prohibited from using words like "brave". Carr and her partner danced to the ''[[Dirty Dancing]]'' theme and the local fire brigade held her, and her chair, aloft.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/ouch/features/a_wheelie_special_wedding.shtml A Wheelie Special Wedding], Liz Carr, 2010, BBC.

On 10 August 2017, Carr and her personal assistant were the victims of an attack by a man armed with scissors. The assailant was subsequently arrested and detained under the [[Mental Health Act 2007|Mental Health Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-40946659 |title=Liz Carr: Silent Witness star attacked with scissors |publisher=BBC News  |date=16 August 2017 |accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The main feature of Lolita fashion is the volume of the skirt,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thelolitaguidebook.tumblr.com/anatomy|title=''Volume 3: The Anatomy of an Outfit'' on ''The Lolita Guide Book''|publisher=Tumblr|accessdate=11 February 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808152925/http://thelolitaguidebook.tumblr.com/anatomy|archivedate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; often created by wearing a [[petticoat]] or [[crinoline]]. The skirt can be either clock-shaped or A-shaped.&lt;ref name="K. Robinson 2014 p. 39"&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States, Georgia State University, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Components of the Lolita wardrobe consist mainly of a [[blouse]] (long or short sleeves) with a skirt or a dress, which usually comes to the knees. Lolitas frequently wear fashion wigs in combination with other headwear such as hair bows or a bonnet (similar to a [[Poke bonnet]]). Lolitas sometimes also wear Victorian style drawers under their petticoats. For further effect, knee socks, ankle socks or tights together with either [[High-heeled footwear|high heels]] or flat shoes with a bow are worn. Other typical Lolita garments are a [[Jumper (dress)|jumperskirt]] (JSK) and one-piece (OP).&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J.

== History ==
Although the origin of the fashion is unclear, it is likely that the movement started at the end of the 1960s with the fashion style and subculture Natural Kei, which romanticized the [[Victorian era|Victorian Period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fyeahlolita.blogspot.be/2013/11/why-is-lolita-called-lolita-does-lolita.html|title=''Why is Lolita called "Lolita"?

Lolita is seen as a reaction against stifling Japanese [[society]], in which young people are pressured to strictly adhere to [[gender role]]s and the expectations and responsibilities that are part of these roles.&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R.

== Social-economical dimension ==
Much of the very early lolitas in the 1990s hand-made most of their clothing, and were inspired by the [[Japanese street fashion#Dolly kei|Dolly Kei movement]] of the previous decade.&lt;ref name="hdl.handle.net"/&gt; Because of the diffusion of fashion magazines people were able to use lolita patterns to make their own clothing.{{Citation needed|reason=Where has this been said again?|date=March 2018}} Another way to own lolita was to buy it second-hand.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The do-it-yourself behaviour can be seen more frequently by people who cannot afford the expensive brands.&lt;ref&gt;http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15944/ S. Abigail Staite (2012) Atemporal Class-Play With tea and cakes, University of Tasmania, Australia, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because more retails stores were selling lolita fashion the do-it-yourself behaviour became less important.{{Citation needed|reason=
Where has this been said again?|date=March 2018}} Partly due to the rise of [[e-commerce]] and [[globalization]] it became possible to buy lolita clothing by Internet. The market was quickly divided into two main components: one which purchases mainly from Japanese or Chinese internet marketplaces, the other making use of shopping services to purchase Japanese brands,&lt;ref name="Young Kang &amp; T. Diane Cassidy (2015) pp. 371-384."/&gt; with some communities making larger orders as a group.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Not every online shop delivers quality lolita (inspired) [[Product (business)|products]], a notorious example is Milano (2014).&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; with some web shops selling brand replicas, a frowned upon behaviour from many in this community.&lt;ref name="Chancy J.

Gatlin 2014 p. 93"/&gt;

== Social-cultural dimension ==
Many lolitas considered being photographed without permission to be rude and disrespectful,&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K.

Hardy Bernal (2011) ''The Lolita Complex: a Japanese fashion subculture and its paradoxes'', Auckland University of Technology, New Zealand, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  however some rules differ or overlap in different parts of this community.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K. Robinson (2014) ''Empowered Princesses: An Ethnographic Examination of the Practices, Rituals, and Conflicts within Lolita Fashion Communities in the United States'', Georgia State University, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; Lolitas often host meetings in public spaces such as parks, restaurants, cafes, shopping malls, public events, and festivals.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J. Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the Atlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, pp. 103–104.&lt;/ref&gt; Some meetings take place at members' homes, and often have custom house rules (e.g. each member must bring their own cupcake to the meeting).&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J. Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the Atlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Lolita meetings therefore are a social aspect of the lolita fashion community, serving as an opportunity for members to meet one another.{{Citation needed|reason=Where has this been said again?|date=March 2018}} Many lolitas also used to use [[Livejournal]] to communicate, but many have switched to [[Facebook]] groups in the interim.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_theses/87/ Chancy J.

== Confusions ==
Lolita fashion did not emerge until after the publication of the novel ''[[Lolita]]'' (1955),&lt;ref name="Young Kang &amp; T. Diane Cassidy (2015) pp. 371-384."/&gt;&lt;ref name="M.

Gatlin (2014) ''The Fashion of Frill: The Art of Impression Management in the wAtlanta Lolita and Japanese Street Fashion Community'', Georgia State University, United States of America, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the book focused on the controversial subject of pedophilia and underage sexuality, lolita soon developed a [[Pejorative|negative connotation]] referring to a girl inappropriately sexualized at a very young age&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R. Hinton (2013) "Returning in a Different Fashion:
Culture, Communication, and Changing Representations of Lolita in Japan and the West", ''International Journal of Communication'' 7, 1582–1602, p. 1585.&lt;/ref&gt; and associated with unacceptable sexual obsession.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.gsu.edu/anthro_hontheses/11/ K.

''Lolita'' was made into a movie in [[Lolita (1962 film)|1962]], which was sexualized and did not show the disinterest that Lolita had in sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;http://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc/article/view/1333 Perry R. Hinton (2013) "Returning in a Different Fashion: Culture, Communication, and Changing Representations of Lolita in Japan and the West", ''International Journal of Communication'' 7, 1582–1602, pp. 1584–1585.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/25/lolita-fashion/|title=Lolita Fashion|publisher=''The Paris Review''|accessdate=6 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170806085224/https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/25/lolita-fashion/ |archivedate=6 August 2017|date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A remake was made in [[Lolita (1997 film)|1997]]. The 17 year old [[Amy Fisher]], who attempted to murder the wife of her 35-year-old lover and whose crime was made into a film called ''[[The Amy Fisher Story]]'' (1993), was often called the Long Island Lolita.

Monden (2008) "Transcultural Flow of Demure Aesthetics: Examining Cultural Globalisation through Gothic &amp; Lolita Fashion", The Japan Foundation Sydney, ''New Voices'' Volume 2, 21–40, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor is that Western culture considers wearing cute clothing when adult to be childish, associating lolita with paedophile fantasies. In contrast, it is more acceptable for cuteness to be part of fashion in Japan.&lt;ref name="M. Monden 2008 p. 34"/&gt;

The [[Lolita complex]] (also known as Lolicon) in writing about Lolita in sexual context,.&lt;ref&gt;http://repository.wellesley.edu/thesiscollection/391/ K.

Coombes (2016) p. 36"/&gt; and refers to paedophile desires.&lt;ref name="K. Coombes (2016) p. 36"/&gt; This expression of the Lolita complex can be found back in the nineties when school uniforms became a central object of desire&lt;ref name="Sharon Kinsella 2002"&gt;https://dx.doi.org/10.2752/136270402778869046 Sharon Kinsella (2002) What's Behind the Fetishism of Japanese School Uniforms?, Fashion Theory, 6:2, 215-237.&lt;/ref&gt; and young girls were pictured as sexual in [[manga]].&lt;ref name="Sharon Kinsella 2002"/&gt;

Within Japanese culture the name refers to cuteness and elegance rather than to sexual attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;http://nccur.lib.nccu.edu.tw/handle/140.119/79821 A.

Another confusion that often occurs is between the Lolita fashion style and [[cosplay]]. Although both spread from Japan, they are different and should be perceived as independent from each other;&lt;ref&gt;http://eprints.utas.edu.au/15944/ S. Abigail Staite (2012) Lolita: Atemporal Class-Play With tea and cakes, University of Tasmania, Australia, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; one is a fashion style while the other is role-play, with clothing and accessory being used to play a character. This does not exclude that there may be some overlap between members of both groups.&lt;ref&gt;''De opkomst van de mangacultuur in België. Een subcultuuronderzoek.'', Lora-Elly Vannieuwenhuysen, p. 48, KU Leuven, 2014-2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen at [[anime conventions]] such as the convention in Götenborg in which cosplay and Japanese fashion is mixed.&lt;ref&gt;http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:su:diva-62778 K.

'''Lucille Caudill Little''' (August 20, 1909 &amp;ndash; October 8, 2002), a [[Patronage#Arts|patron of the arts]] and philanthropist who served as president of the W. Paul and Lucille Caudill Little Foundation in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].

==Biography==
Mary Lucille Caudill was born in 1909 in [[Morehead, Kentucky|Morehead]], the county seat of [[Rowan County, Kentucky]]. She was one of five children (sisters Dr. Claire Louise Caudill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kentuckystewarts.com/RowanCounty/LouiseCaudill1994.htm | title = Louise Caudill | accessdate=2011-05-30 | publisher = Alexander Stewart Family of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Patricia Caudill Eubank; and, brothers Boone Proctor Caudill and Dr. Charles Milton Caudill) of Rosetta Proctor and Judge Daniel Boone Caudill.  Her father was a lawyer and a banker as well as a popular circuit judge of the Twenty-First District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kentuckystewarts.com/RowanCounty/CaudillElectionDispute1933.htm | title = 1933 Rowan County Election Dispute 1933 | accessdate=2011-05-30 | publisher = Alexander Stewart Family of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She attended elementary and high school in [[Morehead, Kentucky|Morehead]] and graduated from [[Hamilton College (Kentucky)|Hamilton College]], a girls finishing school in [[Lexington, Kentucky]]. In the 1920s she attended eleven colleges, including [[Transylvania College]], the [[University of Kentucky]], Morehead College (now [[Morehead State University]]), and studied voice at [[Stetson College]] in Florida.  She was a member of [[Pi Beta Phi]], having been initiated into the chapter at the Ohio State University.&lt;ref&gt;''Directory of Pi Beta Phi'', 1951, p. 98. Her sister Dr. C. Louise Caudill was also a member of the Ohio Beta (Ohio State University) Chapter of Pi Beta Phi.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 she earned a bachelor's degree in voice from [[Ohio State University]], took graduate courses at [[Columbia University]] and then at [[Juilliard School of Music]] (where she earned a scholarship). She continued her studies in New York with vocal scientist Dr. Douglas Stanley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEvX3VYay8g | title = Douglas Stanley &amp; Nelson Eddy vocal technique demonstration | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | date = 2009-09-01 | publisher = YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Lily Pons]] as accompanist. After performing in New York, she served on the faculty of [[Morehead State University|Morehead State Teachers College]] where she taught speech and started up the department of theatre. Later, she served as a volunteer teacher at a P-12 private school in Lexington, [[Sayre School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ket.org/arts/lucillelittle.htm | title = Lucile Caudill Little | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | publisher = Kentucky Educational Television}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She married W. Paul Little, a businessman and thoroughbred breeder, in 1937 at the age of 28 and they made [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]], in the heart of the Bluegrass state, their home. Paul Little was a successful thoroughbred breeder and owner, having bred Wild Again and 28 other stakes winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bloodhorse.com/horse-racing/articles/11957/lexington-philanthropist-wife-of-breeder-paul-little-dead-at-93 | title = Lexington Philanthropist, Wife of Breeder Paul Little, Dead at 93 | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | last = Goode | first = Kristin Ingwell | date = 2002-10-09 | publisher = The Blood-Horse.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979 she was kidnapped by a young man whose father worked at Paul Little's tobacco warehouse in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].  She went to the bank to collect her own ransom of $85,000 and told the police.  They followed and, while she was on the floor in the backseat of her own car, exchanged fire with the kidnapper.

After her husband's death in 1990, Mrs. Little was the sole heir to a large fortune. In 1999, the W. Paul &amp; Lucille Caudill Little Foundation was the 9th-ranked foundation in Kentucky by total dollars donated.&lt;ref name="Lane"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kentuckystewarts.com/RowanCounty/LucilleCaudill.htm | title = Lucille Caudill: 'I Have Called Myself a College Tramp' | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | last = Lane | first = Ed | date = October 2001 | work = One-on-One | publisher = The Alexander Stewart Family of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philanthropy==
Because of her training in the arts, Little focused the Paul &amp; Lucille Caudill Little Foundation in the areas of the arts and education.  The purpose of the foundation is to develop creativity mainly through the fine arts.  The Foundation was originally handled by the Bank of the Bluegrass and Trust Company, and today by the [http://bgcf.org Blue Grass Community Foundation]. Gifts are awarded quarterly to nonprofit organizations that have been in existence for at least three years.  The organizations must serve in and around Central and Eastern Kentucky, specifically Fayette, Rowan or Elliott County. Grants tend to range in amount from $5,000 to $1 million. In May 2011, however, the Foundation announced the largest awards ever presented: $2.5 million each for the Lexington Children's Theatre (Shooting Star Youtheatre outreach to Rowan and Elliott Counties) and for Morehead State University's scholarships for students primarily from Rowan or Elliott County who pursue a bachelor of arts degree in art, music or theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.lanereport.com/articles/fastlane_article.cfm?id=263 | title = Little Foundation bestows $2.5M apiece to endow Morehead State, Lexington Children's Theater to promote drama in Rowan, Elliott counties | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | date = 2011-05-25 | work = The Lane Report | publisher = Lane Communications Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation established a permanent endowment at [[Kentucky Educational Television]] to integrate the performing arts into Kentucky's elementary education.

Even larger projects include a $1-million donation to the University of Kentucky in the 1990s to establish a combined fine arts library.  Her gift was matched by Mr. William T. Young and the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education's Research Challenge Initiative, resulting in the Lucille Caudill Little Fine Arts Library and the Learning Center Fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.uky.edu/Libraries/libpage.php?lweb_id=104&amp;llib_id=7&lt;ab_id=611 | title = About the Lucille Little Library | accessdate = 2011-05-30 | date = 2010-03-03 | publisher = University of Kentucky}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Little Library is the home of the [http://www.uky.edu/FineArts/Music/Niles John Jacob Niles Center for American Music].

The Lucille C. Little Theater at Transylvania University, where she was a member of the class of 1928. Another gift of $1 million to the Kentucky Horse Park Foundation will endow the International Museum of the Horse with the W. Paul Little Cultural and Learning Center. She has endowed the Lillian H. Press Distinguished Speakers Series at [[Centre College]], and recently gave $100,000 to the Commonwealth Institute for Parent Leadership.

Mrs. Little conceived the horse-themed pendulum clock which was installed in Lexington's central branch of the public library.

When asked why she chose to give her donations to art organizations, she replied:

:I wish people could feel the power of the arts. That the arts can be in their living. It has been such a power in my life and has led me into such beautiful pathways, that I would like everybody to have the experience.&lt;ref name="Lane" /&gt;

==Awards==
Little received honorary doctorate degrees from [[Transylvania University]], [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]], the [[University of Kentucky]], and [[Morehead State University]].

'''Malay folklore'''  refers to a series of knowledge, traditions and taboos that have been passed down through many generations in oral, written and symbolic forms among the indigenous populations of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]] ([[Nusantara]]). They include among others, themes and subject matter related to the indigenous knowledge of the [[ethnic Malays]] and related ethnic groups within the region.

The stories within this system of lore often incorporate supernatural entities and magical creatures which form parts of the Malay mythology. Others relate to creation myths and place naming legends that are often inter-twined with historical figures and events. Ancient rituals for healing and traditional medicine as well as complex philosophies regarding health and disease can also be found.

== Oral tradition ==
The oral forms of this lore are transmitted primarily through nursery rhymes, folksongs, theatrical exhibitions, and stories that are commonly told from parent to child. Nomadic storytellers that would roam the temples, marketplaces and palace courts also play a large part in the insemination of the oral traditions throughout the populace, often accompanied by music as well through forms of composed poetry and prose. The oral traditions are often integrated with moral values and some may also include stories of talking animals.

===Folk music (''lagu rakyat'')===
Of all the types of oral transmission, those in the form of music appear to be most pervasive in Malay society. Songs and melodies from times of old are sung and resung on a regular basis during festivities such as weddings, celebrations of motherhood and childbirth, rites of passage and  at cultural or religious celebrations. They are also utilized in the occasional ceremonial functions in royal weddings, in rites of ascension (or [[coronation]]) and royal birthday celebrations; in the form of the more refined court music.

Every region or each of the states may employ different versions of oral transmission but the most popular is in the form of folk-singing or ''lagu rakyat''. The Middle Eastern-influenced ''ghazal'' can be heard in the southern Malaysian state of [[Johor]] especially is the district of [[Muar (district)|Muar]]. Poets and singers consisting of often females and sometimes males vocalize popular love poems and riddles in the form of [[pantun]] to the accompaniment of a composition and  of music made for a six-stringed Arabian lute (see [[oud]]), Indian [[tabla]]s, Western [[violins]], accordion and [[marracas]].&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Wendy. 1995. This is Malaysia. New Holland Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of nursery rhymes and lullabies are also sung at weddings and cultural festivals in the state of [[Melaka]] by Malays and the Malay-speaking [[Peranakan]] communities. The contents of the songs are mostly to do with advise on love, life and marriage and are affectionately known in Malay as ''dondang sayang'' meaning "song of love".

Within each of these folk-songs, messages and stories are told, a kind of informal handing down of wisdom from the old to the young in the form of poetry which may include any of these:
* [[Pantun]] - a poem with four stanzas, two of each rhymes with each other
* [[Syair]] - a poem also with four stanzas, with all ends rhyming together
* Seloka - a poem, similar to ''pantun''
* Madah - a kind of rhyming speech, a discourse through poetry
* [[Gurindam]] - poetry, set to music

===Folksongs===
The Malay oral tradition includes a large collection of folksongs. Many of these songs are in the form of stories weaved into poetry or simple rhyme. These folksongs continue to be sung and a sizable number of them are included in the albums of modern-day singers, often with improvisations in terms of melody and more complex musical arrangements to suit a larger accompaniment of musicians as well as singers.

[[File:UlekMayangdance.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A dancer performing the ''Ulek Mayang''. Manifested in a dance and healing ceremony, it narrates a mystical tale about the sea spirits in a forbidden love with a fisherman.]]
Among the more well known Malay folksongs include:
* ''Anak Itek Tok Wi''
* ''Apo Kono Eh Jang''
* ''Bunga Hutan''
* ''Can Mali Can''
* ''Damak''
* ''Di Tanjong Katong''
* ''Ewah Bule''
* ''Ikan Kekek''
* ''Istana Bunian''
* ''Itek Gembo-gembo''
* ''Jong Inai''
* ''Kenek-kenek Udang''
* ''Ketipang Payong''
* ''Lanchang Kuneng''
* ''Londeh Mak Londeh''
* ''Nak Dara Rindu''
* ''Nenek Si Bongkok Tiga''
* ''Suriram''
* ''Sri Mersing''
* ''Tanjong Puteri''
* ''Tudong Periok''
* ''Tumbok Kalang''
* ''[[Ulek mayang]]''
* ''Wau Bulan''

A number of these folksongs originally belong to a certain region within Southeast Asia and are sung by the populations within the area. However, due to the nature of inter-mingling and mutual co-migrations within these areas the folksongs may also be heard in places far from their original geographic origins.

===Bardic tales (''cerita penglipur lara'')===
[[File:Malaysia 250.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A view of [[Tasik Chini]] in [[Pahang]], where a dragon known as [[Naga Seri Gumum]] is believed to dwell.]]
Stories of love and romance of princes and princesses, kings and queens, and heroes and their damsels in distress (and often, damsels and their heroes in distress) have long filled the imaginations of ethnic Malays. The fact that numerous royal courts existed and still exist in Southeast Asia supplied the basis of the stories. Although many of these tales are replete with additions (or reductions) and may contain a certain measure of exaggeration as well as the expected variations that existed from one story teller to another, the value and the wisdom behind each story cannot be ignored.

These stories are often told by professional story tellers called ''penglipur lara'', which roughly translates to ''reliever of sorrows''. The few ''penglipur lara'' that exist today are often farmers or at least rural villagers. In the past, travelling ''penglipur lara'' would carry the stories from one ''[[kampung]]'' (village) to another, making the occasional stops at marketplaces, village squares as well as royal courts. The essence of the stories remain the same but sometimes, adjustments are made according to the individual story-teller's preference. For example, the ''penglipur lara'' version of the [[Ramayana]] changes many of the names and settings and casts [[Laksmana]] as a ''pawang'' or Malay shaman, as opposed to the literary [[Hikayat Seri Rama]] or the theatrical Hikayat Maharaja Wana which remained closer to the original [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]].

Among the well known stories that may fall into this category includes the following:
* ''Anak Buloh Betong''
* ''Batu Belah Batu Bertangkop''
* ''Bayagong''
* ''Lebai Malang''
* ''Mat Jenin''
* ''Naga Tasik Chini''
* ''Nenek Kebayan''
* ''Nujum Pak Belalang''
* ''Pak Kadok''
* ''Pak Pandir''
* ''Puteri Santubong Puteri Sejinjang''
* ''Raja Bersiong''
* ''Sang Kelembai''
* ''Si Bongkok''
* ''Si Luncai''
* ''[[Si Tanggang]]''
* ''Singapura Dilanggar Todak''

Many of these stories are also condensed and made into poetic songs. A fixed melody is set for each story to the extent that if a melody is played or sung in the absence of its wordings, a Malay would be able to instantly recall the title of the story or at least the name of the characters in the story.

===Animal fables (''cerita binatang'')===
Animal fables are often used to explain certain natural phenomena. Other times, they are simple moral tales. In almost all instances, the animals in these stories possess the ability to speak, reason and think like humans, similar to [[Aesop's Fables]].

The ''kancil'' or [[mouse-deer]] serves as the main character in a number of the stories. The Malays regard this humble animal in the highest esteem due to its ability to overcome obstacles and defeat adversaries despite of its rather small and benign appearance. The mouse-deer appears in the state herald of [[Melaka]] and even plays a part in the legend of Malacca's founding.

Below are listed some of the common fables as well as their approximate title translations. (Note that the word ''sang'', an [[Old Malay]] honorific meaning "revered", appears in all instances preceding the name ''kancil'' to indicate respect)
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Buaya'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the crocodile
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Monyet'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the monkey
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Harimau'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the tiger
* ''Kisah Sang Kancil dengan Sang Sempoh'' - The tale of the mouse-deer and the bison
* ''Kisah Anjing dengan Bayang-bayang'' - The dog and the shadow
* ''Kisah Burung Gagak dan Merak'' - The crow and the peacock
* ''Kisah Burung Gagak yang Haus'' - The thirsty crow
* ''Kisah Labah-labah Emas'' - The golden spider
* ''Kisah Labah-labah dengan Burung Merpati'' - The spider and the pigeon
* ''Kisah Kerengga dengan Pemburu'' - The fire-ant and the hunter
* ''Kisah Burung Murai'' - The mockingbird
* ''Kisah Burung Kakak Tua'' - The cockatoo

===Ghost stories (''cerita hantu'')===
{{Main|Malay ghost myths}}
Malays, as with other Southeast Asians, have always taken great interest in stories of ghosts and spirits. It must be stressed that due to the animistic root of Malay folklore, these ghosts are seen as sharing the plane of existence with humans and are not always considered evil. However, when the delicate line that separates the boundaries of existence is crossed, or a transgression of living spaces occurs, a conflict ensues that may result in disturbances such as [[Spirit possession|possession]]s.

The Malay word for ghost is ''hantu''. However, this word also covers all sorts of demons, goblins and undead creatures and are thought to have real physical bodies, instead of just apparitions or spectres. The most famous of these is the ''[[Pontianak (folklore)|pontianak]]'' or ''matianak'', the ghost of a female stillborn child which lures men in the form of a beautiful woman.

Below are listed other popular supernatural beings and ghosts as well as their descriptions.
* ''Bajang'': the spirit of a stillborn child in the form of a [[civet]] cat (''musang'').
* ''Bota'': a type of evil spirit, usually a giant
* ''Hantu galah'': a ghost with legs and arms as long and slender as bamboo poles.
* ''Hantu kopek'': a female ghost with large bosoms who lures men who cheat on their wives
* ''Hantu kum-kum'': the ghost of an old woman who sucks the blood of virgin girls to regain her youth.
* ''Hantu lilin'': a wandering spirit that carries a torch or a lit candle at night
* ''Hantu Pemburu'': the Spectral Huntsman whose head is always looking upwards with a shoot growing from his neck
* ''Hantu punjut'': a ghost that takes children who wander into the forest late at night
* ''Hantu tinggi'': lit. "tall ghost", a type of giant that will flee at the sight of a naked body
* ''Jembalang'': a demon or evil spirit that usually brings disease
* ''Lang suir'': the mother of a [[pontianak (folklore)|pontianak]]. Able to take the form of an owl with long talons, and attacks pregnant women out of jealousy
* ''Mambang'': animistic spirits of various natural phenomena
* ''[[Orang minyak]]'': a cursed man covered in oil, who rapes women at night
* ''[[Pelesit]]'': a type of grasshopper that precedes the polong's arrival.
* ''[[Penanggal]]'': a flying head with its disembodied stomach sac dangling below. Sucks the blood of infants.
* ''Penunggu'': tutelary spirits of particular places such as caves, forests and mountains.
* ''[[Pocong]]'': a ghost wrapped in white burial shroud

* ''Toyol'': the spirit of a stillborn child, appears as a naked baby or toddler

== Written forms ==
{{Main|Malay literature}}
Malay folklore that appear as written traditions are often called ''[[hikayat]]'', ''kisah'' or ''dongeng''. The oldest of them were written in [[Old Malay]] using the prevailing scripts of the time, such as [[Sanskrit]], [[Pallava]] or [[Kawi language|Kawi]]. From around the 14th century onward, they were written in [[Classical Malay]] using [[Jawi script]] which prevailed ever since the arrival of Islam until the colonial era. During this time, the Malay royal courts became the centre for learning where scribes record the genealogy of kings and queens as well as historical events.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Wendy. 1995. This is Malaysia. New Holland Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epics (''hikayat'')===
The ''[[hikayat]]'' or epics are collections of stories and legends of heroism that often involve mythological and historical figures in a setting usually engaging the role of protagonists and antagonists. The [[Hikayat Hang Tuah]] and the story of [[Hang Jebat]] are among the most well known ''hikayat'' which are often told and retold in various forms such children's books, films, theatre plays and musical productions. The choice of who were to be portrayed as the protagonists and who were to be portrayed as the antagonists usually lies with the alignment of the storyteller, although most commonly, bards tend to maintain a stance of neutrality and dispassion in their story telling. In the stories of Hang Tuah and Hang Jebat for example, the lawful Hang Tuah may be portrayed as the hero, while sometimes, the non-lawful Hang Jebat may assume that role.
[[File:AbdullahbinAbdulKadir-HikayatAbdullah-1849.jpg|thumb|A page from the first edition of ''Hikayat Abdullah'' in the [[Jawi script]]. Published in 1849, it is a personal autobiography of [[Abdullah bin Abdul Kadir]], a [[Malacca]]-born [[munshi]] of [[Singapore]].]]

Other notable ''hikayat'' include:
* ''[[Hikayat Seri Rama]]'' or ''Hikayat Megat Seri Rama''
* ''[[Mahabharata|Hikayat Pandawa Lima]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Patani]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Inderaputera]]''
* ''Hikayat Inderajaya''
* ''[[Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Raja-raja Pasai]]''
* ''Hikayat Malim Deman''
* ''Hikayat Andaken Penurat''
* ''Hikayat Iskandar''
* ''[[Hikayat Amir Hamzah]]'' or ''Hikayat Hamzah''
* ''Hikayat Isma Yatim''
* ''Hikayat Muhammad Hanafiah''
* ''[[Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Abdullah]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Panca Tanderan]]''
* ''[[Hikayat Bayan Budiman]]''
* ''Hikayat Cekel Waneng Pati''

===Fairy tales (''kisah dongeng'')===
''Kisah dongeng'' are a loose collection of bedtime stories, fables and myths that involves human or non-human characters, often with superhuman powers along with talking animals, and an unearthly setting.

In this category, the story of ''[[Puteri Gunung Ledang]]'', ''[[Bawang Putih Bawang Merah]]'' and ''Batu Belah Batu Bertangkup'' is well known by the Malays. All three have been made into movies, albeit with differing interpretations and settings.

====Humanoid beings====

Characters with human-likeness abound in these stories. They are collectively referred to as ''orang halus'' meaning the "refined folk" or "soft folk" (often erroneously translated as "elves"). Most are invisible to the average human.

* '''[[Orang Bunian]]''': "hidden people" or "whistling people"; a race of exceptional beauty and grace.
* '''Orang ketot''': humans with short stature, similar to [[Dwarf (mythology)|dwarves]]
* '''Orang kenit''': small humans, often possessing magic powers
* '''Gergasi''': giants or ogres
* '''Gedembai''' or '''Kelembai''': an ogre who has the power to turn things to stone.
* '''Duyong''': [[mermaid]]s, having the lower body of a fish and a woman's upper body
* '''Bidadari''': beautiful heavenly nymphs

====Lycanthropic beings====

* '''Harimau jadian''' or '''harimau akuan''': [[Werecat|were-tiger]], were-leopard or were-panther
* '''Ular tedung jadian''': were-cobra
* '''Lembu jadian''': were-bull

====Mythical birds====

* '''[[Garuda|Geroda]]''': a bird made of fire
* '''Jentayu''': a bird made of water
* '''Cenderawasih''': also known as the Bird of Paradise, considered to be king of the birds; Guardian of a sacred jewel in '''[[Hyang|Kahyangan]]''', lit. ''the Abode of the Gods''.

====Beasts====

* '''[[Nāga|Naga]]''': a dragon said to inhabit caves and watery areas
* '''Raja udang''' ''lit. King of Prawns'': a very large prawn or lobster-like creature
* '''Hantu Belangkas''': a gigantic king-crab that attacks people at sea.

====Middle Eastern and Persian additions====

Later folk stories adopted elements from the Islamic world, of Middle Eastern and Persian origin but having arrived by way of Muslims from [[India]]. They differ somewhat from their Arabian counterparts due to the fact that what Malays now refer to as angels or demons were originally animistic spirits and deities.

* '''Jin''': [[Djinn]]
* '''Syaitan''': Satan
* '''Pari-pari''' or '''[[peri]]''': Faries
* '''Malaikat''': [[Angel]] (Religion-related)
* '''Bidadari/Bidadara''': Woman/Man Angel

== Symbolic lore ==
Apart from the stories and songs, Malay folklore also includes traditions, rituals and taboos related to the physical as well as the more metaphysical realms of the Malay world view. Such knowledge are usually presented in the forms of symbols and signs inscribed or built into temple walls, palaces, houses and often appear on stone inscriptions as well as grave markers. Natural symbolism are also important such as flowers, trees, animals, the sea as well as celestial objects such as the moon and stars. Malays also have knowledge of a series of constellations that are markedly different from the Indian system upon which it is based. Object symbolism such as wood carvings of animals, ancestral images, mythical beings and masks are also common in Malay society.

Symbolic forms of folklore are usually the domains of the spirits and are therefore sometimes employed by the traditional healers and shamans. The Malays have been known to employ supernatural forces for healing as well as in the aiding of child-birth, the curing of poisons and in the warding off of spirits. Due to the [[Islamic revival|Islamization movement]] of recent decades, these practices are not very well-documented in Malay, but have been recorded in some Western sources.

'''''Modernisme''''' ({{IPA-ca|muðərˈnizmə}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] for "modernism"), also known as '''[[Catalan people#Culture and society|Catalan]] modernism''', is the historiographic denomination given to an art and literature movement associated with the search of a new entitlement of Catalan culture, one of the most predominant cultures within [[Spain]]. Nowadays it is considered a movement based on the cultural reivindication of a ''catalan identity''. Its main form of expression was in architecture, but many other arts were involved (painting, sculpture, etc.), and especially the design and the decorative arts (cabinetmaking, carpentry, forged iron, ceramic tiles, ceramics, glass-making, silver and goldsmith work, etc.), which were particularly important, especially in their role as support to architecture. Modernisme was also a literary movement (poetry, fiction, drama). 

Although Modernisme was part of a general trend that emerged in [[Europe]] around the [[Fin de siècle|turn of the 20th century]], in [[Catalonia]] the trend acquired its own unique personality. Modernisme's distinct name comes from its special relationship, primarily with [[Catalonia]] and [[Barcelona]], which were intensifying their local characteristics for socio-ideological reasons after the revival of Catalan culture and in the context of spectacular urban and industrial development. It is equivalent to a number of other [[fin de siècle]] art movements going by the names of [[Art Nouveau]] in [[France]] and [[Belgium]], [[Jugendstil]] in [[Germany]], [[Secession (art)|Sezession]] in [[Austria-Hungary]], [[Liberty style]] in [[Italy]] and Modern or [[Glasgow Style]] in [[Scotland]].

Modernisme was active from roughly 1888 (the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona|First Barcelona World Fair]]) to 1911 (the death of [[Joan Maragall]], the most important ''Modernista'' poet). The ''Modernisme'' movement was centred in the city of [[Barcelona]], though it reached far beyond, and is best known for its architectural expression, especially in the work of [[Antoni Gaudí]], but was also significant in sculpture, poetry, theatre and painting. Notable painters include [[Santiago Rusiñol]], [[Ramon Casas]],&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Robert (1993) 'Barcelona', London, {{ISBN|0-00-272167-8}}, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isidre Nonell]], [[Hermen Anglada Camarasa]], Joaquim Mir, [[Eliseu Meifrèn]], Lluïsa Vidal and Miquel Utrillo. Notable sculptors are [[Josep Llimona]], Eusebi Arnau and Miquel Blai.

==Main concepts==
[[File:Barcelona-gm4.jpg|thumb|right|Duana de Barcelona (Customs House), by [[Enric Sagnier]]]]

[[Catalan nationalism]] was an important influence upon ''Modernista'' artists, who were receptive to the ideas of [[Valentí Almirall]] and [[Enric Prat de la Riba]] and wanted Catalan culture to be regarded as equal to that of other European countries. Such ideas can be seen in some of Rusiñol's plays against the Spanish army (most notably ''[[L'Hèroe]]''), in some authors close to [[anarchism]] ([[Jaume Brossa]] and [[Gabriel Alomar]], for example) or in the articles of [[federalism|federalist]] anti-[[monarchism|monarchic]] writers such as [[Miquel dels Sants Oliver]]. They also opposed the traditionalism and religiousness of the [[Renaixença]] Catalan Romantics, whom they ridiculed in plays such as [[Santiago Rusiñol]]'s ''[[Els Jocs Florals de Canprosa]]'' (roughly, "The Poetry Contest of Proseland"), a satire of the revived [[Jocs Florals]] and the political milieu which promoted them.

''Modernistes'' largely rejected bourgeois values, which they thought to be the opposite of art. Consequently, they adopted two stances: they either set themselves apart from society in a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] or culturalist attitude (Decadent and Parnassian poets, Symbolist playwrights, etc.) or they attempted to use art to change society (''Modernista'' architects and designers, playwrights inspired by [[Henrik Ibsen]], some of [[Joan Maragall|Maragall]]'s poetry, etc.)

==Architecture and the plastic arts==
The earliest example of ''Modernista'' [[architecture]] is the café Castell dels tres Dragons designed by [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] in the Parc de la Ciutadella for the [[Exposición Universal de Barcelona|1888 Universal Exhibition]]. It is a search for a particular style for Catalonia drawing on Medieval and Arab styles. Like the currents known in other countries as [[Art Nouveau]], Jugendstil, Stile Liberty, Modern Style or [[Sezessionstil]], ''Modernisme'' was closely related to the English [[Arts and Crafts movement]] and the [[Gothic revival]]. As well as combining a rich variety of historically-derived elements, it is characterized by the predominance of the curve over the straight line, by rich decoration and detail, by the frequent use of vegetal and other organic motifs, the taste for asymmetry, a refined aestheticism and dynamic shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Solà-Morales, I, (1992) 'Arquitectura Modernista, fi de segle a Barcelona', Barcelona, {{ISBN|84-252-1563-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While Barcelona was the centre of ''Modernista'' construction, the Catalan industrial bourgeoisie built industrial buildings and summer residences - ''cases d'estiueig'' - in many Catalan towns, notably [[Terrassa]] and [[Reus]]. The textile factory which is now home to the Catalan national technical museum [[MNACTEC]] is an outstanding example.

[[File:Reptil Parc Guell Barcelona.jpg|thumb|right|'El drac' (dragon) in the [[Parc Güell]], by [[Antoni Gaudí]].]]
[[Antoni Gaudí]] is the best-known architect of this movement. Other influential architects were [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]], and later [[Josep Maria Jujol]], [[Rafael Guastavino]] and [[Enrique Nieto (architect)|Enrique Nieto]].&lt;ref&gt;Mackay, David, 'Modern architecture in Barcelona, 1854-1929', Barcelona, 1985. {{cite web |url=http://www.anglo-catalan.org/op/monographs/issue03.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425152348/http://www.anglo-catalan.org/op/monographs/issue03.pdf |archivedate=2012-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature==
In literature, ''Modernisme'' stood out the most in narrative. The ''nouvelles'' and novels of decadent writers such as [[Prudenci Bertrana]] (whose highly controversial ''[[Josafat (book)|Josafat]]'' involved a demented priest who ends up killing a prostitute), [[Caterina Albert]] (also known as Víctor Catala), author of bloody, expressionistic tales of rural violence, opposed to the idealisation of nature propugned by Catalan Romantics, or [[Raimon Casellas]] have been highly influential upon later Catalan narrative, essentially recovering a genre that had been lost due to political causes since the end of the Middle Ages. Those writers often, though not always, show influences from Russian literature of the 19th Century and also [[Gothic novel]]s. Still, works not influenced by those sources, such as [[Joaquim Ruyra]]'s slice-of-life tales of the North-Eastern Catalan coast are perhaps even more influential than that of the aforementioned authors, and Rusiñol's well-known ''[[L'auca del senyor Esteve]]'' (roughly "The Tale of Mr. Esteve"; an ''[[auca (cartoon)|auca]]'' is a type of illustrated [[Broadside (printing)|broadside]], similar to a one-sheet comic book) is an ironic critique of Catalan bourgeoisie more related to ironic, pre-Realist Catalan ''costumisme''.

In poetry, ''Modernisme'' closely follows Symbolist and Parnassian poetry, with poets frequently crossing the line between both tendencies or alternating between them. Another important strain of ''Modernista'' poetry is [[Joan Maragall]]'s "Paraula viva" (''Living word'') school, which advocated Nietzschean vitalism and spontaneous and imperfect writing over cold and thought-over poetry. Although poetry was very popular with the ''Modernistes'' and there were lots of poets involved in the movement, Maragall is the only ''Modernista'' poet who is still widely read today.

''Modernista'' theatre was also important, as it smashed the insubstantial regional plays that were popular in 19th century Catalonia. There were two main schools of ''Modernista'' theatre: social theatre, which intended to change society and denounce injustice—the worker stories of [[Ignasi Iglésias]], for example ''[[Els Vells]]'' ("The old ones"); the Ibsen-inspired works of [[Joan Puig i Ferreter]], most notably ''[[Aigües Encantades]]'' ("Enchanted Waters"); Rusiñol's antimilitaristic play ''[[L'Hèroe]]''—and symbolist theatre, which emphasised the distance between artists and the bourgeoisie—for example, Rusiñol's ''[[Cigales i Formigues]]'' ("Cicadas and Ants") or ''[[El Jardí Abandonat]]'' ("The Abandoned Garden").

==Linguistics==
''Modernista'' ideas impelled ''[[L'Avenç]]'' collaborator [[Pompeu Fabra]] to devise a new [[orthography]] for Catalan. However, only with the later rise of [[Noucentisme]] did his projects come to fruition and end the orthographic chaos which reigned at the time.

==Decline==
By 1910, ''Modernisme'' had been accepted by the bourgeoisie and had pretty much turned into a fad. It was around this time that [[Noucentisme|Noucentista]] artists started to ridicule the rebel ideas of ''Modernisme'' and propelled a more bourgeois art and a more right-of-center version of Catalan Nationalism, which eventually rose to power with the victory of the [[Regionalist League|Lliga Regionalista]] in 1912. Until [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]'s dictatorship suppressed all substantial public use of Catalan, Noucentisme was immensely popular in Catalonia. However, ''Modernisme'' did have a revival of sorts during the [[Second Spanish Republic]], with ''[[avant-garde]]'' writers such as [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] [[Joan-Salvat Papasseit]] earning comparisons to Joan Maragall, and the spirit of [[Surrealism|Surrealists]] such as [[Josep Vicent Foix]] or [[Salvador Dalí]] being clearly similar to the rebellion of the ''Modernistes'', what with Dalí proclaiming that Catalan Romanticist [[Àngel Guimerà]] was ''a putrefact pervert''. However, the ties between Catalan art from the 1930s and ''Modernisme'' are not that clear, as said artists were not consciously attempting to continue any tradition.

''Modernista'' architecture survived longer. The Spanish city of [[Melilla]] in Northern Africa experienced an economic boom at the turn of the 20th century, and its new bourgeoisie showed its riches by massively ordering ''Modernista'' buildings. The workshops established there by Catalan architect [[Enrique Nieto (architect)|Enrique Nieto]] continued producing decorations in this style even when it was out of [[fashion in Barcelona]], which results in Melilla having, oddly enough, the second largest concentration of ''Modernista'' works after Barcelona.

== UNESCO World Heritage ==
Some of the works of Catalan Modernism have been listed by [[UNESCO]] as [[World Cultural Heritage]]:

== Architects ==
There were more than 100 architects who made buildings of the ''Modernista'' style, three of whom are particularly well known for their outstanding buildings: [[Antoni Gaudí]], [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] and [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]].

* [[Antoni Gaudí]], who went beyond mainstream ''Modernisme'', creating a personal style based on observation of the nature and exploitation of traditional Catalan construction traditions. He was using regulated geometric shapes as the [[hyperbolic paraboloid]], the hyperboloid, the helicoid and the conoide.&lt;ref&gt;http://noticias.arq.com.mx/Detalles/9955.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lluís Domènech i Montaner]] created a genuine alternative architecture. Along with [[Josep Vilaseca i Casanovas]] he worked towards a modern and international style. Domènech continued on from Viollet-le-Duc, his work characterized by a mix of constructive rationalism and ornaments inspired in the Hispano-Arab architecture as seen in the [[Palau de la Música Catalana]], in the [[Hospital de Sant Pau]] or in the [[Institut Pere Mata]] of Reus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arteespana.com/arquitecturamodernista.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His Hotel Internacional at Passeig de Colom in Barcelona (demolished after the 1888 World Fair) was an early example of industrial building techniques.
* [[Josep Puig i Cadafalch]] was a Catalan architect, politician and historian who was involved in many projects to restore older buildings. One of his most well-known buildings is his rebuilding of the [[Casa Amatller]] in [[Passeig de Gràcia]]. It has elements in both the Catalan tradition and others originating in the [[Netherlands]] or the [[Germany|German]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. [[Neo-Gothic]] is also apparent in his Codorniu Winery (Caves Codorniu, 1904). He built Casa Amatller and [[Casa Trinxet]].

A '''mosaic''' is a piece of [[art]] or image made from the assembling of small pieces of colored [[glass]], stone, or other materials. It is often used in [[Decorative arts|decorative art]] or as [[interior decoration]]. Most mosaics are made of small, flat, roughly [[square]], pieces of stone or glass of different colors, known as ''[[tesserae]]''. Some, especially floor mosaics, are made of small rounded pieces of stone, and called "pebble mosaics".

Mosaics have a long history, starting in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 3rd millennium BC. Pebble mosaics were made in [[Tiryns]] in [[Mycenean civilisation|Mycenean]] Greece; mosaics with patterns and pictures became widespread in classical times, both in [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]]. Early Christian [[basilica]]s from the 4th century onwards were decorated with wall and ceiling mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 15th centuries; that tradition was adopted by the [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in the 12th century, by the eastern-influenced [[Republic of Venice]], and among the [[Rus' (people)|Rus]] in Ukraine. Mosaic fell out of fashion in the [[Renaissance]], though artists like [[Raphael]] continued to practise the old technique. Roman and Byzantine influence led Jewish artists to decorate 5th and 6th century synagogues in the [[Middle East]] with floor mosaics.

Mosaic was widely used on religious buildings and palaces in early [[Islamic art]], including Islam's first great religious building, the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], and the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]]. Mosaic went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century.

Modern mosaics are made by professional artists, street artists, and as a popular craft. Many materials other than traditional stone and ceramic tesserae may be employed, including shells, glass and beads.

The earliest known examples of mosaics made of different materials were found at a temple building in Abra, [[Mesopotamia]], and are dated to the second half of 3rd millennium BC. They consist of pieces of colored stones, shells and ivory. Excavations at [[Susa]] and [[Chogha Zanbil]] show evidence of the first glazed tiles, dating from around 1500 BC.&lt;ref name="HistoryOfIranianTile"&gt;[http://www.iranchamber.com/art/articles/tile_history1.php Iran: Visual Arts: history of Iranian Tile], Iran Chamber Society&lt;/ref&gt; However, mosaic patterns were not used until the times of [[Sassanid Empire]] and Roman influence.

Mythological subjects, or scenes of hunting or other pursuits of the wealthy, were popular as the centrepieces of a larger geometric design, with strongly emphasized borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Capizzi |first=Padre |title=Piazza Armerina: The Mosaics and Morgantina |year=1989 |publisher=International Specialized Book Service Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek figural mosaics could have been copied or adapted paintings, a far more prestigious artform, and the style was enthusiastically adopted by the Romans so that large floor mosaics enriched the floors of [[Hellenistic]] [[villa]]s and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] dwellings from Britain to [[Dura-Europos]]. Most recorded names of Roman mosaic workers are Greek, suggesting they dominated high quality work across the empire; no doubt most ordinary craftsmen were slaves.  Splendid mosaic floors are found in Roman villas across [[North Africa]], in places such as [[Carthage]], and can still be seen in the extensive collection in [[Bardo Museum]] in [[Tunis]], [[Tunisia]].

There were two main techniques in Greco-Roman mosaic: ''[[opus vermiculatum]]'' used tiny ''[[tesserae]]'', typically cubes of 4 millimeters or less, and was produced in workshops in relatively small panels which were transported to the site glued to some temporary support. The tiny ''tesserae'' allowed very fine detail, and an approach to the illusionism of painting.  Often small panels called ''emblemata'' were inserted into walls or as the highlights of larger floor-mosaics in coarser work.  The normal technique was ''[[opus tessellatum]]'', using larger tesserae, which was laid on site.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=116–119}}  There was a distinct native Italian style using black on a white background, which was no doubt cheaper than fully coloured work.{{sfn|Smith|1983|pp=121–123}}

In Rome, Nero and his architects used mosaics to cover some surfaces of walls and ceilings in the ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', built 64 AD, and wall mosaics are also found at [[Pompeii]] and neighbouring sites.  However it seems that it was not until the Christian era that figural wall mosaics became a major form of artistic expression. The Roman church of [[Santa Costanza]], which served as a [[mausoleum]] for one or more of the Imperial family, has both religious mosaic and decorative secular ceiling mosaics on a round vault, which probably represent the style of contemporary palace decoration.

The mosaics of the [[Villa Romana del Casale]] near [[Piazza Armerina]] in [[Sicily]] are the largest collection of late Roman mosaics ''in situ'' in the world, and are protected as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. The large ''villa rustica'', which was probably owned by Emperor [[Maximian]], was built largely in the early 4th century. The mosaics were covered and protected for 700 years by a landslide that occurred in the 12th Century. The most important pieces are the ''Circus Scene'', the 64m long ''Great Hunting Scene'', the ''Little Hunt'', the ''Labours of Hercules'' and the famous ''Bikini Girls'', showing women undertaking a range of sporting activities in garments that resemble 20th Century [[bikinis]]. The [[peristyle]], the imperial apartments and the [[thermae]] were also decorated with ornamental and [[mythological]] mosaics.&lt;ref name="UNESCO casale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/832 |title=Villa Romana del Casale |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other important examples of Roman mosaic art in Sicily were unearthed on the Piazza Vittoria in [[Palermo]] where two houses were discovered. The most important scenes there depicted are an [[Orpheus mosaic]], ''Alexander the Great's Hunt'' and the ''Four Seasons''.

In 1913 the [[Zliten mosaic]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] mosaic famous for its many scenes from gladiatorial contests, hunting and everyday life, was discovered in the [[Libyan]] town of [[Zliten]].  In 2000 archaeologists working in [[Leptis Magna]], [[Libya]], uncovered a 30&amp;nbsp;ft length of five colorful mosaics created during the 1st or 2nd century AD. The mosaics show a warrior in combat with a deer, four young men wrestling a wild bull to the ground, and a gladiator resting in a state of fatigue, staring at his slain opponent. The mosaics decorated the walls of a cold plunge pool in a bath house within a Roman villa. The gladiator mosaic is noted by scholars as one of the finest examples of mosaic art ever seen — a "masterpiece comparable in quality with the [[Alexander Mosaic]] in [[Pompeii]]."

A specific genre of Roman mosaic was called ''asaroton'' (Greek for "unswept floor").

===Christian mosaics===

====Early Christian art====
{{Main article|Late Antique and medieval mosaics in Italy}}
[[File:Mosaico di cristo in trono tra gli apostoli e le ss. prudenziana e prassede, 410 dc ca. 06.jpg|thumb|upright=1.8|Detail of a [[Paleochristian]] mosaic from the basilica of [[Santa Pudenziana]] in Rome, c. 410 AD, depicting Saint [[Pudentiana]]]]
With the building of Christian [[basilica]]s in the late 4th century, wall and ceiling mosaics were adopted for Christian uses. The earliest examples of Christian basilicas have not survived, but the mosaics of [[Santa Constanza]] and [[Santa Pudenziana]], both from the 4th century, still exist. The winemaking putti in the [[ambulatory]] of Santa Constanza still follow the classical tradition in that they represent the feast of [[Bacchus]], which symbolizes transformation or change, and are thus appropriate for a mausoleum, the original function of this building. In another great Constantinian basilica, the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]] the original mosaic floor with typical Roman geometric motifs is partially preserved. The so-called [[Tomb of the Julii]], near the crypt beneath [[St Peter's Basilica]], is a 4th-century vaulted tomb with wall and ceiling mosaics that are given Christian interpretations. The [[Arch of Galerius and Rotunda|Rotunda of Galerius]] in [[Thessaloniki]], converted into a Christian church during the course of the 4th century, was embellished with very high artistic quality mosaics. Only fragments survive of the original decoration, especially a band depicting saints with hands raised in prayer, in front of complex architectural fantasies.

In the following century [[Ravenna]], the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]], became the center of late Roman mosaic art (see details in Ravenna section). [[Milan]] also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the [[St Aquilinus]] Chapel of the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Milan|Basilica of San Lorenzo]], mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of [[Elijah]]; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]], which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later. The baptistery of the basilica, which was demolished in the 15th century, had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae, large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated. In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro, now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio, every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century. Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome, while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background. The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists.

[[Albenga|Albingaunum]] was the main Roman port of [[Liguria]]. The octagonal baptistery of the town was decorated in the 5th century with high quality blue and white mosaics representing the Apostles. The surviving remains are somewhat fragmented. [[Massilia]] remained a thriving port and a Christian spiritual center in Southern Gaul where favourable societal and economic conditions ensured the survival of mosaic art in the 5th and 6th centuries. The large baptistery, once the grandest building of its kind in Western Europe, had a geometric floor mosaic which is only known from 19th century descriptions. Other parts of the episcopal complex were also decorated with mosaics as new finds, that were unearthed in the 2000s, attest. The funerary [[Abbey of St. Victor, Marseille|basilica of Saint Victor]], built in a quarry outside the walls, was decorated with mosaics but only a small fragment with blue and green scrolls survived on the intrados of an arch (the basilica was later buried under a medieval abbey).

A mosaic pavement depicting humans, animals and plants from the original 4th-century cathedral of [[Aquileia]] has survived in the later medieval church. This mosaic adopts pagan motifs such as the Nilotic scene, but behind the traditional naturalistic content is Christian symbolism such as the [[ichthys]]. The 6th-century early Christian basilicas of Sant' Eufemia [[:it:Basilica di Sant'Eufemia (Grado)]]  and Santa Maria delle Grazie in [[Grado, Italy|Grado]] also have mosaic floors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Efthalia|last=Rentetzi |title=stylistic relationships between the mosaic flooring of s.

====Ravenna====
[[File:"The good Shepherd" mosaic - Mausoleum of Galla Placidia.jpg|thumb|[[The Good Shepherd (Christianity)|The Good Shepherd]] mosaic in the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]], [[Ravenna]]]]
[[File:Mosaic of Justinianus I - Basilica San Vitale (Ravenna).jpg|thumb|Mosaic of [[Justinianus I]] in [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]]]]
In the 5th-century [[Ravenna]], the capital of the [[Western Roman Empire]], became the center of late Roman mosaic art. The [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] was decorated with mosaics of high artistic quality in 425–430. The vaults of the small, cross-shaped structure are clad with mosaics on blue background. The central motif above the crossing is a golden cross in the middle of the starry sky. Another great building established by [[Galla Placidia]] was the church of [[San Giovanni Evangelista, Ravenna|San Giovanni Evangelista]]. She erected it in fulfillment of a vow that she made having escaped from a deadly storm in 425 on the sea voyage from Constantinople to Ravenna. The mosaics depicted the storm, portraits of members of the western and eastern imperial family and the bishop of Ravenna, [[Peter Chrysologus]]. They are known only from Renaissance sources because almost all were destroyed in 1747.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ravenna|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12662b.htm|work=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ostrogoths]] kept alive the tradition in the 6th century, as the mosaics of the [[Arian Baptistry]], [[Baptistry of Neon]], [[Archbishop's Chapel, Ravenna|Archbishop's Chapel]], and the earlier phase mosaics in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]] and [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo]] testify.

After 539 Ravenna was reconquered by the Romans in the form of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] (Byzantine Empire) and became the seat of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. The greatest development of Christian mosaics unfolded in the second half of the 6th century. Outstanding examples of Byzantine mosaic art are the later phase mosaics in the Basilica of San Vitale and Basilica of Sant'Apollinare Nuovo. The mosaic depicting Emperor Saint [[Justinian I]] and [[Theodora (6th century)|Empress Theodora]] in the Basilica of San Vitale were executed shortly after the Byzantine conquest. The mosaics of the [[Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe]] were made around 549. The anti-Arian theme is obvious in the apse mosaic of [[San Michele in Affricisco]], executed in 545–547 (largely destroyed; the remains in [[Berlin]]).

The last example of Byzantine mosaics in Ravenna was commissioned by bishop Reparatus between 673–79 in the Basilica of Sant'Apollinare in Classe. The mosaic panel in the apse showing the bishop with Emperor [[Constantine IV]] is obviously an imitation of the Justinian panel in San Vitale.

====Butrint====
The mosaic pavement of the Vrina Plain basilica of [[Butrint]], [[Albania]] appear to pre-date that of the Baptistery by almost a generation, dating to the last quarter of the 5th or the first years of the 6th century. The mosaic displays a variety of motifs including sea-creatures, birds, terrestrial beasts, fruits, flowers, trees and abstracts – designed to depict a terrestrial paradise of God’s creation. Superimposed on this scheme are two large tablets, tabulae ansatae, carrying inscriptions. A variety of fish, a crab, a lobster, shrimps, mushrooms, flowers, a stag and two cruciform designs surround the smaller of the two inscriptions, which reads: In fulfilment of the vow (prayer) of those whose names God knows. This anonymous dedicatory inscription is a public demonstration of the benefactors’ humility and an acknowledgement of God’s omniscience.

The abundant variety of natural life depicted in the Butrint mosaics celebrates the richness of God’s creation; some elements also have specific connotations. The [[kantharos]] vase and vine refer to the [[eucharist]], the symbol of the sacrifice of Christ leading to salvation. Peacocks are symbols of paradise and resurrection; shown eating or drinking from the vase they indicate the route to eternal life. Deer or stags were commonly used as images of the faithful aspiring to Christ: "As a heart desireth the water brook, so my souls longs for thee, O God." Water-birds and fish and other sea-creatures can indicate baptism as well as the members of the Church who are christened.

====Late Antique and Early Medieval Rome====

[[File:RomaSantaMariaMaggioreArcoTrionfaleDxRegistro4.jpg|thumb|5th century mosaic in the triumphal arch of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], Rome]]

Christian mosaic art also flourished in Rome, gradually declining as conditions became more difficult in the [[Early Middle Ages]]. 5th century mosaics can be found over the triumphal arch and in the nave of the basilica of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. The 27 surviving panels of the nave are the most important mosaic cycle in Rome of this period. Two other important 5th century mosaics are lost but we know them from 17th-century drawings. In the apse mosaic of [[Sant'Agata dei Goti]] (462–472, destroyed in 1589) Christ was seated on a globe with the twelve Apostles flanking him, six on either side. At [[Sant'Andrea in Catabarbara]] (468–483, destroyed in 1686) Christ appeared in the center, flanked on either side by three Apostles. Four streams flowed from the little mountain supporting Christ. The original 5th-century apse mosaic of the [[Santa Sabina]] was replaced by a very similar fresco by [[Taddeo Zuccari]] in 1559. The composition probably remained unchanged: Christ flanked by male and female saints, seated on a hill while lambs drinking from a stream at its feet. All three mosaics had a similar iconography.

6th-century pieces are rare in Rome but the mosaics inside the triumphal arch of the basilica of [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] belong to this era. The ''Chapel of Ss. Primo e Feliciano'' in [[Santo Stefano Rotondo]] has very interesting and rare mosaics from the 7th century. This chapel was built by [[Pope Theodore I]] as a family burial place.

In the 7th–9th centuries Rome fell under the influence of Byzantine art, noticeable on the mosaics of [[Santa Prassede]], [[Santa Maria in Domnica]], [[Sant'Agnese fuori le Mura]], [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], [[Santi Nereo e Achilleo]] and the San Venanzio chapel of [[San Giovanni in Laterano]]. The great dining hall of [[Pope Leo III]] in the [[Lateran Palace]] was also decorated with mosaics. They were all destroyed later except for one example, the so-called [[Triclinio Leoniano]] of which a copy was made in the 18th century. Another great work of Pope Leo, the apse mosaic of [[Santa Susanna]], depicted Christ with the Pope and [[Charlemagne]] on one side, and SS. Susanna and Felicity on the other. It was plastered over during a renovation in 1585. Pope [[Paschal I]] (817–824) embellished the church of [[Santo Stefano del Cacco]] with an apsidal mosaic which depicted the pope with a model of the church (destroyed in 1607).

The fragment of an 8th-century mosaic, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]] is one of the very rare remaining pieces of the medieval decoration of [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]], demolished in the late 16th century. The precious fragment is kept in the sacristy of [[Santa Maria in Cosmedin]]. It proves the high artistic quality of the destroyed St. Peter's mosaics.

====Byzantine mosaics====

Mosaics were more central to Byzantine culture than to that of Western Europe. Byzantine church interiors were generally covered with golden mosaics. Mosaic art flourished in the [[Byzantine Empire]] from the 6th to the 15th centuries. The majority of Byzantine mosaics were destroyed without trace during wars and conquests, but the surviving remains still form a fine collection.{{sfn|Lowden|1997|pp=whole book}}

The great buildings of [[Justinian I|Emperor Justinian]] like the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], the [[Nea Ekklesia of the Theotokos|Nea Church]] in [[Jerusalem]] and the rebuilt [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]] were certainly embellished with mosaics but none of these survived.

Important fragments survived from the mosaic floor of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] which was commissioned during [[Justinian]]'s reign. The figures, animals, plants all are entirely classical but they are scattered before a plain background. The portrait of a moustached man, probably a Gothic chieftain, is considered the most important surviving mosaic of the Justinianian age. The so-called ''small sekreton'' of the palace was built during [[Justin II]]'s reign around 565–577. Some fragments survive from the mosaics of this vaulted room. The vine scroll motifs are very similar to those in the Santa Constanza and they still closely follow the Classical tradition. There are remains of floral decoration in the [[Church of the Acheiropoietos]] in [[Thessaloniki]] (5th–6th centuries).

[[File:St George as patron of two children. Mosaic, church of St Demetrios in Thessaloniki.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A pre-[[Iconoclastic]] depiction of St. Demetrios at the Hagios Demetrios Basilica in Thessaloniki.]]
In the 6th century, [[Ravenna]], the capital of Byzantine Italy, became the center of mosaic making. [[Istria]] also boasts some important examples from this era. The [[Euphrasian Basilica]] in [[Poreč|Parentium]] was built in the middle of the 6th century and decorated with mosaics depicting the [[Theotokos]] flanked by angels and saints.

Fragments remain from the mosaics of the [[Church of Santa Maria Formosa]] in [[Pula|Pola]]. These pieces were made during the 6th century by artists from Constantinople. Their pure Byzantine style is different from the contemporary Ravennate mosaics.

Very few early Byzantine mosaics survived the [[Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic]] destruction of the 8th century. Among the rare examples are the 6th-century ''Christ in majesty'' (or ''Ezekiel's Vision'') mosaic in the apse of the [[Church of Hosios David]] in [[Thessaloniki]] that was hidden behind mortar during those dangerous times. Nine mosaic panels in the [[Hagios Demetrios|Hagios Demetrios Church]], which were made between 634 and 730, also escaped destruction. Unusually almost all represent [[Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki]], often with suppliants before him.

In the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|Iconoclastic era]], figural mosaics were also condemned as idolatry. The Iconoclastic churches were embellished with plain gold mosaics with only one great cross in the apse like the [[Hagia Irene]] in Constantinople (after 740). There were similar crosses in the apses of the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia Church]] in Thessaloniki and in the [[Church of the Dormition, Nicaea|Church of the Dormition]] in [[Iznik|Nicaea]]. The crosses were substituted with the image of the [[Theotokos]] in both churches after the victory of the [[Iconodules]] (787–797 and in 8th–9th centuries respectively,  the Dormition church was totally destroyed in 1922).

A similar Theotokos image flanked by two archangels were made for the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople in 867. The dedication inscription says: "The images which the impostors had cast down here pious emperors have again set up." In the 870s the so-called ''large sekreton'' of the [[Great Palace of Constantinople]] was decorated with the images of the four great iconodule patriarchs.

The post-Iconoclastic era was the heyday of Byzantine art with the most beautiful mosaics executed. The mosaics of the [[Macedonian Renaissance]] (867–1056) carefully mingled traditionalism with innovation. Constantinopolitan mosaics of this age followed the decoration scheme first used in Emperor [[Basil I]]'s [[Nea Ekklesia]]. Not only this prototype was later totally destroyed but each surviving composition is battered so it is necessary to move from church to church to reconstruct the system.

An interesting set of Macedonian-era mosaics make up the decoration of the [[Hosios Loukas]] Monastery. In the narthex there is the Crucifixion, the Pantokrator and the Anastasis above the doors, while in the church the Theotokos (apse), Pentecost, scenes from Christ's life and ermit St Loukas (all executed before 1048). The scenes are treated with a minimum of detail and the panels are dominated with the gold setting.
[[File:Meister der Nea-Moni-Kirche in Chios 002.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Detail of mosaic from [[Nea Moni]] Monastery]]
The [[Nea Moni]] Monastery on [[Chios]] was established by [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]] in 1043–1056. The exceptional mosaic decoration of the dome showing probably the nine orders of the angels was destroyed in 1822 but other panels survived (Theotokos with raised hands, four evangelists with seraphim, scenes from Christ's life and an interesting Anastasis where King Salomon bears resemblance to Constantine Monomachos). In comparison with Osios Loukas Nea Moni mosaics contain more figures, detail, landscape and setting.

Another great undertaking by Constantine Monomachos was the restoration of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] between 1042 and 1048. Nothing survived of the mosaics which covered the walls and the dome of the edifice but the Russian abbot Daniel, who visited Jerusalem in 1106–1107 left a description: "Lively mosaics of the holy prophets are under the ceiling, over the tribune. The altar is surmounted by a mosaic image of Christ. In the main altar one can see the mosaic of the Exaltation of Adam. In the apse the Ascension of Christ. The Annunciation occupies the two pillars next to the altar."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.com/www1/jhs/TSspdest.html The Holy Sepulchre – The great destruction of 1009&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Daphni Monastery]] houses the best preserved complex of mosaics from the early Comnenan period (ca. 1100) when the austere and hieratic manner typical for the [[Macedonian dynasty|Macedonian epoch]] and represented by the awesome [[Christ Pantocrator]] image inside the dome, was metamorphosing into a more intimate and delicate style, of which ''The Angel before St Joachim'' — with its pastoral backdrop, harmonious gestures and pensive lyricism — is considered a superb example.

The 9th- and 10th-century mosaics of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in Constantinople are truly classical Byzantine artworks. The north and south tympana beneath the dome was decorated with figures of prophets, saints and patriarchs. Above the principal door from the narthex we can see an ''Emperor kneeling before Christ'' (late 9th or early 10th century). Above the door from the southwest vestibule to the narthex another mosaic shows the ''Theotokos with Justinian and Constantine''. [[Justinian I]] is offering the model of the church to Mary while [[Constantine I|Constantine]] is holding a model of the city in his hand. Both emperors are beardless – this is an example for conscious archaization as contemporary Byzantine rulers were bearded. A mosaic panel on the gallery shows ''Christ with [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]] and [[Zoe (empress)|Empress Zoe]]'' (1042–1055). The emperor gives a bulging [[money sack]] to Christ as a donation for the church.

The dome of the [[Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki)|Hagia Sophia Church]] in Thessaloniki is decorated with an ''Ascension'' mosaic (c. 885). The composition resembles the great baptistries in [[Ravenna]], with apostles standing between palms and Christ in the middle. The scheme is somewhat unusual as the standard post-Iconoclastic formula for domes contained only the image of the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]].

[[File:Christ Pantocrator mosaic from Hagia Sophia 2240 x 3109 pixels 2.5 MB.jpg|thumb|upright|Mosaic of [[Christ Pantocrator]] from [[Hagia Sophia]] from the ''Deesis'' mosaic.]]
[[File:Santa Sofia - Mosaic de Joan II Comnè i la seva esposa, Irene.JPG|thumb|A mosaic from the [[Hagia Sophia]] of [[Constantinople]] (modern Istanbul), depicting [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] and [[Jesus]], flanked by [[John II Komnenos]] (left) and his wife [[Irene of Hungary]] (right), c. 1118 AD]]
There are very few existing mosaics from the [[Komnenos|Komnenian period]] but this paucity must be due to accidents of survival and gives a misleading impression. The only surviving 12th-century mosaic work in [[Constantinople]] is a panel in Hagia Sophia depicting Emperor [[John II Komnenos|John II]] and Empress [[Piroska of Hungary|Eirene]] with the [[Theotokos]] (1122–34). The empress with her long braided hair and rosy cheeks is especially capturing. It must be a lifelike portrayal because Eirene was really a redhead as her original Hungarian name, ''Piroska'' shows. The adjacent portrait of Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] on a pier (from 1122) is similarly personal. The imperial mausoleum of the [[Komnenos]] dynasty, the [[Zeyrek Camii|Pantokrator Monastery]] was certainly decorated with great mosaics but these were later destroyed. The lack of Komnenian mosaics outside the capital is even more apparent. There is only a "Communion of the Apostles" in the apse of the cathedral of [[Serres, Greece|Serres]].

A striking technical innovation of the Komnenian period was the production of very precious, miniature mosaic icons. In these icons the small tesserae (with sides of 1&amp;nbsp;mm or less) were set on wax or resin on a wooden panel. These products of extraordinary craftmanship were intended for private devotion. The [[Louvre Transfiguration]] is a very fine example from the late 12th century. The miniature mosaic of Christ in the Museo Nazionale at [[Florence]] illustrates the more gentle, humanistic conception of Christ which appeared in the 12th century.

The sack of Constantinople in 1204 caused the decline of mosaic art for the next five decades. After the reconquest of the city by [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1261 the Hagia Sophia was restored and a beautiful new ''[[Deesis]]'' was made on the south gallery. This huge mosaic panel with figures two and a half times lifesize is really overwhelming due to its grand scale and superlative craftsmanship. The Hagia Sophia ''Deesis'' is probably the most famous Byzantine mosaic in Constantinople.

The [[Pammakaristos Church|Pammakaristos Monastery]] was restored by [[Michael Doukas Glabas Tarchaneiotes|Michael Glabas]], an imperial official, in the late 13th century. Only the mosaic decoration of the small burial chapel ([[parekklesion]]) of Glabas survived. This domed chapel was built by his widow, Martha around 1304–08. In the miniature dome the traditional Pantokrator can be seen with twelve prophets beneath. Unusually the apse is decorated with a ''[[Deesis]]'', probably due to the funerary function of the chapel.

The [[Church of the Holy Apostles (Thessaloniki)|Church of the Holy Apostles]] in [[Thessaloniki]] was built in 1310–14. Although some vandal systematically removed the gold tesserae of the background it can be seen that the Pantokrator and the prophets in the dome follow the traditional Byzantine pattern. Many details are similar to the Pammakaristos mosaics so it is supposed that the same team of mosaicists worked in both buildings. Another building with a related mosaic decoration is the [[Theotokos Paregoritissa Church]] in [[Arta, Greece|Arta]]. The church was established by the Despot of [[Epirus]] in 1294–96. In the dome is the traditional stern Pantokrator, with prophets and cherubim below.

[[File:Chora Church interior March 2008.JPG|thumb|left|Mosaic of Theodore Metochites offering the Chora Church to Christ]]
The greatest mosaic work of the [[Palaeologan renaissance in art]] is the decoration of the [[Chora Church]] in Constantinople. Although the mosaics of the naos have not survived except three panels, the decoration of the exonarthex and the esonarthex constitute the most important full-scale mosaic cycle in Constantinople after the Hagia Sophia. They were executed around 1320 by the command of [[Theodore Metochites]]. The esonarthex has two fluted domes, specially created to provide the ideal setting for the mosaic images of the ancestors of Christ. The southern one is called the Dome of the Pantokrator while the northern one is the Dome of the Theotokos. The most important panel of the esonarthex depicts Theodore Metochites wearing a huge [[turban]], offering the model of the church to Christ. The walls of both narthexes are decorated with mosaic cycles from the life of the Virgin and the life of Christ. These panels show the influence of the Italian [[trecento]] on Byzantine art especially the more natural settings, landscapes, figures.

The last Byzantine mosaic work was created for the Hagia Sophia, Constantinople in the middle of the 14th century. The great eastern arch of the cathedral collapsed in 1346, bringing down the third of the main dome. By 1355 not only the big Pantokrator image was restored but new mosaics were set on the eastern arch depicting the Theotokos, the Baptist and Emperor [[John V Palaiologos]] (discovered only in 1989).

In addition to the large-scale monuments several miniature mosaic icons of outstanding quality was produced for the Palaiologos court and nobles. The loveliest examples from the 14th century are ''Annunciation'' in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] and a mosaic diptych in the Cathedral Treasury of [[Florence]] representing the ''Twelve Feasts of the Church''.

In the troubled years of the 15th century the fatally weakened empire could not afford luxurious mosaics. Churches were decorated with wall-paintings in this era and after the [[Fall of Constantinople|Turkish conquest]].

====Rome in the High Middle Ages====
[[File:Apse mosaic SM Maggiore.jpg|thumb|Apse mosaic in the [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]]]
The last great period of Roman mosaic art was the 12th–13th century when [[Rome]] developed its own distinctive artistic style, free from the strict rules of eastern tradition and with a more realistic portrayal of figures in the space. Well-known works of this period are the floral mosaics of the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], the façade of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]] and [[San Paolo fuori le Mura]]. The beautiful apse mosaic of Santa Maria in Trastevere (1140) depicts Christ and Mary sitting next to each other on the heavenly throne, the first example of this iconographic scheme. A similar mosaic, the [[Coronation of the Virgin]], decorates the apse of [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]. It is a work of [[Jacopo Torriti]] from 1295. The mosaics of Torriti and [[Jacopo da Camerino]] in the apse of [[San Giovanni in Laterano]] from 1288–94 were thoroughly restored in 1884. The apse mosaic of [[San Crisogono]] is attributed to [[Pietro Cavallini]], the greatest Roman painter of the 13th century. Six scenes from the life of Mary in Santa Maria in Trastevere were also executed by Cavallini in 1290. These mosaics are praised for their realistic portrayal and attempts at perspective. There is an interesting mosaic medaillon from 1210 above the gate of the church of [[San Tommaso in Formis]] showing Christ enthroned between a white and a black slave. The church belonged to the Order of the [[Trinitarians]] which was devoted to ransoming Christian slaves.

The great [[Navicella (mosaic)|''Navicella'' mosaic]] (1305–1313) in the atrium of the Old St. Peter's is attributed to [[Giotto di Bondone]]. The giant mosaic, commissioned by Cardinal [[Jacopo Stefaneschi]], was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard. It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters. This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter's in the 17th century. Navicella means "little ship" referring to the large boat which dominated the scene, and whose sail, filled by the storm, loomed over the horizon. Such a natural representation of a seascape was known only from ancient works of art.

====Sicily====
[[File:Chapelle Palatine.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arabic]] arches and Byzantine mosaics in the [[Cappella Palatina]] of [[Roger II of Sicily]]]]

The heyday of mosaic making in [[Sicily]] was the age of the independent [[Normans|Norman]] kingdom in the 12th century. The Norman kings adopted the Byzantine tradition of mosaic decoration to enhance the somewhat dubious legality of their rule. Greek masters working in Sicily developed their own style, that shows the influence of Western European and Islamic artistic tendencies. Best examples of Sicilian mosaic art are the [[Cappella Palatina]] of [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger II]],&lt;ref&gt;''Some Palatine Aspects of the Cappella Palatina in Palermo'', Slobodan Ćurčić, '''Dumbarton Oaks Papers''', Vol. 41, 139.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Martorana]] church in [[Palermo]] and the cathedrals of [[cathedral of Cefalù|Cefalù]] and [[Monreale]].

The Cappella Palatina clearly shows evidence for blending the eastern and western styles. The dome (1142–42) and the eastern end of the church (1143–1154) were decorated with typical Byzantine mosaics i.e. Pantokrator, angels, scenes from the life of Christ. Even the inscriptions are written in Greek. The narrative scenes of the nave (Old Testament, life of Sts Peter and Paul) are resembling to the mosaics of the Old St. Peter's and St. Paul's Basilica in [[Rome]] (Latin inscriptions, 1154–66).

The Martorana church (decorated around 1143) looked originally even more Byzantine although important parts were later demolished. The dome mosaic is similar to that of the Cappella Palatina, with Christ enthroned in the middle and four bowed, elongated angels. The Greek inscriptions, decorative patterns, and evangelists in the [[squinches]] are obviously executed by the same Greek masters who worked on the Cappella Palatina. The mosaic depicting Roger II of Sicily, dressed in Byzantine imperial robes and receiving the crown by Christ, was originally in the demolished [[narthex]] together with another panel, the [[Theotokos]] with Georgios of Antiochia, the founder of the church.

In [[Cefalù]] (1148) only the high, French Gothic presbytery was covered with mosaics: the [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]] on the semidome of the apse and [[cherubim]] on the vault. On the walls are Latin and Greek saints, with Greek inscriptions.

[[File:Dedication mosaic - Cathedral of Monreale - Italy 2015 (crop).JPG|thumb|upright|[[Monreale]] mosaics: William II offering the [[Monreale Cathedral]] to the [[Virgin Mary]]]]
The [[Monreale]] mosaics constitute the largest decoration of this kind in Italy, covering 0,75 hectares with at least 100 million glass and stone tesserae. This huge work was executed between 1176 and 1186 by the order of King [[William II of Sicily]]. The iconography of the mosaics in the presbytery is similar to Cefalu while the pictures in the nave are almost the same as the narrative scenes in the Cappella Palatina. The Martorana mosaic of Roger II blessed by Christ was repeated with the figure of King William II instead of his predecessor. Another panel shows the king offering the model of the cathedral to the Theotokos.

The [[Cathedral of Palermo]], rebuilt by Archbishop Walter in the same time (1172–85), was also decorated with mosaics but none of these survived except the 12th-century image of ''Madonna del Tocco'' above the western portal.

The cathedral of [[Messina]], consecrated in 1197, was also decorated with a great mosaic cycle, originally on par with Cefalù and Monreale, but heavily damaged and restored many times later. In the left apse of the same cathedral 14th-century mosaics survived, representing the Madonna and Child between Saints Agata and Lucy, the Archangels Gabriel and Michael and Queens Eleonora and Elisabetta.

Southern Italy was also part of the Norman kingdom but great mosaics did not survive in this area except the fine mosaic pavement of the [[Otranto Cathedral]] from 1166, with mosaics tied into a tree of life, mostly still preserved. The scenes depict biblical characters, warrior kings, medieval beasts, allegories of the months and working activity. Only fragments survived from the original mosaic decoration of [[Amalfi]]'s Norman Cathedral. The mosaic ambos in the churches of [[Ravello]] prove that mosaic art was widespread in Southern Italy during the 11th–13th centuries.

The palaces of the Norman kings were decorated with mosaics depicting animals and landscapes. The secular mosaics are seemingly more Eastern in character than the great religious cycles and show a strong Persian influence. The most notable examples are the ''Sala di Ruggero'' in the [[Palazzo dei Normanni]], [[Palermo]] and the ''Sala della Fontana'' in the [[Zisa, Palermo|Zisa]] summer palace, both from the 12th century.

====Venice====

In parts of [[Italy]], which were under eastern artistic influences, like [[Sicily]] and [[Venice]], mosaic making never went out of fashion in the Middle Ages. The whole interior of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice is clad with elaborate, golden mosaics. The oldest scenes were executed by Greek masters in the late 11th century but the majority of the mosaics are works of local artists from the 12th–13th centuries. The decoration of the church was finished only in the 16th century. One hundred and ten scenes of mosaics in the atrium of St Mark's were based directly on the miniatures of the [[Cotton Genesis]], a Byzantine manuscript that was brought to Venice after the sack of Constantinople (1204). The mosaics were executed in the 1220s.

Other important Venetian mosaics can be found in the [[Torcello Cathedral|Cathedral of Santa Maria Assunta]] in [[Torcello]] from the 12th century, and in the Basilical of Santi Maria e Donato in [[Murano]] with a restored apse mosaic from the 12th century and a beautiful mosaic pavement (1140). The apse of the San Cipriano Church in Murano was decorated with an impressive golden mosaic from the early 13th century showing Christ enthroned with Mary, St John and the two patron saints, Cipriano and Cipriana. When the church was demolished in the 19th century, the mosaic was bought by [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]]. It was reassembled in the [[Church of Peace (Sanssouci)|Friedenskirche]] of [[Potsdam]] in the 1840s.

[[Trieste]] was also an important center of mosaic art. The mosaics in the apse of the [[Cathedral of San Giusto, Trieste|Cathedral of San Giusto]] were laid by master craftsmen from [[Veneto]] in the 12th–13th centuries.

====Medieval Italy====
The monastery of [[Grottaferrata]] founded by Greek [[Basilian monks]] and consecrated by the Pope in 1024 was decorated with Italo-Byzantine mosaics, some of which survived in the narthex and the interior. The mosaics on the triumphal arch portray the Twelve Apostles sitting beside an empty throne, evoking Christ's ascent to Heaven. It is a Byzantine work of the 12th century. There is a beautiful 11th-century Deesis above the main portal.

The Abbot of [[Monte Cassino]], [[Pope Victor III|Desiderius]] sent envoys to [[Constantinople]] some time after 1066 to hire expert Byzantine mosaicists for the decoration of the rebuilt abbey church. According to chronicler [[Leo of Ostia]] the Greek artists decorated the apse, the arch and the vestibule of the basilica. Their work was admired by contemporaries but was totally destroyed in later centuries except two fragments depicting greyhounds (now in the Monte Cassino Museum). "The abbot in his wisdom decided that great number of young monks in the monastery should be thoroughly initiated in these arts" – says the chronicler about the role of the Greeks in the revival of mosaic art in medieval Italy.

[[File:Florenca133b.jpg|thumb|[[Florence Baptistry]]]]
In [[Florence]] a magnificiant mosaic of the [[Last Judgement]] decorates the dome of the [[Florence Baptistery|Baptistery]]. The earliest mosaics, works of art of many unknown Venetian craftsmen (including probably [[Cimabue]]), date from 1225. The covering of the ceiling was probably not completed until the 14th century.

The impressive mosaic of Christ in Majesty, flanked by the Blessed Virgin and St. John the Evangelist in the apse of the [[Piazza dei Miracoli|cathedral of Pisa]] was designed by [[Cimabue]] in 1302. It evokes the Monreale mosaics in style. It survived the great fire of 1595 which destroyed most of the mediveval interior decoration.

Sometimes not only church interiors but façades were also decorated with mosaics in Italy like in the case of the [[St Mark's Basilica]] in Venice (mainly from the 17th–19th centuries, but the oldest one from 1270–75, "The burial of St Mark in the first basilica"), the [[Duomo di Orvieto|Cathedral of Orvieto]] (golden Gothic mosaics from the 14th century, many times redone) and the [[Basilica di San Frediano]] in [[Lucca]] (huge, striking golden mosaic representing the Ascension of Christ with the apostles below, designed by [[Berlinghiero Berlinghieri]] in the 13th century). The [[Cathedral of Spoleto]] is also decorated on the upper façade with a huge mosaic portraying the ''Blessing Christ'' (signed by one Solsternus from 1207).

====Western and Central Europe====
[[File:st.peters.basilica.tesserae.arp.jpg|thumb|left|A “painting” made from tesserae in [[St Peter's Basilica]], [[Vatican State]], Italy]]

Beyond the [[Alps]] the first important example of mosaic art was the decoration of the [[Palatine Chapel in Aachen]], commissioned by [[Charlemagne]]. It was completely destroyed in a fire in 1650. A rare example of surviving Carolingian mosaics is the [[apse]] [[semi-dome]] decoration of the oratory of [[Germigny-des-Prés]] built in 805–806 by [[Theodulf]], [[bishop of Orléans]], a leading figure of the [[Carolingian renaissance]]. This unique work of art, rediscovered only in the 19th century, had no followers.

Only scant remains prove that mosaics were still used in the Early Middle Ages. The Abbey of Saint-Martial in [[Limoges]], originally an important place of pilgrimage, was totally demolished during the [[French Revolution]] except its crypt which was rediscovered in the 1960s. A mosaic panel was unearthed which was dated to the 9th century. It somewhat incongruously uses cubes of gilded glass and deep green marble, probably taken from antique pavements. This could also be the case with the early 9th century mosaic found under the [[Basilica of Saint-Quentin]] in [[Picardy]], where antique motifs are copied but using only simple colors. The mosaics in the Cathedral of Saint-Jean at [[Lyon]] have been dated to the 11th century because they employ the same non-antique simple colors. More fragments were found on the site of Saint-Croix at [[Poitiers]] which might be from the 6th or 9th century.

[[File:st.peters.basilica.tesserae.closeup.arp.jpg|thumb|left|Close up of the bottom left corner of the picture above. Click the picture to see the individual [[tessera]]e]]

Later fresco replaced the more labor-intensive technique of mosaic in Western-Europe, although mosaics were sometimes used as decoration on medieval cathedrals. The Royal Basilica of the Hungarian kings in [[Székesfehérvár]] (Alba Regia) had a mosaic decoration in the apse. It was probably a work of Venetian or Ravennese craftsmen, executed in the first decades of the 11th century. The mosaic was almost totally destroyed together with the basilica in the 17th century. The Golden Gate of the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in [[Prague]] got its name from the golden 14th-century mosaic of the [[Last Judgement]] above the portal. It was executed by Venetian craftsmen.

[[File:Germigny Jplm.jpg|thumb|right|Carolingian mosaic in [[Germigny-des-Prés]]]]
The [[Crusaders]] in the [[Holy Land]] also adopted mosaic decoration under local Byzantine influence. During their 12th-century reconstruction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] in [[Jerusalem]] they complemented the existing Byzantine mosaics with new ones. Almost nothing of them survived except the "Ascension of Christ" in the Latin Chapel (now confusingly surrounded by many 20th-century mosaics). More substantial fragments were preserved from the 12th-century mosaic decoration of the [[Church of the Nativity]] in [[Bethlehem]]. The mosaics in the nave are arranged in five horizontal bands with the figures of the ancestors of Christ, Councils of the Church and angels. In the apses the Annunciation, the Nativity, Adoration of the Magi and Dormition of the Blessed Virgin can be seen. The program of redecoration of the church was completed in 1169 as a unique collaboration of the Byzantine emperor, the [[king of Jerusalem]] and the Latin Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Art and Colonialism: The mosaics of the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem (1169) and the problem of the ''crusader'' art |author=Lucy-Anne Hunt |date= |work= |publisher=  |jstor=1291693 |pages=69–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the remains of a mosaic pavement were discovered under the ruins of the [[Frumuşeni Mosaics|Bizere Monastery]] near the River [[Mureș River|Mureş]] in present-day [[Romania]]. The panels depict real or fantastic animal, floral, solar and geometric representations. Some archeologists supposed that it was the floor of an Orthodox church, built some time between the 10th and 11th century. Other experts claim that it was part of the later Catholic monastery on the site because it shows the signs of strong Italianate influence. The monastery was situated that time in the territory of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].

====Renaissance and Baroque====
Although mosaics went out of fashion and were substituted by frescoes, some of the great Renaissance artists also worked with the old technique. [[Raphael]]'s [[Creation of the World (Raphael)|Creation of the World]] in the dome of the [[Chigi Chapel]] in [[Santa Maria del Popolo]] is a notable example that was executed by a Venetian craftsman, Luigi di Pace.

During the papacy of [[Clement VIII]] (1592–1605), the “Congregazione della Reverenda Fabbrica di San Pietro" was established, providing an independent organisation charged with completing the decorations in the newly built [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. Instead of frescoes the cavernous Basilica was mainly decorated with mosaics. Among the explanations are:
# The old St. Peter's Basilica had been decorated with mosaic, as was common in churches built during the early Christian era; the 17th century followed the tradition to enhance continuity.
# In a church like this with high walls and few windows, mosaics were brighter and reflected more light.
# Mosaics had greater intrinsic longevity than either frescoes or canvases.
# Mosaics had an association with bejeweled decoration, flaunting richness.

The mosaics of St. Peter's often show lively [[Baroque]] compositions based on designs or canvases from like [[Ciro Ferri]], [[Guido Reni]], [[Domenichino]], [[Carlo Maratta]], and many others. [[Raphael]] is represented by a mosaic replica of this last painting, the [[Transfiguration (Raphael)|Transfiguration]]. Many different artists contributed to the 17th- and 18th-century mosaics in St. Peter's, including [[Giovanni Battista Calandra]], [[Fabio Cristofari]] (died 1689), and [[Pietro Paolo Cristofari]] (died 1743).&lt;ref&gt;DiFederico, F. R. (1983), ''The mosaics of Saint Peter's Decorating the New Basilica'', University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Works of the Fabbrica were often used as papal gifts.

====The Christian East====
{{Main article|Early Byzantine mosaics in the Middle East}}

[[File:Madaba map.jpg|thumb|[[Jerusalem]] on the [[Madaba Map]]]]
The eastern provinces of the [[Eastern Roman Empire|Eastern Roman]] and later the [[Byzantine Empire]]s inherited a strong artistic tradition from the [[Late Antiquity]]. Similarly to [[Italy]] and [[Constantinople]] churches and important secular buildings in the [[region of Syria]] and [[Egypt]] were decorated with elaborate mosaic panels between the 5th and 8th centuries. The great majority of these works of art were later destroyed but archeological excavations unearthed many surviving examples.

The single most important piece of Byzantine Christian mosaic art in the East is the [[Madaba Map]], made between 542 and 570 as the floor of the church of Saint George at [[Madaba]], [[Jordan]]. It was rediscovered in 1894. The Madaba Map is the oldest surviving cartographic depiction of the [[Holy Land]]. It depicts an area from [[Lebanon]] in the north to the [[Nile Delta]] in the south, and from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] in the west to the [[Arabian Desert|Eastern Desert]]. The largest and most detailed element of the topographic depiction is [[Jerusalem]], at the center of the map. The map is enriched with many naturalistic features, like animals, fishing boats, bridges and palm trees

One of the earliest examples of [[Dionysus mosaic, Samatya|Byzantine mosaic art]] in the region can be found on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]], an important place of pilgrimage in the Byzantine era where [[Moses]] died. Among the many 6th-century mosaics in the church complex (discovered after 1933) the most interesting one is located in the baptistery. The intact floor mosaic covers an area of 9 x 3 m and was laid down in 530. It depicts hunting and pastoral scenes with rich Middle Eastern flora and fauna.
[[File:Nebo05(js).jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic floor from the church on [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]] (baptistery, 530)]]
The Church of Sts. Lot and Procopius was founded in 567 in Nebo village under Mount Nebo (now [[Khirbet Mukhayyat]]). Its floor mosaic depicts everyday activities like grape harvest. Another two spectacular mosaics were discovered in the ruined Church of Preacher John nearby. One of the mosaics was placed above the other one which was completely covered and unknown until the modern restoration. The figures on the older mosaic have thus escaped the iconoclasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jordanjubilee.com/visitjor/sites2.htm|title=Khirbet al Mukhayat|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512160152/http://www.jordanjubilee.com/visitjor/sites2.htm|archivedate=12 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of [[Madaba]] remained an important center of mosaic making during the 5th–8th centuries. In the Church of the Apostles the middle of the main panel Thalassa, goddess of the sea, can be seen surrounded by fishes and other sea creatures. Native Middle Eastern birds, mammals, plants and fruits were also added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordanjubilee.com/history/mosaics.htm The mosaics of Jordan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161103213852/http://www.jordanjubilee.com/history/mosaics.htm |date=3 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saint Catherine's Transfiguration.jpg|thumb|The Transfiguration of Jesus in the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]]]]
Important Justinian era mosaics decorated the [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]] on [[Mount Sinai]] in [[Egypt]]. Generally wall mosaics have not survived in the region because of the destruction of buildings but the St. Catherine's Monastery is exceptional. On the upper wall [[Moses]] is shown in two panels on a landscape background. In the apse we can see the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] on a golden background. The apse is surrounded with bands containing medallions of apostles and prophets, and two contemporary figure, "Abbot Longinos" and "John the Deacon". The mosaic was probably created in 565/6.

[[Jerusalem]] with its many holy places probably had the highest concentration of mosaic-covered churches but very few of them survived the subsequent waves of destructions. The present remains do not do justice to the original richness of the city. The most important is the so-called "Armenian Mosaic" which was discovered in 1894 on the [[Street of the Prophets]] near [[Damascus Gate]]. It depicts a vine with many branches and grape clusters, which springs from a vase. Populating the vine's branches are peacocks, ducks, storks, pigeons, an eagle, a partridge, and a parrot in a cage. The inscription reads: "For the memory and salvation of all those Armenians whose name the Lord knows." Beneath a corner of the mosaic is a small, natural cave which contained human bones dating to the 5th or 6th centuries. The symbolism of the mosaic and the presence of the burial cave indicates that the room was used as a [[mortuary]] chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/israel/jerusalem-armenian-mosaic.htm |title=Armenian Mosaic, Jerusalem |year=2010 |accessdate=30 June 2010 |publisher=Sacred-destinations.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An exceptionally well preserved, carpet-like mosaic floor was uncovered in 1949 in [[al-Eizariya|Bethany]], the early Byzantine church of the [[Tomb of Lazarus (al-Eizariya)|Lazarium]] which was built between 333 and 390. Because of its purely geometrical pattern, the church floor is to be grouped with other mosaics of the time in Palestine and neighboring areas, especially the Constantinian mosaics in the central nave at Bethlehem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/san/BET04byz.html Bethany in Byzantine times I&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A second church was built above the older one during the 6th century with another more simple geometric mosaic floor.

[[File:Masada Byzantine Church floor mosaic by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|left|Detail from the mosaic floor of the Byzantine church of in [[Masada]]. The monastic community lived here in the 5th–7th centuries.]]
The [[monastic]] communities of the [[Judean Desert]] also decorated their monasteries with mosaic floors. The [[Monastery of Martyrius]] was founded in the end of the 5th century and it was re-discovered in 1982–85. The most important work of art here is the intact geometric mosaic floor of the refectory although the severely damaged church floor was similarly rich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/History/Early%20History%20-%20Archaeology/The%20Monastery%20of%20Martyrius The Monastery of Martyrius&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The mosaics in the church of the nearby [[Monastery of Euthymius]] are of later date (discovered in 1930). They were laid down in the Umayyad era, after a devastating earthquake in 659. Two six pointed stars and a red chalice are the most important surviving features.

[[File:Petra-Mosaic-2-2.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail from the mosaic floor of the [[Petra|Petra Church]]]]
Mosaic art also flourished in Christian [[Petra]] where three Byzantine churches were discovered. The most important one was uncovered in 1990. It is known that the walls were also covered with golden glass mosaics but only the floor panels survived as usual. The mosaic of the seasons in the southern aisle is from this first building period from the middle of the 5th century. In the first half of the 6th century the mosaics of the northern aisle and the eastern end of the southern aisle were installed. They depict native as well as exotic or mythological animals, and personifications of the Seasons, Ocean, Earth and Wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mosaicartsource.wordpress.com/2007/01/21/petra-church-mosaic-floors-petra-jordan/ Petra Church – Mosaic Floors – Petra, Jordan « Mosaic Art Source&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab conquest of the [[Middle East]] in the 7th century did not break off the art of mosaic making. Arabs learned and accepted the craft as their own and carried on the classical tradition. During the Umayyad era Christianity retained its importance, churches were built and repaired and some of the most important mosaics of the Christian East were made during the 8th century when the region was under Islamic rule.

The mosaics of the Church of St Stephen in ancient Kastron Mefaa (now [[Umm ar-Rasas]]) were made in 785 (discovered after 1986). The perfectly preserved mosaic floor is the largest one in Jordan. On the central panel hunting and fishing scenes are depicted while another panel illustrates the most important cities of the region. The frame of the mosaic is especially decorative. Six mosaic masters signed the work: Staurachios from Esbus, Euremios, Elias, Constantinus, Germanus and Abdela. It overlays another, damaged, mosaic floor of the earlier (587) "Church of Bishop Sergius." Another four churches were excavated nearby with traces of mosaic decoration.

The last great mosaics in Madaba were made in 767 in the Church of the Virgin Mary (discovered in 1887). It is a masterpiece of the geometric style with a Greek inscription in the central medallion.

With the fall of the [[Umayyad dynasty]] in 750 the Middle East went through deep cultural changes. No great mosaics were made after the end of the 8th century and the majority of churches gradually fell into disrepair and were eventually destroyed. The tradition of mosaic making died out among the Christians and also in the Islamic community.

====Orthodox countries====
[[File:Michael of salonica.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Early 12th-century [[Kiev]]an mosaic depicting [[St. Demetrius]].]]

The craft has also been popular in early medieval [[Rus' (people)|Rus]], inherited as part of the Byzantine tradition. [[Yaroslav I the Wise|Yaroslav]], the Grand Prince of the [[Kievan Rus']] built a large cathedral in his capital, [[Kiev]]. The model of the church was the [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], and it was also called [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]]. It was built mainly by Byzantine master craftsmen, sent by [[Constantine IX Monomachos|Constantine Monomachos]], between 1037 and 1046. Naturally the more important surfaces in the interior were decorated with golden mosaics. In the dome we can see the traditional stern [[Christ Pantocrator|Pantokrator]] supported by angels. Between the 12 windows of the drum were apostles and the four evangelists on the pendentives. The apse is dominated by an orant [[Theotokos]] with a [[Deesis]] in three medallions above. Below is a Communion of the Apostles.
[[File:Gelati conch mosaic.JPG|thumb|left|Apse mosaic "Glory of the Theotokos" in [[Gelati Monastery|Gelati]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. c. 1125–1130.]]
Prince [[Sviatopolk II of Kiev|Sviatopolk II]] built [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] in [[Kiev]] in 1108. The mosaics of the church are undoubtedly works of Byzantine artists. Although the church was destroyed by Soviet authorities, majority of the panels were preserved. Small parts of ornamental mosaic decoration from the 12th century survived in the [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Novgorod|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Novgorod]] but this church was largely decorated with frescoes.

Using mosaics and frescoes in the same building was a unique practice in Ukraine. Harmony was achieved by using the same dominant colors in mosaic and fresco. Both Saint Sophia Cathedral and Saint Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery in Kiev use this technique.&lt;ref name="Internet encyclopedia of Ukraine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/Art.asp|title=The art of fresco painting in Ukraine|work=Internet encyclopedia of Ukraine|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosaics stopped being used for church decoration as early as the 12th century in the eastern Slavic countries. Later Russian churches were decorated with frescoes, similarly then orthodox churches in the Balkan.

The apse mosaic of the [[Gelati Monastery]] is a rare example of mosaic use in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Began by king [[David IV of Georgia|David IV]] and completed by his son [[Demetrius I of Georgia]], the fragmentary panel depicts Theotokos flanked by two archangels. The use of mosaic in Gelati attests to some Byzantine influence in the country and was a demonstration of the imperial ambition of the Bagrationids. The mosaic covered church could compete in magnificence with the churches of Constantinople. Gelati is one of few mosaic creations which survived in Georgia but fragments prove that the early churches of Pitsunda and Tsromi were also decorated with mosaic as well as other, lesser known sites. The destroyed 6th century mosaic floors in the [[Pitsunda Cathedral]] have been inspired by Roman prototypes. In [[Tsromi]] the tesserae are still visible on the walls of the 7th-century church but only faint lines hint at the original scheme. Its central figure was Christ standing and displaying a scroll with Georgian text.

===Jewish mosaics===
[[File:ZodiacMosaicTzippori.jpg|thumb|right|[[Zodiac]] wheel on the floor of the [[synagogue]] in [[Sepphoris]]]]
Under Roman and Byzantine influence the Jews also decorated their [[synagogue]]s with classical floor mosaics. Many interesting examples were discovered in [[Galilee]] and the [[Judean Desert]].

The remains of a 6th-century synagogue have been uncovered in [[Sepphoris]], which was an important centre of Jewish culture between the 3rd–7th centuries and a multicultural town inhabited by Jews, Christians and pagans. The mosaic reflects an interesting fusion of Jewish and pagan beliefs. In the center of the floor the [[zodiac]] wheel was depicted. [[Helios]] sits in the middle, in his sun chariot, and each [[zodiac]] is matched with a [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish month]]. Along the sides of the mosaic are strips depicting Biblical scenes, such as the binding of [[Isaac]], as well as traditional rituals, including a burnt sacrifice and the offering of fruits and grains.

Another zodiac mosaic decorated the floor of the [[Beit Alfa]] synagogue which was built during the reign of [[Justin I]] (518–27). It is regarded one of the most important mosaics discovered in Israel. Each of its three panels depicts a scene – the Holy Ark, the zodiac, and the story of the sacrifice of Isaac. In the center of the zodiac is [[Helios]], the sun god, in his chariot. The four women in the corners of the mosaic represent the four seasons.

A third superbly preserved zodiac mosaic was discovered in the [[Severus synagogue]] in the ancient resort town of [[Tiberias|Hammat Tiberias]]. In the center of the 4th-century mosaic the Sun god, Helios sits in his chariot holding the celestial sphere and a whip. Nine of the 12 signs of the zodiac survived intact. Another panel shows the Ark of Covenant and Jewish cultic objects used in the Temple at Jerusalem.

In 1936, a synagogue was excavated in [[Jericho]] which was named [[Shalom Al Yisrael Synagogue]] after an inscription on its mosaic floor ("Peace on Israel"). It appears to have been in use from the 5th to 8th centuries and contained a big mosaic on the floor with drawings of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], the [[Menorah (Temple)|Menorah]], a [[Shofar]] and a [[Lulav]]. Nearby in [[Naaran]], there is another synagogue (discovered in 1918) from the 6th century that also has a mosaic floor.

The synagogue in [[Eshtemoa synagogue|Eshtemoa]] ([[As-Samu]]) was built around the 4th century. The mosaic floor is decorated with only floral and geometric patterns. The synagogue in [[Khirbet Susiya]] (excavated in 1971–72, founded in the end of the 4th century) has three mosaic panels, the eastern one depicting a [[Torah]] shrine, two [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]]s, a [[lulav]] and an [[Etrog (ritual)|etrog]] with columns, deer and rams. The central panel is geometric while the western one is seriously damaged but it has been suggested that it depicted [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] in the lion’s den. The Roman synagogue in [[Ein Gedi]] was remodeled in the Byzantine era and a more elaborate mosaic floor was laid down above the older white panels. The usual geometric design was enriched with birds in the center. It includes the names of the signs of the zodiac and important figures from the Jewish past but not their images suggesting that it served a rather conservative community.

The ban on figurative depiction was not taken so seriously by the Jews living in Byzantine [[Gaza City|Gaza]]. In 1966 remains of a synagogue were found in the ancient harbour area. Its mosaic floor depicts [[King David]] as [[Orpheus]], identified by his name in Hebrew letters. Near him were lion cubs, a giraffe and a snake listening to him playing a lyre. A further portion of the floor was divided by medallions formed by vine leaves, each of which contains an animal: a lioness suckling her cub, a giraffe, peacocks, panthers, bears, a zebra and so on. The floor was paved in 508/509. It is very similar to that of the synagogue at Maon (Menois) and the Christian church at [[Shellal (Palestine)|Shellal]], suggesting that the same artist most probably worked at all three places.

The House of Leontius in [[Bet She'an]] (excavated in 1964–72) is a rare example of a synagogue which was part of an inn. It was built in the Byzantine period. The colorful mosaic floor of the synagogue room had an outer stripe decorated with flowers and birds, around medallions with animals, created by [[vine trellises]] emerging from an amphora. The central medallion enclosed a menorah (candelabrum) beneath the word shalom (peace).

A 5th-century building in [[Huldah]] may be a [[Samaritan]] synagogue. Its mosaic floor contains typical Jewish symbols (menorah, lulav, etrog) but the inscriptions are Greek. Another Samaritan synagogue with a mosaic floor was located in Bet She'an (excavated in 1960). The floor had only decorative motifs and an aedicule (shrine) with cultic symbols. The ban on human or animal images was more strictly observed by the Samaritans than their Jewish neighbours in the same town (see above). The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue. One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script.

In 2003, a synagogue of the 5th or 6th century was uncovered in the coastal Ionian town of [[Saranda]], [[Albania]]. It had exceptional mosaics depicting items associated with Jewish holidays, including a menorah, ram's horn, and lemon tree. Mosaics in the basilica of the synagogue show the facade of what resembles a [[Torah]], animals, trees, and other biblical symbols. The structure measures 20 by 24 m. and was probably last used in the 6th century as a church.

====Pre-Islamic Arabia====
In South Arabia two mosaic works were excavated in a Qatabanian from the late 3rd century, those two plates formed geometric and grapevines formation reflecting the traditions of that culture. In the [[Ghassanid]] era religious mosaic art flourished in their territory, so far five churches with mosaic were recorded from that era, two built by Ghassanid rulers and the other three by the Christian Arab community who wrote their names and dedications.

[[File:Bishapur zan.jpg|thumb|upright|Floor pavement representing female dancers, Shapur palace, [[Bishapur]]]]

====Pre-Islamic Persia====
Tilework had been known there for about two thousand years when cultural exchange between [[Sassanid Empire]] and Romans influenced [[Persian people|Persian]] artists to create mosaic patterns. [[Shapur I]] decorated his palace with tile compositions depicting dancers, musicians, courtesans, etc. This was the only significant example of [[figurative art|figurative]] Persian mosaic, which became prohibited after [[Islamic conquest of Persia|Arab conquest]] and arrival of [[Islam]].

====Islamic art====

=====Arab=====
[[File:Arabischer Maler um 690 002.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Islamic mosaics inside the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] (c. 690)]]

[[Islamic architecture]] used mosaic technique to decorate religious buildings and palaces after the [[Muslim conquests]] of the eastern provinces of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In [[Syria]] and [[Egypt]] the Arabs were influenced by the great tradition of Roman and Early Christian mosaic art. During the [[Umayyad Dynasty]] mosaic making remained a flourishing art form in Islamic culture and it is continued in the art of [[zellige]] and [[azulejo]] in various parts of the Arab world, although [[tile]] was to become the main Islamic form of wall decoration.

The first great religious building of [[Islam]], the [[Dome of the Rock]] in [[Jerusalem]], which was built between 688–692, was decorated with glass mosaics both inside and outside, by craftsmen of the Byzantine tradition. Only parts of the original interior decoration survive. The rich floral motifs follow Byzantine traditions, and are "Islamic only in the sense that the vocabulary is syncretic and does not include representation of men or animals."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacredsites.com/middle_east/israel/jerusalem.html Jerusalem, Israel]. sacredsites.com. Retrieved on 12 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arabischer Mosaizist um 735 001.jpg|thumb|The Umayyad mosaics of [[Hisham's Palace]] closely followed classical traditions]]
The most important early Islamic mosaic work is the decoration of the [[Umayyad Mosque]] in [[Damascus]], then capital of the [[Arab Caliphate]]. The mosque was built between 706 and 715. The caliph obtained 200 skilled workers from the Byzantine Emperor to decorate the building. This is evidenced by the partly Byzantine style of the decoration. The mosaics of the inner courtyard depict Paradise with beautiful trees, flowers and small hill towns and villages in the background. The mosaics include no human figures, which makes them different from the otherwise similar contemporary Byzantine works. The biggest continuous section survives under the western arcade of the courtyard, called the "Barada Panel" after the river [[Barada]]. It is thought that the mosque used to have the largest gold mosaic in the world, at over 4 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In 1893 a fire damaged the mosque extensively, and many mosaics were lost, although some have been restored since.

The mosaics of the Umayyad Mosque gave inspiration to later Damascene mosaic works. The Dome of the Treasury, which stands in the mosque courtyard, is covered with fine mosaics, probably dating from 13th- or 14th-century restoration work. The style of them are strikingly similar to the Barada Panel. The mausoleum of Sultan [[Baibars]], [[Az-Zahiriyah library|Madrassa Zahiriyah]], which was built after 1277, is also decorated with a band of golden floral and architectural mosaics, running around inside the main prayer hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 Zahiriyya Madrasa and Mausoleum of Sultan al-Zahir Baybars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108224216/http://www.archnet.org/library/sites/one-site.jsp?site_id=2777 |date=8 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-religious Umayyad mosaic works were mainly floor panels which decorated the palaces of the caliphs and other high-ranking officials. They were closely modeled after the mosaics of the Roman country villas, once common in the Eastern Mediterranean. The most superb example can be found in the bath house of [[Hisham's Palace]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] which was made around 744. The main panel depicts a large tree and underneath it a lion attacking a deer (right side) and two deers peacefully grazing (left side). The panel probably represents good and bad governance. Mosaics with classical geometric motifs survived in the bath area of the 8th-century Umayyad palace complex in [[Anjar, Lebanon|Anjar]], [[Lebanon]]. The luxurious desert residence of [[Al-Walid II]] in [[Qasr al-Hallabat]] (in present-day [[Jordan]]) was also decorated with floor mosaics that show a high level of technical skill. The best preserved panel at Hallabat is divided by a Tree of Life flanked by "good" animals on one side and "bad" animals on the other. Among the Hallabat representations are vine scrolls, grapes, pomegranates, oryx, wolves, hares, a leopard, pairs of partridges, fish, bulls, ostriches, rabbits, rams, goats, lions and a snake. At [[Qastal, Jordan|Qastal]], near [[Amman]], excavations in 2000 uncovered the earliest known Umayyad mosaics in present-day [[Jordan]], dating probably from the caliphate of [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] (685–705). They cover much of the floor of a finely decorated building that probably served as the palace of a local governor. The Qastal mosaics depict geometrical patterns, trees, animals, fruits and rosettes. Except for the open courtyard, entrance and staircases, the floors of the entire palace were covered in mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/198701/mosaic.country.htm Saudi Aramco World : Mosaic Country]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cordoba moschee innen5 dome.jpg|thumb|right|Golden mosaics in the dome of the [[Mezquita de Córdoba|Great Mosque]] in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Corduba]], Moorish Spain (965–970)]]

Some of the best examples of later Islamic mosaics were produced in [[Moorish]] [[Spain]]. The golden mosaics in the [[mihrab]] and the central dome of the [[Mezquita de Córdoba|Great Mosque]] in [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Corduba]] have a decidedly Byzantine character. They were made between 965 and 970 by local craftsmen, supervised by a master mosaicist from [[Constantinople]], who was sent by the Byzantine Emperor to the Umayyad Caliph of Spain. The decoration is composed of colorful floral [[arabesques]] and wide bands of Arab [[calligraphy]]. The mosaics were purported to evoke the glamour of the Great Mosque in Damascus, which was lost for the Umayyad family.&lt;ref&gt;Marianne Barrucand – Achim Bednorz: Moorish Architecture in Andalusia, Taschen, 2002, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

Mosaics generally went out of fashion in the Islamic world after the 8th century. Similar effects were achieved by the use of painted tilework, either geometric with small tiles, sometimes called mosaic, like the [[zillij]] of [[North Africa]], or larger tiles painted with parts of a large decorative scheme ([[Qashani]]) in Persia, Turkey and further east.

==Modern mosaics==

[[File:Marcelo de Melo Running Rug.jpg|thumb|''Running Rug'', 2001 – structural mosaic work by [[Marcelo de Melo]]]]
Noted 19th-century mosaics include those by [[Edward Burne-Jones]] at St Pauls within the Walls in [[Rome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/bj/mosaic/index.html |title=Photos of Burne-Jones mosaics in Rome at The Victorian Web |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another modern mosaic of note is the world's largest mosaic installation located at the [[Cathedral Basilica of St. Louis]], located in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://explorestlouis.com/visit-explore/discover/25-things-to-do-in-st-louis/|title=25 Things to Do in St. Louis|author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern example of mosaic is the [[81st Street – Museum of Natural History (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|Museum of Natural History]] station of the [[New York City Subway]] (there are many [[New York City Subway tiles|such works of art]] scattered throughout the New York City subway system, though many [[Independent Subway System|IND]] stations are usually designed with bland mosaics.) Another example of mosaics in ordinary surroundings is the use of locally themed mosaics in some restrooms in the [[rest area]]s along some Texas interstate highways.

Some modern mosaics are the work of ''[[modernisme]]'' style architects [[Antoni Gaudí]] and [[Josep Maria Jujol]], for example the mosaics in the [[Park Güell]] in [[Barcelona]]. Today, among the leading figures of the mosaic world are [[Emma Biggs]] (UK), [[Marcelo de Melo]] (Brazil), [[Sonia King]] (USA) and [[Saimir Strati]] (Albania).

===Mosaics as a popular craft===
[[File:Bottlecap mosaic.jpg|thumb|upright|A detail of mosaic mural made of modern bottle screw tops. A high school in Jerusalem, Israel]]
Mosaics have developed into a popular craft and art, and are not limited to professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to... Mosaic |url=http://www.hobbycraft.co.uk/supplyimages/wf1002/how-to-mosaic-tiles.pdf |publisher=Hobbycraft |accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today's artisans and crafters work with stone, ceramics, shells, art glass, mirror, beads, and even odd items like doll parts, pearls, or photographs. While ancient mosaics tended to be architectural, modern mosaics are found covering everything from park benches and flowerpots to guitars and bicycles. Items can be as small as an earring or as large as a house.

===Mosaics in street art===
[[File:Space Invader - 2007 - Shoreditch - 1.jpg|thumb|left|A work by [[Invader (artist)|Invader]] in [[Emaux de Briare]].]]
In styles that owe as much to videogame pixel art and popculture as to traditional mosaic, street art has seen a novel reinvention and expansion of mosaic artwork. The most prominent artist working with mosaics in street art is the French [[Invader (artist)|Invader]]. He has done almost all his work in two very distinct mosaic styles, the first of which are small "traditional" tile mosaics of 8 bit video game character, installed in cities across the globe, and the second of which are a style he refers to as "Rubikcubism", which uses a kind of dual layer mosaic via grids of scrambled Rubik's Cubes. Although he is the most prominent, other street and urban artists do work in Mosaic styles as well.

===Calçada Portuguesa===
{{Main article|Portuguese pavement}}
[[File:CopacabanaPavement.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro)]]]]
Portuguese pavement (in [[Portuguese Language|Portuguese]], ''Calçada Portuguesa'') is a kind of two-tone stone mosaic paving created in Portugal, and common throughout the [[Lusosphere]]. Most commonly taking the form of geometric patterns from the simple to the complex, it also is used to create complex pictorial mosaics in styles ranging from iconography to classicism and even modern design. In Portuguese-speaking countries, many cities have a large amount of their sidewalks and even, though far more occasionally, streets done in this mosaic form. [[Lisbon]] in particular maintains almost all walkways in this style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Portuguese Pavements A Calçada Portuguesa |url=http://www.lisbonlux.com/culture/calcada-portuguesa.html |publisher=Lisbon Lux |accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mosaic art at Bonifacio High Street.jpg|thumb|Mosaic art at [[Bonifacio High Street]] in [[Bonifacio Global City]], [[Philippines]]]]
Despite its prevalence and popularity throughout Portugal and its former colonies, and its relation to older art and architectural styles like [[Azulejo]], Portuguese and Spanish painted tilework, it is a relatively young mosaic artform, its first definitive appearance in a modernly recognizable form being in the mid-1800s. Among the most commonly used stones in this style are [[basalt]] and [[limestone]].

==Terminology==
[[File:Fernand Léger - Grand parade with red background (mosaic) 1958 made.jpg|thumb|[[:en:Fernand Léger|Fernand Léger]] – Grand parade with red background, mosaic 1958 (designed 1953). [[:en:National Gallery of Victoria|National Gallery of Victoria]] (NGV), [[:en:Australia|Australia]]]]
Mosaic is an art form which uses small pieces of materials placed together to create a unified whole. The materials commonly used are marble or other stone, glass, [[pottery]], mirror or foil-backed glass, or shells.

The word ''mosaic'' is from the Italian ''mosaico'' deriving from the Latin ''mosaicus'' and ultimately from the Greek ''mouseios'' meaning ''belonging to the [[Muses]]'', hence artistic. Each piece of material is a [[Tessera]] (plural: ''tesserae''). The space in between where the grout goes is an interstice. [[Andamento]] is the word used to describe the movement and flow of [[Tesserae]]. The 'opus', the Latin for ‘work’, is the way in which the pieces are cut and placed.

Common techniques include:
* [[Opus regulatum]]: A grid; all tesserae align both vertically and horizontally.
* [[Opus tessellatum]]: Tesserae form vertical or horizontal rows, but not both.
* [[Opus vermiculatum]]: One or more lines of tesserae follow the edge of a special shape (letters or a major central graphic).
* [[Opus musivum]]: Vermiculatum extends throughout the entire background.
* [[Opus palladianum]]: Instead of forming rows, tesserae are irregularly shaped.  Also known as "crazy paving".
* [[Opus sectile]]: A major shape (e.g. heart, letter, cat) is formed by a single tessera, as later in [[pietra dura]].
* [[Opus classicum]]: When vermiculatum is combined with tessellatum or regulatum.
* [[Opus circumactum]]: Tesserae are laid in overlapping semicircles or fan shapes.
* [[Micromosaic]]: using very small tesserae, in [[Byzantine]] [[icon]]s and Italian panels for jewellery from the Renaissance on.

==Three techniques==
[[File:Ancient Roman Mosaics Villa Romana La Olmeda 021 Pedrosa De La Vega - Saldaña (Palencia).JPG|thumb|upright|Tool table for ancient Roman mosaics at Roman villa of [[La Olmeda]] in [[Pedrosa de la Vega]], [[Province of Palencia]] ([[Castile and León]], [[Spain]]).]][[File:Hammer and hardie.jpg|thumb|These are the hammer and hardie, mosaic tools used for cutting stone by Italian mosaic artists]]
There are three main methods: the direct method, the indirect method and the double indirect method.

===Direct method===
[[File:Li Jiang Guesthouse.jpg|right|thumb|A 'Direct Method' mosaic courtyard made from irregular pebbles and stone strips, [[Lijiang City|Li Jiang]], [[Yunnan]], [[People's Republic of China|PRC]] (China)]]

The direct method of mosaic construction involves directly placing (gluing) the individual [[tessera]]e onto the supporting surface. This method is well suited to surfaces that have a three-dimensional quality, such as vases.  This was used for the historic European wall and ceiling mosaics, following [[underdrawing]]s of the main outlines on the wall below, which are often revealed again when the mosaic falls away.

The direct method suits small projects that are transportable. Another advantage of the direct method is that the resulting mosaic is progressively visible, allowing for any adjustments to tile color or placement.

The disadvantage of the direct method is that the artist must work directly at the chosen surface, which is often not practical for long periods of time, especially for large-scale projects. Also, it is difficult to control the evenness of the finished surface. This is of particular importance when creating a functional surface such as a floor or a table top.

A modern version of the direct method, sometimes called "double direct," is to work directly onto fiberglass mesh. The mosaic can then be constructed with the design visible on the surface and transported to its final location. Large work can be done in this way, with the mosaic being cut up for shipping and then reassembled for installation. It enables the artist to work in comfort in a studio rather than at the site of installation.

===Indirect method===
The indirect method of applying tesserae is often used for very large projects, projects with repetitive elements or for areas needing site specific shapes. Tiles are applied face-down to a backing paper using an adhesive, and later transferred onto walls, floors or craft projects. This method is most useful for extremely large projects as it gives the maker time to rework areas, allows the cementing of the tiles to the backing panel to be carried out quickly in one operation and helps ensure that the front surfaces of the mosaic tiles and mosaic pieces are flat and in the same plane on the front, even when using tiles and pieces of differing thicknesses. Mosaic murals, benches and tabletops are some of the items usually made using the indirect method, as it results in a smoother and more even surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mosaiclegs.com/ |title=Indirect Method Mosaic studio |year=1999 |accessdate=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double indirect method===
{{Disputed section|date=October 2017}}
The double indirect method can be used when it is important to see the work during the creation process as it will appear when completed. The tesserae are placed face-up on a medium (often adhesive-backed paper, sticky plastic or soft lime or putty) as it will appear when installed. When the mosaic is complete, a similar medium is placed atop it. The piece is then turned over, the original underlying material is carefully removed, and the piece is installed as in the indirect method described above. In comparison to the indirect method, this is a complex system to use and requires great skill on the part of the operator, to avoid damaging the work. Its greatest advantage lies in the possibility of the operator directly controlling the final result of the work, which is important e.g. when the human figure is involved.
This method was created in 1989 by Maurizio Placuzzi and registered for industrial use (patent n. [http://www.uibm.gov.it/uibm/dati/Codice.aspx?load=info_list_uno&amp;id=127474&amp;table=UtilityModel 0000222556]) under the name of his company, Sicis International Srl, now Sicis The Art Mosaic Factory Srl.

==Mathematics==
{{further information|tessellation|mathematics and art}}

The best way to arrange variously shaped tiles on a surface leads to the mathematical field of [[tessellation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | ref=harv | authorlink=H.S.M. Coxeter | last=Coxeter | first=H.S.M. | titlelink=Regular Polytopes (book) | title=Regular Polytopes, Section IV : Tessellations and Honeycombs | publisher=Dover | year=1973 | isbn=0-486-61480-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[M. C. Escher]] was influenced by Moorish mosaics to begin his investigations into tessellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Roza |first=Greg |title=An Optical Artist: Exploring Patterns and Symmetry |year=2005 |publisher=Rosen Classroom |isbn=978-1-4042-5117-5 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--should also discuss [[Girih tiles]] here--&gt;

==Digital imaging==
A mosaic in [[digital imaging]] is a plurality of non-overlapping images, arranged in some [[tessellation]]. A [[photomosaic]] is a picture made up of various other pictures (pioneered by Joseph Francis), in which each "[[pixel]]" is another picture, when examined closely. This form has been adopted in many modern media and digital [[image search]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thudit.com/|title=Search Pictures In Mosaic Format|author=|date=|work=|publisher=|accessdate=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120613180134/http://www.thudit.com/|archivedate=13 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A tile mosaic is a [[digital image]] made up of individual [[tile]]s, arranged in a non-overlapping fashion, e.g. to make a static image on a shower room or bathing pool floor, by breaking the image down into square pixels formed from ceramic tiles (a typical size is {{convert|1|x|1|in|mm|abbr=on}}, as for example, on the floor of the [[University of Toronto]] pool, though sometimes larger tiles such as {{convert|2|x|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} are used). These digital images are coarse in resolution and often simply express text, such as the depth of the pool in various places, but some such digital images are used to show a sunset or other beach theme.

Recent developments in digital image processing have led to the ability to design physical tile mosaics using [[computer aided design]] (CAD) software. The software typically takes as inputs a source [[bitmap]] and a [[Palette (computing)|palette]] of colored tiles.  The software makes a [[best-fit]] match of the tiles to the source image.
{{Clear}}

==Robotic manufacturing==
With high cost of labor in developed countries, production [[automation]] has become increasingly popular. Rather than being assembled by hand, mosaics designed using [[computer aided design]] (CAD) software can be assembled by a robot. Production can be greater than 10 times faster with higher accuracy.  But these "computer" mosaics have a different look than hand-made "artisanal" mosaics.  With robotic production, colored tiles are loaded into [[wikt:buffer|buffers]], and then the robot picks and places tiles individually according to a command file from the design software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artaic.com/ |title=Automated Custom Mosaics |year=2011 |accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Passerini Assumption''''' (Italian: ''Assunta Passerini'') is a painting by Italian Renaissance artist [[Andrea del Sarto]], painted in 1526. It is housed in the [[Galleria Palatina]] of [[Palazzo Pitti]], [[Florence]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The work was commissioned by Margherita Passerini for her private altar in church of  Santa Maria fuori le mura at [[Cortona]]: the contract is dated 1526, for a price of 155 [[florin (Italian coin)|florins]]. In 1553 the friars of that church moved, together with their properties including this artwork, to the church of Sant'Antonio dei Servi. 

In 1639 the panel was acquired by Grand Duke [[Ferdinand II de' Medici]]; a copy paid by him to remain in the church is now in the Diocesan Museum of Cortona. the work later was moved to the current location, in pair with the similar [[Panciatichi Assumption]] also by Andrea del Sarto. 

==Description==
Andrea del Sarto painted this work using his previous [[Panciatichi Assumption]] as model. the few variants include the dark background, instead of a landscape, the different position of Mary and the angels around her, and the replacement of the right kneeling apostle with Blessed  [[Margaret of Cortona]], who was the donor's protector. The left apostle was replaced by [[St. Nicholas]], patron of the donor's father or dead son.

At the time of the execution of this version, Andrea del Sarto was already married, and (as mentioned by late biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]]) Mary's face is likely a portrait of his wife.

[[File:Peep Show by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Exterior of a [[sex shop]] in [[New York City]] that also provides a peep show]]

A '''peep show''' or '''peepshow''' is an exhibition of pictures, objects or people viewed through a small hole or [[magnifying glass]]. Though historically a peep show was a form of entertainment provided by wandering showmen, nowadays it more commonly refers to a presentation of a [[sex show]] or [[pornographic film]] which is viewed through a viewing slot. Historically the peep hole was intended to control the point of view to allow an illusion of [[depth perception]], while showmen would later use it to charge for access to the view. For sex shows it also became a means to view material that would be objected to if freely displayed.

==History==
[[File:Adolph Glasbrenner Guckkästner.jpg|thumb|left|175px|A boy looks into a peep show device (illustration by [[Theodor Hosemann]], 1835)]]
Peep shows,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Weynants, [http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html "From the Rarekiek, 17th. &amp; 18th. Century optical entertainment, to the birth of Television"]
&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''peep box''' or '''raree show''' ("rarity show") can be traced back to the [[early modern period]] (15th century in Europe) and are known in various cultures. 
Around 1437 Italian humanist author, artist, architect, poet, priest, linguist, philosopher and cryptographer [[Leon Battista Alberti]] is thought to have created the earliest impressive peep show boxes with painted pictures to be viewed through a small hole. He had two kinds: night scenes with the moon and stars, and day scenes. It is thought these pictures may have been transparent and lit from behind, possibly changing from day to night by changing the lighting. It has also been suggested that it may have been a predecessor of the [[magic lantern]] that could project images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/c/camera_obscura.html|title=Camera Obscura - Encyclopedia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/peep-show-childrens-toy|title=Peep show - children’s toy|author=|date=|website=britannica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 17th and 18th century peep shows were exhibited on streets and fairs across Europe by itinerant showmen, competing with other entertainment like dancing bears, jugglers, conjurers, et cetera.&lt;ref name=balzer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dickbalzer.com/Peepshows.202.0.html|title=Dick Balzer's Website: Peepshows|first=Richard|last=Balzer|date=|website=www.dickbalzer.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their wooden cabinets could have several viewing holes and contain sets of pictures to be set into a viewing position by pulling a corresponding string. The show was accompanied by spoken [[recitation]] that explained or dramatized what was happening inside. The boxes were often decorated inside to resemble theatrical scenes.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} 

Peep shows were most popular in the 17th century in Holland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100313907|title=Peep-show box - Oxford Reference|author=|date=|website=oxfordreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some artists from the 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], like [[Pieter Janssens Elinga]] and [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] created a type of peep shows with an illusion of depth perception by manipulating the perspective of the view seen inside, usually the interior of a room.
From around 1700 many of these "perspective boxes" or "optica" had a bi-convex lens with a large diameter and small dioptre for an exaggerated perspective, giving a stronger illusion of depth. Most pictures showed architectural and topographical subjects with linear perspectives.&lt;ref name=visualmedia&gt;{{cite web|title=Peepshow|url=http://www.visual-media.eu/vue-optique.html|website=visual-media.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dutch Perspectives|last1=Wagenaar|last2=Duller|last3=Wagenaar-Fischer}}&lt;/ref&gt; From around 1745 similar perspective view prints became very popular for the [[zograscope]], which used the same principle with the lens on a stand rather than in a box.   
Peep shows were further developed with translucent painting techniques, perforations and cut-out shapes that provided special effects when lit from behind by candles. Changing the light from the front to the back of the picture could change the scene from day to night, much like the [[dissolving views]] that would later become a popular type of magic lantern show.&lt;ref name=visualmedia/&gt;

In the early 18th century the perspective boxes were very appreciated in Japan, where they were referred to as ''Holland machines''.&lt;ref name=balzer/&gt; They may have been imported from China earlier than from The Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/TowardAStudentBasedApproachToTranslationTeaching/toward+a+student-based+approach+to+translation+teaching_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Toward A Student Based Approach To Translation Teaching"|author=|date=|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

19th-century Chinese peep shows were known by many names including ''la yang p'ien'' ({{zh|c=拉洋片|p=lā yáng piān|l=pulling foreign picture cards}}). Sometimes the showman would perform for a crowd with [[puppet]]s or [[cantastoria|pictures]] outside the box and then charge people extra to look through the holes.
In [[Ottoman Syria]] a form of peep show called ''sanduk al-ajayib'' ("wonder box") existed, which the storyteller carried on his back. The box had six holes through which people could see scenes backlit by a central candle. ''Sanduk al-ajayib'' stories were about contemporary figures and events, or showed scenes of heaven and hell.&lt;ref&gt;* Mair, Victor H. ''Painting and Performance: Chinese Picture Recitation and its Indian Genesis.'' Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other common subjects in peep shows throughout the world have been exotic views and animals, scenes of classical drama or [[masque]]s, [[Noble court|court]] ceremonies, surprise transformations (e.g., of an angel into a devil) and of course, lewd pictures.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
[[File:DonaldsonvillePeepShow1938.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A man peers into the viewer of a peepshow at a State Fair in 1938]]

Raree shows were precursors of [[toy theatre]]s, with movable scenes and paper figurines, popular in the 19th century. They can also be seen as predecessors to [[optical toys]] like [[Chinese fireworks]], the [[diorama]], the [[stereoscope]] and the [[magic lantern]].&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

Some peep shows offer the only accurate representation of the stage design and scenery of the [[masque]]s and pageants of their time.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt;

==Pornographic shows==
Peep shows have been used for erotic and pornographic pictures, such as ''[[What the Butler Saw (mutoscope)|What the Butler Saw]]'', since before the turn of the twentieth century. 

In contemporary use, a peep show is a piecewise presentation of [[pornographic film]]s or a live [[sex show]] which is viewed through a viewing slot, which shuts after the time paid for has expired. The viewing slots can be operated by a money box device, or paid for at a counter. 
[[File:Peep show Iran.JPG|thumbnail|Peep show in [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tehran]]]]
For live peep shows, booths can surround a stage upon which usually a female performer performs a [[striptease]] and sexually explicit poses. In [[Barcelona]] female performers at times also perform sexual intercourse with male performers on stage. In some cases, booths include [[paper towel dispenser]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Jon Griffin Donlon, "Peep Shows," ''St. James Encyclopedia of Pop Culture''. According to Dr. Elliot Chiu, "At first, small booths with a seat, a lock, and a roll of paper towels were made available for individual viewing of 8 or 16 mm stag loops or for access to a usually circular 'stage' with living performers."&lt;/ref&gt; for customers who engage in masturbation. A customer and performer can mutually agree on a fee for a "private dance", which can take place in a peep show booth with a clear window and seating space for only one spectator.

Research on peep show establishments in California&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Linz, Bryant Paul, and Mike Z. Yao, "Peep show establishments, police activity, public place, and time: A study of secondary effects in San Diego, California", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; examined the hypothesis that neighborhoods surrounding [[sex business]]es such as peep show establishments and [[X-rated]] movie stores have higher rates of crime. The researchers compared 911 calls in peep show and control neighborhoods in San Diego.  Although peep show neighborhoods had approximately 16 percent more calls, the researchers concluded that the difference was not statistically significant.  Other researchers reanalyzed the data and concluded that the difference was significant.&lt;ref&gt;Richard McCleary and James W. Meeker, "Do peep shows 'cause' crime?", ''The Journal of Sex Research'', May 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Regal Show World====
Regal Show World was an [[adult entertainment]] business on lower [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] in [[San Francisco, California]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company's [[slogan]] was "Where you are king".&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; The business had a peep show and an [[adult video arcade]].&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson 2012 p. 159"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Alta-glamour.com"/&gt; The peep show had performers working in an enclosed round room with viewing booths surrounding it and sometimes had a "double in the bubble" show in which two performers worked simultaneously.&lt;ref name="LNG"/&gt; During the winter of 1997 to 1998, the business had thirty-five performers.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At this time, over 80% of performers there attempted to [[unionize]] and "signed union authorization cards for representation by the [[Service Employees International Union]] (SEIU), Local 790".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;

The business was owned by Bijou Group, Inc., a [[privately held company]] in San Francisco that was founded in 1990.&lt;ref name="Manta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Find"/&gt; Bijou Group owned similar businesses in San Francisco such as New Century Theater, [[Market Street Cinema]], and the Campus Theater.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; Bijou Group, Inc. filed for [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] reorganization circa 1994.&lt;ref name="Nearby Café 1995"/&gt; In November 1998, management of Regal Show World announced that the peep show would be closed on November 30th of that month due to "economic reasons".&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; At the time, some performers in the industry stated that closure of the peep show was done as a retaliative measure against attempts for performers to unionize.&lt;ref name="EDA"/&gt; The company declared bankruptcy after performers made a second attempt at unionization, whereby the performers "signed cards calling for a union election", and the theater was closed.&lt;ref name="TPOS"/&gt;

===Washington===
The former [[Lusty Lady]] peep show in San Francisco, California, entered the news in 1997, when it became the first U.S. sex business to be [[unionized]]. In 2003 it was bought by the employees and became a [[worker cooperative]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

[[Image:Mosaicr seagull.jpg|thumb|200px|A photographic mosaic of a [[sea gull]] made from pictures of [[bird]]s and other [[nature]] photos using [[hexagon]]al tiles]]

In the field of photographic  imaging, a '''photographic mosaic''', also known under the term '''Photomosaic''', a [[portmanteau]] of photo and [[mosaic]], is a picture (usually a [[photograph]]) that has been divided into (usually equal sized) tiled sections, each of which is replaced with another photograph that matches the target photo.&lt;ref name="Cartwright07"&gt;Cartwright (2007) p.102 quote: Photographic mosaic, also known as Photomosaic, a portmanteau of photo and mosaic, is a picture that is divided into small sections. When viewed as a whole, it appears to be one image, when in fact the image is made up of hundreds or even thousands of smaller images.&lt;/ref&gt; When viewed at low magnifications, the individual [[pixel]]s appear as the primary image, while close examination reveals that the image is in fact made up of many hundreds or thousands of smaller images.&lt;ref name="Cartwright07"/&gt; Most of the time they are a computer-created type of [[Photomontage|montage]].

There are two kinds of mosaic, depending on how the matching is done.  In the simpler kind, each part of the target image is averaged down to a single color.  Each of the library images is also reduced to a single color.  Each part of the target image is then replaced with one from the library where these colors are as similar as possible.  In effect, the target image is reduced in resolution (by [[downsampling]]), and then each of the resulting pixels is replaced with an image whose average color matches that pixel.

In the more advanced kind of photographic mosaic, the target image is not downsampled, and the matching is done by comparing each pixel in the rectangle to the corresponding pixel from each library image.  The rectangle in the target is then replaced with the library image that minimizes the total difference.  This requires much more computation than the simple kind, but the results can be much better since the pixel-by-pixel matching can preserve the resolution of the target image.

Originally, the term ''photomosaic'' referred to compound photographs created by stitching together a series of adjacent pictures of a scene. Space scientists have been assembling mosaics of this kind since at least as early as the Soviet Union space satellite missions to the moon in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = To a Rocky Moon: A Geologist's History of Lunar Exploration|last = Wilhelms|first = Don E.|publisher = University of Arizona Press|year = 1993|isbn = |location = |pages = ii (Front Matter)|url = http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/books/rockyMoon/01FrontMatter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name photomosaic and an implementation concept were trademarked by Robert Silvers' Runaway Technology, Inc.&lt;ref name="USTradmarkOffice"/&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Photo-mosaic-Joseph-Francis.jpg|thumb|right|1993 ''Live from Bell Labs'' event poster]]
* '''1993''' Joseph Francis, working for R/Greenberg Associates in Manhattan, is believed to be the inventor of the modern-day computer-generated colour image versions. His ''Live from Bell Labs'' poster created in 1993 used computer-themed tile photographs to create a mosaic of a face ([[Ryszard Horowitz]]/ Photography and Art Direction, Robert Bowen/ Digital Artist). He went on to create a mosaic for ''Animation Magazine'' in 1993, which was repeated in ''Wired Magazine'' (November 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;106).  Francis has said on his "History of Photo Mosaics" webpage that his interest in developing these techniques further was in part stimulated by the work of artist [[Chuck Close]].
* '''1994''' [[Dave McKean]] creates an image for DC Comics, a mosaic of a face made from photos of faces, although this is believed to be created manually using Photoshop.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Jfk mosaic adam finkelstein.jpg|thumb|left|1994 John F. Kennedy mosaic, Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier]] --&gt;
* '''1994''' Adam Finkelstein and Sandy Farrier create a mosaic of [[John F. Kennedy]] from parts of Marilyn Monroe pictures. The result was displayed in the Xerox PARC Algorithmic Art Show in 1994.
* '''1994''' Benetton: AIDS - Faces mosaic. Over one thousand young peoples' portraits from all over the word computer-processed spell out the word AIDS.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gioconda Sapiens Spain Domus.jpg|thumb|right|1995 Gioconda Sapiens, Domus museum, Spain]] --&gt;
* '''1995''' The '' Gioconda Sapiens'', a face with ten thousand faces, was presented to the public in April 1995 (Spain, Domus museum). This was the first large photographic mosaic, using photographs of 10,062 people from 110 countries to make the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''.
* '''1995''' Adam Finkelstein (published mosaic in Mossy Bits) creates a mosaic of the oil painting ''[[American Gothic]]'' from images collected from the Web in early 1995.
* '''1995''' Robert Silvers creates an algorithm for generating Photomosaics programmatically and goes on to trademark the term Photomosaic and patent his process for creation of Photomosaics in 1997.

==Artistic aspects==
There is debate over whether Photomosaics are an art or mere technique.&lt;ref&gt;Silvers (2000) quote: "More than anything else people ask me whether Photomosaics are an art or a science. l tell them that Photomosaics, like any art in formative stage, has elements of both."&lt;/ref&gt; The making of a photomosaic is sometimes parallelled and compared to forms of [[artistic appropriation]], like [[literary assemblage]].&lt;ref name="Menke08p232"&gt;Menke (2008) p.232 quote: [In Rudyard Kipling's 1902 science-fiction short story "Wireless"] we recognize that the tale's marshalling of realistic particulars has also been a systematic importation of details from Keats's poetry and life history [...] The tale's elaborate descriptions were really Keats's pre-scriptions all along. As in a photomosaic image, the elements of the story that make it seem recognizable and real turn out to be chosen from an artificially constrained palette of appropriations; examined closely, each realistic detail reveals itself as a micro-quotation from that collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists such as [[David Hockney]], Christopher Kates and Pep Ventosa have pioneered their own photographic mosaic techniques where multiple photographs are taken of a scene and then pieced together again to create a cohesive image.

==Trademark and intellectual property of the concept==
Robert Silvers, a Master's student at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], filed for a [[trademark]] on the term ''Photomosaic'' on September 3, 1996. This trademark was registered on August 12, 2003.&lt;ref name="USTradmarkOffice"&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Trademark information for Trademark 75159436
  | publisher = US Trademark Office
  | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=75159436
  | accessdate = 2007-08-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvers also applied for a U.S. [[patent]] on the production of Photomosaics on January 2, 1997, which was granted as {{Cite patent|US|6137498}} in October 2000 and has been assigned to Runaway Technology, Inc. Patent applications in other countries were also filed, and patents granted include {{Cite patent|EP|0852363}}, {{Cite patent|JP|10269353}}, {{Cite patent|CA|2226059}}, and {{Cite patent|AU|723815B}}. He is quoted as saying: "By being granted this patent in the United States and other countries, we can protect our proprietary innovations and continue to make unique artwork." &lt;ref name="PhotomosaicCompay"&gt;{{cite web
 |url= http://www.photomosaic.com/corporate_patents.html
 |title= Robert Silvers {{!}} Corporate {{!}} Patents
 |first= Robert |last= Silvers
 |publisher= Runaway Technology, Inc.
 |accessdate= November 12, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the [[Public Patent Foundation]] filed a formal request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to review certain claims in the {{Cite patent|US|6137498}} on photomosaics. The request was granted and a reexamination proceeding ensued. On August 31, 2010, the USPTO issued a Reexamination Certificate confirming the patentability of all claims in the patent which were amended to refer to shape matching (a feature that contributes to the high resolution of photomosaics).

There are a number of other commercial companies that create mosaics with photos. Since there has been no litigation of these patents, these companies must therefore either use processes that do not infringe on the particular claimed process, have licenses under the patents, or are infringing those patents but Runaway Technology has chosen not to bring infringement proceedings.

Silvers' patent may be regarded as a [[software patent]], a subject over which there is a great deal of [[software patent debate|debate]]. For example, {{EPC Article|52|2|c}} states that "programs for computers as such" are not regarded as [[patentable subject matter|patentable inventions]]. Nevertheless, current practice relating to [[Software patents under the European Patent Convention|computer-implemented inventions under the EPC]] means that a process that provides a technical effect may be patented even if it is implemented by a computer.

The UK patent deriving from {{Cite patent|EP|0852363}} became the subject of revocation proceedings in July 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Using the [http://www.patent.gov.uk/patent/p-find/p-find-number.htm UK Patents Status Enquiry] for EP0852363 provides full details on the current status of the patent.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, the [[United Kingdom Patent Office|UK Intellectual Property Office]] (UK-IPO) decided that the patent should not be revoked and terminated the proceeding. The European patents expired on 31 December 2017.

==Video mosaic==
Photographic mosaics are typically formed from a collection of still images. A more recent phenomenon, however, has been video mosaics which assemble video clips rather than still images to create a larger image. The closing credits of the 2005 [[PlayStation 2]] game ''[[God of War (video game)|God of War]]'', for example, incorporates a still image of the main character, [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]], formed from a number of in-game videos.

The term "video mosaic" also describes a large still image made from adjacent frames of video, such as those from video shots of geographic features like roads or cities. A mosaic of the video's relevant frames replaces the full video, saving time and bandwidth, since the stills are much smaller.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2817">'''Pouncing''' is an art technique used for transferring an image from one surface to another.  It is similar to tracing, and is useful for creating copies of a sketch outline to produce finished works.
[[File:Tracing wheel - 01.jpg|thumb|A pounce wheel, also known as a tracing wheel]]
Pouncing has been a common technique for centuries, used to create copies of portraits and other works that would be finished as oil paintings, engravings, and so on. The most common method involves laying semi-transparent paper over the original image, then tracing along the lines of the image by creating pricked marks on the top sheet of paper.  This pounced drawing made of pricked holes is laid over a new working surface. A powder such as chalk, graphite or pastel is forced through the holes to leave an outline on the working surface below, thus transferring the image. The powder is applied by being placed into a small bag of thin fabric such as cheesecloth, then dabbed onto the pricked holes of the pounced drawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Judy|title=The Encyclopedia of Pastel Techniques|year=1992|publisher=Running Press|location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|isbn=1-56138-087-3|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Presbyterian Association of Musicians (PAM)''' is a national organization of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] for people who are involved in the areas of Reformed [[Christian worship]], [[Church music]], and liturgical arts.  The national offices for this 1,600 member organization are located in Louisville at the National Office of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]].  "Members of the Presbyterian Association of Musicians (PAM) include choir directors, organists, ministers, and other persons interested in the quality and integrity of music in the worship experience."  &lt;ref&gt;Presbyterian Church Office of the General Assembly, ''Book Of Order'', G-14.0741 Organized Associations, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
PAM's origins are rooted in the Montreat Worship and Music Conference which was created to provide professional support for Presbyterian musicians.  The [[Presbyterian Church USA#Governing bodies|Presbyterian General Assembly]] asked the Board of Christian Education to make a recommendation to create opportunities to educate church musicians.  On August 2, 1956 the first conference was held at the [[Montreat Conference Center]].  The purpose was to give "comprehensive and practical help to all people concerned with better church music."&lt;ref&gt;Snydor, James, ''1981 Silver Anniversary Year of Montreat Conference on Worship and Music'', March, 1981 PAM Newsletter.&lt;/ref&gt;

After fourteen years of the Montreat Worship and Music Conference, the Board of Christian Education was unable to continue financial support of the conference.  An ad hoc committee was formed to create an association for the musicians.  On July 26, 1970 the Presbyterian Association of Musicians was formed to support of the Montreat Worship and Music Conference.

==Worship and music conferences==
The week-long '''Montreat Worship and Music Conference''' is held at [[Montreat Conference Center]] and is repeated the following week.  This intergenerational conference offers a wide variety of classes and ensembles that provide musical, liturgical and theological instruction.

The '''Mo-Ranch/Presbyterian Association of Musicians Conference (MoPAM)''' is the union of two worship and music conferences.  The annual week-long [[Mo Ranch]] conference merged with the PAM West conference in 2009 to create an annual worship and music conference at Mo Ranch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moranch.com/index.php?c=12&amp;sn=123&amp;conf=12&amp;csn=92]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060116042336/http://www.moranch.com/index.php?c=12&amp;sn=123&amp;conf=12&amp;csn=92 |date=January 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

PAM has held biennial '''National Gatherings''' for church professionals since 2005 in partnership with Presbyterian Seminaries.  These gatherings, typically held in February, are two-three day conferences focusing on topics that are of importance to church musicians, pastors and educators who are working in the church.  The gatherings are open to all church professionals.

==Presbyterian hymnal==
The 2004 [[Presbyterian Church USA#Governing bodies|Presbyterian General Assembly]] gave authorization to the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation, the Presbyterian Association of Musicians, and the Office of Theology and Worship to begin research into the feasibility of a new Presbyterian hymnal. The results of this feasibility study were to be reported to the 217th General Assembly in 2006 which granted authorization for the Presbyterian Publishing Corporation to research, develop, and produce a new hymnal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://presbyterianhymnal.org/aboutTheProject.html|title=The Presbyterian Hymnal Project|publisher=Presbyterianhymnal.org|accessdate=31 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912123813/http://www.presbyterianhymnal.org/aboutTheProject.html|archivedate=12 September 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Proclamation of the German Empire''' (18 January 1871) is the title of several [[historical painting]]s by the German painter [[Anton von Werner]].

On 18 January 1871, Anton von Werner was present at the proclamation of the [[German Empire]] in [[Versailles]] in his capacity as a painter. In the following years, he produced several versions of the imperial proclamation at greater intervals, two of which were shown in prominent places in [[Berlin]]. Only a third version was preserved to [[Otto von Bismarck]]'s last residence, [[Friedrichsruh]], and is now open to the public. It is the most reproduced picture of the [[Founding of the German Empire#Imperial Proclamation in Versailles|Imperial Proclamation]].

Since the three paintings show strong differences, the images are of great documentary and historical dichotomy. Von Werner obviously adapted them to the wishes of his respective clients. The clothes worn by Bismarck in the first painting do not match with the other two paintings. Bismarck is wearing his white parade uniform in the second and third painting, which places him in the focus of the viewer. In fact, in Versailles, he was wearing a blue gun coat. In addition, he was holding the Order of [[Pour le Mérite]] on his white uniform, which he received in 1884. Minister of War [[Albrecht von Roon]], who did not participate in the proclamation of Versailles, was also included in the third version. In the first, second, and third paintings, the [[Frederick I, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke of Baden]] summons the new emperor. The perspective makes it appear that the imperial proclamation was above all a work of the princes and of the military.

Von Werner began working on the picture as one of the most active and influential German artists.

== First painting, 1877 ==
[[File:Die Kaiserproklamation 1871, Gemälde von 1877.png|thumb|On this reproduction of the painting, Werner's self-portrait can be seen on the extreme right margin (with a mustache).]]
[[File:Galerie des Glaces du Château de Versailles transformée en ambulance militaire.jpg|thumb|The [[Hall of Mirrors]] in the [[Palace of Versailles]]. A few days after the imperial proclamation, the victors of the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|Siege of Paris]] used it as a hospital (contemporary painting).]]
In 1870, von Werner spent the final phase of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] at the headquarters of the [[Franco-Prussian_War order of battle#Third Army|Third Army]] led by Prussian crown prince [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick William]]. In January 1871, the latter asked him to travel from [[Karlsruhe]] to the "Grand Headquarter" in the [[Palace of Versailles]] to "experience something worthy of your brush."&lt;ref&gt;Zitat bei Gaethgens: ''Anton von Werner, die Proklamierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs; ein Historienbild im Wandel preußischer Politik.'' Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1990, S. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Von Werner was only informed of the Proclamation of the German Empire on 18 January. The crown prince had impressed the design of the Palace of Versailles, which presented itself to visitors as a national site of fame in France, furnished with historical paintings. He wanted something similar for Berlin, but, unlike [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], he had not come to the idea that the imminent ceremony would be designed by the painter for posterity. Napoleon had allowed [[Jacques-Louis David]] to stage the furnishing and the appearance of the actors in his imperial crown for a historical painting.&lt;ref&gt;Zur Inszenierung Davids siehe [[Michael Sauer (Historiker)|Michael Sauer]]: ''Bilder im Geschichtsunterricht.'' Kallmeyer, Seelze-Velber 2000, {{ISBN|3-7800-4923-6}}, S. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Prussian ceremony in the [[Hall of Mirrors]] was short and simple. In the elongated gallery stood, on the window side, Prussian and Bavarian soldiers and on the mirror side, their officers, mixed with some other southern German armies. The King, accompanied by German princes and his entourage, crossed the trellis to the middle, where a field altar was erected. There, a Potsdam military spiritst celebrated a worship service, which the chorus had decided to sing "''Nun danket alle Gott"'' ([[Now Thank We All Our God]]). Then, the group went to a flat platform at the end of the gallery, where the princes and William stood in the middle. Bismarck, who stood below and was surrounded by commanders, read the imperial proclamation. Thereupon, the Grand Duke of Baden issued a "Hoch" ("Hurrah") to "His Majesty Emperor William", which those who were in attendance repeated three times. The ceremony was over, while the calls continued among the troops station in the palace and the park.&lt;ref&gt;Beschreibung der Zeremonie bei Gaethgens: ''Anton von Werner. Die Proklamierung'', S. 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the worship, Werner was able to quickly draw the main characters in the immediate vicinity. He later portrayed the princes, the representatives of the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities and numerous officers. During the work, an almost friendly relationship with the Crown Prince came about, as well as the personal relations to Federal Chancellor Bismarck and Emperor William.

Werner had the problem of representing the [[Trellis (architecture)|trellis]] that formed the soldies with the officers to the gallery and the princes grouped around them. The adjoining oil painting by Victor Bachereau-Reverchon (1842-1885) shows the comparatively narrow space, from whose end the flat gallery for the Emperor had already been removed. It was also important to take the picture of the ceiling paintings that glorify [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] as a conqueror of German lands and cities. As early as January 1871, a conceptual design followed, and later a model, which was approved by the Crown Prince.&lt;ref&gt;Dazu Gaethgens: ''Anton von Werner. Die Proklamierung'', S. 18, 22; Vorstudie in Öl, 78 × 158&amp;nbsp;cm, Privatbesitz in Sachsen, verschollen.&lt;/ref&gt;

The picture was commissioned for the [[Berlin Palace|Berlin city palace]]. Werner determined the image format according to a place he had chosen in the "White Hall", the largest of the château, which was used for public events such as the opening of the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag]] and the grand court. His visit was the end and highlight of the guided tours through the representative rooms of the castle, where several hundred paying visitors took part every day.&lt;ref&gt;E. Hennings: ''Das königliche Schloss in Berlin. Ein Führer durch seine Sehenswürdigkeiten.'' Selbstverlag des Verfassers, Berlin o. J. [um 1906], zum Bild und zur Bildergalerie (unten) S. 31, zu den Besucherzahlen S. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was against the window wall, opening the view to [[Unter den Linden]].&lt;ref&gt;Zum Umbau Goerd Peschken, Hans-Werner Klünner: ''Das Berliner Schloß. Das klassische Berlin. Unter Mitarbeit von Fritz-Eugen Keller und Thilo Eggeling.'' Propyläen, Berlin 1991, {{ISBN|3-549-06652-X}}, S. 490–492, zur Bilder- und Gobelingalerie (unten) S. 487 f.&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|William II]] had the hall redesigned in 1892, the picture only fitted into a 9.5 x 9.7m gap at the western end of the picture gallery, thus losing its effect. After the transformation of the picture gallery into a gobeling gallery by William II in 1914 and the following years of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the period of [[Nazi Germany|National Socialism]], the painting remained like most "parental pictures" of the castle, the eyes of the visitors. Werner's headquarters at the castle were burned during the [[World War II|Second World War]] on 2 February 1945, during an [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|air raid on Berlin]].

== Second painting, 1882 ==
The great popularity of the painting prompted William I to entrust Werner with the production of the imperial proclamation in the newly erected Hall of Famy of the Prussian Army in Berlin's [[Zeughaus]]. There, opposite to the entrance of the ''Ruler's Hall'', two wall paintings of Werner's flanked the figure of the victorious goddess Viktoria von [[Fritz Schaper]]. To the left was the coronation of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III]] as Prussian King, and on the right was the proclamation of William I as German Emperor in 1701 and 1871 respectively. The dome, painted by [[Friedrich Geselschap]] &lt;small&gt;([[:de:Friedrich Geselschap|de]])&lt;/small&gt;, arched above.

Werner designed a frontal display showing William on a high platform surrounded by German princes. At the lowest level, Bismarck, whom Werner had emphasised for colour composition with white uniforms, turned to him, Roon, Moltke and other German commanders. In the foreground, cheering officers to the right of the picture could be seen and to the left a larger group of simple soldiers. In the meantime, two allegorical figures held the Emperor's coat of arms. William rejected Werner's design as being unrealistic, especially since Roon had not taken part in the ceremony. He agreed, however, with Bismarck's uniform, which was also inaccurate. "You are right, he was wrongly dressed."&lt;ref&gt;Dazu Bartmann 1985, S.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the smaller width of the picture, Werner had to reduce the size of the painting considerably. Only the princes of seven larger states remained to the figures of William I, the Crown Prince, and the Grand Duke of Baden. Werner even further reduced the group of officers, placing [[Georg von Kameke]], who had now been appointed Minister of War, in the foreground while others came to the rear. The Prussian Army, with Bavaria, were now documented by a hand of the Prussian General [[Leonhard Graf von Blumenthal|Leonhard von Blumenthal]] with his Bavarian comrade [[Jakob von Hartmann]], emphasised by his high head of hair and light blue uniform.&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;In the reception of the second painting, it was often problematic that some features such as the now white uniform of Bismarck and his decoration of the [[Pour le Mérite]] do not correspond to the actual historical situation of 1871. Werner, however, deliberately portrayed the participants in the imperial proclamation according to the real circumstances of 1882, and thus a decade after the [[Founding of the German Empire|founding of the Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Dies wird nur selten zur Kenntnis genommen, wie in: [[Dietrich Grünewald]] (Hrsg.): ''Kunst entdecken.'' Cornelsen, Berlin 2009, S. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The figures were aged by a good ten years and had gained in importance at the same time. The emperor was now more than just a ''[[primus inter pares]]'', and Bismarck had received the Order. [[Thomas W. Gaehtgens]] thus assigned to this image the function that "it is not a description of history, but credentials of the present with the help of a past occurrence."&lt;ref&gt;Gaehtgens: ''Anton von Werner, die Proklamierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs; ein Historienbild im Wandel preußischer Politik.'' Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1990, S.&amp;nbsp;64.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Thus, according to William's view, the second painting emerged as a section of the first with a strong emphasis on figures of William before the princes and flags and Bismarck before the commanders and officers. Only a strict Cuirassier on the left in the foreground, represents the simple soldiers, namely Louis Stellmacher of [[Lychen]] of the [[Gardes du Corps (Prussia)|Gardes du Corps]] regiment (see picture).

The wall painting survived the air raids on the Zeughaus in November 1943, but was no longer in its frame after further damage to the building at the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe die Abbildungen der zerstörten Herrscherhalle bei Regina Müller: ''Das Berliner Zeughaus. Die Baugeschichte.'' Brandenburgisches Verlagshaus, Berlin 1994, {{ISBN|3-89488-055-4}}, S. 146 (Nr. 246, November 1943) und 256 (Nr. 253, 1945).&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Third painting, 1885 ==
[[File:Wernerprokla.jpg|thumb|Painting for Otto von Bismarck, handed over on 1 April 1885. Oil on canvas. 1.67 x 2.02m. Otto-von-Bismarck-Stiftung, Friedrichsruh]]
Werner's second painting, like the Hall of Fame, was also a great success. The [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern family]] asked Werner enthusiastically to paint another painting of the imperial proclamation to give it to the "Iron Chancellor" Bismarck for his 70th birthday in 1885. In the brevity of the time, Werner could only satisfy the wish by colouring the black and white model of the Zeughaus. Again the participants had grown older. At the end of March 1885, Werner used a visit to the Grand Duke of Baden in his studio to update his depiction of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gaehtgens: ''Anton von Werner, die Proklamierung des Deutschen Kaiserreichs; ein Historienbild im Wandel preußischer Politik.'' Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 1990, S.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception was [[Albrecht von Roon|Roon]], who had died in 1879 and was not present in 1871. William I had insisted on putting him in the painting because of his close relations to Bismarck. Werner painted Roon as if he would have been a participant at the proclamation. He had portrayed him several times on paintings on the Franco-Prussian War. Werner sacrificed Hartmann's hand print with Blumenthal for Roon's Square. Both moved so closely together that now Hartmann's turn to Blumenthal appears unmotivated.

== Fourth painting, 1913 ==
In 1913, Werner created a barely reproduced fourth painting of the Imperial Proclamation as a wall painting for the new building at the Realgymnasium School in [[Frankfurt (Oder)|Frankurt (Oder)]] (wax paints on canvas, 4.90 x 7.50m). The appearance of this painting was not passed on. In the Second World War it remained undamaged, but was lost after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;Bartmann: ''Anton von Werner. Zur Kunst und Kunstpolitik im Deutschen Kaiserreich'', S. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Recto and verso.svg|thumb|Left-to-right language books (for example in English)]]
[[File:Recto and verso RTL.svg|thumb|Right-to-left language books ([[Horizontal and vertical writing in East Asian scripts#Japanese and Traditional Chinese|vertical Japanese]], Arabic, or Hebrew)]]

The terms '''''recto''''' and '''''verso''''' refer, respectively, to the text written or printed on the "right" or "front" side and on the "back" side of a leaf of paper in a bound item such as a [[codex]], [[book]], [[broadsheet]], or [[pamphlet]]. 
The terms are shortened from Latin ''rectō foliō'' and ''versō foliō'', translating to  "on the right side of the leaf" and "on the back side of the leaf", respectively.
The two opposite pages themselves are called ''folium rectum'' and ''folium versum'' in Latin,&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. ''Quibus carminibus finitur totum primum folium versum (rectum vacat) voluminis'' "These poems finish the full back page (the front is blank) of the first leaf of the volume"
[Giovanni Battista Audiffredi], ''Catalogus historico-criticus Romanarum editionum saeculi XV'' (1783), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=lvwUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA225  p. 225].
&lt;/ref&gt; and the ablative ''recto'', ''verso'' already imply that the text on the page (and not the physical page itself) are referred to.

In [[codicology]], each physical sheet (''folium'', abbreviated ''fol.'' or ''f.'') of a manuscript is numbered and the sides are referred to as ''rectum'' and ''folium versum'', abbreviated as ''r'' and ''v'' respectively. Editions of manuscripts will thus mark the position of text in the original manuscript in the form  ''fol. 1r'', sometimes with the ''r'' and ''v'' in superscript, as in ''1&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;'', or with a superscript ''o'' indicating the [[Ordinal indicator#Latin|ablative]] ''recto'', ''verso'', as in ''1r&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;''.&lt;ref&gt; e.g.&lt;!--random recent examples of the practice, there are thousands to choose from, but it would be better to cite some kind of "introduction to codicology" instead--&gt; Roberts, ''Longinus on the Sublime: The Greek Text Edited After the Paris Manuscript'' (2011),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=U-JBqP0i2hcC&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 170]; Wijngaards, ''The Ordained Women Deacons of the Church's First Millennium'' (2012), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=qHKGVQbVEmIC&amp;pg=PA232#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 232]; etc. &lt;!--superscript r&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; apparently a French practice:, don't know about the ASCII "º" character (maybe Italian?)--&gt; Tylus, ''Manuscrits français de la collection berlinoise disponibles à la Bibliothèque Jagellonne de Cracovie (XVIe-XIXe siècles)'' (2010)[https://books.google.ch/books?id=v4TaJu_ErioC&amp;pg=PA274#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; This terminology has been standard since the beginnings of modern codicology in the 17th century.

Lyons (2011) argues that the term ''rectum'' "right, correct, proper" for the front side of the leaf derives from the use of [[papyrus]] in Late Antiquity, as a different grain ran across each side, and only one side was suitable to be written on, so that usually papyrus would carry writing only on the "correct", smooth side (and just in exceptional cases would there be writing on the reverse side of the leaf).&lt;ref&gt;Martyn Lyons (2011). ''Books A Living History''. Getty Publications. p. 21. {{ISBN|9781606060834}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--is this original speculation due to Lyons or does he have some kind of basis for that? I.e. is there any evidence of ''rectum'' used of a papyrus page in Late or Classical Latin? If so, it is not mentioned in Lewis &amp; Short.--&gt;

The terms "recto" and "verso" are also used in the codiology of manuscripts written in right-to-left scripts, like [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]]. However, as these scripts are written in the other direction to the scripts witnessed in European codices, the recto page is to the left while the verso is to the right. The reading order of each folio remains first verso, then recto regardless of writing direction.

The terms are carried over into printing; ''recto-verso''&lt;ref&gt;''Recto verso'' is an  expression in [[French language|French]] that means "two sides of a sheet or page". In Flanders the term recto verso is also used to indicate two-sided printing. Duplex printers are referred to as recto verso printers.&lt;/ref&gt; is the norm for printed books but was an important advantage of the [[printing press]] over the much older Asian [[woodblock printing]] method, which printed by rubbing from behind the page being printed, and so could only print on one side of a piece of paper. The distinction between recto and verso can be convenient in the [[annotation]] of scholarly books, particularly in [[bilingual edition]] translations.

The "recto" and "verso" terms can also be employed for the front and back of a one-sheet artwork, particularly in [[drawing]].  A recto-verso drawing is a sheet with drawings on both sides, for example in a sketchbook—although usually in these cases there is no obvious primary side.  Some works are planned to exploit being on two sides of the same piece of paper, but usually the works are not intended to be considered together.  Paper was relatively expensive in the past; indeed good drawing paper still is much more expensive than normal paper.

By book publishing convention, the first page of a book, and sometimes of each section and chapter of a book, is a recto page,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Drake |first=Paul |date=2007 |title=You Ought to Write All That Down |chapter=The Basic Elements and Order of a Book |publisher=Heritage Books |isbn=978-0-7884-0989-9 |pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and hence all recto pages will have odd numbers and all verso pages will have even numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilad |first=Suzanne |date=2007 |title=Copyediting &amp;amp; Proofreading For Dummies |publisher=For Dummies |isbn=9780470121719 |pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Merriam–Webster, Inc. |date=1998 |title=Merriam-Webster's Manual for Writers and Editors |publisher=Merriam–Webster |isbn=9780877796220 |pages=337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many early printed books or [[incunable|incunables]] and still in some 16th-century books (e.g. [[João de Barros]]'s ''Décadas da Ásia''), it is the folia ("leaves") rather than the pages, that are numbered. Thus each folium carries a consecutive number on its recto side, while on the verso side there is no number.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. a modern reprint of the 3rd ''Década'' (1563): ''Ásia de João de Barros: Dos feitos que os Portugueses fizeram no descobrimento e conquista dos mares e terras do Oriente. Tercera Década''. Imprensa Nacional – Casa da Moeda, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was also very common in ''e.g.'' internal company reports in the 20th century, before double-sided printers became commonplace in offices.

[[File:Revenge of the Goldfish.jpeg|thumb|300px|''Revenge of the Goldfish'', photograph of an installation by [[Sandy Skoglund]], 1981.]]
[[File:Revenge Of The Goldfish.jpg|thumb|200px|The photograph was used for the cover of the 1992 album ''[[Revenge of the Goldfish]]'' by the [[alternative rock]] band [[Inspiral Carpets]].]]
'''''Revenge of the Goldfish''''' is a photograph of an [[Installation art|installation]] completed in 1981 by contemporary artist [[Sandy Skoglund]]. The band [[Inspiral Carpets]] used the photograph for the cover of their 1992 album, also titled ''[[Revenge of the Goldfish]]''.

==Overview==
Like many of her other works, such as Radioactive Cats and Fox Games, the piece is a set composed of props and human models, which Skoglund poses and then photographs.&lt;ref name="Annenberg Learner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dreams and Visions: Revenge of the Goldfish|url=http://www.learner.org/courses/globalart/work/242/index.html|website=Annenberg Learner|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the piece, a child sits on the edge of a bed while an adult sleeps next to him. The set of the scene is a monochromatic blue, with contrasting bright orange [[goldfish]] floating through the room. The goldfish in the piece were sculpted by Skoglund out of [[terracotta]] and bring an element of fantasy to an otherwise normal scene.&lt;ref name="Annenberg Learner"/&gt; According to Skoglund, "If the fish are eliminated the image shows nothing unusual; just a room with two people in bed.”&lt;ref name="Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sandy Skoglund in Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/demetrio.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
The piece was first on display at the [[Saint Louis Art Museum]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish|url=http://www.slam.org/emuseum/code/emuseum.asp?style=Browse&amp;currentrecord=1&amp;quicksearch=Revenge%20of%20the%20Goldfish|publisher=[[Saint Louis Art Museum]]}} Accession Number: 1745:1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the piece has been in several collections at various museums, including [[Smith College Museum of Art]],&lt;ref name=smith1&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish (photograph)|url=http://museums.fivecolleges.edu/detail.php?museum=sc&amp;t=objects&amp;type=all&amp;f=&amp;s=Skoglund&amp;record=10|website=Collections Database|publisher=Five Colleges and Historic Deerfield Museum Consortium|accessdate=19 January 2015}} Accession Number: SC 1999:22-1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dallas Museum of Art]],&lt;ref name=dma&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish|url=https://www.dma.org/collection/artwork/sandy-skoglund/revenge-goldfish|publisher=[[Dallas Museum of Art]]|accessdate=19 January 2015}} Accession Number: 1981.32.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akron Art Museum]],&lt;ref name=akron&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish|url=http://akronartmuseum.org/collection/Obj1713?sid=308&amp;x=368122|publisher=[[Akron Art Museum]]|accessdate=19 January 2015}} Accession Number: 1982.1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish|url=http://www.cartermuseum.org/artworks/29268|publisher=[[Amon Carter Museum of American Art]]|accessdate=19 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith College Museum of Art also owns the original installation.&lt;ref name=smith2&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge of the Goldfish (installation)|url=http://museums.fivecolleges.edu/detail.php?museum=sc&amp;t=objects&amp;type=all&amp;f=&amp;s=Skoglund&amp;record=11|website=Collections Database|publisher=Five Colleges and Historic Deerfield Museum Consortium|accessdate=19 January 2015}} Accession Number:  	SC 1999:22-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Photography is as essential to Skoglund’s work as are the installations themselves because without photographs, the sets would eventually disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Interview with Sandy Skoglund|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/luca.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She visualizes the photograph after she has begun arranging the props so as not to “paralyze the process.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dreishpoon|first1=Douglas|title=An Interview with Sandy Skoglund|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/dreishspoon.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Skoglund believes that photography, combined with the installation, implies “...a realistic component and another, unreal one that, intruding on reality, interferes with it.”&lt;ref name="Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni"/&gt;  In photographing ''Revenge of the Goldfish'', Skoglund chooses an angle that makes the models’ identities ambiguous to the viewer.&lt;ref name="Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni"/&gt;  This ambiguity has elicited numerous arguments over the meaning of ''Revenge of the Goldfish''.&lt;ref name="Conversation with Demetrio Paparoni"/&gt;  Some interpret the image as a sexual awakening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barrett|first1=Terry|title=Sandy Skoglund's 'Revenge of the Goldfish''-Reply|url=http://www.getty.edu/education/teacherartexchange/archive/Feb96/0248.html|website=The Getty|accessdate=2014-10-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051139/http://www.getty.edu/education/teacherartexchange/archive/Feb96/0248.html|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while others see it as a message about homosexuality or child abuse.

==Inspiration==
Skoglund’s interest in filmmaking as an undergraduate, the death of her mother as a graduate student, and her move to [[New York City]] after graduate school, have all inspired her to create art in the way she does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Van Baron|first1=Judith|title=Essay by Judith Van Baron|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/scad.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Revenge of the Goldfish'', “[Skoglund] draws liberally from the conventions of [[science fiction]] and [[horror film]]s, and the display techniques of [[natural history]] museums and store windows.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heiferman|first1=Marvin|title=Serious Thoughts Are Popping UP|url=http://www.sandyskoglund.com/pages/published/pages_publish/marvin2.html|website=Sandy Skoglund|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Saints Christopher, Jerome and Louis of Toulouse''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Giovanni Bellini]], executed in 1513, and housed in the church of [[San Giovanni Crisostomo]], [[Venice]].

==History==
The painting dates to Bellini's late career, when he had adopted [[Giorgione]]'s tonalism. It had been commissioned in 1494 by the Venetian merchant   Giorgio Diletti. It is however signed and dated 1513, but it is not known why there were some twenty years between the commissioning and the execution.

==Description==
The layout is that of the [[Holy Conversation]] typical of the Venetian tradition, largely owed to works by  Bellini himself, with an arch opening to a landscape in the background, and three figures of saints. Instead of the usual throne with the Virgin, there is St. Jerome, portrayed as a hermit, on a rock, while reading the Bible. Below, separated by a parapet where is the cartouche with the signature, are St. Christopher and a Saint bishop.

The latter had been originally identified as St. Augustine based on text on the book  (''[[De civitate Dei]]''), which was later revealed to be apocryphal, as it is not placed on the front cover. Basing on the presence of lilies on the cloak, those of the [[Capetian House of Anjou|House of Anjou]], the character has been recognized as [[St. Louis of Toulouse]].

The saints were perhaps chosen depending from [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] themes, with St. Louis symbolizing the contemplative and liturgic life, and St. Christopher symbolizing preaching. According to this view, Jerome would thus be the highest point of spiritual life. The arch above him is a symbol of the Catholic church, and has a Greek inscription of the Psalm 14, referring to St. Jerome as the sage mentioned in it. The use of Greek derives from San Cristomo's role as church of the Greek-speaking Venetians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4172">{{Semiotics}}
'''Semiotic literary criticism''', also called '''literary semiotics''', is the approach to [[literary criticism]] informed by the theory of signs or [[semiotics]]. Semiotics, tied closely to the [[structuralism]] pioneered by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], was extremely influential in the development of [[literary theory]] out of the formalist approaches of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/S4B/sem11.html|title=Semiotics for Beginners: Criticisms|website=visual-memory.co.uk|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The early forms of literary semiotics grew out of formalist approaches to literature, especially [[Russian formalism]], and structuralist linguistics, especially the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague school]].  Notable early semiotic authors included [[Vladimir Propp]], [[Algirdas Julius Greimas]], and [[Viktor Shklovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ruc.udc.es/dspace/bitstream/handle/2183/13421/CC-130_art_129.pdf?sequence=1|title=Peirce’s Semiotics and the Russian Formalism: Points of Convergence|last=Kiryushchenko|first=Vitaly|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics were concerned with a formal analysis of narrative forms which would resemble a literary mathematics, or at least a literary [[syntax]], as far as possible.  They proposed various formal notations for narrative components and transformations and attempted a descriptive taxonomy of existing stories along these lines.

Propp's ''Morphology of the Folktale'' (orig. Russian pub. 1928; English trans. 1958) provides an example of the formal and systematic approach.  In successive chapters, Propp analyzes the characters, plot events, and other elements of traditional folktales (primarily from Russia and Eastern Europe).  For each of these key components he provides a letter designation (with superscripts to designate specific subtypes).  He proceeds to analyze individual tales by transposing them into this notation and then to generalize about their structure.  For example:

: Analysis of a simple, single-move tale of class H-I, of the type: kidnapping of a person.
:: 131. A tsar, three daughters (α).  The daughters go walking (β³), overstay in the garden (δ¹).  A dragon kidnaps them (A¹).  A call for aid (B¹).  Quest of three heroes (C↑).  Three battles with the dragon (H¹–I¹), rescue of the maidens (K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;).  Return (↓), reward (w°). (Propp 128)

He then gives the complete structure of this story in one line of notation, the analysis complete and ready to be compared systematically with other tales:

::: αβ³δ¹A¹B¹C↑H¹–I¹K&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;↓w°

Later semiotic approaches to literature have often been less systematic (or, in some special cases such as [[Roland Barthes]]'s ''[[S/Z]]'', they have been so specifically and exhaustively systematic as to render the possibility of a complete literary semiotics doubtful).  As structuralist linguistics gave way to a [[post-structuralist]] philosophy of language which denied the scientific ambitions of the general theory of signs, semiotic literary criticism became more playful and less systematic in its ambitions.  Still, some authors harbor more scientific ambition for their literary schemata than others.  Later authors in the semiotic tradition of literary criticism include [[Tzvetan Todorov]], [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michael Riffaterre]], and [[Umberto Eco]].

The '''Spectrum Awards''' were established in 1994 by Cathy Fenner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?10622|title = Cathy Fenner - Summary Bibliography|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arnie Fenner&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/ea.cgi?10621|title = Arnie Fenner - Summary Bibliography|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; to recognize the best in fantasy, science fiction, and horror artwork created each year.

In 1993, they announced a call for entries to the arts community to submit work. Beginning in 1994, works selected by jury have been compiled in the anthology, '''''Spectrum – The Best in Contemporary Fantastic Art''''', published annually by Underwood Books. The jury selects two award winners (Gold and Silver) in each category while the Spectrum Fantastic Art advisory board selects the recipient of the Grand Master award.

Spectrum Award winners receive an award statue and a full page showcasing their award winning artwork in the anthology. Starting with Spectrum 21, the artist also receives an additional full page dedicated to them. The second page includes a photograph of the artist, an excerpt from their award acceptance speech and a short biography.

Spectrum is open to every artist who wishes to participate and can adhere to the competition's rules: international entrants are welcome. Students, fine artists, and illustrators are all treated equally. There are no limits on the number of pieces an artist can submit and there is no pre-screening prior to judging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://spectrumfantasticart.com/about.php|title = Spectrum, About Us|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Arnie and Cathy Fenner, who for twenty years had spearheaded the ongoing ''Spectrum'' annual publications, announced at the second '''Spectrum Fantastic Art Live''' event in May 2013 the transition of the book to a new director, editor and publisher. Beginning with ''Spectrum'' 21, John Fleskes of Flesk Publications will assume those responsibilities.

{{about|the literary device|the prewriting technique|Free writing}}

In [[literary criticism]], '''stream of consciousness''' is a [[narrative mode]] or method that attempts to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (Harmondsworth, Penguin Books,1984), pp. 660-1).&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[William James]] in 1890 in his ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'', and in 1918 the novelist [[May Sinclair]] (1863–1946) first applied the term stream of consciousness, in a literary context, when discussing [[Dorothy Richardson]]'s (1873–1957) novels. ''[[Pointed Roofs]]'' (1915), the first work in Richardson's [[novel sequence|series]] of 13 semi-autobiographical novels titled ''[[Pilgrimage (novel sequence)|Pilgrimage]]'',&lt;ref name="Winning2000"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MEz_3E-SnA0C|title=The Pilgrimage of Dorothy Richardson|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-299-17034-9|author=Joanne Winning}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first complete stream of consciousness novel published in English. However, in 1934, Richardson comments that "[[Proust]], [[James Joyce]], [[Virginia Woolf]] &amp; D.R. ... were all using 'the new method', though very differently, simultaneously".&lt;ref&gt;In a letter to the bookseller and publisher [[Sylvia Beach]] ''Windows of Modernism: Selected Letters of Dorothy Richardson, ed. Gloria G. Fromm Athens, Georgia, University of Georgia Press, 1995, 282.&lt;/ref&gt; There were, however, many earlier precursors and the technique is still used by contemporary writers.

==Definition==
Stream of consciousness is a [[narrative device]] that attempts to give the written equivalent of the character's [[thought process]]es, either in a loose interior monologue (see below), or in connection to his or her actions.  Stream of consciousness writing is usually regarded as a special form of interior monologue and is characterized by associative leaps in thought and lack of some or all punctuation.&lt;ref&gt;For example, both [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]] and [[James Joyce|Joyce]] omitted full stops and paragraph breaks, but while Joyce also omitted apostrophes, Beckett left them in.&lt;/ref&gt; Stream of consciousness and interior monologue are distinguished from [[dramatic monologue]] and [[soliloquy]], where the speaker is addressing an audience or a third person, which are chiefly used in [[poetry]] or [[drama]]. In stream of consciousness the speaker's thought processes are more often depicted as overheard in the mind (or addressed to oneself); it is primarily a [[fictional device]].
The term "stream of consciousness" was coined by [[philosopher]] and [[psychologist]] [[William James]] in  ''[[The Principles of Psychology]]'' (1890):
{{quote|consciousness, then, does not appear to itself as chopped up in bits ... it is nothing joined; it flows. A 'river' or a 'stream' are the metaphors by which it is most naturally described. {{em|In talking of it hereafter, let's call it the stream of thought, consciousness, or subjective life.}}&lt;ref&gt;(I, pp.239-43) quoted in Randall Stevenson, ''Modernist Fiction: An Introduction''. (Lexington, Kentucky: University of Kentucky, 1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:UlyssesCover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (first edition, 1922), considered a prime example of stream of consciousness writing styles.]]
In the following example of stream of consciousness from James Joyce's ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'', Molly seeks sleep:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
a quarter after what an unearthly hour I suppose theyre just getting up in China now combing out their pigtails for the day well soon have the nuns ringing the angelus theyve nobody coming in to spoil their sleep except an odd priest or two for his night office the alarmlock next door at cockshout clattering the brains out of itself let me see if I can doze off 1 2 3 4 5 what kind of flowers are those they invented like the stars the wallpaper in Lombard street was much nicer the apron he gave me was like that something only I only wore it twice better lower this lamp and try again so that I can get up early &lt;ref&gt;Joyce p. 642 (Bodley Head edition (1960), p. 930).&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Interior monologue==
{{See also|Internal monologue}}

While many sources use the terms stream of consciousness and interior monologue as synonyms, the ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'' suggests, that "they can also be distinguished psychologically and literarily. In a psychological sense, stream of consciousness is the subject‐matter, while interior monologue is the technique for presenting it". And for literature, "while an interior monologue always presents a character's thoughts 'directly', without the apparent intervention of a summarizing and selecting narrator, it does not necessarily mingle them with impressions and perceptions, nor does it necessarily violate the norms of grammar, or logic- but the stream‐of‐consciousness technique also does one or both of these things."&lt;ref&gt;ed. Chris Baldick, Oxford: Oxford U.P.,  2009, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly the ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'', while agreeing that these terms are "often used interchangeably", suggests, that "while an interior monologue may mirror all the half thoughts, impressions, and associations that impinge upon the character's consciousness, it may also be restricted to an organized presentation of that character's rational thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/290310/interior-monologue "interior monologue." ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 24 Sep. 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

===Beginnings to 1900===
While the use of the narrative technique of stream of consciousness is usually associated with modernist novelists in the first part of the twentieth-century, a number of precursors have been suggested, including [[Laurence Sterne]]'s [[psychological novel]] ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' (1757).&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''A Dictionary of Literary Terms''. (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1984), p. 661; see also Robert Humphrey, ''Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel'' (1954). University of California Press, 1972, fn. 13, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested that [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s short story "[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]" (1843) foreshadows this literary technique in the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1785800/The-Tell-Tale-Heart|title=The Tell-Tale Heart - story by Poe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe's story is a [[first person narrative]], told by an unnamed narrator who endeavors to convince the reader of his sanity, while describing a murder he committed. and it is often read as a [[dramatic monologue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eapoe.org/index.htm|title=Edgar Allan Poe Society of Baltimore - The Life and Writings of Edgar Allan Poe|website=www.eapoe.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; George R. Clay notes that [[Leo Tolstoy]] "when the occasion requires it ... applies Modernist stream of consciousness technique" in both ''[[War and Peace]]'' (1869) and ''[[Anna Karenina]]'' (1878).&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy'', edited Donna Tussing Orwin. Cambridge University Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;
The short story "[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]" (1890) by another American author, [[Ambrose Bierce]], also  abandons strict linear time to record the internal consciousness of the protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Khanom, Afruza. "Silence as Literary Device in Ambrose Bierce's 'The Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge.' ''Teaching American Literature: A Journal of Theory and Practice.'' Spring 6.1 (2013): 45-52. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his renunciation of chronology in favor of free association, [[Édouard Dujardin]]'s ''[[Les Lauriers sont coupés]]'' (1887) is also an important precursor. Indeed, [[James Joyce]] "picked up a copy of Dujardin's novel ... in Paris in 1903" and "acknowledged a certain borrowing from it".&lt;ref&gt;Randell StevensonJ ''Modernist Fiction''. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992, p. 227, fn 14.&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also those who point to [[Anton Chekhov]]'s short stories and plays (1881-1904)&lt;ref&gt;James Wood, "Ramblings". ''London Review of Books''. Vol.22, no. 11, 1 June 2000, pp. 36-7.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Knut Hamsun]]'s ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]'' (1890), and ''[[Mysteries (novel)|Mysteries]]'' (1892) as offering glimpses of the use of stream of consciousness as a narrative technique at the end of the nineteenth-century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n23/wood02_.html James Wood. "Addicted to Unpredictability." November 26, 1998. ''London Review of Books''. November 8, 2008 ]&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Hunger'' is widely seen as a classic of world literature and a groundbreaking modernist novel, ''Mysteries'' is also considered a pioneer work. It has been claimed that Hamsun was way ahead of his time with the use of stream of consciousness in two chapters in particular of this novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamsunsenteret.no/en/component/author/page/107-hamsun's-modernism|title=Martin Humpál: Hamsun’s modernism - Hamsunsenteret - Hamsunsenteret|website=hamsunsenteret.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;[https://tv.nrk.no/serie/guddommelig-galskap-knut-hamsun/PRTR64006207/13-12-2009#t=19m59s Interview with Robert Ferguson in the second episode of the documentary television series ''Guddommelig galskap - Knut Hamsun'' ]&lt;/ref&gt; British author Robert Ferguson said: “There’s a lot of dreamlike aspects of ''Mysteries''. In that book ... it is ... two chapters, where he actually invents stream of consciousness writing, in the early 1890s. This was long before Dorothy Richardson, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce.” &lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt; [[Henry James]] has also been suggested as a significant precursor, in a work as early as ''[[Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1881).&lt;ref&gt;M. H. Abrams, ''A Glossary of Literary Terms''. New York: Harcourt Brace, 1999), p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that he influenced later stream of consciousness writers, including [[Virginia Woolf]], who not only read some of his novels but also wrote essays about them.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf (March 2003)''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pn9OzR4AYdsC&amp;pg=PA40 A Writer's Diary: Being Extracts from the Diary of Virginia Woolf]''. Harcourt.  pp. 33, 39–40, 58, 86, 215, 301, 351.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has also been argued that [[Arthur Schnitzler]] (1862-1931), in his short story '"Leutnant Gustl" ("None but the Brave", 1900), was in fact the first to make full use of the stream of consciousness technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/133295/stream-of-consciousness|title=stream of consciousness - literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Twentieth century===
But it is only in the twentieth-century that this technique is fully developed by modernists. [[Marcel Proust]] is often presented as an early example of a writer using the stream of consciousness technique in his novel sequence ''[[À la recherche du temps perdu]]'' (1913–1927) (''In Search of Lost Time''), but Robert Humphrey comments, that Proust "is concerned only with the reminiscent aspect of consciousness" and, that he "was deliberately recapturing the past for the purpose of communicating; hence he did not write a stream-of consciousness novel".&lt;ref&gt;''Stream of Consciousness in the Modern Novel'' (Berkeley &amp; Los Angeles: University of California, 1954), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[John Cowper Powys]] also argues that Proust did not use stream of consciousness: "while we are told what the hero thinks or what Swann thinks we are told this rather by the author than either by the 'I' of the story or by Charles Swann."&lt;ref&gt;"Proust".

Let us go then, you and I,
 When the evening is spread out against the sky
 Like a patient etherized upon a table;
 Let us go, through certain half-deserted streets,
 The muttering retreats
 Of restless nights in one-night cheap hotels
 And sawdust restaurants with oyster-shells:
 Streets that follow like a tedious argument
 Of insidious intent
 To lead you to an overwhelming question ...
 Oh, do not ask, "What is it?"
 Let us go and make our visit.

 In the room the women come and go
 Talking of Michelangelo.
&lt;/poem&gt;|source =T. S. Eliot, "The Lovesong of J. Alfred Prufrock"&lt;br /&gt;1915}}

The term was first applied in a literary context in ''The Egoist'', April 1918, by [[May Sinclair]], in relation to the early volumes of [[Dorothy Richardson]]'s [[novel sequence]] ''Pilgrimage''. Richardson, however,  describes the term as an 'lamentably ill-chosen metaphor".&lt;ref&gt;"Novels", ''Life and Letters'', 56, March 1948, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Joyce]] was a major pioneer in the use of stream of consciousness. Some hints of this technique, are already present in ''[[A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man]]'' (1916), along with [[interior monologue]], and references to a character's psychic reality rather than to his external surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Deming, p. 749.&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce began writing ''A Portrait'' in  1907 and it was first serialised in the English literary magazine ''[[The Egoist]]'' in 1914 and 1915. Earlier in 1906 Joyce, when working on ''Dubliners'', considered adding another story featuring a Jewish advertising canvasser called [[Leopold Bloom]] under the title ''Ulysses''. Although he did not pursue the idea further at the time, he eventually commenced work on a novel using both the title and basic premise in 1914. The writing was completed in October 1921. Serial publication of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' in the magazine ''[[The Little Review]]'' began in March 1918. ''Ulysses'' was finally published in 1922. While ''Ulysses'' represents a major example of the use of stream of consciousness Joyce also uses "authorial description" and Free Indirect Style to register Bloom's inner thoughts. Furthermore the novel does not focus solely on  interior experiences: "Bloom  is constantly shown ''from'' all round; from inside as well as out; from a variety of points of view which range from the objective to the subjective".&lt;ref&gt;Randell Stevenson. ''A Reader's Guidw to the Twentieth-Century Novel in Britain''. University of Kentucky Press, 1993, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; In his final work ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' (1939) Joyce's method of stream of consciousness, literary allusions and free dream associations was pushed to the limit in, which abandoned all conventions of plot and character construction and is written in a peculiar and obscure English, based mainly on complex multi-level puns.

Another early example is the use of [[interior monologue]] by [[T. S. Eliot]] in his poem "[[The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock]]" (1915), a [[dramatic monologue]] of an urban man, stricken with feelings of isolation and an incapability for decisive action,"&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Kathleen, and Harlan, Judith. ''English Literature From 1785'' (New York: HarperCollins, 1992), 265–66. {{ISBN|006467150X}}&lt;/ref&gt; a work probably influenced by the narrative poetry of [[Robert Browning]], including "[[Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister]]".&lt;ref&gt;William Harmon &amp; C. Holman, ''A Handbook to Literature'' (7th edition). (Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 1996), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1923 to 2000===

Prominent uses in the years that followed the publication of James Joyce's ''Ulysses'', include [[Italo Svevo]], ''[[Zeno's Conscience|La coscienza di Zeno]]'' (1923),&lt;ref&gt;[untitled review], [https://www.jstor.org/stable/478649 Beno Weiss, ''Italica'', Vol. 67, No. 3 (Autumn, 1990), p. 395.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Virginia Woolf]], ''[[Mrs Dalloway]]'' (1925), ''[[To the Lighthouse]]'' (1927), and [[William Faulkner]] in ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Randell Stevenson suggests, that "interior monologue, rather than stream of consciousness, is the appropriate term for the style in which [subjective experience] is recorded, both in ''[[The Waves]]'' and in Woolf's writing generally.&lt;ref&gt;''Modernist Fiction''. Lexington: University of Kentucky, 1992, p. 55; ''Oxford Dictionary of Literary Terms'', p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout ''Mrs Dalloway'' Woolf blurs the distinction between [[Direct speech|direct]] and [[indirect speech]], freely alternating her [[Narrative mode|mode of narration]] between [[Third-person omniscient|omniscient description]], [[free indirect discourse|indirect]] [[interior monologue]], and [[soliloquy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dowling |first=David |title=Mrs Dalloway: Mapping Streams of Consciousness |page=46 |year=1991 |publisher=Twayne Publishers |isbn=978-0-8057-9414-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malcolm Lowry]]'s novel ''[[Under the Volcano]]'' (1947) resembles ''Ulysses'', "both in its concentration almost entirely within a single day of [Its protagonist] Firmin's life ... and in the range of interior monologues and stream of consciousness employed to represent the minds of [the] characters".&lt;ref&gt;Randall Stevenson, pp. 89-90.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Beckett]], a friend of James Joyce, uses interior monologue in novels like [[Molloy (novel)|''Molloy'']] (1951), ''Malone meurt'' (1951; ''[[Malone Dies]]'') and ''L'innommable'' (1953: ''[[the Unnamable (novel)|The Unnamable]]''). and the short story "[[From an Abandoned Work]]" (1957).&lt;ref&gt;Karine Germoni, '"From Joyce to Beckett: The Beckettian Dramatic Interior Monologue'". ''Journal of Beckett Studies'', Spring 2004, Vol. 13, issue 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique continued to be used into the 1970s in a novel such as [[Robert Anton Wilson]]/[[Robert Shea]] collaborative ''[[Illuminatus!]]'' (1975),  with regard to which ''[[The Fortean Times]]'' warns readers, to "[b]e prepared for streams of consciousness in which not only identity but time and space no longer confine the narrative".&lt;ref&gt;''The Fortean Times'', issue 17 (August 1976), pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish writer [[James Kelman]]'s novels are known for mixing stream of consciousness narrative with [[Glasgow|Glaswegian]] vernacular. Examples include ''[[The Busconductor Hines]]'', ''[[A Disaffection]]'' and ''[[How Late It Was, How Late]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/minds-are-the-strangest-thing Giles Harvey, "Minds Are The Strangest Thing". ''The New Yorker'', May 20, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to [[Salman Rushdie]] one critic comments, that "[a]ll Rushdie's novels follow an Indian/Islamic storytelling style, a stream-of-consciousness narrative told by a loquacious young Indian man".&lt;ref&gt;John C. Hawley, ''Encyclopedia Of Postcolonial Studies'' (Westport: Greenwood, 2001), p. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers who use this narrative device include [[Sylvia Plath]] in ''[[The Bell Jar]]'' (1963)&lt;ref&gt;''American Literature'', Vol. 65, No. 2, Jun. 1993, 
p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Irvine Welsh]] in ''[[Trainspotting (novel)|Trainspotting]]'' (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Keating, "Tales from the Other Side of the Track". ''Irish Times'' 3 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stream of consciousness continues to appear in contemporary literature. [[Dave Eggers]], author of ''[[A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius]]'' (2000), according to one reviewer, "talks much as he writes – a forceful stream of consciousness, thoughts sprouting in all directions".&lt;ref&gt;"The agony and the irony", Stephanie Merritt. ''The Observer'', Sunday 14 May 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist John Banville describes [[Roberto Bolaño]]'s novel ''[[Amulet (novel)|Amulet]]'' (1999), as written in "a fevered stream of consciousness".&lt;ref&gt;"Amulet by Roberto Bolaño", John Banville. ''The Guardian'', Saturday 12 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twenty-first century=== 
The twenty-first century brought further exploration, including [[Jonathan Safran Foer]]'s ''[[Everything is Illuminated]]'' (2002) and many of the short stories of American author [[Brendan Connell]].&lt;ref&gt;"A nine-year-old and 9/11", Tim Adams

'''''Sueño de una tarde dominical en la Alameda Central''''' or '''''Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the [[Mexico City Alameda Central|Alameda Central]]''''' is a [[mural]] created by [[Diego Rivera]]. It was painted between the years 1946 and 1947, and is the principal work of the [[Museo Mural Diego Rivera]] adjacent to the Alameda in the [[Historic center of Mexico City|historic center]] of [[Mexico City]].

==History==

The mural was originally created at the request of architect [[Carlos Obregón Santacilia]] for the Versailles
Restaurant of the Hotel Del Prado, which was located across the street. When the hotel was rendered uninhabitable in the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] and condemned for demolition, the mural was restored and moved to its own museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museomuraldiegorivera.bellasartes.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=240&amp;Itemid=118 Hotel del Prado]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

The mural depicts famous people and events in the [[history of Mexico]], passing through the [[Mexico City Alameda Central|Alameda Central]] park in Mexico City. Some notable figures include [[Frida Kahlo]], [[José Guadalupe Posada]],  [[Francisco I. Madero]], [[Benito Juárez]], [[Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz]], [[Porfirio Díaz]], [[Agustín de Iturbide]], [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], [[Maximilian I of Mexico]],  [[Juan de Zumárraga]], [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]], [[Winfield Scott]], [[Victoriano Huerta]], [[José Martí]], [[Manuel Gutiérrez Nájera]], [[Hernán Cortés]], [[Nicolás Zúñiga y Miranda]], and [[La Malinche]].

The central focus of the mural is on a display of bourgeois complacency and values shortly before the [[Mexican Revolution of 1910]]. Elegantly dressed upper-class figures promenade under the figure of the long ruling dictator Porfirio Díaz. An indigenous family is forced back by police batons and to the right flames and violence loom. To the far left, victims of the Inquisition, wearing the penitential sanbenito robes and the conical coroza hat, are consigned to the flames at an auto-da-fé. The center of the mural is dominated by the elegantly dressed skeleton [[La Calavera Catrina]] holding arms with the Mexican graphic artist who first conceived and drew her, [[José Guadalupe Posada]] in a black suit and cane. La Catrina wears a [[Feathered Serpent]] boa around her shoulders. On [[La Calavera Catrina|La Catrina's]] right she is holding hands with a child version of [[Diego Rivera]] in short pants. Rivera's wife [[Frida Kahlo]] is standing just behind and between him and La Catrina; Kahlo has her hand on Rivera's shoulder and she is holding a [[yin-yang]] device. [[La Malinche]] and [[José Guadalupe Posada|Posada]] are staring directly into each other's eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museomuraldiegorivera.bellasartes.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=239&amp;Itemid=117 Dream of a Sunday afternoon] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616182940/http://www.museomuraldiegorivera.bellasartes.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=239&amp;Itemid=117 |date=2013-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tales of the Dervishes''''' was first published in 1967, and recently re-published by The Idries Shah Foundation in October 2016.  Together with ''The Exploits of Mulla Nasrudin'', 
published the year before, it represented the first of several books of practical Sufi instructional materials 
to be released by [[Idries Shah]]. Like all releases on this new ISF Publishing era, this book (and its audiobook) is offered online, for free, on the official [http://www.idriesshahfoundation.org/books/tales-of-the-dervishes-teaching-stories-over-a-thousand-years/ Idries Shah Foundation site]. 

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''Tales of the Dervishes'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Summary==
''Tales of the Dervishes'' is a collection of stories, parables, legends and fables gathered from
classical Sufi texts and oral sources spanning a period from the 7th to the 20th centuries.
It introduced a 'genre' – the [[Teaching stories|teaching story]] – to a contemporary readership familiar with the
entertainment or moralistic values of such tales but unfamiliar with certain instrumental functions 
claimed for them. An author's postscript to each story offers a brief account of its provenance, 
use and place in Sufi tradition.

==Reception==
The [[Islamic scholar]] [[James Kritzeck]], reviewing Shah's ''Tales of the Dervishes'' in ''[[The Nation]]'', said that it was "beautifully translated" and equipped "men and women to make good use of their lives."&lt;ref name="DLES"&gt;{{cite news

Ornstein]], writing in ''[[Psychology Today]]'', called the book "... a collection of diamonds ... incredibly well-crafted, multifaceted ... likely to endure in the manner of the Koran and the Bible."&lt;ref name=Reviews&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Tales-Dervishes-Idries-Shah/dp/0140193588 ''Tales of the Dervishes'': Editorial Reviews] on ''[[amazon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Observer]]'' noted that the book "... challenges our intellectual assumptions at almost every point."&lt;ref name=Reviews /&gt; [[Desmond Morris]], in ''The World of Books'' (''[[BBC]]''), said that "For every decade we live, we will find another meaning in each story."&lt;ref name=Reviews /&gt; The ''[[Sunday Times]]'' called it "An astonishingly generous and liberating book ... strikingly appropriate for our time and situation ... a jewel flung in the market-place."&lt;ref name=Reviews /&gt;

Noted psychiatrist and author Arthur Deikman, in his book "The Observing Self", uses tales from this work to illustrate the role of intuition in the human makeup and the idea that mysticism is an extension of natural psychological faculties.&lt;ref name=&gt;{{cite book

Philosopher of [[science]] and physicist [[Henri Bortoft]] used teaching tales from Shah's corpus as analogies of the habits of mind which prevented people from grasping the scientific method of [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]]. Bortoft's ''[[The Wholeness of Nature: Goethe's Way of Science]]'' includes stories from ''Tales of the Dervishes'', ''[[The Exploits of the Incomparable Mullah Nasruddin]]'' and ''[[A Perfumed Scorpion]]''.

'''''The Trinity and Mystic Pietà''''' is an [[Oil painting|oil on oak]] painting undertaken in 1512 by the German artist [[Hans Baldung]].&lt;ref name="NG: Key Facts" /&gt;

==Painting==
The painting shows God supporting his son, with the [[Holy Spirit]] above them, represented by a dove; the [[holy trinity]] are joined by the weeping figures of [[John the Apostle|St. John]] and the [[Virgin Mary]].&lt;ref name="NG: Details" /&gt; The inclusion of God supporting his crucified son within the picture was popular during the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, but is otherwise rare in art history.{{sfn|Herbert McAvoy|2008|p=50}} Beneath the holy figures are a series of smaller individuals, who are assumed by art historians to be the family who commissioned the painting; this is likely to be the Bettschold and [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] families, given the coats of arms present in the lower corners. The donors were often depicted during the Middle Ages as much smaller than the holy figures, in order to emphasise the difference between them.{{sfn|Dunkerton|Foister|Penny|2002|p=13}}

The painting was acquired in 1894 by the [[National Gallery]], London, who still hold the piece as at 2015.&lt;ref name="NG: Key Facts" /&gt; The gallery consider that "Baldung's painting invites our imaginative participation by stressing the human emotions of the mourners, and presenting even God the Father simply as a grieving parent."&lt;ref name="NG: Details" /&gt;

'''''The Wedding Feast at Cana''''' (1563), by the Italian artist [[Paolo Veronese]] (1528–88), is a [[representation (arts)|representational painting]] that depicts the biblical story of the [[Marriage at Cana]], at which [[Jesus]] converts water to wine (John 2:1–11). Executed in the [[Mannerism|Mannerist style]] (1520–1600) of the late Renaissance, the large-format (6.77m × 9.94m) [[oil painting]] comprehends the [[style (visual arts)|stylistic]] ideal of compositional harmony, as practised by the artists  [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo]], [[Raphael]], and [[Michelangelo]].&lt;ref&gt;''Penguin Dictionary of Art and Artists'' (1997) Seventh Edition, Peter Murray, Linda Murray, Eds. p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of the [[High Renaissance]]  (1490–1527) emphasized human figures of ideal proportions, balanced composition, and beauty, whereas Mannerism exaggerated the Renaissance ideals — of figure, light, and colour — with asymmetric and unnaturally elegant arrangements achieved by flattening the pictorial space and distorting the human figure as an ideal preconception of the subject, rather than as a realistic representation.&lt;ref&gt;''Penguin Dictionary of Art and Artists'' (1997) Seventh Edition, Peter Murray and Linda Murray, Eds. p. 469.&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual tension among the elements of the picture and the thematic instability among the human figures in ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' derive from Veronese's application of technical artifice, the inclusion of sophisticated cultural codes and symbolism (social, religious, theologic), which present a biblical story relevant to the Renaissance viewer and to the contemporary viewer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/zino/hd_zino.htm |title= ''Mannerism: Bronzino (1503–1572) and his Contemporaries'' |author= Finocchio, Ross. |publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art |date= |accessdate= 2013-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pictorial area (67.29 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of the canvas makes ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' the most expansive picture in the paintings collection of the [[Musée du Louvre]].

==History==
===The commission===
[[File:Basilica di San Giorgio Maggiore (Venice).jpg|thumb|right|350px|In 1562, the Benedictine monks commissioned Paolo Veronese to realise ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' as a monumental painting (6.77m × 9.94m) to occupy the back wall of the monastery's refectory, at the Basilica di San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice.]]

At Venice, on 6 June 1562, the Black Monks of the [[Order of Saint Benedict]] (OSB) commissioned the painter Paolo Veronese to realise a monumental painting (6.77m×9.94m) to decorate the far wall of the monastery's new [[refectory]], designed by the architect [[Andrea Palladio]], at the [[Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore]], on the [[San Giorgio Maggiore|eponymous island]]. In their business contract for the commission of ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'', the Benedictine monks stipulated that Veronese be paid 324 [[ducat]]s; be paid the costs of his personal and domestic maintenance; be provided a [[barrel]] of wine; and be fed in the refectory. &lt;ref name="d.macdonald"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldsbestpaintings.net/artistsandpaintings/painting/6/ |author= MacDonald, Deanna |title= ''Paolo Veronese: The Wedding Feast at Cana — 1562–3'' |publisher= Great Works of Western Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetically, the Benedictine contract stipulated that the painter represent “the history of the banquet of Christ’s miracle at Cana, in Galilee, creating the number of [human] figures that can be fully accommodated.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://ivc.lib.rochester.edu/the-language-of-the-banquet-reconsidering-paolo-veroneses-wedding-at-cana/ |author= Hanson, Kate. |title= “The Language of the Banquet: Reconsidering Paolo Veronese’s ''Wedding at Cana''” (2010) |publisher= ''Invisible Culture'', Issue 14: Aesthetes and Eaters – Food and the Arts (Winter 2010) p. 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That Veronese use ''optimi colori'' (optimum colours) — specifically, the colour [[ultramarine]], a deep-blue pigment made from [[lapis lazuli]], a semi-precious, [[metamorphic rock]].&lt;ref&gt; Cicogna, Emmanuelle Antonio, ''Delle Inscrizioni Veneziane'' (1824), Vol. IV, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted by his brother, Benedetto Caliari, Veronese delivered the completed painting in September 1563, in time for the ''Festa della Madonna della Salute'', in November.&lt;ref name="d.macdonald"/&gt;

===Composition and technique===
In the 17th century, during the mid–1630s, supporters of [[Andrea Sacchi]] (1599–1661) and supporters of [[Pietro da Cortona]] (1596–1669) argued much about the ideal number of human figures for a [[Representation (arts)|representational composition]].&lt;ref name="Wittkower"&gt;Wittkower, Rudolf. ''The Art and Architecture of Italy: 1600–1750'' (1993) pp. 261–266.&lt;/ref&gt; Sacchi said that only a few figures (fewer than twelve) permit the artist to honestly depict the unique body poses and facial expressions that communicate character; while da Cortona said that many human figures consolidate the general image of a painting into an epic subject from which sub-themes would develop.&lt;ref name="Wittkower" /&gt;

In the 18th century, in ''Seven Discourses on Art'' (1769–90), the portraitist [[Joshua Reynolds]] (1723–92), said that:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The subjects of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian painters]] are mostly such as gave them an opportunity of introducing a great number of figures, such as feasts, marriages, and processions, public martyrdoms, or miracles. I can easily conceive that [Paolo] Veronese, if he were asked, would say that no subject was proper for an historical picture, but such as admitted at least forty figures; for in a less number, he would assert, there could be no opportunity of the painter's showing his art in composition, his dexterity of managing and disposing the masses of light, and groups of figures, and of introducing a variety of [[Orientalism|Eastern]] dresses and characters in their rich stuffs.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Joshua. ''Seven Discourses on Art'' (1769–90), pp. 31–32.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
As a narrative painting in the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] style, ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' combines stylistic and pictorial elements from the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]]'s philosophy of ''colorito'' (priority of colour) of [[Titian]] (1488–1576) to the compositional ''[[disegno]]'' (drawing) of the [[High Renaissance]] (1490–1527) used in the works of [[Leonardo Da Vinci|Leonardo]] (1452–1519), [[Raphael]] (1483–1520), and [[Michelangelo]] (1475–1564).&lt;ref name="Analysis"&gt;''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' (1562–3), Paolo Veronese: Analysis. Art Encyclopedia. p. 2. http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/wedding-feast-at-cana.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Veronese's depiction of the crowded banquet-scene that is ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' is meant to be viewed upwards, from below — because the painting's bottom-edge was 2.50 metres from the refectory floor, behind and above the head-table seat of the [[abbot]] of the monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Hanson, Kate. "The Language of the Banquet: Reconsidering Paolo Veronese's ''The Wedding at Cana''" (2010) ''InVisible Culture: An Electronic Journal of Visual Culture'', Issue 14: Aesthetes and Eaters — Food and the Arts (Winter 2010), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

As stipulated in the Benedictine contract for the painting, the canvas of monumental dimensions (6.77m x 9.94m) and area (67.29m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) was to occupy the entire display-wall in the refectory. In the 16th century, Palladio's great-scale design was [[Classical architecture|Classically]] austere; the monastery dining-room featured a [[Vestibule (architecture)|vestibule]] with a large door, and then stairs that led to a narrow [[Antechamber|ante-chamber]], where the entry door to the refectory was flanked with two marble ''[[Lavabo|lavabos]]'', for diners to cleanse themselves;&lt;ref&gt;Lauritzen, Peter. "The Architectural History of San Giorgio", in ''Apollo'' (1976), p.8.&lt;/ref&gt; the interior of the refectory featured [[barrel vault]]s and [[groin vault]]s,  rectangular windows, and a [[cornice]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauritzen, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; In practise, Veronese's artistic prowess with [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and architecture (actual and virtual) persuaded the viewer to see ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' as a spacial extension of the refectory.&lt;ref&gt;Lauritzen, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="louvre.fr"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.louvre.fr/en/oeuvre-notices/wedding-feast-cana |title= ''Louvre Museum, collection of Italian paintings''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The subject===
In ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' (1563), Paolo Veronese depicts the [[New Testament]] story of the [[Marriage at Cana]] within the historical context of the [[Renaissance]] in the 16th century. In the [[Gospel of John]], the story of the first Christian miracle, [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], her son, [[Jesus of Nazareth]], and some of his [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostles]], attend a wedding in [[Cana]], a city in [[Galilee]]. In the course of the [[Wedding reception|wedding banquet]], the supply of wine was becoming depleted; at Mary's request, Jesus commanded the house servants to fill stone jugs with water, which he then [[Marriage at Cana|transformed into wine]] (John 2:1–11).

===The banquet===
''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' represents the water-into-wine miracle of Jesus in the grand style of the sumptuous feasts of food and music that were characteristic of 16th-century Venetian society; the sacred in and among the profane world where “banquet dishes not only signify wealth, power, and sophistication, but transfer those properties directly into the individual diner. An exquisite dish makes the diner exquisite.”&lt;ref&gt;Albala, Kenneth. ''Eating Right in the Renaissance'' (2002), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="d.macdonald"/&gt; 

[[File:Paolo Veronese - The Marriage at Cana (detail) - WGA24859.jpg|thumb|right|500px|The musicians providing ambience for ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' (1563) are personified by Veronese (viola da braccio), and the principal painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]]: Jacopo Bassano (flute), Tintoretto (viola da braccio) and Titian (violone); standing beside Titian is the poet [[Pietro Aretino]].&lt;ref name="Priever"&gt;Priever, Andrea. ''Paolo Caliari, called Veronese: 1528–1588'' (2000) Paul Aston and Fiona Hulse, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; (detail, lower centre-plane)]]

The banquet scene is framed with Greek and Roman architecture from [[Classical Antiquity]] and from the [[Renaissance]], Veronese’s contemporary era. The Græco–Roman architecture features [[Doric order]] and [[Corinthian order]] columns surrounding a courtyard that is enclosed with a low balustrade; in the distance, beyond the courtyard, there is an [[arcade (architecture)|arcaded]] tower, by the architect Andrea Palladio. In the foreground, musicians play stringed instruments of the [[Renaissance music|Late–Renaissance]], such as the lute, the violone, and the viola da gamba.&lt;ref name="Analysis" /&gt;
  
Among the wedding guests are historical personages, such as the monarchs [[Eleanor of Austria]], [[Francis I of France]], and [[Mary I of England]], [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], tenth sultan of the Ottoman Empire, and the Holy Roman [[Emperor Charles V]]; the poetess [[Vittoria Colonna]], the diplomat [[Marcantonio Barbaro]], and the architect [[Daniele Barbaro]]; the noblewoman [[Giulia Gonzaga]] and [[Cardinal Pole]], the last Roman Catholic Archbishop of Canterbury, the master jester [[Triboulet]] and the Ottoman statesman [[Sokollu Mehmet Paşa]] — all dressed in the sumptuous [[Western world|Occidental]] and [[Orientalism|Oriental]] fashions ''alla Turca'' popular in the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="Wedding Feast at Cana, Paolo Veronese: Analysis"&gt;''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' (1562–3), Paolo Veronese: Analysis. Art Encyclopedia. p. 3. http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/wedding-feast-at-cana.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

According to 18th-century legend and artistic tradition, the painter of the picture ([[Paolo Veronese]]) included himself to the banquet scene, as the musician in white tunic, who is playing a ''[[viola da braccio]]''. Accompanying Veronese are the principal painters of the [[Venetian school (art)|Venetian school]]: [[Jacopo Bassano]], playing the flute, [[Tintoretto]], also playing a ''viola da braccio'', and [[Titian]], dressed in red, playing the [[violone]]; besides them stands the poet [[Pietro Aretino]] considering a glass of the new red wine.&lt;ref name="Priever" /&gt;&lt;ref name="d.macdonald"/&gt;

===Symbolism===
[[File:Suleiman in Veronese The Wedding at Cana 1563.jpg|thumb|right|385px|In ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' (1563) Veronese shows the seated guests at the nuptial banquet-table awaiting the dessert-course wine service. The guests awaiting the new, red wine include [[Suleiman the Magnificent]], an elegant woman discreetly cleaning her teeth with a toothpick, and a woman urging her husband to ask the bride about the new red wine they have been served.

''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' (1563) is a painting of the [[Early Modern period]]; the religious and theological narrative of Veronese's interpretation of the water-into-wine miracle is in two parts.&lt;ref name="louvre.fr"/&gt;
 
'''I. On the horizontal axis —''' the lower-half of the painting contains 130 human figures; the upper-half of the painting is dominated by a cloudy sky  and Geæco–Roman architecture, which frames and contains the historical figures and Late-Renaissance personages invited to celebrate the bride and bridegroom at their wedding feast.&lt;ref name="d.macdonald"/&gt; Some human figures are rendered in [[Perspective (graphical)|foreshortened perspective]], the stylisation of Mannerism; the old architecture mirrors the contemporary architecture of Andrea Palladio; the narrative treatment places the [[Religious art|religious subject]] in a [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]] tableau of historical and contemporary personages, most of whom are fashionably dressed in costumes from the [[Orientalism|Orient]] — [[Eastern world|Asia]] as known to [[Renaissance]] society in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Wedding Feast at Cana, Paolo Veronese: Analysis" /&gt;
 
Seated behind and above the musicians are the Virgin Mary, Jesus of Nazareth, and some of his Apostles. Above the figure of Jesus, on an elevated walkway, a man watches the banquet, and a serving maid awaits for the carver to carve an animal to portions. To the right, a porter arrives with more meat for the feasting diners to eat. The alignment of the Jesus figure under the carver's blade and block, and the butchered animals, prefigure his sacrifice as the ''[[Lamb of God]]''.&lt;ref name="d.macdonald"/&gt;
 
'''bottom-right-quarter — '''  a barefoot wine-servant pours the new, red wine into a serving [[ewer]], from a large, ornate [[oenochoe]], which earlier had been filled with water. Behind the wine servant stands the poet [[Pietro Aretino]], intently considering the red wine in his glass.&lt;ref name="d.macdonald"/&gt;

'''bottom-left-quarter —''' the [[Majordomo|steward of the house]] (dressed in green) supervises the black servant-boy proffering a glass of the new, red wine to the bridegroom, the host of the wedding feast; at the edge of the nuptial table, a dwarf holds a bright-green parrot, and awaits instructions from the house steward.
 
'''II. On the vertical axis —''' the contrasts of light and shadow symbolize the co-existence of [[Death|mortality]] and [[vanitas]], the transitory pleasures of earthly life; the protocol of [[religious symbolism]] supersedes the social protocol.

In the wedding [[banquet]] proper, the holy guests and the mortal hosts have exchanged their social status, and so Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and some of his Apostles, are seated in the place of honour of the centre-span of the banquet table, whilst the bride and bridegroom sit, as guests, at the far end of the table's right wing. Above the Jesus figure, a carver is carving a lamb, beneath the Jesus figure, musicians play lively music, yet, before them is an [[hourglass]] — a reference to the futility of human [[vanity]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Wedding Feast at Cana'', Paolo Veronese: Analysis. Art Encyclopedia. p. 3. http://www.visual-arts-cork.com/famous-paintings/wedding-feast-at-cana.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, despite the kitchen's continuing preparation of [[Roasting|roasted meat]], the main course of a celebratory meal, the wedding guests are eating the [[dessert]] course, which includes fruit and nuts, wine and sweet [[quince cheese]] (symbolically edible marriage); that contradiction, between kitchen and diners, indicates that the animals are symbolic and not for eating.&lt;ref name="louvre.fr"/&gt;

==Plunder and re-installation==

[[File:Paolo Veronese, avtoportret.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Self-portrait of a [[Renaissance]] artist, by [[Paolo Veronese]] (1528–88)]]
From the 16th to the 18th centuries, for 235 years, the painting decorated the refectory of the church of San Giorgio Maggiore, until 11 September 1797, when soldiers of Napoleon’s [[French Revolutionary Army]] plundered the picture as war booty, during the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars]] (1792–1802). To readily transport the oversized painting — from a Venetian church to a Parisian museum — the French soldiers horizontally cut the canvas of ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'', and rolled it like a carpet, to be re-assembled and re-stitched in France.

In 1798, along with other plundered works of art, the 235-year-old painting was stored in the first floor of the Louvre Museum; five years later, in 1803, that store of looted art had become the ''Musée Napoléon'' — the personal art collection of the future [[Emperor of the French]].&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE2DF113BF932A25754C0A964958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=Veronese Masterpiece Damaged at the Louvre | author=Marlise Simons|date=11 July 1992|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, after the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803–15), the repatriation and restitution of looted works of art was integral to the post–Napoleonic conciliation treaties. Appointed by [[Pope Pius VII]], the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] sculptor [[Antonio Canova]] negotiated the French repatriation of Italian works of art that Napoleon had plundered from the [[Papal States]] with the [[Treaty of Tolentino]] (1797) — yet, the prejudiced curator of the Musée Napoléon, [[Vivant Denon]], falsely claimed that Veronese's canvas was too fragile to travel from Paris to Venice, and Canova excluded ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' (1563) from repatriation to Italy, and, in its stead, sent to Venice the ''Feast at the House of Simon'' (1653), by [[Charles Le Brun]].

In the late 19th century, during the [[Franco-Prussian War|Franco–Prussian War]] (1870–71), ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'', then 308 years old, was stored in a box at Brest, in Brittany. In the 20th century, during the [[World War II|Second World War]] (1939–45), the 382-year-old painting was rolled up for storage, and continually transported to hiding places throughout the south of France, lest Veronese's art become part of the [[Nazi plunder]] stolen during the twelve-year existence (1933–45) of the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt;

In the early 21st century, on 11 September 2007 — the 210th anniversary of the Napoleonic looting in 1797 — a computer-generated, [[Facsimile|digital facsimile]] of ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' was hung in the Palladian refectory of the Monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore, Venice. The full-sized (6.77m x 9.94m) digital facsimile is composed of 1,591 graphic files, and was made by [[Factum Arte]], Madrid, on commission from the [[Giorgio Cini Foundation]], Venice, and the Musée du Louvre, Paris.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.factum-arte.com/pag/537/Returning--quot-Les-Noces-de-Cana-quot--by-Paolo-Caliari Returning "Les Noces de Cana"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restoration==
In 1989, the Louvre Museum began a [[painting restoration]] of ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' (1563), which provoked an art-world controversy like that caused by the eleven-year [[Restoration of the Sistine Chapel frescoes]] (1989–99). Organised as the Association to Protect the Integrity of Artistic Heritage (APIAH), artists protested against the restoration of the 426-year-old painting, and publicly demanded to be included to the matter, which demand the Louvre Museum denied.&lt;ref&gt;Simons, Marlise, “Repaired Masterpiece Redisplayed”,'' The New York Times'', 17 December 1992, p. 00.&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Veronese, The Marriage at Cana (1563).jpg|thumb|right|500px|Until the 20th century, when the Louvre Museum restored ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' (1563), the [[Majordomo|steward of the house]] wore a red [[tabard]] coat; upon removal of the ''rouge marron'' red-hue, the colour of the tabard was green. (lower-left-quarter)]]

To the APIAH, especially controversial was the Museum's removal of a ''rouge marron'' [[Hue|red hue]] over-painting of the [[tabard]] coat of the house steward, who is standing (left-of-centre) in the foreground supervising the black, servant-boy handing a glass of the new, red wine to the bridegroom. The removal of the red hue revealed the original, green colour of the tabard. In opposing that aspect of the painting’s restoration, the APIAH said that Veronese, himself, had changed the tabard's colour to ''rouge marron'' instead of the green colour of the initial version of the painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gamboni, Dario. ''Returning “Les noces de Cana”, by Paolo Caliari, and Some Issues Concerning Repatriation and Originality'', Factum Arte, January 2008, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In June 1992, three years into the restoration of the painting, ''The Wedding Feast at Cana'' twice suffered accidental damages. In the first accident, the canvas was spattered with rainwater that leaked into the museum through an air vent. In the second accident, occurred two days later, the Louvre curators were raising the 1.5-ton-painting to a higher position upon the display-wall when a support-frame failed and collapsed. In falling to the museum floor, the metal framework that held and transported the painting punctured and tore the canvas; fortuitously, the five punctures and tears affected only the architectural and background areas of the painting, and not the faces of the wedding guests.&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt;

The '''University of Brighton Faculty of Arts''' was an organisational grouping at the University of Brighton centred around the University's origins in the Brighton School of Art, with courses in the creative arts, architecture, design and humanities. At different times it has been known as the '''Faculty of Art and Design''', the '''Faculty of Art and Architecture''' (1999-2009), the '''Faculty of Arts''' (2009-2014), and the '''College of Arts and Humanities''' (2014-2017). In 2017, the College structure was dissolved. At this time the constituent schools became independent units: the School of Architecture and Design, the School of Art, the School of Humanities, and the School of Media.

The Faculty hosted significant design and screen archives, and the [http://www.brighton.ac.uk/adm-hea/index.html Higher Education Academy Subject Centre for Art Design &amp; Media] (ADM HEA). In 2005 it was also recognised as a [[Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning through Design]] (CETLD), bringing together its knowledge and expertise with that of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]; the [[Royal College of Art]] and The [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]].

== Organisational structure and name changes ==
Since 1999, the Faculty has undergone a number of changes in organisation:
* Between 1999 and 2009 it was known as the Faculty of Art and Architecture. 
* In 2009 it took the name Faculty of Arts, embracing departments in literature, languages and media, and being organised in three schools: Architecture and Design, Art and Media, and Humanities. 
* In 2012, the Schools of Architecture and Design and Art and Media were merged to form the School of Art, Design and Media. 
* In 2014, the Faculty of Arts became the College of Arts and Humanities as part of a University wide reorganisation. 
* In 2016, the School of Art, Design and Media was split into three schools: the School of Architecture and Design (based at Mouslecoomb), the School of Art (at Grand Parade), and the School of Media (at Edward Street). 
* With the dissolution of the College in 2017, these schools, together with the School of Humanities, became independent organisational units within the University.

== Alumni, staff and associates ==
Brighton Faculty of Arts and Architecture has supported and educated many key figures in the arts. In 2009 an Exhibition, ''From Art School to University: Art and Design at Brighton 1859-2009'', paid tribute to many of them and included [[Turner Prize]] winners, iconic design work, cutting-edge dance for camera and classic rock and pop imagery.
 
Turner Prize winners [[Keith Tyson]] and [[Rachel Whiteread]] studied there, as did artists [[Alison Lapper]], [[Keith Coventry]], [[Sylvia Sleigh]], designer [[Julien Macdonald]] and writer-illustrator [[Emily Gravett]]. 

Students, lecturers and researchers once at Brighton includes sculptor [[Anthony Gormley]], Kate Greenaway Medal winners [[Emily Gravett]], [[Raymond Briggs]] and [[Quentin Blake]]; artist [[Mike Chaplin]]; children's writer-illustrator [[Lucy Cousins]]; Magnum photographer [[Mark Power]]; fashion designers [[Barbara Hulanicki]] and [[Julien Macdonald]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2004/041103fashionaward.php?PageId=824&lt;/ref&gt;

Contributions made to modern visual culture by Brighton Faculty of Arts and Architecture members include Royal Designer for Industry [[George Hardie (artist)|George Hardie]]'s cover designs for [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', and several series of Royal Mail stamps, and [[John Vernon Lord]]'s sleeve for [[Deep Purple]]'s ''Book of Taliesyn''.

The longer history of the school of art in Brighton includes artists [[Conrad Heighton Leigh]] and [[Helen Chadwick]], and poster designer [[John Bellany]].

== History ==
=== 19th century, Brighton School of Art ===
Ideas for the establishment of a School of Art in [[Brighton]] resulted from a public meeting in 1858 which led to the formation of a Committee to raise subscriptions and donations. The Committee sought to “instruct working people to do their work better by turning it out of hand neatly and handsomely as well as usefully, and thus enable them to command the best price for their labour, and to compete more successfully with the foreign workman”.&lt;ref&gt;"The Royal Visit to Brighton. Inauguration of the New School for Science and Art", ''Sussex Daily News'', 3 February 1877&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the art schools that had been established in Britain by the 1840s and 1850s were linked to local and regional industries. Brighton was not an industrial centre in the most obvious sense but, according to [[Henry Cole]] her "industries" were "health, recreation, education and pleasure".&lt;ref&gt;see Elizabeth Bonython and Anthony Burton, ''The Great Exhibitor: The Life and Work of Henry Cole'', London: V &amp; A, 2003. See also Louise Purbrick, "Building the house of Henry Cole", in Marcia Pointon (ed) ''Art apart: art institutions and ideology across England and North America'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

On Monday 17 January 1859 Brighton School of Art opened its doors to more than fifty pupils and was situated in a room off the [[Royal Pavilion]] Kitchen provided by the Town Council. The first Art Master was John White, who brought with him experience of a similar post at Leeds School of Practical Art and ran classes for several different constituencies: those of independent means who attended the Day Classes and were segregated by gender; artisans who were provided with evening classes at a low fee rate; and teachers, for whom fees were lower still.

New premises for Brighton School of Science and Art were purpose-built in Grand Parade, Brighton, in 1877, in a [[Romanesque Revival]] style, with the façade in brick with [[Bath stone]] coping and cornices. The columns flanking the main entrance were in polished red granite, and the façade enriched by a series of terracotta panels and lunettes that had been designed by the Art Master Alexander Fisher, and executed by Messrs Johnson at the nearby [[Ditchling]] Pottery Workshop.&lt;ref&gt;The two main panels and a small number of lunettes were saved when the building was demolished in the 1960s and are on public view in the current Grand Parade Campus.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll]], the most artistic of [[Queen Victoria]]’s children, and an accomplished sculptor in her own right, was present, as was Victorian art educational tsar, Sir [[Henry Cole]].

=== 20th century ===
As a result of new openings for local authorities, a new Municipal School of Science and Technology, designed by F C May, the Borough Surveyor and Engineer, was opened on 20 September 1897.  This allowed for an expansion of activities in the School in Grand Parade. At Brighton before [[World War I]], the portfolio of courses at the School of Art included [[typography]], [[silversmithing]], jewellery, leatherwork, woodcarving, [[embroidery]] and lace making.

In 1915, the [[Design and Industries Association]] (DIA) was established, a national non government-funded organisation that set out to establish stronger relationships between British designers and manufacturers. The Head Master at Brighton, William H Bond, played an important role in promoting the aims of the DIA in the town, explaining how Britain lagged behind her competitors such as Germany and America, claiming that the typographer "[[Edward Johnston]]  was far better known in Germany than he was in England five years ago".&lt;ref&gt;‘Design in Manufacture: At Upheld by Commerce, ''[[Brighton Herald]]'' 13 October 1915.&lt;/ref&gt;  During World War I the School of Art provided opportunities for a number of disabled soldiers at the Brighton Pavilion Hospital, offering training for such occupations as letter cutting in wood and stone, mechanical draughtsmanship, die-cutting and other related subjects that required instruction in [[industrial arts]]. Bond was also concerned with the appearance of Brighton, reacting negatively to many aspects of the urban environment, a theme that a number of his British arts and crafts antecedents such as John Ruskin and William Morris had pursued with zeal. Bond complained about the ‘gruesome horror’ of the New England Road railway arch and commented on plans to render it an ‘attractive entrance to the town’.  He also argued for the preservation of the ‘distinctive soul’ of Georgian Brighton (cf [[Georgian Architecture]])and that the Town Council should desist from painting the Royal Pavilion ‘[[workhouse]] yellow’ as it represented the ‘last despairing cry of colour on its deathbed, and in its raucous tones some devilish influences might be traced’.&lt;ref&gt;‘How to Beautify Brighton”, ''[[Brighton Herald]]'', 30 March 1918&lt;/ref&gt; 
The work of Brighton School of Art performed well in the international arena. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that at the 1925 Paris [[Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes]], it received a Diploma of Honour for technical instruction, a Gold Medal for technical instruction in ceramics, and Silver Medals for technical instruction in textiles and metal.

Mural art was a field in which Brighton staff were widely recognised, bringing together the fine arts and interior design. A notable example of this was seen in the interiors of the Regent Cinema, Brighton, which included murals by Lawrence Preston of Brighton School of Art and Walter Bayes, Head of the Westminster School of Art. Lawrence Preston’s other mural schemes included his First World War mural at St Luke’s School, Brighton, restored in 2007 after a £30,000 fund-raising campaign. Dorothy Sawyers, another member of staff at the School was also widely known as a muralist who worked on cinema schemes.

Following the appointment in 1934 of E A Sallis Benney as its Principal, Brighton School of Art became involved with presenting its own fresh, modern and international profile. While, during [[World War II]], the School of Art was able to demonstrate its usefulness to the wider community through involvement with the [[propaganda]] campaigns, in which the Women’s Crafts Department provided a particular focus, especially in the ‘Make Do and Mend’ ethos following the introduction of clothes [[rationing in the United Kingdom]] in 1941.

Brighton College of Art did not have specific industrial links in the way that was the case with similar educational organisations in [[Manchester]] and [[Birmingham]].  Nonetheless, in the 1950s it was well placed to provide expertise in commercial and industrial design and worked with industry through a number of Advisory Committees alongside local, regional and national arts associations.  Such activities found their applications in the development of the curriculum.  For example, in 1951, the first cohort of students completed the National Retail Association of Furniture Retailers Diploma, launched at the College in 1949 as the first such course outside London

=== Polytechnic ===

Following the 1963 [[Robbins Report]] on Higher Education and the White Paper, 'A Plan for Polytechnics', there emerged proposals for Brighton Polytechnic, along with Brighton College of Technology. Brighton’s Education Committee took the view that the Brighton College of Art should be preserved as a specialist institution of art and design. However, despite the uneasy accommodation of different standpoints at Brighton, the wider national campaigns against the absorption of art colleges into polytechnics continued into the 1970s, an outlook typified by painter [[Patrick Heron]]'s article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in October 1971, entitled "Murder in the Art Schools". 

The Town Council decided to employ the municipal architect, Percy Billington, for the new building, rejecting the Education Committee’s earlier enquiries into the possibility of bringing in outside architects sympathetic to the [[Regency architecture|Regency style]]. Considerable local anger had been expressed about the possibility of demolishing a Grade II-listed terrace of Regency houses ignoring the advice of the Royal Fine Art Commission. Michael Viney, however, described it: “Decisively modern and pseudo anything, the building nonetheless makes gradual easy transition from the Regency bow-fronts adjacent in Grand Parade to the sharper, cleaner, more functional lines of 1958.”  

From its earliest days Brighton School of Art (and successors) has maintained involved with the town and regional community, whether in such areas as the annual displays of student work or close relationship with many of the trades in the town. On a wider cultural front staff and students’ participation in public performances began in the 1860s and constantly punctuated its history, whether the Carnivals and  ‘Vision of Empire’ for Empire Week in the 1920s, innovative performance and ‘live art’ at the Zap Club in the 1980s, or a wide variety of more recent manifestations such as ‘Dance for Camera’ and ‘Smudged’ at Tate Modern led by Alice Fox.

The Art College Basement Club was an important catalyst in the development of live and performing arts at Brighton. It hosted a wide range of performances, such as those associated with the innovative Brighton Contemporary Festival Arts (1977–79) organised by Roger Ely and Neil Butler. Dave Reeves, with Butler, was one of the founding directors of [[the Zap]] Club.

A fresh diet of courses and innovations were rolled out during Robin Plummer’s headship. During this period the range of courses included Fashion &amp; Textiles with Administration, Graphic Design &amp; Illustration, Expressive Arts (including music, dance, performance, theatre and visual studies) and History of Design, with the development of a number of postgraduate courses including Printmaking and Narrative and Sequential Illustration. A new Department of Art History was formed and headed by Robert Haynes in 1977. David Vaughan was appointed as course leader for the BA (Hons) Wood, Metal, Ceramics and Plastics degree in 1979, later becoming head of the department of Three Dimensional Design. Another key appointment made in these years was that of Bill Beech who was appointed as the head of the department of Fine Art following the retirement of Gwyther Irwin in 1984. In September 1986 the Department of Humanities joined the Faculty thereby setting in place the opportunity to develop fresh curricular initiatives.

=== Research Development ===
Robin Plummer was quick to see the importance of research for art and design, arguing for it nationally and implementing it locally, notably in the Brighton Design History: Fad or Function? Conference in 1977.  Evelyn Goldsmith’s PhD, completed in 1978, led to her book entitled Research into illustration: an approach and a review, published by Cambridge University Press in 1984. The merging of the Polytechnic with the Brighton College of Education in 1976 resulted in the transfer of the Department of Art Education to the Polytechnic’s newly created Faculty of Education, long a distinctive aspect of the School of Art in its rite of passage from School of Art to Faculty of Art &amp; Design.  However, a number of academics specialising in the visual and performing arts joined the Faculty of Art and Design. This in turn led to the formation of a new Department of Combined Arts under the leadership of Peter Rose.  Despite some misgivings on the part of a number of practitioners in the more established disciplinary fields in the Faculty, this proved to be a dynamic, challenging and highly productive initiative, with Liz Aggiss and Billy Cowie playing key roles.

=== New University ===
A number of highly significant steps have been taken at Brighton since the 1960s, sustained by enhanced and developing intellectual and material resources.  These include the establishment of Screen Archive South East, the Design Archives and the establishment of the Centre for Research &amp; Development; the hosting of the CTI (Computers in Teaching Initiative) Centre for Art and Design, the [[Brighton Photo Biennial]], Cinecity and the National Subject Centre for Learning &amp; Teaching in Art, Design &amp; Communications and its successor, the Higher Education Academy: Art, Design Media Subject Centre, and the establishment of the Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning through Design (CETLD). Many other networks, national and international, formal and informal have also been set in place

The institution’s re-designation as the University of Brighton in 1992, with Professor David Watson as Vice-Chancellor, resulted in a number of fresh opportunities. Since 1992 there has been a discernible change in the ways in which the Faculty views itself and how the rest of the University, in turn, sees it. Success in art and design in the first round of the RAE which the University was able to enter confirmed two lingering prejudices: from the art and design perspective, there was still an aura of the notion of excellence as something that had been known since pre-polytechnic, independent art college days; from the standpoint of some other parts of the university there was still a lingering view that it was somehow easier for art and design to achieve academic and research success.

In 2009 plans to expand the Faculty came to fruition. From elsewhere in the University, departments of English language and literature, media, linguistics and modern languages became included under the new Faculty of Arts, reinforcing the long-established academic work of the 'Art School' in historical and critical studies, communication and media.

[[File:We Can Do It!.jpg|thumb|250px|J. Howard Miller's "We Can Do It!" poster from 1943]]
"'''We Can Do It!'''" is an American World War II wartime poster produced by J. Howard Miller in 1943 for [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] as an inspirational image to boost worker morale.

The poster was very little seen during World War II. It was rediscovered in the early 1980s and widely reproduced in many forms, often called "We Can Do It!" but also called "[[Rosie the Riveter]]" after the iconic figure of a strong female war production worker. The "We Can Do It!" image was used to promote [[feminism]] and other political issues beginning in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006&gt;{{cite journal |first1=James J. |last1=Kimble |first2=Lester C. |last2=Olson |title=Visual Rhetoric Representing Rosie the Riveter: Myth and Misconception in J.

It was incorporated in 2008 into campaign materials for several American politicians, and was reworked by an artist in 2010 to celebrate the [[Julia Gillard|first woman]] becoming [[prime minister of Australia]]. The poster is one of the ten most-requested images at the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;

After its rediscovery, observers often assumed that the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder.&lt;ref name=Design4Victory&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SSNo6on0F8EC&amp;pg=PA78 |page=78 |title=Design for Victory: World War II posters on the American home front |first1=William L. |last1=Bird |first2=Harry R. |last2=Rubenstein |publisher=Princeton Architectural Press |year=1998 |isbn=978-1-56898-140-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many different forms, including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.

After she saw the ''Smithsonian'' cover image in 1994, [[Geraldine Hoff Doyle]] mistakenly said that she was the subject of the poster. Doyle thought that she had also been captured in a wartime photograph of a woman factory worker, and she innocently assumed that this photo inspired Miller's poster. Conflating her as "Rosie the Riveter", Doyle was honored by many organizations including the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame|Michigan Women's Historical Center and Hall of Fame]]. However, in 2015, the woman in the wartime photograph was identified as then 20-year-old [[Naomi Parker Fraley|Naomi Parker]], working in early 1942 before Doyle had graduated from high school. Doyle's notion that the photograph inspired the poster cannot be proved or disproved, so neither Doyle nor Parker can be confirmed as the model for "We Can Do It!"

==Background==
[[File:TOGETHER WE CAN DO IT - KEEP `EM FIRING - NARA - 515856.jpg|thumb|upright|A propaganda poster from 1942 encouraging unity between labor and management of [[General Motors|GM]]]]
After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the U.S. government called upon manufacturers to produce greater amounts of war goods. The workplace atmosphere at large factories was often tense because of resentment built up between management and labor unions throughout the 1930s. Directors of companies such as [[General Motors]] (GM) sought to minimize past friction and encourage teamwork. In response to a rumored public relations campaign by the [[United Auto Workers]] union, GM quickly produced a propaganda poster in 1942 showing both labor and management rolling up their sleeves, aligned toward maintaining a steady rate of war production. The poster read, "Together We Can Do It!" and "Keep 'Em Firing!"&lt;ref name=BirdRubenstein58&gt;Bird/Rubenstein 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=gaRRtWEH2pgC&amp;pg=PA58 p. 58].&lt;/ref&gt; In creating such posters, corporations wished to increase production by tapping popular pro-war sentiment, with the ultimate goal of preventing the government from exerting greater control over production.&lt;ref name=BirdRubenstein58/&gt;

J. Howard Miller was an American [[graphic artist]].

Miller studied at the [[Art Institute of Pittsburgh]], graduating in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-sUP0B83GMMC&amp;pg=PA16 |page=16 |first1=Jacquelyn Felix |last1=Fisher |first2=E.

His work came to the attention of the Westinghouse Company (later, the Westinghouse War Production Co-Ordinating Committee), and he was hired to create a series of posters.  The posters were sponsored by the company's internal War Production Co-Ordinating Committee, one of the hundreds of labor-management committees organized under the supervision of the national War Production Board.

===Westinghouse Electric===
In 1942, Miller was hired by Westinghouse Electric's internal War Production Coordinating Committee, through an advertising agency, to create a series of posters to display to the company's workers.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h4T1DWEECUC&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |title=Smokey, Rosie, and You! |first1=David A. |last1=Ehrlich |first2=Alan R. |last2=Minton |first3=Diane |last3=Stoy |publisher=Hillcrest Publishing Group |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-934248-33-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intent of the poster project was to raise worker morale, to reduce absenteeism, to direct workers' questions to management, and to lower the likelihood of labor unrest or a factory strike. Each of the more than 42 posters designed by Miller was displayed in the factory for two weeks, then replaced by the next one in the series. Most of the posters featured men; they emphasized traditional roles for men and women. One of the posters pictured a smiling male manager with the words "Any Questions About Your Work?&amp;nbsp;... Ask your Supervisor."&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Design4Victory/&gt;

==Rosie the Riveter==
{{Main article|Rosie the Riveter}}
During World War II, the "We Can Do It!" poster was not connected to the 1942 song "Rosie the Riveter", nor to the widely seen [[Norman Rockwell]] painting called ''Rosie the Riveter'' that appeared on the cover of the [[Memorial Day]] issue of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'', May 29, 1943. The Westinghouse poster was not associated with any of the women nicknamed "Rosie" who came forward to promote women working for war production on the home front. Rather, after being displayed for two weeks in February 1943 to some Westinghouse factory workers, it disappeared for nearly four decades.&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Dennis |last=McLellan |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-geraldine-hoff-doyle-20101231,0,1376340.story |title=Geraldine Hoff Doyle dies at 86; inspiration behind a famous wartime poster |work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjbR9EXABPEC&amp;pg=PA606 |page=606 |title=World War II and the Postwar Years in America: A Historical and Cultural Encyclopedia |volume=1 |first1=William H. |last1=Young |first2=Nancy K. |last2=Young |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2010 |isbn=978-0-313-35652-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other "Rosie" images prevailed, often photographs of actual workers. The [[United States Office of War Information|Office of War Information]] geared up for a massive nationwide advertising campaign to sell the war, but "We Can Do It!" was not part of it.&lt;ref name=Secrets2011/&gt;

Rockwell's emblematic ''Rosie the Riveter'' painting was loaned by the ''Post'' to the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] for use in posters and campaigns promoting [[war bond]]s. Following the war, the Rockwell painting gradually sank from public memory because it was copyrighted; all of Rockwell's paintings were vigorously defended by his estate after his death. This protection resulted in the original painting gaining value—it sold for nearly $5&amp;nbsp;million in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F5wukQLkavoC&amp;pg=PA399 |page=399 |title=American Women during World War II: an encyclopedia |last=Weatherford |first=Doris |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0-415-99475-0 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the lack of protection for the "We Can Do It!" image is one of the reasons it experienced a rebirth.&lt;ref name=loc/&gt;

Ed Reis, a volunteer historian for Westinghouse, noted that the original image was not shown to female [[riveter]]s during the war, so the recent association with "Rosie the Riveter" was unjustified. Rather, it was targeted at women who were making helmet liners out of [[Micarta]]. Reis joked that the woman in the image was more likely to have been named "Molly the Micarta Molder or Helen the Helmet Liner Maker."&lt;ref name=CushingDrescher2009/&gt;

==Rediscovery==
[[File:We Can Do It water bottles.jpg|thumb|left|An example of commercial use on a pair of vending machines for bottled water]]
In 1982, the "We Can Do It!" poster was reproduced in a magazine article, "Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake", a [[The Washington Post|''Washington Post Magazine'']] article about posters in the collection of the [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Patricia |last=Brennan |title=Poster Art for Patriotism's Sake |journal=[[The Washington Post|Washington Post Magazine]] |date=May 23, 1982 |page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In subsequent years, the poster was re-appropriated to promote [[feminism]]. Feminists saw in the image an embodiment of female empowerment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KlxHgYqgDswC&amp;pg=PA601 |page=601 |chapter=Rosie the Riveter |last=Endres |first=Kathleen L. |title=American icons: an encyclopedia of the people, places, and things |editor=Dennis Hall, Susan G.

This was very different from the poster's 1943 use to control employees and to discourage labor unrest.&lt;ref name=MythMisconception2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Secrets2011/&gt; History professor Jeremiah Axelrod commented on the image's combination of femininity with the "masculine (almost macho) composition and body language."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Diederik Oostdijk, Markha G.

[[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine put the image on its cover in March 1994, to invite the viewer to read a featured article about wartime posters.

In 1984, former war worker [[Geraldine Doyle|Geraldine Hoff Doyle]] came across an article in ''[[AARP The Magazine|Modern Maturity]]'' magazine which showed a wartime photograph of a young woman working at a lathe, and she assumed that the photograph was taken of her in mid-to-late 1942 when she was working briefly in a factory. Ten years later, Doyle saw the "We Can Do It!" poster on the front of the [[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian'']] magazine and assumed the poster was an image of herself. Without intending to profit from the connection, Doyle decided that the 1942 wartime photograph had inspired Miller to create the poster, making Doyle herself the model for the poster.&lt;ref name=Kimble2016&gt;{{cite journal |title=Rosie's Secret Identity, or, How to Debunk a Woozle by Walking Backward through the Forest of Visual Rhetoric |last=Kimble |first=James J. |date=Summer 2016 |journal=Rhetoric and Public Affairs |volume=19 |number=2 |pages=245–274 |issn=1094-8392}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Doyle was widely credited as the inspiration for Miller's poster.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt;&lt;ref name="nbcnews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Chuck |first=Elizabeth |title=Geraldine Doyle, inspiration for 'Rosie the Riveter,' dies at 86 |url=http://fieldnotes.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/12/30/5738254-geraldine-doyle-inspiration-for-rosie-the-riveter-dies-at-86 |accessdate=July 1, 2015 |work=Field Notes from NBC News |date=December 30, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101123212/http://fieldnotes.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2010/12/30/5738254-geraldine-doyle-inspiration-for-rosie-the-riveter-dies-at-86 |archivedate=January 1, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/30/us/30doyle.html |title=Geraldine Doyle, Iconic Face of World War II, Dies at 86 |date=December 29, 2010 |last=Williams |first=Timothy |work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|last=Memmot |first=Mark |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/12/30/132484640/michigan-woman-who-inspired-wwii-rosie-poster-has-died |title=Michigan Woman Who Inspired WWII 'Rosie' Poster Has Died |publisher=NPR |date=December 31, 2010 |accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Michigan History Magazine |volume=78 |pages=54–55 |year=1994 |title=Geraldine Hoff Doyle |last=Schimpf |first=Sheila }}&lt;/ref&gt; From an archive of [[ACME Newspictures|Acme news photographs]], Professor James J.

Although many publications have repeated Doyle's unsupported assertion that the wartime photograph inspired Miller's poster,&lt;ref name=Kimble2016/&gt; Westinghouse historian Charles A.

After [[Julia Gillard]] became the first female [[prime minister of Australia]] in June 2010, a [[Melbourne]] [[street art]]ist calling himself Phoenix pasted Gillard's face into a new monochrome version of the "We Can Do It!" poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/4748630334/ |date=June 29, 2010 |title=We Can Do It! |author=Phoenix |publisher=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[AnOther Magazine]]'' published a photograph of the poster taken on [[Hosier Lane, Melbourne]], in July 2010, showing that the original "War Production Co-ordinating Committee" mark in the lower right had been replaced with a [[Uniform resource locator|URL]] pointing to Phoenix's [[Flickr]] photostream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.anothermag.com/current/view/348/Australian_President_Julia_Gillard |title=Australian President, Julia Gillard |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:v3jSEN5VM78J:www.anothermag.com/current/view/348/Australian_President_Julia_Gillard+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us |archivedate=September 27, 2012 |date=July 27, 2010 |journal=[[AnOther Magazine]] |first=David |last=Hellqvist |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://damadesign.tumblr.com/post/866607274/julia-gillard-former-president-of-australia-as |date=July 8, 2010 |title=Julia Gillard |author=Dama Design |publisher=[[Tumblr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/5523564006/ |date=March 12, 2011 |title=We Can Do It! |author=Phoenix |publisher=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, Phoenix produced a color version which stated "She Did It!" in the lower right,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/4759196620/in/photostream// |date=July 2, 2010 |title=We Can Do It! |author=Phoenix |publisher=[[Flickr]] |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; then in January 2012 he pasted "Too Sad" diagonally across the poster to represent his disappointment with developments in Australian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/phoenixthestreetartist/6808410971/ |date=January 23, 2012 |title=She Did It!

Geraldine Doyle died in December 2010. ''[[Utne Reader]]'' went ahead with their scheduled January–February 2011 cover image: a parody of "We Can Do It!" featuring [[Marge Simpson]] raising her right hand in a fist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.utne.com/table-of-contents-january-february-2011.aspx |title=Table of Contents |date=January–February 2011 |work=Utne Reader |accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The editors of the magazine expressed regret at the passing of Doyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://utnereader.tumblr.com/post/2585298665 |title=untitled |work=Utne Reader editorial blog |date=January 3, 2011 |publisher=Utne Reader |accessdate=January 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130623045811/http://utnereader.tumblr.com/post/2585298665 |archivedate=June 23, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Stereoscopy|stereoscopic]] (3D) image of "We Can Do It!" was created for the closing credits of the 2011 superhero film ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]''. The image served as the background for the title card of English actress [[Hayley Atwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Captain America: The First Avenger |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/captain-america-the-first-avenger/ |work=Art of the Title |first=Lola |last=Landekic |date=August 30, 2011 |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ad Council]] claimed the poster was developed in 1942 by its precursor, the War Advertising Committee, as part of a "Women in War Jobs" campaign, helping to bring "over two million women" into war production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/timeline.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216085055/http://www.adcouncil.org/timeline.html |title=The Story of the Ad Council |publisher=Ad Council |archivedate=February 16, 2007 |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adcouncil.org/About-Us/Frequently-Asked-Questions |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Ad Council |accessdate=September 24, 2012 |quote=Working in tandem with the Office of War Information, the Ad Council created campaigns such as Buy War Bonds, Plant Victory Gardens, 'Loose Lips Sink Ships,' and Rosie the Riveter's 'We Can Do it.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Conlon&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/peggy-conlon/happy-birthday-ad-council_b_1269338.html |last=Conlon |first=Peggy |title=Happy Birthday Ad Council!

The [[Facebook Platform|Facebook app]] was called "Rosify Yourself", referring to Rosie the Riveter; it allowed viewers to upload images of their faces to be incorporated into the "We Can Do It!" poster, then saved to be shared with friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.helpsgood.com/post/17615327499/helpsgood-develops-rosify-yourself-app-for-ad?ad313a00 |title=HelpsGood Develops 'Rosify Yourself' App for Ad Council's 70th Birthday |date=February 2012 |publisher=HelpsGood |accessdate=September 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130126165316/http://www.helpsgood.com/post/17615327499/helpsgood-develops-rosify-yourself-app-for-ad?ad313a00 |archivedate=January 26, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ad Council President and CEO Peggy Conlon posted her own "Rosified" face on ''[[Huffington Post]]'' in an article she wrote about the group's 70-year history.&lt;ref name=Conlon/&gt; The staff of the television show [[Today (U.S. TV program)|''Today'']] posted two "Rosified" images on their website, using the faces of news anchors [[Matt Lauer]] and [[Ann Curry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://allday.today.com/_news/2012/02/13/10395999-plaza-sign-of-the-day-matt-as-rosie-the-riveter |title=Plaza sign of the day: Matt as Rosie the Riveter |last=Veres |first=Steve |date=February 13, 2012 |work=Today |publisher=MSN Allday Today |accessdate=September 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Seton Hall University]] professor James J.
