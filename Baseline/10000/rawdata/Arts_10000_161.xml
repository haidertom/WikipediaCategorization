[[File:Arts District, Las Vegas, United States (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|right|250px|A Pink Cadillac in the Downtown Arts District.]]

The '''Las Vegas Arts District''', or the '''18b''' in [[Downtown Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] was created in 1998 as an 18 block zone set aside to encourage art and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Downtown Arts District  | url=http://www.fodors.com/world/north-america/usa/nevada/las-vegas/review-178016.html | work=[[Fodor's Travel]] | publisher=[[Random House]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The district won [[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]'s ''Best of Las Vegas'' award in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Ken |last = White| title=Downtown Arts District finally taking hold | url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/bestoflv/2005/bestartsdistrict.jsp;jsessionid=BMGLLJLEFKAA | work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as the 18b, the Las Vegas Arts District contains a mix of independent businesses including [[vintage clothing]] boutiques, antique stores, art galleries, hair salons, restaurants,  
The 18b is located halfway between the Fremont East Entertainment district and the Stratosphere Resort, clustered around Main and Charleston, bounded loosely by Commerce Street to the West, Hoover Avenue to the North, Fourth Street to the East and Wyoming Avenue at the south. It is an easy bike ride, walk or bus ride from Fremont Street.  The name, "18b," represents the original Arts District area, which consisted of 18 blocks. Today, the Arts District area has grown beyond those original 18 blocks and is a classic urban mix of residential, commercial and cultural uses that will continue to grow as the hub of the arts scene in Las Vegas.

The "First Friday" Art Walk is a monthly arts and cultural event drawing up to 30,000 visitors into the neighborhood on the first Friday evening of each month. This event encourages people to flock downtown to browse, buy, eat, drink and mingle. The event is a festival environment with food and beverage vendors, music, visual performances and artists/artisans/craftspeople displaying their works.

== Events ==
The district hosts a ''First Friday'' art walk on the first Friday of every month.  First Friday offers an eclectic group of artists as well as "entertainers of all types, including local bands, fire breathers, acrobats, break dancers, fortune tellers and performance artists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Artsy Schmartzy | url=http://www.jewishlasvegas.com/page.aspx?id=148648 | publisher=[[United Jewish Communities]] | accessdate=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to ''First Friday'', Preview Thursday is held preceding night before the block party. It is a subdued night of gallery openings and special events around the arts district without the large crowds that the main event can bring.

== Boundaries ==
The district is loosely bounded by Hoover Avenue, Wyoming Avenue, [[Las Vegas Boulevard]], and Commerce Street. The official bounds are visible on the ''City of Las Vegas'' website.

==Top-grossing films (U.S.)&lt;ref&gt;Box Office Digest, April 1941, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;==
At the time, box office numbers were reported as a percentage of business for each theater in comparison to 'normal' business. For example, [[Boom Town (film)|Boom Town]] performed at 232% and [[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]] at 130%.  This is why exact dollar grosses for films are unreliable at best.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3264">[[File:Correggio_-_Allegory_of_Vices_-_WGA05339.jpg|thumb|350px]]
The '''''Allegory of Vice''''' is an oil on canvas painting by [[Correggio]] dating to around 1531 and measuring 149 by 88 cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Giuseppe Adani, ''Correggio pittore universale'', Silvana Editoriale, Correggio 2007. {{ISBN|9788836609772}}&lt;/ref&gt; It and ''[[Allegory of Virtue (Correggio)|Allegory of Virtue]]'' were painted as a pair for the [[Cabinet (room)|studiolo]] of [[Isabella d'Este]], with ''Vice'' probably the second of the two to be completed. This hypothesis is since only one (possibly non-autograph) sketch survives for ''Vice'', unlike ''Virtue'', for which several preparatory studies survive, along with a near-complete under-drawing - this suggests Correggio had become more proficient after the difficult gestation of ''Virtue''.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} Mauro Lucco (ed), ''Mantegna a Mantova 1460-1506'', exhibition catalogue, Skira Milano, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the [[Laocoön and His Sons|Laocoon]] (as is Corregio's treatment of [[Saint Roch]] in his [[San Sebastiano Madonna]] and ''Four Saints''), the central male figure is sometimes identified as a personification of Vice but sometimes as [[Silenus]] (possibly from Virgil's ''[[Eclogues]]'' 6, where a sleeping Silenus is tied up by the shepherds Chromi and Marsillo and forced to sing by them and the nymph Egle) or [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]]. It was even misidentified as [[Apollo (mythology)|Apollo]] and [[Marsyas]] by the writer of the [[Gonzaga collection]] inventory of 1542. This misunderstanding may have contributed to an ''Apollo and Marsyas'' (actually by the studio or circle of [[Bronzino]]) being historically misattributed to Correggio.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.correggioarthome.it/Sezione.jsp?idSezione=171&amp;idSezioneRif=54|title=Giulio Sanuto, Apollo e Marsia, 1562 - Correggio ART HOME|last=srl|first=Netribe|website=www.correggioarthome.it|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The putto in the foreground is influenced by [[Raphael]]'s putti in the [[Sistine Chapel]].

In 1542, after Isabella's death, they were both recorded as hanging on either side of the entrance door "in the Corte Vecchia near the grotto", with ''Vice'' on the left and ''Virtue'' on the right. After the contents of her studiolo were dispersed, it remained in Mantua at least until 1627, but the following year it was sold to [[Charles I of Great Britain]]. After his execution it was purchased by [[cardinal Mazarin]] in 1661 and later by the banker [[Everhard Jabach]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cartelfr.louvre.fr/cartelfr/visite?srv=car_not_frame&amp;idNotice=14293&amp;langue=fr|title=Site officiel du musée du Louvre|website=cartelfr.louvre.fr|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; who later sold it to [[Louis XIV]] in Paris, reuniting it with ''Virtue''.

[[Image:Jade Bi Ornament, Dragon designs, China - Warring States period, Western Han dynasty, 4th-2nd century BC.tiff|thumb|A Western Han dynasty Bi, with dragon designs.]]
The '''bi''' is a type of circular ancient [[Chinese jade]] artifact. The earliest ''bi'' were produced in the [[Neolithic]] period, particularly by the [[Liangzhu culture]] ([[3400 BC|3400]]–[[2250 BCE]]).&lt;ref name="nga.gov"&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_sl03.shtm Teaching Chinese Archaeology, object 3 - NGA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508040340/http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_sl03.shtm |date=May 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later examples date mainly from the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]], [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]] and [[Han Dynasty|Han]] dynasties. They were also made in [[Ancient Chinese glass|glass]].

==Description==
A ''bi'' is a flat jade disc with a circular hole in the centre. Neolithic ''bi'' are undecorated, while those of later periods of China, like the Zhou dynasty, bear increasingly ornate surface carving (particularly in a hexagonal pattern) whose motifs represented deities associated with the sky (four directions) as well as standing for qualities and powers the wearer wanted to invoke or embody.

As laboriously crafted objects, they testify to the concentration of power and resources in the hands of a small elite.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"/&gt;

==Meaning==
Later traditions associate the ''bi'' with heaven, and the ''[[Cong (jade)|cong]]'' with the earth. Bi disks are consistently found with heaven and earth-like imagery, suggesting that the disk's circular shape also bears symbolic significance as this description explains:

{{quote|It is found that these objects testify to early stages of development of cosmological concepts that remained important in Chinese culture during the Warring States and Han periods: the notion of a covering sky (''gaitian'') that revolves around a central axis, the cycle of the Ten Suns, and the use of an early form of the carpenter's square. These objects were handled by shamans who were the religious leaders of Liangzhu society and the transmitters of cosmological knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shu-P'Ing |first1=Teng |title=The Original Significance of ''Bi'' Disks: Insights Based on Liangzhu Jade ''Bi'' with Incised Symbolic Motifs |journal=Journal of East Asian Archaeology |date=2000 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=165–194 |doi=10.1163/156852300509835}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Function==
[[File:Bi with two dragons and grain pattern.jpg|thumb|Bi disc with a dual dragon motif, [[Warring States period]]]]
The original function and significance of the ''bi'' are unknown, as the Neolithic cultures have left no written history. From these earliest times they were buried with the dead, as a sky symbol, accompanying the dead into the after world or "sky", with the cong which connected the body with the earth.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"/&gt; They were placed ceremonially on the body in the grave of persons of high social status. ''Bi'' are sometimes found near the stomach and chest in neolithic burials.&lt;ref name="nga.gov"/&gt;

Jade, like bi disks, has been used throughout Chinese history to indicate an individual of moral quality, and has also served as an important symbol of rank. They were used in worship and ceremony – as ceremonial items they symbolised the ranks of emperor, king, duke, marquis, viscount, and baron with four different ''[[Gui_(vessel)|Gui]]s'' and two different bi disks.

In war during the Zhou dynasty period (c. 1046–256 BCE), bi disks belonging to the leaders of the defeated forces were handed over to the victor as a sign of submission.

==Influences==
The design of the reverse side of the medals given in the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in [[Beijing]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] are based on bi disks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214070893.shtml Design of the Medal for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812163040/http://en.beijing2008.cn/spirit/beijing2008/graphic/n214070893.shtml |date=August 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Council of Science Editors''' ('''CSE''') is a [[United States]]-based nonprofit organization that supports editorial practice among scientific writers. In 2008, the CSE adopted the slogan "CSE: Education, Ethics, and Evidence for Editors (E4)".

A volunteer Board of Directors leads the Council, with the assistance of several committees. CSE is managed by Kellen Company, located in [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado|Wheat Ridge]], [[Colorado]].

== History and organization==

The organization was established in 1957 by the [[National Science Foundation]] and the [[American Institute of Biological Sciences]] as the '''Council of Biology Editors''' (CBE),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/lls/students/cse_citation.html | title = CSE Quick Citation Guide | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121214210911/http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/lls/students/cse_citation.html |archive-date=2012-12-14 |publisher = [[Pennsylvania State University Libraries]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; being renamed the Council of Science Editors, with a broader mission, on January 1, 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.councilscienceeditors.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3280 History of the Council of Science Editors], 2013, Council of Science Editors.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://polishedpaper.com/cse-style-guide | title = III.

A '''courtroom sketch''' is an artistic depiction of the proceedings in a [[court]] of law. In many jurisdictions, cameras are not allowed in courtrooms in order to prevent distractions and preserve privacy. This requires news media to rely on [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]] artists for illustrations of the proceedings.

==Creating courtroom sketches==
Courtroom sketch artists attend judicial proceedings as members of the public or as credentialed media depending on the venue and jurisdiction. Judges may require or allow artists to sit in a designated area or they may sit in general public seating. In some jurisdictions, including the [[United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/a_to_c/contempt_of_court/|title=Contempt of Court|publisher=Crown Prosecution Service |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news |author= Guy Dammann |title= A sketchy future for courtroom artists |date=14 November 2006 |publisher=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/artblog/2006/nov/14/courtroomartblog |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hong Kong]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/e1bf50c09a33d3dc482564840019d2f4/7889947f4e45de60c825648300287125?OpenDocument |title=Chapter 228, Section 7 – Summary Offences Ordinance |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; courtroom artists are not permitted to sketch proceedings while in court and must create sketches from memory or notes after leaving the courtroom.&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

Courtroom artists can quickly capture a moment on paper and then sell their work to media outlets who would otherwise be denied a visual record of the trial. They may be paid per sketch or on a [[per diem]] commission. Sketches are often sold to television stations, newswire services, newspapers, or the subjects of a sketch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=As courtroom sketch artist, she's the people's witness |date=23 February 2009 |publisher=New York Daily News |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/courtroom-sketch-artist-people-witness-article-1.307429 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courtroom sketches may also be acquired by institutional archives. The entire set of courtroom sketches related to the [[Lindy Chamberlain]] trial were purchased by the [[National Museum of Australia]] from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Courtroom drawings sketch Chamberlain's history |author=Anna Morozow |date=25 July 2011 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-07-25/chamberlain-court-sketches-go-on-display/2808280 |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selected works of American court artists Richard Tomlinson and Elizabeth Williams are held at the Lloyd Sealy Library at the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]].&lt;ref name=cuny&gt;{{cite web |title=Classified Information the Lloyd Sealy Library Newsletter |date=Spring 2012 |url=http://www.lib.jjay.cuny.edu/newsletter/spring2012/Spring2012.pdf |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other collections of courtroom art include the works of [[Howard Brodie]] held in the [[Library of Congress]]&lt;ref name=loc/&gt; and the Collection of the Supreme Court of the United States, which holds selected court artwork from artist Aggie Kenny.&lt;ref name=illustratedcourtroom/&gt;

A courtroom artist must work quickly, particularly during [[arraignment]] hearings where a witness may appear in court for only a few minutes. A television-ready illustration can be produced in that time, and viewed on television after a court proceeding is finished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sakai |first=Mike |title=Courtroom sketch artist in Loughner case says eyes tell the story |date=16 January 2011 |publisher=East Valley Tribune |url=http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/arizona/article_6bb05b78-202c-11e0-b4df-001cc4c03286.html |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Courtroom artists can be barred from drawing alleged victims of sexual abuse, minors, and jurors or some witnesses in high-profile trials.&lt;ref name=illustratedcourtroom /&gt;

==In the United States==
[[File:Katy Metz cross examined.jpg|thumb|An 1889 courtroom sketch from the trial of ex-[[Alderman]] Thomas Cleary, which was published in ''[[The New York Times]]''.]]
Courtroom sketches in the United States date back as far as the 19th century. Courtroom sketch artists were present for the trial of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and the impeachment of [[Andrew Johnson]].&lt;ref name=coveringcourts&gt;{{cite book |last1=Giles |first1=Robert H. |last2=Snyder |first2=Robert W |title=Covering the courts: free press, fair trials &amp; journalistic performance |year=1999 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-0-7658-0462-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=syracuse&gt;{{cite web |title=Contemporary Courtroom Artists |publisher=Syracuse University |url=http://suart.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/1976-Contemporary-Courtroom-Artists.pdf |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, there were well-known court artists and [[printmaker]]s such as [[George Caleb Bingham]] and David G. Blyth. Sketches during this era were reproduced as engravings in print publications, because photography was not a practical option for courtroom news coverage.&lt;ref name=coveringcourts /&gt;

As mass media technology advanced in the early twentieth century, courts began experimenting with allowing photography and radio broadcasts of court proceedings. Following the media "circus" surrounding the trial of [[Richard Hauptmann|Richard Bruno Hauptmann]] for the [[Lindbergh kidnapping]], broadcasts from federal courtrooms were banned by Rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.&lt;ref name=setonhall&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sarner |first=Joshua |date=Summer 2000 |title=Comment: Justice, Take Two: The Continuing Debate over Cameras in the Courtroom|journal=Seton Hall Constitutional Law Journal |publisher=Seton Hall University |volume=10 |issue= |pages=1053–1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[American Bar Association]] adopted Judicial Canon 35, which prohibited the use of motion or still [[cameras in the courtroom]] and was codified into law by the majority of states.&lt;ref name=setonhall /&gt; On the other hand, no state or federal court prohibited the publication of courtroom sketches and courtroom sketch artistry continued.&lt;ref name=usvcbs&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States of America v.

In 1973, courtroom artist Aggie Whelan (Kenny) was hired by [[CBS]] to illustrate the [[Gainesville Eight]] trial.&lt;ref name=usvcbs /&gt; The judge presiding over the trial, [[Winston E. Arnow]], ordered that no sketches were to be made in the courtroom and that no sketches of the trial be published, even if those sketches were made outside of the court from memory.&lt;ref name=usvcbs /&gt; In the United States v. Columbia Broadcasting System (1974), the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit of Appeals]] overruled the trial judge's order and protected Aggie Whelan's right to create sketches and CBS's right to broadcast courtroom sketches.&lt;ref name=newengland&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first=Mark C. |date=1974 |title=United States v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.: Courtroom Sketching and the Right to Fair Trial |journal=New England Law Review |publisher=New England School of Law |volume=10 |issue= |pages=541–559}}&lt;/ref&gt; The restrictions were too broad and violated both CBS and Whelan's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights.&lt;ref name=usvcbs /&gt;

Television networks began using sketches to illustrate courtroom events during news broadcasts in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=illustratedcourtroom /&gt;&lt;ref name=newengland /&gt; As long as the artist arrived on time, and did not disturb the proceedings by making unnecessary noise, their presence was rarely challenged in most jurisdictions.&lt;ref name=newengland /&gt; In jurisdictions where artists were restricted from sketching inside the courtroom, they created sketches from memory.&lt;ref name=coveringcourts /&gt; Courtroom artists including Ida Libby Dengrove protested these restrictions, and gradually courtrooms began allowing sketch artists to work during trials whilst seated in the public gallery.&lt;ref name=coveringcourts /&gt;

The reintroduction of camera into courtrooms has been credited with a decline in courtroom sketch artists.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |title=Artists Brace for Entry Of Cameras Into Courts |date=29 November 1987 |work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/29/nyregion/artists-brace-for-entry-of-cameras-into-courts.html |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boston&gt;{{cite news |title=Need for courtroom artists fade as cameras move in |author=Michael Tarm |date=28 January 2012 |publisher=Associated Press |url=http://www.boston.com/yourtown/salem/articles/2012/01/28/need_for_courtroom_artists_fade_as_cameras_move_in/ |accessdate=25 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1987, courtroom photography was allowed in 44 states.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; While the creation of [[Court tv#As Court TV|Court TV]] and the [[O.

[[File:20150319-OC-LSC-0194 (16682627630).jpg|thumb|upright|A culinary student at [[Gwinnett Technical College]] in [[Lawrenceville, Georgia]], 2015]]
'''Culinary arts''', in which ''[[wikt:culinary|culinary]]'' means "related to [[cooking]]", are the arts of preparation, cooking and presentation of [[food]], usually in the form of [[meal]]s. People working in this field&amp;nbsp;– especially in establishments such as [[restaurant]]s&amp;nbsp;– are commonly called "[[chef]]s" or "[[Cook (profession)|cooks]]", although, at its most general, the terms "culinary artist" and "[[wikt:Culinarian|culinarian]]" are also used. [[Table manners]] ("the table arts") are sometimes referred to as a culinary art.

Expert Culinarians are required to have knowledge of [[food science]], [[nutrition]] and [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] and are responsible for preparing meals that are as pleasing to the eye as well as to the [[palate]]. After restaurants, their primary places of work include [[delicatessen]]s and relatively large institutions such as hotels and hospitals.

==Origins==
The Culinary Arts, in the [[Western world]], as a craft and later as a field of study, began to evolve at the end of the [[Renaissance]] period. Prior to this, chefs worked in castles, cooking for kings and queens, as well as their families, guests, and other workers of the castle. As [[Monarchy|Monarchical rule]] became phased out as a modality, the chefs took their craft to [[hotel|inns and hotels]]. From here, the craft evolved into a field of study. 

A great deal of the study of Culinary Arts in Europe was organized by [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]], a man famous for his quote "Tell me what you eat, and I will tell you what you are," which has since been mistranslated and oversimplified into "You are what you eat." Other people helped to parse out the different parts of food science and gastronomy. Over time, increasingly deeper and more detailed studies into foods and the Culinary Arts has led to a greater wealth of knowledge.

In Asia, a similar path led to a separate study of the Culinary Arts, which later essentially merged with the Western counterpart. In the modern international marketplace, there is no longer a distinct divide between Western and Eastern foods. Culinary Arts students today, generally speaking, are introduced to the different cuisines of many different cultures from around the world. 

Today, there are thousands of Culinary Arts schools around the world. Additionally, most universities, as well as many smaller tertiary schools like community colleges, offer some type of Culinary Arts Degree, which is technically a Bachelor of Arts Degree. 

==Professional study==
Modern Culinary Arts students study many different aspects of food. Specific areas of study include butchery, chemistry and thermodynamics, visual presentation, food safety, human nutrition and physiology, international history, the manufacture of food items (such as the milling of wheat into flour or the refining of cane plants into crystalline sucrose), and many others. 

Training in culinary arts is possible in most countries around the world. Usually at tertiary level (university). With institutions government funded, privately funded or commercial.

It can be used to refer to a philosophy, methodology or community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Harlow|first=Megan Jean|date=2013|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-multimedia-encyclopedia-of-women-in-todays-world-2013/n94.xml|pages=430–433|edition=2|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781452270388.n94|access-date=2018-07-31|title=The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|isbn=9781452270388|chapter=Cyberfeminism}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined in the early [[1990s]] to describe the work of feminists interested in theorizing, critiquing, exploring and re-making the Internet, cyberspace and new-media technologies in general. The foundational catalyst for the formation of cyberfeminist thought is attributed to [[Donna Haraway]]'s [[A Cyborg Manifesto|The Cyborg Manifesto]], third wave feminism, post-structuralist feminism, riot grrrl culture and the [[Feminist theory|feminist]] critique of the blatant erasure of women within discussions of technology.

==Definition==
Cyberfeminism is a sort of alliance that wants to defy any sort of boundaries of identity and definition and rather be truly postmodern in its potential for radical openness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Harlow|first=Megan Jean|date=2013|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/the-multimedia-encyclopedia-of-women-in-todays-world-2013/n94.xml|pages=430–433|edition=2|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781452270388.n94|access-date=2018-07-31|title=The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World|isbn=9781452270388|chapter=Cyberfeminism}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen with the 1997 Old Boys Network's''100 anti-theses'' which lists the 100 ways "cyberfeminism is not."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obn.org/inhalt_index.html|title=old boys network|website=obn.org|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornelia Sollfrank from the Old Boys Network states that: 
"Cyberfeminism is a myth. A myth is a story of unidentifiable origin, or of different origins. A myth is based on one central story which is retold over and over in different variations. A [[myth]] denies one history as well as one truth, and implies a search for truth in the spaces, in the differences between the different stories. Speaking about Cyberfeminism as a myth, is not intended to mystify it, it simply indicates that Cyberfeminism only exists in plural."&lt;ref name="constantvzw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obn.org/reading_room/writings/html/truth.html|title=The truth about cyberfeminism|last=Sollfrank|first=Cornelia|website=obn.org|publisher=The Old Boys Network}}

[[Mia Consalvo]] defines cyberfeminism as: 
# a label for women—especially young women who might not even want to align with feminism's history—not just to consume new technologies but to actively participate in their making; 
# a critical engagement with new technologies and their entanglement with power structures and systemic oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|date=2003|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/newmedia/n57.xml|pages=108–109|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412950657.n57|access-date=2018-07-31|title=Encyclopedia of New Media|isbn=9780761923824|chapter=Cyberfeminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant cyberfeminist perspective takes a [[utopia]]n view of cyberspace and the Internet as a means of freedom from [[social construct]]s such as [[gender]], sex difference and race. It also sees technology as a means to link the body with machines. [[VNS Matrix]] member, [[Julianne Pierce]] defines cyberfeminism: "In 1991, in a cozy Australian city called Adelaide, four bored girls decided to have some fun with art and French Feminist theory…with homage to [[Donna Haraway]] they began to play around with the idea of cyberfeminism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=First Cyberfeminist International|last=Sollfrank|first=Cornelia|publisher=obn|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors Hawthorne and Klein explain the different analyses of cyberfeminism in their book: "Just as there are liberal, socialist, radical and postmodern feminists, so too one finds these positions reflected in the interpretations of cyberfeminism."&lt;ref name="Hawthorn"&gt;{{citation|last1=Hawthorne|first1=Susan|title=Cyberfeminism: connectivity, critique and creativity|page=4|year=1999|postscript=.|editor-last1=Hawthorne|editor-first1=Susan|contribution=Introduction|location=North Melbourne|publisher=Spinifex Press|isbn=9781875559688|ref=harv|last2=Klein|first2=Renate D.|editor-last2=Klein|editor-first2=Renate D.}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=NT5F5DabEc0C&amp;pg=PA4 Preview.]

== Theoretical Background ==
Cyberfeminism arose partly as a reaction to "the pessimism of the 1980s feminist approaches that stressed the inherently masculine nature of techno-science", a counter movement against the 'toys for boys' perception of new Internet technologies. As cyberfeminist artist [[Faith Wilding]] argued: "If feminism is to be adequate to its cyberpotential then it must mutate to keep up with the shifting complexities of social realities and life conditions as they are changed by the profound impact communications technologies and techno science have on all our lives. It is up to cyberfeminists to use feminist theoretical insights and strategic tools and join them with cybertechniques to battle the very real sexism, racism, and militarism encoded in the software and hardware of the Net, thus politicizing this environment."

[[Donna Haraway]] is the inspiration and genesis for cyberfeminism with her 1985 essay "[[A Cyborg Manifesto|A Cyborg Manifesto: Science, Technology, and Socialist-Feminism in the Late Twentieth Century]]" which was reprinted in ''Simians, Cyborgs and Women: The Reinvention of Nature'' (1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/42579667|title=Cybersexualities : a reader on feminist theory, cyborgs, and cyberspace|date=1999|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|others=Wolmark, Jenny.|isbn=978-0748611171|location=Edinburgh|oclc=42579667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haraway's essay states that cyborgs are able to transcend the public and private spheres, but they do not have the ability to identify with their origins or with nature in order to develop a sense of understanding through differences between self and others. Haraway states that the cyborg "has no truck with pre-oedipal symbiosis, unalienated labor, or other seductions to organic wholeness through a final appropriation of all powers of the parts into a higher unity."

Cyberfeminism is considered a predecessor to [[networked feminism]].  Cyberfeminism also has a relationship to the field of [[Feminist technoscience|feminist science and technology studies]].

British cultural theorist Sadie Plant chose cyberfeminism to describe her recipe for defining the feminizing influence of technology on western society and its inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/814233726|title=The most radical gesture : the Situationist International in a postmodern age|last=1964-|first=Plant, Sadie,|date=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415062213|oclc=814233726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Timeline ==

=== 1990s ===

The term cyberfeminism first came about in 1992, according to Carolyn Guertin, "at a particular moment in time, 1992, simultaneously at three different points on the globe." In [[Canada]], [[Nancy Paterson (artist)|Nancy Paterson]] wrote an article entitled "Cyberfeminism" for [[EchoNYC]].

In Adelaide, [[Australia]], a four-person collective called [[VNS Matrix]] wrote the Cyberfeminist [[Manifesto]] and used the term to label their radical feminist acts "to insert women, bodily fluids and political consciousness into electronic spaces." That same year, British [[cultural theorist]] [[Sadie Plant]] used the term to describe definition of the feminizing influence of [[technology]] on [[western society]]. Guertin goes on to say that the first Cyberfeminist International, organized by the Old Boys Network in [[Germany]], in 1997, refused to define the school of thought, but drafted the "100 Anti-Theses of Cyberfeminism" instead. Guertin says that Cyberfeminism is a celebration of [[Multiplicity (philosophy)|multiplicity]].

In 1996, a special volume of ''Women &amp; Performance'' was devoted to sexuality and cyberspace. It was a compendium of essays on cybersex, online stalking, fetal imaging, and going digital in [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rwap20/9/1?nav=tocList|title=https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rwap20/9/1?nav=tocList|website=tandfonline.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s ===

In 2003 the feminist anthology ''[[Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium]]'' was published; it includes the essay "Cyberfeminism: Networking the Net" by [[Amy Richards]] and [[Marianne Schnall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/51854519|title=Sisterhood is forever : the women's anthology for a new millennium|last=1941-|first=Morgan, Robin,|date=2003|publisher=Washington Square Press|isbn=978-0743466271|oclc=51854519}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010s ===

Usage of the term cyberfeminism has faded away after the millennium, partly as a result of the dot.com bubble burst that bruised the utopian bent of much of digital culture. [[Radhika Gajjala]] and Yeon Ju Oh's ''Cyberfeminism 2.0'' argues that cyberfeminism in the 21st century has taken many new forms and focuses on the different aspects of women's participation online. They find cyberfeminists in women's blogging networks and their conferences, in women's gaming, in fandom, in social media, in online mothers' groups performing pro-breastfeeding activism, and in online spaces developed and populated by marginal networks of women in non-Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/752472588|title=Cyberfeminism 2.0|date=2012|publisher=Peter Lang Pub|others=Gajjala, Radhika, 1960-, Oh, Yeon Ju.|isbn=9781433113598|location=New York|oclc=752472588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist action and activism online is prevalent, especially by women of colour, but has taken on different intersectional terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuntsman|first=Adi|last2=Al-Qasimi|first2=Noor|date=2012-08-15|title=Introduction|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/483264|journal=Journal of Middle East Women's Studies|language=en|volume=8|issue=3|pages=1–13|issn=1558-9579}}&lt;/ref&gt;[https://www.wildmysticwoman.com/] While there are writing on black cyberfeminism which argue that not only is race not absent in our use of the internet, but race is a key component in how we interact with the internet,.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daniels|first=Jessie|date=2009|title=Rethinking Cyberfeminism(s): Race, Gender, and Embodiment|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=37|issue=1/2|pages=101–124|jstor=27655141}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women of colour generally do not associate with cyberfeminism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://osf.io/vnvh9|title=Black Cyberfeminism: Ways Forward for Classification Situations, Intersectionality and Digital Sociology|last=Cottom|first=Tressie McMillan|authorlink=Tressie McMillan Cottom|date=2016-12-07|doi=10.31235/osf.io/vnvh9|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and rather re-frame afrofuturism in feminist terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=Susana M.|date=2013|title=Black Girls Are from the Future: Afrofuturist Feminism in Octavia E.

[http://xenofeminism.org/ Xenofeminism] is an offshoot of cyberfeminism that came into existence through a collective that calls themselves Laboria Cuboniks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/992779765|title=Xenofeminism|last=1983-|first=Hester, Helen,|isbn=9781509520626|location=Cambridge|oclc=992779765|date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their manifesto,  ''Xenofeminism: A Politics for Alienation'', it argues against nature as natural and immutable for a future where all identities are non-binary and in which feminism destabilizes and uses the master's tools for their own rebuilding of life: "Xenofeminism is [[gender]]-abolitionist.  'Gender abolitionism' is shorthand for the ambition to construct a society where traits currently assembled under the rubric of gender, no longer furnish a grid for the asymmetric operation of power.  'Race abolitionism' expands into a similar formula -- that the struggle must continue until currently racialized characteristics are no more a basis of discrimination than the color of one's eyes.  Ultimately, every emancipatory abolitionism must incline towards the horizon of class abolitionism, since it is in capitalism where we encounter oppression in its transparent, denaturalized form: you're not exploited or oppressed because you are a wage labourer or poor; you are a labourer or poor because you are exploited."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://xenofeminism.org/manifesto|title=Xenofeminist Manifesto - xenofeminism|work=xenofeminism|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decline in volume of cyberfeminist literature in recent years would suggest that cyberfeminism has somewhat lost momentum as a movement, however, in terms of artists and artworks, not only cyberfeminism is still taking place, but its artistic and theoretical contribution has been of crucial importance to the development of [[posthuman]] aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olszanowski|first=Magdalena|date=2014-04-03|title=Feminist Self-Imaging and Instagram: Tactics of Circumventing Sensorship|journal=Visual Communication Quarterly|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=83–95|doi=10.1080/15551393.2014.928154|issn=1555-1393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critiques ==
Many critiques of cyberfeminism have focused on its lack of intersectional focus, its utopian vision of cyberspace, especially cyberstalking and cyber-abuse,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilbert|first=Pamela|date=1996-01|title=On sex, cyberspace, and being stalked|journal=Women &amp; Performance: A Journal of Feminist Theory|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=125–149|doi=10.1080/07407709608571254|issn=0740-770X}}&lt;/ref&gt; its whiteness and elite community building.

One of the major critiques of cyberfeminism, especially as it was in its heyday in the 1990s, was that it required economic privilege to get online: "By all means let [poor women] have access to the Internet, just as all of us have it—like chocolate cake or AIDS," writes activist Annapurna Mamidipudi. "Just let it not be pushed down their throats as 'empowering.' Otherwise this too will go the way of all imposed technology and achieve the exact opposite of what it purports to do."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Senft|first=Theresa M.|date=2003|url=http://sk.sagepub.com/reference/newmedia/n105.xml|pages=202–205|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|doi=10.4135/9781412950657.n105|access-date=2018-08-02|title=Encyclopedia of New Media|isbn=9780761923824|chapter=Gender and New Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberfeminist artist and thinker [[Faith Wilding]] also critiques its utopian vision for not doing the tough work of technical, theoretical and political education.

== Art &amp; Artists ==
The practice of cyberfeminist art is inextricably intertwined with cyberfeminist theory. The 100 anti-theses make clear that cyberfeminism is not just about theory, while theory is extremely important, cyberfeminism requires participation. As one member of the cyberfeminist collective the Old Boys Network&lt;ref name="OBN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obn.org/|title=Home page|website=obn.org|publisher=Old Boys Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; writes, cyberfeminism is "linked to aesthetic and ironic strategies as intrinsic tools within the growing importance of design and [[aesthetics]] in the new world order of flowing pancapitalism".&lt;ref name="constantvzw.com2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obn.org/reading_room/writings/html/truth.html|title=The truth about cyberfeminism|last=Sollfrank|first=Cornelia|website=obn.org|publisher=The Old Boys Network}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Cyberfeminism also has strong connections with the DIY feminism movement, as noted in the seminal text ''DIY Feminism'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=DIY feminism|last=Bail|first=Kathy|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=1996|isbn=9781864482317|location=St Leonards, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; a grass roots movement that encourages active participation, especially as a solo practitioner or a small collective.

Around the late nineties several cyberfeminist artists and theorists gained a measure of recognition for their works, including the above-mentioned [[VNS Matrix]] and their Cyberfeminist Manifesto for the 21st century,&lt;ref name="Pierce"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Julianne|date=1998|title=info heavy cyber babe|url=http://www.obn.org/obn_pro/downloads/reader1.pdf|journal=First Cyberfeminist International|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208064706/http://www.obn.org/obn_pro/downloads/reader1.pdf|archive-date=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Faith Wilding]] and [[Critical Art Ensemble]]. Some of the better-known examples of cyberfeminist work include [[Auriea Harvey &amp; Michaël Samyn|Auriea Harvey]]'s work, [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone,]] [[Linda Dement]]'s ''Cyberflesh Girlmonster''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindadement.com/cyberflesh-girlmonster.htm|title=Cyberflesh Girlmonster 1995|last=Dement|first=Linda|website=lindadement.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women's body parts and remixes them to create new monstrous yet beautiful shapes; [[Melinda Rackham]]'s ''Carrier,'' a work of web-based multimedia art that explores the relationship between humans and infectious agents;,&lt;ref name="barnett"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barnett|first=Tully|date=July 2014|title=Monstrous agents: cyberfeminist media and activism|url=http://adanewmedia.org/2014/07/issue5-barnett/|journal=[[Ada: A Journal of Gender, New Media &amp; Technology]]|volume=5|postscript=.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shu Lea Cheang]]'s 1998 work ''Brandon,'' which was the first Internet based artwork to be commissioned and collected by the Guggenheim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/15337|title=Review of ''Brandon'' 1998–99, by Shu Lea Cheang|last=Jones|first=Caitlin|publisher=Guggenheim Museum|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420091516/http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/15337|archive-date=20 April 2016|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later work of Cheang's, [[I.K.U.]] (2001), is a sci-fi pornographic film that imagines a cybersexual post-Blade Runner universe, where sexual encounters with feminine, shapeshifting [[Replicant|"replicants"]] are distilled and collected for resale, and ultimately reuse.

The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips. Recent artworks of note include Evelin Stermitz's ''World of Female Avatars'' in which the artist has collected quotes and images from women over the world and displayed them in an interactive browser based format, and Regina Pinto's ''Many Faces of Eve''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stermitz|first=Evelin|date=2008-10-23|title=World of Female Avatars: An Artistic Online Survey on the Female Body in Times of Virtual Reality|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/251322|journal=Leonardo|language=en|volume=41|issue=5|pages=538–539|issn=1530-9282}}&lt;/ref&gt; O[rphan] D[frift&gt;] (1994-2003) were a 4.5 person collective experimenting with writing, art, music and the internet's potential "treating information as matter and the image as a unit of contagion."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://monoskop.org/Orphan_Drift|title=Orphan Drift - Monoskop|website=monoskop.org|language=en|access-date=2018-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Listserves==
An important part of the generation of cyberfeminist theory and critique was the emergence of a few critical listserves that served as the basis for the organization of three international cyberfeminist events and several major publications.
{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* [[Nettime]] - More broadly situated in new media theory the nettime listserve became a site for the discussion, performance, and arbitration of cyberfeminist theory in 1997.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}
* FACES - The FACES-l.net mailing list started in the spring of 1997 partly out of a series of concurrent dinner conversations known as the Face Settings Project.  The initial goal of the project was to bring together women working in the intersections of art, media to share their work and to counter the lack of women's work presented at international festivals.  Faces-l was created as a means for the artists, curators, djs, designers, activists, programmers, and technologists meeting at festivals to share their work and discuss gender and media with an international community of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |   title = FACES story | url = http://faces-l.net/en/content/faces-storyhtml.html | accessdate = February 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''East European Comic Con''' is a [[speculative fiction]] [[Fan convention]] held annually in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]. It is East Europe's most important event dedicated to fans of comics, animations, video games, as well as TV series and movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comic Con - the largest comic salon in the world, arrives in Bucharest next year |author= |url=http://adevarul.ro/news/bucuresti/comic-con--mai-mare-salon-banda-desenata-lume-ajunge-bucuresti-anul-viitor-1_50cf146c596d7200910d3d5a/index.html |newspaper=Adevarul |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==

Visitors are able to attend and take part in contests, video screenings and special sessions with movie and comics celebrities, as well as purchase products specific for this type of event.

The most well-known contests are the [[Cosplay]] costume contest and a Quiz contest. The Cosplay costume contest has participants performing a short play while wearing the costume of a character from a comic, video game, animation or movie, while they imitate the character's gestures and behaviors. The quiz contest is focused on [[anime]], [[manga]], TV series, comics and video games. An important part of the event is represented by the PC and console video game exhibitors and competitions. EECC is the largest gaming event in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The most important event for Comics fans - Comic Con - Bucharest |author= |url=http://www.mediafax.ro/life-inedit/cel-mai-important-eveniment-dedicat-pasionatilor-de-benzi-desenate-comic-con-la-bucuresti-10396311 |newspaper=Mediafax |date=17 December 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

East European Comic Con started in the spring of 2013. At its first edition, EECC successfully gathered more than 9,000 “geeks”. It opened the door to some fruitful partnerships and friendships. For two days, fans could participate in a Cosplay contest, LOL Contest, Quiz Contest or Illustration contest, and they could talk to artists or see a different side of their favorite actors. Victor Drujiniu – artist for DC Comics and Dark House, and Remus Brezeanu – the artist of The End of Times of Bram&amp;Ben, and Puiu Manu – one of the best Romanian comics artist, were some of the 22 artists present at EECC 2013.

'''Fieldnotes''' refer to [[Qualitative property|qualitative]] notes recorded by [[scientist]]s or researchers in the course of [[field research]], during or after their [[observation]] of a specific [[phenomenon]] they are studying. The notes are intended to be read as evidence that gives meaning and aids in the understanding of the phenomenon. Fieldnotes allow the researcher to access the subject and record what they observe in an unobtrusive manner.

One major disadvantage of taking fieldnotes is that they are recorded by an observer and are thus subject to (a) memory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Notes on Science &amp; Nature|last=Canfield|first=Michael|publisher=Harvard University Pres|year=2011|isbn=9780674057579|location=|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (b) possibly, the conscious or unconscious [[Confirmation bias|bias]] of the observer.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} It is best to record fieldnotes immediately after leaving the site to avoid forgetting important details.

Fieldnotes are particularly valued in descriptive sciences such as [[ethnography]], [[biology]], [[geology]], and [[archaeology]], each of which have long traditions in this area.

== Structure ==
There are two components of fieldnotes: descriptive information and reflective information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/fieldnotes|title=Research Guides: Organizing Your Social Sciences Research Paper: Writing Field Notes|last=Labaree|first=Robert V.|website=libguides.usc.edu|language=en|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptive information is factual data that is being recorded. Factual data includes time and date, the state of the physical setting, social environment, descriptions of the subjects being studied and their roles in the setting, and the impact that the observer may have had on the environment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Reflective information is the observer's reflections about the observation being conducted. These reflections are ideas, questions, concerns, and other related thoughts.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Fieldnotes can also include sketches, diagrams, and other drawings. Visually capturing a phenomenon requires the observer to pay more attention to every detail as to not overlook anything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Field Notes on Science &amp; Nature|last=Canfield|first=Michael|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2011|isbn=9780674057579|location=|pages=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alison Carroll 6.jpg|thumb|Video game heroine [[Lara Croft]], here portrayed by [[Alison Carroll]], is a common example cited for the [[sexual objectification]] of women in games.]]

The portrayal of men and women in [[video games]], as in other media, is a subject of research in [[gender studies]] and is discussed in the context of [[sexism in video gaming]].

Although women make up about half of video game players, they are significantly underrepresented as characters in mainstream games, despite the prominence of iconic heroines such as [[Samus Aran]] or [[Lara Croft]]. The portrayal of women in games often reflects traditional [[gender role]]s, [[sexual objectification]] or negative stereotypes, such as that of the "[[damsel in distress]]". Male characters are often stereotypically depicted as big and muscular, and [[LGBT]] characters have been slow to appear in video games as a result of the [[heteronormativity]] of the medium.

Research indicates that how genders are portrayed in games can influence players' perception of gender roles, and that young girls prefer to play a character of their own gender much more than boys do. On average, female-led games sell fewer copies than male-led ones, but also have lower marketing budgets.

A 2008 Gallup poll indicated that half of all American video game players were women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

"Teens, Video Games and Civics." Pew Research Center: Internet, Science &amp; Tech. N.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both men and women play video games, but studies suggest differences in platform and game genre preference.&lt;ref name=Joystiq&gt;{{cite web|title=LReport: Men play more MMOs, FPSes; women rule mobile, RPG|author=Jessica Conditt|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2014/10/27/report-men-play-more-mmos-fpses-women-rule-mobile-rpg|publisher=[[Joystiq]]|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Entertainment Software Rating Board reports that in 2010, 80% of female console gamers played on Wii, 11% on Xbox360 and 9% on PS3. By comparison, 38% of male console gamers in the year 2014 played Xbox 360, 41% played Wii and 21% played PS3.&lt;ref name="Video Game Stats"&gt;{{cite web|title=How Much Do You Know About Video Games?|author=ESRB|url=http://www.esrb.org/about/video-game-industry-statistics.jsp|accessdate=2014-11-09|date=2014-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study by [[Flurry (company)|Flurry]] looked at the different mobile gaming preferences between men and women. Women made up 60–80% of the solitaire, slots, social turn-based, match-three / bubble-shooter, management / simulation and quiz game markets. Men on the other hand, made up between 60–80% of the strategy, shooter, card battle, racing and action RPG markets.&lt;ref name="Furry App statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Love, Courtship and the Promiscuous Male Mobile Gamer |author=Dan Laughlin |url=http://www.flurry.com/bid/95605/Love-Courtship-and-the-Promiscuous-Male-Mobile-Gamer#.VIl21DGUfjU=2014-11-09 |date=2014-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022125905/http://www.flurry.com/bid/95605/Love-Courtship-and-the-Promiscuous-Male-Mobile-Gamer |archivedate=2014-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 SuperData Research study found that men and women enjoy video games, but some genres are attracting one gender more than the other: Women compose 57.8 percent of the mobile market, 53.6 percent of the RPG market and 50.2 percent of the PC market (including social games). The study found that men make up 66 percent of MMO players, 66 percent of FPS players and 63 percent of digital console players.&lt;ref name="Joystiq"/&gt; {{Clear}}

===As player characters===

====Prevalence====
Playable female characters were found to appear less frequently than male characters in reviews for popular games in a 2006 study from [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Ivory, J. D. (2006). [http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jivory/JIvory2006MassCommunicationandSociety.pdf Still a man's game: Gender representation in online reviews of video games.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224015022/http://filebox.vt.edu/users/jivory/JIvory2006MassCommunicationandSociety.pdf |date=2014-12-24 }} Mass Communication &amp; Society, 9(1), 103-114. The sample of reviews was taken from the "Top Rated" and "Most Popular" lists from [[GameSpot]] on March 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M. K., &amp; Summers, A. (2007). [http://www.easternct.edu/~lugow/courses/videogames/gender_videogames.pdf Gender differences in video game characters' roles, appearances, and attire as portrayed in video game magazines.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101083815/http://www.easternct.edu/~lugow/courses/videogames/gender_videogames.pdf |date=2015-01-01 }} Sex roles, 57(9-10), 733-742.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study by Melinda C. R. Burgess et al. found that men are featured much more often than women on the covers of console video games.&lt;ref name=Burgess&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burgess|first=Melinda C. R. |author2=Steven Paul Stermer |author3=Stephen R. Burgess|title=Sex, Lies, and Video Games: The Portrayal of Male and Female Characters on Video Game Covers|journal=Sex Roles|date=30 June 2007|pages=419–433|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9250-0|volume=57|issue=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a sample of 669 action, shooter, and role-playing games selected by EEDAR in 2012, 300 (45%) provided the option of playing as a female, but only 24 (4%) had an exclusively female protagonist. EEDAR found in 2010 that 10% of games had a protagonist with an indiscernible gender.&lt;ref name="escapistEEDAR"/&gt;

According to Madeline Messer writing in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 2015, among the top 50 [[Platform game#Endless running game|endless running]] games for mobile devices, 98% of those with gender-identifiable characters featured male protagonists, of which 90% were free to play. Only 46% of these games offered female characters, and only 15% offered them for free. Playing as a girl required, on average, an additional purchase of $7.53, much more than the games themselves cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Messer|first1=Madeline|title=I’m a 12-year-old girl. Why don’t the characters in my apps look like me?|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/03/04/im-a-12-year-old-girl-why-dont-the-characters-in-my-apps-look-like-me/|accessdate=12 April 2015|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Evolution====
[[Samus Aran]], the heroine of ''[[Metroid (video game)|Metroid]]'' (1986) and its successors, is often cited as "the first playable human female character in a mainstream video game".&lt;ref name="Guinness2013"&gt;{{cite book | title=Guinness World Records 2013: Gamer's Edition | publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd | authorlink=Feature: Girl Power-Up | year=2012 | page=154 | isbn=9781904994954}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other earlier games featured female player characters, such as Toby Masuyo ("Kissy") from ''[[Baraduke]]'' (1985) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/namcoxcapcom/namcoxcapcom2.htm#tobymasuyo | title=Obscure Namco characters | publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Kurt Kalata}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2009/10/nintendo_download_13_14_october_2009_japan | title=Nintendo Download: 13-14 October 2009 (Japan) | publisher=nintendolife.com | accessdate=6 October 2013 | author=Sean Aaron}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Kurumi-Hime from ''[[Sega Ninja]]'' (1985). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/ninja-princess/ | title=Ninja Princess | publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 | accessdate=12 September 2017 | author=Sam Derboo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies of the prevalence of female characters in video games began to be conducted in sociological, educational, and cultural journals as early as the late 1970s and early 1980s. In 1979, researchers publishing in ''Psychological Record'' (Vol.29, No.1. Pp.&amp;nbsp;43–48) concluded from the results of a 201-person survey that 90% of male subjects and 85% of female subjects perceived the computer as masculine (in gameplay versus the computer).&lt;ref name=leroux&gt;Leroux, Yvan and Michel Pépin. "Jeu Sur Micro-Ordinateur et Différences Liées au Sexe". ''Revue des Sciences de l'Education''. Vol.XII, No.2. Pp.173-196. 1986. {{ISSN|0318-479X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, professor [[Sara Kiesler]] et al. published a study in ''[[Psychology Today]]'' (Vol.17, No.3. Pp.&amp;nbsp;40–48.) finding that female characters appeared in video games at a frequency of 1 game in 7.&lt;ref name=leroux/&gt; Elizabeth Behm-Morawitz suggested that the reduced presence of female characters implies a secondary status for women in video games. When playable female characters do appear in video games, they are more often scantily dressed and [[oversexualized]] than men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Effects of the Sexualization of Female Video Game Characters on Gender Stereotyping and Female Self-Concept|date=2009|journal=Sex Roles|volume=61|issue=11|pages=808–823|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9683-8|via=ProQuest|author1=Behm-Morawitz, Elizabeth|author2=Dana Mastro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lara Croft]], the protagonist of ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' (1996), is among the best-known strong, fictional women in a variety of media.&lt;ref name="taylor"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Egenfeldt-Nielsen | first1 = Simon | last2 = Smith | first2 = Jonas Heide | last3 = Pajares Tosca | first3 = Susana | title = Understanding video games: the essential introduction | chapter = Player culture | publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | year = 2008 | page = 163 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=31XHdVXlbt0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=%22april%20ryan%22&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q=%22april%20ryan%22&amp;f=false | accessdate = 2011-07-03 | isbn = 978-0-415-97721-0 | quote = "Helen Kennedy [...] summarizes these arguments, and Lara Croft's ambivalent role as both an action heroine [...], and an eroticized object of the male gaze with a great deal of voyeuristic appeal".}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since her introduction in 1996, the character of Croft has been criticized for her "unrealistic" breast size; Lara was claimed to personify "an ongoing culture clash over gender, sexuality, empowerment, and objectification."&lt;ref name="gettingthegirl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3137700 |author=Zoe Flower |title=Getting the Girl: The myths, misconceptions, and misdemeanors of females in games |publisher=[[1UP.com]] |accessdate=2007-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218083755/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3137700 |archivedate=2007-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 Tomb Raider title, Croft was depicted in "hot pants" and "middriffs" and was said to look like she "was dressed by a male".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tomb Raider Lara Croft now Battling Video Game Sterotypes|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/games/tomb-raider-lara-croft-now-battling-video-game-stereotypes/#/0|website=Hero Comles}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the game's creators maintain that she was not designed with marketing in mind, and have claimed to be rather surprised at her pinup-style adoration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lara Croft, the Bit Girl |author=N'gai Croal and Jane Hughes |publisher=[[Newsweek]] |date=1997-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Tomb Raider: Legend]]'', Lara underwent a radical redesign, ostensibly to make her less sexualized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lara's curves reduced to appeal to female gamers |date=2005-05-21 |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Real-appeal/2005/05/21/1116533572111.html |accessdate=2007-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015084057/http://www.smh.com.au/news/World/Real-appeal/2005/05/21/1116533572111.html |archivedate=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[April Ryan (The Longest Journey)|April Ryan]] from ''[[The Longest Journey]]'' (1999) has been compared to Lara Croft, as she shows less prominent physical feminine attributes than Lara but more feminine psychological traits, as contrasted with Lara's masculine connotations like aggressiveness and force.&lt;ref name="merete"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.csi.ensmp.fr/WebCSI/4S/download/download_page.php?file=lie.pdf | title = Lara Croft and her sisters | accessdate = 2011-07-03 | last = Lie | first = Merete | publisher = Norwegian University of Science and Technology | quote = "She is attractive, but no sex bomb"  "April may, however, appear as more feminine because even if she is tough and brave, she is depicted as both sensitive and vain" | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110929140119/http://www.csi.ensmp.fr/WebCSI/4S/download/download_page.php?file=lie.pdf | archivedate = 2011-09-29 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, [[Jade (Beyond Good &amp; Evil)|Jade]], the protagonist of ''[[Beyond Good &amp; Evil]]'' (2003), was widely recognized as a strong and confident female character lacking any overt sexualisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rougeau|first=Michael|url=http://www.complex.com/video-games/2013/01/the-50-greatest-heroines-in-video-game-history/jade|title=50 Greatest Heroines In Video Game History|publisher=Complex|date=March 4, 2013|accessdate=March 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bayonetta: empowering or exploitative?|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/213466/bayonetta-empowering-or-exploitative/ |publisher=[[GamePro]] |accessdate=2010-01-16|date=2010-01-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109032922/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/213466/bayonetta-empowering-or-exploitative/|archivedate=2010-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year 2013 featured women in leading roles in a number of award-winning games such as ''[[The Last of Us]]'' (2013), ''[[BioShock Infinite|Bioshock Infinite]]'' (2013), the rebooted ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' (2013), and ''[[Beyond: Two Souls]]'' (2013). A study of these games found that although the leading female characters in these games were able to subvert predominant gender stereotypes, women were still limited by men in the narratives, in particular through benevolent sexism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perreault|first=Mildred F.|last2=Perreault|first2=Gregory Pearson|last3=Jenkins|first3=Joy|last4=Morrison|first4=Ariel|date=2016-12-16|title=Depictions of Female Protagonists in Digital Games|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1555412016679584|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|doi=10.1177/1555412016679584}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the developers' choice to omit playable women in the latest iterations of the top-tier gaming franchises ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' and ''[[Far Cry (series)|Far Cry]]'' became a focus of discussions in gaming media. This indicated, according to game industry professionals cited by ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'', a shift in the industry's attention towards issues of diversity in gaming, in conjunction with video games as a whole growing beyond their former core audience of younger men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Crecente|first1=Brian|title=As game players diversify, developers start to rethink the stars of their games|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/6/23/5834628/women-in-video-games-heroines-e3-2014|accessdate=23 June 2014|work=Polygon|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women of color or [[people of color]] as a whole are less likely to be represented by the popular games and more likely to be represented as a stereotype.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender and Racial Stereotypes in Video Games|last=Peng|first=Mou|publisher=IGI Global|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=924}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a higher chance of people of color, especially women, to be portrayed as villains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===As supporting characters===

According to Salzburge Academy on Media and Global Change, in 1981 Nintendo offered game designer Shigeru Miyamoto to create a new video game for the American market. In the game the hero was Mario, and the objective of the game was to rescue a young princess named Peach. Peach was depicted as having a pink dress and blonde hair. The princess was kidnapped and trapped in a castle by the evil villain character Bowser, who is depicted as a turtle. Princess Peach appears in 15 of the main Super Mario games and is kidnapped in 13 of them. The only main games that Peach was not kidnapped in were in the North America release of ''[[Super Mario 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', but she was a character that can be played. Zelda became playable in some later games of the ''Legend of Zelda'' series or had the pattern altered.&lt;ref name="Objectification of Women in Video Games"&gt;[http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/unesco/objectification-women-video-games "Objectification of Women in Video Games"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518004756/http://www.salzburg.umd.edu/unesco/objectification-women-video-games |date=2015-05-18 }}, Retrieved 9 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"In video games, the major stereotyped myths of women are typically the damsel in distress, hyper-sexualized villain (Sylvia Christel from ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]'') and the sexy/strong best friend ([[Tifa Lockhart|Tifa]] from ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''). ... In all of these instances, the female character is, more likely than not, in love with the male protagonist or trying desperately to bang him."&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A number of games feature a female character as an ally or [[sidekick]] to the male hero. Some of them, like [[Ada Wong]] of ''[[Resident Evil]]'' and [[Mona Sax]] of ''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'', were turned into [[player character]]s in later instances of their series.

One of the first major female villains in video games was the [[Dark Queen (Battletoads)|Dark Queen]] in ''[[Battletoads]]'' (1991) and its sequels.&lt;ref&gt;Steven A. Schwartz, Janet Schwartz, ''The Parent's Guide to Video Games'', Prima Pub., 1994 (p.8)&lt;/ref&gt; [[SHODAN]], an artificial intelligence with a female voice and a female face, was the main villain of the game ''[[System Shock]]'' (1994), praised as one of the most recognizable female characters in gaming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/features/tenspot_females/page9.html TenSpot: Ten Best Female Characters].

===Sexualization===
The portrayal of women in video games has been the subject of academic study and controversy since the early 1980s. Recurring themes in articles and discussions on the topic include the [[sexual objectification]] and [[sexualization]] of female characters, done to appeal to a presumed male audience,&lt;ref name="Tremblay2012"/&gt; as well as the degree to which female characters are independent from their male counterparts within the same game. Research on exposure to sexualized media representations of women in television and magazines has asked whether it reduces male compassion toward women, and reduces women's perceptions of their desire and suitability for various vocations.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

====Prevalence====
In their 2005 study, Dill and Thill distinguish three major stereotypical depictions of women in gaming: (1) sexualized, (2) scantily clad, and (3) a vision of beauty. The study revealed that over 80% of women in video games represented one of these depictions. More than one quarter of female characters embodied all of the three stereotypical categories at once. Dill and Thill also note that another prevalent theme with which women were depicted was a combination of aggression and sex, referred to as "eroticized aggression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dill|first=Karen E.|author2=Thill K. P.|title=Video Game Characters and the Socialization of Gender Roles: Young People's Perceptions Mirror Sexist Media Depictions|journal=Sex Roles|year=2007|volume=57|pages=851–864|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to sociology professor and researcher Tracy Dietz, women are often depicted in stereotypical roles that typically pertain to sexuality in which the woman focuses upon beauty/physical attractiveness.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; According to an analysis conducted by Downs and Smith, playable and plot relevant characters in the 60 best selling video games of 2003 were predominantly male. Females who were depicted were frequently sexualized. The female characters analyzed were depicted partially naked or with unrealistic proportions more often than the male characters were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=Edward|last2=Smith|first2=Stacy L.|title=Keeping Abreast of Hypersexuality: A Video Game Character Content Analysis|journal=Sex Roles|date=2 September 2009|volume=62|issue=11-12|pages=721–733|doi=10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-009-9637-1|language=en|issn=0360-0025}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of 225 video game covers found that both male and female character's physiques were over-exaggerated, but women were more "physically altered" (especially in the bust) than their male counterparts, and even more so if the female was the main character of the game.&lt;ref name=Burgess/&gt;

A 2016 study of 571 games released between 1984 and 2014&lt;ref name="Lynch et al. 2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lynch|first1=Teresa|last2=Tompkins|first2=Jessica E.|last3=van Driel|first3=Irene I.|last4=Fritz|first4=Niki|title=Sexy, Strong, and Secondary: A Content Analysis of Female Characters in Video Games across 31 Years|journal=Journal of Communication|date=30 June 2016|doi=10.1111/jcom.12237}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that the sexualization of female characters was at its height between 1990 and 2005, and then began to significantly decline. It also determined that there was no significant difference in sexualization between games rated as "Teen" (for ages 13 and up) and "Mature" (17 and up) by the [[ESRB]], indicating that sexualized women in games are so prevalent that they are not thought of as objectionable to children. Less sexualization was found in [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]], which are played more often by women, than in action and fighting games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Survey of 31 years of video games shows a decline in sexualized female characters|url=http://phys.org/news/2016-07-survey-years-video-games-decline.html|accessdate=31 July 2016|work=[[Phys.org]]|date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DiabloCosplay1.jpg|thumb|left|Women costumed as scantily armored player characters from the video game ''[[Diablo III]]'']]
Many early female video game characters (such as [[Ms. Pac-Man]]) are identical to an existing male character, except for a visual marker of their femininity, such as pink bows, lipstick and long eyelashes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sarkeesian, Anita.

A recurrent representation of [[Women in speculative fiction|women in fantasy setting]]s, originating in the 1960s, is the [[women warriors in literature and culture|female warrior]] dressed in scanty armor.&lt;ref name="Adweek 4 June 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Griner|first=David|title=Will the Fantasy Genre Ever Grow Up and Ditch the Chainmail Bikini?

===Violence against women===
Video games have been criticized for depicting [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://mediareporttowomen.com/issues/311.htm |title=Women's role in popular video games: Stripped down and killed off |journal=Media Report to Women |date=Winter 2003 |page=1 |volume=31 |issue=1 |accessdate=2007-09-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070720072203/http://www.mediareporttowomen.com/issues/311.htm |archivedate=2007-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the 2013 game ''[[Dead Island: Riptide]]'' generated controversy when the special "zombie bait" edition of the game included a statue of a torso of a busty, dismembered woman in a skimpy bikini.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/1/15/3878810/dead-island-riptides-bloody-torso-statue-sparks-anger-shock | title=Dead Island Riptide's bloody torso statue sparks anger, confusion | publisher=Polygon.com | date=January 15, 2013 | accessdate=7 May 2014 | author=Brian Crecente}}&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' franchise has had issues with claims of violence against women,{{Vague|date=October 2018}} [[Rockstar North]]'s ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'' was also surrounded in much criticism; so much so that the sale of it was banned by certain retailers in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Makuch|first1=Eddie|title=GTA 5 "Violence Against Women" Criticisms Spur Ban from Australian Retailers|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-violence-against-women-criticisms-spurs-ban-/1100-6423950/|website=GameSpot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1982 game ''[[Custer's Revenge]]'' was first noted for containing elements of rape and some Native American groups and the [[National Organization for Women]] have criticised this as well as alleged [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/top10/december02/shame/index4.shtml |title=Top Ten Shameful Games: 1.

The 2013 reboot of ''[[Tomb Raider (2013 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' drew controversy when ''[[Kotaku]]'' described it as using rape for Lara Croft's character development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=You'll 'Want To Protect' The New, Less Curvy Lara Croft|url=http://kotaku.com/5917400/youll-want-to-protect-the-new-less-curvy-lara-croft |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developers denied that the scene depicted an attempted rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomb Raider Creators Are No Longer Referring to Game's Attempted 'Rape' Scene As an Attempted Rape Scene|url=http://kotaku.com/5918193/tomb-raider-creators-are-no-longer-referring-to-games-attempted-rape-scene-as-an-attempted-rape-scene |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tomb Raider Creators Say 'Rape' Is Not A Word In Their Vocabulary|url=http://kotaku.com/5922228/tomb-raider-creators-say-rape-is-not-a-word-in-their-vocabulary |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=2013-11-18 |date=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal of men==
Men are also often portrayed stereotypically in games. A recurring depiction of male sexuality is the ''power fantasy,'' where an apparent sexualization as an object of desire and [[hypermasculinity]] are overruled by the character's agency as the protagonist and  avatar for the player’s power within the game world.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2016/04/the-three-modes-of-male-sexuality-in-videogames.html|title=The Three Modes of Male Sexuality in Videogames|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As powerful===
Men in games tend to be shown as muscular and big. For instance, men in video games have chests that are about 2 inches (6%) larger, heads that are about 13 inches bigger, waists that are 5 inches wider, and hips that are 7 inches wider, than in reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Virtual muscularity: a content analysis of male video game characters|date=2011|journal=Body Image|volume=8|issue=1|pages=43–51|vauthors=Martins N, Williams DC, Ratan RA, Harrison K|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2010.10.002|pmid=21093394}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often characterized as overtly aggressive and violent.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Following the releases of ''[[Grand Theft Auto V]]'', the developers were met with criticism regarding both the portrayal of women and torture, but also that of men. Two of the main characters, [[Trevor Philips]] and [[Michael De Santa]], have since been interpreted by some as portraying men as "liars, cheats, bad husbands and fathers, and psychopaths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tassi|first1=Paul|title=On Gender and 'GTA 5'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/09/26/on-gender-and-gta-5/|accessdate=April 24, 2015|publisher=Forbes|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GamesRadar]] writer David Houghton, writing in an article on sexism in video games, was highly critical of many stereotypes that came with male protagonists, outlining them as "the primeval hunter/gatherer type [with] arm-cripplingly ripped biceps, necks too muscley to turn, emotion dials stuck on 'aggressive grimace' and a 50% lack of chest coverings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/are-video-games-really-sexist/?page=2|title=Are video games really sexist?|author=Houghton, David|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]|date=2012-06-23|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamin Warren]] on PBS Game/Show highlighted that video games could promote "unreasonable body expectations, or an inability to express emotion, or the pressure to 'man up' and be a leader". He also highlighted that the vast majority of characters who perform and experience violence in video games are men, while women and children are generally to be protected.&lt;ref name= GameShow&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrActT_7X6U |title=Do Videogame Stereotypes Hurt Men? |accessdate=2014-09-29|date=2013-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As sexualized===
Multiple critics point out the "[[male gaze]]" as the reason why male characters are not overtly sexualized in the same way as female characters are, mentioning the assumption in the video game industry that a majority of [[gamer]]s are heterosexual men, to whom companies cater.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/post/151713-on-mens-sexualization-in-video-games/|title=On Mens Sexualization in Video Games|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dante Douglas of [[Paste (magazine)|''Paste'' magazine]] identifies the "power fantasy" alongside two other stereotypes, men as ''gender performance'' and as ''fan interpretation'':&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* In the interpretation as gender performance under an heteronormative perspective, a male being sexy is seen as an opposite of masculinity. In this view, depictions of males as objects of desire are coded by including feminine traits, vanity and attention to personal attires, or [[queer]] codes, often depicted as humorous.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.your-critic.com/2011/06/gamers-gaze-part-1.html|title=Your Critic is in Another Castle: The Gamer's Gaze, part 1|website=www.your-critic.com|access-date=2016-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bishōnen]] archetype is an example of this portrayal, as well as characters like [[Vega (Street Fighter)|Vega]] from ''Street Fighter'', [[Mettaton]] from ''Undertale,'' [[Maxi (Soulcalibur)|Maxi]] and [[Raphael (Soulcalibur)|Raphael]] from ''Soul Calibur'', and [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]] from ''Final Fantasy VII''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* A different way of sexualizing male characters is that performed by players and fans communities, in particular for characters open to their own emotions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Douglas identifies as traits of these characters the space dedicated in the game to show their personality, shown through their interactions with other characters, and their agency through those interactions rather than pure displays of strength and power. Because of these traits, this category of characters occurs most often with non-player characters.

==Portrayal of LGBT characters==
{{main article|LGBT themes in video games|LGBT characters in video games}}

[[LGBT]] ([[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] or [[transgender]]) characters have been included in video games as early as the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":rated m"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rated M for Mature : Sex and Sexuality in Video Games|last=Wysocki|first=Matthew|last2=Lauteria|first2=Evan W.|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|year=2015|isbn=9781628925760|location=New York, NY|pages=42–57|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there has been a trend towards greater representation of LGBT people in video games, they are frequently identified as LGBT in secondary material, such as comics, rather than in the games themselves.&lt;ref name="Kotaku 4 October 2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dale|first1=Laura Kate|title=The Video Game Characters You Never Knew Were LGBT|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2017/10/04/the-video-game-characters-you-never-knew-were-lgbt|accessdate=8 October 2017|work=[[Kotaku]] UK|date=4 October 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[history of video games]], LGBT content has been subject to changing rules and regulations, which are generally examples of [[heterosexism]], in that heterosexuality is normalized, while homosexuality is subject to additional [[censorship]] or ridicule. Companies [[Nintendo]], [[Sega]] and [[Maxis]] policed the content of games with content codes in which LGBT themes were toned down or erased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steltenpohl|first=Crystal|title=GLBT History in Video Games: 1990s|url=http://www.gamingbus.com/2012/06/12/glbt-history-video-games-1990s/|publisher=Gaming Bus|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Phantasy"&gt;{{cite web|first=Mike|last=Ripplinger|year=2002|title=The Two Phantasy Stars  |url=http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204060641/http://www.camineet.net/camineet/theories/twophantasystars.asp|archivedate=2008-02-04|publisher=Camineet|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ModtheSims"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100128041935/http://www.modthesims.info/download.php?t=388170 "Autonomous Romantic Socials - Same Sex"], by werismyki&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sims3"&gt;[http://forum.thesims3.com/jforum/posts/list/30/191458.page "Why is My Town Gay?"], by Srikandi&lt;/ref&gt; Some games, for instance, originally included trans characters, such as [[Birdo|Birdo from Super Mario Bros]], [[Poison (Final Fight)|Poison from the Final Fight series]], and Flea from Chrono Trigger.

The video game industry is regarded as having [[Heteronormativity|heteronormative]] bias by numerous analysts.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hot Dates and Fairytale Romances: Studying Sexuality in Video Games|last=Consalvo|first=Mia|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415965780|location=New York, NY|pages=172–191|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":gay in games"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|date=2009-07-01|title=Putting the Gay in Games Cultural Production and GLBT Content in Video Games|url=http://gac.sagepub.com/content/4/3/228|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|volume=4|issue=3|pages=228–253|doi=10.1177/1555412009339729|issn=1555-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to industry professionals interviewed by Shaw, reasons for this [[heteronormativity]] include the demographic of those who play games, the views of those who create games, the risk of backlash in the industry, and the storytelling limitations of the medium.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt;

Choice based LGBT content, such as optional same sex romance in Bioware games,&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Krobová|first=Tereza|last2=Moravec|first2=Ondřej|last3=Švelch|first3=Jaroslav|title=Dressing Commander Shepard in pink: Queer playing in a heteronormative game culture|url=http://cyberpsychology.eu/view.php?cisloclanku=2015081905&amp;article=3|journal=Cyberpsychology: Journal of Psychosocial Research on Cyberspace|volume=9|issue=3|doi=10.5817/cp2015-3-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a low- risk&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; form of representation that occurs only in video games.&lt;ref name=":at the edge"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gaming at the Edge: Sexuality and Gender at the Margins of Gamer Culture|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0-8166-9315-3|location=Minneapolis, MN|pages=13–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When representation is included, it is often through these in-game choices, which place the responsibility for representation on players instead of developers.&lt;ref name=":at the edge" /&gt; Because they afford the most opportunity for player choice and in game romance, genres such as [[Role-playing video game|RPGs]] and [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMOs]] are the most LGBT representative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/01/25/a-gay-history-of-gaming|title=A Gay History of Gaming|last=MacDonald|first=Keza|date=2012-01-25|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another low risk method of LGBT representation is "Gay window gaming," which is LGBT representation that is either subtle or avoidable in games that serves to appeal to LGBT players without alienating straight or homophobic players. This can occur in sandbox games such as [[The Sims (video game)|The Sims]].&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances" /&gt;

In games with LGBT characters or the option of an LGBT avatar, some aspects of marginalization that occur in contemporary culture are depicted despite the game's overall adherence to reality.&lt;ref name=":at the edge" /&gt; These real social constraints are imposed on a virtual world due to the way games are constructed and the community that inhabits them. Games are made on contemporary culture's heteronormative basis, and this shapes narrative and characters. In the popular [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', for example, this has "created an oppressive atmosphere for individuals who do not adhere to a heteronormative lifestyle", according to a 2013 assessment of the game's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulos|first=Alexis|date=2013-03-01|title=Confronting Heteronormativity in Online Games A Critical Discourse Analysis of LGBTQ Sexuality in World of Warcraft|url=http://gac.sagepub.com/content/8/2/77|journal=Games and Culture|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=77–97|doi=10.1177/1555412013478688|issn=1555-4120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both members of the industry&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; and LGBT players&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink" /&gt; prefer LGBT representation to be normalized in game narratives rather than made to seem abnormal or special. There are no games produced specifically to appeal to an LGBT audience.&lt;ref name=":id as a gamer"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Adrienne|date=2012-02-01|title=Do you identify as a gamer? Gender, race, sexuality, and gamer identity|url=http://nms.sagepub.com/content/14/1/28|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=28–44|doi=10.1177/1461444811410394|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; LGBT players prefer this so they can avoid marginalization in the gaming community.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":id as a gamer" /&gt;

LGBT gamers use queer readings of media to compensate for their lack of representation in it.&lt;ref name=":gay in games" /&gt; As concluded in a study by Moravec, this "imaginative play" is the most common method LGBT gamers use to relate to in game avatars&lt;ref name=":shepard in pink" /&gt; that are typically created for a presumed straight male player to relate to.&lt;ref name=":fairytale romances" /&gt;

[[Sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]] have served a significant role in some video games, with the trend being toward greater visibility of LGBT identities.&lt;ref name="NeoSeeker"&gt;[http://www.neoseeker.com/news/11314-sunday-musing-homosexuality-in-video games/ "Homosexuality in Video Games"]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, by Lydia Sung&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kotaku"&gt;[http://kotaku.com/5232808/how-not-to-address-homosexuality-in-gaming "How Not To Address Homosexuality In Gaming"], by Mike Fahey&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.joystiq.com/2007/02/26/gay-gamer-survey-results-with-large-hetero-inclusion/|title=Gay gamer survey results with large hetero inclusion|author=Alexander Sliwinski|publisher=[[Joystiq]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the Ubisoft blog, Lucien Soulband, who is openly gay and was the writer for ''[[Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon]]'', said that openly gay or lesbian characters would not appear in video games for a long while as anything other than a one-off or something that was created through user choice as seen in the ''[[Mass Effect]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age]]'' games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/2/28/5456234/video-games-wont-feature-gay-protagonists-for-a-while-says-far-cry-3|title=Video games won't feature gay protagonists 'for a while,' says Far Cry 3 writer Lucien Soulban|author=Gera, Emily|publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=2014-02-28|accessdate=2014-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character of Dorian in [[Dragon Age: Inquisition]] was regarded as a significant development for the portrayal of gay characters in games, in that his homosexuality informs plot elements that occur regardless of whether the player decides to interact with him romantically.&lt;ref name="outDorian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/popnography/2015/7/13/dorian-dragon-age-inquisition-why-gamings-breakout-gay-character-matters|last=Baume|first=Matt|work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|title=Dorian of Dragon Age: Inquisition: Why Gaming's 'Breakout' Gay Character Matters|date=July 13, 2015|accessdate=October 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With more video games featuring themes related to LGBT characters and themes, the [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) will include a video game awards category, the "Outstanding Video Game Award" for games with "outstanding LGBTQ-inclusive content", starting in its 30th [[GLAAD Media Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.polygon.com/2018/9/27/17909964/glaad-media-awards-video-game-category | title = GLAAD awards will spotlight video games for the first time | first=  Owen | last =Good | date = September 27, 2018 | accessdate = September 28, 2018 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect of gender representation in games==

=== Effect on attitudes towards gender ===
A 2008 study found that males reported playing more violent video games than females. This exposure was negatively correlated with men's certainty in their judgements when presented with a scenario of possible sexual harassment selected for its ambiguity. The exposure to violent video games was also correlated with attitudes supportive of rape.&lt;ref&gt;Dill, Karen E., Brian P. Brown, and Michael A. Collins. "[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103108001005 Effects of exposure to sex-stereotyped video game characters on tolerance of sexual harassment]." Journal of Experimental Social Psychology 44.5 (2008): 1402-1408.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on children===
Canadian non-profit [[MediaSmarts]] writes that "video games have the potential to influence how children perceive themselves and others", and despite their impact on the youth, "there is not a lot of research available in this area, and few of the existing studies stand up to critical examination. This lack of scrutiny means that we know very little about the effects that video games may have on children's development and socialization."&lt;ref name=MediaSmarts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediasmarts.ca/video-games/concerns-about-video-games |title=The Concerns About Video Games |accessdate=2014-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dietz, video game characters have the potential to shape players' perceptions of gender roles. Through social comparison processes, players learn societal expectations of appearances, behaviors and roles.&lt;ref name=Dietz&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dietz|first=Tracy|title=An Examination of Violence and Gender Role Portrayals in Video Games: Implications for Gender Socialization and Aggressive Behavior|journal=Sex Roles|year=1998|volume=38|pages=425–442|doi=10.1023/A:1018709905920|issue=5/6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Girls may expect that they be dependent victims and that their responsibilities include maintaining beauty and sexual appeal, while boys may determine that their role is to protect and defend women.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt; Thus, Dietz claims, the roles internalized by the child, including gender, become for the child, and later for the adult, a basis for other roles and for action. The gender roles internalized by young individuals have a significant impact upon their perspectives and the additional roles they assume in later life. Feminine and masculine symbols are supposed to become a part of a child's identity.&lt;ref name="Dietz" /&gt;

==Players' preferences==
Although games that included the option of selecting a female hero obtained better review scores, they sold fewer copies than games with exclusively male protagonists. [[Penny Arcade Report]] attributed the difference to larger marketing budgets for games with male heroes.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|title=Games with exclusively female heroes don't sell (because publishers don't support them)|url=http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130321064024/http://www.penny-arcade.com/report/article/games-with-female-heroes-dont-sell-because-publishers-dont-support-them||archivedate=21 March 2013|accessdate=21 November 2012|newspaper=Penny Arcade Report|date=21 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Games with a female-only protagonist had, on average, only 50% of the marketing budget of female-optional games, and 40% of the marketing budget of games with male-only protagonists.&lt;ref name="PAR 21 November 2012" /&gt; Male-only games included popular sports and war franchises such as ''Madden'' and ''Call of Duty'', and EEDAR's Jesse Divnich stated in 2010, "The factors that drive sales are based more on brand licensing, marketing budgets, development budget and a thousand other factors that have little to do with the gender of playable avatars."&lt;ref name="escapistEEDAR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/103045-EEDAR-Says-the-Chicks-Are-Alright|last=Chalk|first=Andy|work=The Escapist|title=EEDAR Says the Chicks Are Alright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polling in 2015 by Pew Research Center showed 16% of adults who play video games believe most games portray women poorly, compared to 26% who disagree, and 34% who say it depends on the game. Among those who do not play, 55% are unsure if games portray women poorly. Minimal differences were seen between male and female responses.&lt;ref name="pewGamer2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/12/15/attitudes-about-video-games/|last=Duggan|first=Maeve|publisher=Pew Research Center|title=Gaming and Gamers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2015 survey of 1,583 U.S. students aged 11 to 18 by [[Rosalind Wiseman]] and [[Ashly Burch]] indicated that 60% of girls but only 39% of boys preferred to play a character of their own gender, and 28% of girls as opposed to 20% of boys said that they were more likely to play a game based on the character's gender. The authors interpreted this as meaning that the gaming industry's focus on male protagonists stifled sales to girls more than it promoted sales to boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hall|first1=Charlie|title=The games industry is wrong about kids, gaming and gender|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/3/5/8153213/the-games-industry-is-wrong-about-kids-gaming-and-gender|accessdate=8 March 2015|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2017 survey of 1,266 gamers by Quantic Foundry, 89% of female gamers considered the inclusion of female protagonist option in games somewhat, very or extremely important; 64% of male gamers expressed the same views. Self-identified "hardcore" gamers of both genders, on average, considered a female protagonist less important than "core" or "casual" gamers did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yee|first1=Nick|title=Just How Important Are Female Protagonists?|url=http://quanticfoundry.com/2017/08/29/just-important-female-protagonists/|website=Quantic Foundry|accessdate=30 August 2017|date=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study showed that [[box art]] depicting sexualized female characters in non-central roles positively affected sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Near|first=Christopher E.|date=2013-02-01|title=Selling Gender: Associations of Box Art Representation of Female Characters With Sales for Teen- and Mature-rated Video Games|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-012-0231-6|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=68|issue=3-4|pages=252–269|doi=10.1007/s11199-012-0231-6|issn=0360-0025|pmc=3586322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{lang|de|Gerechtigkeitsspirale}}''' (German: "spiral of justice") is a [[relief carving]] of a poem at the pilgrimage church of [[St. Valentin, Kiedrich|St. Valentin]] in [[Kiedrich]], in [[Hesse]], Germany. The text is carved in the form of a [[spiral]] on the front of one of the [[pew]]s for the congregation, creating possibly the earliest known [[shape poem]] in the German language.&lt;ref name="Higgins" /&gt; The carving is one of several decorative designs on the pews in the church, and was created in 1510 by the master carpenter Erhart Falckener.

== History ==
The pews, including the spiral of justice, were commissioned by the former minister of Kiedrich, Zweifuss, who also went by the Latin name {{lang|la|Bipes}}.&lt;ref name="Staab" /&gt; The artist was Erhart Falckener, a master carpenter, who made the relief carving in late [[Gothic art|Gothic style]] in 1510.&lt;ref name="Kremer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kiedrich" /&gt; He created a spiral of text surrounded by flower ornaments of [[Acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] (left) and [[thistle]] (right). The tendrils are stylized and include a caricature in the form of a human face in profile, just above and to the right of the last letter of the word "{{lang|De|verlorn}}" (lost). The church and its late [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] interior have remained intact over the centuries, a very rare case.&lt;ref name="Staab" /&gt;

== Text ==
The text is carved in German in [[capital letters]], creating in a spiral read from the centre outwards. The height of the letters is {{convert|4|cm}} at the centre, growing to {{convert|6|cm}} at the edges.  The original German text, and two possible translations into modern English, read:

{{columns|width=auto

== Analysis ==
[[File:Kiedrich Pfarrkirche Seitenschiff nördlich.jpg|thumb|upright|The northern aisle of the church.]]
The church contains other decorative carvings.  Unlike other more traditional ribbons and text inscriptions by Falckener, this text can be read as a call for social justice and religious integrity during the time of the Reformation, a few years before the [[Palatine Peasants' War]] of 1525.&lt;ref name="Staab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Agenda" /&gt; The content of the text recalls the struggle of the virtues and vices described by the early Christian poet [[Prudentius]] in his work ''[[Psychomachia]]''. This theme was widespread in the 15th and 16th century in a simple German language formulation of the ''{{lang|la|[[Reformatio Sigismundi]]}}'', especially in a printed version from 1476.

The topic of the spiral, an outcry for justice ("{{lang|de|Schrei nach Gerechtigkeit}}") is the theme of a 2015–2016 exposition planned in [[Mainz]] about life at the mid-Rhine at the wake of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] ("{{lang|de|Leben am Mittelrhein am Vorabend der Reformation}}").&lt;ref name="Mainz" /&gt;

The first lines of the text are used as the [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] of the 2013 [[crime fiction]] book ''{{lang|de|Tod im Klostergarten}}'' (''Death in the Abbey Garden'') by Roland Stark.&lt;ref name="Stark" /&gt;

'''''Girl with Peaches''''' ({{lang-ru|Девочка с персиками}}, ''Devochka s Persikami'') is an 1887 painting by the Russian painter [[Valentin Serov]].&lt;ref name="Bowlt1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=John E.

== History ==
The painting depicts 12-year-old Vera Mamontova, a daughter of Russian entrepreneur and patron of the arts [[Savva Mamontov]].&lt;ref name="Bowlt1976" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.tretyakovgallerymagazine.com/articles/3-2015-48/girl-peaches-who-she|title=The "Girl with Peaches": who is she?|publisher=[[Tretyakov Gallery|The Tretyakov Gallery Magazine]]|year=2015|issue=#3 2015 (48)|accessdate=2016-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was painted at [[Abramtsevo Colony|Abramtsevo]], an estate not far from Moscow.&lt;ref name="vokrugsveta" /&gt; Under the ownership of the writer [[Sergei Aksakov]], Abramtsevo had become one of the centers of Russian culture. Mamontov bought the place in 1870 and continued the tradition. Among people who stayed there were painter [[Ilya Repin]], writer [[Ivan Turgenev]], painter [[Mikhail Vrubel]], and sculptor [[Mark Antokolsky]]. It was a comfortable place for artists not only to gather and discuss important topics, but to live and create.&lt;ref name="vokrugsveta" /&gt;

Valentin Serov knew Vera Mamontova from her babyhood, as he frequently visited Mamontov's Abramtsevo estate, and sometimes he even lived there for lengthy periods of time.&lt;ref name="vokrugsveta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/article/208430/|title=12 интересных фактов о "Девочке с персиками"|work=[[Vokrug sveta|Vokrug Sveta]]|date=December 16, 2016|accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serov later recalled,
{{quote|All I wanted was freshness, that special freshness that you can always feel in real life and don't see in paintings. I painted it for over a month and tortured her, poor child, to death, because I wanted to preserve the freshness in the finished painting, as you can see in old works by great masters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.art-catalog.ru/article.php?id_article=345 Art-каталог: живопись и графика]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Серов Валентин Александрович|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O2YTBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17&amp;dq=%22измучил+её%22+Cеров+%22Девочка+с+персиками%22|date=14 July 2014|publisher=ДиректМедиа|isbn=978-5-87107-184-7|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1887 the painting won first prize at the Exhibition of the Moscow Society of Lovers of Art.&lt;ref name="Semler1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AndersonDebreczeny1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger B.

The model, Vera Mamontova, married the head of the Moscow Nobility League, future Chief Prosecutor of the [[Most Holy Synod]] {{illm|Alexander Dmitrievich Samarin|ru|Самарин, Александр Дмитриевич}} in 1903.&lt;ref name="tvzvezda"/&gt; They had three children. In 1907, at the age of 32, she contracted [[pneumonia]] and died just a few days later. She is buried in Abramtsevo.&lt;ref name="vokrugsveta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tvzvezda"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvzvezda.ru/news/vstrane_i_mire/content/201601250031-re2b.htm|title=Пять тайн "Девочки с персиками": что стало с героиней знаменитой картины Серова – Телеканал "Звезда"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kulturologia.ru/blogs/191015/26759/|title=Как сложилась судьба "девочки с персиками": 7 удивительных фактов о самой известной картине Серова}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internet meme ==
The painting spawned a Russian [[Internet meme]],&lt;ref name="aif201601020"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aif.ru/culture/art/devochka_s_persikami_i_krik_istoriya_kartin_stavshih_internet-memami|title="Девочка с персиками" и "Крик".

'''Ignaz Matausch''' (September 1, 1859 – December 14, 1915) was an Austrian-American artist and [[entomology|entomologist]] known for his models of insects and other invertebrates at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. Born in [[Budweis]], he emigrated to the United States in 1892 and resided in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], until 1904, when he became a member of the modeling staff of the American Museum. He was known for his realistic large-scale models including the flea, house fly, and spider. As an entomologist he focused on [[treehopper]]s (Membracidae), authoring eight papers on their biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Ignaz Matausch|first=Roy W.|last=Miner|journal=Journal of the New York Entomological Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WHMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA155|year=1916|pages=155–157|volume=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Huge Model of the Flea|journal=Scientific American|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=isoxAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA260-IA3|year=1914|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Current Notes|journal=Journal of Economic Entomology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQn0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA515|year=1916|volume=9|page=515}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roses - Vincent van Gogh.JPG|thumb|right|100000x260px|''[[Still Life: Vase with Pink Roses]]'' is an oil painting on canvas completed by [[Vincent van Gogh]] in 1890, which makes extensive use of the ''impasto'' technique.]]

'''Impasto''' is a technique used in [[painting]], where [[paint]] is laid on an area of the surface in very thick layers,&lt;ref&gt;''Impasto.'' In: {{cite book |date=2015 |editor1-last= Weyer |editor1-first=Angela |editor2-last=Roig Picazo |editor2-first=Pilar |editor3-last=Pop |editor3-first=Daniel |editor4-last=Cassar |editor4-first=JoAnn |editor5-last=Özköse |editor5-first= Aysun |editor6-last=Vallet |editor6-first=Jean-Marc |editor7-last=Srša |editor7-first= Ivan |title=EwaGlos.

Paint can also be mixed right on the canvas. When dry, impasto provides texture; the paint appears to be coming ''out'' of the canvas.

== Origins ==
The word ''impasto'' is Italian in origin; in which it means "dough" or "mixture"; the verb "impastare" translates to "to knead", or "to paste". Italian usage of "impasto" includes both a painting and a [[impasto (pottery)|potting technique]]. According to Webster's ''New World College Dictionary'', the root noun of ''impasto'' is ''pasta'', whose primary meaning in Italian is ''paste''.

== Mediums ==
[[Oil paint]] is the traditional medium for impasto painting, due to its thick consistency and slow drying time. [[Acrylic paint]] can also be used for impasto by adding heavy body acrylic gels. Impasto is generally not seen done in [[watercolour|watercolor]] or [[tempera]] without the addition of thickening agent due to the inherent thinness of these media. An artist working in [[pastels]] can produce a limited impasto effect by pressing a soft pastel firmly against the paper.

== Purposes ==
The impasto technique serves several purposes. First, it makes the light [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] in a particular way, giving the artist additional control over the play of light in the painting. Second, it can add expressiveness to the painting, with the viewer being able to notice the strength and speed by which the artist applied the paint. Third, impasto can push a piece from a painting to a three-dimensional sculptural rendering.  The first objective was originally sought by masters such as [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Titian]], and [[Vermeer]], to represent folds in clothes or jewels: it was then juxtaposed with a more delicate painting style. Much later, the French [[Impressionists]] created pieces covering entire canvases with rich impasto textures. [[Vincent van Gogh]] used it frequently for aesthetics and expression. [[Abstract expressionists]] such as [[Hans Hofmann]] and [[Willem de Kooning]] also made extensive use of it, motivated in part by a desire to create paintings which dramatically record the action of painting itself. Still more recently, [[Frank Auerbach]] has used such heavy impasto that some of his paintings become nearly three-dimensional.

Impasto gives texture to the painting, meaning it can be opposed to more [[Flatness (art)|flat]], smooth, or blended painting styles.

== Artists ==
Many artists have used the impasto technique. Some of the more notable ones including: [[Rembrandt|Rembrandt van Rijn]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Jackson Pollock]], and [[Willem de Kooning]].&lt;center&gt;

Founded in [[Belgium]] in 1952, its members operate in more than 80 countries on 5 continents, making AITA/IATA the powerful voice of the global amateur theatre community. The current President is Mr Rob Van Genechten from Belgium (Flanders) and the organisation’s Secretariat is in [[London, England]].

==Goals==
Under its banner of universal understanding and education through theatre, AITA/IATA promotes cross-frontier cooperation, artistic enrichment, and a sense of universal togetherness.

'''International Theatre Festival'''
Alongside the GA, an  International Theatre Festival is held where amateur theatre groups selected by that country's AITA/IATA National Centre come together to perform, to attend workshops and discussions and to exchange theatre experiences. In 2015, it was held in the village of Westouter, some 10&amp;nbsp;km from Ypres, and was part of the Spots op West 2015&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spotsopwest.org/en/festival-2015&lt;/ref&gt; Festival.

Children and Youth have a voice in AITA/IATA through a standing committee, established in 1995 following AITA/IATA’s first World Festival of Children’s Theatre in [[Lingen, Germany]] in 1990. The Standing Committee (SCCY), exists to ensure that issues relating to children and youth are central to the concerns of AITA/IATA. A World Festival of Children’s Theatre is held in Lingen every four years and elsewhere in the world between every Lingen Festival and the Standing Committee offers an advisory and supportive role for the preparation of each festival. AITA/IATA works in close cooperation with other world theatre organisations such as [[ASSITEJ]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.assitej-international.org/&lt;/ref&gt; (International Association of Theatre for Children and Young People), ITI&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iti-worldwide.org/&lt;/ref&gt; ([[International Theatre Institute]]), IDEA&lt;ref&gt;http://www.idea-org.net/en/&lt;/ref&gt; ([[International Drama in Education Association]]), and other organisations such as [[EDERED]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edered.org/&lt;/ref&gt; European Drama Encounters. The Association is governed by an all-volunteer group of individuals who meet several times a year in different locations, to co-ordinate AITA/IATA's activities.

'''The members of the SCCY 2013-2015:'''
* Coordinator: Josef Hollos (Austria)
* Carlos (Tim) Cremata Malberti (Cuba)
* Bernd Ruping (Germany)
* Ron Dodson (Canada)
* Skuflic Ines Horvat (Croatia)
* Frank Katoola (Uganda)
* L. Lucky Ali (Bangladesh)
* Katharina Pongracz (Austria)
* Giuliana Lanzavecchia (Italy)

'''Secretariat'''
The Secretariat is based in London England secretariat@aitaiata.org 

'''Members'''
A member (an AITA/IATA National Centre) is an organisation that co-ordinates or networks amateur theatre groups and or individuals in their country and it is they with whom AITA/IATA predominantly communicates. An Affiliate is an organisation that over a two or four year period is working towards National Centre status. Each country has only one National Centre or Affiliate. 

'''Associates'''
An Associate is an organisation, group, individual, or festival, interested in amateur theatre. An Associate pays a subscription to AITA/IATA (less than Membership) which enables them to be linked into the AITA/IATA network of international amateur theatre.

'''World Festival of Children's Theatre'''
The first AITA/IATA World Festival of Children's Theatre was held in Lingen (Ems), Germany in 1991. It usually occurs every two years and every other Festival is held in Lingen. Non-Lingen Festivals have been held in [[Toyama, Japan]], 2000; [[Havana, Cuba]] 2004; [[Moscow, Russia]] 2008. The last Lingen Festival was in 2014 and the next World Festival of Children's Theatre will be in 2016 in [[Stratford, Ontario]], Canada. The City of Lingen will again organize the event in 2018. &lt;ref&gt;http://worldfestivalofchildrenstheatre.com/#&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Congress "Drama in Education"'''
The AITA/IATA Drama in Education Congress was held for the first time in Austria in 1974 and has been held every two years since. Until the early 90s was probably the only regular international conference on "drama in education." The last one was held in April 2015.

'''50th Anniversary'''
In 2002, AITA/IATA published a 50th Anniversary booklet in English, French and Spanish which is a reflection on the growth and development of AITA/IATA up to that date. A copy is on the AITA/IATA website under Resources / Key Documents.

'''Irving Penn''' (June 16, 1917{{spaced ndash}}October 7, 2009)&lt;ref name="Grundberg"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/arts/design/08penn.html?_r=1&amp;hp|title=Irving Penn, Fashion Photographer, Is Dead at 92|last=Grundberg|first=Andy|date=2009-10-07|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American photographer known for his [[fashion photography]], [[portraits]], and [[still life]]s.  Penn's career included work at [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]], and independent advertising work for clients including [[Issey Miyake]] and [[Clinique]].  His work has been exhibited internationally and continues to inform the art of photography.

==Biography==
Penn was born to a [[Russian Jewish]] family&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjournal.com/hollywoodjew/item/bonnie_and_clyde_director_arthur_penn_dies_at_88_20100929/ Jewish Journal: "‘Bonnie and Clyde’ director Arthur Penn dies at 88" by Danielle Berrin] September 29, 2010 (Age 0)&lt;/ref&gt; on June 16, 1917 in [[Plainfield, New Jersey]], to Harry Penn and Sonia Greenberg. Penn's younger brother, [[Arthur Penn]], was born in 1922 and would go on to become a film director and producer. Penn attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Industrial Art (now the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]]) from 1934 to 1938, where he studied drawing, painting, graphics, and industrial arts under [[Alexey Brodovitch]]. While still a student, Penn worked under Brodovitch at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' which published several of Penn's drawings.

Penn worked for two years as a freelance designer and making his first amateur photographs before taking Brodovitch's position as the art director at [[Saks Fifth Avenue]] in 1940. Penn remained at Saks Fifth Avenue for a year before leaving to spend a year painting and taking photographs in Mexico and across the US. When Penn returned to New York, [[Alexander Liberman]] offered him a position as an associate in the [[Vogue (magazine)|''Vogue'' magazine]] Art Department. Penn worked on layout for the magazine before Liberman asked him to try photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Penn|first=Irving|title=Passage|year=1991|publisher=Alfred A. Knopf|location=New York|isbn=0-679-40491-0|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn's first photographic cover for ''Vogue'' magazine appeared in October 1943. The art department of the Office of War Information in London offered him a job as an "artist-photographer" but he volunteered with the [[American Field Service]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://d22dvihj4pfop3.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/27/2017/05/01152009/AFS-Janus-2010-January.pdf|title=AFS Janus - January 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After arriving in Naples with a boatload of American troops in November 1944. Penn drove an ambulance in support of the [[British Eighth Army]] as it alternately waited out weather and slogged its way north through a miserable winter in the Italian [[Apennines]]. In July 1945, he was transferred from Italy to India. He photographed the soldiers, medical operations, and camp life for the AFS, and various subjects while bivouacked in India. He sailed back to New York in November 1945.

Penn continued to work at ''Vogue'' throughout his career, photographing covers, portraits, still lifes, fashion, and photographic essays. In the 1950s, Penn founded his own studio in New York and began making advertising photographs.  Over the years, Penn's list of clients grew to include [[General Foods]], [[De Beers]], [[Issey Miyake]], and [[Clinique]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenough|first=Sarah|title=Irving Penn Platinum Prints|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10906-7|pages=167–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn met Swedish fashion model [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] at a photo shoot in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Obituary: Irving Penn|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/6272245/Irving-Penn.html|date=2009-10-08|work=The Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mightypenn&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mighty Penn|url=http://www.vogue.com/voguedaily/2009/10/the-mighty-penn/|date=July 2007|work=Vogue|author=Fraser, Kennedy|df=}}{{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the two married at [[Chelsea Register Office]], and two years later Lisa gave birth to their son, Tom Penn, who would go on to become a metal designer.&lt;ref name=mightypenn /&gt; Lisa Fonssagrives died in 1992. Penn died aged 92 on October 7, 2009&lt;ref&gt;https://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/irving-penn-92-is-dead/?_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; at his home in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/08/arts/design/08penn.html ''New York Times'' obituary by Andy Grundberg, October 8, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Adam"/&gt;

==Photography==
Best known for his fashion photography,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gan|first=Vicky|title=Iconic Photography by the Legendary Irving Penn Comes to the American Art Museum|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/iconic-photography-by-the-legendary-irving-penn-comes-to-the-american-art-museum-25926352/|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penn's repertoire also includes portraits of creative greats; ethnographic photographs from around the world; [[Modernist]] still lifes of food, bones, bottles, metal, and found objects; and photographic travel essays.&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Adam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Quintana"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gurría-Quintana|first=Angel|title=Irving Penn retrospective|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/1a5c191a-1ce5-11df-aef7-00144feab49a.html#axzz2qhTe2IjK|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|date=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn was among the first photographers to pose subjects against a simple grey or white backdrop and he effectively used it's simplicity.&lt;ref name="Bernstein, Adam"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bernstein|first=Adam|title=Irving Penn, 92: Fashion, Celebrity Photographer Found Beauty in the Commonplace|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/07/AR2009100703848.html|accessdate=17 January 2014|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=8 October 2009|author2=Rees-Shapiro, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Quintana"/&gt;  Expanding his austere studio surroundings, Penn constructed a set of upright angled backdrops, to form a stark, acute corner. Subjects photographed with this technique included [[Martha Graham]], [[Marcel Duchamp]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], [[W. H. Auden]], and [[Igor Stravinsky]].

Penn's still life compositions are sparse and highly organized,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.jffrank.com/home/latest/london-photography-exhibitions-7-january-2016/|title=London Photography Exhibitions January 2016|date=2016-01-07|newspaper=jfFrank online|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; assemblages of food or objects that articulate the abstract interplay of line and volume. Penn's photographs are composed with a great attention to detail, which continues into his craft of developing and making prints of his photographs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=London Photography Exhibitions November 2017|url=https://www.jffrank.com/home/latest/london-photography-exhibitions-november-2017/|website=jfFrank online|publisher=jfFrank|accessdate=9 November 2017|date=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Penn experimented with many printing techniques, including prints made on aluminum sheets coated with a platinum emulsion rendering the image with a warmth that untoned silver prints lacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenough|first=Sarah|title=Irving Penn Platinum Prints|year=2005|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=0-300-10906-7|pages=5–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; His black and white prints are notable for their deep contrast, giving them a clean, crisp look.

While steeped in the Modernist tradition, Penn also ventured beyond creative boundaries. The exhibition ''Earthly Bodies'' consisted of series of posed nudes whose physical shapes range from thin to plump; while the photographs were taken in 1949 and 1950, they were not exhibited until 1980.

The [[Smithsonian American Art Museum|Smithsonian American Art Museum (SAAM)]] possesses a large collection of Penn's works, including a silver gelatin print of Penn's ''The Tarot Reader'', a photograph from 1949 of [[Jean Patchett]] and [[surrealism|surrealist]] [[Painting|painter]] [[Bridget Bate Tichenor|Bridget Tichenor]].&lt;ref name="Irving Penn"&gt;[http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artwork/?id=19489 The Tarot Reader (Jean Patchett and Bridget Tichenor) - New York 1949 by Irving Penn SAAM]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the museum received 100 images as a gift from the Irving Penn Foundation, significantly increasing the number of Penn's works in the collection to 161 images.&lt;ref&gt;Ashley Southall (August 9, 2013), [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/irving-penn-photographs-to-bolster-smithsonian-collection/ Irving Penn Photographs to Bolster Smithsonian Collection] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Irving Penn Foundation's gift forms the basis of the exhibition, ''Irving Penn: Beyond Beauty'', which is on view at SAAM before traveling to other museum venues around the United States.&lt;ref name=beyondbeauty /&gt;

==Quotations==
:"Photographing a cake can be art." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.photo-seminars.com/Fame/irving_penn.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209043128/http://www.photo-seminars.com/Fame/irving_penn.htm |archivedate=2008-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:"A good photograph is one that communicates a fact, touches the heart, and leaves the viewer a changed person for having seen it; it is in one word, effective." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn.

:"Sensitive people faced with the prospect of a camera portrait put on a face they think is one they would like to show the world. ...Very often what lies behind the facade is rare and more wonderful than the subject knows or dares to believe." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn, 1975.

:"I found pictures trying to show peoples in their natural circumstances generally disappointing [but] feel secure in the artificial circumstances of the studio [accepting] for myself a stylization that I felt was more valid than a simulated naturalism." &amp;mdash;Irving Penn, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Prins, Harald E.L., “Ethnographic Portraits, 1967-71.” Pp. 212-219, 366-367.

'''Jewish Impact Films''' is a fellowship of young [[Jewish]] filmmakers, established in 2004 by leading [[Hollywood]] producers to empower young [[Jew]]s to use creative media, specifically short [[internet]]-based films, to effectively communicate new messaging about [[Judaism]] and [[Israel]].

Senior members of the program include [[David Sacks]], Jason Venokur, Rabbi Yaacov Deyo, [[Brian Ash]], [[David N. Weiss]], Michael Borkow and [[Daniel Kaufman (director)]].

A typical JIF program teams 15 young Jews with a volunteer staff of industry professionals to create 30 short films over the course of a few weeks. The first two fellowships took place in [[Los Angeles]] during the summers of 2004 and 2005. The two more recent programs took place in [[Jerusalem]] in winter 2006 and summer 2006.

In addition to showcasing short films, the site was a gateway to more information about the subjects discussed in the films.

This is a list of notable '''[[Chic (style)|chics]]'''.
{{wiktionary|chic}}
{{TOC right}}

==Chics==


===Ashcan chic===
Term used in the United States c. 2005 for a "homeless" style, similar to '''[[boho-chic]]''', that was initially popularised in [[Greenwich Village]]. Its main features were floppy hats, sunglasses and "dust-catcher" skirts. '''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bobo]]''' (''i.e.'' ''[[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]]''-Bohemian) '''chic''' was used in a similar sense.

===Beach chic===
"Beach chic" was the title of an article in 2006 by the ''Times'' fashion editor [[Lisa Armstrong]] about shopping for accessories to accompany a [[bikini]].&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 22 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; These included a "cover-up" (''e.g.'' a [[kaftan]]), flat sandals, a hat, a [[sunless tanning|fake tan]] and - with the comforting footnote, "No, you will not look like a [[WAGs|WAG]] [wife or girlfriend of a footballer]" - denture cleaner to whiten finger-nails. The ''Sunday Times'' referred to the Moroccan resort of [[Essaouira]] as the "[[boho-chic#Morocco|boho]]/'''barefoot-chic''' beach" (the latter possibly a play on the term, "bare-faced cheek").&lt;ref name="Style, 18 June 2006"&gt;''Style'', 18 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
''See also [[List of chics#Seaside chic|Seaside chic]]''.

===Boho-chic===
{{main|Boho-chic}}
Trend of fashion in the early 2000s (decade) which drew on earlier [[Bohemian style|Bohemian]] and [[hippie]] styles. It was associated in particular with actress [[Sienna Miller]] and model [[Kate Moss]]. [[Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen]] have both become icons for this style.

===Bon chic bon genre===
:''See [[Parisian chic]]''

===Camilla chic===
Emulating the style, of which [[Burberry]] was a feature, of [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall]], who married Charles, Prince of Wales in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Susie Dent (2005) ''Fanboys and Overdogs''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casual chic===
"Casual chic" (or "chic casual") is a difficult term to define, but can perhaps best be described as "dressing down" in a stylish way. In 2007, the clothing retailer [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] suggested that some of the elements of "chic casual" were [[slim-fit pants|skinny jeans]], "longline, clingy jerseys", "statement" bags and chunky jewellery, slouchy sweaters and hoodies with comfortable flats. Singer [[Victoria Beckham]] was identified as epitomising this style.&lt;ref name="Your M&amp;S, Spring 2007"&gt;''Your M&amp;S'', Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt; '''Easy chic''' ("breezy blouses, slouchy knits and sexy [[denim]]"&lt;ref name="Your M&amp;S, Spring 2007"/&gt;) has similar connotations.

===Chav chic===
:''See [[List of chics#Council house chic|council house chic]]''

===Checkout chic===
Referring to fashion ranges promoted by major [[supermarket]]s: "[[Tesco]] has stepped up its '[[Point of sale|checkout]] chic' war with [[Asda]] by launching a design-led range of clothes to tempt female shoppers".&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 29 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; '''Cheap chic''' was used in a similar sense, though more in terms of the comparison between prices at supermarkets and those of leading fashion houses: "You can achieve this season's look just by visiting your local supermarket".&lt;ref&gt;''Metro'', 31 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chelsea chic===
Used by the ''Sunday Times'' ("The Sloane gets a sexy revamp"&lt;ref name="Style, 18 June 2006"/&gt;) for fashionable trends among well-heeled "[[Sloane Ranger]]s" (a ''[[portmanteau]]'' term coined in 1975 by [[Peter York]], style editor of ''[[Harper's Bazaar|Harpers &amp; Queen]]'', from [[Sloane Square]] and the 1950s TV series ''[[The Lone Ranger]]''&lt;ref&gt;See ''Oxford Dictionary of New Words'', 1991&lt;/ref&gt;) in the [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] area of south west London.

===Council house chic===
"Council house chic"&lt;ref&gt;Susie Dent (2004) ''Larpers and Shroomers''&lt;/ref&gt; or '''chav chic''' ("Chav Chic might have sunk the house of Burberry"&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Magazine'', 26 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;) referred to the fashions of working class "[[chav]]s" who shared [[Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall|Camilla]], Duchess of Cornwall's taste for Burberry check. ''See also [[List of chics#Camilla chic|Camilla chic]]''.

===Cycle chic===
{{main|Cycle chic}}
To be well dressed and smart in everyday clothes whilst cycling for ordinary journeys.&lt;ref&gt;Cycle Chic Manifesto, http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/2008/04/cycle-chic-manifesto.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eco Chic===
Eco Chic means the use of eco-friendly textiles, such as [[organic cotton]], [[silk]] and [[hemp]], and also [[reconstructed clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://planetark.org/wen/51195 |title=World Environment News - A model displays an outfit during the EcoChic Shanghai fashion show |publisher=Planet Ark |date=2009-01-12 |accessdate=2012-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geek chic===
{{main|Geek chic}}
"The look of a computer nerd".&lt;ref&gt;Dent (2003) ''The Language Report''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goth chic===
Title of a "connoisseur's guide" by Gavin Baddeley (2002) to dark or Gothic culture. Among those associated with the "[[Gothic fashion|goth]] look" were the late 1970s [[punk rock|punk]] band [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], American punk cabaret duo [[The Dresden Dolls]], formed in 2000, and [[Megan Burns|Betty Curse]], described by ''[[The Times]]'' in 2006 as the "princess of Goth pop".&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Knowledge'', 3 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heroin chic===
{{main|Heroin chic}}
[[Heroin chic]] was a look popularized in mid-1990s fashion and characterized by pale skin, dark circles underneath the eyes and angular bone structure. The look, characterised by emaciated features and androgyny, was a reaction against the healthy and vibrant look of models such as [[Cindy Crawford]] and [[Claudia Schiffer]]. A 1996 article in ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' opened that the fashion industry had "a nihilistic vision of beauty" that was reflective of drug addiction, while ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' called the movement a "cynical trend".

===Hick chic===
[[wiktionary:hick|Hick]] chic" was the subject of an article in ''Country Life'' in 2006 by Carla Carlisle, American-born wife of former British Member of Parliament, Sir [[Kenneth Carlisle]]. Lady Carlisle cited a friend's description of the term: "it's [[farmers' market]]s, [[four-wheel drive]] cars, [[Labrador Retriever|labradors]], [[Harris Tweed]], [[Shakers|Shaker]] furniture, [[Emma Bridgewater]] [tableware] ...".&lt;ref&gt;''Country Life'', 23 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; "Hick" derives from "Old Hickory", a nickname for [[Andrew Jackson]], US President 1829-37, a [[frontier]]sman who, like [[hickory]] wood, was known for his toughness.

===High Street chic===
Applied to the sort of "everyday" sense of style that might be spotted in any metropolitan or provincial setting; most likely to be associated with prevailing "shop window" fashions. In 2004 the ''Observer'' wrote of the singer [[Dido (singer)|Dido]] that "she drifts on stage dressed in [[High Street|high-street]] chic: faded [[denim]] and a [[tracksuit]] top, which she slips off to reveal a pink [[camisole]] vest".&lt;ref&gt;''Observer", 1 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samantha Cameron]], wife of British [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] leader and future Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] was described in 2006 as "spurn[ing] the designers ... for high street chic".&lt;ref&gt;''London Lite'', 2 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Hippie chic}} Hippie chic===
:Also known as ''Art-school chic'' and ''[[Talitha Getty]] chic''
Broadly similar to [[boho-chic]] (see ''e.g.'' London ''Evening Standard Magazine'', 11 March 2005), the [[Hippie chic]] was associated in the mid-1990s with [[Tom Ford]]’s collections for the Italian house of [[Gucci]] and, indeed, various aspects of hippie fashion re-appeared periodically after the "[[Summer of Love]]" of 1967 when hippiedom and [[psychedelia]] were at their peak. '''Art-school chic'''&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 1 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; had roughly similar connotations. '''[[Talitha Getty]] chic''' was applied by Hedley Freeman in the ''Guardian''&lt;ref&gt;''Guardian'', 24 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; to the hippie style associated in the late 1960s (and since) with the actress wife (died 1971) of [[Paul Getty|John Paul Getty]]. Talitha Getty is said to have inspired Ford's hippie-style creations.

=== Marzahn chic ===

:Also known as ''[[Lichtenberg]] chic''
Refers to the clothing style seen in some eastern and northern parts of Germany. It is composed of sweatpants or tracksuits, ''[[baseball cap|Basecaps]]'' and running shoes, commonly in bright colors like neon pink or yellow.
The name originates from the locality [[Berlin-Marzahn]] where this style can frequently be seen. It also refers to the clothing style of ''Cindy aus Marzahn'', a fictional character played by German comedian [[Ilka Bessin]].

===Military chic===
:Also known as ''Soldier chic''
Adoption of [[military]] gear such as camouflage patterned clothing, war medals, military insignia, surplus clothing or [[dog tag (identifier)|dog tag necklaces]] (adopted in the [[American Civil War]]) into fashion. The term and the similar '''soldier chic''' were widely applied ''c.''2003-5, although in fact military apparel, such as the flight jackets worn by pilots during the Second World War, had frequently influenced fashion and paradoxically was often in vogue at times of anti-war feeling, such as in the late 1960s when protests against the [[Vietnam War]] were at their height (as, indeed, after the [[Iraq War]] of 2003): "One would have thought, given the unpopularity of armed forces activity in some quarters, that 'military chic' would not be, well, chic".&lt;ref&gt;Ken Kessler, ''The Times'', 17 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nazi chic===
{{main|Nazi chic}}
[[Nazi chic]] is the incorporation of Nazi style clothing and culture, often used for shock value, as a form of rebellion against the status quo, although it is sometimes accompanied by a genuine sympathy for or adherence to the ideology of National Socialism.

===Northern chic===
Occasionally applied retrospectively&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''The 60s: the Beatles' Decade'', UKtv 2006&lt;/ref&gt; to aspects of the musical and cultural boom generated by the rock group, [[the Beatles]], and other artists such as [[Gerry &amp; The Pacemakers]] and [[Billy J. Kramer|Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas]] in 1962-4 (the "[[Beat music|Mersey Sound]]"). "Northern" is a reference both to Northern England (as also with "[[Northern soul]]") and [[Northern Songs]], which published compositions by the Beatles' [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]].

===Parisian chic===
:Also known as ''Bon chic bon genre''
Frequently applied to anything stylish connected with the French capital [[Paris]] or to the style of French celebrities (''e.g.'' actress [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]]&lt;ref&gt;London ''Evening Standard magazine'', 15 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; or others living in Paris, such as the English actress [[Kristin Scott Thomas]]&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', ''The Times Guide to Paris Style &amp; Fashion'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;). Variants included '''"[[Rive Gauche|Left Bank]]'''" or '''"[[Rive Droite|Right Bank]]'''" '''chic''' (or even "Left Bank chic versus Right Bank polish").&lt;ref&gt;''The Times Guide to Paris Style &amp; Fashion'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Gainsbourg's mother, the British-born actress [[Jane Birkin]], remarked that she would choose "English eccentricity over Parisian chic every time", adding, "chic you can learn - it's just a form of grooming".&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 22 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''''bon chic bon genre''''' or '''''[[Max Azria|BCBG]]''''' ["good style, good class"] was applied in the early 1980s to the French equivalent of British "[[Chelsea chic|Sloane Rangers]]", their typical "uniform" including a [[mackintosh]], [[ballet shoes]], trousers, a [[cashmere wool|cashmere]] sweater, and accessories such as a "[[Birkin bag]]" and a [[Pierre Cartier (jeweler)|Cartier]] Tank Française wrist-[[watch]].&lt;ref&gt;Carola Long in ''The Times Guide to Paris Style &amp; Fashion'', October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  To a large extent, it refers to upper-class, or upper-middle-class, young men and women who are well-bred, or appear so, with good bones, slim bodies, and a sophisticated, but restrained and elegant, sense of style. In the U.S., the [[Ralph Lauren]] sense of style would be the equivalent.

===Porn chic===
{{main|Porno chic}}
"Porn chic" was first applied to films such as ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) and ''[[Emmanuelle]]'' (1974) which were commercially successful and thus tended to bring "soft" [[pornography]] into the mainstream. Subsequently it has been used to refer more generally to pornography in popular culture.

===Prairie chic===
Flat caps and floral dresses or aprons over jeans.&lt;ref&gt;For example, ''Daily Telegraph'', 16 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radical chic===
{{main|Radical chic}}
:Also known as ''Terrorist chic''
First coined by journalist [[Tom Wolfe]] in 1970, '''radical chic''' has since entered broad usage as a derogatory term for the pretentious adoption of [[Political radicalism|radical]] causes by [[Celebrity|celebrities]], [[socialite]]s, and [[Upper class|high society]].

===Rich-girl chic===
Said to be "oozed" by a New York socialite in Plum Sykes' ''The Debutante Divorcée'' (2006).

===Rock-girl chic===
"Rock-girl chic" has meant different things during differing periods of music and fashion, but was often associated with a hippie image and was similar enough as a phrase to the slightly patronising "rock chick" to convey a sense of being a "[[groupie]]". This and similar terms, such as "[[boho-chic#Boho-rock|boho-rock]]" (2006), were often applied to model [[Kate Moss]], about whom Rebecca Ley from Times Online wrote that "Kate veers effortlessly between rock-girl chic and dripping-in-diamonds elegance".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/article687726.ece&lt;/ref&gt; Moss's relationship in 2005–7 with [[Pete Doherty]] of the group [[Babyshambles]] tended to emphasise the tag.

===Rural chic===
Applied by the ''Sunday Times'' to a fashion collection designed and modelled by [[Savannah Miller]], [[Cotswolds|Cotswold]]-based sister of actress and 2000s (decade) "[[boho-chic|boho]]-queen" [[Sienna Miller]], for the [[Hong Kong]] based label, [[Shanghai Tang]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Times Style'', 20 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shabby chic===
{{main|Shabby chic}}
The deliberate use of worn and shabby materials in interior design or fashion. The effect of [[Whitewash|limewashing]] timber-framed buildings has been described as "shabby chic".&lt;ref&gt;James Boutwood, letter, ''Country Life'', 19 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soldier chic===
:''See [[Military chic]]''

===Talitha Getty===
:''See [[List of chics#Hippie chic|Hippie chic]]''

===Terrorist chic===
:''See [[List of chics#Radical chic|Radical chic]]''

===Tropical Chic===
Tropical and Beach themed home accents that are influenced by island styles and tropical designs. Tropical Chic style includes modern appointments, yet casual island style living.&lt;ref&gt;''Tropical Chic Style, Home Decorating News'', 2 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waif Chic===
Characterized by crochet-knit tops, over-sized sweaters that hang loosely off a thin frame, flats, and circle-frame glasses that accentuate a doe-eyed appearance.  Waif chic first came to prominence in Cambridge, MA and is a popular look among college students and young professionals in the area.

===Wilderness chic===
{{main|Wilderness chic}}
Fashion trend inspired by clothing typical of [[hikers]], [[climbing|climbers]], and [[mountaineers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="174226">[[File:Las Vegas skyline 2014.jpg|thumb|right|Several high-rise condominiums along the Las Vegas Strip (2014)]]
Since the 1990s, various '''condominium projects have been proposed for the [[Las Vegas Valley]]'''. [[Park Towers (Las Vegas)|Park Towers]] and [[Turnberry Place]], two high-rise condominium properties located near the [[Las Vegas Strip]], were completed in 2001; they subsequently inspired a condominium boom that started in 2003, when various developers began announcing projects that were planned throughout the Las Vegas Valley.

Many projects were ultimately cancelled because of a rise in construction costs, as well as a lack of skilled construction workers and contractors who were qualified to build high-rises; both reasons were attributed to the large number of projects being announced. The following list includes notable condominium projects that were both completed and cancelled, as well as projects that are on hold.

==History==
===Early history===
[[#Regency Towers|Regency Towers]], built in 1974, was the first high-rise condominium property to open in the [[Las Vegas Valley]],&lt;ref name=bide/&gt; with 226-units. The property was initially unsuccessful, selling only eight units before going into foreclosure. In the late 1990s, Las Vegas was the fastest-growing area in the United States.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr8-1999/&gt; As a result, five new high-rise condominium projects were being planned for the Las Vegas Valley in 1998, for a total of 12 new condominium towers. Among the five proposed projects was [[#Turnberry Place|Turnberry Place]] and [[#Park Towers|Park Towers]].&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr8-1999&gt;{{cite news|last=Macy|first=Robert|title=Developers pitching pricey penthouses as Vegas enters the condo market|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/1999/apr/08/developers-pitching-pricey-penthouses-as-vegas-ent/|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=April 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Luxury towers eclipse rivals|url=http://www.lvrj.com/lvrj_home/2001/May-15-Tue-2001/business/16096051.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=May 15, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020812080253/http://www.lvrj.com/lvrj_home/2001/May-15-Tue-2001/business/16096051.html|archivedate=August 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike approximately 80 other condominium projects, Palm Beach Resort received county approval, had the project designed, and began construction before taking reservations. Stewart Simpson, the senior vice president of development for the project, said at the start of construction, "Most of these projects, they have a concept, they option for a piece of land and go out and start explaining it. Instead of saying we have this dream and hope we can make it happen, we had a dream and we didn't tell anyone about it and did our homework."&lt;ref name=Boca-Nov/&gt; The project was designed by Pierce Goodwin Alexander and Linville (PGAL).&lt;ref name=Boca-Nov/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boca-Higher/&gt;

Groundbreaking for the first phase began on November 17, 2004, with completion expected for February 2006. The $400 million project was planned to ultimately consist of four seven-story towers, with a total of 756 units. Prices were expected to start at $200,000. The project was also planned to include a two-story underground parking garage.

The {{convert|2.4|acre|abbr=on|sing=on}}&lt;ref name=Juhl-topped/&gt; property was initially occupied by four houses.

A total of five towers {{ndash}} standing 18 to 21 stories {{ndash}} were ultimately planned for the property, with a final total of 890 condominium units. A 200-room [[boutique hotel]] and a 200-unit condo-hotel {{ndash}} both of which would be operated by the same company {{ndash}} were also planned at that time.

Ambling invested $2 million to acquire the land, to open a Las Vegas office, and to perform initial design work. Months later, on December 15, 2004, the City Council voted unanimously to reject Ambling's project because of opposition from nearby residents, who believed that the tall modern-style glass buildings would not go well with the neighborhood's southwestern theme and its 600 single-story houses.&lt;ref name=Ambling1/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rejection/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kalil|first=J.M.|title=Condominium Controversy: Residents praise Weekly|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-30-Thu-2004/news/25562756.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=December 30, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041231040825/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-30-Thu-2004/news/25562756.html|archivedate=December 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Residents also believed the new project would create traffic problems and overcrowd nearby schools.

===Cielo Vista===
In March 2005, the Seattle-based Northwest Resource Management Group filed plans with the city of Las Vegas for Cielo Vista, a 25-story condominium tower with 414 units, as well as {{convert|32000|sqft|abbr=on}} of commercial space on the first floor. Above the first floor would be six floors used for parking, and 18 floors for condominium units. The project was designed by Las Vegas-based MWT Ofra, and was scheduled for a vote by the Las Vegas Planning Commission and the City Council in May and June 2005, respectively.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr1-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cielo/&gt;

Cielo Vista would have been the company's first Las Vegas project. The company had previously developed single-family residential homes in California, as well as an 11-story building in Seattle. Cielo Vista was to be built at the southeast corner of East Washington Avenue and Veterans Memorial Drive, west of [[Cashman Field]] and north of downtown Las Vegas, on a 2.8-acre site that the company purchased for $1.2 million on March 29, 2005.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr1-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cielo/&gt; A local expert believed that the project was in a bad location: an older part of Las Vegas with little development.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr1-2005/&gt; The area was also known for a high rate of crime and homelessness; Steve Hartley, a partner for Northwest Resource Management Group, said the company had previously developed a project in California that had similar demographics.&lt;ref name=Cielo/&gt;

The low price of the land allowed the company to sell condominium units ranging from {{convert|1000|sqft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|2000|sqft|abbr=on}} at a starting price of $295,000, and exceeding $500,000. Condominium units in the project could be reserved for a refundable fee of $5,000, compared to a $25,000 fee that was being charged by some other high-rise condominium projects in the city. Construction was expected to begin in late 2005, as long as the project received approval from the city. Completion was expected by early 2007.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr1-2005&gt;{{cite news|last=Shubinski|first=Jennifer|title=Developer plans condos in high-risk area near downtown|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/apr/01/developer-plans-condos-in-high-risk-area-near-down/|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=April 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cielo&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Another LV high-rise in the works|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-06-Wed-2005/business/1030424.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=April 6, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050907073924/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Apr-06-Wed-2005/business/1030424.html|archivedate=September 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project received unanimous approval from the Las Vegas Planning Commission in June 2005.

Three months after the announcement of Cielo Vista, Northwest Resource suspended sales and delayed the project because of rising construction costs, choosing instead to wait until it was further along in the construction cost process before beginning sales; 300 units had been reserved up to that point, and some buyers received a refund. As final construction costs were being determined in March 2006, Eric Radovich, Northwest Resource's managing director of public relations and marketing, said, "We're getting close to a number and we think it's real. We didn't feel we could tell people truthfully what the product was going to cost and whether we can afford to build it."&lt;ref name=bide&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=High-rise builders bide their time, wait their turn; Failures of quick-to-market projects have developers delaying sales|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Mar-12-Sun-2006/business/6108360.html|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|date=March 12, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060910003557/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Mar-12-Sun-2006/business/6108360.html|archivedate=September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project never materialized.&lt;ref name=SelloutNewport&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Sellout of Newport Lofts condo project seen as positive sign for area|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/sellout-newport-lofts-condo-project-seen-positive-sign-area|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, Diversified Real Estate Group and Downtown Redevelopment Group announced Club Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official website|url=http://www.clubrenaissancelv.com/|publisher=Club Renaissance|accessdate=March 16, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050211113921/http://www.clubrenaissancelv.com/|archivedate=February 11, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 60-story condominium tower with either 906 units&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Club/&gt; or 950 units.&lt;ref name=LVS-Club&gt;{{cite news|last=Shubinski|first=Jennifer|title=Another condominium complex planned for downtown Vegas|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/jan/07/another-condominium-complex-planned-for-downtown-v/|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mayor Oscar Goodman noted the $150,000 starting price for condominiums in the project, saying, "I like the affordability of it."&lt;ref name=Club-Feb17/&gt; Philippe Pageau-Goyette, the president of Diversified Real Estate Group, planned for Club Renaissance to be the least-expensive high-rise condominium in the Las Vegas Valley, and said 95 percent of the project's inhabitants would be local residents: "I don't want to go after luxury, I want to go after locals. As of right now, we have no competition in the locals affordable market. A lot of guys are doing luxury."&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Club/&gt;

The project would include {{convert|20000|sqft|abbr=on}} of retail space, located on the first floor.&lt;ref name=LVS-Club/&gt; Other amenities on the lower floors were to include restaurants, a food market, child day care, and dry cleaners.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Club/&gt; An additional {{convert|78000|sqft|abbr=on}} of office space would be located on the 13th and 14th floors, with condominium units beginning on floor 15. The top two floors, 58 and 59, were to include a private club and fitness center. The project was planned for the southeast corner of Casino Center Boulevard and Bonneville Street in downtown Las Vegas. Presale reservations were expected to begin in March 2005.&lt;ref name=LVS-Club/&gt; At the time of its announcement, the project was reported to cost $400 million to construct.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Club&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Developer plans condominium project for locals|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Jan-31-Mon-2005/business/25760479.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=January 31, 2005|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215155216/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Jan-31-Mon-2005/business/25760479.html|archivedate=December 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost was later reported as being $250 million.&lt;ref name=Club-Feb15/&gt;

As of February 2006, the cottages remained on the site, with little progress on Club Renaissance. Gilles Pageau, a Canadian developer and the uncle of Philippe Pageau-Goyette, said he had invested $60 million of his money into the project and that he had been offered an additional $400 million from various banks to cover the construction costs. Pageau said at the time that the project would still be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Club Renaissance will get built, developer vows|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Feb-13-Mon-2006/business/5772051.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=February 13, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060216044725/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Feb-13-Mon-2006/business/5772051.html|archivedate=February 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Goodman gave the developers two weeks to demonstrate to the Las Vegas City Council that the project was nearing construction; otherwise, he said the approval for the project would be revoked. Leanord Mussina, a spokesman for the project, had told the City Council, "We're just a victim of construction costs. Financing has dried up to a large extent for Las Vegas. We're redesigning, trying to value engineer, to do something affordable. We're in negotiations with some large construction companies to joint venture at this point, because that's the only way to finance it." Mussina estimated that the project could take up to a year before construction started, to which Goodman responded, "I'm not interested in a year. I've been to three groundbreakings there so far and haven't seen ground broke." Approximately $8 million or $9 million had already been spent on the project up to that point.&lt;ref name=LVS-Feb11-2007&gt;{{cite news|last=McGrath Schwartz|first=David|title=Council pressures downtown builders|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Feb-11-Sun-2007/news/12515962.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=February 11, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404174743/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2007/Feb-11-Sun-2007/news/12515962.html|archivedate=April 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The City Council ultimately granted the project a six-month extension.

===Fontainebleau Las Vegas===
{{Main article|The Drew Las Vegas}}

===Icon===
In November 2004, [[Jorge M.

By April 2005, the project had been redesigned after Lorenzo Doumani, developer of the adjacent [[#Majestic Las Vegas|Majestic Las Vegas]], raised concerns about the Icon blocking views for tenants at the Majestic, among other issues.

In January 2006, Related announced the cancellation of Icon despite that buyers had signed contracts for most of the project's 514 units.

===Krystle Sands===
On April 1, 2004, reservations opened for floors 4 to 38 of a 45-story, 510-foot condominium-hotel tower known as Krystle Sands. The project was officially announced in May 2004 by F.W.

At the time of the announcement, 70 percent of the project's 600 units had been reserved.&lt;ref name=LVS-May7-2004/&gt;

Units would range from {{convert|852|sqft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1329|sqft|abbr=on}}, and would range in price from $400,000 to more than $700,000. Although the tower was to be 45 stories high, it would skip the 13th floor.&lt;ref name=LVS-May7-2004/&gt; The tower's penthouses, starting at $1 million,&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Mar23-2005/&gt; would be located from floors 39 to 44, and would range from {{convert|2400|sqft|abbr=on}} to more than {{convert|3000|sqft|abbr=on}}. Restaurants and retail were planned for the tower's first and second floors. The third floor was to consist of a recreation center and pool for condominium owners and renters. A rooftop restaurant was also planned. JMA Architecture Studios was the architect. Perini Construction Company was to be the general contractor.

Shortly after the cancellation was announced, some buyers of the project's condominium units filed five lawsuits against Schinz, Krystle Sands LLC, Krystle Towers LLC, and Fidelity National Title Agency of Nevada. One lawsuit sought class-action status. Each lawsuit alleged that Schinz never planned to build the tower and was in the process of seeking a buyer for the property while selling the project's 600 units, in an alleged attempt to make what would ultimately become a $70 million profit. Other claims in the lawsuits included allegations of fraud, deceptive trade practices and civil conspiracy. Plaintiffs sought at least $70 million in damages, as well as the return of escrow money to the buyers. One lawsuit alleged that Turnberry had made false statements regarding its reason for cancelling Krystle Sands, noting that four days earlier, Turnberry had announced that it received construction financing for a separate 636-unit tower at its Turnberry Place complex.&lt;ref name=LVS-Apr4-2005/&gt;

A class action lawsuit consisting of 150 buyers was underway by June 2006, alleging that Turnberry had an obligation to provide condominium units to buyers who signed purchase and sale agreements and placed 10 percent of the purchase price in escrow. Turnberry stated that all deposits made on Krystle Sands units had been returned and that the company had no intention of building the project. A lawyer representing the group alleged that Turnberry lied to buyers about being unable to obtain construction financing for Krystle Sands as part of an attempt to build the [[#Fontainebleau Resort Las Vegas|Fontainebleau resort]] on the property: "They had to figure a way to lie to buyers and not tell the truth that they're going to jettison the project to build Fountainbleu [sic]." The case was expected to go to trial in March 2007.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Jun3-2006&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Hubble|title=Krystal Sands buyers file lawsuit over failed project|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jun-03-Sat-2006/business/7758674.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=June 3, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629140633/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jun-03-Sat-2006/business/7758674.html|archivedate=June 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scandia and The Congress Group agreed to delay the initial escrow closing date of May 2005, so that final costs for the new project could be completed. As part of the agreement, the Scandia fun center would remain open through the summer, its busiest period, before its scheduled closing date on September 6, 2005.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Mar26-2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=LVS-Mar28-2005/&gt;

At the time of the announcement, the property was in the process of being sold by Highrise Partners to The Congress Group for an undisclosed amount of money, with escrow expected to close in September 2005. Groundbreaking was expected to occur in the first quarter of 2006, with the first units available for occupancy in spring 2008. Opus Las Vegas would have featured 1,400 parking spaces spread across four levels, along with {{convert|20000|sqft|abbr=on}} of residential retail stores. A {{convert|3|acre|abbr=on}} pool would be located on the property's six-story deck. Floor plans would have ranged from {{convert|800|sqft|abbr=on}} {{convert|4200|sqft|abbr=on}}, and would have come in one-, two-, and three-bedroom designs, while the top two floors would be occupied by two-story penthouses.&lt;ref name=LVRJ-Mar26-2005&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Mar-26-Sat-2005/business/957501.html|title= Strip family center sold: Developers plan high-rise condo at Scandia site|last= Smith|first= Hubble|date= March 26, 2005|work= Las Vegas Review-Journal|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050328002455/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Mar-26-Sat-2005/business/957501.html|archive-date=March 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LVS-Mar28-2005&gt;{{cite web |url= http://lasvegassun.com/news/2005/mar/28/expert-high-rise-shakeout-is-likely/|title= Expert: High-rise shakeout is likely|last= Shubinski|first= Jennifer|date= March 28, 2005|work= Las Vegas Sun|access-date=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices would have ranged from $200,000 to more than $4 million.&lt;ref name=LVS-Mar28-2005/&gt; Developer Michael Jabara said the project would offer "a metropolitan lifestyle for people who really want it all, great views, easy access to nearby neighborhood amenities, but at the same time it's an urban project."&lt;ref name=LVS-Mar28-2005/&gt;

A casino and hotel and condo resort with more than 1,800 units that was planned by Royal Palms Las Vegas, a subsidiary of Royal Palms Communities.&lt;ref name=Klondike2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Klondike/&gt; The project was to replace the [[Klondike Hotel and Casino]] at the south end of the Las Vegas Strip,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hauteliving.com/2007/09/miamis-backyard/1078/|title= Miami's Backyard: Miami Architects Bet Big on Vegas|last= Wilson|first= Stephanie|date= September 24, 2007|work= [[Haute Living]]|access-date=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Klondike2&gt;{{cite web|title=Royal Palms|url=http://dsnet.co.clark.nv.us/dsnetapps/agendaweb/Data/P0190954.htm|publisher=Clark County|accessdate=March 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; beside the [[Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign|Las Vegas welcome sign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rpcholdings.com/planning-entitlement.aspx|title= Coming Soon|publisher= Royal Palms Communities|access-date= March 16, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140830143737/http://www.rpcholdings.com/planning-entitlement.aspx|archive-date= August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resort was approved in October 2006,&lt;ref name=Klondike2/&gt; but an investor pulled out of the project in August 2007, and the land was put up for sale in May 2008.&lt;ref name=Klondike&gt;{{cite news|last=Knightly|first=Arnold M.|title=Klondike Inn site owner explores sale|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/klondike-inn-site-owner-explores-sale|accessdate=March 16, 2017|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pinnacle===
Pinnacle was to include 1,100 condominium units in two 36-story gold glass towers that would be adjoined by three [[sky bridge]]s, which would contain units themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pinnacle Las Vegas|url=http://www.vegastodayandtomorrow.com/pinnacle.htm|website=VegasTodayAndTomorrow.com|accessdate=May 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mar27/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pinnacle-Lawsuit&gt;{{cite news|last=Illia|first=Tony|title=Condo-hotel project faces class action lawsuit|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/condo-hotel-project-faces-class-action-lawsuit/|accessdate=May 10, 2017|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vantage/&gt; Plans were announced for Pinnacle in March 2005. At that time, the mixed-use project would include two 40-story condominium towers, standing 410 feet, to be built on a {{convert|12|acre|abbr=on|sing=on}} property at the southwest corner of West Tropicana Avenue and Cameron Avenue, across from [[The Orleans]] hotel-casino.&lt;ref name=Pinnacle-Orleans/&gt; The land was occupied at that time by the Falconi Honda automobile dealership,&lt;ref name=Falconi/&gt; which closed in October 2004.&lt;ref name=Pinnacle-Lawsuit/&gt; The property had been owned by Angelo Falconi since 1987.&lt;ref name=Falconi/&gt;

The project was being planned by The Falcon Group, an automobile dealership firm; Elysium Enterprises, a local consulting firm; and Praxis Resources Inc., a development company based in [[Pittsburgh]]. Initial plans included retail, office, and restaurant space, and between 592 and 1,184 condominium units, which would range from {{convert|706|sqft|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1235|sqft|abbr=on}}, with prices between $295,000 and $1.2 million.

The search for a general contractor was underway by November 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith |first=Hubble |title=Condominium craze continues with wave of new projects: Twin-tower Pinnacle, Onyx among projects |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com:80/lvrj_home/2005/Nov-25-Fri-2005/business/4449330.html |work=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=November 25, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908082940/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Nov-25-Fri-2005/business/4449330.html |archivedate=September 8, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with Turner Construction ultimately being chosen.&lt;ref name="Pinnacle-Lawsuit"/&gt; In March 2006, Falcon chose Youngblood Wucherer Sparer Architects to design the project, for which the height had been reduced to 36 stories.

The Falconi Honda dealership was demolished in July 2007, to make room for the new project. Up to that time, Falcon Group had spent two years to plan the project and to obtain entitlements and zoning. At the time, the property for Pinnacle was valued at approximately $8 million per acre. By the time of demolition, [[Marnell Corrao Associates]] had been chosen as the new general contractor. Groundbreaking was scheduled for later in 2007, with the opening planned for spring 2010. Approximately 2,000 construction jobs would be created by the project, which would ultimately employee 500 people upon opening. At that time, condominium prices were from the $400,000 range to more than $1.4 million. Amenities were to include a {{convert|3|acre|abbr=on|sing=on}} wet deck, a movie theater, a health and fitness center, restaurants, a spa, and an office and business center. Michael Bellon, managing partner for The Falcon Group, said, "We wanted to create something that single-handedly redefined the standard of Las Vegas condominium living."&lt;ref name=Falconi&gt;{{cite news|title=Former auto dealership makes way for high-rises|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/former-auto-dealership-makes-way-for-high-rises/|accessdate=May 10, 2017|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=July 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in summer 2007, Marnell Corrao was replaced by Dick Pacific Construction, which also became a partner in the project.&lt;ref name=Pinnacle-Lawsuit/&gt; In October 2007, after repeated delays, groundbreaking was announced to begin by mid-2008.&lt;ref name=Pinnacle-Lawsuit/&gt;

In January 2008, Green Cable LLC filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of Pinnacle condominium buyers. Green Cable sued the development team for an alleged breach of contract, as construction had yet to begin after three years. The lawsuit stated that buyers initially purchased units with the belief that Pinnacle would be opened by August 2008, and sought at least $5 million in returned deposits, damages and attorney's fees. The lawsuit also alleged that the property site was contaminated with high benzene levels because of dropping ground water levels. Sam Schwartz, a principal for Green Cable, said, "Generally, we believe Pinnacle is an excellent project. At this point in time, however, due to the construction delays the project has endured, the buyers I represent, including myself, believe it is in the best interests of all the parties that we go our separate ways."&lt;ref name=Pinnacle-Lawsuit/&gt; Pinnacle's sales gallery closed on February 22, 2008, and the project's cancellation was announced on March 3, 2008.&lt;ref name=Vantage&gt;{{cite news|title=Financing-plan trouble halts Vantage Lofts work|url=https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/financing-plan-trouble-halts-vantage-lofts-work/|accessdate=May 10, 2017|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rocker Tower===
In 1995, Thomas Greenough relocated his bar and restaurant, Tommy Rocker's, to Dean Martin Drive, west of Interstate 15 and the Las Vegas Strip. In 2004, Greenough began receiving numerous offers from condominium developers for the one-acre lot that Tommy Rocker's occupied. Greenough, who was unable to work out a deal with potential developers that would incorporate Tommy Rocker's into any planned condominiums, later chose to build his own condominium on the property. In January 2006, Greenough received approval for a 46-story, 252-unit condominium tower, to be constructed on his property at a cost of $150 million.&lt;ref name=Rockers-LVRJ/&gt; The structure was to be named Rocker Tower.&lt;ref name=Rocker/&gt;

The tower was expected to be the first in southern Nevada to feature a computerized [[Automated parking system|automated parking structure]], with the intention of saving space and decreasing pollution.&lt;ref name=Rockers-LVRJ/&gt; Greenough had toured [[Vienna|Viennese]] parking garages as part of his research into automated-garage technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Katsilometes|first=John|title=Cover-up at Tommy Rocker's returns the notorious club to former form|url=https://lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2009/oct/05/coverup-tommy-rockers-returns-club-former-form/|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=October 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenough hoped that the building would be certified by the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] Green Building Rating System.&lt;ref name=Rockers-LVRJ/&gt; Construction was expected to begin approximately one year later,&lt;ref name=Rockers-LVRJ&gt;{{cite news|last=Packer|first=Adrienne|title=Tommy Rocker joins condo craze: 46-story tower planned for site of sing-along club|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jan-05-Thu-2006/business/5208193.html|work=Las Vegas Review-Journal|date=January 5, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110041721/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Jan-05-Thu-2006/business/5208193.html|archivedate=January 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; with completion expected in summer 2008.&lt;ref name=Rocker&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocker Tower|url=http://www.4275deanmartindrive.com/|website=4275DeanMartinDrive.com|accessdate=March 16, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060328153830/http://www.4275deanmartindrive.com/|archivedate=March 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2006, construction was scheduled to begin in fall 2007, with completion scheduled for January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rocker Tower|url=http://www.4275deanmartindrive.com/|website=4275DeanMartinDrive.com|accessdate=March 16, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060621161056/http://www.4275deanmartindrive.com/|archivedate=June 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2007, Greenough had shelved his plans to build the condominium due to increasing labor and material costs in the Las Vegas Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Katsilometes|first=John|title=John Katsilometes on what might be the next phase of Tommy Rocker's Cantina (Hint: Think topless)|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2007/jan/18/john-katsilometes-on-what-might-be-the-next-phase-/|work=Las Vegas Sun|date=January 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mausoleo Schilizzi''' (Schilizzi Mausoleum), also known as the '''Mausoleum of Posillipo''' or ''Ara Votiva per i Caduti della Patria'' is a monumental [[mausoleum]] built in the 1880s in a [[Egyptian Revival architecture|Neo-Egyptian]] style. It is located at [[Posillipo]], and overlooks the bay from atop a hillside.

==History==
The Mausoleum was commissioned by the wealthy banker Matteo Schilizzi as a mausoleum to be placed in the [[Cemetery of Poggioreale]], and the designs were by [[Alfonso Guerra]]. By the 1920s, the building was bought by the municipality, moved to the present site, and  to serve as a mausoleum for soldiers and patriots. The work was completed by Alfonso's son, Camillo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mausoleo Schilizzi di Napoli Municipalità 1: cosa vedere e visitare, guida con informazioni|url = http://www.geoplan.it/luoghi-interesse-italia/monumenti-provincia-napoli/cartina-monumenti-napoli-municipalita-1/monumenti-napoli-municipalita-1-mausoleo-schilizzi.htm|website = www.geoplan.it|accessdate = 2015-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Caryatids at the entrance are by [[Giovanni Battista Amendola]].

Pinsky’s projects in the public realm have often courted controversy in the press. Notable projects include;

''[https://www.somersethouse.org.uk/whats-on/michael-pinsky-pollution-pods Pollution Pods]'' The artist created a series of interlinked geodesic domes which contained polluted air from cities around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/22/world/europe/uk-pollution-pods.html|title=How’s the Air in London? ‘We Should Be Worried’|last=Yeginsu|first=Ceylan|date=2018-04-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-05-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

During an interview for BBC1, the presenter David Sillito was '''speechless''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' when the artist explained that he could not use genuine London air within the London pod&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/av/entertainment-arts-43820243/art-installation-creates-smelling-pods-of-major-cities-air|title=Could you smell which city you are in?|website=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[https://www.hull2017.co.uk/whatson/events/the-city-speaks/ ''City Speaks'']. The artist constructed a lectern which captured peoples voices and relayed what they said as enormous dot-matrix text ascending Hull's tidal barrier. Many media outlets claimed that the installation was being used for profanities, including a number of sexual references such as "''send nudes''" and "''ejaculation''". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/08/15/rude-words-appear-giant-art-project-hull-computer-doesnt-recognise/|title=Rude words appear on giant art project in Hull because computer doesn't recognise Yorkshire accents|last=Reporters|first=Telegraph|date=2017-08-15|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/city-cultures-tidal-art-project-10987603|title=City of Culture's tidal art project flooded with 'blue' messages|last=Thornton|first=Lucy|date=2017-08-14|work=mirror|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.artnet.com/exhibitions/uk-art-project-city-speaks-1052735|title='Send Nudes': A UK Art Project Is Accidentally Projecting Naughty Phrases Across a Town Square|date=2017-08-16|work=artnet News|access-date=2018-01-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was well received by many, the comedian [[Mark Steel]], said that 'City Speaks' was "''one of my favourite works of art ever''". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09k6pn3|title=Hull, Series 8, Mark Steel's in Town - BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|access-date=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Moaning Lisa'''" is the sixth episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[The Simpsons (season 1)|first season]]. It originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] in the United States on February 11, 1990.&lt;ref name="officialsite"&gt;[http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-1_episode-6 "Moaning Lisa"] ''The Simpsons.com''. Retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The episode was written by [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]], and was directed by [[Wes Archer]].&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season1/page6.shtml Moaning Lisa] ''BBC.co.uk''. Retrieved on August 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Taylor (actor)|Ron Taylor]] guest stars in the episode as [[List of recurring The Simpsons characters#"Bleeding Gums" Murphy|Bleeding Gums Murphy]].&lt;ref name="Al Jean"/&gt; The episode deals with [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s [[Major depressive disorder|depression]] and her attempts to [[sublimation (psychology)|sublimate]] it by playing her [[saxophone]]. It received positive reviews from television critics.

==Plot==
[[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] wakes up one morning [[Sadness|saddened]]. At school, she gets in trouble with her music teacher for improvising, and becomes reluctant to play dodgeball in gym. At home, [[Homer Simpson|Homer]] and [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] pummel each other at video boxing, but despite Homer's attempts, he is unable to defeat Bart. Homer and [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] try to cheer Lisa up, but she is consumed with [[existentialism]] and worry over all the suffering in the world. In her room, Lisa hears music coming from outside her window. She follows the music through town and meets [[Bleeding Gums Murphy]], a soulful saxophonist playing the [[blues]]. Lisa learns about expressing herself through her music from him, only to be discovered and whisked away by Marge.

Homer goes to the arcade and enlists the help of an arcade boxing expert, while Marge takes Lisa to band practice. She tells Lisa to smile no matter how she feels inside, to suppress her emotions in order to be popular, and that happiness will follow. But when she sees Lisa hiding her true feelings and being taken advantage of by her classmates, Marge changes her tune and tells Lisa to be herself and her support helps Lisa to feel genuinely happy. When Homer returns home, he is about to defeat Bart in a rematch but Marge unplugs the game console to announce Lisa's recovery, while Bart declares his retirement as undefeated video boxing champ. Later, the Simpsons visit a jazz club to hear Bleeding Gums Murphy sing a blues number written by Lisa.

==Production==
[[File:Jameslbrooks.jpg|thumb|200px|The idea for "Moaning Lisa" was suggested by [[James L. Brooks]]. |alt=A video camera is being pointed at a bearded man who is wearing glasses. Some other people stand in the background.]]
"Moaning Lisa" was the first episode of the series to focus on Lisa.&lt;ref name=Wilson&gt;{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Stacey |title='The Simpsons' at 500: Untold Stories |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/simpsons-500-episodes-conan-obrien-matt-groening-287864?page=2 |accessdate=2012-02-08 |newspaper=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=2012-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for it was suggested by ''The Simpsons'' producer [[James L. Brooks]], who wanted to do an episode where Lisa was sad but she did not know why.&lt;ref name="Al Jean"/&gt; The writers also felt that they had done several "jokey" episodes on the show and wanted to try something new that was "really emotional and sweet".&lt;ref name="Al Jean"/&gt; The song Lisa sings in this episode later reappeared in expanded form on ''[[The Simpsons Sing the Blues]]'' CD.&lt;ref name="Al Jean"/&gt;

Mr. Largo, Lisa's music teacher, was partly inspired by a music teacher [[Matt Groening]] had as a kid.&lt;ref name="Matt Groening"&gt;{{cite video |people=Groening, Matt |date=2001 |title=The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD commentary for the episode "Moaning Lisa" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designs of the [[Boxing|boxers]] in the video game Homer and Bart play were loosely based on Homer and Bart,&lt;ref name="Al Jean"/&gt; and the referee in the game was based on a character from Matt Groening's ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strip.&lt;ref name="Matt Groening"/&gt; Bleeding Gums Murphy was loosely based on the famous blues musician [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]].&lt;ref name="Al Jean"/&gt; [[Ralph Wiggum]],&lt;ref name="Al Jean"&gt;{{cite video |people=Jean, Al |date=2001 |title=The Simpsons The Complete First Season DVD commentary for the episode "Moaning Lisa" |medium=DVD |publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bleeding Gums Murphy, and [[Simpson family#Extended Bouvier family|Jacqueline Bouvier]] (during Marge's childhood flashback) all make their first (going by production order rather than airdate) appearances on ''The Simpsons'' in this episode.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==Reception==
In its original American broadcast, "Moaning Lisa" finished 34th place in the weekly ratings for the week of February 5–11, 1990 with a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 13.8. It was the highest rated show on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Network]] that week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Blind Faith' and 'Funniest Home Videos' are in Nielsen Top 10 |date=February 16, 1990 |page=7D |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |author=De Atley, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors of the book ''I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide'', Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: "Certain scenes of this, the most syrupy of ''Simpsons'' episodes, sent viewers raised on the later seasons scurrying to the bathroom. Yes, the final moments may give you goosepimples, and are a world away from the anti-schmaltz normally associated with the series, but there is still much to recommend here. In fact, the Homer–Bart subplot is more successful than the main storyline; Homer's nightmare about their relationship is genuinely disturbing."&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 2.5/5 and added: "Lisa develops much of her future personality in this episode. The family dynamic is starting to fall into place, as is the relationship between Homer and Lisa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202012353/http://www.wdbgproductions.com/cinerama/reviews/simpsonsseason1.htm |url=http://www.wdbgproductions.com/cinerama/reviews/simpsonsseason1.htm |title=The Complete First Season |accessdate=2011-09-15 |archivedate=2009-02-02 |date=2001-09-25 |author=Grelck, David B. |publisher=WDBGProductions}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that "overall, this was a pretty drab episode" and added that "it had some moments, such as the videogame boxing matches between Homer and Bart, but Lisa lacked the strength at this point to carry an entire show."&lt;ref name="dvdmg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdmg.com/simpsonsseasonone.shtml |title=The Simpsons: The Complete First Season (1990) |date=|accessdate=2008-08-29 |first=Colin |last=Jacobson |publisher=DVD Movie Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bobbio flasks ampullae VIc.jpg|thumb|A flask from [[Bobbio]], with the ''[[Myrrhbearers|Women at the empty tomb]]'']]
The '''Monza ampullae''' form the largest collection of a specific type of Early Medieval [[pilgrimage]] [[ampullae]] or small flasks designed to hold holy oil from pilgrimage sites in the [[Holy Land]] related to the life of Jesus.  They were made in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], probably in the fifth to early seventh centuries,&lt;ref&gt;"datable more or less between 500 and 650" says Vikan (1998), 241, but ranges vary with authors.&lt;/ref&gt; and have been in the Treasury of [[Monza Cathedral]] north of [[Milan]] in Italy since they were donated by [[Theodelinda]], queen of the [[Lombards]], (c. 570–628).  Since the great majority of surviving examples of such flasks are those in the Monza group, the term may be used to cover this type of object in general.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;

The second largest group was discovered in a burial at [[Bobbio Abbey]], not far from Monza, and names such as '''Monza/Bobbio flasks''' ampullae or [[flagon]]s are among the many terms by which these objects are described.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;  The few other examples are now scattered across the world; this article deals with the whole group of over fifty known ampullae, wherever located.&lt;ref&gt;There are perhaps 36 from Monza, at least 10 from Bobbio (some are fragments), three in Germany and two in the US, plus an example from Catalonia that probably falls rather outside the date range of the others—see locations section below.&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of comparable ampullae from pilgrimage sites outside the [[Holy Land]] have also survived, for example a very similar one from a Syrian site related to [[Saint Sergius]], now in the [[Walters Art Museum]], Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/treasuresofheaven/relics/Pilgrim-Flask-of-St-Sergios.php Comparable ampulla] of St Sergius from Syria, Walters Art Museum, Baltimore (illustrated, right).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ampullae are [[Casting|cast]] in various metals, including [[silver]] (perhaps "silvered" would be more accurate),&lt;ref&gt;Descriptions of the metals used vary widely.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[tin]] and [[lead]], and are mainly of interest because of the images they carry, which come from a period which has left very few traces in art, and was of crucial importance in establishing the [[iconography]] of many Christian subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Leroy, 320–321&lt;/ref&gt; They are also believed to represent buildings and shrines found in [[Jerusalem]] in the sixth and early seventh centuries, giving important evidence as to the early appearance of these.&lt;ref&gt;Hackel, 177&lt;/ref&gt;  They were brought back from the [[Holy Land]] filled with oil which had been used in lamps burning before important pilgrimage shrines.&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264; Beckwith 57–60, and many other of the references&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their ending up in the heart of the institutional church under royal patronage, the ampullae were made as mass-produced souvenirs, probably relatively inexpensive, whose designs reflect the experiences and concerns of pilgrims as well as those of the church.

==General description==
The ampullae are round when seen from the front, with a flattened body giving convex faces and a small neck, often with a fitting round the neck for a chain or cord by which they could be suspended, or perhaps worn. There are records of similar blessed objects, or [[eulogia]], being hung on the bedpost for protection from demons at night,&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 12&lt;/ref&gt; and the oil, or just the relic, was believed to be able to heal the sick when applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1998), 235&lt;/ref&gt;  Often there is a strip in a different metal running round the edge of the faces and up the sides of the neck, with little rings for a suspension cord.  In the Monza examples these strips are secured by wire wound rather untidily round the neck.  A diameter for the main body of about 5–7&amp;nbsp;cm is typical, and in a side view the body swells to a maximum thickness of about 3&amp;nbsp;cm.  Those at Monza are in generally good condition, but those from Bobbio and other examples such as the one at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] are flattened and damaged; they are now mostly black in colour.&lt;ref&gt;Dumbarton Oaks ''''Catalogue of the Byzantine and Early Mediaeval Antiquities'' contains a detailed catalogue description of a single example.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their small size, the images are typically crowded multi-figure compositions, sometimes with extensive depiction of architectural elements, and somewhat crude in execution.  They appear in low [[relief]], typically occupying all the space of the faces on both sides of the ampulla, though some have figureless decoration, usually centred on a cross, on the reverse face. There are often inscriptions and ''[[Titulus (inscription)|tituli]]'' in medieval Greek, many running round the outside of a face, or dividing an upper scene from a lower one.  A smaller scene may occupy the lower part of a face, or scenes may appear in small [[roundel]]s grouped across the overall design.&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 57–59; Dumbarton Oaks. A good illustration of a typical example is at the [http://www.egeriaproject.net/mov_display.aspx?id=179 Egeria website]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subjects==
Subjects were linked with the most famous pilgrimage sites of the Holy Land, and especially [[Jerusalem]], where the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] contained both the greater part of the [[True Cross]] and the Tomb of Christ,&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1998), 241&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an altar dedicated to the [[Adoration of the Magi]].&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264&lt;/ref&gt; Common subjects, which account for the great majority of the designs, are:
*The ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' summarized in a number of scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Monza no. 2, silver, with seven scenes on one side. Schiller I, 26 and fig. 55&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' combined with the ''[[Annunciation to the Shepherds]]''; the ampullae are the first surviving depictions to show both Magi and shepherds together paying homage to the infant Jesus held by his mother, which remain very common throughout the later history of Christian art.  As often later, a balanced composition is created by having the magi to the left of the Virgin and Child, and the shepherds to the right. It has been speculated that the compositions reflect a lost [[mosaic]] then in the [[apse]] of the [[Church of the Nativity, Bethlehem]].&lt;ref&gt;Monza no.1, silver and no.3. See Schiller I, 104 &amp; fig. 258 and Milburn, 264. Beckwith, 57 has an illustration. Though the link with the mosaic remains a common view, Vikan (1998), (p. 241 and elsewhere) discounts such precise derivations, ? perhaps following Grabar.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]''
*The ''[[Crucifixion of Jesus]]'', where ampullae show the emerging depiction of the scene, which was a famously late arrival in the repertory of Christian imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Monza nos. 6, 10, 13, Dumbarton Oaks [https://books.google.com/books?id=P1_BBK-LsesC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;dq=Bobbio+flask&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KGnpS-WCC8v0_Abs8-njCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=Bobbio%20flask&amp;f=false image], and others. Schiller II, 90 and fig. 324;  [http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf Monza no. 6 is fig 21 here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312012759/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf |date=2012-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ampullae often show an empty cross with a bust of Christ above it, and kneeling pilgrims at its foot; this is thought to depict the scene around the large ''[[crux gemmata]]'' installed in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at the time - some therefore prefer to call these scenes the ''[[Adoration of the Cross]]''.  The two thieves are often shown on their crosses even when Christ's central cross has no ''corpus'', as in the Dumbarton Oaks example.
[[File:S. Apollinare Nuovo Marys at Tomb.jpg|thumb|300px|Early 6th century [[mosaic]] in [[San Apollinare Nuovo]], [[Ravenna]] with a depiction of the ''[[Myrrhbearers|Women at the empty tomb]]''  similar to that on ampullae, though reversed and with no [[censer]].]] 
*''Jesus and [[Doubting Thomas]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Monza no. 9, Bobbio no. 10, see Leroy, 322; Milburn, 264&lt;/ref&gt; since these seem to have been sold at Jerusalem, not where the biblical episode was located in tradition, it seems these suggested a link between the experience of Thomas, who doubted until he saw and touched the physical evidence of Christ's wounds, and that of the pilgrim, whose faith was also reinforced by the sight of, and physical contact with, the scenes and [[relic]]s of Christ's life.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Resurrection of Jesus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Monza nos. 10 and 11 both have a ''Crucifixion'' and ''Resurrection'' on one side, and an ''Ascension'' on the reverse. Noga-Banai, 104&lt;/ref&gt; usually represented by the ''[[Myrrhbearers|Women at the empty tomb]]'', with the tomb represented by the "aedicula" or shrine built by [[Constantine I]] within the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on what was believed to be the appropriate spot.  This is now covered or replaced by later accretions, and its 6th century appearance is only known from such representations.&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264. See also the Dumbarton Oaks and Schiller examples, and Monza no. 6 -  [http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf image fi. 21 here] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312012759/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf |date=2012-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Typically, two women approach from the left of the tomb, while an angel sits to its right.  One of the women, perhaps to be identified as [[Mary Magdalene]], often seems to be carrying a [[censer]], suggesting to scholars a reflection of the contemporary rituals performed at the tomb. The door or lid of the tomb, which has been pushed aside by the angel to allow Christ to exit,&lt;ref&gt;according to  {{Bibleref2c|Mt|28:1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be represented by a [[lozenge]] shape, as in the [[mosaic]] at right, apparently reflecting the contemporary display in the aedicula.&lt;ref&gt;as in Monza no. 5, see King&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Ascension of Jesus]]'', usually with the ''[[Pentecost]]'' below.&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264. See also the ''Resurrection'' note above.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Saints, typically on the reverse side, with a ''[[New Testament]]'' scene on the [[obverse]].&lt;ref&gt;Milburn, 264&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourteen of the Monza and Bobbio ampullae combine on one face ''Crucifixions'' above the ''Women at the empty tomb'', which are also on the two faces in other examples.&lt;ref&gt;Dumbarton Oaks&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the flasks, one each at Bobbio and Monza, show a large Christ [[Jesus walking on water|walking on water]] and rescuing [[Saint Peter]] from drowning, as the other apostles watch from a boat, perhaps reflecting the anxieties of the sea voyages many pilgrims faced as they returned home.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1998), 247–248; Milburn, 264&lt;/ref&gt; Another Bobbio scene shows a Virgin [[Orant]] flanked by [[John the Baptist]] and his father [[Zechariah (priest)|Zacharias]].&lt;ref&gt;Pitarakis, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Figures that appear to be images of pilgrims, as a kind of generalised [[donor portrait]], appear in many scenes, usually kneeling,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Dumbarton Oaks&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the emphasis on the pilgrim experience noted above in discussing the ''Doubting Thomas'' scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Peers, 41–42; Vikan (1982), 24–25; Wharton, 26–27; Hackel, 177&lt;/ref&gt;

==Context and style==
[[File:Jerusalem Holy Sepulchre BW 7.JPG|thumb|left|Modern pilgrims at the ''[[aedicule]]'' over the tomb of Christ in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].]]
The ampullae join other small-scale Christian works of art from this period, from which almost no major works have survived, and very few manuscript illuminations.  These include [[amulet]]s, [[devotional medal]]s and other forms of pilgrimage souvenirs.  Many of these are in the cheaper material of [[terracotta]], such as the [[Menas flask]]s that have been found from [[Cheshire]] to the [[Sudan]] and come from [[Abu Mena]] in [[Egypt]], the exceptionally popular shrine of [[Saint Menas]].&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 16&lt;/ref&gt;  Small round terracotta "pilgrimage tokens" or ampullae for oil, water or earth from the Holy Land, are often excavated, and examples of the tokens are also in the Monza treasury; the [[Piacenza Pilgrim]] records that in the 570s earth was kept piled up in the tomb of Christ to be taken by pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982): on earth, 12, on water, 15, on a clay token at Bobbio, 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of these pieces, in the words of John Beckwith, "rate as works of art little more than a [[hot cross bun]]".&lt;ref&gt;Beckwith, 57&lt;/ref&gt;  However few of these works have images with the complexity of those on the ampullae.  There is a small wooden box in the [[Vatican Museums]] containing earth and rocks from the Holy Land, some tied up in cloth and labelled with their site of origin.  The inside of the top cover has five painted scenes from the New Testament relating to the main sites, or sights, on the pilgrimage route, in similar style to the ampullae, and believed to be made in Palestine in around 600.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 18–20; Beckwith, 60; good image [http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf fig. 22 of this thesis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312012759/http://etd.lib.fsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07072009-210837/unrestricted/HostetlerBThesis.pdf |date=2012-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was long thought that the ampullae reflected the style of art of Palestine itself, and as such they became involved in the intense scholarly debate over "Oriental" influences on Early Medieval art, which preoccupied scholars of the subject in the early decades of the 20th century, and for which the style of [[Syria]] and Palestine was a key battleground.  In his monograph of 1957, which for the first time gave scholars good images of all the Monza and Bobbio ampullae, and an extensive analysis of their iconography, [[André Grabar]] proposed instead that they derived from the style of [[Constantinople]] itself, spread to the provinces by Imperial patronage, which is clearly recorded for the major pilgrimage sites.&lt;ref&gt;Leroy&lt;/ref&gt;  This view has gained considerable influence.&lt;ref&gt;See for example Beckwith, 59&lt;/ref&gt; After the Persians under [[Khosrau II]] took and sacked Jerusalem in 614, and the  [[Muslim conquest]] of the region in the 630s, pilgrimages to the Holy Land sites were greatly reduced, and pilgrim souvenirs with them.&lt;ref&gt;Vikan (1982), 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exception of the somewhat variant example from Sant Pere de Casseres (see below), which may be later, it is usually assumed that all the Monza-type ampullae predate the Persian sack, and probably come from the late sixth century, a few years before Theodelinda's reign. After a nearly complete gap of three centuries or so, different styles of pilgrimage souvenirs begin to appear from the 10th century, reflecting rather different pilgrimage experiences and customs.

==Queen Theodelinda's gift==
[[File:Syrian - Pilgrim Token from the Shrine of St Symeon - Walters 481939.jpg|thumb|Syrian pilgrim token in clay from the [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites|shrine of St Symeon]] near [[Aleppo]], 6th century]]
[[Theodelinda]] was a [[Bavaria]]n princess who married [[Authari]], King of the [[Lombards]] in 588.  When he died in 590, she was allowed to choose his cousin [[Agilulf]] as her next husband and the next king. He was baptised, initially as an [[Arian]] like most Lombards, but Theodelinda persuaded him and his son to convert to Catholicism in 603.  Together they founded the cathedral at Monza, and endowed it with many treasures, a collection which has remained unusually intact, and includes the [[Iron Crown of Lombardy]] (strictly only on deposit there initially), the [[Late Antique]] [[Poet and Muse diptych]], a [[Gospel book]] and the collection of ampullae. An early inventory survives, although some objects traditionally associated with Theodelinda may actually be made well after her death in 628, when she was buried at Monza.

The collection in the treasury was famous, and later augmented by other royal gifts.  It was taken to [[Avignon]] during the [[Avignon Papacy]] but later returned. However the ampullae were incorporated in the high altar and forgotten until rediscovered in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Leroy, 320. They were first published in 1794 by Frisi.&lt;/ref&gt; Their identification in the earlier inventories is complicated by the existence of a further set of glass vials, also used for holy oil.  The ''notula'' ("little note"), a very early [[papyrus]] document, now itself regarded as a treasure, records that a cleric called John, during the reign of Pope [[Gregory the Great]] (died 604), transferred (the nature of the transaction, whether a gift from Gregory, or John, or a purchase, is not clear) to Theodelinda small containers with oil that had been in lamps burning before the tombs of saints in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Elsner, 98&lt;/ref&gt;  The saints are listed; it seems that in most cases, but not those of Saints Peter and [[Saint Paul|Paul]], the oil was blended from that used in several places. There is some scholarly confusion as to how this list relates to the glass and metal ampullae.&lt;ref&gt;Compare Burrus, 109 and Elsner, 98. The mentions in other works cited here give further variations.&lt;/ref&gt;  The origin of ampullae other than those produced by John is unknown, although scholars are unanimous that, wherever they went afterwards, the metal ampullae had been made in Palestine. Gregory is recorded as presenting gifts to Theodelinda in 603 after the conversion of Agilulf and his son, and also sending holy oil in ampullae.&lt;ref&gt;Letters of Gregory the Great, 701, note f&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bobbio Abbey]] was founded in 613 by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission|Irish missionary]] [[Saint Columbanus]] in 613, with land and funds from Theodelinda. The Bobbio ampullae were discovered in the 1920s in the [[crypt]] of the abbey church, and are presumed to have been given by Theodelinda or her family.

==Locations==
Apart from the collections at Monza and Bobbio, other examples include two owned by the [[Staatliche Museen]] of [[Berlin]] and one in the [[Landesmuseum Stuttgart]]. Two examples in the United States, one at [[Dumbarton Oaks]] near [[Washington, D. C.]] and one in the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]], appear to be cast from the same mould.&lt;ref&gt;Dumbarton Oaks&lt;/ref&gt;  There is an example with a ''Crucifixion'' and ''Ascension'' in the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]] (clear image online).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learn.columbia.edu/treasuresofheaven/relics/Pilgrim-Flask.php Pilgrim Flask, The Cleveland Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

A single example was found in 1952 at the monastery church of Sant Pere de Casseres, near [[Tavèrnoles]] in [[Catalonia]].  As at Monza, it was discovered within the main altar, adapted as a [[reliquary]] for a piece of bone, and near a glass vial similarly used. It is made of an iron alloy, is rather larger than most at 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm high and 5.7&amp;nbsp;cm wide, and has two handles at the neck.  The decoration is a ''Crucifixion'' on the obverse, and [[Greek cross]] on the reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Arad, 59–60&lt;/ref&gt; This may be later than the Monza and Bobbio ampullae by some considerable time.&lt;ref&gt;Arad suggests the 8th to 10th centuries&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas Andrew Basbanes''' (born May 25, 1943, in [[Lowell, Massachusetts]]) is an American author who writes and lectures widely about books and book culture. His subjects have included the "eternal passion for books" (''A Gentle Madness'');&lt;ref name="MichaelDirda"&gt;Michael Dirda, "Genuine Book Cases," ''Washington Post'', July 30, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; the history and future of libraries (''Patience &amp; Fortitude'');&lt;ref&gt;Merle Rubin, "Can you have too many books?

== Early life and education ==

Nicholas Basbanes is the son of two first-generation Greek-Americans. He graduated from [[Lowell High School (Massachusetts)|Lowell High School]] in 1961, and earned a bachelor's degree in English from [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]], in 1965. Following a year of graduate study at [[Pennsylvania State University]], he did research for his master's thesis in [[Washington, D.C.]], then entered U. S. Navy [[Officer Candidate School]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. He attended the [[Defense Information School]] in the spring of 1968 and received his master's degree in journalism in 1969 while serving aboard the aircraft carrier {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34}} during the first of two combat deployments he made to [[Yankee Station]] in the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], off the coast of Vietnam.&lt;ref name="articles.sun-sentinel.com"&gt;Chauncey Mabe, "The Book On Books: Nicholas Basbanes Brings a Journalist's Training and Sensibility to Writing About, well, Writing, and Books," ''South Florida Sun Sentinel'' (Fort Lauderdale, FL), March 14, 2004.

== Early career ==

Discharged from active duty in 1971, Basbanes went to work as a general assignment reporter for ''The Evening Gazette'' in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]], specializing in investigative journalism. In 1978, he was appointed books editor of a sister publication, the Worcester ''Sunday Telegram'', a full-time position that included writing a weekly column for which he would interview more than a thousand authors over the next twenty-one years.

When Basbanes left the newspaper (by then known as the ''[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]'') in 1991 to complete his first book, he continued writing the column and distributed it through Literary Features Syndicate, an agency that he formed that placed it in more than thirty publications nationwide. Two selections of his literary journalism were collected in ''Editions &amp; Impressions'' (2007) and ''About the Author'' (2010).&lt;ref name="articles.sun-sentinel.com"/&gt;

== Writing ==

Basbanes' first book, ''A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books'', was published in 1995. It has since appeared in eight hardcover editions and more than twenty paperback printings, surprising figures for a work of nonfiction whose topic was dismissed as too arcane for a general readership by many New York editors who had passed on the opportunity to publish it.&lt;ref&gt;William A. Davis, "Bible for Bibliophiles: Basbanes' 'A Gentle Madness' Confounds the Naysayers, " ''Boston Globe'', June 26, 1996, reprinted ''Bates Magazine'', Spring 1997. [http://abacus.bates.edu/pubs/mag/97-Spring/bibliophile.html]  and John Baker, "A Mania for Books," ''Publishers Weekly'', vol. 252, issue 45, November 11, 2005. [http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20051114/20772-a-mania-for-books.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its topic is book collecting, but its focus is human nature – what Basbanes calls the "gentle madness" of [[bibliomania]]. Of the many people profiled in ''A Gentle Madness'', none has created more interest than [[Stephen Blumberg]], arguably the most accomplished book thief of the twentieth century, and to this day a subject of fascination for the bizarre methods he used to steal volumes from more than three hundred libraries in North America.&lt;ref name="MichaelDirda" /&gt;

''A Gentle Madness'' was named a ''New York Times'' notable book of the year,&lt;ref&gt;"Notable Books of the year 1995,"''New York Times,''December 3, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and was a finalist for the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] in nonfiction for1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bookcritics.org/awards/past_awards/#1995%20Awards NBCC Finalists]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the ''Wall Street Journal'' named it one of the most influential works about book collecting published in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703843804575533971996423764 ''Wall Street Journal'', October 9, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, an updated paperback edition and a new electronic version of the book were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.finebooksmagazine.com/a-gentle-madness---a-new-edition.aspx |title=A Gentle Madness - A New Edition! |publisher=Store.finebooksmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2003, with the publication of ''A Splendor of Letters'', Basbanes was already acknowledged as a leading authority on books and book culture. One reviewer commented, "No other writer has traced the history of the book so thoroughly or so engagingly,"&lt;ref&gt;Andre Bernard,"Fear of Book Assasination [sic] Haunts Bibliophile's Musings," ''The New York Observer,'' December 15, 2013. [http://observer.com/2003/12/fear-of-book-assasination-haunts-bibliophiles-musings/]&lt;/ref&gt; and Yale University Press chose him to write its 2008 centennial history, ''A World of Letters'', which chronicled the inside stories of its classic books from conception to production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yalepress.yale.edu/yupbooks/centennial/worldofletters.asp |title=Yale Press Centennial: A World of Letters by Nicolas A. Basbanes |publisher=Yalepress.yale.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basbanes' ninth book, ''On Paper: The Everything of Its Two-Thousand-Year History'',&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Hoffert, "Barbara's Picks, October 2013, Pt. 3: Basbanes, Boyle, Cahill, Drabble, Goleman, Holmes, Lepore, MacGregor, Venter, &amp; Winterson," ''Library Journal'', April 15, 2013.

In addition to his books, Basbanes writes for numerous newspapers, magazines, and journals.  He writes the "Gently Mad" column for ''Fine Books &amp; Collections'' magazine, and lectures widely on book-related subjects.

In July 2015, Basbanes received one of the inaugural grants from the Public Scholar program, a major new initiative from the National Endowment for the Humanities, for his work-in-progress, ''Cross of Snow: The Love Story and Lasting Legacy of American Poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (1807-1882)''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Charles (critic)|Ron Charles]], "Uncle Sam Wants YOU to Read 'Popular' Scholarly Books," ''Washington Post'', The Style Blog, July 28, 2015.[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/wp/2015/07/28/can-the-neh-make-scholarship-popular/]&lt;/ref&gt; The Public Scholar program is designed to promote the publication of scholarly nonfiction books for general audiences.

The [[Texas A&amp;M University Libraries#Cushing Memorial Library and Archives|Cushing Memorial Library and Archives]] of [[Texas A&amp;M University]] acquired Basbanes' papers as the Nicholas A. Basbanes Collection in December 2015. The collection includes archives of Basbanes' professional career as an author and literary journalist, as well as a significant portion of his personal library. Highlights of the collection include research materials related to the writing of his nine books and approximately eight hundred books inscribed to him over the course of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=https://library.tamu.edu/about/news-and-events/2015/12/Basbanes-Collection.html |title=Basbanes Collection Added to Cushing Library |language= |publisher=[[Texas A&amp;M University Libraries#Cushing Memorial Library and Archives|Cushing Memorial Library and Archives, Texas A&amp;M University]] |date=2015-12-07 |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104143426/http://library.tamu.edu/about/news-and-events/2015/12/Basbanes-Collection.html |archivedate=2016-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''parallel import''' is a non-[[counterfeit]] [[good (accounting)|product]] imported from another country without the permission of the [[intellectual property]] owner. Parallel imports are often referred to as [[grey market|grey product]] and are implicated in issues of [[international trade]], and [[intellectual property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/glossary_e/parallel_imports_e.htm|title=WTO - Glossary - parallel imports|website=www.wto.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel importing is based on concept of [[exhaustion of intellectual property rights]]: according to this concept, when the product is first launched on the market in a particular jurisdiction, parallel importation is authorized to all residents in the state in question. Some countries allow it but others do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inta.org/Advocacy/Pages/ParallelImportsGrayMarket.aspx|title=Parallel Imports/Gray Market|website=www.inta.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel importing of pharmaceuticals reduces price of pharmaceuticals by introducing competition; [[TRIPS agreement]] in Article 6 states that this practice cannot be challenged under the WTO dispute settlement system and so is effectively a matter of national discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/factsheet_pharm02_e.htm|title=WTO - Intellectual property (TRIPS) - fact sheet - pharmaceuticals - 2|website=www.wto.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of parallel importing is often advocated in the case of software, music, printed texts and electronic products, and occurs for several reasons:

# Different versions of a product are produced for sale in different markets: the UK edition of [[Top Gear Magazine]] is officially sold in the UK, and [[Top Gear Australia (magazine)|Top Gear Australia]] is officially sold in Australia. However some unofficial distributors in [[Australia]] also sell the UK edition of Top Gear Magazine.
# Companies, either the manufacturer or the distributor, set different [[price points]] for their products in different markets. Parallel importers ordinarily purchase products in one country at a price (P1) which is cheaper than the price at which they are sold in a second country (P2), import the products into the second country, and benefitting from [[arbitrage]], sell the products in that country at a price which is usually between P1 and P2.
# Consumers who are able to obtain more competitively priced items and may be able to avoid local sales taxes, are placed on an even footing with consumers who have less access to overseas sales online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Question ANswered |url=https://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |accessdate=16 November 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515131714/http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |archivedate=15 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Some advocacy groups support parallel importing on the grounds of enhancing the free flow of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825182748/http://www.alia.org.au/advocacy/copyright/your.ques.answered.html |archivedate=25 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International approach==
Parallel importing is regulated differently in different jurisdictions; there is no consistency in laws dealing with parallel imports between countries. Neither the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] nor the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property|Paris Convention]] explicitly prohibit parallel importation.

===Australia===
The Australian market is an example of a relatively small consumer market which does not benefit from the economies of scale and competition available in the larger global economies. Australia tends to have lower levels of competition in many industries and oligopolies are common in industries like banking, supermarkets, and mobile telecommunications.

Private Enterprise will use product segmentation strategies to legally maximise profit. This often includes varying the service levels, pricing and product features to improve so called "fit" to the local marketplace. However this segmentation may mean an identical products at often higher prices. This can be termed "Price Discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Winning entry for the Kirby Cup 2012 {{!}} Saving the right to parallel import in a digital world|url=http://www.alrc.gov.au/winning-entry-kirby-cup-2012-saving-right-parallel-import-digital-world |date=22 Nov 2012 |accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the advent of the Internet, Australian consumers can readily compare prices globally and have been able to identify products exhibiting Price Discrimination, also known as the "[[Australia Tax]]".

In 1991, the Australian Government resolved to remove parallel import restrictions from a range of products except cars. It followed this up with legislation making it legal to source music and software CDs from overseas and import them into Australia. An Australian Productivity Commission report recommended in July 2009 that legislation be extended to legalise the parallel importing of books, with three years' notice for publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hudson|first1=Andrew|title=Australia: Productivity Commission Recommends Removal Of Parallel Import Protection For Books|url=http://www.mondaq.com/australia/article.asp?articleid=83242|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission also recommended abolishing restrictions on parallel importing of cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Charlwood|first1=Sam|title=Cheaper second-hand imported cars a step closer|url=http://www.drive.com.au/motor-news/cheaper-secondhand-imported-cars-a-step-closer-20140214-32prt.html|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Court of Australia [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/FCAFC/2012/130.html decision] shows that parallel imported items with valid trademark are subject to [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/tma1995121/s123.html Section 123 of the Trade Mark Act].

Various Parliament of Australia committees have investigated allegations of Price Discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=House of Representatives Committees|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/committees/house_of_representatives_committees?url=ic/itpricing/subs.htm|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European Union/European Economic Area===
The [[European Union]] (and [[European Economic Area]]) requires the doctrine of international exhaustion to exist between member states (contracting states) but EU legislation for trade marks, design rights and copyright prohibits its application to goods put on the market outside the EU/EEA.

===Germany===
In [[Germany]], the [[Bundesgerichtshof]] has held that the [[exhaustion of rights|doctrine of international exhaustion]] governs parallel importation, subject to the EU rules above.

===Hong Kong===
In Hong Kong, parallel importation is permitted under both, the [[Trade Mark]] and (amended) [[Copyright]] Ordinance before The Copyright (Amendment) Ordinance 2007 came into force 6 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/071212/html/071212en08002.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214013629/http://www.news.gov.hk/en/category/lawandorder/071212/html/071212en08002.htm |archivedate=14 December 2007 |df=dmy-all }} Seven arrested for copyright infringement&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]]'s intellectual property rights law prohibits audiovisual articles marketed for export from being sold domestically, and such sale of "re-imported" CDs are illegal.

===United States===
In the [[United States]], legal precedent has established that parallel importation is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/523/135.html|title=FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of [[Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.]], the US Supreme Court held that the [[first-sale doctrine]] applies to copies of a copyrighted work lawfully made abroad, thus permitting importation and resale of many product categories.

Moreover, Science, State, Justice, and Commerce, and Related Agencies, Appropriations Act of 2006 prohibits future FTAs from categorically disallowing the parallel import of patented products.&lt;ref&gt;Shayerah Ilias, Ian Fergusson, “Intellectual Property Rights and International Trade,” Congressional research Service, February 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Automobiles==
{{mainarticle|Grey import vehicle}}

===United States===
The United States has unique automobile design legislation administered by the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]. Certain car makers find the required modifications too expensive. This creates demand for [[grey import vehicles]], where certain models are modified for individual customers to meet these requirements, at a higher expense than if this were done by the original manufacturer on an [[assembly line]]. This procedure interferes with the marketing scheme of the manufacturer, who might plan to import a less powerful car and force consumers to accept it. The Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act of 1988 basically ended the gray market by requiring manufacturer certification of  U.S.-bound cars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Aaron|title=How To: Win the Car-Importing Game|url=http://blog.caranddriver.com/how-to-win-the-car-importing-game/|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallel-imported foodstuffs, etc.==
Markets for parallel imports and locally made products sometimes exist alongside each other even though the parallel imports are markedly more expensive. This may be for various reasons, but is mostly observed in foodstuffs and toiletry.

Due to the nature of hotels, travellers often have little information on where to shop except in the immediate vicinity. Grocery shops opened to serve brand-name hotels often feature parallel-imported foodstuffs and toiletry to cater to travellers so that they can easily recognise the product they have been using at home.

Foodstuffs and toiletry made from different plants may vary in quality because different plants may use materials or reagents (such as water used for washing, food additives) from different sources, although they are usually subject to the same standards by internal QC or public health authorities. A person may be allergic to the foodstuff or toiletry made by some plants but not others.

To sum up, the major reasons for such a market are:

* Lack of information
* Recognisability
* Avoidance of risk due to products by different plants
&lt;!--Appreciated if someone could improve clarity--&gt;

==Issues==
A manifestation of the philosophical divide between those who support various intellectual property and [[Criticism of intellectual property|those who are critical of it]], is the divide over the legitimacy of parallel importation. Some believe that it benefits consumers by lowering prices and widening the selection and consumption of products available in the [[Market (economics)|market]], while others believe that it discourages intellectual property owners from investing in new and [[innovation|innovative]] products. Some also believe that parallel imports tend to facilitate [[copyright infringement]].

This tension essentially concerns the [[rights]] and [[duty|duties]] of a protected [[monopoly]]. Intellectual property rights allow the holder to sell at a price that is higher than the price one would pay in a [[competition|competitive market]], but by doing so the holder relinquishes sales to those who would be prepared to buy at a price between the monopoly price and the competitive price. The presence of parallel imports in the marketplace prevents the holder from exploiting the monopoly further by [[market segmentation]], i.e. by applying different prices to different consumers.

[[Consumer organisation]]s tend to support parallel importation as it offers consumers more choice and lower prices, provided that consumers retain equivalent legal protection to locally sourced products (e.g. in the form of [[warranty|warranties]] with international effect), and competition is not diminished.

However, such organisations also warn consumers of certain risks in using parallel-imported products. Although the products may have been made to comply with the laws and customs of their place of origin, these products or their use may not comply with those in places where they are used, or some of their functions may be rendered unusable or meaningless (which may needlessly drive up prices). Electronic devices, however, suffer less from this type of risk because newer models support more than one user language.

==Examples==

===Australia===
Importation of [[computer games]] and computer game hardware from [[Asia]] is a common practice for some wholesale and/or retail stockists. Many consumers now take advantage of on-line stores in [[Hong Kong]] and the [[United States]] to purchase computer games at or near half the cost of a retail purchase from the Australian RRP. Often the versions sold by the Asian retailers are manufactured in Australia to begin with. An example is [[Crysis]], which was available from Hong Kong on-line stores for approximately $50 AUD but whose retail cost in Australia was close to $100. Crysis was sold in Asia using identical versions of the game box and disc, right down to including Australian censor ratings on the box.

===Hong Kong===
{{See also|Parallel trading in Hong Kong}}
Importation of [[Colgate (toothpaste)|Colgate]] [[toothpaste]] from [[Thailand]] into [[Hong Kong]]. The goods are bought in markets where the price is lower, and sold in markets where the price of the same goods is, for a variety of reasons, higher. Electronic goods like Apple's [[iPad]] are frequently imported in Hong Kong before they're official and resold to South-East Asian early adopters for a premium.

===New Zealand===
The practice exists of luxury [[automobile|car]] dealers in [[New Zealand]] buying [[Mercedes-Benz]] [[vehicle]]s in [[Malaysia]] at a low price, and importing the cars into New Zealand to sell at a price lower than the price offered by Mercedes Benz to New Zealand consumers.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} There are also many parallel import dealers of electronics hardware. Parallel importing is allowed in New Zealand and has resulted in a significant lowering of margins on many products. {{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===Poland===
There is an opinion, not scientifically proven, but very popular among people in Poland that "Western" washing powders are more effective in cleaning than Polish, because chemistry companies allegedly produce items of higher quality for Western Europe, not as good as for Poland. Because of that, there are companies and online stores importing Western chemistry supplies to Poland (for example from Germany), even if similar brands are available there.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.luna24.pl/produkty/proszki-do-prania,2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pralinka.pl/Chemia-z-niemiec/niemiecki-proszek-do-prania/|title=Proszki do prania z Niemiec - niemiecka chemia pralinka.pl|first=Trol|last=InterMedia|website=www.pralinka.pl|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Federation===
&lt;!-- according to the rg.ru article, external trade volume is 12 times that of internal trade --&gt;
According to [http://bablaw.livejournal.com/ Anatoliy Semyonov], trademark rights exhaustion turned national in 2002, and, as of April 2013, an act is being prepared that could make original goods imported without a permission of the producer officially "counterfeit" (by replacing things on which "a trademark is located illegally" with things "on which an illegally used trademark is located"). He notes that, according to the [[Criminal Code of Russia|Criminal Code]], illegal use of a trademark can be punished up to 6 years of imprisonment; and a similar article in the [[Offences Code of Russia|Offences Code]] makes goods with an illegal copy of a trademark subject to confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===European Union===
Some [[PlayStation Portable|Sony PSP]] video game consoles were imported into the [[European Economic Area]] from Japan up to twelve months prior to the European launch. The unusual component of this example is that some importers were selling the console for a higher price than the intended EU price, taking advantage of the relative monopoly they enjoyed. After the release the console was commonly imported from the USA where it was retailed for much lower price.

Other example are smart phones, which are being imported from China, where an average device can be bought for about $100 while a similar device would be retailed for about 200€ in the EU.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10700">The '''Godecharle prize''' or the '''Godecharle contest''' is a contest for art students, the winners of which are granted a scholarship allocated by the Godecharle Foundation. The conditions for participation are that contestants are less than 35 years old, of Belgian nationality, or members of a country of the  European Community who have lived in Belgium for at least five years.

Napoléon Godecharle (1803-1875) created the Godecharle Foundation on the 15th of March 1871 in remembrance of his father, the prominent sculptor [[Gilles-Lambert Godecharle]] and with the aim of promoting the education and the career of young Belgian artists, either sculptors, painters or architects.

To this end, the Godecharle foundation organizes every other year a contest better-known under its French name, the ''Prix Godecharle'' (the 'Godecharleprijs' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]).

The prize allows young talents, unknown before the award, to become recognized by a panel of experts made up of famous artists. The renown of the contest is based, amongst other things, upon the reputation of the artists who sit on the jury.

The foundation has entrusted a provincial board, the socalled ''Commission provinciale des Fondations de bourses d’études du Brabant'' with the management of the contest and the follow-up exhibitions of the works of participants.

The Godecharle bursaries are allocated by this board, on proposals made up by a jury of renowned artists.

The first contest was organized in 1881. At the start, the competition took place every three years on the occasion of the ''Salons triennaux des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles'' in Belgium. Because of the First World War, the contest was adjourned until 1921. Since 1933, it is held every two years.

The laureates win prize money of 5,000 euros, granted in two instalments over two years. In accordance with its founder’s wishes, the winners have to spend this money on travelling abroad in order to improve their education or to conduct research, traditionally in Italy, the ceaseless return to [[Renaissance]] sources.

==The jury==

Many famous painters, sculptors and architects of these last hundred years have accepted to be members of the jury of the Godecharle contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} '''A. Massin, W. Demulder, P.

Some of them are internationally recognized, including [[Emile Claus]], [[Paul Delvaux]], [[Léon Frédéric]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Constant Permeke]], [[Jean Brusselmans]], [[Louis Van Lint]], [[Victor Bourgeois]],  and [[Pierre Alechinsky]].

The successful careers of some of the winners also boosted the renown of this contest. These winners included personalities such as [[Victor Horta]], [[Egide Rombaux]], [[Victor Rousseau]], [[John Cluysenaar]], [[Tom Frantzen]], [[Olivier Leloup]], [[Guillaume Van Strydonck]], [[Éliane de Meuse]], [[Taf Wallet]], [[Alfred Bastien]] and [[Isidore Opsomer]].

A significant milestone in the history of the contest was the first grant of the prize to a female sculptor in 1921.  The winner [[Éliane de Meuse]] was only twenty-two years old when she won the prize.&lt;ref&gt;'''[[Benezit Dictionary of Artists]]''' ''Dictionnaire critique et documentaire des peintres, sculpteurs, dessinateurs et graveurs de tous les temps et de tous les pays, édition refondue sous la direction de Jacques BUSSE'', Editions Gründ – 60 rue Mazarine – 75006 Paris  - 1999 - Dépôt legal: mars 1999, {{ISBN|978-2-7000-3049-5}} (Tome 9)

'''''Rear Window''''' is a 1954 American [[Technicolor]] [[mystery film|mystery]] [[thriller film]] directed by [[Alfred Hitchcock]] and written by [[John Michael Hayes]] based on [[Cornell Woolrich]]'s 1942 [[short story]] "It Had to Be Murder". Originally released by [[Paramount Pictures]], the film stars [[James Stewart]], [[Grace Kelly]], [[Wendell Corey]], [[Thelma Ritter]], and [[Raymond Burr]]. It was screened at the 1954 [[Venice Film Festival]].

The film is considered by many filmgoers, critics, and scholars to be one of Hitchcock's best&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017289-rear_window/ |title=Rear Window Movie Reviews, Pictures&amp;nbsp;– Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films ever made]]. It received four [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and was ranked number 42 on AFI's [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies|100 Years...100 Movies list]] and number 48 on [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)|the 10th-anniversary edition]], and in 1997 was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] in the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".

==Plot==
Recuperating from a broken leg, adventuresome professional photographer L. B. "Jeff" Jefferies (Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair in his [[Greenwich Village]] apartment. His rear window looks out onto a courtyard and several other apartments. During a powerful [[heat wave]], he watches his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool.

He observes a flamboyant dancer he nicknames "Miss Torso"; a single middle-aged woman he calls "Miss Lonelyhearts"; a talented, single, middle-aged composer-pianist; several married couples; a female sculptor; and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.

Jeff's sophisticated, beautiful [[socialite]] girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), visits him regularly, as does his insurance company's nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella wants Jeff to settle down and marry Lisa, but Jeff is reluctant.

One night during a thunderstorm, Jeff hears a woman scream "Don't!" and then the sound of breaking glass. Later, he is awakened by thunder and observes Thorwald leaving his apartment. Thorwald makes repeated late-night trips carrying his sample case. The next morning, Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and then sees Thorwald cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Later, Thorwald ties a large trunk with heavy rope and has moving men haul it away. Jeff discusses all this with Lisa and with Stella.

Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. Jeff explains this to his friend Tom Doyle ([[Wendell Corey]]), a [[New York City Police Department|New York City Police]] detective, and asks him to do some research. Doyle finds nothing suspicious; apparently, Mrs. Thorwald is upstate, and picked up the trunk herself.

[[File:Rearwindow trailer 1.jpg|thumb|left|267px|[[James Stewart]] as L.B. Jefferies]]

Soon after, a neighbor's dog is found dead with its neck broken. The dog's owner yells across the courtyard, complaining of her neighbors' callous disregard of others. All the neighbors run to their windows to see what is happening, except for Thorwald, whose cigar can be seen glowing as he sits quietly in his dark apartment.

Certain that Thorwald is also guilty of killing the dog, Jeff asks Lisa to slip an accusatory note under his door, so Jeff can watch his reaction when he reads it. Then, as a pretext to get Thorwald out of his apartment, Jeff telephones him and arranges a meeting at a bar. He believes Thorwald buried something incriminating in the courtyard flower bed, and killed the dog to stop it digging there, so when Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella dig up the flowers; they find nothing.

Much to Jeff's amazement and admiration, Lisa then climbs the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and clambers in through an open window. When Thorwald returns and grabs Lisa, Jeff calls the police, who arrive in time to save her by arresting her. Jeff sees Lisa has her hands behind her back, wiggling her finger with Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring on it. Thorwald notices this, and, realizing that she is signaling to someone, he sees Jeff across the courtyard.

Jeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message. Stella heads for the police station to post bail for Lisa. When his phone rings, Jeff assumes it is Doyle, and says that the suspect has left the apartment. When no one answers, Jeff realizes that Thorwald himself had called, and is heading over to confront him. When Thorwald enters, Jeff repeatedly sets off his camera flashbulbs, temporarily blinding him. However, Thorwald grabs Jeff and manages to push him out of the open window, as Jeff is yelling for help. Police officers enter the apartment as he falls to the ground; other officers have run over to break his fall. Thorwald confesses to the police soon afterward.

A few days later, the heat has lifted, and Jeff rests peacefully in his wheelchair, now with casts on both legs. The lonely neighbor is chatting with the pianist in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.

Lisa reclines on the daybed in Jeff's apartment, wearing jeans and apparently reading a book titled ''Beyond the High Himalayas''. As soon as Jeff falls asleep, Lisa puts the book down and happily opens a fashion magazine.

==Production==
The film was shot entirely at Paramount studios, which included an enormous indoor set to replicate a Greenwich Village courtyard. Set designers [[Hal Pereira]] and Joseph MacMillan Johnson spent six weeks building the extremely detailed and complex set, which ended up being the largest of its kind at Paramount. One of the unique features of the set was its massive drainage system, constructed to accommodate the rain sequence in the film. They also built the set around a highly nuanced lighting system which was able to create natural-looking lighting effects for both the day and night scenes. Though the address given in the film is 125 W. Ninth Street in New York's Greenwich Village, the set was actually based on a real courtyard located at 125 [[Christopher Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lumenick|first=Lou|authorlink=Lou Lumenick|title=Inside the real Greenwich Village apartment that inspired ''Rear Window''|url=https://nypost.com/2014/08/06/inside-the-real-greenwich-village-apartment-that-inspired-rear-window/|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=21 November 2016|date=7 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the meticulous care and detail put into the set, careful attention was also given to sound, including the use of natural sounds and music that would drift across the courtyard and into Jefferies' apartment. At one point, the voice of [[Bing Crosby]] can be heard singing "To See You Is to Love You", originally from the 1952 Paramount film ''[[Road to Bali]]''. Also heard on the soundtrack are versions of songs popularized earlier in the decade by [[Nat King Cole]] ("[[Mona Lisa (Nat King Cole song)|Mona Lisa]]", 1950) and [[Dean Martin]] ("[[That's Amore]]", 1952), along with segments from [[Leonard Bernstein]]'s score for [[Jerome Robbins]]' ballet ''[[Fancy Free (ballet)|Fancy Free]]'' (1944), [[Richard Rodgers]]' song "[[Lover (song)|Lover]]" (1932), and "''M'appari tutt'amor''" from [[Friedrich von Flotow]]'s opera ''[[Martha (opera)|Martha]]'' (1844), most borrowed from Paramount's music publisher, [[Famous Music]].

Hitchcock used costume designer [[Edith Head]] on all of his Paramount films.

Although veteran Hollywood composer [[Franz Waxman]] is credited with the score for the film, his contributions were limited to the opening and closing titles and the piano tune ("Lisa") written by one of the neighbors, a composer ([[Ross Bagdasarian Sr.|Ross Bagdasarian]]), during the film. This was Waxman's final score for Hitchcock. The director used primarily "diegetic" sounds—sounds arising from the normal life of the characters—throughout the film.&lt;ref&gt;DVD documentary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
A "benefit world premiere" for the film, with [[United Nations]] officials and "prominent members of the social and entertainment worlds"&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F0CE6DD113EE53BBC4D53DFBE66838F649EDE A ''Rear Window'' View Seen at the Rivoli], an August 5, 1954, review from ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; in attendance, was held on August 4, 1954, at the Rivoli Theatre in New York City, with proceeds going to the American–Korean Foundation (an aid organization founded soon after the end of the [[Korean War]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=9835 Statement by the President on the fund-raising campaign of the American–Korean Foundation] from a [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] website&lt;/ref&gt; and headed by [[Milton S. Eisenhower]], brother of [[President Eisenhower]]).

The movie was released wide on September 1, 1954.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The movie went on to earn an estimated $5.3 million at the [[North America]]n box office in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''Variety Weekly'', January 5, 1955&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics and is considered one of Hitchcock's finest films. On the website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has been universally praised, garnering a [[List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes|100% certified fresh rating]], based on 61 reviews, with the consensus stating that "Hitchcock exerted full potential of suspense in this masterpiece."

Critic [[Bosley Crowther]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' attended the benefit premiere, and in his review called the film a "tense and exciting exercise"&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; and Hitchcock a director whose work has a "maximum of build-up to the punch, a maximum of carefully tricked deception and incidents to divert and amuse." Crowther also notes: "Mr. Hitchcock's film is not 'significant.' What it has to say about people and human nature is superficial and glib, but it does expose many facets of the loneliness of city life, and it tacitly demonstrates the impulse of morbid curiosity. The purpose of it is sensation, and that it generally provides in the colorfulness of its detail and in the flood of menace toward the end."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called it "just possibly the second-most entertaining picture (after ''[[The 39 Steps (1935 film)|The 39 Steps]]'') ever made by Alfred Hitchcock" and a film in which there is "never an instant&amp;nbsp;... when Director Hitchcock is not in minute and masterly control of his material."&lt;ref name="time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,891018,00.html The New Pictures], an August 2, 1954 review from ''Time'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; The same review did note "occasional studied lapses of taste and, more important, the eerie sense a Hitchcock audience has of reacting in a manner so carefully foreseen as to seem practically foreordained."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called the film "one of Alfred Hitchcock's better thrillers" which "combines technical and artistic skills in a manner that makes this an unusually good piece of murder mystery entertainment."&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/1954/film/reviews/rear-window-1200417736/ Review of ''Rear Window''], a July 14, 1954 article from ''Variety'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 30 years after the film's initial release, [[Roger Ebert]] reviewed the Universal re-release in October 1983, after Hitchcock's [[Probate|estate was settled]]. He said the film "develops such a clean, uncluttered line from beginning to end that we're drawn through it (and into it) effortlessly. The experience is not so much like watching a movie, as like&amp;nbsp;... well, like spying on your neighbors. Hitchcock traps us right from the first&amp;nbsp;... And because Hitchcock makes us accomplices in Stewart's [[voyeurism]], we're along for the ride. When an enraged man comes bursting through the door to kill Stewart, we can't detach ourselves, because we looked too, and so we share the guilt and in a way we deserve what's coming to him."&lt;ref name="ebert"&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19831007/REVIEWS/310070302/1023 1983 Review of ''Rear Window'' re-release] by Roger Ebert&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
In his book, ''Alfred Hitchcock's "Rear Window"'', [[John Belton]] addresses the underlying issues of [[voyeurism]], that are evident in the film. He asserts "''Rear Window's'' story is "about" spectacle; it explores the fascination with looking and the attraction of that which is being looked at."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Belton |editor1-first=John |last1=Belton |first1=John |author1link=John Belton |title=Alfred Hitchcock's 'Rear Window' |chapter=Introduction: Spectacle and Narrative |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=1 |oclc=40675056 |isbn=9780521564236 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voyeurism===

John Fawell notes in Dennis Perry's book, ''Hitchcock and Poe: The Legacy of Delight and Terror'', that Hitchcock "recognized that the darkest aspect of voyeurism…is our desire for awful things to happen to people...to make ourselves feel better, and to relieve ourselves of the burden of examining our own lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitchcock and Poe: the Legacy of Delight and Terror|last=Perry|first=Dennis|publisher=The Scarecrow Press, Inc.|year=2003|isbn=978-0810848221|location=Maryland|pages=135–153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Master of Terror challenges the audience, forcing them to peer through his rear window and become exposed to, as Donald Spoto calls it in his 1976 book ''The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: Fifty Years of His Motion Pictures'', the "social contagion" of acting as voyeur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Art of Alfred Hitchcock: Fifty Years of His Motion Pictures|last=Spoto|first=Donald|publisher=Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc.,|year=1976|isbn=978-0385418133|location=Garden City, N.Y.|pages=237–249|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an explicit example of a condemnation of voyeurism, Stella expresses her outrage at Jeffries' voyeuristic habits, saying, "In the old days, they'd put your eyes out with a red hot poker" and "What people ought to do is get outside and look in for a change."

One climactic scene in the film portrays both the positive and negative effects of voyeurism. Driven by curiosity and incessant watching, with Jeffries watching from his window, Lisa sneaks into Thorwald's second-floor apartment, looking for clues, and is apprehended by him. Jeffries is in obvious anxiety and is overcome with panic as he sees Thorwald walk into the apartment and notice the irregular placement of the purse on the bed. Jeffries anxiously jitters in his wheelchair, and grabs his telephoto camera to watch the situation unfold, eventually calling the police because Miss Lonelyhearts is contemplating suicide in the neighboring apartment. Chillingly, Jeffries watches Lisa in Thorwald's apartment rather than keeping an eye on the woman about to commit suicide. Thorwald turns off the lights, shutting off Jeffries' sole means of communication with  and protection of Lisa; Jeffries still pays attention to the pitch-black apartment instead of Miss Lonelyhearts. The tension Jeffries feels is unbearable and acutely distressing as he realizes that he is responsible for Lisa now that he cannot see her. The police go to the Thorwald apartment, the lights flicker on, and any danger coming toward Lisa is temporarily dismissed. Although Lisa is taken to jail, Jeffries is utterly mesmerized by her dauntless actions.

With further analysis, Jeffries' positive evolution understandably would be impossible without voyeurism—or as Robin Wood puts it in his 1989 book ''Hitchcock's Films Revisited'', "the indulging of morbid curiosity and the consequences of that indulgence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hitchcock's Films Revisited|last=Wood|first=Robin|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1989|isbn=978-0231126953|location=|pages=100–107|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In 1997, ''Rear Window'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". By this time, the film interested other directors with its theme of voyeurism, and other reworkings of the film soon followed, which included [[Brian De Palma]]'s 1984 film ''[[Body Double]]'' and [[Phillip Noyce]]'s 1993 film ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]''.

''Rear Window'' was restored by the team of [[Robert A. Harris]] and [[James C. Katz]] for its 1999 limited theatrical re-release (using Technicolor dye-transfer prints for the first time in this title's history) and the Collector's Edition DVD release in 2000.

[[American Film Institute]] included the film as number 42 in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies]], number 14 in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills]], number 48 in [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)]] and number three in [[AFI's 10 Top 10]] (Mysteries).&lt;ref name="AFI's 10 Top 10"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[American Film Institute]] | title = AFI's 10 Top 10 | date = 2016 | url = http://www.afi.com/10top10/category.aspx?cat=5 | accessdate=August 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ownership==
Ownership of the copyright in Woolrich's original story was eventually litigated before the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Stewart v. Abend]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Stewart v. Abend|volume=495|page=207|pin=|year=1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was copyrighted in 1954 by Patron Inc., a production company set up by Hitchcock and Stewart. As a result, Stewart and Hitchcock's estate became involved in the Supreme Court case, and Sheldon Abend became a producer of [[Rear Window (1998 film)|the 1998 remake]] of ''Rear Window''.

''Rear Window'' is one of several of Hitchcock's films originally released by Paramount Pictures, for which Hitchcock retained the copyright, and which was later acquired by Universal Studios in 1983 from Hitchcock's estate.

==Home media==
On September 4, 2012, Universal Studios Home Entertainment re-released ''Rear Window'' to DVD, as a Region 1 widescreen DVD. This release includes the items available in the 2001 release.

On May 6, 2014, Universal Studios Home Entertainment released ''Rear Window'' to Blu-ray format, with slightly expanded extras.

==In popular culture==
''Rear Window'' has been repeatedly retold, parodied, or referenced.

* ''[[Disturbia (film)|Disturbia]]'' (2007) is a modern-day retelling, with the protagonist ([[Shia LaBeouf]]) under [[house arrest]] instead of laid up with a broken leg, and who believes that his neighbor is a [[serial killer]] rather than having committed a single murder. On September 5, 2008, the Sheldon Abend Trust sued [[Steven Spielberg]], [[DreamWorks]], [[Viacom]], and [[Universal Studios]], alleging that the producers of ''Disturbia'' violated the copyright to the original Woolrich story owned by Abend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/09/09/us-disturbia-suit-idUSN0844655020080909 |title=Spielberg ripped off Hitchcock Classic |accessdate=September 8, 2008 |author=Edith Honan |date=September 8, 2008 |publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/articles/djf500/200809081651DOWJONESDJONLINE000605_FORTUNE5.htm |title=2nd UPDATE: Trust Files Copyright Lawsuit Over ''Disturbia'' |accessdate=September 8, 2008 |author=Chad Bray |date=September 9, 2008 |publisher=CNN Money}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 21, 2010, the U.S. District Court in ''Abend v.

'''Television'''
* The set of the film was the basis for a comedy sketch on a 2009 episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.

[[Bobby Moynihan]] was also featured as Alfred Hitchcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/rear-window/1175849/ |title=Rear Window &amp;#124; Video &amp;#124; Saturday Night Live |publisher=NBC |date= |accessdate=December 4, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615142325/http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/rear-window/1175849 |archivedate=June 15, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Rear Window'' was remade as a [[Rear Window (1998 film)|television movie of the same name]] in 1998, with an updated storyline in which the lead character is paralyzed and lives in a high-tech home filled with assistive technology. Actor [[Christopher Reeve]], himself paralyzed as a result of a 1995 horse-riding accident, was cast in the lead role. The telefilm also starred [[Daryl Hannah]], [[Robert Forster]], [[Ruben Santiago-Hudson]], and [[Anne Twomey]]. It aired November 22, 1998, on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television network.
* In an episode of ''[[Get Smart]]'' titled "Greer Window" (season four, episode 24, original airdate March 15, 1969), [[Maxwell Smart]] is confined at home, recuperating from a gunshot wound to his hindquarters.

A '''shell grotto''' is a type of [[folly]], a [[grotto]] decorated with [[sea shell]]s.

==History==
The shell grotto was a popular feature of British country house in the 17th and 18th centuries.
It arose from the influence of the [[Rococo style]] (which used swirling motifs similar to sea shells)&lt;ref name=HJ&gt;Hazelle Jackson, ''Shell Houses and Grottoes'' ( 2001) {{ISBN|9780747805229}} ([http://www.londongardenstrust.org/features/grotto.htm abstract])&lt;/ref&gt;
and mimicry of architectural features from the [[Italian renaissance]] (themselves copies from Classical times).
The idea of a grotto was originally a means to enhance a dank [[undercroft]], or provide an antechamber before a ''[[piano nobile]]'', but later became a garden feature independent of the house.
Early grottos were mainly of the shell grotto type, mimicking a sea-cave, or in the form of a [[nymphaeum]]; later there was a move towards more naturalistic cave-like grottoes.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

The first recorded shell grotto in England was at [[Whitehall Palace]]; [[James VI and I|James I]] had it built in the undercroft of the [[Banqueting House, Whitehall|Banqueting House]] in 1624, but it hasn't survived. Two years later the [[Duke of Bedford]] had a shell room built at [[Woburn Abbey]], featuring shell mosaics and carved stone.
This, and another at [[Skipton Castle]], built in 1627, are the only surviving examples from the 17th century.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt; 

Shell grottoes were an expensive luxury: The grotto at [[Oatlands Park]] cost £25,000 in 1781 and took 11 years to build; and at [[Fisherwick|Fisherwick Park]] the [[Marquess of Donegall]] spent £10,000 on shells alone in 1789.&lt;ref name=Tat&gt;[https://www.tatler.com/article/the-poshest-grottoes  ''The 4 poshest garden grottoes''] [[Tatler]] 27 July 2015; retrieved 30 July 2018&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shell Grotto, Margate|The Grotto]] at [[Margate]] has 2000 square feet of mosaic, using some 4.6 million shells.

By the end of the 18th century fashion had moved on to more naturalistic cave-like structures, before falling out of favour altogether. Many were demolished or have fallen into disrepair, but 
some 200 grottos of all types are known to have survived in some form in the UK.&lt;ref name=HJ/&gt;

The '''Southsea Shakespeare Actors''' are an amateur theatrical group in [[Southsea]], [[Hampshire]], England. It has produced nearly 200 plays, of which around two-thirds have been by [[William Shakespeare]]. It was the first amateur group in the world to perform the entire Shakespearean canon of plays, during the 1960s, for which it has won a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] - it repeated this achievement in 1997. Members have included the naval historian [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White]].

It was formed in 1947 at St Peter's Hall in the town, with [[Donald Wolfit]] as its patron and K. Edmonds Gateley MBE as both its founder and its first main director. It moved to the [[South Parade Pier|South Parade Pier Theatre]] in the 1950s. When the Pier declined it moved again to the [[Kings Theatre, Southsea|King's Theatre]], performing there during the 1970s and early 1980s before becoming more multi-venue (albeit with the Portsmouth Arts Centre and [[New Theatre Royal]] as its main venues). It has also played at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] and has a youth wing, known as 'Upstage!'.

'''Street art''' is [[visual art]] created in public locations, usually unsanctioned artwork executed outside of the context of traditional art vans. Other terms for this type of art include "independent public art", "post-graffiti", and "neon-graffiti", and is closely related with [[urban outfiters]] and [[guerrilla art]].&lt;ref&gt;"Neo-graffiti" is a term coined by ''Tokion Magazine'' in the title of its Neo-Graffiti Project 2000, which featured "classic" subway surfers  graffiti artists working in new media; others have called this phenomenon "urban art." A discussion by the [[Wooster Collective]] on terminology can be found at [http://www.woostercollective.com/2004/01/what_the_hell_should_we_call_i.html WoosterCollective.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rafael"&gt;[http://www.lataco.com/interview-rafael-schacter-author-amazing-new-book-world-atlas-street-art-graffiti/ http://www.lataco.com] Interview with Rafael Schacter, Author of ''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti'' ("...I prefer to use the term Independent Public Art...").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/08/books/review/city-as-canvas-and-the-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti.html https://www.nytimes.com] Aerosol Art ("...in favor of the catchall 'Independent Public Art'").&lt;/ref&gt; Common forms and media include [[aerosol paint|spray paint]] [[graffiti]], [[stencil graffiti]], [[flyposting|wheatpasted poster art]], [[sticker art]], [[street installation]]s, and [[sculpture]]. [[video design|Video projection]] and [[yarn bombing]] have also gained some popularity near the turn of the 21st century.

Street art is a form of artwork that is displayed in a community on its surrounding buildings, streets, trains, and other publicly viewed surfaces. Many instances come in the form of guerrilla art, which is composed to make a public statement about the society that the artist lives within. The work has moved from the beginnings of graffiti and vandalism to new modes where artists work to bring messages, or just simple beauty, to an audience.&lt;ref name=Antonova2014&gt;Antonova, Maria. 2014. "Street Art." Russian Life 57(5):17&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artists use "smart vandalism" as a way to raise awareness of social and political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Student art project is vandalism for a cause |url=http://www.whas11.com/news/local/Student-art-project-is-vandalism-for-a-cause-86760522.html |work=The Herald-Times |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320000018/http://www.whas11.com/news/local/Student-art-project-is-vandalism-for-a-cause-86760522.html |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others simply see urban space as an untapped format for personal artwork, while others may appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with installing illicit artwork in public places. A common motive is that creating art in a format which utilizes public space allows artists who may otherwise feel disenfranchised to reach a much broader audience than other styles or galleries would allow.

Whereas traditional [[graffiti]] artists have primarily used [[aerosol paint|spray paint]] to produce their work, "street art" encompasses many other media, such as [[LED art]], [[mosaic]] tiling, [[stencil graffiti|stencil art]], [[sticker art]], [[reverse graffiti]], [[Lock On (street art)|"Lock On" sculptures]], [[street installations]], [[wheatpaste|wheatpasting]], [[woodblock graffiti|woodblocking]], [[yarn bombing]], and [[rock balancing]].&lt;ref&gt;For the development of style in the aerosol paint medium, as well as an examination of the political, cultural, and social commentary of its artists, see the anthropological history of New York subway graffiti art, ''Getting Up: Subway Graffiti in New York'', by Craig Castleman, a student of [[Margaret Mead]], The MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; New media forms such as projection onto large city buildings are an increasingly popular tool for street artists—and the availability of cheap hardware and software allows street artists to become more competitive with corporate advertisements. Much like open source software, artists are able to create art for the public realm from their personal computers, similarly creating things for free which compete with companies making things for profit.&lt;ref&gt;Geek Graffiti: A Study in Computation, Gesture and Graffiti Analysis&lt;/ref&gt;

Some observers use the term "independent public art" to describe a type of street art, which can also include work in remote places that may not be visited by an audience, and may also be short-lived. An ephemeral instance of colored smoke in the forest, or a precarious [[Rock balancing|rock balance]] are examples.&lt;ref name="Rafael"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Filippo"&gt;[http://www.filippominelli.com/project/silence-shapes/ http://www.filippominelli.com] Filippo Minelli "''Silence/Shapes''."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Schacter, author of "''The World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti''", September, 2013; {{ISBN|9780300199420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brooklynstreetart.com/theblog/2014/02/13/rafael-schacter-and-his-world-atlas-of-street-art-and-graffiti/ http://www.brooklynstreetart.com] Rafael Schacter and His "World Atlas of Street Art and Graffiti."&lt;/ref&gt; Some work has been installed underwater.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bANKhbe1Vg8 https://www.youtube] Gravity Glue 2015; (Underwater [[Rock balancing|Rock balance]] at 3:55).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins===
Slogans of protest and political or social commentary graffitied onto public walls are the precursor to modern graffiti and street art, and continue as one aspect of the genre. Street art in the form of text or simple iconic graphics in the vein of corporate icons become well-known yet enigmatic symbols of an area or an era.&lt;ref name="Village Voice Mott"/&gt; Some credit the ''[[Kilroy Was Here]]'' graffiti of the World War II era as one such early example; a simple line-drawing of a long-nosed man peering from behind a ledge. Author [[Charles Panati]] indirectly touched upon the general appeal of street art in his description of the "Kilroy" graffiti as "outrageous not for what it said, but where it turned up".&lt;ref name="Kilroy"/&gt; Much of what can now be defined as modern street art has well-documented origins dating from [[New York City]]'s [[Graffiti in the United States|graffiti boom]], with its infancy in the 1960s, maturation in the 1970s, and peaking with the spray-painted full-car subway train murals of the 1980s centered in the [[Bronx]].

As the 1980s progressed, a shift occurred from text-based works of early in the decade to visually conceptual street art such as [[Richard Hambleton|Hambleton]]'s shadow figures.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, David (1990) ''Soho Walls&amp;nbsp;– Beyond Graffiti'', Thames &amp; Hudson, NY, {{ISBN|978-0-500-27602-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period coincides with [[Keith Haring]]'s subway advertisement subversions and [[Jean-Michel Basquiat]]'s [[SAMO]] tags. What is now recognized as "street art" had yet to become a realistic career consideration, and offshoots such as [[stencil graffiti]] were in their infancy. [[Flyposting|Wheatpasted]] poster art used to promote bands and the clubs where they performed evolved into actual artwork or copy-art and became a common sight during the 1980s in cities worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}
The group working collectively as [[AVANT]] were also active in New York during this period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Katherine | last=Drasher | title=Avant's on the Street | date=1983-06-30 | work =The Villager | url =http://avant-streetart.com/avant_street_art_press_nyc_80s.htm | pages =31–32 | accessdate = 2009-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Punk rock music's subversive ideologies were also instrumental to street art's evolution as an art form during the 1980s.  Some of the anti-museum mentality can be attributed to the ideology of [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti]] who in 1909 wrote the "[[Manifesto of Futurism]]" with a quote that reads, "''we will destroy all the museums''."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zox-Weaver|first=Annalisa|date=June 1, 2015|title=Institutional Guerilla Art Open Access: The Public Sculpture of Florentijn Hofman|url=|journal=Sculpture Review|volume=3|issue=p 22-26|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many street artists claim we do not live in a museum so art should be in public places with no tickets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Early iconic works===
[[File:Houston Street at the Bowery 2008.jpg|thumb|The 2010 recreation of [[Keith Haring]]'s original 1982 mural; New York City's [[Bowery Mural]] wall at [[Houston Street]] and the [[Bowery]]]]
The northwest wall of the intersection at [[Houston Street]] and the [[Bowery]] in New York City has been a target of artists since the 1970s. The site, now sometimes referred to as the [[Bowery Mural]], originated as a derelict wall which graffiti artists used freely. [[Keith Haring]] once commandeered the wall for his own use in 1982. After Haring, a stream of well-known street artists followed, until the wall had gradually taken on prestigious status. By 2008, the wall became privately managed and made available to artists by commission or invitation only.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

A series of murals by [[René Moncada]] began appearing on the streets of [[SoHo]] in the late 1970s emblazoned with the words ''[[I AM THE BEST ARTIST Rene|I AM THE BEST ARTIST]]''. René has described the murals as a thumb in the nose to the art community he felt he'd helped pioneer but by which he later felt ignored by.&lt;ref name="Village Voice Mott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Tierney" /&gt; Recognized as an early act of "art provocation",&lt;ref name="NYPress" /&gt; they were a topic of conversation and debate at the time, and related legal conflicts raised discussion about intellectual property, artist's rights, and the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="Leagle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Landes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginsburgh" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lerner" /&gt; The ubiquitous murals also became a popular backdrop to photographs taken by tourists and art students, and for advertising layouts and Hollywood films.&lt;ref name="SoHo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoHo NY" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Film" /&gt;
''IATBA'' murals were often defaced, only to be repainted by René.&lt;ref name="NYPress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoHo2" /&gt;

Some street artists have earned international attention for their work and have made a full transition from street art into the mainstream art world&amp;nbsp;— some while continuing to produce art on the streets. [[Keith Haring]] was among the earliest wave of street artists in the 1980s to do so. Traditional graffiti and street art motifs have also increasingly been incorporated into mainstream advertising, with many instances of artists contracted to work as graphic designers for corporations. Graffiti artist [[Eric Haze|Haze]] has provided font and graphic designs for music acts such as the [[Beastie Boys]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]]. [[Shepard Fairey]]'s street posters of then-presidential candidate [[Barack Obama]] were reworked by special commission for use in the presidential campaign. A version of the artwork also appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine. It is also not uncommon for street artists to start their own merchandising lines.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Street art has become more accepted by the general public, likely due to its artistic recognition and the high-profile status of [[Banksy]] and other artists. This has led street art to become one of the 'sights to see' in many European cities. Some artists now provide tours of local street art and are able to share their knowledge, explaining the ideas behind many works, the reasons for tagging and the messages portrayed in a lot of graffiti work. 
Berlin, London, Paris, Hamburg and other cities all have popular street art tours running all year round. In London alone there are supposedly ten different graffiti tours available for tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Incredible street art tours | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/picturegalleries/9880046/Incredible-street-art-tours.html | accessdate = 2015-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these organisations, such as Alternative London,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Means|first1=Gary|title=Alternative London Street Art Guides|url=http://www.alternativeldn.com/best_london_tours/london_street_art_tour_guides.php|website=alternativeldn.com|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ParisStreetArt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paris Underground|url=http://undergroundparis.org/street-art-tours-paris|website=undergroundparis.org|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; AlternativeBerlin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alternative Berlin|url=http://alternativeberlin.com/about|website=alternativeberlin.com|accessdate=26 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; pride themselves on working with local artists, so visitors can get an authentic experience and not just a rehearsed script.

Many of these guides are painters, fine-art graduates and other creative professionals that have found the medium of street art as a way to exhibit their work. With this commercial angle they are able to let people in to the world of street art and give them more of an understanding of where it comes from. It has been argued that this growing popularity of steet art has made it a factor in [[gentrification]].&lt;ref&gt;Bross, F. (2017): [https://www.academia.edu/33405765/Beer_Prices_Correlate_with_the_Quality_of_Illegal_Urban_Art._A_Case_Study_on_the_Relationship_Between_Street_Art_and_Gentrification_in_a_Berlin_Neighborhood Beer Prices Correlate with the Quality of Illegal Urban Art. A Case Study on the Relationship Between Street Art and Gentrification in a Berlin Neighborhood]. Mimeo.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legality and ethics ===
Street art can have its own set of legal issues. The parties involved can include the artist, the city or municipal government, the intended recipient, and the owner of the structure or the medium where the work was displayed. One example is a case in 2014 in Bristol England, which exhibits the legal, moral, and ethical questions that can result. The ''Mobile Lovers'' by [[Banksy]] was painted on plywood on a public doorway, then cut out by a citizen who in turn was going to sell the piece to garner funds for a Boys Club. The City government in turn confiscated the artwork and placed it in a museum. Banksy, hearing of the conundrum then bequeathed it to the original citizen, thinking his intentions were genuine. In this case, as in others, the controversy of ownership and public property, as well as the issues of trespassing and vandalism are issues to be resolved legally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salib|first=Peter|date=Fall 2015|title=The Law of Banksy: Who Owns Street Art?|url=|journal=University of Chicago Review|volume=  82|issue= 4 p293|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Street art, guerilla art, and graffiti==
Graffiti is characteristically made up of written words that are meant to represent a group or community in a covert way and in plain sight. The tell tale sign of street art is that it usually includes images, illustrations, or symbols that are meant to convey a message.&lt;ref name="Bloch2015"&gt;Bloch, Stefano. 2015. "Street Art, Public City: Law, Crime and the Urban Imagination." Urban Studies (Sage Publications, Ltd.) 52(13):2500-2503.&lt;/ref&gt; While both works are meant to represent or tell a message to viewers, one difference between the two comes in the specific viewers that it is meant for. One trait of street art that has helped to bring it to positive light in the public eye is that the messages shown in these public spaces are usually made to be understandable to all.&lt;ref name=Bloch2015/&gt;

While both of these types of art have many differences, there are more similarities than their origins. Both graffiti and street art are works of art that are created with the same intent. Most artists, whether they are working anonymously, creating an intentionally incomprehensible message, or fighting for some greater cause are working with the same ambitions for popularity, recognition, and the public display or outpouring of their personal thoughts, feelings, and/or passions.&lt;ref name=Bloch2015/&gt;

The term street art is described in many different ways, one of which is the term "guerrilla art." Both terms describe these public works that are placed with meaning and intent. They can be done anonymously for works that are created to confront taboo public issues that will result in backlash, or under the name of a well-known artist. With any terminology, these works of art are created as a primary way to express the artist's thoughts on many topics and public issues.&lt;ref name=Campos2015&gt;Campos, Ricardo. 2015.

One defining trait or feature of street art is that it is created on or in a public area without or against the permission of the owner.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt; This is a trait which falls in line with that of graffiti. A main distinction between the two comes in the second trait of street art or guerrilla art, where it is made to represent and display a purposefully uncompliant act that is meant to challenge its surrounding environment.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt; This challenge can be granular, focusing on issues within the community or broadly sweeping, addressing global issues on a public stage.

This is how the term "guerilla art" was associated with this type of work and behavior. The word ties back to guerilla warfare in history where attacks are made wildly, without control, and with no rules of engagement. This type of warfare was dramatically different than the previously formal and traditional fighting that went on in wars normally. When used in the context of street art, the term guerilla art is meant to give nod to the artist's uncontrolled, unexpected, and often unnamed attack on societal structure or norms.&lt;ref name="Sisko2015"/&gt;

=== Guerilla sculpture ===

[[File:Rubber Duck in Los Angeles.JPG|thumb|''Rubber Duck'' by Florentijn Hofman]]

Guerilla sculpture is the placement of sculptures in street settings without official approval; it developed from street art in England in the late 20th century.&lt;ref name=Sisko2015/&gt;  In addition to the nontraditional setting of the works of art involved, there are also many different techniques used in the creation of this art work. The artists tend to work illegally and in secrecy to create and place these works in the dark of night, cloaked in mystery regarding their origins and creators. The sculptures are used to express the artist's views and to reach an audience that would not otherwise be reached through more traditional methods of displaying one's work to the public. In performing these acts of artistic expression, they are not working to gain acceptance or love of the people that they reach, but at times may even anger those who view their work.&lt;ref name=Sisko2015/&gt;

An example is the overnight appearance of an unsanctioned sculpture of [[Edward Snowden]] onto a column in [[Fort Greene Park]] in New York City.&lt;ref name="Sisko2015"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sisko|first=|date=Summer 2015|title=Guerilla Sculpture: Free Speech and Dissent|url=|journal=Sculpture Review|volume= 64|issue= 2|pages=26–35|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other cases the sculptures integrate two-dimensional backdrops with a three-dimensional component, such as one by Banksy titled ''Spy Booth'' (2014).  The backdrop was painted on a wall in Cheltenham, England and featured [[Cold War|Cold-War]] spy characters adorned in trench coats and fedoras, with spy accoutrements, microphones, and reel-to-reel tape decks.  These characters appeared to be [[phone tap|tapping into]] a broken telephone booth.&lt;ref name="Sisko2015"/&gt;

A deviation from unsanctioned street sculpture is "institutionalized guerilla sculpture", which is sanctioned by civic authorities and can be commercialized. One such artist from the Netherlands is [[Florentijn Hofman]], who in 2007 created ''[[Rubber Duck (sculpture)|Rubber Duck]]'', a colossal rendition of the childhood tub-toy. The [[Guardians of Time (art)|Guardians of Time]] guerrilla dOCUMENTA are social sculptures by [[Manfred Kielnhofer]].

==Public acceptance==
[[File:27 club Graffiti in Tel Aviv.jpg|thumb|[[27 Club Graffiti in Tel Aviv]] blurs the lines between public art and graffiti]]Although this type of art has become a staple of most cities around the world, the popularity of this form of artistic expression was not always so apparent as it is today. In recent years, street art has undergone a major transformation in public opinion to even become a socially accepted and respected accent to the public places that they adorn.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015&gt;Bacharach, Sondra. 2015. "Street Art and Consent." British Journal of Aesthetics 55(4):481-495&lt;/ref&gt;  Even with this push for public acceptance, the act of defacing public property with any and all message, whether it is considered art or not, has yet to become permitted or approved by the government.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt;  Today's street art, while common and growing in acceptance, is largely placed in a middle ground between an act that is against the law and a beautifully respected act of artistic expression.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In the beginning, graffiti was the only form of street art that there was and it was widely considered to be a delinquent act of territorial marking and crude messaging. Initially, there was very clear divisions between the work of a street artist and the act of tagging a public or private property, but in recent years where the artists are treading the line between the two, this line has become increasingly blurred.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015 /&gt;  Those who truly appreciate the work of famed street artists or street works of art, are in acceptance of the fact that this art would not be the same without the medium being the street. The works are subject to whatever change or destruction may come due to the fact that they are created on public or private surfaces which are neither owned by the artist or permitted to be worked on by the property owners. This acceptance of the potential impermanence of the works of art and the public placement of the uncondoned works are what contribute to the meaning of the piece and therefore, what helps the growth of street art popularity.&lt;ref name=Bacharach2015/&gt;

== Free art movement ==

The '''free art movement''' is the practice of artists leaving art in public places as street art, as well as being free for the public to remove and keep. The artwork is usually tagged with a notice stating it is free art, and either with the artist's name or left anonymously. The movement was reinvigorated by British artist [[My Dog Sighs]] coining the term "Free Art Fridays" and actively participating in the movement, which has since spread internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Johnathen Duran, [https://mic.com/articles/30569/free-art-friday-a-global-art-movement-everyone-can-appreciate Free Art Friday: A Global Art Movement Everyone Can Appreciate] mic.com, March 21, 2013 [retrieved 3 Dec 2016]&lt;/ref&gt; Clues to the location of artworks are sometimes left on [[social media]] to combine [[Treasure hunt (game)|treasure hunting]] with art.&lt;ref&gt;Holly Roberts, [http://www.redandblack.com/culture/month-long-art-scavenger-hunt-free-art-movement-comes-to/article_1752f2b2-fc2b-11e5-b1f6-cbc8592908a3.html Month-long art scavenger hunt, Free Art Movement, comes to Classic City], TheRed&amp;Black, Apr 7, 2016 [retrieved 3 Dec 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is distinct from the [[free culture movement]] as the artist retains full copyright for the work.

==Around the globe==
[[File:Ervin Hervé - Lóránth - Thankyoubudapest (1).JPG|thumb|''Thankyoubudapest'' (Hervé)]]
Street art exists worldwide. Large cities and regional towns of the world are home to some form of street art community, from which pioneering artists or forerunners of particular mediums or techniques emerge. Internationally known street artists travel between such locations to promote and exhibit their artwork.

===North America===

In '''[[Manhattan]]''', "post-graffiti" street art grew in the 1980s from the then largely vacant neighborhoods of [[SoHo]] and the [[Lower East Side]]. The [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] art district became another locale, with area galleries also hosting formal exhibitions of street artist's work. In '''[[Brooklyn]]''', the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]] and [[Dumbo, Brooklyn|Dumbo]] neighborhoods&amp;nbsp;— especially near the waterfront&amp;nbsp;— are recognized street art sites.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Kugel (9 March 2008) [http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/03/09/travel/09weekend.html "To the Trained Eye, Museum Pieces Lurk Everywhere"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Programs in the [[Pennsylvania]] cities of '''[[Philadelphia]]''' and '''[[Pittsburgh]]''' provide funding to agencies who employ street artists to decorate city walls. The [[Mural Arts Program]] established in 1984 has helped Philadelphia earn praise as the "City of Murals".
The project was initiated to encourage graffiti artists toward a more constructive use of their talents. Murals backed by [[The Sprout Fund]] in Pittsburgh were named the "Best Public Art" by the ''[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muralarts.org/about/history |title=History &amp;#124; Mural Arts Program |publisher=Muralarts.org |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hoff| first = Al| title = Best Public Art: Sprout Fund Murals| newspaper = [[Pittsburgh City Paper]]| date = 14 December 2006 | url = http://www.pittsburghcitypaper.ws/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A20486 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art created in conjunction with the [[Living Walls (conference)|Living Walls]] street art conference, which Atlanta hosts annually, were spared.

'''[[São Paulo]]''' is also home to an internationally recognized street art scene.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

An abundance of buildings slated for demolition provide blank canvases to a multitude of artists, and the authorities cannot keep up with removing artists output. "Population density" and "urban anxiety" are common motifs expressed by "Grafiteiros" in their street art and ''[[pichação]]'', rune-like black graffiti, said to convey feelings of class conflict.

Influential Brazilian street artists include Claudio Ethos, [[Os Gêmeos]], Vitche, Onesto, and Herbert Baglione.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, Simon (29 January 2012) [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/29/world/americas/at-war-with-sao-paulos-establishment-black-paint-in-hand.html "At War With São Paulo’s Establishment, Black Paint in Hand"], ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Claudio Ethos"/&gt;

Street art came to '''[[Sweden]]''' in the 1990s and has since become the most popular way to establish art in public space.
The 2007 book "Street Art [[Stockholm]]", by Benke Carlsson, documents street art in the country's capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlsson|first1=Benke|title=Street art Stockholm|date=2007|publisher=Ström|location=Stockholm|isbn=9789171260765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The street art scene of '''[[Finland]]''' had its growth spurt from the 1980s onwards, until in 1998 the city of [[Helsinki]] began a ten-year zero tolerance policy which made all forms of street art illegal, punishable with high fines, and enforced through private security contractors. The policy ended in 2008, after which legal walls and art collectives have been established.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

[[Wheatpaste]] and stencil graffiti art in '''[[Denmark]]''' increased rapidly after visits from [[FAILE (artist collaboration)|Faile]], Banksy, [[Ben Eine]], and Shepard Fairey between 2002–2004, especially in urban areas of [[Copenhagen]] such as [[Nørrebro]] and [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.v1gallery.com/exhibition/archive Gallery housing mentioned street artists] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131120005648/http://www.v1gallery.com/exhibition/archive |date=20 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Copenhagen is home of [[Tejn (artist)|TEJN]], the artist credited with introducing the [[Lock On (street art)|Lock On]] street art genre.

Since the collapse of communism in 1989, street art became prevalent in '''[[Poland]]''' throughout the 1990s. In the city of [[Łódź]] a permanent city exhibition was financed in 2011, under the patronage of Mayor Hanna Zdanowska, called "Urban Forms Gallery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eugene |url=http://www.mymodernmet.com/profiles/blogs/polish-city-embraces-street-art |title=Polish City Embraces Street Art – My Modern Metropolis |publisher=Mymodernmet.com |date=29 September 2011 |accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition included work from some of Poland's elite street artists as well as globally known artists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2205">[[Michael Tippett]]'s '''Symphony No. 4''' was written in 1977 and first performed by the [[Chicago Symphony Orchestra]], and conducted by Sir Georg Solti. It was dedicated to Tippett's biographer and friend, Ian Kemp.

==Form==
It is written in one movement divided into seven sections:
#Introduction and exposition
#Development 1
#Slow movement
#Development 2
#[[Scherzo]] and [[Trio (music)|trios]]
#Development 3
#Recapitulation

In terms of form, it combines [[sonata]] and [[Fantasia (music)|fantasia]] forms, as well as that of the [[symphonic poem]].

==Tippet's periods==
Tippett called the work "a birth to death piece".&lt;ref&gt;Notes to "Tippett:Symphonies Nos 2&amp;4" with CD issued with  'BBC Music Magazine' Volume III No 6.&lt;/ref&gt; This is emphasized by a "breathing effect", either from tape or sampler, particularly prominent at the beginning and the end of the symphony, with a single, unaccompanied intake of breath as its conclusion.

Stylistically, the Fourth Symphony unites all previous stylistic tendencies in Tippett's work: the [[counterpoint]] and gentle lyricism of his first creative period and the angular, spiky modernism of his second period, thus creating a third and final period. Tippett quotes the opening of this Symphony in his Piano Sonata No. 4.

== Instrumentation ==
Tippett's score calls for a large orchestra consisting of: 
* 2 [[flute]]s (both doubling [[piccolo]]s), 2 [[oboe]]s, [[cor anglais]], 2 [[clarinet]]s, [[bass clarinet]], 2 [[bassoon]]s, [[contrabassoon]] 
* 6 [[French horn|horns]], 3 [[trumpet]]s, 3 [[trombone]]s, 2 [[tuba]]s 
* [[timpani]], Percussion (requires 4 players): [[snare drum]], [[tenor drum]], [[bass drum]], [[Tom-tom drum|tom-tom]]s, [[cymbal]]s, [[wood block]], [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], [[xylophone]], [[marimba]], [[vibraphone]], [[glockenspiel]], [[tubular bells]], [[maraca]]s, [[claves]] 
* [[harp]], [[piano]], [[Magnetic tape|tape]] or [[sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]] (breathing effect)
* [[string section|string]]s

'''''That Which That Orphan Saw''''' ({{lang-fa|آنک آن یتیم نظر کرده}}) is a novel by Iranian author [[Mohammad Reza Sarshar]] about the life of [[Mohammad]], the [[prophet]] of [[Islam]]. Sarshar has attempted to describe the tumultuous and unique life of Mohammad in the novel. [[Muslim]]s believe that Mohammad was the last prophet and the most complete human being. ''That Which That Orphan Saw'' has received numerous awards and has been reprinted many times in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tasnimnews.com/Home/Single/687073 |title=That Which That Orphan Saw in Amazon |author=|date= |website= |publisher= Tasnim|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sooremehr.ir/fa/book/1360/That-Which-That-Orphan-Saw |title=That Which That Orphan Saw |author=Staff writer(s)|date= |website=Sureye Mehr Publication |publisher= |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for writing the novel came to Sarshar in 1980 because he believed that there were no valuable life stories about Mohammad available for teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://farsi.khamenei.ir/book-content?id=19424 |title=The idea for writing "from the light land" |author=Staff writer(s)|date= |website=Official website of Khamnenei |language=Persian|accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 8th reprinting was published in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.khabaronline.ir/detail/366334/culture/book |title=یتیم نظرکرده در آمازون، دست خدا در تهران |author=|date= |website=khabaronline.ir |language=Persian|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was translated to English by James C. Klark.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite web|title=That Which That Orphan Saw|url=https://www.amazon.com/That-Which-Orphan-Saw/dp/6001757496|website=Amazon|accessdate=3 August 2017|language=English|date=23 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Narrative==
The first part of ''That Which That Orphan Saw'' starts with dream of [[Abdul-Muttalib]] in which he is ordered to dig the [[Zamzam Well]]. He finds the place to dig near [[Mecca]] which he about heard in his dream. The [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]] are against digging the well and ask Abdul-Muttalib not to do this. Finally they agree to visit a priest and accept his judgement. The priest lives outside of Mecca. Some of the Quraysh head towards the place of the priest along with Abdul-Muttalib. They miss the way and come across a difficult situation so that they let Abdul-Muttalib dig the well. Abdul-Muttalib finds a treasure while digging the well. The Quraysh tribe believe that the treasure belongs to all of them and so they decide to equitably share each part of the treasure. The 8th reprinting was published in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iqna.ir/fa/news/1464356 |title=ترجمه عربی جلد دوم "آنک آن یتیم نظر کرده" امسال به پایان می‌رسد |author=|date= |website=iqna.ir |language=Persian|accessdate=11 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable point in this part of the book is the importance of having sons from the viewpoint of the families; and that Abdul-Muttalib wished to have many sons in order to protect himself from the invasions. When, after years his dream comes true he decides to sacrifice one of his sons based on his covenant with God. His dearest son, [[Abdullah ibn Abdul-Muttalib|Abdullah]] is chosen by chance to be sacrificed. When he tries to sacrifice his son they prohibit him and advise him to visit a priestess, as a neutral person, and accept her judgement.

The priestess tells them to choose the sacrifice between Abdullah and certain number of [[camel]]s by chance and increase the number of the camels by ten if Abdullah is chosen firstly. "Repeat this up to the time the camels are chosen", the priestess says. Abdul-Muttalib acts on the recommendation of the priestess and finally kills 300 camels and Abdullah survives.
Abdullah marries a woman and she gives birth to a son. He moves towards [[Syria (region)|Sham]] and becomes sick near [[Medina|Yathrib]] and passes away in Yathrib. Consequently, Mohammad is born without a father.
The promised prophet of the [[apocalypse]] is mentioned in different parts of the book.

'''''The Coming Global Superstorm''''' ({{ISBN|0-671-04190-8}}) is a 1999 book by [[Art Bell]] and [[Whitley Strieber]], which warns that [[global warming]] might produce sudden and catastrophic [[climate|climatic]] effects.

* First, the [[Gulf Stream]] and [[North Atlantic drift]] would generate a cordon of warm water around the [[North Pole]], which in turn, holds in a frozen mass of Arctic air.
* Second, if the North Atlantic drift [[Shutdown of thermohaline circulation|were to shut down]], that barrier would fail, releasing a flood of frozen air into the [[Northern Hemisphere]], causing a sudden and drastic temperature shift.

The book discusses a possible cause of the failure of the Gulf Stream: the melting of the [[polar ice cap]]s could drastically affect the [[salinity]] of the North Atlantic drift by dumping a large quantity of freshwater into the world's oceans.

Bell and Strieber explain the possibility that such current destabilizations have occurred before, as well as seemingly impossible engineering feats by the ancients. Among their examples is the island city of [[Nan Madol]]. The book claims that its construction, with exacting tolerances and extremely heavy basalt materials, necessitates a high degree of technical competency. Since no such society exists in the modern record or even, in legend, the society must have been destroyed by dramatic means.

While other explanations beside a global [[meteorological event]] are possible, a correlating evidence set is presented in the woolly mammoth. Strieber and Bell assert that since mammoths have been found preserved with food still in their mouths and undigested in their stomachs, these animals must have been killed quickly, in otherwise normal conditions. They were preserved so well by quick freezing, which is taken as evidence of a rapid onset of a global blizzard or similar event.

Interspersed with the analytical parts of the book are a series of interlinked short fictional scenarios, written in italics, describing what might transpire today if a destabilization of the North Atlantic Current were to occur. The fictional accounts of "current events" as the meteorological situation deteriorates provided background and inspiration for the 2004 science fiction film ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]''. Indeed, some events from the book are portrayed in the film with little modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/05/0518_040518_dayafter.html|title=National Geographic News: Day After Tomorrow Movie: Could Ice Age Occur Overnight?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show''''', sometimes called '''''The Burns and Allen Show''''', is a half-hour television series broadcast from 1950 to 1958 on [[CBS]]. It stars [[George Burns]] and [[Gracie Allen]], one of the most enduring acts in entertainment history. [[Burns and Allen]] were headliners in [[vaudeville]] in the 1920s, and radio stars in the 1930s and 1940s. Their situation comedy TV series received [[Emmy Award]] nominations throughout its eight-year run.

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
A  half-hour TV series broadcast October 12, 1950&amp;nbsp;– September 22, 1958, on [[CBS]], ''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show'' was initially staged live and broadcast every other Thursday at 8 pm ET. In fall 1952, it became a weekly series filmed on the West Coast. From March 1953 through September 1958, ''The Burns and Allen Show'' aired Mondays at 8 pm ET.&lt;ref name="Brooks"&gt;Brooks, Tim, and Earle Marsh, ''[[The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows 1946–Present|The Directory to Prime Time Network TV Shows 1946–Present]]''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1988 (fourth edition); {{ISBN|0-345-35610-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|280–281}}

The show was an immediate success.&lt;ref name="NYT GA obit"&gt;"Gracie Allen Dead; Comedianne Was 58". ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 29, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; Six episodes were produced live from the [[Brooks Atkinson Theatre|Mansfield Theatre]] in New York, with the stage set as the Burns's living room. The show relocated to the [[CBS Columbia Square]] facilities in Hollywood beginning with the seventh episode.&lt;ref name="Irvin"&gt;Irvin, Richard, ''George Burns Television Productions: The Series and Pilots, 1950–1981''. [[Jefferson, North Carolina]]: [[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland &amp; Company Inc., Publishers]], 2014. {{ISBN|9780786494866}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|20–21}}

Ever the businessman, Burns realized it would be more efficient to do the series on film; the half-hour episodes could then be syndicated. From that point on, the show was filmed at General Service Studios without a live audience present; however, each installment was screened before an audience to provide live responses prior to the episodes being broadcast. With 291 episodes, the show had a long network run through 1958 and continued in syndicated reruns for years.

The sets were designed to look like the couple's real-life residence. An establishing shot of the actual house on Maple Drive in [[Beverly Hills, California]], was often used. Although extensively remodeled, that house still exists today—including the study over the garage where George would "escape" from Gracie's illogical logic. Burns lived in the house until his death in 1996, at the age of 100.

One [[running gag]] of the TV show involved a closet full of hats belonging to various visitors to the Burns household, who would slip out the door unnoticed and leave their hats behind rather than face another round with Gracie. The format had George watching all the action (standing outside the [[proscenium]] arch in early live episodes; watching the show on TV in his study towards the end of the series) and breaking the [[4th wall|fourth wall]] by commenting upon it to the viewers. Another running gag was George's weekly "firing" of announcer [[Harry Von Zell]] after he turned up aiding, abetting, or otherwise not stopping the mayhem prompted by Gracie's illogical logic.

During the course of the eight-year run, the TV show had remarkable consistency in its cast and crew.  The episodes were produced and directed by [[Ralph Levy]] (1950–53); [[Fred DeCordova|Frederick de Cordova]], later director of NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' (1953–56); and [[Rod Amateau]] (1956–58). The original writing staff consisted of Sid Dorfman, Harvey Helm, [[Paul Henning]], and William Burns (George's brother). Later writers included Nate Monaster, Jesse Goldstein, Norman Paul, and Keith Fowler. The associate producer was Al Simon, the director of photography was [[Philip Tannura]], A.S.C., and the editor was Larry Heath. The show's primary sponsor was [[Carnation Evaporated Milk]], later alternating with [[B.F. Goodrich Company|B.F. Goodrich]] (1952–55, 1956–57), and [[General Mills]], for [[Betty Crocker]] (1955–56, 1957–58).

[[Bea Benaderet]] carried over from the ''[[Burns and Allen]]'' radio show, portraying neighbor Blanche Morton, but over the course of the series, four different actors played her husband. The character's first name was "Harry", the same first name as the real-life announcer [[Harry Von Zell]], requiring the writers to craft dialogue that would distinguish the two characters' names. Blanche's husband Harry Morton was first portrayed by [[Hal March]] (October–December 1950), then [[John Brown (actor)|John Brown]] (January–June 1951), and after that, [[Fred Clark]], until 1953 and Larry Keating until 1958. In one episode, "Morton Buys Iron Deer/Gracie Thinks George Needs Glasses", George walks on-stage and freezes the scene just before Harry's entrance and explains that Clark has left the show to perform on [[Broadway show|Broadway]]. He introduces [[Larry Keating]], who enters, and then calls over Bea Benaderet to introduce the two saying, "This is Larry Keating and he is going to be your husband now". The pair greet and chat briefly, complimenting each other on their previous work. George remarks that if they are going to be so nice to each other, no one will believe they are married. Burns then gives a cue, Blanche resumes her position, and the scene continues where it stopped as if nothing had happened. The new Harry enters and Blanche hits him in the head with a catalog for spending $200 to buy an iron deer.

Also appearing in the TV series were Burns and Allen's two children. [[Ronnie Burns (actor)|Ronnie]], adopted in 1935, and Sandra, adopted the year before,&lt;ref&gt;"Burns and Allen Adopt Boy". ''The New York Times'', September 28, 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Life"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a1MEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA87&amp;lpg=PA87&amp;dq=Life+magazine+Gracie+Ends+Act+with+George&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fHFosZcTLQ&amp;sig=D9T8CuTQt_zDADJ0YUpxfX7fIIM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=59ZgVKLABoepyQTM9IKYDw&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Life%20magazine%20Gracie%20Ends%20Act%20with%20George&amp;f=false|title=Gracie Ends Act with George|publisher=''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''|date=September 22, 1958|pages=88–93|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; first appeared in the third-season episode, "Uncle Clyde Comes to Visit" (January 1, 1953), playing themselves. The teenagers are in the Burns living room, threading a [[16&amp;nbsp;mm film|16&amp;nbsp;mm]] projector with that night's episode. In voiceover, George introduces them, and tells the audience that they have been away at school and that is why we have not met them before. Ronnie made a guest appearance on the episode, "Gracie Gives Wedding in Payment of a Favor" (October 18, 1954), playing a character named Jim Goodwin, and was introduced to the audience at the episode's conclusion. Ronnie joined the regular cast October 10, 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Val, "News of Television", ''The New York Times'', September 25, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; playing himself, but cast as a young drama student who tended to look askance at his parents' comedy style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0122863|title=Ronnie Burns profile|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, Sandra, declined becoming a regular member of the cast, although she appeared in a few episodes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1567506|title=Sandra Burns profile|publisher=Internet Movie Database|accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a classmate of Ronnie. In one episode, Ronnie's drama class puts on a vaudeville show to raise funds for the school. Gracie hosts the show while Ronnie and Sandy deliver an impersonation of their famous parents along with one of their classic routines. Since Ronnie played himself, Gracie closed the segment with a wisecrack: "The boy was produced by Burns and Allen."

Starting in the fall of 1955, Burns and Allen often reappeared after the end of the episode, before a curtain decorated with the names and locations of the various theaters where they headlined in their vaudeville days. They would perform one of their signature "double routines", often discussing one of Gracie's fictional relatives (including "Death Valley Allen" the prospector, "Florence Allen" the nurse, "Casey Allen" the railroad man). Burns always ended the show with, "Say goodnight, Gracie", to which Allen simply replied, "Goodnight." She never said, "Goodnight, Gracie", as legend has it. Burns was once asked this question and said it would have been a funny line. Asked why he did not do it, Burns replied, "Incredibly enough, no one ever thought of it."{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In March 1953, ''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show'' joined ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' as part of the CBS Monday-night [[primetime]] lineup. As a result, the show entered the top 30 television programs in the [[Nielsen ratings]] ranking at number 20. For the 1954–1955 season, it ranked number 26, and for both the 1955–56 and 1956–57 seasons it was number 28.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

With ''I Love Lucy'' ending its six-year run on CBS in the spring of 1957, the television network wanted to renew the Burns and Allen series, but by this time, Allen had grown tired of performing. Nevertheless, Burns committed both of them for another year, which would be their eighth—and last—on television.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|274}}

Allen announced her retirement on February 17, 1958, to be effective at the end of the current season.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"&gt;[[George Burns|Burns, George]], ''Gracie: A Love Story''. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1988. {{ISBN|0399133844}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|275}}

[[File:Gbgallen.jpg|right|thumb|300px|"It really was her last scene, the last time she appeared on a stage", Burns wrote of the episode filmed June 4, 1958.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|279}}]]

Burns and Allen filmed their last show on June 4, 1958.&lt;ref name="LAT GB obit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-03-10/news/mn-45422_1_george-burns |title=George Burns, Comedy's Elder Statesman, Dies |publisher=Oliver, Myrna, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 10, 1996 |accessdate=2014-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|3}} The filming was an emotional experience, although nothing was said about it being Allen's last performance. At the wrap party, Allen took a token sip of champagne from a paper cup, hugged her friend and co-star Bea Benaderet, and said "Okay, that's it." After a brief last look around the set, she said, "And thank you very much, everyone."&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|279–280}}

"She deserved a rest," Burns said when Allen devoted herself to gardening and being a housewife:&lt;blockquote&gt;She had been working all her life, and her lines were the toughest in the world to do. They didn't make sense, so she had to memorize every word. It took a real actress. Every spare moment—in bed, under the hair dryer—had to be spent in learning lines. Do you wonder that she's happy to be rid of it?&lt;ref name="NYT GA obit"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Burns attempted to continue the show with the same supporting cast but without Allen. ''[[The George Burns Show]]'' lasted one season (October 21, 1958&amp;nbsp;– April 14, 1959) on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name="Brooks"/&gt;{{Rp|281}}

Following a mild heart attack in the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|21}} Allen suffered a series of angina episodes over a number of years.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|284, 307}} She had a major heart attack in 1961.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|289, 310}} She lived a slower but comfortable retirement for another three years, often appearing in public with her husband, but never performing. Gracie Allen died August 27, 1964,&lt;ref name="NYT GA obit"/&gt; as Burns was underway with his short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom, ''[[Wendy and Me]]'', with [[Connie Stevens]] and a cast including [[Ron Harper (actor)|Ron Harper]], [[James T. Callahan]], and [[J. Pat O'Malley]]. All the TV shows were produced under the banner of McCadden Productions, a company run by George Burns which he named after the street on which his brother William lived.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|293}} McCadden also produced the iconic TV show, ''[[Mister Ed]]''.&lt;ref name="Gracie Love Story"/&gt;{{Rp|294}} The McCadden catalog is owned by [[Sony Pictures Television]].

'''''The Immaculate Conception''''' is a [[painting]] by Italian painter [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] (1696{{ndash}}1770). It represented the [[Immaculate Conception]], an idea taught by the [[Catholic Church]] stating that the [[Virgin Mary]] was conceived without [[original sin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=BBC |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/immaculateconception.shtml |title=Immaculate Conception}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was commissioned in 1767, at a time when the Immaculate Conception concept was already common in art despite still being developed by theologians.&lt;ref name="MetMusArt"/&gt; It was declared a [[dogma]] of the Catholic Church in 1854 by [[Pope Pius IX]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p122a3p2.htm|title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - "Conceived by the power of the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary"|website=www.vatican.va}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the associated [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]] celebrated on 8 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/christianity/beliefs/immaculateconception.shtml |title=Christianity: Immaculate Conception |publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was one of seven altarpieces commissioned in March 1767 from Tiepolo by King [[Charles III of Spain]] for the [[Convent of San Pascual|Church of Saint Pascual]] in Aranjuez, then under construction. This was originally an [[Peter of Alcantara|Alcantarine]] ([[Franciscan]]) monastery that was later assigned to the [[Conceptionists|Conceptionist]] nuns. It depicts the [[Virgin Mary]],  surrounded by [[angel]]s and crowned with the [[circle of stars]].&lt;ref name="MetMusArt"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DoHKJZ7soKMC&amp;pg=PA246 |p=246 |title=Giambattista Tiepolo, 1696-1770 |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1996 |isbn=9780870998126 |editor=Keith Christiansen}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is shown trampling a snake, representing her victory over the [[devil]]. The lilies and the rose are references to ''[[hortus conclusus]]'' ("enclosed garden"), and symbolize Mary's love, virginity and purity.

==Background==
[[Baroque art]] was meant to evoke emotion and passion instead of the calm rationality that had been prized during the [[Renaissance]]. Tiepolo's works, many of which are on an imposing scale, are also characterized by tension, exuberance, hedonism and intricate designs.{{Failed verification|date=January 2016}} Among Tiepolo's most popular works are mythological and religious themes conveying an atmosphere of grandeur and beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/tiep/hd_tiep.htm|title=Giovanni Battista Tiepolo |author= Christiansen, Keith |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiepolo's altarpieces were transferred to the adjoining convent soon after they were installed in the church. They were replaced by an identically themed set by [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], whose [[neo-classicism]] was more to Charles III's taste. Finally ''The Immaculate Conception'' was transferred to the [[Prado Museum]] in 1827.&lt;ref name=Seydl/&gt;

==Painting==

The imposing Baroque style of the painting is meant to evoke emotion. It  was completed between 1767 and 1768. The depiction of the [[Madonna (art)|Virgin Mary]] is done according to traditional Christian iconography, and represents her [[Immaculate Conception]], free from original sin. Standard iconographic elements include the dove above her, the stars around her head, her position on the [[crescent]] moon with a snake crushed under her feet, her hands held together in prayer, and the obelisk on her right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www3.nd.edu/~wcawley/corson/serpent.htm|title=The Serpent and Crescent Moon at Mary's Feet|author= Corson, Dorothy|publisher=[[Notre Dame University]]|accessdate= 13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Clayton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newliturgicalmovement.org/2010/05/tiepolos-immaculate-conception.html#.VpaHsE0V-Uk|title=Tiepolo's Immaculate Conception|author= Clayton, David|publisher=New Liturgical Movement|accessdate= 13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional [[iconography]] which accords to this theme include clouds, [[cherubs]], [[Lilium|lilies]] and a pink rose, flowers which are often associated with Mary. The dove above her head symbolizes the [[Holy Ghost]], while the rose and the lilies are her customary symbols, lilies representing her purity,  while the rose is the symbol for Mary, Queen of heaven and earth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/rosarymarkings36.html Koehler, S.M., Rev.

The globe symbolizing the whole world, the crescent moon and the starry crown above her head are traditional symbols of the "woman clothed with the sun" (''Virgo in Sole'') described in [[Woman of the Apocalypse|Revelations 12:1-2]]. The crescent moon itself is an ancient symbol of chastity deriving from the Roman goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]. Just as the moon derives its light from the sun, so Mary's special grace derives from the merits of Christ, her Son. The obelisk to her right also shimmers in the light of the sun and references traditional symbols of the Immaculate Conception associated with the [[Tower of David]] and the [[Ivory Tower]], evoking impregnability, virginity and purity.&lt;ref name= Prado/&gt; Mary is depicted as trampling a serpent holding an apple in its mouth, representing the  serpent in the [[Garden of Eden]] and [[Original Sin]]. A  palm branch, and a mirror are seen under her feet. The palm branch signifies Mary's victory and exaltation, the mirror her purity.&lt;ref name= Prado/&gt;

Originating in Spain with [[Francisco Pacheco]], the popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;''Our Lady in Art'' by Katherine Lee Rawlings Jenner 2009 {{ISBN|1-103-32689-9}} pages 3-9&lt;/ref&gt; Tiepolo had painted an earlier version of the Immaculate Conception in 1734 for the Franciscan church of [[Santa Maria in Araceli (Vicenza)|Santa Maria in Araceli]] in [[Vicenza]]. That version depicted the Virgin Mary as a beautiful young girl in the manner already established by [[Guido Reni]] and [[Bartolomé Esteban Murillo]] following Pacheco. The painting is now in Vicenza's civic museum at the [[Palazzo Chiericati]].&lt;ref name= Christiansen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immaculate Conception|url=http://www.museicivicivicenza.it/en/mcp/opera.php/9680|publisher=[[Musei Civici Vicenza]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the present version the depiction of Mary is rather more majestic and solemn in keeping with the [[Peter of Alcantara|Alcantarine]] tradition of austerity.&lt;ref name= Christiansen/&gt;

Tiepolo painted a set of five ''[[modelli]]'' for his altarpieces. These are now all at the [[Courtauld Institute of Art]] in London and are considered amongst his finest work. The ''modello'' for the ''Immaculate Conception'' differs from the final version in several respects. In the final version the figure of Mary occupies more space and lacks the muscular supporting angel on her left. That angel is thought to be a representation of the [[archangel Michael]] whose slaying of [[Lucifer#Lucifer as Satan or the devil|Lucifer]] prefigured Mary's role as an instrument of [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]]. The angel is present in an oil sketch executed around the same time, now in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]], considered iconographically the most complex of Tiepolo's depictions of the Immaculate Conception. Note the triangular halo signifying the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name= Christiansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=NGI/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A complex allegorical work by Tiepolo|url=http://storyscope7test.ssl.co.uk/objectstories/2449|publisher=Storyscope}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Jurist''''' ({{lang-it|L'Avvocato}}), also known as '''''The Lawyer''''', is an [[oil painting|oil-on-canvas painting]] by Italian artist [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo]], painted in 1566.

It shows a member of the legal profession, whose facial features are depicted using meat and fish, and whose body is composed of legal documents. Two versions of the painting exist; the first, from 1566, is held by the [[Nationalmuseum|National Museum of Fine Arts]] (Nationalmuseum) in [[Stockholm]] (acquired from a collection at [[Gripsholm Castle]] in 1866), and a later version is held by a private collector in [[Milan]].

Arcimboldo was employed as court painter to [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] and was already well established as an artist by the time he created ''The Jurist''. He was known for his innovative style, particularly for his [[portrait]]s in which the subjects were composed of everyday objects. His fantastical and imaginative paintings somewhat foreshadowed the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] movement of the 20th century, but were also appreciated as part of the [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] tradition of his own time. His series of paintings, ''The Four Seasons'', which depicted the changing seasons as series of portraits composed of seasonal plants, were particularly popular, and he even created a portrait of [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]] (entitled ''Vertemnus'') in the same style.

The features of the face are represented by the plucked carcasses of poultry and the sneering mouth by fish. It is not known if the subject is a caricature of the legal profession in general or based on a real jurist of the time. The German jurist [[Ulrich Zasius]] is normally suggested as the subject; the Nationalmuseum lists the picture in its catalogue as ''The Lawyer (Ulrich Zasius)'', but [[John Calvin|Calvin]] has also been suggested. Arcimboldo's portrait of ''The Librarian'' (''Il Bibliotecario''), painted the same year, has a more noble aspect, although this portrait too has been interpreted as a parody of librarianship, book collectors, and intellectualism.

[[Image:Galileo Galilei, Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche Intorno a Due Nuove Scienze, 1638 (1400x1400).png|thumb|[[Galileo Galilei]]: ''Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche Intorno a Due Nuove Scienze'' (1638)]]
The '''''Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences''''' ({{lang-it|Discorsi e Dimostrazioni Matematiche Intorno a Due Nuove Scienze}}, {{IPA-it|diˈskorsi e dimostratˈtsjoːni mateˈmaːtike inˈtorno a ˈduːe ˈnwɔːve ˈʃɛntse|pron}}), published in 1638 was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo's]] final book and a scientific testament covering much of his work in [[physics]] over the preceding thirty years.

After his ''[[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems]]'', the [[Roman Inquisition]] had banned the publication of any of Galileo's works, including any he might write in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{anchor|_note-publication-ban}}{{Harv|Drake|1978|p=367}} See [[Galileo affair#note-publication-ban|Galileo affair]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; After the failure of his initial attempts to publish ''Two New Sciences'' in [[France]], [[Germany]], and [[Poland]], it was published by [[Lodewijk Elzevir]] who was working in [[Leiden]], [[South Holland]], where the writ of the Inquisition was of less consequence (see [[House of Elzevir]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The foundation of mechanics|url=https://archive.org/stream/independen79v80newy#page/n38/mode/1up|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=Jul 6, 1914|accessdate=July 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fra Fulgenzio Micanzio, the official theologian of the Republic of Venice, had initially offered to help Galileo publish in Venice the new work, but he pointed out that publishing the ''Two New Sciences'' in Venice might cause Galileo unnecessary trouble; thus, the book was eventually published in Holland. Galileo did not seem to suffer any harm from the Inquisition for publishing this book since in January 1639, the book reached Rome's bookstores, and all available copies (about fifty) were quickly sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Finocchiaro|editor1-first=Maurice A.|title=The Trial of Galileo: Essential Documents|date=2014|publisher=[[Hackett Publishing Company]]|isbn=1624661327|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Discourses'' was written in a style similar to ''Dialogues'', in which three men (Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati) discuss and debate the various questions Galileo is seeking to answer. There is a notable change in the men, however; Simplicio, in particular, is no longer quite as simple-minded, stubborn and Aristotelian as his name implies. His arguments are representative of Galileo's own early beliefs, as Sagredo represents his middle period, and Salviati proposes Galileo's newest models.

==Introduction==
The book is divided into four days, each addressing different areas of physics. Galileo dedicates ''Two New Sciences'' to Lord Count of Noailles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plotnitsky|first=Arkady|author2=Reed, David|title=Discourse, Mathematics, Demonstration, and Science in Galileo's Discourses Concerning Two New Sciences|journal=Configurations|date=1 January 2001|volume=9|issue=1|pages=37–64|doi=10.1353/con.2001.0007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Figure 1 of Galileo's Two New Sciences (First Day).jpg|thumb|Figure 1 out of Galileo's ''Two New Sciences'' in the First Day section]]
In the First Day, Galileo addressed topics that were discussed in [[Physics (Aristotle)|Aristotle's Physics]] and also the Aristotelian school [[Mechanics (Aristotle)|Mechanics]]. It also provides an introduction to the discussion of both of the new sciences. The likeness between the topics discussed, specific questions that are hypothesized, and the style and sources throughout give Galileo the backbone to his First Day. The First Day introduces the speakers in the dialogue: Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio, the same as in the [[Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems|Dialogue]]. These three people are all Galileo just at different stages of his life, Simplicio the youngest and Salviati, Galileo's closest counterpart. It also provides an introduction to the discussion of both of the new sciences. The second day addresses the question of the strength of materials.

The Third and Fourth days address the science of motion. The Third day discusses uniform and naturally accelerated motion, the issue of terminal velocity having been addressed in the First day. The Fourth day discusses [[projectile motion]].

In ''Two Sciences'' uniform motion is defined as a motion that, over ''any'' equal periods of time, covers equal distance. With the use of the quantifier ″any″, uniformity is introduced and expressed more explicitly than in previous definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Plotnitsky, Arkady; Reed, David (1 January 2001).

===Day one: Resistance of bodies to separation===
[50] '''Preliminary discussions.''' 
Sagredo (taken to be the younger Galileo) cannot understand why with machines one cannot argue from the small to the large: "I do not see that the properties of circles, triangles and...solid figures should change with their size". Salviati (speaking for Galileo) says the common opinion is wrong. Scale matters: a horse falling from a height of 3 or 4 cubits will break its bones whereas a cat falling from twice the height won't, nor will a grasshopper falling from a tower.

[56] The first example is a hemp rope which is constructed from small fibres which bind together in the same way as a rope round a windlass to produce something much stronger. Then the vacuum that prevents two highly polished plates from separating even though they slide easily gives rise to an experiment to test whether water can be expanded or whether a vacuum is caused. In fact, Sagredo had observed that a suction pump could not lift more than 18 cubits of water and Salviati observes that the weight of this is the amount of resistance to a void. The discussion turns to the strength of a copper wire and whether there are minute void spaces inside the metal or whether there is some other explanation for its strength.

[68] This leads into a discussion of infinites and the continuum and thence to the observation that the number of squares equal the number of roots. He comes eventually to the view that "if any number can be said to be infinite, it must be unity" and demonstrates a construction in which an infinite circle is approached and another to divide a line.

[85] The difference between a fine dust and a liquid leads to a discussion of light and how the concentrated power of the sun can melt metals. He deduces that light has motion and describes an (unsuccessful) attempt to measure its speed.

[106] Aristotle believed that bodies fell at a speed proportional to weight but Salviati doubts that Aristotle ever tested this. He also did not believe that motion in a void was possible, but since air is much less dense than water Salviati asserts that in a medium devoid of resistance (a vacuum) all bodies—a lock of wool or a bit of lead—would fall at the same speed. Large and small bodies fall at the same speed through air or water providing they are of the same density. Since ebony weighs a thousand times as much as air (which he had measured), it will fall only a very little more slowly than lead which weighs ten times as much. But shape also matters—even a piece of gold leaf (the heaviest of metals) floats through the air and a bladder filled with air falls much more slowly than lead.

[128] Measuring the speed of a fall is difficult because of the small time intervals involved and his first way round this used pendulums of the same length but with lead or cork weights. The period of oscillation was the same, even when the cork was swung more widely to compensate for the fact that it soon stopped.

[139] This leads to a discussion of the vibration of strings and he suggests that not only the length of the string is important for pitch but also the tension and the weight of the string.

===Day two: Cause of cohesion===
[151] Salviati proves that a balance can not only be used with equal arms but with unequal arms with weights inversely proportional to the distances from the fulcrum. Following this he shows that the moment of a weight suspended by a beam supported at one end is proportional to the square of the length. The resistance to fracture of beams of various sizes and thicknesses is demonstrated, supported at one or both ends.

[169] He shows that animal bones have to be proportionately larger for larger animals and the length of a cylinder that will break under its own weight. He proves that the best place to break a stick placed upon the knee is the middle and shows how far along a beam that a larger weight can be placed without breaking it.

[178] He proves that the optimum shape for a beam supported at one end and bearing a load at the other is parabolic. He also shows that hollow cylinders are stronger than solid ones of the same weight.

===Day three: Naturally accelerated motion===
[191] He first defines uniform (steady) motion and shows the relationship between speed, time and distance. He then defines uniformly accelerated motion where the speed increases by the same amount in increments of time. [[Falling bodies]] start very slowly and he sets out to show that their velocity increases in simple proportionality to time, not to distance which he shows is impossible.

[208] He shows that the distance travelled in naturally accelerated motion is proportional to the square of the time. He describes an experiment in which a steel ball was rolled down a groove in a piece of wooden moulding 12 cubits long (about 5.5m) with one end raised by one or two cubits. This was repeated, measuring times by accurately weighing the amount of water that came out of a thin pipe in a jet from the bottom of a large jug of water. By this means he was able to verify the uniformly accelerated motion. He then shows that whatever the inclination of the plane, the square of the time taken to fall a given vertical height is proportional to the inclined distance.

[221] He next considers descent along the chords of a circle, showing that the time is the same as that falling from the vertex, and various other combinations of planes. He gives an erroneous solution to the [[brachistochrone curve|brachistochrone problem]], claiming to prove that the arc of the circle is the fastest descent. 16 problems with solutions are given.

===Day four: The motion of projectiles===
[[File:Figure 126 of Galileo's Two New Sciences out of the Fourth Day section.jpg|thumb|Figure 126 of Galileo's ''Two New Sciences'' out of the Fourth Day section]]
[268] The motion of projectiles consists of a combination of uniform horizontal motion and a naturally accelerated vertical motion which produces a [[Parabola|parabolic]] curve. Two motions at right angles can be calculated using the sum of the squares. He shows in detail how to construct the parabolas in various situations and gives tables for altitude and range depending on the projected angle.

[274] Air resistance shows itself in two ways: by affecting less dense bodies more and by offering greater resistance to faster bodies. A lead ball will fall slightly faster than an oak ball, but the difference with a stone ball is negligible. However the speed does not go on increasing indefinitely but reaches a maximum. Though at small speeds the effect of air resistance is small, it is greater when considering, say, a ball fired from a cannon.

[292] The effect of a projectile hitting a target is reduced if the target is free to move. The velocity of a moving body can overcome that of a larger body if its speed is proportionately greater than the resistance.

[310] A cord or chain stretched out is never level but also approximates to a parabola. (But see also [[catenary]].)

==Methodology==
Many contemporary scientists, such as [[Pierre Gassendi|Gassendi]], dispute Galileo’s methodology for conceptualizing his law of falling bodies. Two of the main arguments are that his epistemology followed the example of Platonist thought or hypothetico-deductivist. It has now been considered to be ''ex suppositione'', or knowing the how and why effects from past events in order to determine the requirements for the production of similar effects in the future. Galileo methodology mirrored that of Aristotelian and Archimedean epistemology. Following a letter from [[Cardinal Bellarmine]] in 1615 Galileo distinguished his arguments and [[Copernicus]]' as natural suppositions as opposed to the “fictive” that are “introduced only for the sake of astronomical computations,” such as [[Plato]]'s hypothesis on eccentrics and equants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Jones|title=Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences|journal=PSA:Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|volume=1974|pages=90|jstor=495799|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1449-6_4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo’s earlier writing considered Juvenilia, or youthful writings, are considered his first attempts at creating lecture notes for his course “hypothesis of the celestial motions” while teaching in at the [[University of Padua]]. These notes mirrored those of his contemporaries at the Collegio as well as contained an “Aristotelian context with decided Thomistic ([[St. Thomas Aquinas]]) overtones.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallace|first=Jones|title=Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences|journal=PSA:Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association|volume=1974|pages=86|jstor=495799|doi=10.1007/978-94-010-1449-6_4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These earlier papers are believed to have encouraged him to apply demonstrative proof in order to give validity to his discoveries on motion.

Discovery of folio 116v gives evidence of experiments that had previously not been reported and therefore demonstrated Galileo’s actual calculations for the Law of Falling Bodies.

His methods of experimentation have been proved by the recording and recreation done by scientists such as James MacLachlan, Stillman Drake, R.H. Taylor and others in order to prove he did not merely imagine his ideas as historian [[Alexandre Koyré]] argued, but sought to prove them mathematically.

Galileo believed that knowledge could be acquired through reason, and reinforced through observation and experimentation. Thus, it can be argued that Galileo was a rationalist, and also that he was an empiricist.

==The two new sciences==
The two sciences mentioned in the title are the strength of materials and the motion of objects (the forbearers of modern [[materials science|material engineering]] and [[kinematics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tucker McElroy, ''A to Z of Mathematicians'', Facts on File (Infobase Publishing), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In the title of the book "mechanics" and "motion" are separate, since at Galileo's time "mechanics" meant only [[statics]] and strength of materials.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Gindikin]], ''Tales of Physicists and Mathematicians'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Galileo had started an additional section on the force of percussion, but was not able to complete it to his own satisfaction.

===The science of materials===
The discussion begins with a demonstration of the reasons that a large structure proportioned in exactly the same way as a smaller one must necessarily be weaker known as the [[square–cube law]]. Later in the discussion this principle is applied to the thickness required of the bones of a large animal, possibly the first quantitative result in [[biology]], anticipating [[J. B. S. Haldane]]'s work ''On Being the Right Size, and other essays,'' edited by [[John Maynard Smith]].

===The motion of objects===
Galileo expresses clearly for the first time the constant acceleration of a falling body which he was able to measure accurately by slowing it down using an inclined plane.

In ''Two New Sciences'', Galileo (Salviati speaks for him) used a wood [[Molding (decorative)|molding]], "12 cubits long, half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick" as a [[Inclined plane|ramp]] with a straight, smooth, polished [[Groove (engineering)|groove]] to study rolling balls ("a hard, smooth and very round bronze ball"). He lined the groove with "[[parchment]], also smooth and polished as possible". He inclined the ramp at various angles, effectively slowing down the acceleration enough so that he could measure the elapsed time. He would let the ball roll a known distance down the ramp, and use a [[water clock]] to measure the time taken to move the known distance. This clock was
&lt;blockquote&gt;a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length. The water collected was weighed, and after each descent on a very accurate balance, the differences and ratios of these weights gave him the differences and ratios of the times. This was done with such accuracy that although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no appreciable discrepancy in the results.&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo]] 1638 ''Discorsi e dimostrazioni matematiche, intorno à due nuove scienze'' '''213''', Leida, Appresso gli Elsevirii ([[Leiden]]: [[House of Elzevir|Louis Elsevier]]), or ''Mathematical discourses and demonstrations, relating to Two New Sciences'', English translation by Henry Crew and Alfonso de Salvio 1914. Section '''213''' is reprinted on pages 534-535 of ''On the Shoulders of Giants: The Great Works of Physics and Astronomy'' (works by [[Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]], [[Galileo]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]). [[Stephen Hawking]], ed. 2002 {{ISBN|0-7624-1348-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The law of falling bodies====
While Aristotle had observed that heavier objects fall more quickly than lighter ones, in ''Two New Sciences'' Galileo postulated that this was due ''not'' to inherently stronger forces acting on the heavier objects, but to the countervailing forces of air resistance and friction. To compensate, he conducted experiments using a shallowly inclined ramp, smoothed so as to eliminate as much friction as possible, on which he rolled down balls of different weights. In this manner, he was able to provide empirical evidence that matter accelerates vertically downward at a constant rate, regardless of mass, due to the effects of gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William. "Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences." (92).&lt;/ref&gt;

The unreported experiment found in folio 116V tested the constant rate of acceleration in falling bodies due to gravity.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, William. "Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences." (96).&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment consisted of dropping a ball from specified heights onto a deflector in order to transfer its motion from vertical to horizontal. The data from the inclined plane experiments were used to calculate the expected horizontal motion. However, discrepancies were found in the results of the experiment: the observed horizontal distances disagreed with the calculated distances expected for a constant rate of acceleration. Galileo attributed the discrepancies to air resistance in the unreported experiment, and friction in the inclined plane experiment. These discrepancies forced Galileo to assert that the postulate held only under "ideal conditions," i.e., in the absence of friction and/or air resistance.

====Bodies in motion====
Aristotelian physics argued that the Earth must not move as humans are unable to perceive the effects of this motion.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Jones. "Gassendi's Defence of Galileo: The Politics of Discretion." (224)&lt;/ref&gt; A popular justification of this is the experiment of an archer shooting an arrow straight up into the air. If the Earth were moving, Aristotle argued, the arrow should fall in a different location than the launch point. Galileo refuted this argument in ''Two New Sciences''. He provided the example of sailors aboard a boat at sea. The boat is obviously in motion, but the sailors are unable to perceive this motion. If a sailor were to drop a weighted object from the mast, this object would fall at the base of the mast rather than behind it (due to the ship's forward motion). This was the result of simultaneously the horizontal and vertical motion of the ship, sailors, and ball.

====Relativity of motions====
[[File:Galileo-1638-173.jpg|thumb|100px|Picture in Galileo's ''Discorsi'' (1638) illustrating relativity of motions]]
One of Galileo’s experiments regarding falling bodies was that describing the relativity of motions, explaining that, under the right circumstances, “one motion may be superimposed upon another without effect upon either…”. In ''Two New Sciences'', Galileo made his case for this argument and it would become the basis of [[Newton's first law]], the law of inertia.

He poses the question of what happens to a ball dropped from the mast of a sailing ship or an arrow fired into the air on the deck. According to [[Aristotle]]'s physics, the ball dropped should land at the stern of the ship as it falls straight down from the point of origin. Likewise the arrow when fired straight up should not land in the same spot if the ship is in motion. Galileo offers that there are two independent motions at play. One is the accelerating vertical motion caused by gravity while the other is the uniform horizontal motion caused by the moving ship which continues to influence the trajectory of the ball through the principle of inertia. The combination of these two motions results in a parabolic curve. The observer cannot identify this parabolic curve because the ball and observer share the horizontal movement imparted to them by the ship, meaning only the perpendicular, vertical motion is perceivable. Surprisingly, nobody had tested this theory with the simple experiments needed to gain a conclusive result until [[Pierre Gassendi]] published the results of said experiments in his letters entitled ''De Motu Impresso a Motore Translato'' (1642).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Howard|first=Jones|title=Gassendi's defense of Galileo: The Politics of Discretion|year=1988|publisher=Medieval and Renaissance Texts and Studies|location=Binghamton, N.Y.|pages=221–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infinity==
{{main article|Galileo's paradox}}

The book also contains a discussion of [[infinity]]. Galileo considers the example of numbers and [[square number|their squares]]. He starts by noting that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It cannot be denied that there are as many [squares] as there are numbers because every number is a [square] root of some square:

1 &amp;harr; 1, 2 &amp;harr; 4, 3 &amp;harr; 9, 4 &amp;harr; 16, and so on. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

(In modern language, there is a [[bijection]] between the elements of the set of positive integers N and the set of squares S, and S is a proper subset of [[Natural density|density zero]].) But he notes what appears to be a contradiction: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yet at the outset we said there are many more numbers than squares, since the larger portion of them are not squares. Not only so, but the proportionate number of squares diminishes as we pass to larger numbers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He resolves the contradiction by denying the possibility of comparing infinite numbers (and of comparing infinite and finite numbers): 
&lt;blockquote&gt;We can only infer that the totality of all numbers is infinite, that the number of squares is infinite, and that the number of their roots is infinite; neither is the number of squares less than the totality of all numbers, nor the latter greater than the former; and finally the attributes "equal," greater," and "less," are not applicable to infinite, but only to finite, quantities.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This conclusion, that ascribing sizes to infinite sets should be ruled impossible, owing to the contradictory results obtained from these two ostensibly natural ways of attempting to do so, is a resolution to the problem that is consistent with, but less powerful than, the methods used in modern mathematics. The resolution to the problem may be generalized by considering Galileo's first definition of what it means for sets to have equal sizes, that is, the ability to put them in one-to-one correspondence. This turns out to yield a way of comparing the sizes of infinite sets that is free from contradictory results.

These issues of infinity arise from problems of rolling circles. If two concentric circles of different radii roll along lines, then if the larger does not slip it appears clear that the smaller must slip. But in what way? Galileo attempts to clarify the matter by considering hexagons and then extending to rolling 100 000-gons, or n-gons, where he shows that a finite number of finite slips occur on the inner shape. Eventually, he concludes "the line traversed by the larger circle consists then of an infinite number of points which completely fill it; while that which is traced by the smaller circle consists of an infinite number of points which leave empty spaces and only partly fill the line," which would not be considered satisfactory now.

==Reactions by commentators==
::"So great a contribution to physics was ''Two New Sciences'' that scholars have long maintained that the book anticipated [[Isaac Newton's laws of motion]]." --[[Stephen Hawking]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]], ed. p. 397, ''On the Shoulders of Giants''.&lt;/ref&gt;

::"Galileo ... is the father of modern [[physics]]—indeed of modern [[science]]"—[[Albert Einstein]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Hawking]], ed. p. 398, ''On the Shoulders of Giants''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of ''Two New Sciences'' was pure mathematics, as has been pointed out by the mathematician [[Alfréd Rényi]], who argued that it was the most significant book on mathematics in over 2000 years: Greek mathematics did not deal with motion, and so they never formulated mathematical laws of motion, even though Archimedes developed differentiation and integration. ''Two New Sciences'' opened the way to treating physics mathematically by treating motion mathematically for the first time. The Greek mathematician [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] had designed his paradoxes to prove that motion could not be treated mathematically, and that any attempt to do so would lead to paradoxes. (He regarded this as an inevitable limitation of mathematics.) Aristotle reinforced this belief, saying that mathematic could only deal with abstract objects that were immutable. Galileo used the very methods of the Greeks to show that motion could indeed be treated mathematically. His idea was to separate out the paradoxes of the infinite from Zeno's paradoxes. He did this in several steps. First, he showed that the infinite sequence S of the squares 1, 4, 9, 16, ...contained as many elements as the sequence N of all positive integers. See the [[Two New Sciences#Infinity|Infinity]] section.This is now referred to as [[Galileo's paradox]]. Then, using Greek style geometry, he showed a short line interval contained as many points as a longer interval. At some point he formulates the general principle that a smaller infinite set can have just as many points as a larger infinite set containing it. It was then clear that Zeno's paradoxes on motion resulted entirely from this paradoxical behavior of infinite quantities. Having removed this 2000-year-old stumbling block, Galileo went on to introduce his mathematical laws of motion, anticipating Newton.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Renyi, ''Dialogs on Mathematics'', Holden-Day, San Francisco, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gassendi's thoughts===
[[Pierre Gassendi]] defended Galileo's opinions in his book, ''De Motu Impresso a Motore Translato''. In Howard Jones' article, ''Gassendi's Defence of Galileo: The Politics of Discretion'', Jones says Gassendi displayed an understanding of Galileo's arguments and a clear grasp of their implications for the physical objections to the earth's motion.

===Koyré's thoughts===
The [[law of falling bodies]] was published by Galileo in 1638. But in the 20th century some authorities challenged the reality of Galileo's experiments. In particular, the French [[History of science and technology|historian of science]] [[Alexandre Koyré]] bases his doubt on the fact that the experiments reported in ''Two New Sciences'' to determine the law of acceleration of falling bodies, required accurate measurements of time which appeared to be impossible with the technology of 1600. According to Koyré, the law was created deductively, and the experiments were merely illustrative [[thought experiment]]s. In fact, Galileo's water clock (described above) provided sufficiently accurate measurements of time to confirm his conjectures.

Later research, however, has validated the experiments. The experiments on falling bodies (actually rolling balls) were replicated using the methods described by Galileo,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|title=An experiment in the history of science|first=Thomas B.|last=Settle|year=1961|journal=Science|volume=133|issue=3445|pages=19–23|doi=10.1126/science.133.3445.19|pmid=17759858|bibcode=1961Sci...133...19S }}
&lt;/ref&gt; and the precision of the results was consistent with Galileo's report. Later research into Galileo's unpublished working papers from 1604 clearly showed the reality of the experiments and even indicated the particular results that led to the time-squared law.&lt;ref&gt;

==History==

===International Fund for Monuments (1965-1984)===

The ''International Fund for Monuments'' (IFM) was an organization created by Colonel James A. Gray (1909-1994) after his retirement from the [[U.S. Army]] in 1960. Gray had conceived of a visionary project to arrest the settlement of the [[Leaning Tower of Pisa]] by freezing the soil underneath, and formed the organization in 1965 as a vehicle for the implementation of this idea. Even though this project did not materialize, an opportunity arose for the young organization to participate in the conservation of the [[Rock cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches of [[Lalibela]] in [[Ethiopia]]. In 1966 Gray secured the support of philanthropist [[Lila Acheson Wallace]] (1889-1984), who offered $150,000 to the ''International Fund for Monuments'' and [[UNESCO]] for this project. The project continued until the Communist overthrow of [[Haile Selassie I]] and the subsequent expulsion of foreigners from Ethiopia. After Ethiopia, Gray's interests shifted to [[Easter Island|Easter Island (Rapa Nui)]] in [[Chile]]. Gray formed the ''Easter Island Committee'', with Norwegian ethnographer and adventurer [[Thor Heyerdahl]] (1914–2002) as its honorary chairman. Gray arranged to have one of the monolithic human figures known as ''[[moai]]'' exhibited in the United States. With the help of anthropologist [[William Mulloy]] (1917-1978), Gray selected an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=mid|-tall}}, five-ton head, which was exhibited in front of the [[Seagram Building]] in New York and in the Pan American Union building in Washington, D.C.

An important chapter for the organization started with its involvement in the broad international effort led by [[UNESCO]] for the protection of the city of [[Venice]], [[Italy]] from catastrophic flooding. After the extremely high tide of 4 November 1966, the city, including the historic [[Piazza San Marco]], was inundated for more than twenty-four hours. The ''International Fund for Monuments'' set up a ''Venice Committee'', with Professor John McAndrew (1904-1978) of [[Wellesley College]] as chairman and Gray as executive secretary. On the part of the Committee, appeals were made to the American public, and local chapters set up in American cities. This early initiative led to the formation of the independent organization Save Venice in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.savevenice.org/about/history-mission History &amp; Mission: History]". Save Venice. savevenice.org. Retrieved 21 November 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts helped establish a reputation for IFM. In [[Spain]], the organization formed a ''Committee for Spain'' under the leadership of American diplomat and [[United States Ambassador to Spain|U.S. Ambassador to Spain]] in 1965-67 [[Angier Biddle Duke]] (1915-1995).

At the invitation of UNESCO in the 1970s IFM became involved in architectural conservation in [[Nepal]], where the organization adopted the Mahadev temple complex in [[Gokarna, Nepal|Gokarna]], in Nepal's [[Kathmandu Valley]]. The 14th-century temple building was surveyed, rotten timbers were replaced, and the foundations were strengthened. Sculpted wooden architectural elements were painstakingly cleaned of layers of a [[motor oil]] coating that had been applied annually for protection.

The site was the keystone of a defensive system constructed in the early period of Haitian independence to protect the young state from French attempts to reclaim it as a  colony. Local artisans reconstructed wooden and tile roofs over the grand gallery and batteries using traditional carpentry methods, and consolidated the stone galleries of the fortress. IFM also sponsored a traveling exhibition and a film about the history of the ''Citadelle'', which was used for educational purposes in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/wmf_publication/World%20Monuments%20Fund_The%20First%20Thirty%20Years.pdf World Monuments Fund. 1996.

Through donations and matching funds, WMF has worked with local community and government partners worldwide to safeguard and conserve places of historic value for future generations. To date, WMF has worked at more than 500 sites in 91 countries, including many [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Sites]]. WMF has worked at internationally famous tourist attractions as well as lesser-known sites. Highly prominent projects are many temples at [[Angkor]], [[Cambodia]], starting in 1990, including [[Preah Khan]] and [[Phnom Bakheng]]; the [[Château de Chantilly]] in Chantilly, France; the ghost town of [[Craco]], Italy; many structures in [[Rome]], including the [[Temple of Hercules]], [[Santa Maria Antiqua]], and the [[House of Augustus]]; several sites on [[Easter Island]]; various sites at ancient [[Luxor]] in Egypt; [[Lalibela]] in Ethiopia; [[San Ignacio Miní]] in Argentina; the ancient Maya city of [[Naranjo, Guatemala]]; the [[Segovia Aqueduct]] in Segovia, Spain; as well as 25 projects in [[Venice]], Italy, over 20 years. WMF has also participated in projects in the United States, including [[Ellis Island]], [[Taos Pueblo]], [[Mesa Verde National Park]], the [[Mount Lebanon Shaker Society]], and many sites in [[New Orleans]] and the [[Gulf Coast]].

===World Monuments Watch===

Every two years WMF publishes the ''World Monuments Watch'' (formerly the ''World Monuments Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites''). Since the first list was compiled in 1996, this program has drawn international attention to cultural heritage sites around the world threatened by neglect, vandalism, armed conflict, commercial development, natural disasters, and climate change. Through the ''World Monuments Watch'', WMF fosters community support for the protection of endangered sites, and attracts technical and financial support for the sites.

The sites are nominated by international and local preservation groups and professionals, including local authorities. Sites of all types, including secular and religious architecture, archaeological sites, landscapes and townscapes, and dating from all time periods, from ancient to contemporary, are eligible. An independent panel of international experts reviews and selects the sites that make up the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf Press Release: World Monuments Watch List ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521092007/http://www.wmf.org/pdf/Watch_2008_release.pdf |date=21 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the panelists were [[Christina Cameron]], Alfredo Conti, Pierre-André Lablaude, Jeanne Marie Teutonico, and Christopher Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/downloads/2010_Watch_Panelists_Bios.pdf |title=2010 World Monuments Watch Panelist Bios |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special Initiatives===

WMF also operates a number of special initiatives that transcend individual projects at specific sites and address broader themes in heritage preservation.

[[File:WMF Future of Babylon.ogv|thumb|This video details WMF's site management plan for Babylon, a blueprint for working on the site today as well as planning for the future.]]

====Iraq's Cultural Heritage====
Following the [[Iraq War]] WMF created the ''Iraq Cultural Heritage Conservation Initiative'' to address the many threats to Iraq’s cultural heritage resulting from the occupation and from a long period of political isolation and conflict. At the ancient city of [[Babylon]] WMF has launched a program with the support of the [[United States Department of State]] to develop a comprehensive site management plan, help local officials prepare a nomination for [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] listing, and establish site boundaries for the long-term protection of the ancient city.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/science/23babylon.html John Noble Wilford. "After Years of War and Abuse, New Hope for Ancient Babylon." ''New York Times'', March 22, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modernism at Risk====

Through this initiative, the biennial ''World Monuments Fund / Knoll Modernism Prize'' was established in 2008. The inaugural prize was awarded to Brenne Gesellschaft von Architekten mbH for the restoration of the former [[ADGB Trade Union School]], an important [[Bauhaus]] structure in [[Bernau bei Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The 2010 prize was awarded to Bierman Henket Architecten and Wessel de Jonge Architecten for the restoration of the [[Zonnestraal (estate)|Zonnestraal Sanatorium]], an aftercare colony for tubercular patients near [[Hilversum]], in the [[Netherlands]], built in 1931. The 2012 prize was awarded to the Architectural Consortium for Hizuchi Elementary School for the restoration of Hizuchi Elementary School in Hizuchi, Yawatahama City, Ehime Prefecture, Japan.
