The '''Amerind Foundation''' is a [[museum]] and research facility dedicated to the preservation and interpretation of [[Amerindian|Native American]] cultures and their histories. Its facilities are located near the village of [[Dragoon, Arizona|Dragoon]] in [[Cochise County, Arizona]], about 65 miles east of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] in [[Texas Canyon]].

[[William Shirley Fulton]] (1880–1964), an archaeologist, established the Amerind Foundation in 1937.

The Amerind Foundation's building was designed by Tucson architect [[Merritt Starkweather]] and contains one of the finest collections of [[archaeology|archaeological]] and [[ethnology|ethnological]] artifacts in the country as well as a sizable research library. 

According to the Foundation's literature, "Amerind" is a contraction of the words "[[Native American name controversy|American]]" and "Indian".

==Museum exhibits==
The museum's permanent exhibits include archaeological artifacts from the Amerind property by founder [[William Shirley Fulton]] and later by director [[Charles C. Di Peso]], as well as items found at Di Peso at [[Casas Grandes, Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]] and other excavations.  The objects include weapons, tools, baskets, sandals, cordage of human hair, and cloth.

There are ethnographic items from different indigenous peoples ranging from Alaska to South America. Items on display include jewelry, baskets, weapons, cradle boards, religious artifacts, figurative items, ceramics and pottery, and art.

===Art Gallery===
The Fulton-Hayden Memorial Art Gallery features paintings by 20th century [[Anglo]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] artists.

'''{{lang|la|Anno Mundi}}''' ([[Latin]] for "in the year of the world"; [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]:&amp;nbsp;{{hebrew|לבריאת העולם}}, "to the creation of the world"), abbreviated as '''AM''', or '''Year After Creation''',&lt;ref name=YearAfterCreationChronology /&gt; is a [[calendar era]] based on the [[Bible|biblical]] accounts of the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the world and subsequent history. Two such calendar eras have seen notable use historically:
*The [[Byzantine calendar]] was used  in the [[Byzantine Empire]] and many Christian Orthodox countries and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]es and was based on the [[Septuagint]] text of the Bible. That calendar is similar to the [[Julian calendar]] except that its [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] is equivalent to 1 September 5509 BC on the [[Julian proleptic calendar]].
*Since the Middle Ages, the [[Hebrew calendar]] has been based on rabbinic calculations of the year of creation from the Hebrew [[Masoretic text]] of the bible. This calendar is used within Jewish communities for religious and other purposes. On the Hebrew calendar, the day begins at sunset. The calendar's epoch, corresponding to the calculated date of the world's creation, is equivalent to sunset on the Julian proleptic calendar date 6 October 3761 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Dershowitz |first1=Nachum |author1-link=Nachum Dershowitz|last2=Reingold |first2=Edward M. |author2-link=Edward M. Reingold|title=Calendrical Calculations |edition=1st |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |ISBN=0-521-56474-3 |page=11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new year begins at [[Rosh Hashanah]], roughly in September. Year ''anno mundi'' {{#time:xjY}}, or AM {{#time:xjY}}, began at sunset on {{#time:j F Y|@{{Hebrew year/rhdatum}}-1 day}} on the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hebcal.com/converter/?gd=13&amp;gm=9&amp;gy=2015&amp;gs=on&amp;g2h=1&lt;/ref&gt;

While differences in biblical interpretation or in calculation methodology can produce some differences in the creation date, most results fall relatively close to one of these two dominant models. The primary reason for the disparity seems to lie in which underlying Biblical text is chosen (roughly 5500 BC based on the Greek Septuagint text, about 3750 BC based on the Hebrew Masoretic text). Most of the 1,732-year difference resides in numerical discrepancies in the genealogies of the two versions of the [[Book of Genesis]]. Patriarchs from Adam to [[Terah]], the father of [[Abraham]], are said to be older by as much as 100 years or more when they begat their named son in the Greek Septuagint&lt;ref name=LXX5&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint GENESIS – 5|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/5.asp|work=The Greek Old Testament (Septuagint)|publisher=Elpenor|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LXX11&gt;{{cite web|title=Septuagint GENESIS – 11|url=http://www.ellopos.net/elpenor/physis/septuagint-genesis/11.asp|work=The Greek Old Testament (Septuagint)|publisher=Elpenor|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; than they were in the Latin [[Vulgate]] ({{bibleref|Genesis|5|4}}; {{bibleref|Genesis|11|4}}) or the Hebrew [[Tanakh]] ({{bibleref|Gen|5|JPR}}; {{bibleref|Gen|11|JPR}}). The net difference between the two major [[genealogies of Genesis]] is 1466 years (ignoring the "second year after the flood" ambiguity), 85% of the total difference. (See [[Dating creation]].)

==Jewish tradition==
{{see| Hebrew calendar}}
During the Talmudic era, from the 1st to the 10th centuries AD, the center of the Jewish world was in the Middle East, primarily in the [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudic Academies of Babylonia]] and [[Talmudic Academies in the Land of Israel|Israel]]. Jews in these regions used [[Seleucid Era]] dating (also known as the "Anno Graecorum (AG)" or the "Era of Contracts") as the primary method for calculating the calendar year.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AvVPlyYjX7YC&amp;pg=PA295 Chronology of the Old Testament, Dr. Floyd Nolen Jones] "When the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe during the 8th and 9th centuries AD, calculations from the Seleucid era became meaningless. Over those centuries, it was replaced by that of the ''anno mundi'' era of the ''Seder Olam''. From the 11th century, ''anno mundi'' dating became dominant throughout most of the world's Jewish communities."&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the writings of [[Josephus]] and the [[Books of the Maccabees]] used Seleucid Era dating exclusively, and the [[Talmud]] tractate [[Avodah Zarah]] states:
{{quote|[[Rav]] [[Aha b. Jacob]] then put this question: How do we know that our Era [of Documents] is connected with the Kingdom of Greece at all? Why not say that it is reckoned from the Exodus from Egypt, omitting the first thousand years and giving the years of the next thousand? In that case, the document is really post-dated!

Said [[Rav Nachman|Rav Nahman]]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used. He [the questioner] thought that Rav Nahman wanted to dispose of him anyhow, but when he went and studied it thoroughly he found that it is indeed taught [in a [[Baraita]]]: In the Diaspora the Greek Era alone is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Atenebris Adsole |url=http://www.halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_10.html |title=Avodah Zarah, tractate 10 |publisher=Halakhah.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Occasionally in Talmudic writings, reference was made to other starting points for eras, such as Destruction Era dating,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halakhah.com/zarah/zarah_9.html Avodah Zarah, tractate 9] Footnote: "The Eras in use among Jews in Talmudic Times are: (a) ERA OF CONTRACTS [H] dating from the year 380 before the Destruction of the Second Temple (312–1 BC) when, at the Battle of Gaza, Seleucus Nicator, one of the followers of Alexander the Great, gained dominion over Palestine. It is also termed Seleucid or Greek Era [H]. Its designation as Alexandrian Era connecting it with Alexander the Great (Maim. Yad, Gerushin 1, 27) is an anachronism, since Alexander died in 323 BC — eleven years before this Era began (v. E. Mahler, Handbuch der judischen Chronologie, p. 145). This Era, which is first mentioned in Mac. I, 10, and was used by notaries or scribes for dating all civil contracts, was generally in vogue in eastern countries till the 16th cent, and was employed even in the 19th cent, among the Jews of Yemen, in South Arabia (Eben Saphir, Lyck, 1866, p. 62b). (b) THE ERA OF THE DESTRUCTION (of the Second Temple) [H] the year 1 of which corresponds to 381 of the Seleucid Era, and 69–70 of the Christian Era. This Era was mainly employed by the Rabbis and was in use in Palestine for several centuries, and even in the later Middle Ages documents were dated by it. One of the recently discovered Genizah documents bears the date 13 Tammuz 987 after the Destruction of the Temple — i.e. 917 C.E. — (Op. cit. p. 152, also Marmorstein ZDMG, Vol. VI, p. 640). The difference between the two Eras as far as the tens and units are concerned is thus 20. If therefore a Tanna, say in the year 156 Era of Dest. (225 C.E.), while remembering, naturally, the century, is uncertain about the tens and units, he should ask the notary what year it is according to his — Seleucid — era. He will get the answer 536 (156 + 380), on adding 20 to which he would get 556, the last two figures giving him the year [1] 56 of the Era of Destruction."&lt;/ref&gt; being the number of years since the AD 70 [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|destruction of the Second Temple]], and the number of years since the [[dating Creation|Creation year]] based on the calculation in the [[Seder Olam Rabbah]] of Rabbi [[Jose ben Halafta]] in about AD 160.&lt;ref&gt;p. 107, Kantor&lt;/ref&gt; By his calculation, based on the [[Masoretic Text]], [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] were created on 1st of Tishrei ([[Rosh Hashanah]] Day 1) in 3760 BC,&lt;ref name=BirthdayAdamEve&gt;{{cite web|title=Birthday of Adam &amp; Eve (3760 BC)|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day_cdo/aid/150485/jewish/Adam-Eve.htm|work=Jewish History|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Creation&gt;{{cite web|title=Creation (3761 BC)|url=http://www.chabad.org/calendar/view/day_cdo/aid/156820/jewish/Creation.htm|work=Jewish History|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JewishYear&gt;"To find the corresponding Jewish year for any year on the Gregorian calendar, add 3760 to the Gregorian number, if it is before Rosh Hashanah. After Rosh Hashanah, add 3761. " {{cite web|title=The Jewish year|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/526875/jewish/The-Jewish-Year.htm|work=About the Jewish Calendar|publisher=Chabad-Lubavitch Media Center|accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; later confirmed by the Muslim chronologist [[al-Biruni]] as 3448 years before the [[Seleucid era]].&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[The Remaining Signs of Past Centuries]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the c. 8th-century AD [[Baraita of Samuel]].

In the 8th and 9th centuries AD, the center of Jewish life moved from Babylonia to Europe, so calculations from the Seleucid era "became meaningless".&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt; From the 11th century, ''anno mundi'' dating became dominant throughout most of the world's Jewish communities, replacing the Seleucid dating system.&lt;ref name=Jones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0umDqPOf2L8C&amp;pg=PA87 |title=The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era, Alden A. Mosshammer |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new system reached its definitive form in AD 1178 when [[Maimonides]] completed the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]''. In the section ''Sanctification of the Moon'' (11.16), he wrote of his choice of Epoch, from which calculations of all dates should be made, as "the third day of Nisan in this present year ... which is the year 4938 of the creation of the world" (March 22, AD 1178).&lt;ref&gt;Solomon Gandz, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3622160 Date of Composition of Maimonides Code], ''Proceedings of the American Academy for Jewish Research'', 17 (1947–1948), pp. 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt; He included all the rules for the calculated calendar epoch and their scriptural basis, including the modern epochal year in his work, and establishing the final formal usage of the ''anno mundi'' era.

The first year of the Jewish calendar, Anno Mundi 1 (AM 1), began about one year before Creation, so that year is also called the Year of emptiness. The first five days of Jewish Creation week occupy the last five days of AM 1, Elul 25–29. The sixth day of Creation, when [[Adam]] and [[Eve]] were created, is the first day of AM 2, [[Rosh Hashanah]] (1 Tishrei). Its associated [[molad]] Adam (molad VaYaD) occurred on Day 5 (yom Vav) at 14 (Yud Daled) hours (and 0 parts). A year earlier, the first day of AM 1, Rosh Hashanah (1 Tishrei), is associated with [[molad tohu#Anno Mundi|molad tohu]] (new moon of chaos), so named because it occurred before Creation when everything was still chaotic — it is also translated as the new moon of nothing. This is also called molad BaHaRaD, because it occurred on Day 2 (yom Beis), 5 (Hei) hours, 204 (RaD) parts (11:11:20 pm). Because this is just before midnight when the Western day begins, but after 6 pm when the Jewish calendrical day begins (equivalent to the next tabular day with the same daylight period), its Julian calendar date is 6/7 October 3761 BC (Gregorian: 6/7 September 3761 BC or −3760).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://strangeside.com/calendar-when-does-it-start/ | title=Calendar — when does it start | website=strangeside.com | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tondering.dk/claus/cal/hebrew.php | title=The Hebrew Calendar | last=Tøndering | first=Claus | date=2014 | website=www.tondering.dk | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hebrewcalendar.tripod.com/luachmail.html#029 | title=Is Creation at AM 1 or AM 2? | last=Landau | first=Remy | date=February 16, 2005 | website=hebrewcalendar.tripod.com | access-date=October 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Greek tradition==
[[File:Bevis Marks Synagogue P6110036.JPG|thumb|The inscription over the [[Bevis Marks Synagogue]], [[City of London]], gives a year in Anno Mundi (5461) and [[Anno Domini]] (1701).]]
The [[Septuagint]] was the most scholarly non-Hebrew version of the [[Old Testament]] available to [[early Christian]]s. Many converts already spoke Greek, and it was readily adopted as the preferred vernacular-language rendering for the eastern Roman Empire. The later Latin translation called the [[Vulgate]], an [[Christology|interpretative]] translation from the later [[Masoretic Text]] (a Jewish revision and consolidation of earlier Hebrew texts), replaced it in the west after its completion by [[Jerome|St. Jerome]] c. 405, Latin being the most common vernacular language in those regions.

===Earliest Christian chronology===
The earliest extant Christian writings on the age of the world according to the biblical chronology were therefore based on the Septuagint, due to its early availability. They can be found in the ''Apology to Autolycus (Apologia ad Autolycum)'' by [[Theophilus of Antioch|Theophilus]] (AD 115–181), the sixth bishop of Antioch,&lt;ref name="theophilus"&gt;[[Theophilus of Antioch]]. ''Theophilus of Antioch to Autolycus.'' Book III. Chapters [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxiv.html XXIV] (Adam—Samuel), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxv.html XXV] (Saul—Cyrus), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxvii.html XXVII] (Cyrus—M. Aurelius Verus), [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf02.iv.ii.iii.xxviii.html Chap. XXVIII] (Adam—M.

Theophilus presents a detailed chronology "from the foundation of the world" to emperor Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref name="theophilus"/&gt; His chronology begins with the biblical first man [[Adam]] through to emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]], in whose reign Theophilus lived. The chronology puts the creation of the world at about 5529 BC: "All the years from the creation of the world amount to a total of 5,698 years."&lt;ref name="theophilus"/&gt; No mention of [[Jesus of Nazareth]] is made in his chronology. [[Seraphim Rose]] corrected the date to about 5530 BC, to recognise that there is no year 0 in [[Christian era]] dating.&lt;ref name="GENESIS 2000. p. 236"&gt;Fr. [[Seraphim Rose]].

Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder points out that the writings of the [[Church Fathers]] on this subject are of vital significance (''even though he disagrees with their chronological system based on the authenticity of the [[Septuagint]], as compared to that of the [[Masoretic Text|Hebrew text]]''), in that through the Christian chronographers a window to the earlier Hellenistic biblical chronographers{{refn|1=[[Eratosthenes|Eratosthenes of Cyrene ]] (275–194 BC) represented contemporary Alexandrian scholarship; [[Eupolemus]], a Palestinian Jew and a friend of [[Judas Maccabeus|Judah Maccabee]], writing in 158 BC, is said to have been the first historian who synchronized Greek history in accordance with the theory of the Mosaic origin of culture. By the time of the 1st century BC, a world chronicle had synchronized Jewish and Greek history and had gained international circulation: [[Alexander Polyhistor]] (flourishing in 85–35 BC); [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] (116–27 BC); Ptolemy priest of Mendes (50 BC), who is cited by [[Tatian]] (''Oratio ad Graecos'', 38); [[Apion]] (1st century AD); [[Thrasyllus of Mendes|Thrasyllus]] (before AD 36); and [[Thallus (historian)|Thallus]] (1st century AD) – all cited chronicles which had incorporated the dates of the [[Noachite]] flood and the exodus. (Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder. "Biblical Chronology in the Hellenistic World Chronicles". in ''The Harvard Theological Review'', Vol.61, No.3 (July 1968), pp. 451–452.)|group=note}} is preserved:

:An immense intellectual effort was expended during the [[Hellenistic period]] by both Jews and [[Paganism|pagans]] to date [[Genesis creation myth|creation]], [[Flood (mythology)#Biblical deluge|the flood]], [[The Exodus|exodus]], [[Solomon's Temple|building of the Temple]]... In the course of their studies, men such as [[Tatian|Tatian of Antioch]] (flourished in 180), [[Clement of Alexandria]] (died before 215), [[Hippolytus of Rome]] (died in 235), [[Sextus Julius Africanus]] of Jerusalem (died after 240), [[Eusebius of Caesarea]] in Palestine (260–340), and Pseudo-Justin frequently quoted their predecessors, the Graeco-Jewish biblical chronographers of the Hellenistic period, thereby allowing discernment of more distant scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Ben Zion Wacholder.

===Alexandrian era===
The [[Byzantine calendar#Alexandrian Era|Alexandrian era]], arising in AD 412, was the precursor to the [[Byzantine era]]. After the initial attempts by [[Hippolytus of Rome|Hippolytus]], [[Clement of Alexandria]] and others, the Alexandrian computation of the date of creation was worked out to be 25 March 5493 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Elias J Bickerman|title=Chronology of the Ancient World (Aspects of Greek &amp; Roman Life) |year=1980|publisher=Cornell Univ. Press|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=0-8014-1282-X|edition=2nd sub|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Alexandrian monk [[Panodorus of Alexandria|Panodoros]] reckoned 5904 years from Adam to the year AD 412. His years began with 29 August, corresponding to the [[Thout|First of Thoth]], or the [[Egyptian calendar|Egyptian]] new year.&lt;ref&gt;Rev. Philip Schaff (1819–1893), Ed. "Era." ''[[Schaff–Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge]]''. New Edition, 13 Vols., 1908–14. [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc04/Page_163.html Vol. 4, pp. 163].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annianus of Alexandria]] however, preferred the Annunciation style as New Year's Day, 25 March, and shifted the Panodoros era by about six months, to begin on 25 March. This created the ''Alexandrian era'', whose first day was the first day of the proleptic{{refn|1=A calendar obtained by extension earlier in time than its invention or implementation is called the proleptic version of the calendar.|group=note}} Alexandrian civil year in progress, 29 August 5493 BC, with the ecclesiastical year beginning on 25 March 5493 BC.

:This system presents in a masterly sort of way the mystical coincidence of the three main dates of the world's history: the beginning of Creation, the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], and the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] of [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]. All these events happened, according to the Alexandrian chronology, on the 25th of March; furthermore, the first two events were separated by the period of exactly 5500 years; the first and the third one occurred on Sunday — the sacred day of the beginning of the Creation and its renovation through Christ.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"&gt;Pavel Kuzenkov (Moscow). "[http://www.wra1th.plus.com/byzcong/comms/Kuzenkov_paper.pdf How old is the World? The Byzantine era κατα Ρωμαίους and its rivals"] ({{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715093926/http://www.wra1th.plus.com/byzcong/comms/Kuzenkov_paper.pdf |date=July 15, 2011 }}) ''21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies'', London 2006. pp. 2–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Dionysius of Alexandria|Dionysius of Alexandria]] had earlier emphatically quoted mystical justifications for the choice of 25 March as the start of the year:
:March 25 was considered to be the anniversary of Creation itself. It was the first day of the year in the medieval [[Julian calendar]] and the nominal vernal equinox (it had been the actual equinox at the time when the Julian calendar was originally designed). Considering that Christ was conceived at that date turned March 25 into the Feast of the [[Annunciation]] which had to be followed, nine months later, by the celebration of the [[Nativity of Christ|birth of Christ]], Christmas, on December 25.

The ''Alexandrian Era'' of 25 March 5493 BC was adopted by church fathers such as [[Maximus the Confessor]] and [[Theophanes the Confessor]], as well as chroniclers such as [[George Syncellus]]. Its striking mysticism made it popular in Byzantium especially in monastic circles. However this masterpiece of Christian symbolism had two serious weak points: historical inaccuracy surrounding the date of [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] as determined by its [[Easter]] [[w:Computus|computus]],{{refn|1=In the commonly used 19‐year [[Easter]] moon cycle, there was no year when the Passover (the first spring full moon, Nisan 14) would coincide with Friday and the traditional date of the Passion, 25 March; according to Alexandrian system the date would have to have been Anno Mundi 5533 = 42(!)AD.|group=note}} and its contradiction to the chronology of the [[Gospel]] of [[John the Apostle|St John]] regarding the date of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Crucifixion]] on Friday after the Passover.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"/&gt;

===Chronicon Paschale===
A new variant of the ''World Era'' was suggested in the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]'', a valuable Byzantine universal chronicle of the world, composed about the year AD 630 by some representative of the Antiochian scholarly tradition.&lt;ref name="KUZENKOV-2"/&gt; It dates the creation of [[Adam]] to 21 March 5507 BC.

For its influence on Greek Christian chronology, and also because of its wide scope, the ''"Chronicon Paschale"'' takes its place beside [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]], and the chronicle of the monk [[George Syncellus|Georgius Syncellus]]&lt;ref&gt;[[George Syncellus|George Synkellos]]. ''The Chronography of George Synkellos: a Byzantine Chronicle of Universal History from the Creation''. Transl. Prof. Dr. William Adler &amp; Paul Tuffin. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; which was so important in the Middle Ages; but in respect of form it is inferior to these works.&lt;ref&gt;Van der Essen, L. "[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03730b.htm Chronicon Paschale]". In ''The Catholic Encyclopedia (New Advent)''. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adoption of Byzantine era===
The Byzantine Anno Mundi era was the official calendar of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] from c. AD 691 to 1728 in the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]]. By the late 10th century the [[Byzantine era]], which had become fixed at 1 September 5509 BC since at least the mid-7th century (differing by 16 years from the Alexandrian date, and 2 years from the ''[[Chronicon Paschale]]''), had become the widely accepted calendar by [[Chalcedonian Christianity]]. The Byzantine era was used as the civil calendar by the [[Byzantine Empire]] from AD 988 to 1453, and by [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]] from c. AD 988 to 1700.

The computation was derived from the [[Septuagint]] version of the [[Bible]], and placed the date of creation at 5509 years before the [[Incarnation (Christianity)|Incarnation]], which was later taken to mean 5509 BC when conversions to the Christian era were desired. With a new year date of September 1, which coincides with the beginning of the Orthodox liturgical year, its epoch became 1 September 5509 BC (Julian), and year AM 1 thus lasted until 31 August 5508 BC. The "year of creation" was generally expressed in Greek in the Byzantine calendar as "Etos Kosmou", literally "year of the universe".

===Western church===
Western Christianity never fully adopted an Anno Mundi epoch system, and did not at first produce chronologies based on the Vulgate that were in contrast to the eastern calculations from the Septuagint. Since the Vulgate was not completed until only a few years before the [[Fall of the Western Roman Empire#408–410; the end of an effective regular field army, starvation in Italia, sack of Rome|sack of Rome]] by the Goths, there was little time for such developments before the political upheavals that followed in the west. Whatever the reasons, the west eventually came to rely instead on the independently developed [[Anno Domini]] (AD) epoch system. AM dating did continue to be of interest for liturgical reasons, however, since it was of direct relevance to the calculation of the [[Nativity of Jesus]] (AM 5197–5199) and the [[Passion of Christ]] (AM 5228–5231). For example, [[Bede]] in his World-Chronicle (Chapter 66 of his ''[[De Temporum Ratione]]'', On the Reckoning of Time), dated all events using an epoch he derived from the Vulgate which set the birth of Christ as AM 3952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Bertrand Westphal''' is a French scholar and essayist born on May 10, 1962 in [[Strasbourg, France]].

==Career==
Westphal, a professor of [[comparative literature]] and [[literary theory]], has been teaching at the [[University of Limoges]] since 1998. He has been directing the « Human Spaces and Cultural Interactions » research team (EA 1087) since 2000.

He was a visiting professor at [[Texas Tech University]] (2005) and at the [[University of North Carolina Charlotte]] (2013-2015).

Westphal is the founder of [[Geocriticism]], a method of literary analysis and literary theory that incorporates the study of geographic space. After editing the first collective work on this topic (''La Géocritique mode d'emploi''), he published the essay ''La Géocritique. Réel, fiction, espace'' in 2007. In 2011, the book was translated into English (United States) under the title of ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'' by [[Robert Tally]], who has become one of the main promoters of this literary approach in the United States. Geocriticism lays the foundations of the homonymous theory, i.e. an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses on spatial representations.

In 2011, Westphal published the essay ''Le Monde plausible. Espace, lieu, carte'', which proposes a diachronic study of the models of spatial representation. In this book, he distinguishes open space and closed place and gives special value to maps. In 2013, ''Le Monde plausible'' was translated into English (United States) by Amy Wells under the title ''The Plausible World''.
A third volume, ''La Cage des méridiens. La littérature et l’art contemporain face à la globalisation'', published in March 2016, completes what appears to be a Geocriticism trilogy. This work examines the specific role of literature and contemporary art on a global scale and focuses on transcultural logics and decentering.

Westphal is the author of several other books, such as ''Roman et Evangile'' (2000) about the transposition, in a plain narratological sense, of episodes or characters drawn from the Gospels in the contemporary European novel. He is also the author of ''L’œil de la Méditerranée. Une odyssée littéraire'' (2005), which brings together a series of studies of Mediterranean places, and ''Austro-fictions. Une géographie de l’intime'' (2010), which explores the works of a dozen of contemporary Austrian writers.

'''Bibliomining''' is the use of a combination of [[data mining]], [[data warehousing]], and [[bibliometrics]] for the purpose of analyzing library services. The term was created in 2003 by Scott Nicholson, Assistant Professor, Syracuse University School of Information Studies, in order to distinguish data mining in a library setting from other types of data mining.

==How bibliomining works==
First a data warehouse must be created. This is done by compiling information on the resources, such as titles and authors, subject headings, and descriptions of the collections. Then the demographic surrogate information is organized. Finally the library information (such as the librarian, whether or not the information came from the reference desk or circulation desk, and the location of the library) is obtained. 

Once this is organized, the data can be processed and analyzed. This can be done via a few methods, such as online analytical processing ([[OLAP]]), using a data mining program, or through [[data visualization]].

==Uses of bibliomining==
Bibliomining is used to discover patterns in what people are reading and researching and allows librarians to target their community better. Bibliomining can also help library directors focus their budgets on resources that will be utilized. Another use is to determine when people use the library more often, so staffing needs can be adequately met. Combining bibliomining with other research techniques such as focus groups, surveys and cost-benefit analysis, will help librarians to get a better picture of their patrons and their needs.

==Issues==

There is some concern that data mining violates patron privacy. But by extracting the data, all [[personally identifiable information]] is deleted, and the data warehouse is clean. The original patron data can then be totally deleted and there will be no way to link the new data to a particular patron.  This can be done in a few ways. One, used with information regarding database access, is to track the IP address, but then replace it with a similar code, that will allow identification without violating privacy.  Another is to keep track of an item returned to the library and create a "demographic surrogate" of the patron. The demographic surrogate would not give any identifiable information such as names, library card numbers or addresses.

The other concern in bibliomining is that it only provides data in a very detached manner. Information is given as to how a patron uses library resources, but there is no way to track if the resources met the user's needs completely. Someone could take out a book on a topic, but not find the information they were seeking. Bibliomining only helps identify which books are used, not how useful they actually were. Bibliomining cannot provide information on how well a collection serves a patron. In order to counteract this, bibliomining must be used in accordance with other research techniques.

[[Manglawar]] (or Manglor) valley in Pakistan is situated about 9 Km to North East of [[Mingora]], at the point where a number of side valleys descend from the watershed range to the east. The valley has a number of Buddhist [[Relief sculpture|reliefs]] and sculptures, the best known of which is the Shakhorai Buddha.

== The valley's archaeological importance ==

The Swat Valley contained a large number of monasteries, forming a sacred landscape where images, sculptures and inscriptions welcomed pilgrims as they entered the valley.&lt;ref name="Buddha Restored 1"&gt;(13 July, 2018). [https://tribune.com.pk/story/1756539/1-buddha-statue-restored-swat/ Buddha Statue Restored in Swat]. [[The Express Tribune]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars believe that the valley is the site of [[Oddiyana]], a small medieval kingdom that played a crucial role in the development and dissemination of [[Vajrayana Buddhism]], and the homeland of the sages [[Indrabhuti|Indrabhūti]] and [[Padmasambhava]].&lt;ref&gt;Filigenzi, Anna (2015). [https://verlag.oeaw.ac.at/art-and-landscape Buddhist Rock Sculptures of Late Antiqe Swat/Uddiyana]. Pub: VÖAW. {{ISBN|978-3-7001-7241-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As one enters the sub-valley of Manglawar its importance is immediately revealed with the huge and well known rock relief of the '''Shakhorai Buddha'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Tucci |G. Tucci]], ''Preliminary report on an archelogical survey in Swat,'' East and West, vol. 9, P:306&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of sub-valley Manglawar can be judged from the accounts of [[Aurel Stein|Sir. Aural Stein]], he says:
{{blockquote|Of all the Buddhist relieves found on the rock near Manglawar and miles up the valley the colossal image of a seated Buddha some thirteen feet in height is certainly the most striking. It is carved on the vertical face of a high reddish rock, high above the narrow terrace at its foot, and is a well-executed piece of work. This position, while it had saved the relievo from damage by pious vandals, has at the same time made it distinctly difficult to photograph. The hands of the true believers much often have itched as they saw this benign-faced heathen idol looking down towards Manglawar from its heights of some three hundred feet above Shakhorai hamlet"''”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aurel Stein|A.Stein]], ''On Alexender track to Indus'', (1972), P:77-78&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ebooks.cambridge.org/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139923538&amp;cid=CBO9781139923538A018 X - Buddhist Remains about Saidu and Manglawar]  pp. 72-80&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In [[First Battle of Swat|2007]] the Taliban tried to destroy the head of the relief with explosives, although ultimately only the top part of the Buddha’s head was damaged. The carving has since been restored by the Italian Archaeological Mission in Swat. A coating was applied to protect the damaged part of the carving in 2012, and next the face was restored in [[3D reconstruction|3D]] using laser surveys and old photographs. Finally, it was physically restored using parts of the original that had been picked up off the valley floor. The restoration was completed in October 2016, deliberately leaving some of the damage visible.&lt;ref name="Buddha Restored 1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamad Ali, Syed (January 24, 2018).

The '''C. G. Jung Institute, Zürich''' (German: '''C. G. Jung-Institut Zürich''') was founded in [[Küsnacht]], [[Switzerland]], in 1948 by the psychiatrist [[Carl Gustav Jung]], the founder of [[Analytical psychology]] (more commonly called Jungian psychology). [[Marie-Louise von Franz]] and [[Jolande Jacobi]] were also active in the foundation and early work of the institute.

The institute was founded in 1948 to provide training and conduct research in Analytical psychology and [[psychotherapy]]. Jung led the institute until 1961, the year of his death. The library of the institute holds around 15,000 books and periodicals related to [[Jungian psychology]].

Several other organizations named the C.G. Jung Institute exist around the world, e.g. in [[Los Angeles]].

'''CMAQ''' is an acronym for the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/asmdnerl/Research/RIA/cmaq.html |title=Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model &amp;#124; Research in Action &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=2010-11-17 |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.cmascenter.org/cmaq/ |title=Community Modeling and Analysis (CMAS) - CMAQ |publisher=Cmascenter.org |date=2014-10-24 |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sophisticated [[Atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion model]] developed by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|US EPA]] to address regional air pollution problems. An example of a regional air pollution problem is a multi-state area where ozone or fine particulate levels exceed the [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards|US health standards]]. In addition to simulating the emission, advection, diffusion, and deposition of air pollutants, CMAQ treats a wide array of chemical reactions that occur throughout the lower atmosphere.  For example, [[Tropospheric ozone|ozone]] forms in the atmosphere when [[nitrogen oxide]]s interact with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight.  Ammonium sulfate is formed in [[Particulates|fine particulate matter]] when sulfuric acid (formed largely in cloud water) interacts with gas-phase ammonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/amete/2014/534675/ |title=The Impact of Nonlocal Ammonia on Submicron Particulate Matter and Visibility Degradation in Urban Shanghai |publisher=Hindawi.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Meteorological conditions such as subsidence [[Inversion (meteorology)|inversions]], decrease the amount of fresh air available for dilution of air emissions, and increase the rate of production of secondary air pollutants.  CMAQ has the capability to accurately predict air pollution concentrations resulting from secondary formation.  Like any air dispersion model, CMAQ inputs air pollutant emissions and meteorological data and outputs air pollutant concentrations and deposited totals.  Its particular strength is in assessing the efficacy of regional emissions control strategies in reducing regional air pollution levels.

'''CMAQ''' may also refer to the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, a program of the [[United States Department of Transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement (CMAQ) Program|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/air_quality/cmaq/|website=U.S. Department of Transportation|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Cave of Dogs''' (in Italian ''Grotta del Cane'', literally "Cave of the Dog") is a small [[cave]] on the eastern side of the [[Phlegraean Fields]] near [[Pozzuoli]],  [[Naples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grotta del Cane: Italy|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/name.php?uni=-175146&amp;fid=3091&amp;c=italy|website=Geographical Names|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inside the cave is a [[fumarole]] that releases [[carbon dioxide]] of [[volcanic]] origin.  It was a famous, if gruesome, [[tourist attraction]] for travellers on the [[Grand Tour]].  The [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] gas, being denser than air, tends to accumulate in the deeper parts of the cave.  Local guides, for a fee, would suspend small animals inside it—usually dogs—until they became unconscious.  Because humans inhaled air from a higher level they were not affected.  The dogs might be revived by submerging them in the cold waters of the nearby [[Lake Agnano]].  Famous tourists who came to see this attraction included [[Goethe]], [[Alexandre Dumas]] père, and [[Mark Twain]]. The lake became polluted and it was drained in 1870; the spectacle fell into disuse and the cave was closed.  However the area is now being restored by volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Alfred Swaine, An Account of the Grotta del Cane; With Remarks Upon Suffocation by Carbonic Acid, The London Medical and Physical Journal, 1832, 278-285.[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=eegEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA278&amp;lpg=RA1-PA278&amp;dq=An+account+of+the+Grotta+del+Cane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uHmS5DBVLg&amp;sig=xizJ0VWyEyWaAedKYknv1pxUI0c&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1zMNVeeKIsvcapCcgoAC&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=An%20account%20of%20the%20Grotta%20del%20Cane&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fleming &amp; Johnson, Toxic Airs: Body, Place, Planet in Historical Perspective,  Pittsburgh, 255-256.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kroonenberg, Why Hell Stinks of Sulfur: Mythology and Geology of the Underworld, Chicago, 2013, 41-45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Matthews, Naples: Life, Death &amp; Miracles: Agnano &amp; the Grotto of the Dog.

The cave was often described in nineteenth century science textbooks to illustrate the [[density]] and toxicity of carbon dioxide,&lt;ref&gt;The above image is from L'air et le monde aèrien, an 1865 textbook by Arthur Mangin, p.162 [https://archive.org/details/lairetlemondear00manggoog]&lt;/ref&gt; and its reputation has given rise to a popular [[scientific demonstration]] of the same name.  Stepped candles are successively extinguished by tipping carbon dioxide into a transparent container.

The cave was recently investigated by Italian [[speleologists]] including Rosario Varriale who interpreted it as a man-made cavity constructed in [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], possibly as a [[sudatorium]]. The carbon dioxide level was measured at 9.9%.&lt;ref&gt;Napoli Underground, Grotta del Cane Nuove Ricerche.

The '''Corning Museum of Glass''' is a [[museum]] in [[Corning (city), New York|Corning, New York]] dedicated to the art, history and science of [[glass]]. It was founded in 1951 by [[Corning Incorporated|Corning Glass Works]] and currently has a collection of more than 45,000 glass objects, some over 3,500 years old.&lt;ref name=aboutus&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us: Corning Museum of Glass|url=http://www.cmog.org/about#.UUNVGhycd8E|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founded in 1951 by Corning Glass Works (now [[Corning Incorporated]]) as a gift to the nation for the company’s 100th anniversary, the Corning Museum of Glass is a not-for-profit museum dedicated to telling the story of a single material: glass. [[Thomas S. Buechner]], who would later become director of the [[Brooklyn Museum]], was the founding director of the glass museum, serving in the post from 1951 to 1960 and again from 1973 to 1980.

=== Growth and renovations ===
[[File:CorningGlassTower.jpg|thumb|250px|Tower sculpture consisting of 600 glass bowls]]
The original Museum and library were housed in a low, glass-walled building designed by [[Harrison &amp; Abramovitz]] in 1951. By 1978, the Museum had outgrown its space.  [[Gunnar Birkerts]] designed a new addition, creating a flowing series of galleries with the library at their core, linked to the old building via light-filled, windowed ramps. With memories of the 1972 hurricane still fresh (see Flood Damage), the new galleries were raised high above the flood line on concrete pillars. The new Museum opened to the public on May 28, 1980, exactly 29 years after its first opening.

By the early 1990s, the Corning Museum of Glass was once more overflowing its exhibition space, and increasing visitation put a strain on guest facilities. In 1996, the Museum embarked upon the first phase of a planned five-year, $65 million transformation. Under the directorship of Dr. [[David Whitehouse]], the first element to be added was The Studio. This state-of-the-art teaching facility for glassblowing and coldworking opened for classes in 1996.

Architects Smith-Miller + Hawkinson designed an addition to the main Museum building, using glass wherever possible to convey the beauty and elegance of the art form in the building itself. The Museum's renovation was completed in 2001, and included a new visitors' center, Sculpture Gallery, (now the Contemporary Glass Gallery), Hot Glass Show demonstration stage and a hands-on Innovation Center with exhibitions designed by [[Ralph Appelbaum Associates]]. A redesigned 18,000-square-foot (1,700 m2) GlassMarket, one of the largest Museum shops in the country, filled the entire first floor of the museum. The Rakow Library was relocated to new quarters across the Museum campus.

Over the past decade, the Museum’s collection, programs, and global impact have grown significantly. At the beginning of 2012, the Museum announced a $64 million expansion project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/52558/corning-museum-of-glass-thomas-phifer-and-partners-expansion/ |title=Largest Contemporary Glass Museum to Open in Upstate NY |publisher=Hyperallergic.com |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[Thomas Phifer]], to expand contemporary gallery and Hot Glass Show space. The new contemporary wing is slated to open in March 2015.&lt;ref name=june2012pr&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterbenk|first=Yvette|title=Corning Museum of Glass Unveils Plans for $64 Million Expansion|url=https://news.yahoo.com/corning-museum-glass-unveils-plans-64-million-expansion-110345959.html|work=June 6, 2012|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stargazette.com/story/news/local/2015/01/25/cmog-contemporary-glass/22313897/ |title=Corning glass museum acquires new contemporary pieces |publisher=Stargazette.com |date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theartnewspaper.com/articles/Cornings-glass-museum-acquires-contemporary-works-for-new-wing/36817 ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flood damage ===
In June 1972, disaster struck as [[Hurricane Agnes]] emptied a week's worth of rain into the surrounding Chemung River Valley. On June 23, the Chemung River overflowed its banks and poured five feet four inches of floodwater into the Museum. When the waters receded, staff members found glass objects tumbled in their cases and crusted with mud, the library's books swollen with water. The case holding 600 rare books tipped over, and the books were covered by mud and shards of glass panes. Half of the entire Library collection was damaged in the flood. According to Martin and Edwards, 528 of the Museum's 13,000 objects had sustained damage (1977, 11)&lt;ref name="flood"/&gt; At the time, Buechner described the flood as "possibly the greatest single catastrophe borne by an American museum."&lt;ref name="flood"/&gt;  Conservation was an immediate concern and staff moved quickly to freeze the flooded materials. Museum staff members, under the directorship of  [[Robert H. Brill]] were faced with the tremendous task of restoration: every glass object had to be meticulously cleaned and restored, while the library's contents had to be cleaned and dried page by page, slide by slide, even before being assessed for rebinding, restoration, or replacement.&lt;ref name=flood&gt;{{cite book|title=The Corning Flood: Museum Under Water|year=1977|publisher=Corning Museum of Glass|location=Corning, New York|isbn=087290-063-0|page=60|url=http://www.cmog.org/sites/default/files/collections/FF/FFAE9039-62D0-4450-A0ED-ACE0BD397297.pdf|editor=Martin, John H.|accessdate=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the extensive recovery efforts, the Library occupied an abandoned Acme grocery store across the street from the Museum. Altogether, staff and volunteers dried, cleaned, and restored over 7,000 water-logged, frozen books over the next 2 years. The rare books were sent to Carolyn Horton, a leading restoration expert, who disassembled, washed, deacidified and rebound them. On August 1, 1972, the Museum reopened with restoration work still underway.

== The Glass Collection ==
=== Galleries ===
The Museum's Glass Collection showcases more than 35 centuries of glass artistry. The Museum's collection of contemporary artworks includes pieces by significant artists such as [[Klaus Moje]], [[Karen LaMonte]], [[Bruno Pedrosa]], [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Libenský / Brychtová]] and [[Josiah McElheny]]. The Glass Collection Galleries show the most comprehensive and celebrated glass collection in the world. The galleries explore Near Eastern, Asian, European, and American glass and glassmaking from antiquity through present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Lawrence|first=Lee|date=August 9, 2011|title=Art, technology, design, crisscrossing the globe [exhibition review]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303544604576429774286392838 | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2015-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They tell the story of glass creation, from a full-scale model of an Egyptian furnace, to the grand factories of Europe, to the small-scale furnaces that fueled the Studio Glass movement that began in America in 1962. The galleries contain objects representing every country and historical period in which glassmaking has been practiced. The galleries include: Glass in Nature, Origins of Glassmaking, Glass of the Romans, Glass in the Islamic World, Early Northern European Glass, The Rise of Venetian Glassmaking, Glass in 17th-19th Century Europe, 19th Century European Glass, Asian Glass, Glass in America, Corning: From Farm Town to “Crystal City,” Paperweights of the World and Modern Glass.

In addition to these galleries, there is the Jerome and Lucille Strauss Study Gallery, Frederick Carder Gallery and Ben W. Heineman Sr. Gallery of Contemporary Glass. The Study Gallery is filled with a wide range of objects from all periods. The gallery is named after Museum benefactors Jerome and Lucille Strauss, who, by gift and bequest, provided the Museum with an unparalleled collection of 2,400 drinking glasses dating from ancient to modern times. The Frederick Carder Gallery features an extensive collection of glass designed by [[Frederick Carder]] (1863–1963), a gifted English designer who managed Steuben Glass Works from its founding in 1903 until 1932. During this time, the production of Steuben changed from various types of colored glass to colorless glass.

The Museum’s gallery of contemporary glass focuses on vessels, objects, sculptures, and installations made by international artists over the last 25 years. The purpose of the gallery is to show the different ways in which glass is used as a medium for contemporary art. The gallery is named for the Ben W. Heineman Sr. family, who donated a major collection of contemporary glass to the Museum in 2005.

=== Exhibitions ===
The Corning Museum of Glass offers exhibitions year-round. Past exhibitions have included: [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/medieval-glass#.UUMv4xycd8E Medieval Glass for Popes, Princes and Peasants], [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/east-meets-west-cross-cultural-influences-glassmaking-18th-and-19th-centuries#.UUMwDhycd8E East Meets West: Cross-Cultural Influences in Glassmaking in the 18th and 19th Centuries] and [http://www.cmog.org/collection/exhibitions/mirror-to-discovery#.UUMwQhycd8E Mirror to Discovery: The 200-Inch Disk and the Hale Reflecting Telescope at Palomar]. Several special exhibitions are offered at the Museum and the Rakow Research Library each year, from shows focused on specific artists to major exhibitions on important topics in glass and glass history.&lt;ref name=2008nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|title=Roman Inspirations at Corning Glass Show|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/18/arts/design/18anti.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes%20Topics%2FSubjects%2FA%2FAntiques|accessdate=16 March 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Innovation Center ===
In the Glass Innovation Center, visitors can meet the inventors whose ideas changed the world. At the Innovation Center guests have the opportunity to dabble with glass chemistry, experience the power of optical fiber and see themselves in the strange reflection of a flight simulator mirror. The Innovation Center galleries currently on display include the Optics Gallery, Vessels Gallery and Windows Gallery. A 300-foot bridge connects three floating pavilions.

=== The Rakow Commission ===
Inaugurated in 1986 by The Corning Museum of Glass, the Rakow Commission supports the development of new works of art in glass. This program, which provides $25,000 each year, is made possible through the generosity of the late Dr. and Mrs. Leonard S. Rakow, who were Museum Fellows, friends, and benefactors of the Museum. Each commissioned work is added to the Museum's collection and is displayed publicly for the first time during the annual Seminar.&lt;ref&gt;Corning Museum of Glass unveils 2012 Rakow Commission by Danish artist Steffen Dam.

==== Hot Glass Show ====
The Hot Glass Show is a demonstration where one of the museum’s glass blowers provides a live glass blowing demonstration, which is also narrated by another of the glass blowers. The Hot Glass Show is performed at the Museum, on the road, and at sea on three Celebrity Cruise ships.

===== At the Museum =====
At the Museum,&lt;ref&gt;Pogrebin, Robin. “Corning Museum to Get New Wing.” (2012, June 6). New York Times. Section: Arts Beat. &lt;http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/museum-of-glass-to-get-new-wing/&gt;. Access: Nov. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the Hot Glass Show is offered all day, every day and is included in the cost of admission. At each demonstration, the glassmaker takes a glob of molten glass and shapes the globs into vases, bowls, or sculptures. Throughout the demonstration, a narrator describes the process, and cameras give viewers a close-up look into the furnaces where the glass is heated. The show gives viewers a look into an ancient Roman technique that is still used today for glass making. Each show lasts between 20–40 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Details glass blowing in Corning, N.Y. November 18, 2001. Washington Post. Accessed on LexisNexis. http://www.lexisnexis.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hot Glass Roadshow =====
The Museum takes the Hot Glass Show on the road, bringing the unique demonstration to the public, designers, and other museums. The Museum uses unique equipment in order to recreate the state-of-the-art studio environment. The Hot Glass Roadshow travels internationally.&lt;ref&gt;“High Museum of Art Presents the Hot Glass Roadshow.” (2012, Aug. 28). High Museum of Art: Press Release. &lt; http://www.high.org/Press/Press-Releases/2012/August/Hot-Glass-Roadshow.aspx&gt;. Access: Nov. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== At sea =====
The demonstration is also presented on Celebrity cruise ships, such as Celebrity Solstice, Celebrity Equinox, and Celebrity Eclipse. Each cruise ship has a hotshop on the top deck where the Museum’s glassmakers present their live glassmaking demonstrations. The demos reach more than 300,000 people each year, and the ships visit ports around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Celebrity eclipse launch: these pros are a glass act. Washington Post. April 30, 2010. Travel Trade Gazette UK &amp; Ireland http://business.highbeam.com/409990/article-1G1-225419675/celebrity-eclipse-launch-these-pros-glass-act&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Flameworking Demonstration ====
The demo is a live, 15-minute narrated demonstration of glassworking at a 5,000 degree Fahrenheit gas- and oxygen-powered torch. The show is also included in the cost of admission, and is offered throughout the day in the Museum’s Glass Innovation Center. During the show, the glassmaker melts rods and tubes of glass to shape them into a variety of shapes from animals, beads, ornaments, sculptures and vessels. The [[flameworking]] technique is an ancient glass making technique, which is demonstrated at the Museum.

==== Optical Fiber Demo ====
The Optical Fiber Demo explains how thin threads of glass can carry enormous amounts of digital information and power our high-speed information age. The demo lasts about 15 minutes, is offered every day, and is included in the cost of admission. The demonstration takes place in the museum’s Glass Innovation Center. Demonstrators show how light can be used for communication, how glass can accurately carry light signals, what glass composition will carry light signals most clearly, and how optical fiber provides us with the massive amounts of bandwidth necessary for today’s world. The presentation begins with a discussion of how man has been using light to communicate for centuries. It continues with a demonstration of total internal reflection – the basic principle behind optical fiber. In the mid-1800s, Daniel Colladon, a Swiss scientist, explained how total internal reflection allowed light to be directed along a very specific path with lively visible demonstrations that showed light following the path of a stream of falling water. Total internal reflection traps the light in the stream, and traps it the same way in a glass fiber.

==== Glassbreaking Demo ====
The demonstration is a 15-minute demo that explores how glass breaks and why. Demonstrators show how glass can become stronger or weaker depending on how it is heated or cooled; demonstrators explain how this phenomenon affects the way it breaks. The demonstration takes place in the Windows Gallery of the Museum’s Innovation Center and the demo is included in the cost of admission.

The Corning Museum of Glass actively researches, publishes, and provides lectures about a broad range of [http://www.cmog.org/research/all-about-glass#.UUM2jRycd8E glass topics]. The museum hosts The [http://www.cmog.org/research/library#.UUM2vxycd8E Rakow Research Library], which houses the world’s most comprehensive collection of materials on the art and history of glass and glassmaking (and is open to the public).

=== Rakow Research Library ===
The Rakow Research Library, founded as part of The Corning Museum of Glass in 1951,&lt;ref&gt;Czarnecki, John E. “Juliette K. &amp; Leonard S. Rakow Research Library, Corning Museum of Glass.” (2001). Architectural Record. &lt; http://archrecord.construction.com/projects/bts/archives/adaptivereuse/corning/overview.asp&gt;. Access: Nov 2. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; is a public institution that houses the world's most comprehensive collection of materials on the art and history of glass and glassmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Reif, Rita. “Antiques; Glass Fit for n Emperor.” (1987, May 3). New	York Times. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/03/arts/antiques-glass-fit-for-an-emperor.html?src=pm&gt;. Access: Nov. 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The Library Collection ranges from medieval manuscripts to original works of art on paper to the latest information on techniques used by studio artists. More than 130 archives contain unique material from individual artists, galleries, companies, scholars, and organizations. The Library also presents exhibitions featuring rare items from its collection. In 1985, the Museum library was renamed the [http://www.cmog.org/research/library#.UUM24Rycd8E Leonard S. and Juliette K. Rakow Library] in honor of Dr. and Mrs. Rakow, who gave generously to the library as well as bequeathing part of their glass collection to the Museum and endowing research grants and commissions. The collection does not circulate. However, the Library is a member of the Online Computer Library Center, Inc. (OCLC), an international bibliographic service, and microfiche copies of books on glass and photocopies of periodical articles can be borrowed through interlibrary loan.&lt;ref&gt;Kammen, Michael. “Getting a Clear Focus on the World of Glass.” (1986, May 18). New York Times. &lt; https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/travel/getting-a-clear-focus-on-the-world-of-glass.html?pagewanted=all&gt;. Access: Nov 2. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Online resources ===
Not only does the Museum have an extensive library, but the Museum provides online resources such as “[http://www.cmog.org/research/all-about-glass#.UUM98hycd8E All About Glass],” which provides full-text articles, virtual books and videos about glass.

=== Rakow Grant for Glass Research ===
The Corning Museum of Glass sponsors the Rakow Grant for Glass Research, which makes available one or more annual awards totaling up to $10,000. The program is made possible through the generosity of the late Dr. and Mrs. Leonard S. Rakow, who were fellows, friends, and benefactors of the Museum. The purpose of this grant is to foster scholarly research in the history of glass and glassmaking.

=== Scientific Research ===
Since 1960, the Scientific Research Department of The Corning Museum of Glass has pioneered the application of numerous scientific techniques to the examination of historical glass artifacts and to the study of the history of glassmaking. Some of this research has focused on the Museum’s collections, but most of it has been conducted in collaboration with archaeologists and scientists from all over the world. The findings of this research have been shared in more than 190 publications on the archaeology, chemistry, and conservation of glass. Many of these publications are now out-of-print or originally appeared in sources that are no longer readily accessible.

The Museum’s searchable database brings this scholarship to the attention of scholars and scientists who might not otherwise be aware of it. Approximately one-quarter of the content is accessible in full-text format. Publications not available in full-text may be accessed through the Museum's [http://www.cmog.org/research/library#.UUM24Rycd8E Rakow Research Library].

'''Corpus Córporum''' (Lat. "the collection of collections") or in full, ''Corpus Córporum: repositorium operum latinorum apud universitatem Turicensem'', is a digital [[Medieval Latin]] library developed by the [[University of Zurich]], Institute for Greek and Latin Philology. As of May 2016, the repository contains a total of 137,982,350 words, including the entire [[Patrologia Latina]], the [[Vulgate]], Corpus Thomisticum and numerous other medieval and [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]] collections of religious, literary and scientific texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/index.php?lang=0 Link to home page] of the project.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The non-commercial site, still under development (''in statu nascendi'') at mlat.uzh.ch, is conceived as a text (meta-)repository with a set of research tools. It is being developed under the direction of Phillip Roelli, and it uses only free and open software.

The project aims to provide a platform for standardised (TEI) xml-files of copyright-free Latin texts; to make the texts searchable in complex manners; and to function as an online platform for the publication of Latin texts (e.g. the [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall|Richard Rufus]] Project's corpus at Stanford University).

Texts are divided into searchable corpora on specific topics, e.g. one corpus consists of ten Latin translations of Aristotle's ''Physica''.&lt;ref&gt;Project's [http://mlat.uzh.ch/MLS/index.php?lang=0 About page].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crystal Cubism''' (French: ''Cubisme cristal'' or ''Cubisme de cristal'') is a distilled form of [[Cubism]] consistent with a shift, between 1915 and 1916, towards a strong emphasis on flat surface activity and large overlapping geometric planes. The primacy of the underlying geometric structure, rooted in the abstract, controls practically all of the elements of the artwork.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987"&gt;Christopher Green, ''Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916&amp;ndash;1928'', Yale University Press, New Haven and London, 1987, pp. 13-47, 215&lt;/ref&gt;

This range of [[Style (visual arts)|styles]] of painting and sculpture, especially significant between 1917 and 1920 (also referred to as the ''Crystal Period'', ''classical Cubism'', ''pure Cubism'', ''advanced Cubism'', ''late Cubism'', ''synthetic Cubism'', or the ''second phase of Cubism''), was practiced in varying degrees by a multitude of artists; particularly those under contract with the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]—[[Henri Laurens]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Juan Gris]] and [[Jacques Lipchitz]] most noticeably of all. The tightening of the compositions, the clarity and sense of order reflected in these works, led to its being referred to by the French poet and art critic [[Maurice Raynal]] as 'crystal' Cubism.&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[https://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020545 Christopher Green, ''Late Cubism'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Considerations manifested by Cubists prior to the outset of [[World War I]]—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, the occult, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been vacated, replaced by a purely formal frame of reference that proceeded from a cohesive stance toward art and life.

As post-war reconstruction began, so too did a series of exhibitions at Léonce Rosenberg's [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]]: order and the allegiance to the aesthetically pure remained the prevailing tendency. The collective phenomenon of Cubism once again—now in its advanced revisionist form—became part of a widely discussed development in French culture. Crystal Cubism was the culmination of a continuous narrowing of scope in the name of a [[return to order]]; based upon the observation of the artists relation to nature, rather than on the nature of reality itself.&lt;ref name="Inside Modernism"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=gpPDpEYRA90C&amp;pg=PA88&amp;lpg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Crystal+Cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HsCDYfw3KE&amp;sig=nw_h8YuUu7Q9HjoPJIFfwCbTsgE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pKpiVZiMGszcUfGjgKgN&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Crystal%20Cubism%22&amp;f=false Thomas Vargish, Delo E. Mook, ''Inside Modernism: Relativity Theory, Cubism, Narrative'', Yale University Press, 1999], p. 88, {{ISBN|0300076134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Cubism, and its associative ''rappel à l’ordre'', has been linked with an inclination—by those who served the armed forces and by those who remained in the civilian sector—to escape the realities of the Great War, both during and directly following the conflict. The purifying of Cubism from 1914 through the mid-1920s, with its cohesive unity and voluntary constraints, has been linked to a much broader [[Ideology|ideological]] transformation towards [[conservatism]] in both French society and [[Culture of France|French culture]]. In terms of the separation of culture and life, the Crystal Cubist period emerges as the most important in the history of [[Modernism]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

==Background==

===Beginnings: Cézanne===
[[File:Paul Cézanne, 1888, Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin), oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, Pushkin Museum.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Paul Cézanne]], 1888, ''Mardi gras (Pierrot et Arlequin)'', oil on canvas, 102 x 81 cm, [[Pushkin Museum]], Moscow]]
Cubism, from its inception, stems from the dissatisfaction with the ''idea of form'' that had been in practiced since the [[Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic Albert Gleizes, ''L'Epopée'', written in 1925, published in ''Le Rouge et le Noir'', 1929. First published under the title ''Kubismus'', 1928.  English translation, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form'', by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt; This dissatisfaction had already been seen in the works of the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[Eugène Delacroix]], in the [[Realism (art)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]], in passing through the [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolists]], [[Les Nabis]], the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]] and the [[Neo-Impressionism|Neo-Impressionists]]. [[Paul Cézanne]] was instrumental, as his work marked a shift from a more representational art form to one that was increasingly abstract, with a strong emphasis on the simplification of geometric structure. In a letter addressed to [[Émile Bernard]] dated 15 April 1904, Cézanne writes: "Interpret nature in terms of the cylinder, the sphere, the cone; put everything in perspective, so that each side of an object, of a plane, recedes toward a central point."&lt;ref name="Erle Lora"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vpbEHESVx9cC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=Cézanne,+le+cylindres,+sphères,+et+le+cônes&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VWN2A52aTk&amp;sig=kFqKvxXeu6Q_DgjHn2GAb6TDbFE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=VpsqUenwBom3hAfVvIGADg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwDA#v=onepage&amp;q=cylinder%2C%20sphere%2C%20cone&amp;f=false Erle Lora, ''Cézannes Composition: Analysis of His Form with Diagrams and Photographs of His Motifs''], Forward by Richard Shiff, University of California Press, 30 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Cézanne was preoccupied by the means of rendering volume and space, surface variations (or modulations) with overlapped shifting planes. Increasingly in his later works, Cézanne achieves a greater freedom. His work became bolder, more arbitrary, more dynamic and increasingly nonrepresentational. As his color planes acquired greater formal independence, defined objects and structures began to lose their identity.&lt;ref name="Erle Lora" /&gt;

===The first phase===
{{main article|Proto-Cubism}}
[[File:Georges Braque, 1908, Maisons et arbre, oil on canvas, 40.5 x 32.5 cm, Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art.jpg|thumb|Georges Braque, 1908, ''Maisons et arbre'' (''[[Houses at l'Estaque]]''), oil on canvas, 40.5 x 32.5 cm, [[Lille Métropole Museum of Modern, Contemporary and Outsider Art]]]]
Artists at the forefront of the Parisian art scene at the outset of the 20th century would not fail to notice the tendencies toward abstraction inherent in the work of Cézanne, and ventured still further.&lt;ref name="Robert Herbert"&gt;Robert L. Herbert, 1968, ''Neo-Impressionism'', The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; A reevaluation in their own work in relation to that of Cézanne had begun following a series of retrospective exhibitions of Cézanne's paintings held at the [[Salon d'Automne]] of 1904, the Salon d'Automne of 1905 and 1906, followed by two commemorative retrospectives after his death in 1907.&lt;ref name="Robbins, Moser"&gt;Daniel Robbins, Joann Moser, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; By 1907, representational form gave way to a new complexity; subject matter progressively became dominated by a network of interconnected geometric planes, the distinction between foreground and background no longer sharply delineated, and the depth of field limited.&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/chronology Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes, Chronology of his life, 1881-1953'']&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1911 [[Salon des Indépendants]], an exhibition which officially introduced "Cubism" to the public as an organized group movement, and extending through 1913, the [[fine art]]s had evolved well beyond the teachings of Cézanne. Where before, the foundational pillars of academicism had been shaken, now they had been toppled.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; "It was a total regeneration", writes Gleizes, "indicating the emergence of a wholly new cast of mind. Every season it appeared renewed, growing like a living body. Its enemies could, eventually, have forgiven it if only it had passed away, like a fashion; but they became even more violent when they realized that it was destined to live a life that would be longer than that of those painters who had been the first to assume the responsibility for it".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; 
The evolution towards rectilinearity and simplified forms continued through 1909 with greater emphasis on clear geometric principles; visible in the works of [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Georges Braque]], [[Jean Metzinger]], [[Albert Gleizes]], [[Henri Le Fauconnier]] and [[Robert Delaunay]].&lt;ref name="Brooke, Gleizes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 – 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', Edition Figuière, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pre-war: analysis and synthesis====
The Cubist method leading to 1912 has been considered 'analytical', entailing the decomposition of the subject matter (the study of things), while subsequently 'synthetic', built on geometric construction (free of such primary study). The terms Analytic Cubism and Synthetic Cubism originated through this distinction.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; By 1913 Cubism had transformed itself considerably in the range of spatial effects.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; At the 1913 Salon des Indépendants Jean Metzinger exhibited his monumental ''[[L'Oiseau bleu (Metzinger)|L'Oiseau bleu]]''; Robert Delaunay ''L'équipe du Cardiff F.C.''; [[Fernand Léger]] ''Le modèle nu dans l'atelier''; Juan Gris ''L'Homme au Café''; and Albert Gleizes ''[[Les Joueurs de football]]''. At the 1913 Salon d'Automne, a salon in which the predominating tendency was Cubism, Metzinger exhibited ''[[En Canot]]''; Gleizes ''Les Bâteaux de Pêche''; and [[Roger de La Fresnaye]] ''La Conquête de l'Air''.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; In these works, more so than before, can be seen the importance of the geometric plane in the overall composition.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt;

Historically, the first phase of Cubism is identified as much by the inventions of Picasso and Braque (amongst the so-called Gallery Cubists) as it is with the common interests towards geometrical structure of Metzinger, Gleizes, Delaunay and Le Fauconnier (the Salon Cubists).&lt;ref name="Gris"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=correspondence+Juan+Gris,+Maurice+Raynal&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=omG4wHCpDC&amp;sig=jyC3HCXNGm4X7vTF98ybQOyk3Wc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qeprVfHJBMz9Ur-NgLAI&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=correspondence%20Juan%20Gris%2C%20Maurice%20Raynal&amp;f=false Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin von Maur, Whitechapel Art Gallery, ''Juan Gris: Whitechapel Art Gallery, London, 18 September -29 November 1992: Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, 18 December 1992 - 14 February 1993: Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, 6 March - 2 May 1993'', Yale University Press, 1992, pp. 6, 22-60]. {{ISBN|0300053746}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Cubism would evolve pictorially, so too would the crystallization of its theoretical framework advance beyond the guidelines set out in the Cubist manifesto ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'', written by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger in 1912; though ''Du "Cubisme"'' would remain the clearest and most intelligible definition of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

===War years: 1914-1918===

At the outset of the First World War many artists were mobilized: Metzinger, Gleizes, Braque, Léger, de La Fresnaye, and [[Raymond Duchamp-Villon|Duchamp-Villon]]. Despite the brutal interruption, each found the time to continue making art, sustaining differing types of Cubism. Yet they discovered a ubiquitous link between the Cubist syntax (beyond pre-war attitudes) and that of the anonymity and novelty of mechanized warfare. Cubism evolved as much a result of an ''evasion'' of the inconceivable atrocities of war as of nationalistic pressures. Along with the evasion came the need to diverge further and further away from the depiction of things. As the rift between art and life grew, so too came the burgeoning need for a process of distillation.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

This period of profound reflection contributed to the constitution of a new [[mindset]]; a prerequisite for fundamental change. The ''flat surface'' became the starting point for a revaluation of the fundamental principles of painting.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; Rather than relying on the purely intellectual, the focus now was on the immediate experience of the senses, based on the idea according to Gleizes, that form, 'changing the directions of its movement, will change its dimensions' ["La forme, modifiant ses directions, modifiait ses dimensions"], while revealing the "basic elements" of painting, the "true, solid rules - rules which could be generally applied". It was Metzinger and Gris who, again according to Gleizes, "did more than anyone else to fix the basic elements... the first principles of the order that was being born".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; "But Metzinger, clear-headed as a physicist, had already discovered those rudiments of construction without which nothing can be done."&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Epic" /&gt; Ultimately, it was Gleizes who would take the synthetic factor furthest of all.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

The divers Cubist considerations manifested prior to World War I—such as the [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]], dynamism of modern life, and [[Henri Bergson]]'s concept of [[Duration (philosophy)|duration]]—had now been replaced by a formal reference frame which constituted the second phase of Cubism, based upon an elementary set of principles that formed a cohesive Cubist aesthetic.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; This clarity and sense of order spread to almost all of the artists exhibiting at [[Léonce Rosenberg]]'s gallery—including Jean Metzinger, Juan Gris, [[Jacques Lipchitz]], [[Henry Laurens]], [[Auguste Herbin]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Gino Severini]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]—leading to the descriptive term 'Crystal Cubism', coined by [[Maurice Raynal]],&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; an early promoter of Cubism and continuous supporter during the war and post-war phase that followed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/research/leonard-lauder-research-center/programs-and-resources/index-of-cubist-art-collectors/lipchitz Anna Jozefacka, Leonard A. Lauder, Research Center for Modern Art, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, January 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; Raynal had been associated with Cubists since 1910 via the milieu of [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=o3vSvh8CytIC&amp;pg=PA140-IA2&amp;lpg=PA140-IA2&amp;dq=%22maurice+raynal%22+%22Cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wPTwqcaO1W&amp;sig=9uerz0v0Z8jtg_r2_XRoo6cQhe4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cxBoVZ6TB4HjUvmKgLAJ&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22maurice%20raynal%22%20%22Cubism%22&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism in the Shadow of War: The Avant-garde and Politics in Paris 1905-1914'', Yale University Press, 1998, p. 152], {{ISBN|0300075294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raynal, who would become one of the Cubists most authoritative and articulate proponents,&lt;ref name="Cottington 2004"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=KFGgxn7lfq0C&amp;pg=PA151&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;dq=%22maurice+raynal%22+%22Cubism%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rn_yvibRnH&amp;sig=8zEhc9vn47tuHhEKSvQ80UP1kUE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mxNoVaKaHIqsU6uxgZAE&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=raynal&amp;f=false David Cottington, ''Cubism and Its Histories'', Manchester University Press, 2004, pp. 151-153], {{ISBN|0719050049}}&lt;/ref&gt; endorsed a wide range of Cubist activity and for those who produced it, but his highest esteem was directed toward two artists: Jean Metzinger, whose artistry Raynal equated with [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]] and who was 'perhaps the man who, in our epoch, knows best how to paint'. The other was Juan Gris, who was 'certainly the fiercest of the purists in the group'.&lt;ref name="Cottington 2004" /&gt;

In 1915, while serving on the front line, Raynal suffered a minor shrapnel wound to the knee from exploding enemy artillery fire, though the injury did not necessitate his evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/L'Intransigeant/1915/7/9 ''L'Intransigeant'', 9 July 1915, p. 2, National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning from the front line, Raynal served briefly as director for publications of Rosenberg's l'Effort moderne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/ ''Le Siècle'', 8 April 1919, p. 3, National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k74806n/f108.image ''Lectures'', Le Nouveau Spectateur, No. 5, 10 July 1919, Gallica, Bibliothèque nationale de France]&lt;/ref&gt; For Raynal, research into art was based on an eternal truth, rather than on the ideal, on reality, or on certitude. Certitude was nothing more than based on a relative belief, while truth was in agreement with fact. The only belief was in the veracity of philosophical and scientific truths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k56993423/texteBrut Maurice Raynal, ''Quelques Intentions du Cubisme'', éditions de L'Effort moderne, Paris, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;

"Direct reference to observed reality" is present, but the emphasis is placed on the "self-sufficiency" of the artwork as objects unto themselves. The priority on "orderly qualities" and the "autonomous purity" of compositions are a prime concern, writes art historian Christopher Green.&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; Crystal Cubism also coincided with the emergence of a methodical framework of theoretical essays on the topic,&lt;ref name="MoMA" /&gt; by Albert Gleizes, Juan Gris, Fernand Léger, [[Gino Severini]], Pierre Reverdy, Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler, and Maurice Raynal.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

===Metzinger===
Even before Raynal coined the term Crystal Cubism, one critic by the name of Aloës Duarvel, writing in ''L'Elan'', referred to Metzinger's entry exhibited at Galerie [[Bernheim-Jeune]] as 'jewellery' ("joaillerie").&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaf191601-01.2.19&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# ''La Tombola artistique au profit des artistes polonais victimes de la guerre'', 28 décembre 1915 au 15 janvier 1916, Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, 25, boulevard de la Madeleine, published in L'Elan, Number 8, January 1916]&lt;/ref&gt; Another critic, Aurel, writing in ''L'Homme Enchaîné'' about the same December 1915 exhibition described Metzinger's entry as "a very erudite divagation of horizon blue and old red of glory, in the name of which I forgive him" [''une divagation fort érudite en bleu horizon et vieux rouge de gloire, au nom de quoi je lui pardonne''].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k75938157/f1.image ''Échos, 1915 et la peinture'', L'Homme Enchaîné, Paris, A3, No. 455, Saturday, 8 January 1916 (front page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the year 1916, Sunday discussions at the studio of Lipchitz, included Metzinger, Gris, Picasso, [[Diego Rivera]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], [[André Salmon]], [[Max Jacob]], and [[Blaise Cendrars]].&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins"&gt;Daniel Robbins, ''Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism'', 1985, ''Jean Metzinger in Retrospect'', The University of Iowa Museum of Art, J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press, pp. 9–24&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter written in Paris by Metzinger to Albert Gleizes in Barcelona during the war, dated 4 July 1916, he writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;After two years of study I have succeeded in establishing the basis of this new perspective I have talked about so much. It is not the materialist perspective of Gris, nor the romantic perspective of Picasso. It is rather a metaphysical perspective—I take full responsibility for the word. You can't begin to imagine what I've found out since the beginning of the war, working outside painting but for painting. The geometry of the fourth space has no more secret for me. Previously I had only intuitions, now I have certainty. I have made a whole series of theorems on the laws of displacement [''déplacement''], of reversal [''retournement''] etc. I have read [[Pieter Hendrik Schoute|Schoute]], [[Bernhard Riemann|Rieman]] (sic), [[Jean-Robert Argand|Argand]], [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] etc.

The actual result? A new harmony. Don't take this word harmony in its ordinary [''banal''] everyday sense, take it in its original [''primitif''] sense. Everything is number. The mind [''esprit''] hates what cannot be measured: it must be reduced and made comprehensible.

That is the secret. There in nothing more to it [''pas de reste à l'opération'']. Painting, sculpture, music, architecture, ''lasting art'' is never anything more than a mathematical expression of the relations that exist between the internal and the external, the self [''le moi''] and the world. (Metzinger, 4 July 1916)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20One/analytical%20and%20synthetic.html#anchor212039 Peter Brooke, ''Higher Geometries, Precedents: Charles Henry and Peter Lenz, The subjective experience of space, Metzinger, Gris and Maurice Princet'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 'new perspective' according to [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "was a mathematical relationship between the ideas in his mind and the exterior world".&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; The 'fourth space' for Metzinger was the space of the mind.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;
 
In a second letter to Gleizes, dated 26 July 1916, Metzinger writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If painting was an end in itself it would enter into the category of the minor arts which appeal only to physical pleasure... No. Painting is a language—and it has its syntax and its laws. To shake up that framework a bit to give more strength or life to what you want to say, that isn't just a right, it's a duty; but you must never lose sight of the End. The End, however, isn't the subject, nor the object, nor even the picture—the End, it is the idea. (Metzinger, 26 July 1916)&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Continuing, Metzinger mentions the differences between himself and Juan Gris:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone from whom I feel ever more distant is Juan Gris. I admire him but I cannot understand why he wears himself out with decomposing objects. Myself, I am advancing towards synthetic unity and I don't analyze any more. I take from things what seems to me to have meaning and be most suitable to express my thought. I want to be direct, like Voltaire. No more metaphors. Ah those stuffed tomatoes of all the St-Pol-Roux of painting.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some of the ideas expressed in these letters to Gleizes were reproduced in an article written by the writer, poet, and critique [[Paul Dermée]], published in the magazine ''[[Pierre Albert-Birot|SIC]]'' in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaz19190330-01.2.14&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# ''Jean Metzinger, Une Esthétique'', by Paul Dermée, SIC, Volume 4, Nos. 42, 43, March 30 and April 15, 1919, p. 336]. Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; but the existence of letters themselves remained unknown until the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;

While Metzinger's process of distillation is already noticeable during the latter half of 1915, and conspicuously extending into early 1916, this shift is signaled in the works of Gris and Lipchitz from the latter half of 1916, and particularly between 1917 and 1918. Metzinger's radical geometrization of form as an underlying architectural basis for his 1915-16 compositions is already visible in his work circa 1912-13, in paintings such as ''[[Au Vélodrome]]'' (1912) and ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' (c.1913). Where before, the perception of depth had been greatly reduced, now, the depth of field was no greater than a bas-relief.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Metzinger's evolution toward synthesis has its origins in the configuration of flat squares, trapezoidal and rectangular planes that overlap and interweave, a "new perspective" in accord with the "laws of displacement". In the case of ''[[Le Fumeur]]'' Metzinger filled in these simple shapes with gradations of color, wallpaper-like patterns and rhythmic curves. So too in ''[[Au Vélodrome]]''. But the underlying armature upon which all is built is palpable. Vacating these non-essential features would lead Metzinger on a path towards ''[[Soldier at a Game of Chess]]'' (1914–15), and a host of other works created after the artist's demobilization as a medical orderly during the war, such as ''L'infirmière'' (''The Nurse'') location unknown, and ''[[Femme au miroir]]'', private collection.

&lt;blockquote&gt;If the beauty of a painting solely depends on its pictorial qualities: only retaining certain elements, those that seem to suit our need for expression, then with these elements, building a new object, an object which we can adapt to the surface of the painting without subterfuge. If that object looks like something known, I take it increasingly for something of no use. For me it is enough for it to be "well done", to have a perfect accord between the parts and the whole. (Jean Metzinger, quoted in ''Au temps des Cubistes, 1910-1920'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-femme-et-paysage-a-laqueduc-5556907-details.aspx#top Jean Metzinger, quoted in ''Au temps des Cubistes, 1910-1920'', exhibition catalogue, Paris, Galerie Berès, 2006, p. 432. Reproduced in Christie's Paris, 2 May 2012, Lot 23 notes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For Metzinger, the Crystal period was synonymous with a return to "a simple, robust art".&lt;ref name="Metzinger"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/modernfrenc00rayn Jean Metzinger, quoted in [[Maurice Raynal]], ''Modern French Painters'', Tudor Publishing Co., New York, 1934, p. 125] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150606010101/https://archive.org/details/modernfrenc00rayn |date=2015-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Crystal Cubism represented an opening up of possibilities. His belief was that technique should be simplified and that the "trickery" of [[chiaroscuro]] should abandoned, along with the "artifices of the palette".&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt; He felt the need to do without the "multiplication of tints and detailing of forms without reason, by feeling":&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

:"Feeling! It is like the expression of the old-school tragedian in acting! I want clear ideas, frank colors. 'No color, nothing but nuance', [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]] used to say; but Verlaine is dead, and Homer is not afraid to handle color". (Metzinger)&lt;ref name="Metzinger" /&gt;

Juan Gris' late arrival on the Cubist scene (1912) saw him influenced by the leaders of the movement: Picasso, of the 'Gallery Cubists' and Metzinger of the 'Salon Cubists'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=d5wXeMFxA2IC&amp;pg=PA90&amp;lpg=PA90&amp;dq=John+Golding,+Visions+of+the+Modern,+seen+by+many+as+the+leader+of+the+%27Salon%27+Cubists John Golding, ''Visions of the Modern''], University of California Press, 1994, {{ISBN|0520087925}}, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aN9MriMKsE ''Picasso Posse: The Mona Lisa of Cubism'', Michael Taylor, 2010, Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1 Audio Stop 439, Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; His entry at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants, ''Hommage à Pablo Picasso'', was also an homage to Metzinger's ''[[Le goûter (Tea Time)#The total image|Le goûter (Tea Time)]]''. ''Le goûter'' persuaded Gris of the importance of mathematics (numbers) in painting.&lt;ref&gt;''John Richardson: A Life of Picasso, volume II, 1907–1917'', ''The Painter of Modern Life'', Jonathan Cape, London, 1996, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt;

As art historian Peter Brooke points out, Gris started painting persistently in 1911 and first exhibited at the 1912 Salon des Indépendants (a painting entitled ''Hommage à Pablo Picasso''). "He appears with two styles", writes Brooke, "In one of them a grid structure appears that is clearly reminiscent of the ''Goûter'' and of Metzinger's later work in 1912. In the other, the grid is still present but the lines are not stated and their continuity is broken".&lt;ref name="P. Brooke"&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/Du%20Cubisme/Part%20One/geometries Peter Brooke, ''On "Cubism" in context'', online since 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Christopher Green writes that the "deformations of lines" allowed by mobile perspective in the head of Metzinger's ''Tea-time'' and Gleizes's ''[[Portrait of Jacques Nayral]]'' "have seemed tentative to historians of Cubism. In 1911, as the key area of likeness and unlikeness, they more than anything released the laughter." Green continues, "This was the wider context of Gris's decision at the Indépendants of 1912 to make his debut with a ''Homage to Pablo Picasso'', which was a portrait, and to do so with a portrait that responded to Picasso's portraits of 1910 through the intermediary of Metzinger's ''Tea-time''.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QsMZQW1LpCkC&amp;pg=PA116&amp;lpg=PA116&amp;dq=juan+gris+portrait+of+Picasso,+Metzinger+tea-time Christopher Green, Christian Derouet, Karin Von Maur, ''Juan Gris: &amp;#91;catalogue of the Exhibition&amp;#93;'', 1992, London and Otterlo, p. 160]&lt;/ref&gt; While Metzinger's distillation is noticeable during the latter half of 1915 and early 1916, this shift is signaled in the works of Gris and Lipchitz from the latter half of 1916, and particularly between 1917 and 1918.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|Kahnweiler]] dated the shift in style of Juan Gris to the summer and autumn of 1916, following the ''[[Pointillism|pointilliste]]'' paintings of early 1916;&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; in which Gris brought into practice [[Divisionism|Divisionist]] theory via the incorporation of colored dots into his Cubist pictures.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; This timescale corresponds with the period after which Gris signed a contract with Léonce Rosenberg, following a rally of support by [[Henri Laurens]], Lipchitz and Metzinger.&lt;ref name="Derouet, 1996"&gt;[http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rvart_0035-1326_1996_num_113_1_348280 Christian Derouet, ''Le cubisme "bleu horizon" ou le prix de la guerre.

"Here is the man who has meditated on everything modern", writes [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] in his 1913 publication ''[[The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations]]'', "here is the painter who paints to conceive only new structures, whose aim is to draw or paint nothing but materially pure forms". Apollinaire compares the work of Gris with the "scientific cubism" of Picasso... "Juan Gris is content with purity, scientifically conceived. The conceptions of Juan Gris are always pure, and from this purity parallels are sure to spring".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&amp;pg=PA220 Herschel Browning Chipp, Peter Selz, ''Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics'', University of California Press, 1968, pp. 221-248], {{ISBN|0-520-01450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2"&gt;[http://modjourn.org/render.php?id=1299783137937502&amp;view=mjp_object The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Vol. 9, No. 2: Miscellany Number, Anderson, Margaret C. (editor), New York, 1922-12, Winter 1922, pp. 49-60]&lt;/ref&gt; And spring they did. In 1916, drawing from black and white postcards representing works by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Diego Velázquez|Velázquez]] and [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], Gris created a series of classical (traditionalist) Cubist figure paintings, employing a purified range of pictorial and structural features. These works set the tone for his quest of an ideal unity for the next five years.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

"These themes of pictorial architecture and the "constants" of tradition were consolidated and integrated", writes Green ''et al''; "The inference was there to be drawn: to restore tradition was to restore not only an old subject-matter in new terms, but to find the unchanging principles of structure in painting. Cohesion in space (composition) and cohesion in time (Corot ''in'' Gris) were presented as a single, fundamental truth".&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; Gris himself stressed the relativity and ephemerality of "truth" in his paintings (as a function of him) as in the world itself (as a function of society, culture and time); always susceptible to change.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

From 1915 to late 1916, Gris transited through three different styles of Cubism, writes Green: "starting with a solid extrapolation of the structures and materials of objects, moving into the placement of brilliant coloured dots drifting across flat signs for still-life objects, and culminating in a flattened 'chiaroscoro' realised in planar contrasts of a monochromatic palette".&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

Gris's works from late 1916 through 1917, more so than before, exhibit a simplification of geometric structure, a blurring of the distinction between objects and setting, between subject matter and background. The oblique overlapping planar constructions, tending away from equilibrium, can best be seen in the artists ''Woman with Mandolin, after Corot'' (September 1916) and in its epilogue ''Portrait of Josette Gris'' (October 1916).&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

The clear-cut underlying geometric framework of these works seemingly control the finer elements of the compositions; the constituent components, including the small planes of the faces, become part of the unified whole. Though Gris certainly had planned the representation of his chosen subject matter, the abstract armature serves as the starting point. The geometric structure of Juan Gris's Crystal period is already palpable in ''Still Life before an Open Window, Place Ravignan'' (June 1915). The overlapping elemental planar structure of the composition serves as a foundation to flatten the individual elements onto a unifying surface, foretelling the shape of things to come. In 1919 and particularly 1920, artists and critics began to write conspicuously about this 'synthetic' approach, and asserting its importance in the overall scheme of advanced Cubism.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

In April 1919, following exhibitions by Laurens, Metzinger, Léger and Braque, Gris present nearly fifty works at Rosenberg's Galerie de l'Effort moderne.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; This first [[Solo show (art exhibition)|solo exhibition]] by Gris&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_artista/248 Juan Gris, Biography and Works, Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/1076 Juan Gris, Collection Online, Solomon R.

Gris claimed to manipulate flat abstract planar surfaces first, and only in subsequent stages of his painting process would he 'qualify' them so that the subject-matter became readable. He worked 'deductively' on the global concept first, then consecrated on the perceptive details. Gris referred to this technique as 'synthetic', in contradistinction from the process of 'analysis' intrinsic to his earlier works.&lt;ref name="Gris, MoMA" /&gt;

Gris's open window series of 1921-22 appears to be a response to Picasso's open windows of 1919, painted in St. Raphael.&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; By May 1927, the date of his death, Gris had been considered ''the'' leader of the second phase of Cubism (the Crystal period).&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt;

===Picasso===
While Metzinger and Gris were painting in advanced geometric form during the second phase of Cubism,  Picasso worked on several projects simultaneously. Between 1915 and 1917, he began a series of paintings depicting highly geometric and minimalist Cubist objects, consisting of either a pipe, a guitar or a glass, with an occasional element of collage. "Hard-edged square-cut diamonds", notes art historian John Richardson, "these gems do not always have upside or downside".&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=AxcsQXDHd7YC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=%22crystal+cubism%22,+A+Life+of+Picasso:+The+Triumphant+Years,+1917-1932&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hQhsVb6sG8K8UeuVg8AP&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22crystal%20cubism%22%2C%20A%20Life%20of%20Picasso%3A%20The%20Triumphant%20Years%2C%201917-1932&amp;f=false John Richardson, ''A Life of Picasso: The Triumphant Years, 1917-1932'', Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, Dec 24, 2008, pp. 77-78], {{ISBN|030749649X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Juan Gris to Maurice Raynal, 23 May 1917, Kahnweiler-Gris 1956, 18&lt;/ref&gt; "We need a new name to designate them," wrote Picasso to [[Gertrude Stein]]: Maurice Raynal suggested "Crystal Cubism".&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Morand, 1996, 19 May 1917, p. 143-4&lt;/ref&gt; These "little gems" may have been produced by Picasso in response to critics who had claimed his defection from the movement, through his experimentation with classicism within the so-called [[return to order]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Richardson" /&gt;

===Csaky, Laurens and Lipchitz===
[[File:Joseph Csaky, Deux figures, 1920, relief, limestone, polychrome, 80 cm, Kröller-Müller Museum, Otterlo, Holland.jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Csaky]], ''Deux figures'', 1920, relief, limestone, polychrome, 80&amp;nbsp;cm, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], Otterlo]]
[[Joseph Csaky]] enlisted as a volunteer in the French army in 1914, fighting alongside French soldiers during [[World War I]], and remained for the duration. Returning to Paris in 1918, Csaky began a series of [[Cubist sculpture]]s derived in part from a machine-like aesthetic; streamlined with geometric and mechanical affinities. By this time Csaky's artistic vocabulary had evolved considerably from his pre-war Cubism: it was distinctly mature, showing a new, refined sculptural quality. Few works of early modern sculpture are comparable to the work Csaky produced in the years directly succeeding World War I. These were nonrepresentational freely-standing objects, i.e., abstract three-dimensional constructions combining organic and geometric elements. "Csaky derived from nature forms which were in concordance with his passion for architecture, simple, pure, and psychologically convincing." (Maurice Raynal, 1929)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_0T8LAAAAIAAJ Edith Balas, 1998, ''Joseph Csaky: A Pioneer of Modern Sculpture''], Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholar Edith Balas writes of Csaky's sculpture following the war years:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Csáky, more than anyone else working in sculpture, took Pierre Reverdy's theoretical writings on art and cubist doctrine to heart. "Cubism is an eminently plastic art; but an art of creation, not of reproduction and interpretation." The artist was to take no more than "elements" from the external world, and intuitively arrive at the "idea" of objects made up of what for him constant in value. Objects were not to be analyzed; neither were the experiences they evoked. They were to be re-created in the mind, and thereby purified. By some unexplained miracle the "pure" forms of the mind, an entirely autonomous vocabulary, of (usual geometric) forms, would make contact with the external world." (Balas, 1998, p. 27)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These 1919 works (e.g., ''Cones and Spheres, Abstract Sculpture'', Balas, pp.&amp;nbsp;30–41)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt; are made of juxtaposing sequences of rhythmic geometric forms, where light and shadow, mass and the void, play a key role. Though almost entirely abstract, they allude, occasionally, to the structure of the human body or modern machines, but the semblance functions only as "elements" (Reverdy) and are deprived of descriptive narrative. Csaky's polychrome reliefs of the early 1920s display an affinity with [[Purism (arts)|Purism]]—an extreme form of the Cubism aesthetic developing at the time—in their rigorous economy of architectonic symbols and the use of crystalline geometric structures.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

Csaky's ''Deux figures'', 1920, [[Kröller-Müller Museum]], employs broad planar surfaces accented by descriptive linear elements comparable to Georges Valmier's work of the following year (''Figure'' 1921).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jpdubs.hautetfort.com/archive/2007/04/04/cubisme.html Georges Valmier, ''Figure'', 1921, oil on canvas, 97.1 x 74.9 cm]&lt;/ref&gt; Csaky's influences were drawn more from the [[art of ancient Egypt]] rather than from French [[Neoclassicism]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[File:Jacques Lipchitz, 1918, Le Guitariste (The Guitar Player).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1918, ''Le Guitariste'' (''The Guitar Player'')]]
With this intense flurry of activity, Csaky was taken on by [[Léonce Rosenberg]], and exhibited regularly at the Galerie l'Effort Moderne. By 1920 Rosenberg was the sponsor, dealer and publisher of [[Piet Mondrian]], Léger, Lipchitz and Csaky. He had just published ''Le Néo-Plasticisme''—a collection of writings by Mondrian—and Theo van Doesburg's ''Classique-Baroque-Moderne''. Csaky's showed a series of works at Rosenberg's gallery in December 1920.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

[[File:Jacques Lipchitz, 1918, Still Life, bas relief, stone.jpg|thumb|230px|[[Jacques Lipchitz]], 1918, ''Instruments de musique'' (''Still Life''), bas relief, stone]]
For the following three years, Rosenberg purchased Csaky's entire artistic production. In 1921 Rosenberg organized an exhibit titled ''Les maîtres du Cubisme'', a group show that featured works by Csaky, Gleizes, Metzinger, Mondrian, Gris, Léger, Picasso, Laurens, Braque, Herbin, Severini, Valmier, Ozenfant and Survage.&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

Csaky's works of the early 1920s reflect a distinct form of Crystal Cubism, and were produced in a wide variety of materials, including marble, onyx and rock crystal. They reflect a collective spirit of the time, "a puritanical denial of sensuousness that reduced the cubist vocabulary to rectangles, verticals, horizontals," writes Balas, "a Spartan alliance of discipline and strength" to which Csaky adhered in his ''Tower Figures.'' "In their aesthetic order, lucidity, classical precision, emotional neutrality, and remoteness from visible reality, they should be considered stylistically and historically as belonging to the [[De Stijl|De Stijl movement]]." (Balas, 1998)&lt;ref name="Edith Balas, 1998" /&gt;

[[Jacques Lipchitz]] recounted a meeting during the First World War with the poet and writer close to the [[Abbaye de Créteil]], [[Jules Romains]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I remember in 1915 when I was deeply involved in cubist sculpture but was still in many ways not certain of what I was doing, I had a visit from the writer Jules Romains, and he asked me what I was trying to do. I answered, "I would like to make an art as pure as a crystal." And he answered in a slightly mocking way, "What do you know about crystals?" At first I was upset by this remark and his attitude, but then, as I began to think about it, I realized that I knew nothing about crystals except that they were a form of inorganic life and that this was not what I wanted to make.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/pubs/bulletins/1/pdf/3258970.pdf.bannered.pdf ''Jacques Lipchitz, his life in sculpture'', The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, New Series, Vol. 30, No. 6 (Jun. - Jul., 1972), published by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, p. 285] (PDF)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Both Lipchitz and [[Henri Laurens]]—late adherents to Cubist sculpture, following [[Alexander Archipenko]], [[Joseph Csaky]], [[Umberto Boccioni]], [[Otto Gutfreund]] and Picasso—began production in late 1914, and 1915 (respectively), taking Cubist paintings of 1913-14 as a starting point.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up Douglas Cooper, "The Cubist Epoch"], Phaidon Press Limited, 1970, in association with the [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Lipchitz and Laurens retained highly figurative and legible components in their works leading up to 1915-16, after which naturalist and descriptive elements were muted, dominated by a synthetic style of Cubism under the influence of Picasso and Gris.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

Between 1916 and 1918 Lipchitz and Laurens developed a breed of advanced wartime Cubism (primarily in sculpture) that represented a process of purification. With observed reality no longer the basis for the depiction of subject, model or motif, Lipchitz and Laurens created works that excluded any starting point, based predominantly on the imagination, and continued to do so during the transition from war to peace.&lt;ref name="Cooper" /&gt;

In December 1918 Laurens, a close friend of both Picasso and Braque, inaugurated the series of Cubist exhibitions at L'Effort Moderne (Lipchitz showed in 1920), by which time his works had wholly approached the Cubist ''[[Return to order|retour à l'ordre]]''. Rather than descriptive, these works were rooted in geometric abstraction; a species of architectural, polychromed multimedia Cubist constructions.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

==Criticism==
[[File:Pablo Picasso, reproduced in L'Elan, Number 9, 12 February 1916.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, ''Femme assise dans un fauteuil'' (''Woman sitting in an armchair''), reproduced in ''L'Elan'', Number 9, 12 February 1916]]
From its first public exhibition in 1911, art critic [[Louis Vauxcelles]] had voiced his contempt for Cubism. In June 1918, Vauxcelles, writing under the pseudonym Pinturrichio, continued his attack:&lt;ref name="Vauxcelles"&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k6544512p/f11.image Louis Vauxcelles (Pinturrichio), Le Carnet des ateliers, ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'', 9 June 1918, p. 9]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Integral Cubism is crumbling, vanishing, evaporating. Defections, every day, reach the headquarters of pure painting. Soon Metzinger will be the last of his species, representative of an abandoned doctrine. "And if one shall remain, he'll whisper painfully, I'll be the one". (Vauxcelles, 1918)&lt;ref name="Vauxcelles" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following month, Vauxcelles forecast the final demise of Cubism by the fall of 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Vauxcelles (Pinturrichio), De Profundis, ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'', 28 July 1918, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall came the end of the war, and in December, a series of exhibitions at Galerie l'Effort Moderne of Cubist works demonstrated that Cubism was still alive.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Defections by [[Diego Rivera]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|André Favory|fr}} from the Cubist circle, cited by Pinturrichio, proved to be insufficient grounds upon which to base his prediction. Vauxcelles even went as far as organizing a small exhibition at the galerie Blot (late 1918) of artists that appeared to be anti-Cubist; Lhote, Rivera and Favory among them. Allies in Vauxcelles ongoing battle against Cubism included Jean-Gabriel Lemoine (''L'Intransigeant''), Roland Chavenon (''L'Information''), [[Gustave Kahn]] (''L'Heure''), and Waldemar George ({{Interlanguage link multi|Jerzy Waldemar Jarocinski|fr}}), who would soon become one of the leading post-war supporters of Cubism.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Inversely, once a steadfast supporter of Cubism, [[André Salmon]] in 1917-18 predicted too its demise; claiming it to have been merely a phase leading to a new art-form more closely attuned with nature. Two more former advocates of Cubism had also defected, {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Allard|fr}} and [[Blaise Cendrars]], joining the ranks of Vauxcelles in frontline attacks on Cubism. Allard reproached the visible distancing of Cubism from the dynamism and diversity of lived experience toward a universe of purified objects. Similarly, Cendrars wrote in an article published May 1919 "The formulae of the Cubists' are becoming too narrow, and can no longer embrace the personality of the painters".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blaise Cendrars, ''Modernités, I, Quelle sera la nouvelle peinture?'', La Rose Rouge, 3 May 1919. Reproduced in Aujourd'hui, Paris 1931, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counter attacks===

The poet and theorist [[Pierre Reverdy]] had surpassed all rivals in his attacks on the anti-Cubist campaign between 1918 and 1919. He had been in close contact with the Cubists prior to the war, and in 1917 joined forces with two other poets who shared his points of view: [[Paul Dermée]] and [[Vicente Huidobro]]. In March of the same year Reverdy edited ''Nord-Sud''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/title.html?titleURN=urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnaaw Pierre Reverdy, ''Nord-Sud''], Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the magazine was inspired by the [[Paris Métro]] line that extended from Montmartre to Montparnasse, linking these two focal points of artistic creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Breton]], ''Œuvres complètes No. 1'', Gallimard, La Pléiade, 1988, note 3, p. 1075&lt;/ref&gt; Reverdy began this project towards the end of 1916, with an art world still under the pressures of war, to show the parallels between the poetic theories of [[Guillaume Apollinaire]] of [[Max Jacob]] and himself in marking the burgeoning of a new era for poetry and artistic reflection. In ''Nord-Sud'' Reverdy, with the help of Dermée and [[Georges Braque]], exposed his literary theories, and outlined a coherent theoretical stance on the latest developments in Cubism.&lt;ref&gt;Étienne-Alain Hubert, note au tome 1 des ''Œuvres complètes'' de Pierre Reverdy, [[Groupe Flammarion|Flammarion]], page 1298&lt;/ref&gt; His treatise ''On Cubism'', published in the first issue of ''Nord-Sud'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaw19170315-01&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- Pierre Reverdy, ''Sur le Cubisme'', Nord-Sud, Volume 1, Number 1, 15 March 1917, pp. 5-7], Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; did so perhaps most influentially.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reverdy"&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaw191810-01.2.5&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN-------# Pierre Reverdy, ''Arts'', Nord-Sud, Volume 2, Number 16, October 1918, p. 4], Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt; With his characteristic preference for offense rather than defense, Reverdy launched an attack against Vauxcelles' anti-Cubist crusade:

&lt;blockquote&gt;How many times has it been said that the art movement called Cubism is extinguished? Each time that a purge occurs the critics of the other side, who ask only that their desires be taken as facts, shout defection and howl for its death. This is nothing basically but a ruse, because Pinturrichichio [''sic''], of the ''Carnet de la Semaine'' and the others know very well that the serious artists of this group are extremely happy to see go... those opportunists who have taken over creations the significance of which they do not even comprehend, and were attracted only by the love of buzz and personal interest. It was predictable that these unrecommendable and compromising people would renounce their endeavors sooner or later. (Reverdy, 1918)&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Reverdy" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Pablo Picasso, reproduced in L'Elan, Number 10, 1 December 1916.jpg|thumb|Pablo Picasso, reproduced in ''L'Elan'', Number 10, 1 December 1916]]
Another vigorous supporter of Cubism was the art dealer and collector [[Léonce Rosenberg]]. By the end of 1918—filling in the vacuum left in the wake of [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler|D.-H. Kahnweiler]]'s imposed exile—Rosenberg purchased works by almost all of the Cubists. His defense of Cubism would prove to be longer-lasting and wider-ranging than Reverdy's. His first tactical maneuver was to address a letter to ''Le Carnet de la Semaine'' denying the chimerical claim made by Vauxcelles that both Picasso and Gris had defected. Much more poignant and difficult to combat, however, was his second tactical maneuver: a succession of prominent Cubist exhibitions held at the [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]], in Rosenber's [[Hôtel particulier]], 19, rue de la Baume, located in the elegant and stylishly fashionable [[8th arrondissement of Paris]].&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

This series of large exhibitions—including works created between 1914 and 1918 by almost all the major Cubists—began 18 December with Cubist sculptures by Henri Laurens, followed in January 1919 with an exhibition of Cubist paintings by Jean Metzinger, Fernand Léger in February, Georges Braque in March, Juan Gris April, Gino Severini May, and Pablo Picasso in June, marking the climax of the campaign. This well-orchestrated program showed that Cubism was still very much alive,&lt;ref name="Gris" /&gt; and it would remain so for at least a half-decade. Missing from this sequence of exhibitions were Jacques Lipchitz (who would exhibit in 1920), and those who had left France during the Great War: Robert Delaunay and Albert Gleizes most obviously. Nonetheless, according to Christopher Green, "this was an astonishingly complete demonstration that Cubism had not only continued between 1914 and 1917, having survived the war, but was still developing in 1918 and 1919 in its "new collective form" marked by "intellectual rigor". In the face of such a display of vigour, it really was difficult to maintain convincingly that Cubism was even close to extinction".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Further evidence to bolster the prediction made by Vauxcelles could have been found in a small exhibition at the Galerie Thomas (in a space owned by a sister of [[Paul Poiret]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Germaine Bongard|fr}}). ''The first exhibition of [[Purism|Purist]] Art'' opened on 21 December 1918, with works by [[Amédée Ozenfant]] and [[Le Corbusier|Charles-Édouard Jeanneret]] (later called Le Corbusier), who claimed to be successors of pre-war Cubism.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theeuropeanlibrary.org/tel4/newspapers/issue/L'Intransigeant/1921/1/31 ''L'Intransigeant'', 31 January 1921, p. 2, National Library of France]&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of a Purist manifesto in book-form had been published to coincided with the exhibition, titled ''Après le cubisme'' (After Cubism):&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/corbuweb/morpheus.aspx?sysId=13&amp;IrisObjectId=6448&amp;sysLanguage=en-en&amp;itemPos=3&amp;itemSort=en-en_sort_string1%20&amp;itemCount=47&amp;sysParentName=&amp;sysParentId=25 Amédée Ozenfant, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, ''Après le cubisme'', Éditions des Commentaires, Paris, 1918]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ozenfant and Jeanneret felt that Cubism had become too decorative,&lt;ref name="Speiser"&gt;[http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/CorbuCache/2049_2489.pdf Philip Speiser, ''Villa La Rocca'', Fondation Le Corbusier, September 2009, p. 10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303193059/http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/CorbuCache/2049_2489.pdf |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; practiced by so many individuals that it lacked unity, it had become too fashionable. Their clarity of subject matter (more figurative, less abstract than the Cubists) had been welcomed by members of the anti-Cubist camp. They showed works that were a direct result of observation; perspectival space only slightly distorted. Ozenfant and Jeanneret, like Lhote, remained faithful to the Cubist idiom that form should not be abandoned. Some of the works exhibited related directly to the Cubism practiced during the war (such as Ozenfant's ''Bottle, Pipe and Books'', 1918), with flatted planar structures and varying degrees of multiple perspective.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

For Ozenfant and Jeanneret only Crystal Cubism had conserved the geometric rigor of the early Cubist revolution.&lt;ref name="Speiser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lapeinturemodern00ozenuoft Amédée Ozenfant, Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, ''La peinture moderne'', Éditions G. Crès et Cie, 1925]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915, in collaboration with [[Max Jacob]] and [[Guillaume Apollinaire]], Ozenfant founded the magazine ''L'Élan'', which he edited until late 1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/title.html?titleURN=urn:PUL:bluemountain:bmtnaaf ''L'élan'', Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://modernist-magazines.org/?q=category/categories/lelan Michelle Parker, ''L'Élan and Amédée Ozenfant: Art for Art's Sake?'', DH and Literary Studies, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artists/bios/571 Amédée Ozenfant, Solomon R. Guggenheim Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 he met Jeanneret, with whom he would join forces between 1918 and 1925 on a venture called [[Purism]]: a variation of Cubism in both painting and architecture.&lt;ref name="Ozenfant and Purism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Susan|title=Ozenfant and Purism: The Evolution of a style 1915–1930|year=1981|publisher=UMI Research Press|location=Ann Arbor, Michigan|pages=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with the pro-Cubist writer, poet, and critique [[Paul Dermée]], Ozenfant and Jeanneret founded the avant-garde journal ''L'Esprit Nouveau'', published from 1920 to 1925. In the last issue, Jeanneret, under the pseudonym Paul Boulard, writes of how the laws of nature were manifested in the shape of crystals; the properties of which were hermetically coherent, both interiorly and exteriorly. In ''La peinture moderne'', under the title ''Vers le crystal'', Ozenfant and Jeanneret liken the properties of crystals with the true Cubist, whose œuvre tends toward the crystal.&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=8qy52T7AJfUC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=%22Toward+the+crystal%22,+Ozenfant+and+Jeanneret&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=w1KaVAijYh&amp;sig=XRCGCRUSYeWbnBJprAJ5lTONEQM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3YBqVeLJEYzZU8-RgcgP&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=crystal&amp;f=false Jan de Heer, ''The Architectonic Colour: Polychromy in the Purist Architecture of Le Corbusier'' 010 Publishers, 2009, p. 139], {{ISBN|906450671X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Certain Cubists have created paintings that can be said to tend toward the perfection of the crystal. These works seem to approach our current needs. The crystal is, in nature, a phenomenon that affects us most because it clearly shows the path to geometric organization. Nature sometimes shows us how forms are built through a reciprocal interplay of internal and external forces... following the theoretical forms of geometry; and man delights in these arrangements because he finds in them justification for his abstract conceptions of geometry: the spirit of man and nature find a factor of common ground, in the crystal... In true Cubism, there something organic that proceeds from the inside to the outside... The universality of the work depends on its plastic purity. (Ozenfant and Jeanneret, 1923-25)&lt;ref name="Speiser" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A second Purist exhibition was held at the Galerie Druet, Paris, in 1921. In 1924 Ozenfant opened a free studio in Paris with [[Fernand Léger]], where he taught with [[Aleksandra Ekster]] and [[Marie Laurencin]].&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;Judi Freeman, "Ozenfant, Amédée", Grove Art Online. Retrieved 26 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ozenfant and Le Corbusier wrote ''La Peinture moderne'' in 1925.&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne" /&gt;

In final issue of ''L'élan'', published December 1916, Ozenfant writes: "Le Cubisme est un movement de purism'' (Cubism is a movement of purism).&lt;ref&gt;[http://bluemountain.princeton.edu/bluemtn/cgi-bin/bluemtn?a=d&amp;d=bmtnaaf19161201-01&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN----- Amédée Ozenfant, ''Notes sur le cubisme'', L'élan, Number 10, 1 December 1916, p. 3]. Blue Mountain Project, Princeton University Library&lt;/ref&gt;

And in ''La peinture moderne'', 1923-25, with Cubism visibly still alive and in highly crystalline form, Ozenfant and Jeanneret write:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We see the real cubists continue their work, imperturbable; they are also seen to continue their influence on spirits... They will arrive more or less strongly depending on the oscillations of their nature, their tenacity or their concessions and analysis [''tâtonnement''] that are characteristic of artistic creation, to search for a state of clarification, condensation, firmness, intensity, synthesis; they will arrive at a true virtuosity of the game of shapes and colors, as well as a highly developed science of the composition. Overall and despite the personal coefficients, one can discern a tendency towards what might be imaged in saying: ''tendency toward the crystal''.&lt;ref name="La peinture moderne" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Crystal Cubists embraced the stability of everyday life, the enduring and the pure, but too the classical, with all that it signified respecting art and ideal. Order and clarity, right to the core of its Latin roots, was a dominant factor within the circle of Rosenberg's L'Effort moderne. While Lhote, Rivera, Ozenfant and Le Corbusier attempted to attain a compromise between the abstract and nature in their search for another Cubism, all of the Cubists shared common goals. The first, writes Green: "that art should not be concerned with the description of nature... The rejection of [[Realism (arts)|Naturalism]] was intimately bound up with the second basic principle shared by them all: that the work of art, being not an interpretation of anything else, was something in its own right with its own laws". These same sentiments observable from the outset of Cubism were now essential and prevailing to an extent never before seen. There was a third principle that followed from the former that came to light during the Crystal period, again according to Green: "the principle that nature should be approached as no more than the supplier of 'elements' to be pictorially or sculpturally developed and then freely manipulated according to the laws of the medium alone".&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

[[Albert Gleizes]] had been in New York, Bermuda and Barcelona following a short stint serving the military at the fortress city of Toul, late 1914 early 1915.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt; His arrival in Paris after his self-imposed exile saw the new style already underway.

Gleizes' mobilization was not a major obstacle to his production of artwork, though, working primarily on small scale, he did produce one relatively large piece: ''Portrait of an Army Doctor''.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001"&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=QG9wNyIlEAgC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=gleizes,+%22simultaneous+movements+of+translation%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8EIKQ9bxba&amp;sig=Ddnuo643ki8Urc433IuNhY4KzwE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9XovVdD_Gor-ygPcioGIBA&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=gleizes%2C%20%22simultaneous%20movements%20of%20translation%22&amp;f=false Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', Yale University Press, 2001], {{ISBN|0300089643}}&lt;/ref&gt; An admirer of his work, his commanding officer—the regimental surgeon portrayed by Gleizes in this painting—made arrangements so that Gleizes could continue to paint while mobilized at Toul.&lt;ref name="Gleizes, Guggenheim"&gt;[http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/collections/collection-online/artwork/1445 Albert Gleizes, ''Portrait of an Army Doctor'', Solomon R.

He had now undertaken a path that lead to 'synthesis', with its starting point in 'unity'.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Souvenirs: le Cubisme, 1908-1914'', ''La guerre'', Cahiers Albert Gleizes, Association des Amis d'Albert Gleizes, Lyon, 1957, p. 15.

This unity, and the highly crystalline geometricized materialization consisting of superimposed constituent planes of Crystal Cubism would ultimately be described by Gleizes, in ''La Peinture et ses lois'' (1922–23), as 'simultaneous movements of translation and rotation of the plane'.&lt;ref name="Peter Brooke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt; The synthetic factor was ultimately taken furthest of all from within the Cubists by Gleizes.&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

Gleizes believed that the Crystal Cubists—specifically Metzinger and Gris—had found the principles on which an essentially non-representational art could be built. He felt that the earlier abstract works of artists such as [[František Kupka]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Henry Valensi|fr}}, lacked a solid foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.francisboutle.co.uk/pages.php?cID=9&amp;pID=51 ''July 09: Futurism at the Tate Modern: a review by Peter Brooke'', ''From Cubism to Classicism, Painting and its Laws'', From Cubism to Classicism by Gino Severini / Painting and its laws by Albert Gleizes, Francis Boutle, 2001], {{ISBN|1903427053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1920 publication, ''Du Cubisme et les moyens de le comprendre'', Gleizes explained that Cubism was now at a stage of  development in which fundamental principles could be deduced from particular facts, applicable to a defined class of phenomena, drawn and taught to students. These basic theoretical postulates could be as productive for future developments of the fine arts as the mathematically based principles of [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] had been since the [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/ Peter Brooke, ''Victor Poznanski and the exhibition L'art d'aujourd'hui, 1925'', ''Gleizes - ups and downs of Cubism'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Painting and its Laws''===
[[Albert Gleizes]] undertook the task of writing the characterizations of these principles in ''Painting and its Laws'' (''La Peinture et ses lois''), published by gallery owner Jacques Povolozky in the journal ''La Vie des lettres et des arts'', 1922-3, and as a book in 1924.&lt;ref name="Brooke, 2001" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org/form-and-history/poznanski/painting-and-its-laws.html Albert Gleizes, ''Painting and Its Laws'', summary by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alibert"&gt;Pierre Alibert, ''Gleizes, Naissance et avenire du cubisme'', Aubin-Visconti, Edition Dumas, Saint-Etienne, October 1982, {{ISBN|2-85529-000-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''La Peinture et ses lois'' Gleizes deduces the fundamental laws of painting from the picture plane, its proportions, the movement of the human eye and the physical laws. This theory, subsequently referred to as ''translation-rotation'', "ranks with the writings of Mondrian and Malevich", writes art historian [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "as one of the most thorough expositions of the principles of abstract art, which in his case entailed the rejection not only of representation but also of geometric forms".&lt;ref name="Gleizes, MoMA" /&gt;

One of Gleizes's primary objectives was to answer the questions: How will the planar surface be animated, and by what logical method, independent of the artists ''fantaisie'', can it be attained?&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois"&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''La Peinture et ses lois, Ce qui devait sortir du cubisme'', La Vie des lettres et des arts, 1922-3, 1924 in book form&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes, Action, Cahiers Individualistes de philosophie et d'art, Volume 1, No. 1, February 1920.jpg|thumb|[[Albert Gleizes]], front cover of ''Action, Cahiers Individualistes de philosophie et d'art'', Volume 1, No. 1, February 1920]]
'''The approach:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Gleizes bases these laws both on truisms inherent throughout the history of art, and especially on his own experience since 1912, such as: "The primary goal of art has never been exterior imitation" (p.&amp;nbsp;31); "Artworks come from emotion... the product of individual sensibility and taste" (p.&amp;nbsp;42); "The artist is always in a state of emotion, sentimental exaltation [ivresse]" (p.&amp;nbsp;43); "The painting in which the idea of abstract creation is realized is no longer an anecdote, but a concrete fact" (p.&amp;nbsp;56); "Creating a painted artwork is not the emission of an opinion" (p.&amp;nbsp;59); "The plastic dynamism will be born out of rhythmic relations between objects... establishing novel plastic liaisons between purely objective elements that compose the painting" (p.&amp;nbsp;22).&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albert Gleizes, ''Le Cubisme et la Tradition'', Montjoie, Paris, 10 February 1913, p. 4. Reprinted as ''A Propos du Salon d'Automne'', in ''Tradition et Cubisme'', Paris, 1927. Gleizes outlines what he perceives as the 'decadence' inherent in the modern art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing, Gleizes states that the 'reality' of a painting is not that of a mirror, but of the object... issue of imminent logic (p.&amp;nbsp;62). "The subject-pretext tending toward numeration, inscribed following the nature of the plane, attains a tangent intersections between known images of the natural world and unknown images that reside within intuition" (p.&amp;nbsp;63).&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''Defining the laws:'''&lt;br /&gt;
Rhythm and space are for Gleizes the two vital conditions. Rhythm is a consequence of the continuity of certain phenomena, variable or invariable, following from mathematical relations. Space is a conception of the human psyche that follows from quantitative comparisons (pp.&amp;nbsp;35, 38, 51). This mechanism  is the foundation for artistic expression. It is therefor both a philosophical and scientific synthesis. For Gleizes, Cubism was a means to arrive not only at a new mode of expression but above all a new way of thinking. This was, according to art historian {{Interlanguage link multi|Pierre Alibert (art historian)|fr|Pierre Alibert|lt=Pierre Alibert}}, the foundation of both a new species of painting and an alternative relationship with the world; hence another principle of civilization.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

The problem set out by Gleizes was to replace ''anecdote'' as a starting point for the work of art, by the sole means of using the elements of the painting itself: line, form and color.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

Beginning with a central rectangle, taken as an example of elementary form, Gleizes points out two mechanical ways of juxtaposing form to create a painting: (1) either by reproducing the initial form (employing various [[Symmetry (geometry)|symmetries]] such as reflectional, rotational or translational), or by modifying (or not) its dimensions.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt; (2) By displacement of the initial form; pivoting around an imaginary axis in one direction or another.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

The choice of position (through translation and/or rotation), though based on the inspiration of the artist, is no longer attributed to the anecdotal. An objective and rigorous method, independent of the painter, replaces emotion or sensibility in the determination the placement of form, that is through ''translation'' and ''rotation''.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

'''Schematic illustrations:'''&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:Albert Gleizes (after) 1. Mouvements de translation du plan sur un côté.jpg|thumb|center|500px||&lt;div align="center"&gt;1. Movements of translation of the plane to one side&lt;/div&gt;]]

Space and rhythm, according to Gleizes, are perceptible by the extent of movement (displacement) of planar surfaces. These elemental transformations modify the position and importance of the initial plane, whether they converge or diverge ('recede' or 'advance') from the eye, creating a series of new and separate spatial planes appreciable physiologically by the observer.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

Another movement is added to the first movement of translation of the plane to one side: Rotation of the plane. Fig. I shows the resulting formation that follows from simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the initial plane produced on the axis. Fig II and Fig. III represent the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle, inclined to the right and to the left. The axis point at which movement is realized is established by the observer. Fig. IV represents the simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the rectangle plane, with the position of the eye of the observed displaced left of the axis. Displacement toward the right (though not represented) is straightforward enough to imagine.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

Simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane resulting in the creation of a spatial and rhythmic plastic organism&lt;/div&gt;]]

With these figures Gleizes attempts to present, under the most simple conditions possible (simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane), the creation of a spatial and rhythmic organism (Fig. VIII), with practically no initiative taken on the part of the artist who controls the evolutionary process. The planar surfaces of Fig. VIII are filled with hatching espousing the 'direction' of the planes. What emerges in the inert plane, according to Gleizes, through the movement followed by the eye of the observer, is "a visible imprint of successive stages of which the initial rhythmic cadence coordinated a succession of differing states". These successive stages permit the perception of space. The initial state, by consequence of the transformation, has become a spatial and rhythmic organism.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

Plastic spatial and rhythmic system obtained by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side&lt;/div&gt;]]

Fig. I and Fig. II obtain mechanically, Gleizes writes, with minimal personal initiative, a "plastic spatial and rhythmic system", by the conjugation of simultaneous movements of rotation and translation of the plane and from the movements of translation of the plane to one side. The result is a spatial and rhythmic organism more ''complex'' than shown in Fig. VIII; demonstrating through mechanical, purely plastic means, the realization of a material universe independent of intentional intervention by the artist. This is sufficient to demonstrate, according to Gleizes, the ''possibilities of the plane'' to serve spatially and rhythmically by its own power.&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt; [''L'exposé hâtif de cette mécanique purement plastique aboutissant à la réalisation d'un univers matériel en dehors de l'intervention particulière intentionnelle, suffit à démontrer la ''possibilité du plan'' de signifier spatialement et rythmiquement par sa seule puissance''].&lt;ref name="Alibert" /&gt;&lt;ref name="La Peinture et ses lois" /&gt;

Throughout the war, to [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] and the series of exhibitions at [[Léonce Rosenberg#Galerie de L'Effort Moderne|Galerie de L'Effort Moderne]] that followed, the rift between art and life—and the overt distillation that came with it—had become the canon of Cubist orthodoxy; and it would persist despite its antagonists through the 1920s:&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Order remained the keynote as post-war reconstruction commenced. It is not surprising, therefore, to find a continuity in the development of Cubist art as the transition was made from war to peace, an unbroken commitment to the Latin virtues along with an unbroken commitment to the aesthetically pure. The new Cubism that emerged, the Cubism of Picasso, Laurens, Gris, Metzinger and Lipchitz most obviously of all, has come to be known as "crystal Cubism". It was indeed the end-product of a progressive closing down of possibilities in the name of a "call to order". (Christopher Green, 1987, p. 37)&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inside Modernism" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More so than the pre-war Cubist period, the Crystal Cubist period has been described by Green as the most important in the history of [[Modernism]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In terms of a Modernist will to aesthetic isolation and of the broad theme of the separation of culture and society, it is actually Cubism ''after'' 1914 that emerges as most important to the history of Modernism, and especially... Cubism between around 1916 and around 1924... Only after 1914 did Cubism come almost exclusively to be identified with a single-minded insistence on the isolation of the art-object in a special category with its own laws and its own experience to offer, a category considered above life. It is Cubism in this later period that has most to tell anyone concerned with the problems of Modernism and post-modernism now, because it was only then that issues emerged with real clarity in and around Cubism which are closely comparable with those that emerged in and around Anglo-American Modernism in the sixties and after. (Green, 1987, Introduction, p. 1)&lt;ref name="Green, 1987" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Art historian Peter Brooke has commented on Crystal Cubism, and more generally on the Salon Cubists: 
:"A general history of Salon Cubism, however, still needs to be written, a history that could be extended to include the wonderful collective phenomenon which Christopher Green has called 'Crystal Cubism' — the highly structured work of the Cubist painters... who remained in Paris during the war, most notably Metzinger and Gris. An opening up of this early Cubism in all its intellectual fullness would... reveal it as being not only the most radical movement in painting of the past century but, still, the most rich in possibilities for the future". (Peter Brooke, 2000)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=QG9wNyIlEAgC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=peter+brooke,+%22%27crystal+Cubism%27%22&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=P_hBVc3-JMHiaJTVgIgN&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=peter%20brooke%2C%20%22'crystal%20Cubism'%22&amp;f=false Peter Brooke, ''Albert Gleizes: For and Against the Twentieth Century'', Introduction, p. xi, Yale University Press, 2001], {{ISBN|0300089643}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Data mining'''  is the process of discovering patterns in large [[data set]]s involving methods at the intersection of [[machine learning]], [[statistics]], and [[database system]]s.&lt;ref name="acm" /&gt; Data mining is an [[interdisciplinary]] subfield of [[computer science]] with an overall goal to extract information (with intelligent methods) from a data set and transform the information into a comprehensible structure for further use.&lt;ref name="acm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kdd.org/curriculum/index.html |title=Data Mining Curriculum |publisher=[[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[SIGKDD]] |date=2006-04-30 |accessdate=2014-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brittanica"&gt;{{cite web |last=Clifton |first=Christopher |title=Encyclopædia Britannica: Definition of Data Mining |year=2010 |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1056150/data-mining |accessdate=2010-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="elements"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hastie|first1=Trevor|authorlink1=Trevor Hastie|last2=Tibshirani|first2=Robert|authorlink2=Robert Tibshirani|last3=Friedman|first3=Jerome|authorlink3=Jerome H.

The term "data mining" is in fact a [[misnomer]], because the goal is the extraction of patterns and knowledge from large amounts of data, not the extraction (''mining'') of data itself.&lt;ref name="han-kamber"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jiawei |last1=Han |authorlink1=Jiawei Han |first2=Micheline |last2=Kamber |date=2001 |title=Data mining: concepts and techniques |publisher=[[Morgan Kaufmann]] |page=5 |isbn=978-1-55860-489-6 |quote=Thus, data mining should have been more appropriately named "knowledge mining from data," which is unfortunately somewhat long}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also is a [[buzzword]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.okairp.org/documents/2005%20Fall/F05_ROMEDataQualityETC.pdf OKAIRP 2005 Fall Conference, Arizona State University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201170452/http://www.okairp.org/documents/2005%20Fall/F05_ROMEDataQualityETC.pdf |date=2014-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently applied to any form of large-scale data or [[information processing]] ([[Data collection|collection]], [[information extraction|extraction]], [[Data warehouse|warehousing]], [[data analysis|analysis]], and statistics) as well as any application of [[Decision support system|computer decision support system]], including [[artificial intelligence]] (e.g., machine learning) and [[business intelligence]].

The term "data mining" was [added] primarily for marketing reasons. |postscript={{inconsistent citations}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the more general terms (''large scale'') ''[[data analysis]]'' and ''[[analytics]]'' – or, when referring to actual methods, ''artificial intelligence'' and ''machine learning'' – are more appropriate.

The actual data mining task is the semi-automatic or automatic analysis of large quantities of data to extract previously unknown, interesting patterns such as groups of data records ([[cluster analysis]]), unusual records ([[anomaly detection]]), and dependencies ([[association rule mining]], [[sequential pattern mining]]). This usually involves using database techniques such as [[spatial index|spatial indices]]. These patterns can then be seen as a kind of summary of the input data, and may be used in further analysis or, for example, in machine learning and [[predictive analytics]]. For example, the data mining step might identify multiple groups in the data, which can then be used to obtain more accurate prediction results by a [[decision support system]]. Neither the data collection, data preparation, nor result interpretation and reporting is part of the data mining step, but do belong to the overall KDD process as additional steps.

The related terms ''[[data dredging]]'', ''data fishing'', and ''data snooping'' refer to the use of data mining methods to sample parts of a larger population data set that are (or may be) too small for reliable statistical inferences to be made about the validity of any patterns discovered. These methods can, however, be used in creating new hypotheses to test against the larger data populations.

==Etymology==
In the 1960s, statisticians and economists used terms like ''data fishing'' or ''data dredging'' to refer to what they considered the bad practice of analyzing data without an a-priori hypothesis. The term "data mining" was used in a similarly critical way by economist [[Michael Lovell]] in an article published in the [[Review of Economic Studies]] 1983. Lovell indicates that the practice "masquerades under a variety of aliases, ranging from "experimentation" (positive) to "fishing" or "snooping" (negative).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lovell|first=Michael C.|date=1983|title=Data Mining|journal=The Review of Economics and Statistics|volume=65|issue=1|pages=1–12|doi=10.2307/1924403|jstor=1924403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''data mining'' appeared around 1990 in the database community, generally with positive connotations. For a short time in 1980s, a phrase "database mining"™, was used, but since it was trademarked by HNC, a San Diego-based company, to pitch their Database Mining Workstation;&lt;ref name="Mena"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mena |first=Jesús |year=2011 |title=Machine Learning Forensics for Law Enforcement, Security, and Intelligence |location=Boca Raton, FL |publisher=CRC Press (Taylor &amp; Francis Group) |isbn=978-1-4398-6069-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers consequently turned to ''data mining''. Other terms used include ''data archaeology'', ''information harvesting'', ''information discovery'', ''knowledge extraction'', etc. [[Gregory I. Piatetsky-Shapiro|Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] coined the term "knowledge discovery in databases" for the first workshop on the same topic [http://www.kdnuggets.com/meetings/kdd89/ (KDD-1989)] and this term became more popular in [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] and [[machine learning]] community. However, the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Piatetsky-Shapiro |first1=Gregory |authorlink1=Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro |last2=Parker |first2=Gary |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/data_mining_course/x1-intro-to-data-mining-notes.html |title=Lesson: Data Mining, and Knowledge Discovery: An Introduction |publisher=KD Nuggets |year=2011 |work=Introduction to Data Mining |accessdate=30 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the terms ''data mining'' and ''knowledge discovery'' are used interchangeably.

In the academic community, the major forums for research started in 1995 when the First International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery ([[KDD-95]]) was started in Montreal under [[AAAI]] sponsorship. It was co-chaired by [[Usama Fayyad]] and Ramasamy Uthurusamy. A year later, in 1996, Usama Fayyad launched the journal by Kluwer called [[Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery]] as its founding editor-in-chief. Later he started the [[SIGKDD]] Newsletter SIGKDD Explorations.&lt;ref name=SIGKDD-explorations&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fayyad|first1=Usama|title=First Editorial by Editor-in-Chief|journal=SIGKDD Explorations|date=15 June 1999|volume=13|issue=1|pages=102|doi=10.1145/2207243.2207269|url=http://www.kdd.org/explorations/view/june-1999-volume-1-issue-1|accessdate=27 December 2010|ref=SIGKDD-explorations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KDD International conference became the primary highest quality conference in data mining with an acceptance rate of research paper submissions below 18%. The journal ''Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery'' is the primary research journal of the field.

==Background==
The manual extraction of patterns from [[data]] has occurred for centuries. Early methods of identifying patterns in data include [[Bayes' theorem]] (1700s) and [[regression analysis]] (1800s). The proliferation, ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology has dramatically increased data collection, storage, and manipulation ability. As [[data set]]s have grown in size and complexity, direct "hands-on" data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect, automated data processing, aided by other discoveries in computer science, such as [[neural networks]], [[cluster analysis]], [[genetic algorithms]] (1950s), [[decision tree learning|decision trees]] and [[decision rules]] (1960s), and [[support vector machines]] (1990s). Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns&lt;ref name="Kantardzic"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kantardzic |first=Mehmed |title=Data Mining: Concepts, Models, Methods, and Algorithms |year=2003 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=978-0-471-22852-3 |oclc=50055336 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in large data sets. It bridges the gap from [[applied statistics]] and artificial intelligence (which usually provide the mathematical background) to [[database management]] by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently, allowing such methods to be applied to ever larger data sets.

==Process==
The ''knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process'' is commonly defined with the stages:

# Selection
# Pre-processing
# Transformation
# ''Data mining''
# Interpretation/evaluation.&lt;ref name="Fayyad" /&gt;

It exists, however, in many variations on this theme, such as the [[Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining]] (CRISP-DM) which defines six phases:

# Business understanding
# Data understanding
# Data preparation
# Modeling
# Evaluation
# Deployment

or a simplified process such as (1) Pre-processing, (2) Data Mining, and (3) Results Validation.

Polls conducted in 2002, 2004, 2007 and 2014 show that the CRISP-DM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2002) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2002/methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll''], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2004) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2004/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll''], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2007) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2007/data_mining_methodology.htm ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll''], [[Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro]] (2014) [http://www.kdnuggets.com/polls/2014/analytics-data-mining-data-science-methodology.html ''KDnuggets Methodology Poll'']&lt;/ref&gt; The only other data mining standard named in these polls was [[SEMMA]]. However, 3–4 times as many people reported using CRISP-DM. Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models,&lt;ref name="Marban"&gt;Óscar Marbán, Gonzalo Mariscal and Javier Segovia (2009); [http://cdn.intechopen.com/pdfs/5937/InTech-A_data_mining_amp_knowledge_discovery_process_model.pdf ''A Data Mining &amp; Knowledge Discovery Process Model''].

In Proceedings of the IADIS European Conference on Data Mining 2008, pp&amp;nbsp;182–185.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-processing===
Before data mining algorithms can be used, a target data set must be assembled. As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data, the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit. A common source for data is a [[data mart]] or [[data warehouse]]. Pre-processing is essential to analyze the [[Multivariate statistics|multivariate]] data sets before data mining. The target set is then cleaned. Data cleaning removes the observations containing [[statistical noise|noise]] and those with [[missing data]].

===Data mining===
Data mining involves six common classes of tasks:&lt;ref name="Fayyad"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fayyad |first1=Usama |authorlink1=Usama Fayyad |last2=Piatetsky-Shapiro |first2=Gregory|authorlink2=Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro |last3=Smyth |first3=Padhraic |title=From Data Mining to Knowledge Discovery in Databases |year=1996 |url=http://www.kdnuggets.com/gpspubs/aimag-kdd-overview-1996-Fayyad.pdf |accessdate = 17 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Anomaly detection]] (outlier/change/deviation detection) – The identification of unusual data records, that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation.
* [[Association rule learning]] (dependency modelling) – Searches for relationships between variables. For example, a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits. Using association rule learning, the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes. This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis.
* [[Cluster analysis|Clustering]] – is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another "similar", without using known structures in the data.
* [[Statistical classification|Classification]] – is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data. For example, an e-mail program might attempt to classify an e-mail as "legitimate" or as "spam".
* [[Regression analysis|Regression]] – attempts to find a function which models the data with the least error that is, for estimating the relationships among data or datasets.
* [[Automatic summarization|Summarization]] – providing a more compact representation of the data set, including visualization and report generation.

===Results validation===
[[File:Spurious correlations - spelling bee spiders.svg|thumb|An example of data produced by [[data dredging]] through a bot operated by statistician Tyler Vigen, apparently showing a close link between the best word winning a spelling bee competition and the number of people in the United States killed by venomous spiders. The similarity in trends is obviously a coincidence.]]
Data mining can unintentionally be misused, and can then produce results which appear to be significant; but which do not actually predict future behaviour and cannot be [[Reproducibility|reproduced]] on a new sample of data and bear little use. Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper [[statistical hypothesis testing]]. A simple version of this problem in [[machine learning]] is known as [[overfitting]], but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train/test split - when applicable at all - may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening.&lt;ref name=hawkins&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hawkins | first1 = Douglas M | year = 2004 | title = The problem of overfitting | url = | journal = Journal of Chemical Information and Computer Sciences | volume = 44 | issue = 1| pages = 1–12 | doi=10.1021/ci0342472| pmid = 14741005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Missing information|section|non-classification tasks in data mining. It only covers [[machine learning]]|date=September 2011}}
The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set. Not all patterns found by the data mining algorithms are necessarily valid. It is common for the data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set. This is called [[overfitting]]. To overcome this, the evaluation uses a [[test set]] of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained. The learned patterns are applied to this test set, and the resulting output is compared to the desired output. For example, a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish "spam" from "legitimate" emails would be trained on a [[training set]] of sample e-mails. Once trained, the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e-mails on which it had ''not'' been trained. The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify. A number of statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm, such as [[Receiver operating characteristic|ROC curves]].

If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards, subsequently it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the pre-processing and data mining steps. If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards, then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge.

==Research==
The premier professional body in the field is the [[Association for Computing Machinery]]'s (ACM) Special Interest Group (SIG) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ([[SIGKDD]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://academic.research.microsoft.com/?SearchDomain=2&amp;SubDomain=7&amp;entitytype=2|title=Microsoft Academic Search: Top conferences in data mining | publisher=[[Microsoft Academic Search]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.de/citations?view_op=top_venues&amp;hl=en&amp;vq=eng_datamininganalysis|title=Google Scholar: Top publications - Data Mining &amp; Analysis|publisher=[[Google Scholar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1989, this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kdd.org/conferences.php Proceedings] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430120252/http://www.kdd.org/conferences.php |date=2010-04-30 }}, International Conferences on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, ACM, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; and since 1999 it has published a biannual [[academic journal]] titled "SIGKDD Explorations".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kdd.org/explorations/about.php SIGKDD Explorations], ACM, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer science conferences on data mining include:

* [[CIKM Conference]] – ACM [[Conference on Information and Knowledge Management]]
* [[European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases]]
* [[KDD Conference]] – ACM SIGKDD [[Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining]]

Data mining topics are also present on many [[List of computer science conferences#Data Management|data management/database conferences]] such as the ICDE Conference, [[SIGMOD|SIGMOD Conference]] and [[International Conference on Very Large Data Bases]]

==Standards==
There have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process, for example the 1999 European [[Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining]] (CRISP-DM 1.0) and the 2004 [[Java Data Mining]] standard (JDM 1.0). Development on successors to these processes (CRISP-DM 2.0 and JDM 2.0) was active in 2006, but has stalled since. JDM 2.0 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft.

For exchanging the extracted models – in particular for use in [[predictive analytics]]&amp;nbsp;– the key standard is the [[Predictive Model Markup Language]] (PMML), which is an [[XML]]-based language developed by the Data Mining Group (DMG) and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications. As the name suggests, it only covers prediction models, a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications. However, extensions to cover (for example) [[subspace clustering]] have been proposed independently of the DMG.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Günnemann | first1 = Stephan | last2 = Kremer | first2 = Hardy | last3 = Seidl | first3 = Thomas | doi = 10.1145/2023598.2023605 | chapter = An extension of the PMML standard to subspace clustering models | title = Proceedings of the 2011 workshop on Predictive markup language modeling - PMML '11 | pages = 48 | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1-4503-0837-3 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable uses==
{{Main|Examples of data mining}}
{{Category see also|Applied data mining}}

Data mining is used wherever there is digital data available today. Notable [[examples of data mining]] can be found throughout business, medicine, science, and surveillance.

==Privacy concerns and ethics==
While the term "data mining" itself may have no ethical implications, it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to peoples' behavior (ethical and otherwise).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seltzer, William |title=The Promise and Pitfalls of Data Mining: Ethical Issues |url=https://ww2.amstat.org/committees/ethics/linksdir/Jsm2005Seltzer.pdf|publisher = American Statistical Association|journal = ASA Section on Government Statistics|date = 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy, legality, and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pitts, Chip |title=The End of Illegal Domestic Spying? Don't Count on It |url=http://www.washingtonspectator.com/articles/20070315surveillance_1.cfm |journal=Washington Spectator |date=15 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5SwZyJc43?url=http://www.washingtonspectator.com/articles/20070315surveillance_1.cfm |archivedate=2007-10-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes, such as in the [[Total Information Awareness]] Program or in [[ADVISE]], has raised privacy concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taipale, Kim A. |title=Data Mining and Domestic Security: Connecting the Dots to Make Sense of Data |url=http://www.stlr.org/cite.cgi?volume=5&amp;article=2 |journal=Columbia Science and Technology Law Review |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=15 December 2003 |ssrn=546782 |oclc=45263753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Resig|first1=John|title=A Framework for Mining Instant Messaging Services|url=https://johnresig.com/files/research/SIAMPaper.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data mining requires data preparation which can uncover information or patterns which may compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations. A common way for this to occur is through [[aggregate function|data aggregation]]. Data aggregation involves combining data together (possibly from various sources) in a way that facilitates analysis (but that also might make identification of private, individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent).&lt;ref name="NASCIO"&gt;[http://www.nascio.org/publications/documents/NASCIO-dataMining.pdf ''Think Before You Dig: Privacy Implications of Data Mining &amp; Aggregation''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217063043/http://www.nascio.org/publications/documents/NASCIO-dataMining.pdf |date=2008-12-17 }}, NASCIO Research Brief, September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This is not data mining ''per se'', but a result of the preparation of data before – and for the purposes of – the analysis. The threat to an individual's privacy comes into play when the data, once compiled, cause the data miner, or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set, to be able to identify specific individuals, especially when the data were originally anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Ohm |title=Don't Build a Database of Ruin |publisher=Harvard Business Review |url=http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/dont_build_a_database_of_ruin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Bond-Graham, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/12/03/iron-cagebook/ Iron Cagebook - The Logical End of Facebook's Patents], [[Counterpunch.org]], 2013.12.03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin Bond-Graham, [http://www.counterpunch.org/2013/09/11/inside-the-tech-industrys-startup-conference/ Inside the Tech industry's Startup Conference], [[Counterpunch.org]], 2013.09.11&lt;/ref&gt;

It is recommended that an individual is made aware of the following '''before''' data are collected:&lt;ref name="NASCIO" /&gt;
* the purpose of the data collection and any (known) data mining projects;
* how the data will be used;
* who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives;
* the status of security surrounding access to the data;
* how collected data can be updated.

Data may also be modified so as to ''become'' anonymous, so that individuals may not readily be identified.&lt;ref name="NASCIO" /&gt; However, even "de-identified"/"anonymized" data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals, as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/277 ''AOL search data identified individuals''], SecurityFocus, August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The inadvertent revelation of [[personally identifiable information]] leading to the provider violates Fair Information Practices.   This indiscretion can cause financial,
emotional, or bodily harm to the indicated individual.  In one instance of privacy violation, the patrons of Walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in 2011 for selling
prescription information to data mining companies who in turn provided the data
to pharmaceutical companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Big data׳s impact on privacy, security and consumer welfare|journal = Telecommunications Policy|pages = 1134–1145|volume = 38|issue = 11|doi = 10.1016/j.telpol.2014.10.002|first = Nir|last = Kshetri|year = 2014|url = http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/N_Kshetri_Big_2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in Europe===

Europe has rather strong privacy laws, and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers. However, the [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles|U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor Principles]] currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by U.S. companies. As a consequence of [[Edward Snowden]]'s [[global surveillance disclosure]], there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement, as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the [[National Security Agency]], and attempts to reach an agreement have failed.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Situation in the United States===

In the United States, privacy concerns have been addressed by the [[US Congress]] via the passage of regulatory controls such as the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] (HIPAA). The HIPAA requires individuals to give their "informed consent" regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses. According to an article in ''Biotech Business Week'', "'[i]n practice, HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena,' says the AAHC. More importantly, the rule's goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals."&lt;ref&gt;Biotech Business Week Editors (June 30, 2008); ''BIOMEDICINE; HIPAA Privacy Rule Impedes Biomedical Research'', Biotech Business Week, retrieved 17 November 2009 from LexisNexis Academic&lt;/ref&gt; This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices.

U.S. information privacy legislation such as HIPAA and the [[Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act]] (FERPA) applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses. Use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the U.S. is not controlled by any legislation.

==Copyright law==

===Situation in Europe===

Due to a lack of flexibilities in European copyright and [[Database Directive|database law]], the mining of in-copyright works such as [[web mining]] without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal. Where a database is pure data in Europe there is likely to be no copyright, but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to regulations by the [[Database Directive]]. On the recommendation of the [[Hargreaves review]] this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/ UK Researchers Given Data Mining Right Under New UK Copyright Laws.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609020315/http://www.out-law.com/en/articles/2014/june/researchers-given-data-mining-right-under-new-uk-copyright-laws/ |date=June 9, 2014 }} ''Out-Law.com.''   Retrieved 14 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt; to allow content mining as a [[Limitations and exceptions to copyright|limitation and exception]]. Only the second country in the world to do so after Japan, which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining. However, due to the restriction of the [[Copyright Directive]], the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes. UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions. The [[European Commission]] facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013, under the title of Licences for Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licences for Europe - Structured Stakeholder Dialogue 2013|url=http://ec.europa.eu/licences-for-europe-dialogue/en/content/about-site|website=European Commission|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The focus on the solution to this legal issue being licences and not limitations and exceptions led to representatives of universities, researchers, libraries, civil society groups and [[open access]] publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Text and Data Mining:Its importance and the need for change in Europe|url=http://libereurope.eu/news/text-and-data-mining-its-importance-and-the-need-for-change-in-europe/|website=Association of European Research Libraries|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Situation in the United States===

By contrast to Europe, the flexible nature of US copyright law, and in particular [[fair use]] means that content mining in America, as well as other fair use countries such as Israel, Taiwan and South Korea is viewed as being legal. As content mining is transformative, that is it does not supplant the original work, it is viewed as being lawful under fair use. For example, as part of the [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|Google Book settlement]] the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google's digitisation project of in-copyright books was lawful, in part because of the transformative uses that the digitisation project displayed - one being text and data mining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judge grants summary judgment in favor of Google Books — a fair use victory|url=http://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=a18c5b92-5a20-4d1d-a098-a3095046a88e|website=Lexology.com|publisher=Antonelli Law Ltd|accessdate=14 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diagrammatic reasoning''' is [[reasoning]] by means of [[visual]] [[depiction|representation]]s. The study of ''diagrammatic reasoning'' is about the understanding of concepts and ideas, visualized with the use of [[diagram]]s and [[image]]ry instead of by [[natural language|linguistic]] or [[algebra]]ic means.

==Diagram==
A [[diagram]] is a 2D geometric symbolic [[depiction|representation]] of [[information]] according to some [[illustration|visualization]] technique. Sometimes, the technique uses a [[3D space|3D]] visualization which is then [[3D projection|projected]] onto the 2D surface. The term diagram in common sense can have two meanings.
[[Image:Wikipedia article-creation-2.svg|thumb|250px|Sample [[flowchart]] representing the [[decision process]] to add a new article to Wikipedia.]]
* ''visual information device'': Like the term "[[illustration]]" the diagram is used as a collective term standing for the whole class of technical genres, including [[graphics|graphs]], technical drawings and [[table (information)|table]]s.&lt;ref name="LEB 03"/&gt;
* ''specific kind of visual display'': This is only the genre, that shows qualitative data with shapes that are connected by lines, arrows, or other visual links.

In science the term is used in both ways. For example, Anderson (1997) stated more general "diagrams are pictorial, yet abstract, representations of information, and [[map]]s, [[line graph]]s, [[bar chart]]s, [[engineering]] [[blueprint]]s, and [[architect]]s' [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es are all examples of diagrams, whereas photographs and video are not".&lt;ref name="MA97"&gt;Michael Anderson (1997). [http://zeus.cs.hartford.edu/~anderson/intro.html "Introduction to Diagrammatic Reasoning"]. Retrieved 21 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Lowe (1993) defined diagrams as specifically "abstract graphic portrayals of the subject matter they represent".&lt;ref name="RKL 93"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1075/idj.7.1.01low |last=Lowe |first=Richard K. |year=1993 |title=Diagrammatic information: techniques for exploring its mental representation and processing |journal=Information Design Journal |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=3–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the specific sense diagrams and charts contrast [[computer graphics]], technical illustrations, [[infographics]], maps, and [[technical drawing]]s, by showing "abstract rather than [[literal translation|literal]] representations of information".&lt;ref name="LEB 03"&gt;{{cite book |first=Lee E. |last=Brasseur |authorlink=Lee E. Brasseur |title=Visualizing technical information: a cultural critique |publisher=Baywood Pub |location=Amityville, N.Y. |year=2003 |isbn=0-89503-240-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essences of a diagram can be seen as:&lt;ref name = "LEB 03"/&gt; 
* a ''form'' of visual [[content format|format]]ting devices 
* a ''display'' that does not show [[quantitative data]], but rather relationships and abstract information 
* with ''building blocks'' such as geometrical shapes that are connected by [[wikt:line|line]]s, [[arrow]]s, or other visual links.

Or as Bert S. Hall wrote, "diagrams are simplified figures, caricatures in a way, intended to convey essential meaning".&lt;ref name="BSH96"&gt;Bert S. Hall (1996). "The Didactic and the Elegant: Some Thoughts on Scientific and Technological Illustrations in the Middle Ages and Renaissance". in: B. Braigie (ed.) ''Picturing knowledge: historical and philosophical problems concerning the use of art in science''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press. p.9&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jan V. White]] (1984) "the characteristics of a good diagram are elegance, clarity, ease, pattern, simplicity, and validity".&lt;ref name="LEB 03"/&gt; Elegance for White means that what you are seeing in the diagram is "the simplest and most fitting solution to a problem".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=White |first=Jan V. |title=Using charts and graphs: 1000 ideas for visual persuasion |publisher=Bowker |location=New York |year=1984 |isbn=0-8352-1894-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Logical graph==
A [[logical graph]] is a special type of [[graph theory|graph-theoretic]] structure in any one of several systems of graphical [[syntax (logic)|syntax]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed for [[logic]].

In his papers on ''[[qualitative logic]]'', ''[[entitative graph]]s'', and ''[[existential graph]]s'', Peirce developed several versions of a graphical [[formal system|formalism]], or a graph-theoretic [[formal language]], designed to be interpreted for logic.

In the century since Peirce initiated this line of development, a variety of formal systems have branched out from what is abstractly the same formal base of graph-theoretic structures.

===Conceptual graph===
A [[conceptual graph]] (CG) is a notation for logic based on the [[existential graph]]s of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] and the [[semantic network]]s of [[artificial intelligence]]. In the first published paper on conceptual graphs, [[John F. Sowa]] used them to represent the [[conceptual schema]]s used in database systems. His first book&lt;ref&gt;John F. Sowa (1984). ''Conceptual Structures: Information Processing in Mind and Machine.'' Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; applied them to a wide range of topics in artificial intelligence, computer science, and cognitive science. A linear notation, called the ''Conceptual Graph Interchange Format (CGIF)'', has been standardized in the ISO standard for [[Common Logic]].

[[Image:Cat-on-mat.svg|thumb|250px|Elsie the cat is sitting on a mat]]
The diagram on the right is an example of the ''display form'' for a conceptual graph. Each box is called a ''concept node'', and each oval is called a ''relation node''. In CGIF, this CG would be represented by the following statement:

::[Cat Elsie] [Sitting *x] [Mat *y] (agent ?x Elsie) (location ?x ?y)

In CGIF, brackets enclose the information inside the concept nodes, and parentheses enclose the information inside the relation nodes. The letters x and y, which are called ''coreference labels'', show how the concept and relation nodes are connected. In the ''Common Logic Interchange Format (CLIF)'', those letters are mapped to variables, as in the following statement:

::(exists ((x Sitting) (y Mat)) (and (Cat Elsie) (agent x Elsie) (location x y)))

As this example shows, the asterisks on the coreference labels *x and *y in CGIF map to existentially quantified variables in CLIF, and the question marks on ?x and ?y map to bound variables in CLIF. A universal quantifier, represented ''@every*z'' in CGIF, would be represented ''forall (z)'' in CLIF.

===Entitative graph===
An [[entitative graph]] is an element of the [[graph theory|graphical]] [[syntax]] for [[logic]] that [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] developed under the name of ''qualitative logic'' beginning in the 1880s, taking the coverage of the [[formal system|formalism]] only as far as the [[propositional calculus|propositional or sentential]] aspects of logic are concerned.&lt;ref&gt;See 3.468, 4.434, and 4.564 in Peirce's ''Collected Papers''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[syntax]] is:
* The blank page;
* Single letters, phrases;
* Objects (subgraphs) enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut''. A cut can be empty.

The [[semantics]] are:
* The blank page denotes ''False'';
* Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs can be ''True''' or ''False'';
* To surround objects with a cut is equivalent to Boolean [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes ''Truth'';
* All objects within a given cut are tacitly joined by [[disjunction]].

A "proof" manipulates a graph, using a short list of rules, until the graph is reduced to an empty cut or the blank page. A graph that can be so reduced is what is now called a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] (or the complement thereof). Graphs that cannot be simplified beyond a certain point are analogues of the [[satisfiable]] [[formula]]s of [[first-order logic]].

===Existential graph===
An [[existential graph]] is a type of [[diagram]]matic or visual notation for logical expressions, proposed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], who wrote his first paper on [[logical graph|graphical logic]] in 1882 and continued to develop the method until his death in 1914. Peirce proposed three systems of existential graphs:
* ''alpha'' – [[isomorphism|isomorphic]] to [[sentential logic]] and the [[two-element Boolean algebra]];
* ''beta'' – isomorphic to [[first-order logic]] with identity, with all formulas closed;
* ''gamma'' – (nearly) isomorphic to [[normal modal logic]].
''Alpha'' nests in ''beta'' and ''gamma''. ''Beta'' does not nest in ''gamma'', quantified modal logic being more than even Peirce could envisage.

[[Image:PeirceAlphaGraphs.svg|thumb|250px|Alpha Graphs]]
In ''alpha'' the [[syntax]] is:
* The blank page;
* Single letters or phrases written anywhere on the page;
* Any graph may be enclosed by a [[simple closed curve]] called a ''cut'' or ''sep''. A cut can be empty. Cuts can nest and concatenate at will, but must never intersect.

Any well-formed part of a graph is a ''subgraph''.

The [[semantics]] are:
* The blank page denotes ''Truth'';
* Letters, phrases, subgraphs, and entire graphs may be ''True'' or ''False'';
* To enclose a subgraph with a cut is equivalent to logical [[negation]] or Boolean [[Complement (order theory)|complementation]]. Hence an empty cut denotes ''False'';
* All subgraphs within a given cut are tacitly [[conjunction (logic)|conjoined]].

Hence the ''alpha'' graphs are a minimalist notation for [[sentential logic]], grounded in the expressive adequacy of ''And'' and ''Not''. The ''alpha'' graphs constitute a radical simplification of the [[two-element Boolean algebra]] and the [[connective (logic)|truth functors]].

==Characteristica universalis==
[[Characteristica universalis]], commonly interpreted as ''universal characteristic'', or ''universal character'' in English, is a universal and formal language imagined by the German philosopher [[Gottfried Leibniz]] able to express mathematical, scientific, and metaphysical concepts. Leibniz thus hoped to create a language usable within the framework of a universal logical calculation or ''[[calculus ratiocinator]]''.

[[Image:Characteristica universalis diagram.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Leibniz's diagrammatic reasoning.]]
Since the ''characteristica universalis'' is diagrammatic and employs [[pictograms]] (below left), the diagrams in Leibniz's work warrant close study. On at least two occasions, Leibniz illustrated his philosophical reasoning with diagrams. One diagram, the frontispiece to his 1666 ''[[De Arte Combinatoria]]'' (On the Art of Combinations), represents the Aristotelian theory of how all material things are formed from combinations of the elements earth, water, air, and fire.

[[Image:LeibnizCharacters.jpg|thumb|225px|left|Basic elements of Leibniz's pictograms.]]
These four elements make up the four corners of a diamond (see picture to right). Opposing pairs of these are joined by a bar labeled "contraries" (earth-air, fire-water). At the four corners of the superimposed square are the four qualities defining the elements. Each adjacent pair of these is joined by a bar labeled "possible combination"; the diagonals joining them are labeled "impossible combination."  Starting from the top, fire is formed from the combination of dryness and heat; air from wetness and heat; water from coldness and wetness; earth from coldness and dryness.&lt;ref&gt;This diagram is reproduced in several texts including ''Saemtliche Schriften und Briefe'', Reihe VI, Band 1: 166, Loemker 1969: 83, 366, Karl Popp and Erwin Stein 2000: 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Venn-II reasoning system==
In the early 1990s [[Sun-Joo Shin]] presented an extension of Existential Graphs called Venn-II.&lt;ref&gt;Shin, Sun-Joo. 1994. The Logical Status of Diagrams. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Syntax and semantics are given formally, together with a set of ''Rules of Transformation'' which are shown to be sound and complete. Proofs proceed by applying the rules (which remove or add syntactic elements to or from diagrams) sequentially. Venn-II is equivalent in expressive power to a first-order monadic language.

The '''Doctor of Management''' (D.M., D.Mgt. or DMan) is a [[doctoral degree]] focusing on advanced study and research in the applied science and practice of professional [[management]].&lt;ref name=Herts&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/courses/dmanma-by-research|title=Professional Doctorate in Management|publisher=[[University of Hertfordshire]]|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and focus==
The D.M. was introduced at [[Case Western Reserve]] in 1995,&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; and several universities have since developed their own programs. In the UK, the Doctor of Management (DMan) was introduced at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=DMan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/word_doc/0018/25209/CMGdman-brochure2011.docx|title=Doctor of Management/Master of Arts|publisher=University of Hertfordshire|date=December 2010|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.M. program is an applied professional practice doctorate including a similar strong emphasis on research to the academically-equivalent [[PhD in management]], but with a focus on the application of management theories rather than on developing and extending those theories.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"&gt;{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132958/http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx| archive-date=20 December 2017|format=PDF|url=http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx | title=D.M. or Ph.D. in Management?| accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to research, it is focused on developing the talents, skills and abilities of organization executives and experienced management professionals.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aasa.org/SchoolAdministratorArticle.aspx?id=6624 | title=A Degree of Difference: A Doctorate in Management| accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D.M. versus Ph.D.===
In most cases, the distinction between the degrees is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D. is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the D.M. further emphasizes applied research leading to the practical application of this theoretical knowledge. The Ph.D. thus prepares students for careers in academia, while the D.M. is more aimed at those seeking a career in management.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"/&gt; Some D.M. programs require a [[dissertation]], while others have replaced this with a number of applied research projects.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; 

The British DMan is a professional doctorate with the same academic status as a Ph.D.&lt;ref name=DMan/&gt; The U.S. Doctor of Management is also a professional doctorate but is not (as of the report ''Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014'') recognised as a Ph.D.-equivalent research doctorate by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/technotes.cfm|title=Technical Notes|work= Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014 |date=December 2015|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this doctorate is sometimes viewed as a variant of the Ph.D. in Management (especially when a dissertation is required in the program).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Program structure==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
To be admitted as a doctoral management student in the U.S., one must hold a [[Business education#Postgraduate education|management-related]] [[master's degree]], have sufficient managerial experience, and pass a comprehensive entrance exam or doctoral essay. In the UK (and in many programs in the U.S.), there is a minimum of five years of management or professional consulting experience required. In the UK, an [[honours degree]] plus a relevant master's degree is preferred.&lt;ref name=Herts/&gt; The student must then complete necessary [[coursework]] (typically focused on [[Management#Management skills|leadership]] and [[business strategy|strategy]], and including training in [[research methodology]]), perform independent original [[thesis|research]] under supervision of a qualified [[doctoral advisor]], pass the doctoral dissertation or doctoral [[thesis defense]], and in some cases, teach examinable courses.

Although it can be completed in as little as three years, the D.M. typically takes 4–6 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB article about a PhD in Business and Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two years of the program are usually focused on intensive doctoral-level coursework and generally at least one research practicum (near the end of core courses, residencies, and research and writing training). It may be followed by a comprehensive examination (comps) at this point if the candidate has successfully reached this stage.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the PhD, the subsequent dissertation completion phase for the D.M. can take an additional two or more years. In some programs where the candidate has a good deal of professional management practical experience, the D.M. can be completed in as little as three years if the candidate has proven capable of taking a full load of credits each term, as well as successful completion of the required dissertation and its defense.

===Research methodologies===
Common research methodologies used in management studies include both quantitative and qualitative approaches such as: [[Business model|Modeling]], [[Econometrics]], [[Experiment]]s, Descriptive and Field Studies, [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenology]], [[Case Study]], [[Action Research]] or [[Mixed Methods]] strategies of inquiry.

The '''Economic Scholars Program''' (ESP) is an annual conference  in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] that highlights undergraduate research in economics and business.  It is co-hosted by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas]] and [[Austin College]]. The conference is typically held on the last Friday in March or first Friday in April&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasfed.org/educate/events/esp.cfm | title=ESP About | publisher=Dallas Federal Reserve | accessdate=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is modeled after professional economics conferences. Undergraduate students participate in the conference as presenters of original or faculty-coauthored research, discussants, session chairs or audience member participants. Each level of participation in the program is designed to reflect the growing interests and skills of undergraduate students. Additionally, the ESP added a poster session in 2011 to accommodate more student research.

The 6th annual conference, held in 2012, hosted undergraduate students and faculty mentors representing 35 different undergraduate institutions from 19 states. In terms of the number of attendees, papers, and posters presented it is the largest conference focusing on undergraduate research in economics.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

'''Eternal return''' (also known as '''eternal recurrence''') is a theory that the [[universe]] and all existence and energy has been recurring, and will continue to recur, in a [[self-similar]] form an [[infinity|infinite]] number of times across infinite time or space.
The theory is found in [[Indian philosophy]] and in [[ancient Egypt]] and was subsequently taken up by the [[Pythagoreans]] and [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/ Stoics]. With the decline of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] and the spread of [[Christianity]], the theory fell into disuse in the [[Western world]], with the exception of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], who connected the thought to many of his other concepts, including ''[[amor fati]]''. Eternal return is based on the philosophy of pre-determinism in that people are predestined to continue repeating the same events over and over again.

==Premise==
The basic premise proceeds from the assumption that the [[probability]] of a world coming into existence exactly like our own is nonzero. If [[space]] and time are infinite, then it follows logically that our existence must recur an infinite number of times.&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark M., "Parallel universes". Sci. Am. 2003 May; 288(5):40–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871 [[Louis Auguste Blanqui]], assuming a Newtonian cosmology where time and space are infinite, claimed to have demonstrated eternal recurrence as a mathematical certainty.&lt;ref&gt;

== Classical antiquity ==

[[File:Egypt.KV6.04.jpg|thumb|right|[[Scarabaeus sacer|Scarab]] on a [[fresco]].]]

In [[ancient Egypt]], the scarab ([[dung beetle]]) was viewed as a sign of eternal renewal and reemergence of life, a reminder of the life to come. (See also [[Atum]] and [[Ma'at]].)

The [[Maya calendar#Maya concepts of time|Mayans]] and [[Aztec calendar|Aztecs]] also took a cyclical view of time.

In [[ancient Greece]], the concept of eternal return was connected with [[Empedocles]], [[Zeno of Citium]], and most notably in [[Stoicism]] (see [[ekpyrosis]]).

== Indian religions ==
{{Religious text primary|section|date=February 2018}}
{{See also|End time in Indian religions}}
The concept of cyclical patterns is prominent in [[Indian religions]], such as [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Buddhism]] among others. The important distinction is that events don't repeat endlessly but souls take birth until they attain salvation. The [[Bhavacakra|wheel of life]] represents an endless cycle of birth, life, and death from which one seeks liberation.  In [[Tantric Buddhism]], a [[wheel of time]] concept known as the [[Kalachakra]] expresses the idea of an endless cycle of existence and knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Friedrich Nietzsche&lt;!--linked from 'Amor fati'--&gt; ==
The concept of "eternal recurrence", the idea that with infinite time and a finite number of events, events will recur again and again infinitely, is central to the writings of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;http://myweb.lmu.edu/tshanahan/Nietzsche-Eternal_Recurrence.html&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Heidegger]] points out in his lectures on Nietzsche, Nietzsche's first mention of eternal recurrence, in aphorism 341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' (cited below), presents this concept as a [[Thought experiment|hypothetical ''question'']] rather than postulating it as a fact.  According to Heidegger, it is the burden imposed by the ''question'' of eternal recurrence—whether or not such a thing could possibly be true—that is so significant in modern thought: "The way Nietzsche here patterns the first communication of the thought of the 'greatest burden' [of eternal recurrence] makes it clear that this 'thought of thoughts' is at the same time 'the most burdensome thought.' "&lt;ref&gt;See Heidegger ''Nietzsche. Volume II: The Eternal Recurrence of the Same'' trans. [[David Farrell Krell]]. New York: Harper and Row, 1984. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thought of eternal recurrence appears in a few of his works, in particular §285 and §341 of ''[[The Gay Science]]'' and then in ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]''. The most complete treatment of the subject appears in the work entitled ''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'', a work which was published in 2007 alongside [[Søren Kierkegaard]]'s own version of eternal return, which he calls 'repetition'. Nietzsche sums up his thought most succinctly when he addresses the reader with: "Everything has returned. Sirius,  and the spider, and thy thoughts at this moment, and this last thought of thine that all things will return". However, he also expresses his thought at greater length when he says to his reader:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whoever thou mayest be, beloved stranger, whom I meet here for the first time, avail thyself of this happy hour and of the stillness around us, and above us, and let me tell thee something of the thought which has suddenly risen before me like a star which would fain shed down its rays upon thee and every one, as befits the nature of light. - Fellow man! Your whole life, like a sandglass, will always be reversed and will ever run out again, - a long minute of time will elapse until all those conditions out of which you were evolved return in the wheel of the cosmic process. And then you will find every pain and every pleasure, every friend and every enemy, every hope and every error, every blade of grass and every ray of sunshine once more, and the whole fabric of things which make up your life. This ring in which you are but a grain will glitter afresh forever. And in every one of these cycles of human life there will be one hour where, for the first time one man, and then many, will perceive the mighty thought of the eternal recurrence of all things:- and for mankind this is always the hour of Noon".&lt;ref&gt;''Notes on the Eternal Recurrence'' - Vol. 16 of Oscar Levy Edition of Nietzsche's Complete Works (in English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This thought is indeed also noted in a posthumous fragment.&lt;ref&gt;1881 (11 [143])&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this thought is dated by Nietzsche himself, via posthumous fragments, to August 1881, at [[Sils im Engadin/Segl|Sils-Maria]]. In ''[[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]]'' (1888), he wrote that he thought of the eternal return as the "fundamental conception" of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra''.&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, [[Ecce Homo (book)|Ecce Homo]], "Why I Write Such Good Books", "Thus Spoke Zarathustra", §1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Am Stein der Ewigen Wiederkunft.JPG|thumb|Scene of Nietzsche's inspiration: „by a massive, pyramidally piled up block not far from [[Surlej|Surlei]]“.]]

Several authors have pointed out other occurrences of this hypothesis in contemporary thought. [[Rudolf Steiner]], who revised the first catalogue of Nietzsche's personal library in January 1896, pointed out that Nietzsche would have read something similar in [[Eugen Dühring]]'s ''Courses on philosophy'' (1875), which Nietzsche readily criticized. [[Lou Andreas-Salomé]] pointed out that Nietzsche referred to ancient cyclical conceptions of time, in particular by the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], in the ''Untimely Meditations''. [[Henri Lichtenberger]] and [[Charles Andler]] have pinpointed three works contemporary to Nietzsche which carried on the same hypothesis: J.G. Vogt, ''Die Kraft. Eine real-monistische Weltanschauung'' (1878), [[Auguste Blanqui]], ''[http://classiques.uqac.ca/classiques/blanqui_louis_auguste/eternite_par_les_astres/eternite_.html L'éternité par les astres]'' (1872) and [[Gustave Le Bon]], ''L'homme et les sociétés'' (1881). [[Walter Benjamin]] juxtaposes Blanqui and Nietzsche's discussion of eternal recurrence in his unfinished, monumental work ''[[The Arcades Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Benjamin]]. ''The Arcades Project''. Trans. Howard Eiland and Kevin McLaughlin. Cambridge: Belknap-Harvard, 2002. See chapter D, "Boredom Eternal Return," pp. 101-119.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gustave Le Bon is not quoted anywhere in Nietzsche's manuscripts; and Auguste Blanqui was named only in 1883. Vogt's work, on the other hand, was read by Nietzsche during this summer of 1881 in Sils-Maria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |title=? |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116044517/http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn.html |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }} and {{cite web |url=http://www.item.ens.fr/nietzsche/bn/catalogues.html |title=revision of previous catalogues }} on the [[École Normale Supérieure]]'s website&lt;/ref&gt; Blanqui is mentioned by [[Albert Lange]] in his ''[[Geschichte des Materialismus]]'' (History of Materialism), a book closely read by Nietzsche.&lt;ref name=Fouillee&gt;Alfred Fouillée, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Note_sur_Nietzsche_et_Lange_:_%C2%AB_le_retour_%C3%A9ternel_%C2%BB "Note sur Nietzsche et Lange: le "retour éternel"], in ''Revue philosophique de la France et de l'étranger''. An. 34. Paris 1909. T. 67, S. 519-525 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The eternal recurrence is also mentioned in passing by the Devil in Part Four, Book XI, Chapter 9 of Dostoevsky's ''[[The Brothers Karamazov]]'', which is another possible source that Nietzsche may have been drawing upon.

[[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] suggests that Nietzsche may have encountered this idea in the works of [[Heinrich Heine]], who once wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]ime is infinite, but the things in time, the concrete bodies, are finite. They may indeed disperse into the smallest particles; but these particles, the atoms, have their determinate numbers, and the numbers of the configurations which, all of themselves, are formed out of them is also determinate. Now, however long a time may pass, according to the eternal laws governing the combinations of this eternal play of repetition, all configurations which have previously existed on this earth must yet meet, attract, repulse, kiss, and corrupt each other again...&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche; Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist.'' 1959, page 376.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nietzsche calls the idea "horrifying and paralyzing",{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} referring to it as a burden of the "heaviest weight" ("''das schwerste Gewicht''")&lt;ref&gt;Kundera, Milan. ''The Unbearable Lightness of Being''. 1999, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; imaginable.  He professes that the wish for the eternal return of all events would mark the ultimate affirmation of life:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: 'This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more' ... Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: 'You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.{{'}} [''[[The Gay Science]]'', §341]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

To comprehend eternal recurrence in his thought, and to not merely come to peace with it but to embrace it, requires ''[[amor fati]]'', "love of fate":&lt;ref name=dudl&gt;Dudley, Will. ''Hegel, Nietzsche, and Philosophy: Thinking Freedom''. 2002, page 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My formula for human greatness is ''amor fati'': that one wants to have nothing different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely to bear the necessary, still less to conceal it—all idealism is mendaciousness before the necessary—but to ''love'' it.&lt;ref name=dudl /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Carl Jung's seminar on ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'', Jung claims that the dwarf states the idea of the eternal return before Zarathustra finishes his argument of the eternal return when the dwarf says, "'Everything straight lies,' murmured the dwarf disdainfully.  'All truth is crooked, time itself is a circle.'" However, Zarathustra rebuffs the dwarf in the following paragraph, warning him against over-simplifications.&lt;ref&gt;Gildersleeve, M. (2015). The Gay Science and the Rosarium Philosophorum. Agathos, 6(2), 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Albert Camus ==
The philosopher and writer [[Albert Camus]] explores the notion of "eternal return" in his essay on "The Myth of Sisyphus", in which the repetitive nature of existence comes to represent life's absurdity, something the hero seeks to withstand through manifesting what [[Paul Tillich]] called "The Courage to Be".  Though the task of rolling the stone repeatedly up the hill without end is inherently meaningless, the challenge faced by Sisyphus is to refrain from despair.  Hence Camus famously concludes that, "one must imagine Sisyphus happy."

== Opposing argument ==

Nietzsche scholar [[Walter Kaufmann (philosopher)|Walter Kaufmann]] has described an argument originally put forward by [[Georg Simmel]], which rebuts the claim that a finite number of states must repeat within an infinite amount of time:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Even if there were exceedingly few things in a finite space in an infinite time, they would not have to repeat in the same configurations. Suppose there were three wheels of equal size, rotating on the same axis, one point marked on the circumference of each wheel, and these three points lined up in one straight line. If the second wheel rotated twice as fast as the first, and if the speed of the third wheel was 1/π of the speed of the first, the initial line-up would never recur.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Walter. ''Nietzsche: Philosopher, Psychologist, Antichrist''. (Fourth Edition)  Princeton University Press, 1974. p327&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Thus a system could have an infinite number of distinct physical configurations that never recur. However the example presupposes the possibility of perfect continuity: for instance, if the universe proves to have a [[quantum foam]] nature, then the exact quantity of an irrational number cannot be expressed by any physical object.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The '''''Etymologicum Genuinum''''' (standard abbreviation '''''E Gen''''') is the conventional modern title given to a [[Lexicography|lexical]] [[encyclopedia]] compiled at [[Constantinople]] in the mid ninth century. The anonymous compiler drew on the works of numerous earlier lexicographers and [[scholiasts]], both ancient and recent, including [[Aelius Herodianus]], [[Georgius Choeroboscus]], [[Saints Cyril and Methodius|Saint Methodius]], [[Orion of Thebes]], [[Oros of Alexandria]] and  [[Theognostus the Grammarian]].&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 1-69; Alpers (1969) 3-24; Alpers (1989)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' was possibly a product of the intellectual circle around [[Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]]. It was an important source for the subsequent Byzantine lexicographical tradition, including the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]'', ''[[Etymologicum Gudianum]]'' and ''[[Etymologicum Symeonis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Berger (1972); Rance (2007) 201-206&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholarship discovered the ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' only in the nineteenth century. It is preserved in two tenth-century [[manuscripts]], ''Codex Vaticanus Graecus'' 1818 (= A) and ''Codex Laurentianus Sancti Marci'' 304 (= B; AD 994). Neither contains the earliest [[recension]] nor the complete text, but rather two different abridgements. The manuscript evidence and citations in later works suggest that the original title was simply τὸ Ἐτυμολογικόν and later τὸ μέγα Ἐτυμολογικόν. Its modern name was coined in 1897 by [[Richard Reitzenstein]], who was the first to edit a sample section.&lt;ref&gt;Reitzenstein (1897) 11-44&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Etymologicum Genuinum'' remains for the most part unpublished except for specimen glosses.&lt;ref&gt;Colonna (1967); Alpers (1969); Berger (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Two editions are in long-term preparation, one begun by [[Ada Adler]] and continued by [[Klaus Alpers]],&lt;ref&gt;Alpers (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; the other by [[François Lasserre]] and [[Nikolaos Livadaras]].&lt;ref&gt;Lasserre and Livadaras (1976- )&lt;/ref&gt; The latter edition is published under the title ''Etymologicum Magnum Genuinum'', but this designation is not widely used and is a potential source of confusion with the twelfth-century lexical compendium conventionally titled the ''[[Etymologicum Magnum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;E.

A '''fermata''' ({{IPA-it|ferˈmaːta|lang}}; "from ''fermare'', to stay, or stop";&lt;ref&gt;Stainer, John and Barrett, William Alexander (1898). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=K2H0AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=%22fermata%22+stainer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja4JKJu93UAhUJyWMKHcpBD2EQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22fermata%22%20stainer&amp;f=false Stainer and Barrett's Dictionary of Musical Terms]'', p.169. Novello. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as a '''hold''', '''pause''', colloquially a '''birdseye''' or '''cyclops eye''', or as a '''grand pause''' when placed on a [[Musical note|note]] or a [[Rest (music)|rest]]) is a symbol of [[musical notation]] indicating that the [[Note (music)|note]] should be prolonged beyond the normal [[duration (music)|duration]] its [[note value]] would indicate.&lt;ref name="Music p. 310"&gt;''The Harvard Dictionary of Music'', p. 310&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly how much longer it is held is up to the discretion of the performer or conductor, but twice as long is common. It is usually printed above but can be occasionally below (when it is upside down) the note to be extended.

When a fermata is placed over a [[bar (music)|bar]] or double-bar, it is used to indicate the end of a phrase or section of a work. In a [[concerto]], it indicates the point at which the soloist is to play a [[cadenza]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

A fermata can occur at the end of a piece (or [[movement (music)|movement]]) or 
in the middle of a piece. It can be followed by either a brief rest or more notes.&lt;ref&gt;McElheran, ''Conducting Technique'', Chapter XVII, "Fermatas", p. 85. The author classifies them into three types: fermatas followed by uninterrrupted sound, fermatas followed "by a short period of silence," and fermatas "followed by a long period of silence." After that classification, the author gives detailed advice for conducting each type.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Fermata is the Italian name for the sign (&amp;#x1D110;), which in English is commonly called a Pause, and signifies that the note over which it is placed should be held on beyond its natural duration. It is sometimes put over a bar or double  bar, in which case it intimates a short interval of [[silence]].&lt;ref name="Grove21"&gt;Grove, et. al.; eds. (1906). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=6eS2AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=fermata+grove%27s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwino7CcuN3UAhVC52MKHZmXC9gQ6AEIKjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=fermata%20grove%27s&amp;f=false Grove's dictionary of music and musicians]'', p.21. Macmillan. {{pre-ISBN}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other names for a fermata are ''corona'' (Italian), ''point d'orgue'' (French), ''Fermate'' (German), and ''calderón'' (Spanish).&lt;ref name="Music p. 310"/&gt;

==History and use==
[[File:Fermata (Inverted).svg|51px|right]]

This symbol appears as early as the 15th century. It is quite common in the works of [[Guillaume Du Fay]] and [[Josquin des Prez]].

In [[chorale]]s by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and other composers of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]], the fermata often signifies only the end of a [[phrase (music)|phrase]], and a breath is to be taken. In a few [[organ (music)|organ]] compositions, the fermatas occur in different measures for the right and left hands and for the feet, which would make holding them impractical. "In the older music the sign for the fermata is used, as frequently by Bach, merely as indicating the end of the piece, after a Da Capo, when modern composers usually write the word 'fine.' It does not then imply any pause in the music between the first and second part of the number."&lt;ref name="Grove21"/&gt;

In the classical and baroque eras, fermatas were usually points at which performers were expected to improvise cadenzas commensurate with its place in the score: in the middle of a movement required short cadenzas, over a I{{supsub|6|4}} and it implied the kind of cadenzas that are associated with the ending of concerto movements.

The word '''''lunga''''' (shortened form of the Italian ''lunga pausa'', meaning "long pause") is sometimes added above a fermata to indicate a longer duration, the length of which is at the discretion of the performer rather than note values.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Lunga|author=David Fallows|access-date=May 31, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fermata square.png|51px|right]]
[[File:Fermata triangle.png|51px|right]]

Some modern composers (including [[Francis Poulenc]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], [[György Kurtág]], and [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]) have expanded the symbol's usage to indicate approximate duration, incorporating fermatas of different sizes, square- and triangle-shaped fermatas, and so on to indicate holds of different lengths. However, that is not standard usage. In the music notation program, [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]], "By default, a regular fermata is set to 1.5 times written duration, a long (square) fermata is set to 1.75 times written duration, and a short (triangular) fermata is set to 1.25 written duration."&lt;ref&gt;Spreadbury, Daniel; Eastwood, Michael; Finn, Ben; and Finn, Jonathan (March 2008). "Sibelius 5 Reference", p.284. Edition 5.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a whole note with fermata would last 4+2=6 quarter notes, 4+3=7 quarter notes, or 4+1=5 quarter notes, respectively.

The ''fermata'' sign is encoded in the Musical Symbols block of Unicode as U+1D110 MUSICAL SYMBOL FERMATA:&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf PDF of Musical Symbols block from the unicode consortium]&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;#x1D110; and U+1D111 MUSICAL SYMBOL FERMATA BELOW: &amp;#x1D111;

The '''Foramen cecum''', in [[dental anthropology]], is a minor expression of the [[protosylid]] of the tooth. It is thus indirectly related to the five non-metric [[dental crown]] traits.  According to dental, biological studies, racially mixed populations have been discovered with deformed Foramen cecums, resulting in unique tooth groove patterns. Some dentists and scientists have hypothesized that Foramen cecums could in fact be a trait frequency exhibiting [[sexual dimorphism]].

Fossas and pits located in the protosylid, a Foramen cecum, have seemingly become rarer and rare over time. Most populations suffer from furrows of the cusps; most, however, do not develop problems located in the protosylid.

== Causes ==
Forever wars can happen for a variety of reasons, such as military or political reasons.

=== Military ===
Poor military planning is one of the major reasons that a forever war can occur. If the territory gained in a war is not occupied/controlled properly, this allows a deadly insurgency to occur, thus potentially stretching out a war that never ends, which is termed as a forever war.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Similarly, warfare that is fought irregularly, such as rebellions in Africa, do not have a set of military objectives in mind, usually because these rebel groups intend to commit war crimes against the civilian population. Thus, the lack of actual military goals can in itself be a reason that a forever war can occur.  As well, a very large defense budget may also be a factor in the transpiration of a forever war.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spinney|first=Franklin|date=Fall 2011|title=The Domestic Roots of Perpetual War|url=|journal=Challenge|volume=54|pages=54–69|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows a country to fight several forever wars. As of 2018, the United States has a high military budget that is larger than their budget for World War II, allowing for inflation, which enables them to fight wars forever in Iraq and other countries.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The idea of a forever war can also extend to [[civil war]]s. Simply, civil wars can last for a prolonged period of time whenever a military [[stalemate]] occurs between both sides.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fearon|first=James D.|title=Why Do Some Civil Wars Last So Much Longer than Others?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0022343304043770|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=41|issue=3|pages=275–301|doi=10.1177/0022343304043770}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political ===
One major political reason as to why a forever war can occur is due to the lack of [[democracy]] in a country, as this makes a country more likely to become engulfed in a civil war.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Politically, forever wars can occur in order to keep money flowing into institutions, such as the [[Military-industrial-Congressional complex|Military-Industrial-Congressional Complex]] (MICC).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Thus, forever wars can serve as domestic political engines. The continuous changes in capitalism in globalized markets influences policy makers.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aravamudan|first=Srinivas|date=2009|title=Introduction: Perpetual War|jstor=25614381|journal=PMLA|volume=124|issue=5|pages=1505–1514}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, in turn, causes the policy makers to promote policies of continuing and expanding wars.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As well, forever wars can be used by small armed groups in an attempt to wear down a larger group or country. For example, in the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the beginning of the [[War on Terror]], [[Al-Qaeda]] attempted to get the United States involved in a prolonged guerrilla war in [[Afghanistan]], or in other words a forever war.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mondrian.die.udec.cl/~mmedina/Desvarios/Files/Danner-TakingStockOfTheForeverWar.pdf|title=Taking Stock of the Forever War|last=Danner|first=Mark|date=11 September 2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=28 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for this was to destroy American will to fight such a long war, and ultimately force the United States to not only withdraw from Afghanistan, but from the [[Middle East]] as well.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Thus, forever wars can be started in an attempt to achieve political goals for armed groups.

=== Other Reasons ===
Wars that are between ethnic and/or ideological groups can also be a cause of a forever war.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This is because these wars are harder to end with a negotiated peace deal due to the different interests of the two sides as it is difficult to meet the demands of both parties.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As well, financial support for a rebellion or country, such as rebel groups selling illegal products or taxing civilians on one side of the conflict can cause a forever war, as the financial assistance allows rebellion groups to be able to fight longer with more supplies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== The War On Terror ==
{{Main|The War on Terror}}

Traditionally, the term [[War]] referred to the physical and conventional act of engaging in armed conflict. However, the implications of what war entails has evolved over time. The War on Terror has often been cited as a forever war, being a war with “no specific battlefield and the enemy isn’t an army”.&lt;ref name="Inside terrorism"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoffman|first1=Bruce|title=Inside terrorism|date=2006|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231126991|edition= Revised and expanded}}&lt;/ref&gt; The War on Terror has been directed at countless 'enemies' as it has no clear target. Georgetown University Historian [[Bruce Hoffman]] describes traditional war as a war that "ends with the vanquishing of an opponent, with some form or armistice or truce- some kind of surrender instrument or document".&lt;ref name="Inside terrorism"/&gt; In contrast, The War on Terror continues to rage on, with no end in sight.

The [[War on Terror]] arose after the [[September 11th Terrorist Attacks]] in the [[United States]]. As a response, the United States government were looking to declare war, unfortunately they did not know who to declare it on. In the hours following the attack, [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|The Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF)]] began to take form. American lawyer [[Timothy Flanigan]] was tasked with constructing the legislation that would become the framework as a basis for the War on Terror.&lt;ref name="Season 12 Episode 7"/&gt; This document has been the legal justification for the United States War on Terror. With extremely vague wording and broad language, the AUMF allowed for the President to justify attacks, strikes, detainments and countless other military actions under the premise of protecting American citizens and avenging the September 11th attacks.{{quote|"That the president is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on 9/11 or harbor such organizations or persons in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=United States of America|first1=107th Congress|title=Public Law 107-40|date=September 18, 2001|publisher=Congressional Record|edition= Vol. 147}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These words lead to arguably the longest war in American history.&lt;ref name="Season 12 Episode 7"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kielty|first1=Matthew|last2=Padgett|first2=Kelsey|title=60 Words|url=http://www.radiolab.org/story/60-words/|website=RadioLab|publisher=RadioLab|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The War on Drugs == 
{{Main|War on Drugs}}

The 1960s gave birth to a rebellious movement that popularized drug use. "Hippies" sought to expand their minds with the use of hallucinogens like LSD, whilst many soldiers returned from the [[Vietnam War]] with heroin habits. Demand for drugs skyrocketed in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"&gt;{{cite web|title=The United States War on Drugs|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/paradox/htele.html|website=web.stanford.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1971, [[President Nixon]] declared a “war on drugs.” He dramatically increased the size and presence of federal drug control agencies, and pushed through measures such as mandatory sentencing and no-knock warrants.

The Federal Bureau of Narcotics also used propaganda as a preventative measure. Myths and horror stories were spread about drugs. Marijuana was blamed for bizarre cases of insanity, murder, and sex crimes.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt;

A top Nixon aide, [[John Ehrlichman]], later admitted: “You want to know what this was really all about. The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying. We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”Nixon temporarily placed marijuana in Schedule One, the most restrictive category of drugs, pending review by a commission he appointed led by Republican Pennsylvania Governor [[Raymond Shafer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of the Drug War|url=http://www.drugpolicy.org/issues/brief-history-drug-war|website=Drug Policy Alliance|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, after a failed experimental and controversial methadone maintenance program, Nixon addressed Congress and declared "as long as there is a demand, there will be those willing to take the risks of meeting the demand.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt; " In this statement, he publicly proclaimed that all efforts of interdiction and eradication are destined to fail.

Not learning from past presidents, [[President Reagan]] gave a speech in 1981 that mirrored that of Nixon's 10 years prior. He believed it was more effective to take the customers away from the drug, rather than take the drugs from the customers.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt; The average annual funding for eradication and interdiction programs increased from $437 million during [[President Carter|Carter]]'s presidency to $1.4 billion during Reagan's first term.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt;

Reagan's initiatives focused on "getting tough" on drugs. The [[Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986|1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act]] gave the drug user full accountability. Users were to be prosecuted for possession and accordingly penalized.&lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt; This demand side of drug policy reflects a colonial, moralist view of addiction.

Since the initial declaration of a "War on Drugs" in 1971, the United States has: 1) Put half a million people in prison: $10 Billion per year 2) Spent billions on expanded law enforcement 3) Fomented violence and death (in gang turf wars, overdoses, shared needles/AIDS) 4) Eroded civil rights (property can be confiscated BEFORE you are found guilty) 5) Enriched criminal organizations &lt;ref name="The United States War on Drugs"/&gt;

A war that seemingly has no end. A war fought for all sorts of reasons, none of them clear. This "war" was approached differently by each consecutive president, none of whom were successful to any degree in the eradication or control of drugs in the U.S..

==History==
The practice of modern "real time" disc jockey mixing was preceded by radio personalities who introduced and played individual selections of recorded music on broadcast radio stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brewster|first=Bill|authorlink=Bill Brewster (DJ)|title=Last Night a DJ Saved my Life|publisher=Headline|pages=29|year=2006|isbn=0-7553-1398-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1935, American radio commentator [[Walter Winchell]] coined the term "disc jockey" (the combination of ''disc'', referring to the disc records, and ''jockey'', which is an operator of a machine) as a description of radio announcer [[Martin Block]], the first radio announcer to gain widespread fame for playing popular recorded music over the air.&lt;ref name=Fisher&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher | first = Marc | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Something in the Air | publisher = Random House | date = | location = | pages = 11| url = | doi = | isbn = 978-0-375-50907-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1943, radio DJ [[Jimmy Savile]] launched the world's first DJ dance party by playing [[jazz]] records in the upstairs function room of the [[Loyal Order of Ancient Shepherds]] in [[Otley]], [[England]]. In 1947, he claims to have become the first DJ to use twin turntables for continuous play, and in 1958 became a radio DJ at [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Day Belongs To The Local Hero|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19830912&amp;id=iPU9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=CUkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2175,2128192|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=The Glasgow Herald|date=12 September 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1947, the Whiskey à Go-Go nightclub opened in [[Paris, France]], considered to be the world's first commercial discothèque, or disco (deriving its name from the French word meaning a nightclub where the featured entertainment is recorded music rather than an on-stage band). [[Régine Zylberberg|Regine]] began playing on twin turntables there in 1953. Discos began appearing across Europe and the United States.

In the 1950s, American radio DJs would appear live at [[Sock hop|sock hops]] and "platter parties" and assume the role of a human jukebox. They would usually play 45-rpm records, featuring hit singles on one turntable while talking between songs. In some cases, a live drummer was hired to play beats between songs to maintain the dance floor. In 1955, [[Bob Casey (DJ)|Bob Casey]], a well-known "sock hop" DJ, brought the two-turntable system to the U.S. 

In the late 1950s, [[Reggae sound system|sound system]]s, a new form of public entertainment, were developed in the [[ghetto]]s of [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Promoters, who called themselves DJs, would throw large parties in the streets that centered on the disc jockey, called the "selector," who played dance music from large, loud [[PA systems]] and bantered over the music with a boastful, rhythmic chanting style called "[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]". These parties quickly became profitable for the promoters, who would sell admission, food, and alcohol, leading to fierce competition between DJs for the biggest sound systems and newest records.

==1960s and 1970s==
In the mid-1960s, nightclubs and discothèques continued to grow in Europe and the United States. Specialized DJ equipment, such as [[Rudy Bozak]]'s classic CMA-10-2DL mixer, began to appear on the market. In 1969, American club DJ [[Francis Grasso]] popularized beatmatching at [[New York City|New York]]'s Sanctuary nightclub. Beatmatching is the technique of creating seamless transitions between records with ''matching'' ''beats'', or tempos. Grasso also developed [[slip-cueing|slip-cuing]], the technique of holding a record still while the turntable is revolving underneath, releasing it at the desired moment to create a sudden transition from the previous record. (This technique had long been used in radio.)

By 1968, the number of dance clubs started to decline; most American clubs either closed or were transformed into clubs featuring live bands. Neighborhood block parties that were modelled after Jamaican sound systems gained popularity in Europe and in the [[borough]]s of [[New York City]].

In 1973, [[Jamaica|Jamaican-born]] [[DJ Kool Herc]], widely regarded as the "father of [[hip-hop culture]]," performed at block parties in his [[The Bronx|Bronx]] neighborhood and developed a technique of mixing back and forth between two identical records to extend the rhythmic instrumental segment, or ''[[break (music)|break]]''. Turntablism, the art of using turntables not only to play music but to manipulate sound and create original music, began to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Turntable Teaching .Berklee College Offers Course On Scratching.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&amp;dat=20040218&amp;id=lghHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=kfMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3334,3014916|accessdate=29 December 2013|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston)|Sun Journal]]|date=18 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] released the first [[Technics SL-1200|SL-1200]] turntable, which evolved into the SL-1200 MK2 in 1979—which, as of the early-2010s, remains an industry standard for DJing. In 1974, German [[electronic music]] band [[Kraftwerk]] released the 22-minute song "[[Autobahn (song)|Autobahn]]," which takes up the entire first side of [[Autobahn (album)|the album of the same title]]. Years later, Kraftwerk would become a significant influence on [[hip hop music|hip-hop]] artists such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and [[house music]] pioneer [[Frankie Knuckles]]. During the mid-1970s, [[Hip hop music|Hip-hop music]] and culture began to emerge, originating among urban [[African American]]s and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinos]] in New York City. The four main elements of [[hip hop|Hip Hop culture]] are [[graffiti]], DJing, [[b-boying]], and [[Rapping|MCing (rapping)]].

In the mid-1970s, the soul-funk blend of dance pop known as disco took off in the mainstream pop charts in the [[United States]] and [[Europe]], causing discothèques to experience a rebirth. Unlike many late-1960s clubs, which featured live bands, discothèques used the DJ's selection and mixing of records as the entertainment. In 1975, [[record pool]]s began, providing disc jockeys access to newer music from the industry in an efficient method.

In 1975,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rane.com/dj/gwtheo.html Rane.com]&lt;/ref&gt; hip-hop DJ [[Grand Wizard Theodore]] invented the scratching technique by accident. In 1976, American DJ, editor, and producer [[Walter Gibbons]] remixed "Ten Percent" by [[Double Exposure (band)|Double Exposure]], one of the earliest commercially released 12&amp;Prime; singles (a.k.a. "maxi-single"). In 1979, the [[Sugar Hill Gang]] released "[[Rapper's Delight]]", the first hip-hop record to become a hit.

In 1977, [[Saratoga Springs, NY]] disc jockey Tom L. Lewis introduced the Disco Bible (later renamed Disco Beats), which published hit disco songs listed by beats per minute (tempo), as well as by either artist or song title. Billboard ran an article on the new publication, and it went national relatively quickly. The list made it easier for beginning DJs to learn how to create seamless transitions between songs without dancers having to change their rhythm on the dance floor. Today, DJs can find the beats per minute of songs in the BPM List.

==1980s==
In 1981, the cable television network [[MTV]] was launched, originally devoted to music videos, especially popular rock music. The term "[[video jockey]]", or VJ, was used to describe the fresh-faced youth who introduced the music videos. In 1982, the demise of disco in the mainstream by the summer of 1982 forced many nightclubs to either close or change entertainment styles, such as by providing MTV-style video dancing or live bands. Released in 1982, the song "Planet Rock" by DJ [[Afrika Bambaataa]] was the first hip-hop song to feature [[synthesizer]]s. The song melded [[Electro music|electro]] hip-hop beats influenced by [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]] with the melody from Kraftwerk's "Trans-Europe Express." In 1982, the [[Compact Disc]] reached the public market in Asia, and early the following year in other markets. This event is often seen as the "Big Bang" of the [[digital audio]] revolution.

In the early 1980s, NYC disco DJ [[Larry Levan]], known for his electric mixes, gained a cult following, and the [[Paradise Garage]], the nightclub at which he spun, became the prototype for the modern dance club where the music and the DJ were showcased. Around the same time, the disco-influenced electronic style of dance music called [[house music]] emerged in Chicago. The name was derived from the [[Warehouse Club]] in [[Chicago]], where resident DJ [[Frankie Knuckles]] mixed old disco classics and Eurosynth pop. House music is essentially disco music with electronic drum machine beats. The common element of most house music is a 4/4 beat generated by a [[drum machine]] or other electronic means (such as a sampler), together with a solid (usually also electronically generated) synth [[bassline]]. In 1983, [[Jesse Saunders]] released what some consider the first house music track, "On &amp; On." The mid-1980s also saw the emergence of [[New York house|New York Garage]], a house music hybrid that was inspired by Levan's style and sometimes eschewed the accentuated high-hats of the [[Chicago house]] sound.

During the mid-1980s, [[techno music]] emerged from the [[Detroit]] club scene. Being geographically located between Chicago and New York, Detroit techno artists combined elements of Chicago house and New York garage along with European imports. Techno distanced itself from disco's roots by becoming almost purely electronic with synthesized beats. In 1985, the Winter Music Conference started in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] Florida and became the premier electronic music conference for dance music disc jockeys.

In 1985, TRAX Dance Music Guide was launched by American Record Pool in Beverly Hills. It was the first national DJ-published music magazine, created on the [[Macintosh]] computer using extensive music market research and early desktop publishing tools. In 1986, "[[Walk This Way]]", a rap/rock collaboration by [[Run DMC]] and [[Aerosmith]], became the first hip-hop song to reach the Top 10 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. This song was the first exposure of hip-hop music, as well as the concept of the disc jockey as band member and artist, to many mainstream audiences. In 1988, ''DJ Times'' magazine was first published. It was the first US-based magazine specifically geared toward the professional mobile and club DJ.

==1990s==
During the early 1990s, the rave scene built on the [[acid house]] scene. The rave scene changed dance music, the image of DJs, and the nature of promoting. The innovative marketing surrounding the rave scene created the first [[superstar]] DJs who established marketable "brands" around their names and sound. Some of these celebrity DJs toured around the world and were able to branch out into other music-related activities. During the early 1990s, the Compact Disc surpassed the gramophone record in popularity, but gramophone records continued to be made (although in very limited quantities) into the 21st century—particularly for club DJs and for local acts recording on small regional labels.

In 1991, ''Mobile Beat'' magazine, geared specifically toward mobile DJs, began publishing. In 1992, the [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] released the MPEG-1 standard, designed to produce reasonable sound at low bit rates. The lossy compression scheme MPEG-1 Layer-3, popularly known as [[MP3]], later revolutionized the digital music domain. In 1993, the first [[internet]] "radio station", Internet Talk Radio, was developed by [[Carl Malamud]]. Because the audio was relayed over the internet, it was possible to access internet radio stations from anywhere in the world. This made it a popular service for both amateur and professional disc jockeys operating from a personal computer.

[[File:DJ performing with Danny Brown 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|DJ performing with [[Danny Brown (rapper)|Danny Brown]] in 2014]]

In 1998, the first MP3 digital audio player was released, the Eiger Labs MPMan F10. [[Final Scratch]] debuted at the BE Developer Conference, marking the first digital DJ system to allow DJs control of MP3 files through special time-coded [[vinyl record]]s or CDs. While it would take sometime for this novel concept to catch on with the "die hard Vinyl DJs", This would soon become the first step in the new Digital DJ revolution. Manufacturers joined with computer DJing pioneers to offer professional endorsements, the first being Professor Jam (a.k.a. William P. Rader), who went on to develop the industry's first dedicated computer DJ convention and learning program, the "CPS (Computerized Performance System) DJ Summit", to help spread the word about the advantages of this emerging technology.

In 1998, Nathan Burton (England) started using Computers to Dj instead of vinyls using the popular mpeg3 format at the time.

In 1999, [[Shawn Fanning]] released [[Napster]], the first of the massively popular [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] systems. During this period, the AVLA (Audio Video Licensing Agency) of Canada announced an MP3 DJing license, administered by the Canadian Recording Industry Association. This meant that DJs could apply for a license giving them the right to perform publicly using music stored on a hard drive, instead of having to cart their whole CD collections around to their gigs.

==2000s==
At the start of the new century, the introduction of advances in technology made it possible for new sounds to be developed. The introduction of the Pioneer SVM-1000 Audio and Video Mixer and other high tech digital sound mixers made a whole new culture of disco DJ integration. The proliferation of Internet technologies have also created a culture of disc jockey enthusiast groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeromagnitude.com/|title=ZeroMagnitude - Professional DJs Extreme Remixes|work=ZeroMagnitude}}&lt;/ref&gt; DJ battles imitating the events on the game gave the DJ industry a more competitive phase. The DJ industry has become increasingly about the atmosphere that goes along with a performance. Now not only does the DJ show deal with music and mixing but also lights and effect go along with it.

'''Idea networking''' is a qualitative method of doing a [[cluster analysis]] of any collection of statements, developed by Mike Metcalfe at the [[University of South Australia]].&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"&gt;{{cite book |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=2014 |chapter=Idea networking |title=How concepts solve management problems |location=Cheltenham, UK |publisher=[[Edward Elgar Publishing]] |pages=62–74 |isbn=9781783471072 |oclc=868380268 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuJnAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Networking lists of statements acts to reduce them into a handful of clusters or categories. The statements might be source from interviews, text, web sites, [[focus group]]s, [[SWOT analysis]] or community consultation. Idea networking is [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] as it does not assume any prior classification system to cluster the statements. Rather keywords or issues in the statements are individually linked (paired). These links can then be entered into network software to be displayed as a network with clusters. When named, these clusters provide emergent categories, meta themes, frames or concepts which represent, structure or sense-make the collection of statements.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

==Method==
An idea network can be constructed in the following way:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;
* 60 to 200 statements are listed and assigned reference numbers. 
* A table is constructed showing which statements (by reference number) are linked (paired) and why. For example, statement 1 maybe linked to statements 4, 23, 45, 67, 89 and 107 because they all are about the weather (see table). 
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Statement !! Is Linked To !! Because They Are About
|-
| 1 || 4, 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Weather
|-
| 2 || 16, 29, 46, 81 || Light
|-
| 3 || 23, 45, 67, 89, 107 || Interaction
|-
| 4 || 13, 16, 34, 78, 81 || Weather
|-
| Etc. || Etc. || Etc.
|}

The number of links per statement should be from 1 to 7; many more will result in a congested network diagram. This means choosing why the statements are linked may need grading as strong or weak, or by sub sets. For example, statements linked as being about weather conditions may be further subdivided into those about good weather, wet weather or bad weather, etc.). This linking is sometimes called 'coding' in thematic analysis which highlights that the statements can be linked for several and different reasons (source, context, time, etc.). There maybe many tens of reasons why statements are linked. The same statements may be linked for different reasons. The number of reasons should not be restricted to low number as so anticipate the resultant clustering. 
*The reference numbers are inputed to a network diagramming software, usually in the form of a matrix with the reference numbers along the top and side of the matrix. Each cell will then have a 1 or 0 to indicate whether its row and column reference number are linked. 
*The software is instructed to draw network diagram using maximum node repulsion. This encourages cluster formation.  Around 5 clusters are identified in the network diagram, both visually and using the cluster identification algorithms supplied with the software (e.g. Newnan Girvan sub-groups) 
[[File:Idea Networking Example.jpg|thumb|Idea Network]]
*A descriptive collective adjective name is determined for each cluster of statements (a meta narrative, classification name or label). 
*The list of statements is then reported as being clustered into these five or so cluster names (themes, frames, concepts). For example, one might report that your analysis of the statements shows that those at community meeting were using the concepts of exposure, interaction, safety, light and inspiration in their responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metcalfe |first=Mike |date=April 2007 |title=Problem conceptualisation using idea networks |journal=Systemic Practice and Action Research |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=141–150 |doi=10.1007/s11213-006-9056-y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Underlying philosophy ==
In his book ''[[Notes on the Synthesis of Form]]'', the pragmatist [[Christopher Alexander]] suggested networking the ideas of clients as means to identifying the major facets of an architectural design.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt; This is still used modern design work usually using [[cluster analysis]]. Modern [[social network analysis software]] provides a useful tool for how these ideas can be networked. 
This simply adds ideas to the list of computers, power stations, people and events that can be networked (see [[Network theory]]).&lt;ref name="socialcapitalnetknowtransfer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Inkpen |first1=Andrew C. |last2=Tsang |first2=Eric W. K. |date=January 2005 |title=Social capital, networks, and knowledge transfer |journal=[[Academy of Management Review]] |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=146–165 |doi=10.5465/AMR.2005.15281445 |jstor=20159100}}&lt;/ref&gt; The links between ideas can be represented in a matrix or network. Modern network diagramming software, with node repulsion algorithms, allows useful visual representation of these networks revealing clusters of nodes.

When networking peoples' statements or ideas, these become the nodes and the links are provided by an analyst linking those statements thought to be similar. Keywords, synonyms, experience or context might be used to provide this linking. For example, the statements: (1) "That war is economics progressed by other means, might be considered linked to the statement"; (2) "That progress unfortunately needs the innovation which is a consequence of human conflict". 
 
Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues we use our conceptions to interpret our perceptions (sensory inputs).&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|18}} These conceptions might be represented by words as conceptual ideas or concepts. For example, if we use the conceptual idea or concepts of justice to interpret the actions of people, we get a different interpretation (or meaning) compared to using the conceptual idea of personal power. Using the conceptual idea of justice makes certain action ideas seem reasonable. These may include due process, legal representation, hearing both sides, have norms or regulations for comparison. Therefore, there is a relationship between conceptual ideas and related apparently rational action ideas.

If the statements gathered at a consultative meeting are considered action ideas, then clusters of these similar actions ideas might be considered to examples of a meta idea or conceptual idea. These are also called themes, and frames. Modern research extending Miller's Magic number 7 plus or minus 2, to idea handling, suggests a five-part classification is appropriate for humans.&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;{{rp|145}}

==Notable applications and uses==

Using networking to cluster statements is considered useful because:&lt;ref name="Metcalfe"/&gt;

*It provides a multi-dimensional alternative to [[post-it note]]s in clusters.
*It offers a convenient graphic which can be presented in reports and analysed using network metrics (See [[Computer assisted qualitative data analysis software]]). 
*It is an auditable process where each step taken can be explained in supporting documentation.
*It is a qualitative alternative, and thus more subtle and transparent, than [[NVivo]], [[thematic analysis]], [[cluster analysis]], [[factor analysis]], [[multidimensional scaling]] or [[principal component analysis]]. This subtleness includes enabling the analyst to deal with metaphor, synonyms, pronouns and alternative terminology generally. No variables (variation in numerical data) are necessary.

In [[linguistics]], '''information structure''', also called information packaging, describes the way in which information is formally packaged within a sentence.&lt;ref name="lambrecht"&gt;Lambrecht, Knud. 1994. ''Information structure and sentence form.'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This generally includes only those aspects of information that “respond to the temporary state of the addressee’s mind”, and excludes other aspects of linguistic information such as references to background (encyclopedic/common) knowledge, choice of style, [[politeness]], and so forth.&lt;ref name="krifka"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Krifka|first=Manfred|authorlink=Manfred Krifka|title=Basic notions of information structure|journal=Acta Linguistica Hungarica|volume=55|issue=3–4|pages=243–276|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|location=Budapest|year=2008|issn=1216-8076|doi=10.1556/ALing.55.2008.3-4.2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the difference between an active clause (e.g., ''the police want him'') and a corresponding passive (e.g., ''he is wanted by police'') is a syntactic difference, but one motivated by information structuring considerations. Other structures motivated by information structure include preposing (e.g., ''that one I don't like'') and inversion (e.g., ''"the end", said the man'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huddleston|first1=Rodney|last2=Pullum|first2=Geoff K|title=The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language|date=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic notions of information structure are [[focus (linguistics)|focus]], [[givenness]], and [[topic-comment|topic]],&lt;ref name="krifka"/&gt; as well as their complementary notions of background, newness, and comment respectively.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kučerová|first1=Ivona|last2=Neeleman|first2=Ad|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|title=Contrasts and positions in information structure|location=[[Cambridge]]|year=2012|pages=1–23|isbn=978-1-107-00198-5|url=http://www.cambridge.org/9781107001985}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Focus''' “indicates the presence of alternatives that are relevant for the interpretation of linguistic expressions”, '''givenness''' indicates that “the denotation of an expression is present” in the immediate context of the utterance, and '''topic''' is “the entity that a speaker identifies, about which then information, the comment, is given”.&lt;ref name="krifka"/&gt; Additional notions in information structure may include contrast and exhaustivity, but there is no general agreement in the linguistic literature about extensions of the basic three notions.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"/&gt; There are many different approaches, such as generative or functional architectures, to information structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

== Mechanisms in various languages ==
Information structure can be realized through a wide variety of linguistic mechanisms.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman" /&gt; In the spoken form of [[English language|English Language]], one of the primary methods of indicating information structure is through [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], whereby [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is modified from some default pattern. Other languages use syntactic mechanisms like [[dislocation (syntax)|dislocation]], [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]], and [[gapping]]; morphological mechanisms like specialized focus or topic-marking [[affix]]es; and specialized [[discourse particle]]s. English in fact uses more than intonation for expressing information structure, so that [[cleft sentence|clefts]] are used for exhaustive focus, and [[grammatical particle]]s like ''only'' also induce contrastive focus readings.

Cross-linguistically, there are clear tendencies that relate notions of information structure to particular linguistic phenomena. For instance, focus tends to be [[prosody (linguistics)|prosodically]] prominent, and there do not seem to be any languages that express focus by [[metrical phonology|deaccenting]] or destressing.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman" /&gt;

The following German sentences exhibit three different kinds of syntactic ‘fronting’ that correlate with topic.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"/&gt;

: a. _Diesen Mann_ habe ich noch nie gesehen.
: ‘This man have I not yet seen.’ '''(movement)'''
b. _Diesen Mann_, den habe ich noch nie gesehen.
: ‘This man, that I have not yet seen.’ '''(left dislocation)'''
: c. _Diesen Mann_, ich habe ihn noch nie gesehen.
: ‘This man, I have not yet seen him.’ '''(hanging topic)'''

It is often assumed that answers to questions are focused elements. Question and answer pairs are often used as diagnostics for focus, as in the following English examples.&lt;ref name="kučerová-neeleman"/&gt;

:Q: What did John do with the book yesterday?
:A: He SOLD the book yesterday.
:A: *He sold the book YESTERDAY.

:Q: When did Jane sell the book?
:A: She sold the book YESTERDAY.
:A: *She SOLD the book yesterday.

== Concepts ==

=== Focus and background ===
{{Main|Focus (linguistics)}}
''Focus'' is a grammatical category or attribute that determines indicating that part of an utterance contributes new, non-derivable, or contrastive information.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Notes on transitivity and theme in English: Part 2|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S0022226700016613|accessdate = 2015-07-08|last = Halliday|first = M. A. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some theories (in line with work by Mats Rooth) link focus to the presence of ''alternatives'' (see [[Focus (linguistics)#Alternative semantics|Focus: Alternative Semantics]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A theory of focus interpretation|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02342617|journal = Natural Language Semantics|date = 1992|issn = 0925-854X|pages = 75–116|volume = 1|issue = 1|doi = 10.1007/BF02342617|first = Mats|last = Rooth}}&lt;/ref&gt; An alternatives theory of focus would account for the stress pattern in the example from the previous section (When did Jane sell the book? She sold the book YESTERDAY), saying that YESTERDAY receives focus because it could be substituted with alternative time periods (TODAY or LAST WEEK) and still serve to answer the question the first speaker asked.

''Background'' is a more difficult concept to define; it's not simply the complement of focus. Daniel P. Hole gives the following framework: "‘Focus’ is a relational notion, and the entity a focus relates to is called its background, or presupposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Focus and Background Marking in Mandarin Chinese: System and theory behind cái, jiù, dōu and ye.|url = http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/ilg/institut/mitarbeiter/hole/schriften/Hole2004a.pdf|website = www.uni-stuttgart.de|accessdate = 2015-07-15|last = Hole|first = Daniel P.|date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Topic and comment ===
{{Main|Topic and comment}}
The ''topic'' (or theme) of a sentence is what is being talked about, and the ''comment'' (or rheme, or sometimes focus) is what is being said about the topic. That the information structure of a clause is divided in this way is generally agreed on, but the boundary between topic/theme depends on grammatical theory. Topic is grammaticized in languages like Japanese and Korean, which have a designated [[Topic marker|topic-marker]] morpheme affixed to the topic.

Some diagnostics have been proposed for languages that lack grammatical topic-markers, like English; they attempt to distinguish between different kinds of topics (such as "aboutness" topics and "contrastive" topics).&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Craige (2001). "Topics". In ''Semantics: An international handbook of natural language meaning''. Vol. 33. (Eds. Claudia Maienborn, Klaus von Heusinger, and Paul Portner). Walter de Gruyter. pp.1908-1934.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagnostics consist of judging how felicitous it is to follow a discourse with either questions (''What about x?'') or sentences beginning with certain phrases (''About x, ... Speaking of x,'' ... ''As for x'', ...) to determine how "topical" ''x'' is in that context.

=== Given and new ===
Intuitively, ''givenness'' classifies words and information in a discourse that are already known (or given) by virtue of being common knowledge, or by having been discussed previously in the same discourse ("anaphorically recoverable").&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Certain theories (such as Roger Schwarzschild's GIVENness Constraint) require all non-focus-marked constituents to be given.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = GIVENNESS, AVOIDF AND OTHER CONSTRAINTS ON THE PLACEMENT OF ACCENT*|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A%3A1008370902407|journal = Natural Language Semantics|date = 1999|issn = 0925-854X|pages = 141–177|volume = 7|issue = 2|doi = 10.1023/A:1008370902407|first = Roger|last = Schwarzschild}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Words/information that are not given, or are "textually and situationally non-derivable"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; are by definition ''new''.

'''Promundo''' is a [[Brazil]]ian-based, non-governmental organization with offices in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, [[Goma]], Democratic Republic of the Congo, and [[Washington, DC]], USA, that work in collaboration to promote caring, non-violent and equitable [[masculinities]] and gender relations in Brazil and internationally. Promundo's work engages women, girls, boys and men; strives to transform [[gender norms]] and power relations within key institutions; and is based on building local and international partnerships.  It is an [[applied research]] institute that works to test, evaluate and advocate for policies and programs that transform masculinities.

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
Founded in 1997, Promundo was born out of frustration with the prevailing discourses about [[gender equality]] and efforts to put those discourses into action, practice and [[policy]]. The institute has concentrated on developing evaluated interventions and advocacy strategies to achieve gender equality with a focus on engaging men and boys in changing inequitable and violent forms of masculinities.
 
Promundo works locally, nationally, and internationally to:
*Conduct research to build the knowledge base on masculinities and gender equality;
*Develop, evaluate and scale up gender transformative interventions and policies;
*Carry out national and international advocacy to achieve gender equality and social justice.

Promundo designs, implements, and evaluates its research and evidence-based programs in close partnership with local, not-for-profit [[Civil society|Civil Society Organizations]]. In recent years, Promundo has been increasingly recognized for promoting the role of men and boys in achieving gender equality. Most recently, Promundo expanded its presence to Washington, DC, to support the organization’s international communication, advocacy and technical assistance, which include the coordination of the [http://www.menengage.org/ MenEngage Alliance], a global network of NGOs and UN partners working to engage men and boys in gender equality, of which Promundo was a co-founder.

==Main Programs and Activities==

===Program H===
In 1999 Promundo, together with [http://www.ecos.org.br/index2.asp ECOS Comunicação em Sexualidade] ([[São Paulo]], Brazil), [http://www.papai.org.br/ Instituto Papai] ([[Recife]], Brazil), and [http://www.saludygenero.org.mx/ Salud y Género] ([[Mexico]]), with support from the [[Pan American Health Organization|Pan American Health Organization (PAHO)]], the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]], [http://www.ippfwhr.org/ International Planned Parenthood Federation/Western Hemisphere Region (IPPF/WHR)], [http://www.johnsnow.com.br/ JohnSnowBrasil] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20110804001045/http://www.rb.com/home Durex – SSL International] developed the Program H (H for {{lang-pt|Homens}} and {{lang-es|Hombres}}, the words for Men).&lt;ref name="Programs H and M"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.promundo.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/OPASINGLES_WEB.pdf | title=Program H and Program M: Engaging Young Men and Empowering Young Women to Promote Gender Equality and Health | publisher=Promundo | date=October 2010 | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The material was born in part of extensive community-based research, including the study ''Dying to be Men: Youth, Masculinity and Social Exclusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Dying To Be Men: Youth, Masculinity and Social Exclusion |last=Barker |first=Gary Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis |location=Abingdon, New York |isbn=0-415-33774-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Program H seeks to engage young men and their communities in critical reflections about rigid norms related to manhood.  It includes group educational activities, community campaigns, and an innovative evaluation model, called Gender-Equitable Men or GEM scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=http://www.promundo.org.br/en/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/Evolving-Men-IMAGES-1.pdf | first1=Gary | last1=Barker | authorlink= | first2= | last2=et alii | title=Evolving Men: Initial Results from the International Men and Gender Equality Survey (IMAGES) | edição= | place=Washington, D.C. and Rio de Janeiro | publisher=International Center for Research on Women (ICRW) and Instituto Promundo | editor= | year=2011 | pages= | volume= | page= | chapter= | isbn= | accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; for assessing the program’s impact on gender-related attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Pulerwitz | first1=Julie | last2=Barker | first2=Gary | date=April 2008 | title=Measuring Attitudes toward Gender Norms among Young Men in Brazil: Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the GEM Scale | journal=Men and Masculinities | volume=10 | issue=3 | pages=322–338 | publisher=Sage Publications | doi= 10.1177/1097184x06298778| url=http://promundo.org.br/en/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/04.pdf | issn=1097-184X | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach was subjected to quasi-experimental impact evaluation studies in Brazil, [[India]], [[Balkans|the Balkans]] and several settings in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Barker | first1=Gary | authorlink= | last2=Ricardo | first2=Christine | date=June 2005 | title=Young Men and the Construction of Masculinity in Sub-Saharan Africa: Implications for HIV/AIDS, Conflict, and Violence | journal=Social Development Papers | volume= | issue=26 | pages= | publisher=The World Bank | place=Washington, D.C. | issn= | url=http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/WDSP/IB/2005/06/23/000012009_20050623134235/Rendered/PDF/327120rev0PAPER0AFR0young0men0WP26.pdf | accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and found to lead to significant changes in attitudes among young men, in addition to self-reported increases in condom use, increased in couple communication and reductions in men’s reports of use of violence against female partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iOTzpHXgIo4C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=sandy+ruxton+gender+equality+and+men&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=c5aLKM6qfY&amp;sig=b3t-zZil6dns-NxN-TYjtdssfwo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6nioTq2hMI7NtgehhcEM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | first1=Gary | last1=Barker |authorlink= | first2= | last2=et alii | title=Gender Equality and Men: Learning from Practice | place=Oxford | publisher=Oxfam | editor1-first=Sandy | editor1-last=Ruxton | year=2004 | pages=147–161 | chapter=How Do We Know If We Have Changed?

===Program M===
In 1999 Promundo in partnership with [http://www.ecos.org.br/index2.asp Ecos] (São Paulo), Instituto Papai (Recife), Salud y Género (Mexico) and [http://www.worlded.org/WEIInternet/ World Education] (United States), with the support of the [http://www.oakfnd.org/ Oak Foundation], the [http://www.macfound.org/site/c.lkLXJ8MQKrH/b.3599935/k.1648/John_D__Catherine_T_MacArthur_Foundation.htm MacArthur Foundation], the [http://www.nikefoundation.org/ Nike Foundation] and the [http://www.sepm.gov.br/ Brazilian Secretariat for Women’s Policies] developed Program M (M for {{lang-pt|Mulheres}} and {{lang-es|Mujeres}}, the words for Women).&lt;ref name="Programs H and M"/&gt;

Program M seeks to promote the health and empowerment of young women through critical reflections about gender, rights and health. It consists of educational workshops, community campaigns and innovative evaluation instruments for assessing the program’s impact on young women’s gender-related attitudes and perceived self-efficacy in interpersonal relationships.

===White Ribbon Campaign===
In 2000 Promundo, Instituto Papai and other partner organizations launched the [[White Ribbon Campaign]] in Brazil. Promundo also works together [http://www.noos.org.br/portal/index.php Instituto Noos] and the [http://www.rj.gov.br/web/guest;jsessionid=9E5B7AACE66D1FBCB1A9B1E678098122.lportal3 State Government of Rio de Janeiro] to start one of Brazil’s first batterer intervention programs, which eventually inspired the Brazilian Federal Government to implement such programs in other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people= | date=October 22, 2011 |title=A cada hora, cem mulheres são agredidas | url=http://www.band.com.br/jornaldaband/conteudo.asp?ID=100000463790 |format= |medium=Television production |language=Portuguese |trans-title=| publisher=Jornal da Band | location=Rio de Janeiro, Brazil | accessdate=November 7, 2011 | time= | id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video Against Homophobia===
Because attitudes towards homophobia showed the least amount of attitude change in the study impact evaluation in Brazil, in 2005 Promundo, Ecos, Salud y Género, Papai and the other Program H partners, with support from the [http://www.aids.gov.br/ Brazilian National AIDS Programme], developed a cartoon video called ''Afraid of What?''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= |date=2005 |title=Medo de quê? |url=http://www.promundo.org.br/audiovisuais/para-jovens-e-adultos/dvd-medo-de-que/ |format=VHS, DVD |medium=cartoon |language= |trans-title=Afraid of What? |publisher=Promundo |location=Brazil |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007172851/http://www.promundo.org.br/audiovisuais/para-jovens-e-adultos/dvd-medo-de-que/|archivedate=2010-10-07|accessdate=July 22, 2011 |time= |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote= |dead-url=yes|ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a complementary educational tool focusing specifically on the issue of homophobia, and targeting mostly heterosexual youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.promundo.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Guia-medo-dvd-ingles.pdf | title=Afraid of What? | publisher=Promundo | accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global Symposium on Engaging Men and Boys in Gender Equality===
Between March 30 and April 3, 2009, Promundo and partners co-hosted the ''Global Symposium on Engaging Men and Boys in Gender Equality'' in Rio de Janeiro. The event brought together 439 activists, researchers, and practitioners from 77 countries to share their experiences in challenging rigid gender norms and engaging men and boys in: reducing violence against women and girls; promoting sexual and reproductive health; HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment; and fatherhood and care-giving. The event was organized in collaboration with the MenEngage Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=

For clarifications about the [[Global intellectual history|latter topic]], please consult the writings of the [[Intellectual history#Prominent individuals|intellectual historians listed here]] and entries on individual thinkers.}}

'''Intellectual history''' refers to the [[historiography]] of ideas and thinkers.  This [[history]] cannot be considered without the knowledge of the humans who created, discussed, wrote about, and in other ways were concerned with ideas. Intellectual history as practiced by [[historian]]s is parallel to the [[history of philosophy]] as done by philosophers, and is more akin to the [[history of ideas]]. Its central premise is that ideas do not develop in isolation from the people who create and use them, and that one must study ideas not as abstract propositions but in terms of the culture, lives, and historical contexts that produced them.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Grafton, "The history of ideas: Precept and practice, 1950-2000 and beyond." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 67#1 (2006): 1-32. [http://sydney.edu.au/intellectual-history/documents/grafton-history-ideas.pdf online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history aims to understand ideas from the past by understanding them in context. The term "context" in the preceding sentence is ambiguous: it can be political, cultural, intellectual, and social. One can read a text both in terms of a chronological context (for example, as a contribution to a discipline or tradition as it extended over time) or in terms of a contemporary intellectual moment (for example, as participating in a debate particular to a certain time and place). Both of these acts of contextualization are typical of what intellectual historians do, nor are they exclusive. Generally speaking, intellectual historians seek to place concepts and texts from the past in multiple contexts.

It is important to realize that intellectual history is not just the history of intellectuals. It studies ideas as they are expressed in texts, and as such is different from other forms of [[cultural history]] which deal also with visual and other non-verbal forms of evidence. Any written trace from the past can be the object of intellectual history. The concept of the "[[intellectual]]" is relatively recent, and suggests someone professionally concerned with thought. Instead, anyone who has put pen to paper to explore his or her thoughts can be the object of intellectual history. A famous example of an intellectual history of a non-canonical thinker is [[Carlo Ginzburg]]'s study of a 16th-century Italian miller, [[Menocchio]], in his seminal work ''The Cheese and the Worms''.

Although the field emerged from European disciplines of ''[[Kulturgeschichte]]'' and ''[[Geistesgeschichte]]'', the historical study of ideas has engaged not only western intellectual traditions but others as well, including those in other parts of the world. Increasingly, historians are calling for a [[Global intellectual history]] that will show the parallels and interrelations in the history of thought of all human societies. Another important trend has been the [[history of the book]] and of reading, which has drawn attention to the material aspects of how books were designed, produced, distributed, and read.

==Intellectual historiography==
Intellectual history as a self-conscious discipline is a relatively recent phenomenon. It has precedents, however, in the [[history of philosophy]], the [[history of ideas]], and in [[cultural history]] as practiced since [[Jacob Burckhardt|Burckhardt]] or indeed since [[Voltaire]]. The history of the human mind, as it was called in the eighteenth century, was of great concern to scholars and philosophers, and their efforts can in part be traced to [[Francis Bacon]]’s call for what he termed a literary history in his [[The Advancement of Learning]]. In economics, [[John Maynard Keynes]] (1883-1946) was both a historian of economic thought himself,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. [[John Maynard Keynes]], ''Essays in Biography'', Macmillan, 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject of study by historians of economic thought because of the significance of the [[Keynesian revolution]].&lt;ref&gt; E.g. [[Peter Clarke (historian)]], ''The Keynesian Revolution in the Making, 1924-1936'', 1988. [[Donald Markwell]], ''John Maynard Keynes and International Relations: Economic Paths to War and Peace'', Oxford University Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the discipline of intellectual history as it is now understood emerged only in the immediate postwar period, in its earlier incarnation as "the [[history of ideas]]" under the leadership of [[Arthur Lovejoy]], the founder of the [[Journal of the History of Ideas]]. Since that time, Lovejoy's formulation of "unit-ideas" has been discredited and replaced by more nuanced and more historically sensitive accounts of intellectual activity, and this shift is reflected in the replacement of the phrase [[history of ideas]] by ''intellectual history''.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter,  "Begriffsgeschichte and the History of Ideas." ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1987): 247-263. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2709557 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectual history includes the history of thought in many disciplines, such as the [[history of philosophy]], and the [[history of economic thought]]. Analytical concepts - such as the nature of paradigms and the causes of paradigm shifts - have been borrowed from the study of other disciplines, exemplified by the use of the ideas of [[Thomas Kuhn]] about [[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]] to explain revolutions in thought in economics and other disciplines.&lt;ref&gt; E.g. Ghanshyam Mehta, ''The structure of the Keynesian Revolution'', 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain the [[history of political thought]] has been a particular focus since the late 1960s and is associated especially with [[Cambridge School (intellectual history)|historians at Cambridge]], such as  [[John Dunn (political theorist)|John Dunn]] and [[Quentin Skinner]]. They studied European political thought in its historical context, emphasizing the emergence and development of such concepts as the state and freedom. Skinner in particular is renowned for his provocative methodological essays, which were and are widely read by philosophers and practitioners of other humanistic disciplines, and did much to give prominence to the practice of intellectual history.&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Richter, "Reconstructing the history of political languages: Pocock, Skinner, and the Geschichtliche Grundbegriffe." History and Theory (1990): 38-70. [http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/122486/bdf9f28ccd0e5fa91c1b6dae307c0eed.pdf?sequence=1 online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United States, intellectual history is understood more broadly to encompass many different forms of intellectual output, not just the history of political ideas, and it includes such fields as the history of historical thought, associated especially with [[Anthony Grafton]] of [[Princeton University]] and [[J.G.A. Pocock]] of [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Formalized in 2010, the History and Culture Ph.D. at [[Drew University]] is one of a few graduate programs in the US currently specializing in intellectual history, both in its American and European contexts. Despite the prominence of early modern intellectual historians (those studying the age from the [[Renaissance]] to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]), the intellectual history of the modern period has also been the locus of intense and creative output on both sides of the Atlantic. Prominent examples of such work include [[Louis Menand]]'s ''[[The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America|The Metaphysical Club]]'' and [[Martin Jay]]'s ''[[The Dialectical Imagination]]''.

In continental Europe, equivalents of intellectual history can be found. An example is [[Reinhart Koselleck]]’s ''Begriffsgeschichte'' (history of concepts), though there are methodological differences between the work of Koselleck and his followers and the work of Anglo-American intellectual historians.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2800">The '''International Committee for the History of Technology''' (ICOHTEC) was founded at a meeting of the International Congress on the History of Science, Technology, and Medicine&lt;ref&gt;http://www.histnet.cnrs.fr/research/sfhst/spip.php?article222&lt;/ref&gt; in Paris in the summer of 1968. Its founding was the brainchild of [[Melvin Kranzberg]], Professor of the History of Technology at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. Kranzberg had already established the [[Society for the History of Technology]] (SHOT) and its journal, ''[[Technology and Culture]]'', but he felt that in the midst of Cold War tensions, there was a need for another forum that focused on crossing the artificial borders of the Iron Curtain. For Kranzberg, the History of Technology, a new discipline not yet burdened with ideological or political freight as were other branches of history, was an ideal arena where scholars from East and West could find common ground. Kranzberg was supported in this effort by Maurice Daumas from France, Eugene Olszewski from Poland, and S.J. Schuchardine from the USSR, among others. For the past several decades, ICOHTEC's principal activity has been an ''annual meeting'',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohtec.org/annual-meeting-current.html&lt;/ref&gt;  where scholars from many countries and from many disclipines gather and share their work. Papers presented at the meetings are usually published in the Committee's annual journal ''ICON''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icohtec.org/publications-icon.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kranzberg’s vision was largely fulfilled in the meetings that followed, although exchanges among scholars were not always harmonious.  Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the breakup of the Soviet Union in the years that followed, ICOHTEC lost its original reason for being. But it has thrived in the following years and continues to have an active international membership and hold well-attended and intellectually lively meetings. One reason is the perception that its sister society, SHOT, remains somewhat biased toward U.S. membership in spite of efforts to reach out more to an international audience.
&lt;!-- 


ICOHTEC had a very successful meeting [http://www.conferences.hu/ichs09/index.htm] in Budapest, Hungary in 2009. 

In 2010 it held a joint meeting in Tampere, Finland with [[The International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage]] (TICCIH) and The International Association of the Labour Museums (WORKLAB), around the theme ‘Reusing the Industrial Past’.

{{Social teachings of the popes}}
'''''Laudato si{{'}}''''' (Medieval Central [[Italian language|Italian]] for "Praise Be to You") is the second [[encyclical]] of [[Pope Francis]]. The encyclical has the subtitle "On care for our common home".&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText" /&gt; In it, the Pope critiques [[consumerism]] and [[overdevelopment|irresponsible development]], laments [[environmental degradation]] and [[global warming]], and calls all people of the world to take "swift and unified global action."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical, dated 24 May 2015, was officially published at noon on 18 June 2015, accompanied by a news conference.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The Vatican released the document in Italian, German, English, Spanish, French, Polish, Portuguese and Arabic, alongside the original Latin.&lt;ref name=strong /&gt;

The encyclical is the second published by Francis, after ''[[Lumen fidei]]'' ("The Light of Faith"), which was released in 2013. Since ''Lumen fidei'' was largely the work of Francis's predecessor [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]], ''Laudato si{{'}}'' is generally viewed as the first encyclical that is entirely the work of Francis.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;&lt;ref name=things /&gt;

== Content ==
[[File:John Zizioulas presents the encyclical Laudato si' at the press conference in Rome.webm|thumb| [[w:John Zizioulas|John Zizioulas]],  [[w:Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]]  [[w:Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[w:Pergamon|Pergamon]], presents the encyclical ''Laudato si''' at the [[b:Development Cooperation Handbook/Interviews/Press Conference Presentation Laudato si'|Press conference]] in Rome ]]
The title of the social encyclical is an [[Central Italian|Umbrian]] phrase&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt; from Saint [[Francis of Assisi]]'s 13th-century "[[Canticle of the Sun]]" (also called the Canticle of the Creatures), a poem and prayer in which God is praised for the creation of the different creatures and aspects of the Earth.&lt;ref name=bulletin /&gt;

The tone of the Pope's phrasing has been described as "cautious and undogmatic, and he specifically calls for discussion and dialogue."&lt;ref name=good/&gt;  For example, he states in the encyclical (#188):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are certain environmental issues where it is not easy to achieve a broad consensus. Here I would state once more that the Church does not presume to settle scientific questions or to replace politics. But I am concerned to encourage an honest and open debate so that particular interests or ideologies will not prejudice the common good.&lt;ref name=good/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He adds that "Although the post-industrial period may well be remembered as one of the most irresponsible in history, nonetheless there is reason to hope that humanity at the dawn of the twenty-first century will be remembered for having generously shouldered its grave responsibilities."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Francis does state that concern for the natural world is no longer "'optional' but is an integral part of the Church teaching on social justice."&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt;

Francis reportedly has said that the encyclical was not really an environmental document at all.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  The warming of the planet is a symptom of a greater problem: the developed world's indifference to the destruction of the planet as they pursue short-term economic gains.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  This has resulted in a "[[throwaway culture]]" in which unwanted items and unwanted people, such as the unborn, the elderly, and the poor, are discarded as waste.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  This subtext makes the document "more profoundly subversive" than it appears on the surface.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

The real problem, according to Francis, lies in the fact that humans no longer see God as the [[Creator deity#Christianity|Creator]].&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  Thus we see "other living beings as mere objects subjected to arbitrary human domination" and do not realize that "the ultimate purpose of other creatures is not found in us."&lt;ref name=return/&gt; Francis says that instead of viewing humanity as having "dominion" over the earth, we must see that everything is interconnected and that all of creation is a "kind of universal family".&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; Nature cannot be seen as something apart from humanity, or merely the place where we live.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; He says that our social and environmental crises are thus one complex crisis that must be solved holistically.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt;

===Environmentalism===
Francis "pulls no punches" when lamenting pollution, [[global warming|climate change]], a lack of clean water, loss of biodiversity, and an overall decline in human life and a breakdown of society.&lt;ref name=visitor/&gt; "Never have we so hurt and mistreated our common home as we have in the last two hundred years," he states.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

He "describe[s] a relentless [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] and [[Environmental degradation|destruction]] of the environment, for which he blamed apathy, the reckless pursuit of profits, excessive faith in technology and political shortsightedness."&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; ''Laudato si''' "unambiguously accepts the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus]] that [[global warming|changes in the climate]] are largely man-made"&lt;ref name=eco /&gt; and states that "climate change is a global problem with grave implications: environmental, social, economic, political and for the distribution of goods. It represents one of the principal challenges facing humanity in our day" and warns of "unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious consequence for all of us" if prompt [[climate change mitigation]] efforts are not undertaken.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical highlights the role of [[fossil fuel]]s in causing climate change. "We know that technology based on the use of highly polluting fossil fuels – especially coal, but also oil and, to a lesser degree, gas – needs to be progressively replaced without delay," Francis says. "Until greater progress is made in developing widely accessible sources of renewable energy, it is legitimate to choose the less harmful alternative or to find short-term solutions."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  The encyclical's comments on climate change are consistent with the [[scientific consensus on climate change]].&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt;

===Poverty===
The encyclical states that [[developed nation]]s are morally obligated to assist [[developing nation]]s in combating the climate-change crisis.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; Poor nations, the pontiff says, are ill-prepared to [[Adaptation to global warming|adapt to the effects of climate change]] and will bear the brunt of its [[Effects of global warming|effects]].&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;  Linking the issues of [[poverty]], which has been a major issue in his papacy, and the environment, he insists that the world must "hear both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor."&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;

He does not believe, according to [[R. R. Reno]], that "for all our flaws, Western societies are more democratic, more egalitarian, and more inclusive than any in history."&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  Citing the New Zealand Bishops Conference ''Statement on Environmental Issues'', Francis asks "what the commandment 'Thou shall not kill' means when 'twenty percent of the world's population consumes resources at a rate that robs the poor nations and future generations of what they need to survive.'"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

===Science and modernism===
"Science and religion, with their distinctive approaches to understanding reality, can enter into an intense dialogue fruitful for both," according to the pontiff.&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Religions, including Christianity, can make "rich contributions ... towards an integral ecology and the full development of humanity,"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  However, "the scientific and experimental method" itself can be part of the problem when it decouples creation from the Creator.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

The editor of ''[[First Things]]'' R. R. Reno critiques the encyclical, writing ''Laudato si''' makes "many fierce denunciations of the current global order." This global order "destroys the environment, oppresses the multitudes, and makes us blind to the beauty of creation."&lt;ref name=return/&gt; According to Reno, the critiques of the scientific and technocratic present contained in the encyclical make this "perhaps the most anti-modern encyclical since the [[Syllabus of Errors]], [[Pope Pius IX|Pius IX's]] haughty 1864 dismissal of the conceits of the modern era."&lt;ref name=return/&gt;  He adds that the encyclical's tone lacks elements commonly found in the works of John Paul II and Benedict XVI that, in the tradition of [[Gaudium et Spes]], would have affirmed the modern world while correcting its errors.&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

===Technology===
Modern technology, the "dominant technological paradigm", is seen as a key contributor to the environmental crisis and human suffering. "The technological paradigm has become so dominant that it would be difficult to do without its resources and even more difficult to utilize them without being dominated by their internal logic. It has become countercultural to choose a lifestyle whose goals are even partly independent of technology…  Technology tends to absorb everything into its ironclad logic, and those who are surrounded with technology 'know full well that it moves forward in the final analysis neither for profit nor for the well-being of the human race.'"&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

Technology is not value neutral and technological developments are directed by the profit motive, according to Pope Francis. This is a form of institutionalized greed, generally with little regard for environmental and social consequences. "The economy accepts every advance in technology with a view to profit, without concern for its potentially negative impact on human beings".&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt; The encyclical warns against "blind confidence in technical solutions," particularly in view of the fact that "the specialization which belongs to technology makes it difficult to see the large picture," which "can actually become a form of ignorance."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt; As a result, many technological solutions are nothing more than short-term techno-fixes attempting to remove symptoms rather than addressing the underlying environmental, social, economic, and even moral and spiritual problems: "Technology, which, linked to business interests, is presented as the only way of solving these problems, in fact proves incapable of seeing the mysterious network of relations between things and so sometimes solves one problem only to create others."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

Given these significant short-comings of technology, "scientific and technological progress cannot be equated with progress of humanity and history," and we are deluded by the myth of progress to believe that "ecological problems will solve themselves simply with the application of new technology and without need for ethical consideration or deep change."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  A profound redefinition of progress and "liberation from the dominant technocratic paradigm" are needed, i.e., "we have the freedom needed to limit and direct technology; we can put it at the service of another type of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more integral."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  More fundamentally, according to the pontiff, we need to recognize that "technology severed from ethics will not easily be able to limit its own power," and that "the most extraordinary scientific advances, the most amazing technical abilities, the most astonishing economic growth, unless they are accompanied by authentic social and moral progress, will definitively turn against man."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;  Pope Francis adds that the environmental crisis can ultimately only be solved if our immense technological developments are accompanied by a "development in human responsibility, values, and conscience."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

===Other topics===

According to a ''[[New York Times]]'' summary, the encyclical is "sweeping" in scope and is wide-ranging (80 pages/45,000 words), including mentions of such topics as [[urban planning]], [[agricultural economics]], and [[biodiversity]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

The encyclical also gives voice to the Pope's opposition to [[abortion]], [[Stem cell controversy#Catholicism|embryonic stem cell research]] and [[population control]] – saying that respect for creation and human dignity go hand in hand.&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt; "Since everything is interrelated," Francis says, "concern for the protection of nature is also incompatible with the justification of abortion."&lt;ref name="TheIndependent" /&gt; According to the Pope, we can't in fact "genuinely teach the importance of concern for other vulnerable beings, however troublesome or inconvenient they may be, if we fail to protect a human embryo, even when its presence is uncomfortable and creates difficulties."&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText"/&gt;

''Laudato si''' opposes [[gender theory]] and supports "valuing one's own body in its femininity or masculinity." In acknowledging differences, the Pope states "we can joyfully accept the specific gifts of another man or woman, the work of God the Creator, and find mutual enrichment."&lt;ref name="CNA" /&gt;

===Sources===

The encyclical has 172 footnoted citations,&lt;ref name="OfficialEngText" /&gt; many to Francis's immediate predecessors, [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] and [[Pope Benedict XVI|Benedict XVI]].&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The encyclical also "draws prominently from" [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople]], the patriarch of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[Church of Constantinople]] and an ally of the pope.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;  It is highly unusual to quote an Orthodox bishop in a papal document.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  More than 10% of the footnotes, 21, cite documents from 16 bishops' conferences around the world, mostly from the [[global south]].&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;&lt;ref name=footnote /&gt;  This is the first encyclical to cite bishops' conferences.&lt;ref name=footnote /&gt;  This was an effort, experts believe, to build alliances on a controversial topic.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  The encyclical also cites Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]]; [[Ali al-Khawas]], a 9th-century [[Islamic mysticism|Sufi mystic]];&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name=mystic /&gt; [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]; and [[Romano Guardini]].&lt;ref name=Faggioli /&gt;

== History ==

=== Early stages ===
Speculation about an "environmental encyclical" to be issued by Pope Francis first began in November 2013.&lt;ref name="RoeweProgress" /&gt; On 24 January 2014, the Vatican confirmed that drafting had begun. The Rev. [[Federico Lombardi]], the [[Holy See Press Office]] director, said that the document was in its very early stages, that no publication date had been set, and that the encyclical would be about ecology (and specifically the "ecology of man").&lt;ref name="RoeweProgress" /&gt;

Cardinal [[Peter Turkson]], the president of the [[Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace]], and his team wrote the first draft of the encyclical.&lt;ref name="Kaleem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; The draft was later reviewed by several theologians as well and sent (about three weeks before the encyclical's release) to the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], the second section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], and the [[theologian of the Papal Household]].&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; Edits were made based on their responses.&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt;

In drafting the encyclical, the Vatican consulted with leading scientific experts for months.&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt; One of the experts consulted was [[Hans Joachim Schellnhuber]], the founder and head of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]].&lt;ref name="GillisScience" /&gt;

On 28 April 2015, in advance of the encyclical's release, the Vatican hosted a one-day conference on climate change, featuring Turkson, [[United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]] (who delivered the keynote address), Ecuadorian president [[Rafael Correa]] and American economist [[Jeffrey Sachs]].&lt;ref name=weight /&gt;&lt;ref name="Correa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirchgaessner" /&gt;

The title and subtitle of the encyclical were first reported on in a [[Twitter]] message by Spanish-language journalist Mercedes De La Torre on 30 May 2015.&lt;ref name=titled /&gt; The Vatican confirmed that the title would be ''Laudato si' '' on 10 June.&lt;ref name=confirms /&gt; While some initial reports said the encyclical would be called ''Laudato Sii'', this was incorrect; the pope chose to use the original Umbrian form and spelling of the poem, with a single ''i''.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;

On 4 June, the Vatican press office announced that the encyclical – which was "already attracting global attention for its expected discourses on Catholic theology on ecology, current environmental destruction, and climate change" – would be released on 18 June.&lt;ref name=released /&gt;

=== Leak ===
Four days before the encyclical's release, the Italian magazine ''[[L'Espresso]]'' posted a leaked draft of the document online.&lt;ref name="Koffler" /&gt; The leaked document "almost exactly matched" the final document.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; The leak angered [[Vatican Curia|Vatican officials]]&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; who called it a "heinous act"&lt;ref name="Koffler" /&gt; and revoked the press credentials of the longtime ''L'Espresso''  Vatican correspondent [[Sandro Magister]].&lt;ref name="Winfield" /&gt; The ''New York Times'' and the Italian newspaper ''[[La Stampa]]'' both noted suggestions that the leak came from conservatives inside the Vatican who wished to embarrass the pope and hinder the rollout of the encyclical.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Winfield" /&gt;

=== Release ===
The encyclical letter was officially released at an event in the New Synod Hall of the [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref name="VaticanRadio" /&gt; Speaking at the press conference were Turkson, Schellnhuber, and [[John Zizioulas]] (the [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Pergamon]], representing the Orthodox Church).&lt;ref name=expert /&gt; On the day of the encyclical's official release, Pope Francis issued two messages about it on his official Twitter account, @Pontifex.&lt;ref name="Kaleem" /&gt; It has been suggested that the encyclical's release was timed to influence three summits being held at the [[United Nations]] on financial aid, sustainable development and climate change later in 2015.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

== Reception ==
{{globalize|section|the English-speaking world|date=July 2015}}
After the encyclical was released, the Vatican's website was briefly inaccessible as many  people tried to read it.&lt;ref name=eco /&gt;  It has been described as "one of the shrewdest documents issued by the Vatican during the past century" and "has revealed Francis as a wily and sophisticated politician of the first order."&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;  It contains, according to [[Paul Vallely]], "a raft of defenses against critics who dismiss it as the work of some kind of left-wing maverick."&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

=== Within Roman Catholic Church ===
The [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], led by its president [[Joseph Edward Kurtz]], the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville|archbishop of Louisville]], described the encyclical as "our marching orders for advocacy"&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt; and planned briefings on the encyclical with both chambers of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and with the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=cama /&gt;  Cardinal [[Seán Patrick O'Malley|Sean O'Malley]] of Boston said that the "constant linkage throughout the encyclical of the dual need to respect and protect "Our Common Home" and the need to respect and protect the dignity and lives of the poor may be regarded as the distinctive characteristic of this powerful message of Pope Francis."&lt;ref name=omalley/&gt;

Filipino Cardinal [[Luis Antonio Tagle]], the [[Archbishop of Manila]], wrote that "In ''Laudato si''' Pope Francis reminds us to replace consumption with a sense of sacrifice, greed with generosity and wastefulness with a spirit of sharing. We must "give, and not simply give up." We are called to free ourselves from all that is heavy and negative and wasteful and to enter into dialogue with our global family."&lt;ref name=tagle/&gt;

The three bishops of Northern and Central California, [[Stephen Blaire]], [[Armando Xavier Ochoa]], and [[Jaime Soto]], issued a joint statement that highlighted how climate change disproportionately affects the poor.  "The Catholic perspective is that human and natural ecology go hand in hand," the trio said. "We are called to solidarity with the poor as well as stewardship of the Earth. Our deep regard for the dignity of every person commands us to cultivate a climate of life where each of God's children thrive and join with creation in praising our Creator. This is the 'integral ecology' of which Pope Francis speaks."&lt;ref name=bee/&gt;

Bishop [[Richard Pates]] of [[Des Moines, Iowa]], which has the first major [[Presidential Primary|presidential primary]] contest in the United States, called on candidates to show courage and leadership on the issue, saying "With presidential candidates already visiting us regularly, I encourage Catholics across our state, and all people of good will, to talk to them and ask not if, but how, they plan to work toward solutions to climate change."&lt;ref name=plates/&gt;

[[Germany|German]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hamburg|Archbishop of Hamburg]] [[Stefan Heße]] praised the encyclical, calling it "valuable momentum for a worldwide ecological reorientation." He commented further, saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;He makes it clear that urgent issues of the future for the whole world and for all human beings have to be solved. Without a radical change of mentality, it will not do. Thus he underlines that the problems that concern all can be solved only by all.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.erzbistum-hamburg.de/ebhh/layer/layer_suchergebnis.php?we_objectID=4408&amp;pid=2|title = Erzbischof würdigt Umwelt-Enzyklika des Papstes|last =|first =|date = 18 June 2015|work = Erzbistum Hamburg|language = German|trans-title = Archbishop commends environmental papal encyclical|access-date = 11 March 2016|via =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://incaelo.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/bishops-react-to-laudato-si/|title = Bishops react to Laudato si'|last = de Vries|first = Mark|date = 19 June 2015|website = In Caelo et in Terra|publisher =|access-date = 11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Vaticanology|Vaticanologist]] [[John L. Allen, Jr.]], said in an analysis, "''Laudato si''' seems destined to go down as a major turning point, the moment when environmentalism claimed pride of place on a par with the [[dignity]] of human life and [[economic justice]] as a cornerstone of [[Catholic social teaching]]. It also immediately makes the Catholic Church arguably the leading moral voice in the press to combat global warming and the consequences of climate change."&lt;ref name=earthquake /&gt;

Catholic Millennials have written widely giving their opinions of the encyclical.&lt;ref name=mil/&gt;

====Criticism====
Samuel Gregg, director of research at the libertarian [[Acton Institute]], has criticized "the sheer overreach that plagues" ''Laudato si'''.&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  [[RealClearReligion]] editor Nicholas Hahn has said that "Good Catholics can disagree on how to combat climate change and shouldn't worry about being sent to the confessional if they drive a SUV."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;

This criticism comes despite the fact that Francis took "care to locate his text firmly in the substantial body of teaching set out by previous popes," especially John Paul II and Benedict XVI, who are especially admired by conservative Catholics.&lt;ref name=vow/&gt;

=== From other faiths ===
Three days before the encyclical was released, the [[14th Dalai Lama]] issued a Twitter message stating: "Since climate change and the global economy now affect us all, we have to develop a sense of the oneness of humanity."&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;

Two days before the encyclical was released, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Justin Welby]], head of the [[Anglican Communion]], issued a "green declaration" (also signed by the [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Methodist Conference]] as well as representatives of the [[Catholic Church in England and Wales]] and the British Muslim, Sikh and Jewish communities) urging a transition to a [[low-carbon economy]] and fasting and prayer for success at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|December 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;&lt;ref name=joins /&gt;

The same day, the [[Lausanne Movement]] of global [[evangelical Christian]]s said it was anticipating the encyclical and was grateful for it.&lt;ref name="Crux" /&gt;  The encyclical was also welcomed by the [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Christian Reformed Church in North America]].&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

[[File:One Earth one family - Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action.webm|thumb|upright=1.2|Pope Francis's environmental encyclical [[w:Laudato si'|''Laudato si''']] has been welcomed by many environmental organisations of different faiths – Interfaith march in Rome to call for climate action]]

=== From world leaders ===
The [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], welcomed the encyclical in a statement on the day it was released.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;&lt;ref name=spokesman /&gt; [[Kofi Annan]], the former UN secretary-general and current chair of the [[Africa Progress Panel]], also issued a statement in support of the encyclical, stating "As Pope Francis reaffirms, climate change is an all-encompassing threat. … I applaud the Pope for his strong moral and ethical leadership. We need more of such inspired leadership. Will we see it at the climate summit in Paris?"&lt;ref name=chair /&gt;

[[Christiana Figueres]], the executive secretary of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]], said: "Pope Francis is personally committed to this issue like no other pope before him. I do think the encyclical is going to have a major impact. It will speak to the moral imperative of addressing climate change in a timely fashion in order to protect the most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="Vidal" /&gt;

On the same day, [[Jim Yong Kim]], the president of the [[World Bank Group]], also praised the encyclical.&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

=== From the scientific community ===
Science historian [[Naomi Oreskes]] observes that ''Laudato si''' "insists we embrace the moral dimensions of problems that have heretofore been viewed primarily as scientific, technological, and economic."&lt;ref name=Heald/&gt;&lt;ref name=oreskes/&gt;

The encyclical gave a boost to the [[fossil fuel divestment]] movement.&lt;ref name=schwartz /&gt;  Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, the founding director of the [[Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research]] (PIK) and chair of the [[German Advisory Council on Global Change]], who advised the Vatican on the drafting of the encyclical, said that "the science of ''Laudato si' '' is watertight" and gave the pontiff an "A" for command of the subject.&lt;ref name=expert /&gt;

An editorial in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' praised the encyclical for its statements about [[sustainability]] and global poverty and the [[energy transition|transition]] from [[fossil fuel]]s to [[renewable energy|renewable energy sources]]: "The papal calls to end poverty and share the world's ecological space in a fair way are objectives that mirror the United Nations' [[Sustainable Development Goals]], to be released in September. The Pope's letter adds an important facet to the discussion: it is not merely conceivable to secure a sound future for human civilization without relying on coal, oil and gas – it is a prerequisite."&lt;ref name=hope/&gt; However it criticized Francis for ignoring important issues like [[family planning]] and [[birth control]]. "Alas, he remained silent on issues of contraception. With a world population heading towards a possible 10 billion, the importance of family planning is clear. The Vatican has been brave on climate change. If it is serious about the fate of the planet and the welfare of its inhabitants, then it must be braver still on the issue of contraception."&lt;ref name=hope/&gt;

A review by nine climate scientists under the [[Climate Feedback]] project concluded the encyclical "rather accurately depicts the current reality of climate change" and "fairly represents the present concerns raised by the scientific community."&lt;ref name=feedback/&gt;

[[Nicholas Stern, Baron Stern of Brentford|Nicholas Stern]], chair of the [[Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment]] and author of an influential report on climate change, stated that "The publication of the Pope's encyclical is of enormous significance. He has shown great wisdom and leadership. Pope Francis is surely absolutely right that climate change raises vital moral and ethical issues.... Moral leadership on climate change from the Pope is particularly important because of the failure of many heads of state and government around the world to show political leadership."&lt;ref name="Guardian" /&gt;

{{anchor|Daly's comment}}
Leading [[Ecological economics|ecological economist]] and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]] praised the Pope's encyclical on the grounds that it "... unifies the main divisions of [[Christianity]] on at least the fundamental recognition that we have a shamefully neglected duty to care for the [[Earth]] out of which we evolved, and to share the Earth's life support more equitably with each other, with the future, and with other creatures." Daly even believes that the Pope "skates fairly close to the idea of [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state economics]]," although the important issues of population stabilization, responsible [[family planning]] and [[Birth control|contraception]] were "conspicuously near-absent" in the encyclical.&lt;ref name=Daly/&gt;

===Impact on the United States political system===
[[Stephen F. Schneck]], the director of Institute for Policy Research &amp; Catholic Studies at [[The Catholic University of America]], has said that "Something's going to come out of this and it's definitely going to have an impact on public policy in the US."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  However, Kathy Saile, the former long time director of the US bishops' office for domestic social justice, does not believe that "it will spark a climate change bill, but someday when negotiations are happening on a bill or a treaty, these kinds of moral teachings could have an influence."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt; Nonetheless, she added, "Pope Francis's tone, his honesty, how he talks about mercy and care for the poor, and his genuine desire to be a bridge," could influence political culture in Washington. "If he could change the tone of the debate, that would be an amazing gift."

[[Miami]] Archbishop [[Thomas Wenski]], chairman of the US bishops' committee on domestic peace and justice, wrote a letter to Congress letting them know that "The U.S. bishops stand united with the Holy Father in his call to protect creation."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  He also asked them to "resist any effort to impair the development of a national carbon standard and instead to support our nation's ability to address this urgent global challenge confronting the human family."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;  Schneck opined that "This is different than the normal letters that the USCCB sends over all the time on a variety of issues. It really transcends the fault lines of both US politics and politics around the world."&lt;ref name=spoken/&gt;

Cornell anthropologists [[Annelise Riles]] and Vincent Ialenti told NPR.org: "We find ''Laudato Si''' important because it defies the United States' political imagination at every turn. In some moments, the pope reads like an archconservative, in other moments an archliberal. Sometimes he defers to scientists, other times he quotes scripture and, still other times, he criticizes the very foundations of economics. Mixing together ideas many see as incompatible, he forces us to think."&lt;ref&gt;*[https://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2015/09/26/442485534/excited-about-the-popes-visit-read-laudato-si "Excited About The Pope's Visit? Read 'Laudato Si'"] Cosmos &amp; Culture, NPR.org (26 September 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

''The New York Times'' reported that the encyclical put pressure on Catholics seeking the [[Republican Party presidential candidates, 2016|Republican Party nomination for president of the United States]] in 2016, including [[Jeb Bush]], [[Marco Rubio]], and [[Rick Santorum]], who "have questioned or denied the established science of human-caused climate change, and have harshly criticized policies designed to tax or regulate the burning of fossil fuels."&lt;ref name=davenport /&gt; Jeb Bush said: "I hope I'm not going to get castigated for saying this by my priest back home, but I don't get economic policy from my bishops or my cardinal or my pope."&lt;ref name=backlash /&gt;

====Neoconservative critique and counterarguments====
[[Neoconservative]] circles in the United States have criticized the encyclical right from its publication in Rome, sometimes in very harsh terms.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;  Writing in the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'', [[Irwin M. Stelzer]] has argued that

&lt;blockquote&gt; 
Pope Francis is unambiguously opposed to the American system of "savage capitalism". He has famously quoted a fourth century Doctor of the Church, [[St. Basil of Caesarea]], who called money "the devil's dung", has railed against the "anonymous influences of mammon" and a "new colonialism" that includes "free trade treaties... [and] imposition of austerity," and stated a preference for "cooperatives". Throw in Francis' views that we are witnessing "a disturbing warming of the climatic system... due to the great concentration of greenhouse gasses," and that "there is an urgent need of a true world political authority," and you have positions that it will take more than a spoonful of the Pontiff's charm to make go down the throats of many Americans.&lt;ref name=Stelzer/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== From industry ===
A [[lobbyist]] of [[Arch Coal]] sent an email to Republican lawmakers stating the pope "does not appear to address the tragedy of global [[energy poverty]]." The lobbyist argued the church should promote fossil fuels instead if he really cared about the poor.&lt;ref name=backlash /&gt; The email suggested "talking points" to the legislators for defending the coal industry and rejecting the arguments of the pope. The lobbyist wrote: "Billions of people around the globe are living without electrification and suffering through untold poverty and disease as a result." In contrast to these arguments the encyclical argues that fossil fuels in general and coal in particular threaten the poor: Fossil fuels are a threat to prosperity for the poor. They would suffer even more in particular from sea level rise, droughts, warming and extreme weather caused by burning fossil fuels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://newrepublic.com/article/122052/climate-deniers-say-nope-red-pope  Climate Deniers Say Nope to "Red Pope"], ''The New Republic'', 17 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== From other groups ===

The [[LGBT]]-interest magazine ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' noted that the encyclical contains passages which reinforce the church's position against the [[transsexuality]] movement, calling for "the acceptance of our bodies as God's gift."&lt;ref name="TheAdvocate"/&gt;

[[Bill McKibben]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' reviewed the encyclical.&lt;ref name="McKibben"/&gt;

== In music ==
On behalf of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limburg|Diocese of Limburg]], [[Peter Reulein]] wrote the music for the [[oratorio]] ''[[Laudato si' (oratorio)|Laudato si' – a Franciscan Magnificat]]'' to the [[libretto]] by [[Helmut Schlegel]] [[Order of Friars Minor|OFM]].&lt;ref name="Laudato si-score"&gt;{{cite book | last = Reulein | first = Peter | authorlink = Peter Reulein | last2 = Schlegel | first2 = Helmut | authorlink2 = Helmut Schlegel | title = Laudato si' / Ein franziskanisches Magnificat | publisher = [[Patrick Dehm|Dehm Verlag]] | location = [[Limburg an der Lahn]] | year = 2016 | isbn = 978-3-943302-34-9 | pages = 230 | ismn = 979-0-50226-047-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work is based on the Latin version of the [[Magnificat]], corresponds to the ''[[Extraordinary Jubilee of Mercy]],'' and includes texts from the [[apostolic exhortation]] ''[[Evangelii gaudium]]'' and the [[encyclical]] ''Laudato si'''.

'''Limerence''' is a state of mind which results from a [[Romance (love)|romantic attraction]] to another person and typically includes obsessive thoughts and fantasies and a desire to form or maintain a relationship with the object of love and have one's feelings reciprocated.

==Origin and meaning of the term==
[[Psychologist]] [[Dorothy Tennov]] coined the term "limerence" for her 1979 book, ''Love and Limerence:  The Experience of Being in Love'', to describe a concept that had grown out of her work in the mid-1960s, when she interviewed over 500 people on the topic of love.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tennov|first=Dorothy|authorlink=Dorothy Tennov|title=Love and Limerence: the Experience of Being in Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPsDAAAACAAJ|accessdate=12 March 2011|year=1999|publisher=Scarborough House|isbn=978-0-8128-6286-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence, which is not exclusively sexual, has been defined in terms of its potentially inspirational effects and in relation to [[attachment theory]]. It has been described as being "an involuntary potentially inspiring state of adoration and attachment to a limerent object (LO) involving [[Intrusive thought|intrusive]] and obsessive thoughts, feelings and behaviors from euphoria to despair, contingent on perceived emotional reciprocation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Willmott|first=Lynn|title=Love and Limerence: Harness the Limbicbrain| year= 2012| publisher= Lathbury House|isbn= 978-1481215312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attachment theory emphasizes that "many of the most intense [[emotion]]s arise during the formation, the maintenance, the disruption, and the renewal of attachment relationships".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first= John |last= Bowlby| title= Attachment| editor-first= Richard |editor-last= Gregory |work= The Oxford Companion to the Mind| publisher= Oxford |year= 1987| page= 57}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that "the state of limerence is the conscious experience of sexual incentive motivation" during attachment formation, "a kind of subjective experience of sexual incentive motivation"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|pp=173, 186}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the "intensive ... pair-forming stage"&lt;ref name="Morris1994"&gt;{{harvnb|Morris|1994|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; of human affectionate bonding.

==Characteristics==
The concept of 'limerence' "provides a particular carving up of the semantic domain of love",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=V. C. |editor-last=De Munck|title=Romantic Love and Sexual Behavior |year=1998 |page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and represents an attempt at a scientific study of the nature of love. Limerence is considered as a [[cognitive]] and emotional state of being emotionally attached to or even obsessed with another person, and is typically experienced involuntarily and characterized by a strong desire for reciprocation of one's feelings—a near-obsessive form of [[Romance (love)|romantic love]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Tennov, "sexual attraction is an essential component of limerence ... the limerent is a potential sex partner".&lt;ref name="Tennov"&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is sometimes also interpreted as [[infatuation]], or what is colloquially known as a "crush".  However, in common speech, infatuation includes aspects of immaturity and extrapolation from insufficient information, and is usually short-lived.  Tennov notes how limerence "may dissolve soon after its initiation, as in an early teenage buzz-centered crush",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she is more concerned with the point when "limerent bonds are characterized by 'entropy' crystallization as described by [[Stendhal]] in his 1821 treatise ''On Love'', where a new love infatuation perceptually begins to transform ... [and] attractive characteristics are exaggerated and unattractive characteristics are given little or no attention ... [creating] a 'limerent object'".

According to Tennov, there are at least two types of love: limerence, which she describes as, among other things, "loving attachment", and "loving affection", the bond that exists between an individual and their parents and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/dec/14/features.magazine47 |work= The Guardian |title= That crazy little thing called love |date= 14 December 2003 |accessdate= 15 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She notes that one form may evolve into the other: "Those whose limerence was replaced by affectional bonding with the same partner might say ... 'We were very much in love when we married; today we love each other very much'".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction is comparable to that drawn by [[ethologists]] "between the pair-forming and pair-maintaining functions of sexual activity",&lt;ref name="Morris1994" /&gt; just as "the attachment of the attachment theorists is very similar to the emotional reciprocation longed for in Tennov's limerence, and each is linked to sexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence is characterized by [[Intrusive thoughts|intrusive thinking]] and pronounced sensitivity to external events that reflect the disposition of the limerent object towards the individual. It can be experienced as intense [[joy]] or as extreme [[Despair (emotion)|despair]], depending on whether the feelings are reciprocated. Basically, it is the state of being completely carried away by unreasoned [[passion (emotion)|passion]] or [[love]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} even to the point of [[Addiction|addictive]]-type behavior. Usually, one is inspired with an intense passion or admiration for someone. Limerence can be difficult to understand for those who have never experienced it, and it is thus often dismissed by non-limerents as ridiculous fantasy or a construct of romantic fiction.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt;

Tennov differentiates between limerence and other emotions by asserting that [[love]] involves concern for the other person's welfare and feeling. While limerence does not require it, those concerns may certainly be incorporated. [[Affection]] and fondness exist only as a disposition towards another person, irrespective of whether those feelings are reciprocated, whereas limerence deeply desires reciprocation, but it remains unaltered whether or not it is returned. Physical contact with the object is neither essential nor sufficient to an individual experiencing limerence, unlike with one experiencing [[sexual attraction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=2|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where early, unhealthy attachment patterns or [[Psychological trauma|trauma]] influence limerence, the limerent object may be construed as an idealization of the figure or figures involved in the original unhealthy attachment or trauma. Lack of reciprocation may in such instances serve to reinforce lessons learned in earlier, unhealthy bonding experiences, and hence strengthen the limerence.

==Components==
Limerence involves intrusive thinking about the limerent object.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Other characteristics include acute longing for reciprocation, fear of rejection, and unsettling shyness in the limerent object's presence. In cases of unrequited limerence, transient relief may be found by vividly imagining reciprocation from the limerent object. Tennov suggests that feelings of limerence can be intensified through adversity, obstacles, or distance—'Intensification through Adversity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; A limerent person may have acute sensitivity to any act, thought, or condition that can be interpreted favorably. This may include a tendency to devise, fabricate, or invent "reasonable" explanations for why neutral actions are a sign of hidden passion in the limerent object.

A person experiencing limerence has a general intensity of feeling that leaves other concerns in the background. In their thoughts, such a person tends to emphasize what is admirable in the limerent object and to avoid any negative or problematic attributes.

===Intrusive thinking and fantasy===
During the height of limerence, thoughts of the limerent object (or person) are at once persistent, involuntary and intrusive. Such 'intrusive thoughts about the LO ... appear to be genetically driven':&lt;ref name="moore268"&gt;{{harvnb|Moore|1998|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, limerence is first and foremost a condition of cognitive obsession. This may be caused by low serotonin levels in the brain, comparable to those of people with [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Marazziti D, Akiskal HS, Rossi A, Cassano GB. "Alteration of the platelet serotonin transporter in romantic love." ''Psychol Med.'' 2000&lt;/ref&gt; All events, associations, stimuli, and experiences return thoughts to the limerent object with unnerving consistency, while conversely the constant thoughts about the limerent object define all other experiences. If a certain thought has no previous connection with the limerent object, immediately one is made. Limerent fantasy is unsatisfactory unless rooted in reality,&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; because the fantasizer may want the fantasy to seem realistic and somewhat possible.  At their most severe, intrusive limerent thoughts can occupy an individual's waking hours completely, resulting—like severe addiction—in significant or complete disruption of the limerent's normal interests and activities, including work and family.  For serial limerents, this can result in debilitating, lifelong underachievement in school, work, and family life.  Comparisons{{which|date=December 2013}} made between limerence and substance addiction may draw attention to the constant, free availability of the limerent's "drug of choice".

Fantasies that are concerned with far-fetched ideas are usually dropped by the fantasizer.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; Sometimes fantasizing is retrospective: actual events are replayed from memory with great vividness. This form predominates when what is viewed as evidence of possible reciprocation can be re-experienced (a kind of selective or revisionist history). Otherwise, the long fantasy is anticipatory; it begins in the everyday world and climaxes at the attainment of the limerent goal. A limerent fantasy can also involve an unusual, often tragic, event.

The long fantasies form bridges between the limerent's ordinary life and that intensely desired ecstatic moment. The duration and complexity of a fantasy depend on the availability of time and freedom from distractions. The bliss of the imagined moment of consummation is greater when events imagined to precede it are possible (though they often represent grave departures from the probable). Not always is it entirely pleasant, and when rejection seems likely the thoughts focus on despair, sometimes to the point of [[suicide]]. The pleasantness or unpleasantness of the state seems almost unrelated to the intensity of the reaction. Although the direction of feeling, i.e. happy versus unhappy, shifts rapidly, with 'dramatic surges of buoyancy and despair',&lt;ref name=moore268/&gt; the intensity of intrusive and involuntary thinking alters less rapidly, and only in response to an accumulation of experiences with the particular limerent object.

Fantasies are occasionally dreamed by the one experiencing limerence. Dreams give out strong emotion and happiness when experienced, but often end with despair when the subject awakens. Dreams can reawaken strong feelings toward the limerent object after the feelings have declined.

=== Fear of rejection ===
Along with an emphasis on the perceived exceptional qualities, and devotion to them, there is abundant doubt that the feelings are reciprocated: [[social rejection#Romantic rejection|rejection]]. Considerable self-doubt is encountered, leading to "personal incapacitation expressed through unsettling timidity in the presence of the person",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; something which causes misery and galvanizes desire.

In most cases, what destroys limerence is a suitably long period of time without [[Reciprocity (social psychology)|reciprocation]]. Although it appears that limerence advances with adversity, personal discomfort may foul it.  This discomfort results from a fear of the limerent object's opinions.

=== Hope ===
Limerence develops and is sustained when there is a certain balance of hope and uncertainty. The basis for limerent hope is not in objective reality but in reality as it is perceived. The inclination is to sift through nuances of speech and [[wikt:subtleties|subtleties]] of behavior for evidence of limerent hope. "Lovers, of course, are notoriously frantic [[epistemologist]]s, second only to paranoiacs (and analysts) as readers of signs and wonders."&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Adam. ''On Flirtation'' (London 1994) p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; "Little things" are noticed and endlessly analyzed for meaning. Such excessive concern over trivia may not be entirely unfounded, however, as body language can indicate reciprocated feeling. What the limerent object said and did is recalled with vividness. Alternative meanings for the behaviors recalled are sought. Each word and gesture is permanently available for review, especially those interpreted as evidence in favor of reciprocated feeling. When objects, people, places or situations are encountered with the limerent object, they are vividly remembered, especially if the limerent object  interacted with them in some way.

The belief that the limerent object does not and will not reciprocate can only be reached with great difficulty. Limerence can be carried quite far before acknowledgment of rejection is genuine, especially if it has not been addressed openly by the limerent object.

==Effects==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}

===Physical effects===
The physiological correlations of intense limerence can include [[seizure]]-like [[trembling]], [[pallor]], [[flushing (physiology)|flushing]], [[heart palpitations]], [[pupil dilation]] and general [[Muscle weakness|weakness]]. [[Awkwardness]], [[stuttering]], [[shyness]], and [[confusion]] predominate at the behavioral level. Less common effects include [[insomnia]], [[loss of appetite]],  and [[Syncope (medicine)|passing out]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

If there is extensive [[anxiety]], incorrect behaviour may torpedo the relationship, which may cause physical responses to manifest intensely. Some people acutely feel these effects either immediately or following contact with the limerent object.  Blended is dire ecstasy or keen despair, depending on the turn of events.

The sensitivity that stems from fear of rejection can darken limerent objects' perceived body language. Conflicted signs of [[desire]] may be emitted that confuse judgment.  Often the limerent object is currently involved with another or is in some other way unavailable.

A condition of sustained alertness, a heightening of awareness and an enormous fund of energy to deploy in pursuit of the limerent aim is developed. The sensation of limerence is felt in the midpoint of the chest, bottom of the throat, guts, or in some cases in the abdominal region.&lt;ref name="Love and Limerence" /&gt; This can be interpreted as ecstasy at times of mutuality, but its presence is most noticeable during [[Broken heart|despair at times of rejection]].

===Psychological effects===
Sufferers complain of abandonment, despair, and diabolically humiliating disappointment. A sense of paralyzing ambiguity predominates, punctuated by pining. The fact of intermittent or nonreciprocal response lends to labile vacillation. This [[limbo]] is the threshold for mental prostration.

== Sexuality ==
Awareness of [[physical attraction]] plays a key role in the development of limerence,&lt;ref name="Tennov" /&gt; but is not enough to satisfy the limerent desire, and is almost never the main focus; instead, the limerent focuses on what could be defined as the "beneficial attributes". Nevertheless, Tennov stresses that "the most consistent result of limerence is mating, not merely sexual interaction but also commitment".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tennov|1998|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limerence can be intensified after a sexual relationship has begun, and with more intense limerence there is greater desire for sexual contact. However, while sexual surrender at one time indicated the end of uncertainty felt by the limerent object – because in the past, a sexual encounter more often led to a feeling of obligation to commit – in modern times this is not necessarily the case.

The sexual aspect of limerence is not consistent from person to person.  Most limerents experience limerent sexuality as a component of romantic interest.  Some limerents, however, may experience limerence as a consequence of hyperarousal. In such cases, limerence may form as a [[defense mechanism]] against the limerent object, who is not perceived initially as a romantic ideal, but as a physical threat to the limerent.

[[Sexual fantasy|Sexual fantasies]] are distinct from limerent fantasies. Limerent fantasy is rooted in reality and is intrusive rather than voluntary. Sexual fantasies are under more or less voluntary control and may involve strangers, imaginary individuals, and situations that could not take place. Limerence elevates body temperature and increases relaxation{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}, a sensation of viewing the world with [[Optimism|rose-tinted glasses]], leading to a greater receptiveness to sexuality, and to daydreaming.

People can become aroused by the thought of sexual partners, acts, and situations that are not truly desired, whereas every detail of the limerent fantasy is passionately desired actually to take place. Limerence sometimes increases sexual interest in other partners when the limerent object is unreceptive or unavailable.

== Limerent reaction ==
The limerent reaction is a composite reaction – that is, it is composed of a series of separate reactions.  These reactions occur only where misperceptions meet adversity in the context of a romance.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Perhaps because of this unique specificity, limerent reactions can be uniquely quantified and predicted according to the schema described below.

Involvement increases if obstacles are externally imposed or if the limerent object’s feelings are doubted. Only if the limerent object were to be revealed as highly undesirable might limerence subside. The presence of some degree of doubt causes the intensity of the feelings to increase further.  The stage is reached at which the reaction is virtually impossible to dislodge. This adversity may be superficial or deep, internal or external, so that an individual may sometimes generate deep adversity where none exists.  Also "romance", as it were, need not be present in any genuine way for a limerent reaction to occur.

The course of limerence results in a more intrusive thinking pattern. This thinking pattern is an expectant and often joyous period with the initial focusing on the limerent object’s admirable qualities: [[crystallization (love)|crystallization]]. Then, under appropriate conditions of hope and uncertainty, the limerence intensifies further.

With evidence of reciprocation (real or imagined) from the limerent object, a state of extreme pleasure, even euphoria, is enjoyed. Thoughts are mainly occupied with considering and reconsidering what is attractive in the limerent object, replaying whatever events may have thus far transpired with the limerent object, and appreciating personal qualities perceived as possibly having sparked interest in the limerent object. At peak crystallization, almost all waking thoughts revolve around the limerent object. After this peak, the feelings eventually decline.

Fantasies are preferred to virtually any other activity with the exception of activities that are believed to help obtain the limerent object, and activities that involve actually being in the presence of the limerent object. The motivation to attain a "relationship" continues to intensify so long as a proper mix of hope and uncertainty exist.

== Limerent duration ==

Tennov estimates, based on both questionnaire and interview data, that the average limerent reaction duration, from the moment of initiation until a feeling of neutrality is reached, is approximately three years. The extremes may be as brief as a few weeks or as long as several decades. When limerence is brief, maximum intensity may not have been attained. According to David Sack, M.D., limerence lasts longer than romantic love, but is shorter than a healthy, committed partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Others suggest that 'the biogenetic sourcing of limerence determines its limitation, ordinarily, to a two-year span',&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Leggett|Malm|1995|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; that limerence generally lasts between 18 months and three years; but further studies on unrequited limerence have suggested longer durations. In turn, a limerent may only experience a single limerent episode, or may experience "serial" episodes, in which nearly one's entire mature life, from early puberty through late adulthood, can be consumed in successive limerent obsessions.

== Bond varieties ==
{{Main|Human bonding}}
Once the ''limerent reaction'' has initiated, one of three varieties of bonds may form, defined over a set duration of time, in relation to the experience or non-experience of limerence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Diamond|first1=Lisa|title=Emerging Perspectives on Distinctions Between Romantic Love and Sexual Desire|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=13|page=1|url=http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003453/http://www.psych.utah.edu/people/people/diamond/Publications/Emerging%20Perspectives.pdf|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The constitution of these bonds may vary over the course of the relationship, in ways that may either increase or decrease the intensity of the limerence.

The basis and interesting characteristic of this delineation made by Tennov, is that based on her research and interviews with people, all human bonded relationships can be divided into three varieties being defined by the amount of limerence or non-limerence each partner contributes to the relationship.

With an affectional bond, neither partner is limerent. With a Limerent-Nonlimerent bond, one partner is limerent. In a Limerent-Limerent bond, both partners are limerent.

Affectional bonding characterize those affectionate sexual relationships where neither partner is limerent; couples tend to be in love, but do not report continuous and unwanted intrusive thinking, feeling intense need for exclusivity, or define their goals in terms of reciprocity.  These types of bonded couples tend to emphasize compatibility of interests, mutual preferences in leisure activities, ability to work together, and in some cases a degree of relative contentment.

The bulk of relationships, however, according to Tennov, are those between a limerent person and a nonlimerent other, i.e. ''limerent-nonlimerent bonding''.  These bonds are characterized by unequal reciprocation.

Lastly, those relationship bonds in which there exists mutual reciprocation are defined as ''limerent-limerent bondings''.  Tennov argues that since limerence itself is an "unstable state", mutually limerent bonds would be expected to be short-lived; mixed relationships probably last longer than limerent-limerent relationships. Some limerent-limerent relationships evolve into affectional bondings over time as limerence declines.  Tennov describes such couples as "old marrieds" whose interactions are typically both stable and mutually gratifying.

==Mitigation==
In her study Tennov identified three ways in which limerence subsides: 
;Consummation (reciprocation)
:Each limerent has a slightly different view of acceptable reciprocation, and the reactions to reciprocation vary.  Some limerents remain limerent (as documented by Tennov), while for others the limerence subsides as the certainty of reciprocity grows.  Other limerents do not achieve any "real" consummation (e.g. physical, or in the form of an actual relationship) but find their limerence waning after a limerent object professes similar feelings.
;Starvation
:In this process, a lack of ''any'' notice (i.e. starvation, described by Tennov as "the onslaught of evidence that LO does not return the limerence") causes the limerent to gradually desensitize. This desensitization may take a long time, in which case a limerent's latent hypersensitivity may cause any attention given by a former LO, regardless of how slight, to be interpreted as a reason for hope, precipitating a resurgence of limerence.
;Transference
:The limerent transfers their romantic feelings to another person, thereby ending the initial limerence; the limerence is sometimes transferred as well.

==Continuing research==
Tennov's research has been continued{{when|refers to 2008 articles|date=January 2018}} by Albert Wakin, who knew Tennov at the [[University of Bridgeport]] but did not assist in her research, and Duyen Vo, a graduate student of [[Southern Connecticut State University]].&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news

The term "limerence" has been invoked in many popular media,{{according to whom|date=January 2018}} including self-help books, popular magazines, and websites.  However, according to a paper by Wakin and Vo, "In spite of the public’s exposure to limerence, the professional community, particularly clinical, is largely unaware of the concept."&lt;ref name="Wakin-Vo"&gt;{{Cite journal

They reported that more research must be gathered before the condition is suitable for inclusion in the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (''DSM'').&lt;ref name=usatoday/&gt;

Critics point out that Tennov's account "is based on interviews rather than on direct observation", but conclude that "despite its shortcomings, Tennov's work may constitute a basis for informed hypothesis formulation".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Agmo|2007|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media stylistics''' or '''mediated stylistics''' is a branch of [[Linguistics#Functional approaches|functional]] [[stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] that studies human communication in [[mass media]]. It can be considered a branch of [[media linguistics]]; that is, how media [[speech]] depends on the [[content (media)|content]], aims of communicators and the medium.

Media stylistics as a research approach is widely known in [[Eastern Europe]] and especially in [[Russia]], through the work of A. Vasileva, M. Kozhina, V. Kostomarov, L. Maydanova, I. Lysakova, K. Rogova, G. Solganik and others.

==Main problems==
Modern media stylistics in Russia develops mainly as stylistics of media text. The main particular problems of media stylistics are:
* the correlation between linguistic and extralinguistic organization of media texts;
* the role of the author's voice (G. Solganik, L. Kayda, L. Maydanova, N. Tsvetova, T. Shmeleva), their social (I. Lysakova) and genre (L. Duskaeva; I. Myasnikov; L. Maydanova, S. Kalganova, V. Konkov) typology;
* regularities of speech discovery of media texts as interaction of semantic positions (L. Duskaeva, T. Chernyshova), phatic (N. Kornilova, E. Chepkina, T. Chernyshova), polemic (L. Duskaeva, M. Kormilitsyna) and even hostile (E. Kakorina, V. Salimovsky, A. Skovorodnikov);
* sphere of concepts represented in media texts (E. Abramova, E. Malysheva, O. Orlova), their architectonics and composition (N. Bolotnova, L. Kayda, V. Konkov, N. Kuzmina);
* several expressive characteristics (T. Krasnova, M. Kormilitsyna) or their system (G. Bobrovskaya, G. Kopnina, A. Skovorodnikov; M. Kormilitsyna);
* idiostyle in a speech media environment (N. Bolotnova, M. Kormilitsyna O. Sirotinina), its textual (T. Matveeva) and functional semantics and stylistics (L. Duskaeva, T. Permyakova), intentional stylistics (L. Duskaeva, N. Tsvetova) and intentional (N. Klushina) categories - all those speech properties of texts which promote its effectiveness.

Along with stylistics of socio-political texts (V. Konkov, V. Salimovsky, G. Solganik, N. Klushina), the stylistics of journalistic leisure-texts develops (L. Duskaeva, N. Klushina, V. Konkov, E. Kara-Murza, T. Redkina, N. Tsvetova). The intentional-stylistic approach to the study of these texts develops extensively (V. Barbashov, L. Duskaeva, N. Kornilova, K.Prokhorova, N. Tsvetova) as well as stylistic approach to lingvo-etic problems (N. Bessarabova, T. Surikova, V. Suzdaltseva). As separate lines of media stylistics can be considered semiotic lingvostylistics of advertising texts (E. Kara-Murza), expert media stylistics (A. Baranov, E. Kara-Murza, M. Gorbanevsky, T. Chernyshova), stylistics of online media texts (E. Kakorina, T. Karpova).&lt;ref&gt;Duskaeva L. Media Stylistics: The New Concept or New Phenomenon // [[Russian Journal of Communication]]. 2011. № 4.

{{Books of the New Testament}}
{{Christianity|state=collapsed}}

The '''New Testament''' ({{lang-gr|Ἡ Καινὴ Διαθήκη}}, [[Transliteration|trans.]] ''Hē Kainḕ Diathḗkē''; {{lang-la|Novum Testamentum}}) is the second part of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], the first part being the [[Old Testament]], based on the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]], as well as events in [[Christianity in the 1st century|first-century Christianity]]. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as [[Religious text|sacred scripture]]. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the [[Early centers of Christianity|spread of Christianity around the world]]. It reflects and serves as a source for [[Christian theology]] and [[Christian ethics|morality]]. Extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgies]]. The New Testament has influenced religious, [[Philosophical movement|philosophical]], and [[Political movement|political]] [[Social movement|movements]] in [[Christendom]] and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.

The New Testament is a collection of Christian works written in the [[Koine Greek|common (Koine) Greek]] language of the first century, at different times by various writers, and the modern consensus is that it provides important evidence regarding [[Christianity and Judaism|Judaism]] in the first century AD.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Barton (theologian)|Barton, John]] (3 February 2012). "Before the parting of the ways". ''[[Times Literary Supplement]]''. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; In almost all Christian traditions today, the New Testament consists of 27 books. 
The [[Biblical canon|canon]] or list of the books of the New Testament is not found anywhere in any book of the Bible. It was the united Catholic Church which defined the 27-book canon. The first time we find the complete list of the 27 books of the NT is in Athanasius, eastern Catholic bishop of the IV Century. The first time that church councils gave us this same list was in the councils of Hippo (393) and Carthage (397) in north Africa and the pope Innocent I ratified the same canon in 405, but it is probable that a Council in Rome in 382 under pope Damasus gave the same list first. These councils also provided the canon of the Old Testament, which included the so-called apocryphal books &lt;ref&gt; Introduction to the New Testament. Werner Georg Kummel, pages 500f.

The original texts were written in the first century of the [[Christian Era]], in Greek, which was the [[Lingua franca|common language]] of the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] from the [[Wars of Alexander the Great|conquests of Alexander the Great]] (335–323 BC) until the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 7th century AD.

Collections of related texts such as [[Pauline epistles|letters]] of the [[Paul the Apostle|Apostle Paul]] (a major collection of which must have been made already by the early 2nd century)&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Clabeaux, J.

Over time, some [[Antilegomena|disputed books]], such as the [[Book of Revelation]] and the [[Catholic epistles|Minor Catholic (General) Epistles]] were introduced into [[Biblical canon|canons]] in which they were originally absent. Other works earlier held to be Scripture, such as [[1 Clement]], the [[Shepherd of Hermas]], and the [[Diatessaron]], were excluded from the New Testament. The Old Testament canon is not completely uniform among all major Christian groups including [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], [[Protestantism|Protestants]], the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], the [[Slavic Orthodox|Slavic Orthodox Churches]], and the [[Armenian Orthodox Church]]. However, the [[Development of the New Testament canon|twenty-seven-book canon]] of the New Testament, at least since [[Late Antiquity]], has been almost universally recognized within [[Christianity]] (see [[Development of the New Testament canon]]).

The New Testament consists of:
*Four narratives of the life, teaching, death and resurrection of Jesus called "gospel" or the good news.
*A narrative of the [[Apostles|Apostle]] ministries in the [[Early Christianity|early church]], called the "Acts of the Apostles", and probably written by the same writer as the [[Gospel of Luke]], which it continues;
*Twenty-one letters, often called "[[epistles]]" from Greek "epistole", written by various authors, and consisting of Christian doctrine, counsel, instruction, and conflict resolution; and
*An [[Apocalypse]], the [[Book of Revelation]], which is a [[Prophecy|book of prophecy]], containing some instructions to [[Seven churches of Asia|seven local congregations of Asia Minor]], but mostly containing prophetical [[semiotics|symbology]], about the [[end time]]s.

Modern English, like Latin, distinguishes [[wikt:testament|testament]] and [[wikt:covenant|covenant]] as alternative translations, and consequently the treatment of the term διαθήκη ''diathḗkē'' varies in [[Bible translations into English]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[John Wycliffe]]'s 1395 version is a translation of the [[Latin Vulgate]] and so follows different terms in Jeremiah and Hebrews:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:Lo! days shall come, saith the Lord, and I shall make a new covenant (from Latin ''foedus'') with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah.{{Bibleref2c|Jeremiah|31:31}}

:For he reproving him saith, Lo! days come, saith the Lord, when I shall establish a new testament (from Latin ''testamentum'') on the house of Israel, and on the house of Judah.{{Bibleref2c|Hebrews|8:8}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Use of the term ''New Testament'' to describe a collection of first and second-century Christian Greek Scriptures can be traced back to [[Tertullian]] (in ''Against [[Praxeas]]'' 15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Allen, Clifton J. | date = 1969 | title = The Broadman Bible Commentary: Volume 8, General Articles, Matthew-Mark | location = London, England, and Nashville, Tennessee, USA | publisher = Broadman Press | asin = B000BUN8GM | quote = Tertullian was apparently the first to use the term New Testament in the sense of a collection of books (Against Praxeas XV). }}{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Against [[Marcion]]'', written ''circa'' 208 AD, he writes of
&lt;blockquote&gt;
the Divine Word, who is doubly edged with the two testaments of the [[Torah|law]] and the [[gospel]].&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. "Chapter XIV". [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian123.html ''Against Marcion, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
And Tertullian continues later in the book, writing:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
it is certain that the whole aim at which he [Marcion] has strenuously laboured, even in the drawing up of his [[Antitheses]], centres in this, that he may establish a diversity between the Old and the New Testaments, so that his own [[Christ]] may be separate from the [[Creator God|Creator]], as belonging to this rival god, and as alien from the law and the [[Neviim|prophets]].&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian. "Chapter VI". [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian124.html ''Against Marcion, Book IV''].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;See also Tertullian, [http://earlychristianwritings.com/text/tertullian124.html ''Against Marcion, Book IV''], chapters I, II, XIV. However, his meaning in chapter XX is less clear, and in chapters IX and XL he uses the term to mean "new covenant".&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By the [[Christianity in the 4th century|4th century]], the existence—even if not the exact contents—of both an Old and New Testament had been established. [[Lactantius]], a 3rd–4th century Christian author wrote in his early-4th-century Latin ''Institutiones Divinae'' (''Divine Institutes''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
But all scripture is divided into two Testaments. That which preceded the advent and passion of Christ—that is, the [[Torah|law]] and the [[Neviim|prophets]]—is called the Old; but those things which were written after His resurrection are named the New Testament. The Jews make use of the Old, we of the New: but yet they are not discordant, for the New is the fulfilling of the Old, and in both there is the same testator, even Christ, who, having suffered death for us, made us heirs of His everlasting kingdom, the people of the Jews being deprived and disinherited. As the prophet Jeremiah testifies when he speaks such things: "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will make a new testament to the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not according to the testament which I made to their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they continued not in my testament, and I disregarded them, saith the Lord."{{Bibleref2c|Jer|31:31–32}}  ... For that which He said above, that He would make a new testament to the house of Judah, shows that the old testament which was given by Moses was not perfect; but that which was to be given by Christ would be complete.&lt;ref&gt;Lactantius. "Chapter XX". [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.iii.ii.iv.xx.html "The Divine Institutes, Book IV"].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Books==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2016}}
{{See also|Christian biblical canons|Development of the New Testament canon|New Testament apocrypha|Template:Books of the New Testament}}
The [[canon of the New Testament]] is the collection of books that most [[Christians]] regard as [[Biblical inspiration|divinely inspired]] and constituting the New Testament of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]].&lt;ref name="mcdowell2006_canon"&gt;McDowell, Josh. Evidence for Christianity. Tennessee: Thomas Nelson, Inc. 2006. pp. 42–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period extending roughly from 50 to 150 AD, a number of documents began to circulate among the churches, including epistles, gospel accounts, memoirs, prophecies, homilies, and collections of teachings.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} While some of these documents were [[Apostolic Age|apostolic in origin]], others drew upon the tradition the apostles and ministers of the word had utilized in their individual missions, and still others represented a summation of the teaching entrusted to a particular church center.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Several of these writings sought to extend, interpret, and apply apostolic teaching to meet the needs of Christians in a given locality.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In general, among [[Christian denominations]] the New Testament canon came to be agreed-upon as a list of 27 books, although the order of the books can vary from one version of the printed scriptures to the next.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The book order is the same in the Greek Orthodox,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Roman Catholic,{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} and Protestant traditions.&lt;ref name="Luther"&gt;Bouman, Herbert J.

===The Gospels===
{{Main article|Canonical gospels}}
Each of the four [[gospels]] in the New Testament narrates the life, death, and resurrection of [[Jesus]] of [[Nazareth]]. The word "gospel" derives from the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''gōd-spell''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Gospel |title=Gospel |publisher=Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (rarely ''godspel''), meaning "good news" or "glad tidings". The gospel was considered the "good news" of the coming [[Messiah#Christianity|Kingdom of Messiah]], and the redemption through the life and death of Jesus, the central Christian message.&lt;ref name="ODCC self Gospel"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed (2005). "Gospel". The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Gospel is a [[calque]] (word-for-word translation) of the [[Koine Greek|Greek]] word {{lang|grc|εὐαγγέλιον}}, ''euangelion'' (''eu-'' "good", ''-angelion'' "message").

Since the 2nd century, the four narrative accounts of the life and work of Jesus Christ have been referred to as "The Gospel of ..." or "The Gospel according to ..." followed by the name of the supposed author. Whatever these admittedly early ascriptions may imply about the sources behind or the perception of these gospels, they are anonymous compositions.&lt;ref name = seeStandard/&gt;
* The [[Gospel of Matthew]], ascribed to the [[Matthew the Evangelist|Apostle Matthew]]. This gospel begins with a [[genealogy of Jesus]] and a story of his birth that includes a visit from [[Biblical Magi|magi]] and a [[flight into Egypt]], and it ends with the [[Great Commission|commissioning of the disciples]] by the resurrected Jesus.
* The [[Gospel of Mark]], ascribed to [[Mark the Evangelist]]. This gospel begins with the preaching of [[John the Baptist]] and the [[baptism of Jesus]]. Two different secondary endings were affixed to this gospel in the 2nd century.
* The [[Gospel of Luke]], ascribed to [[Luke the Evangelist]], who was not one of [[Twelve Disciples#The Twelve Apostles|the Twelve Apostles]], but was mentioned as a companion of the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]] and as a physician.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, Joseph A. (1985). ''The Gospel according to Luke, Vol. 1''. Anchor Bible Commentary series. New York: Doubleday. pp. 35–53.&lt;/ref&gt; This gospel begins with parallel stories of the birth and childhood of [[John the Baptist]] and [[Jesus]] and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus and his ascension into heaven.
* The [[Gospel of John]], ascribed to [[John the Apostle]]. This gospel begins with a philosophical prologue and ends with appearances of the resurrected Jesus. It is about Jesus's miracles.

The first three gospels listed above are classified as the [[Synoptic Gospels]]. They contain similar accounts of the events in Jesus' life and his teaching, due to their literary interdependence. The Gospel of John is structured differently and includes stories of several miracles of Jesus and sayings not found in the other three.

These four gospels that were eventually included in the New Testament were only a few among many other early Christian gospels. The existence of such texts is even mentioned at the beginning of the Gospel of Luke.{{Bibleref2c|Luke|1:1–4}} Other early Christian gospels such as the so-called "[[Jewish-Christian Gospels]]" or the [[Gospel of Thomas]], also offer both a window into the context of [[early Christianity]] and may provide some assistance in the reconstruction of the [[historical Jesus]].

===Acts of the Apostles===
The [[Acts of the Apostles]] is a narrative of the apostles' ministry and activity after [[Christ's death]] and resurrection, from which point it resumes and functions as a sequel to the [[Gospel of Luke]]. Examining style, phraseology, and other evidence, modern scholarship generally concludes that Acts and the Gospel of Luke share the same author, referred to as [[Luke–Acts]]. Luke-Acts does not name its author.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=196}} Church tradition identified him as [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, but the majority of scholars reject this due to the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|p=235}} The most probable date of composition is around 80–100 AD, and there is evidence that it was still being substantially revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250–53}}

===Epistles===
The epistles of the New Testament are considered by Christians to be divinely inspired and holy letters, written by the apostles and disciples of Christ, to either local congregations with specific needs, or to New Covenant Christians in general, scattered about; or "Catholic Epistles."

====Pauline Letters to Churches====
{{Main article|Pauline epistles}}
The Pauline epistles are the thirteen New Testament books that present [[Paul the Apostle]] as their author.{{refn|group=note|[[Joseph Barber Lightfoot]] in his ''Commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians'' writes: "At this point [{{Bibleref2|Gal|6:11}}] the apostle takes the pen from his [[amanuensis]], and the concluding paragraph is written with his own hand. From the time when letters began to be forged in his name ({{bibleref2|2 Thess|2:2||2 Thess. 3:17}}; {{bibleref2-nb|2 Thess|3:17||2 Thess. 3:17}}) it seems to have been his practice to close with a few words in his own handwriting, as a precaution against such forgeries.... In the present case he writes a whole paragraph, summing up the main lessons of the epistle in terse, eager, disjointed sentences. He writes it, too, in large, bold characters (Gr. ''pelikois grammasin''), that his handwriting may reflect the energy and determination of his soul."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lightfoot |first=Joseph Barber |year=1866 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N8ECAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA217 |title=St Paul's Epistle to the Galatians |edition=2nd |publisher=MacMillan &amp; Co |page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Six of the letters are disputed. Four are thought by most modern scholars to be [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigraphic]], i.e., not actually written by Paul even if attributed to him within the letters themselves.  Opinion is more divided on the other two disputed letters (2 Thessalonians and Colossians).&lt;ref&gt;Bassler, Jouette M. (2010). "Paul and his Letters". In Aune, David E. ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. Wiley-Blackwell. p. 388. {{ISBN|9781444318944}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These letters were written to Christian communities in specific cities or geographical regions, often to address issues faced by that particular community. Prominent themes include the relationship both to broader "[[Gentile|pagan]]" society, to Judaism, and to other Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Roetzel, Calvin J. (2009). ''The Letters of Paul: Conversations in Context'' (5th ed.). Louisville, Kentucky: Westminster John Knox. {{ISBN|9780664233921}}.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Epistle to the Romans]]
*[[First Epistle to the Corinthians]]
*[[Second Epistle to the Corinthians]]
*[[Epistle to the Galatians]]
*[[Epistle to the Ephesians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
*[[Epistle to the Philippians]]
*[[Epistle to the Colossians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
*[[First Epistle to the Thessalonians]]
*[[Second Epistle to the Thessalonians]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]

====Pauline Letters to Persons====
The last four Pauline letters in the New Testament are addressed to individual persons. They include the following:
* [[First Epistle to Timothy]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Second Epistle to Timothy]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Epistle to Titus]]&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;
* [[Epistle to Philemon]]
[Disputed letters are marked with an asterisk (*).]

All of the above except for Philemon are known as the [[Pastoral epistles]]. They are addressed to individuals charged with pastoral oversight of churches and discuss issues of Christian living, doctrine and leadership. They often address different concerns to those of the preceding epistles. These letters are believed by many to be pseudepigraphic. Some scholars (e.g., Bill Mounce, Ben Witherington) will argue that the letters are genuinely Pauline, or at least written under Paul's supervision.

====Hebrews====
The [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] addresses a Jewish audience who had come to believe that Jesus was the [[Messiah#Judaism|anointed one]] (Hebrew: מָשִׁיחַ—transliterated in English as "Moshiach", or "Messiah"; Greek: Χριστός—transliterated in English as "Christos", for "[[Christ]]") who was predicted in the writings of the Hebrew Bible. The author discusses the "better-ness" of the new covenant and the ministry of Jesus, over the Mosaic covenant {{Bibleref2c|Heb.|1:1–10:18}} and urges the readers in the practical implications of this conviction through the end of the epistle.{{Bibleref2c|Heb.|10:19–13:25}}

The book has been widely accepted by the Christian church as inspired by God and thus authoritative, despite the acknowledgment of uncertainties about who its human author was. Regarding authorship, although the Epistle to the Hebrews does not internally claim to have been written by the [[Paul of Tarsus|Apostle Paul]], some similarities in wordings to some of the Pauline Epistles have been noted and inferred. In antiquity, some began to ascribe it to Paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold W. Attridge|Attridge, Harold W.]] (1989). ''Hebrews''. Hermeneia. Philadelphia: Fortress. pp. 1–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 4th century, [[Jerome]] and [[Augustine of Hippo]] supported [[Authorship of the Pauline epistles|Paul's authorship]]. The Church largely agreed to include Hebrews as the fourteenth letter of Paul, and affirmed this authorship until the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]]. The letter to the Hebrews had difficulty in being accepted as part of the Christian canon because of its anonymity.&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Lane|Lane, William L.]] (1991). ''Hebrews 1–8''. Word Biblical Commentary series, Vol. 47A. Dallas, Texas: Word Books. p. cliv.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as the 3rd century, [[Origen]] wrote of the letter, "Men of old have handed it down as Paul's, but who wrote the Epistle God only knows."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250106.htm |author=Eusebius |title=Church History, Book VI |chapter=Chapter 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary scholars often reject Pauline authorship for the epistle to the Hebrews,&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2004:411"&gt;Ehrman, Bart D. (1997). ''The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings''. Oxford University Press. p. 323. "Scholars in the ancient world went about detecting forgeries in much the same way that modern scholars do. They looked to see whether the ideas and writing style of a piece conformed with those used by the author in other writings, and they examined the text for any blatant anachronisms, that is, statements about things that could not have existed at the time the alleged author was writing (like the letter reputedly from an early seventeenth-century American colonist that mentions "the United States")- Arguments of this kind were used by some Christian scholars of the third century to show that Hebrews was not written by Paul or the Book of Revelation by John the son of Zebedee. Modern scholars, as we will see, concur with these judgments. To be sure, neither of these books can be considered a forgery. Hebrews does not claim to be written by Paul (it is anonymous), and the John who wrote Revelation does not claim to be the son of Zebedee (it is therefore homonymous). Are there other books in the New Testament, though, that can be considered forgeries?"&lt;/ref&gt; based on its distinctive style and theology, which are considered to set it apart from Paul's writings.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell |first=Mark A. |year=2009 |title=Introducing the New Testament: A Historical, Literary, and Theological Survey |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan|publisher=Baker Academic |pages=431–32 |isbn=9780801028687 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Catholic epistles====
The [[Catholic epistles]] (or "general epistles") consist of both letters and treatises in the form of letters written to the church at large. The term "[[catholic]]" ([[Koine Greek|Greek]]: καθολική, ''katholikē''), used to describe these letters in the oldest manuscripts containing them, here simply means "general" or "universal". The authorship of a number of these is disputed.
* [[Epistle of James]], written by an author named "James", often identified with [[James the Just|James, the brother of Jesus]].
* [[First Epistle of Peter]], ascribed to the [[Saint Peter|Apostle Peter]].
* [[Second Epistle of Peter]], ascribed to the Apostle Peter, though widely considered not to have been written by him.&lt;ref&gt;Fornberg, Tord (1977). ''An Early Church in a Pluralistic Society: A Study of 2 Peter''. Coniectanea Biblica, New Testament Series 9. Lund: Gleerup.{{page needed|date=February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[First Epistle of John]], ascribed to [[John the Apostle]].
* [[Second Epistle of John]], ascribed to John the Apostle.
* [[Third Epistle of John]], ascribed to John the Apostle.
* [[Epistle of Jude]], written under the name of [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Jude, the brother of Jesus and James]].

===Book of Revelation===
{{Further information|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The final book of the New Testament is the [[Book of Revelation]], also known as the Apocalypse of John. In the New Testament canon, it is considered [[Bible prophecy|prophetical]] or [[apocalyptic literature]]. Its authorship has been attributed either to John the Apostle (in which case it is often thought that John the Apostle is [[John the Evangelist]], i.e. author of the [[Gospel of John]]) or to another John designated "[[John of Patmos]]" after the island where the text says the revelation was received (1:9). Some ascribe the writership date as circa 81–96 AD, and others at around 68 AD.&lt;ref name=Mounce&gt;[[Robert Mounce|Mounce, Robert]] (1998). [https://books.google.com/books?id=06VR1JzzLNsC&amp;pg=PA15 ''The Book of Revelation''] (revised ed.). The New International Commentary on the New Testament Series. Cambridge, UK: Eerdmans. pp. 15–16. {{ISBN|0802825370}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The work opens with letters to [[Seven churches of Asia|seven churches]] and thereafter takes the form of an [[apocalypse]], a literary genre popular in ancient Judaism and Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed study of the Apocalypse of John, see Aune, David E.

;Table notes

&lt;references group=N /&gt;

==Book order==
The order in which the books of the New Testament appear differs between some collections and ecclesiastical traditions. In the Latin West, prior to the [[Vulgate]] (an early 5th-century Latin version of the Bible), the four Gospels were arranged in the following order: Matthew, John, Luke, and Mark.{{refn|group=note|The Gospels are in this order in many Old Latin manuscripts, as well as in the Greek manuscripts [[Codex Bezae]] and [[Codex Washingtonianus]].}} The Syriac [[Peshitta]] places the major Catholic epistles (James, 1 Peter, and 1 John) immediately after Acts and before the Pauline epistles.

The order of an early edition of the letters of Paul is based on the size of the letters: longest to shortest, though keeping 1 and 2 Corinthians and 1 and 2 Thessalonians together. The Pastoral epistles were apparently not part of the ''Corpus Paulinum'' in which this order originated and were later inserted after 2 Thessalonians and before Philemon. Hebrews was variously incorporated into the ''Corpus Paulinum'' either after 2 Thessalonians, after Philemon (i.e. at the very end), or after Romans.

The New Testament of the 16th-century [[Luther Bible]] continues, to this day, to place Hebrews, James, Jude, and the Apocalypse last. This reflects the thoughts of the Reformer Martin Luther [[Luther's canon|on the canonicity of these books]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/links10.html|title=Web Directory: German Bible Versions|publisher=Bible Research|accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|See also the article on the [[Antilegomena]].}}{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Apocrypha==
{{Main article|New Testament apocrypha}}
The books that eventually found a permanent place in the New Testament were not the only works of Christian literature produced in the earliest Christian centuries. The long process of [[Development of the New Testament canon|canonization]] began early, sometimes with tacit reception of traditional texts, sometimes with explicit selection or rejection of particular texts as either acceptable or unacceptable for use in a given context (e.g., not all texts that were acceptable for private use were considered appropriate for use in the [[liturgy]]).

Over the course of history, those works of early Christian literature that survived but that did not become part of the New Testament have been variously grouped by theologians and scholars. Drawing upon, though redefining, an older term used in [[early Christianity]] and among Protestants when referring to those books found in the Christian [[Old Testament]] although not in the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]], modern scholars began to refer to these works of early Christian literature not included in the New Testament as "apocryphal", by which was meant non-canonical.

Collected editions of these works were then referred to as the "[[New Testament apocrypha]]". Typically excluded from such published collections are the following groups of works: [[Apostolic Fathers|The Apostolic Fathers]], the 2nd-century Christian apologists, [[Alexandrian school|the Alexandrians]], [[Tertullian]], [[Methodius of Olympus]], [[Novatian]], [[Cyprian]], martyrdoms, and [[Desert Fathers|the Desert Fathers]]. Almost all other Christian literature from the period, and sometimes including works composed well into [[Late Antiquity]], are relegated to the so-called New Testament apocrypha.

Although not considered to be inspired by God,  these "apocryphal" works may be helpful in the study of the New Testament in that they were produced in the same ancient context and often using the same language as those books that would eventually form the New Testament. Some of these later works are dependent (either directly or indirectly) upon books that would later come to be in the New Testament or upon the ideas expressed in them. There is even an example of a [[pseudepigraph]]ical letter composed under the guise of a presumably lost letter of the Apostle Paul, the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]].

==Authors==
{{Main article|Authorship of the Bible}}
The books of the New Testament were all or nearly all written by [[Jewish Christians]]—that is, Jewish disciples of Christ, who lived in the [[Roman Empire]], and under [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Powell|2009|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luke, who wrote the Gospel of Luke and the Book of Acts, is frequently thought of as an exception; scholars are divided as to whether Luke was a Gentile or a [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jew]].&lt;ref name="Strelan2013"&gt;Strelan, Rick (2013). ''Luke the Priest: The Authority of the Author of the Third Gospel''. Farnham, ENG: Routledege-[[Ashgate Publishing|Ashgate]]. pp. 102–105.&lt;/ref&gt; A few scholars identify the author of the Gospel of Mark as probably a Gentile, and similarly for the Gospel of Matthew, though most assert Jewish-Christian authorship.&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Mark, see Schröter, Jens (2010). "Gospel of Mark". In Aune, David. ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. New York, USA: Wiley-Blackwell. pp. 281f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Mark, see Hare, Douglas R. A. (1996). ''Mark''. Louisville, Kentucky, USA: Westminster John Knox Press. pp. 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For discussion of Matthew, see Repschinski, Boris (1998).

===Gospels===
{{Main article|Synoptic Gospels}}
Authorship is an area of longstanding and current research and debate, with different works posing different problems for identification. While the various works have traditional ascriptions of authorship, these ascriptions are in some cases defended by scholars, and in other cases disputed or rejected.&lt;ref&gt;For overviews of the scholarship on authorship of the various New Testament works, see the relevant entries in Aune, David E., ed. (2010). ''The Blackwell Companion to the New Testament''. Hoboken, New Jersey, USA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; According to many (if not most) critical scholars, none of the authors of the Gospels were eyewitnesses or even explicitly claimed to be eyewitnesses.&lt;ref name=lost&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|authorlink=Bart D.

There is a tradition that the Apostle John was the author of the Gospel of John. Traditionalists (such as biblical commentators Albert Barnes and Matthew Henry) seem to support the idea that the writer of the Gospel of John himself claimed to be an eyewitness in their commentaries of John 21:24 and therefore the gospel was written by an eyewitness;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barnes |first=Albert |title=Barnes' Notes on the New Testament |year=1962 |orig-year=1832 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qvXCoSQ1y0EC&amp;pg=PA360 |publisher=Kregel Publications |page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Henry&gt;{{Cite book|last=Henry |first=Matthew |title=Matthew Henry Complete Commentary on the Whole Bible |orig-year=1706 |url=http://www.studylight.org/commentaries/mhm/john-21.html |publisher=StudyLight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, this idea is rejected by the majority of modern scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Johannine Literature|last1=Lindars|first1=Barnabas|authorlink1 = Barnabas Lindars |last2=Edwards|first2=Ruth B.|last3=Court|first3=John M.|year=2000|publisher=Sheffield Academic Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qVOD0PhayhsC&amp;pg=PA41|ref=harv|pages=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of [[Richard Bauckham]]'s book ''Jesus and the Eyewitnesses: The Gospels as Eyewitness Testimony'' states "The common wisdom in the academy is that stories and sayings of Jesus circulated for decades, undergoing countless retellings and embellishments before being finally set down in writing."&lt;ref name="HahnScott2007"&gt;{{cite book|editor-first1=Scott W.|editor-last1=Hahn|editor-first2=David|editor-last2=Scott|title=Letter &amp; Spirit, Volume 3: The Hermeneutic of Continuity: Christ, Kingdom, and Creation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vJ-fd4hQQJ0C&amp;pg=PA225|date=1 September 2007|publisher=Emmaus Road Publishing|isbn=978-1-931018-46-3|page=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most scholars hold to the [[two-source hypothesis]], which claims that the [[Marcan priority|Gospel of Mark was written first]]. According to the hypothesis, the authors of the Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of Luke then used the Gospel of Mark and the hypothetical [[Q document]], in addition to some other sources, to write their individual gospel accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/mark.html |title=Gospel of Mark |publisher=Early Christian Writings |accessdate=15 January 2008 |last=Kirby |first=Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Achtemeier |first=Paul J. |encyclopedia=The Anchor Bible Dictionary |title=The Gospel of Mark |year=1992 |publisher=Doubleday |volume=4 |location=New York |isbn=0-385-19362-9 |page=545}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Easton, M.

Scholars agree that the Gospel of John was written last, by using a different tradition and body of testimony. In addition, most scholars agree that the author of Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles. Scholars hold that these books constituted two halves of a single work, [[Luke-Acts]].

===Pauline epistles===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Pauline epistles}}
[[File:PaulT.jpg|thumb|''Saint Paul Writing His Epistles'', 17th-century painting. Most scholars think Paul actually dictated his letters to a secretary.]]
The Pauline epistles are the thirteen books in the New Testament traditionally attributed to [[Paul of Tarsus]]. The anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews is, despite unlikely Pauline authorship, often functionally grouped with these thirteen to form a corpus of fourteen "Pauline" epistles.{{refn|group=note|Although Hebrews was almost certainly not written by Paul, it has been a part of the Pauline corpus "from the beginning of extant MS production".&lt;ref name=hebot01&gt;{{cite web |last=Wallace |first=Daniel B. |url=https://bible.org/seriespage/19-hebrews-introduction-argument-and-outline |title=Hebrews: Introduction, Argument, and Outline |publisher=Bible.org |date=28 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Seven letters are generally classified as "undisputed", expressing contemporary scholarly near consensus that they are the work of Paul: Romans, 1 Corinthians, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, 1 Thessalonians and Philemon. Six additional letters bearing Paul's name do not currently enjoy the same academic consensus: Ephesians, Colossians, 2 Thessalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy and Titus.{{refn|group=note|name="Lock, Meinertz p.622"|Guthrie lists: ohlenberg, Lock, Meinertz, Thornell, Schlatter, Spicq, [[Jeremais|Jeremias]], Simpson, Kelly, and Fee"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Guthrie|1990|p=622}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While many scholars uphold the traditional view, some question whether the first three, called the "Deutero-Pauline Epistles", are authentic letters of Paul. As for the latter three, the "Pastoral epistles", some scholars uphold the traditional view of these as the genuine writings of the Apostle Paul;&lt;ref group="note" name="Lock, Meinertz p.622"/&gt; most, however, regard them as [[Pseudepigraphy|pseudepigrapha]].&lt;ref&gt;Ehrman (2004), p. 385.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One might refer to the [[Epistle to the Laodiceans]] and the [[Third Epistle to the Corinthians]] as examples of works identified as pseudonymous. Since the early centuries of the church, there has been debate concerning the authorship of the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews, and contemporary scholars generally reject Pauline authorship.&lt;ref name="Ehrman 2004:411"/&gt;

The epistles all share common themes, emphasis, vocabulary and style; they exhibit a uniformity of doctrine concerning the [[Ten Commandments|Mosaic Law]], Jesus, faith, and various other issues. All of these letters easily fit into the chronology of Paul's journeys depicted in Acts of the Apostles.

===Other epistles===
The author of the [[Epistle of James]] identifies himself in the opening verse as "James, a servant of [[God]] and of the Lord [[Jesus]] Christ". From the middle of the 3rd century, [[patristic]] authors cited the ''Epistle'' as written by [[James the Just]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicity.com/encyclopedia/j/james,epistle_of_st.html "Epistle of St. James"]. ''1914 Catholic Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient and modern scholars have always been divided on the issue of authorship. Many consider the epistle to be written in the late 1st or early 2nd centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earlychristianwritings.com/james.html |title=Epistle of James |publisher=Early Christian Writings |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of the [[First Epistle of Peter]] identifies himself in the opening verse as "Peter, an [[Apostle (Christian)|apostle]] of Jesus Christ", and the view that the epistle was written by St. Peter is attested to by a number of [[Church Fathers]]: [[Irenaeus]] (140–203), [[Tertullian]] (150–222), [[Clement of Alexandria]] (155–215) and [[Origen of Alexandria]] (185–253). Unlike [[The Second Epistle of Peter]], the authorship of which was debated in antiquity, there was little debate about Peter's authorship of this first epistle until the 18th century. Although 2 Peter internally purports to be a work of the apostle, many biblical scholars have concluded that Peter is not the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What Are They Saying About the Catholic Epistles? |first=Philip B. |last=Harner |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xenz0ZMWDNsC&amp;pg=PA49 |publisher=Paulist Press |year=2004|isbn=9780809141883 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For an early date and (usually) for a defense of the Apostle Peter's authorship see Kruger,&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, M.J.

The Epistle of Jude title is written as follows: "Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James" ([[New Revised Standard Version|NRSV]]). The debate has continued over the author's identity as the apostle, the brother of Jesus, both, or neither.&lt;ref&gt;Bauckham, R. J. (1986). ''Word Biblical Commentary, Vol. 50''. Word (UK) Ltd. p. 14f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johannine works===
{{Main article|Authorship of the Johannine works}}
The [[First Epistle of John]] is traditionally held to have been composed by [[John the Apostle]] (the author of the [[Gospel of John]]) when the writer was in advanced age. The epistle's content, language and conceptual style indicate that it may have had the same author as the Gospel of John, 2 John and 3 John.&lt;ref name="Harris 1John"&gt;{{harvp|Harris|1985|loc="1 John"|pp=355–356}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eusebius]] claimed that the author of 2nd and 3rd John was not [[John the Apostle]], but an "elder John" which refers either to the apostle at an advanced age or a hypothetical second individual ("[[John the Elder]]").&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. "Chapter 39". [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''The Church History, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars today are divided on the issue.

===Revelation===
The author of the [[Book of Revelation]] identifies himself several times as "John".{{Bibleref2c|Rev.|1:1,4,9;22:8||Rev.&amp;nbsp;1:1,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;9;&amp;nbsp;22:8}} and states that he was on [[Patmos]] when he received his first vision.{{Bibleref2c|Rev.|1:9;4:1-2||Rev.&amp;nbsp;1:9;&amp;nbsp;4:1-2}} As a result, the author is sometimes referred to as [[John of Patmos]]. The author has traditionally been identified with [[John the Apostle]] to whom the [[Gospel of John|Gospel]] and the [[epistles of John]] were attributed. It was believed that he was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of the [[Roman emperor]] [[Domitian]], and there wrote Revelation. [[Justin Martyr]] (c. 100–165 AD) who was acquainted with [[Polycarp]], who had been mentored by John, makes a possible allusion to this book, and credits John as the source.&lt;ref&gt;Justin Martyr. ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. Chapter LXXXI.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irenaeus]] (c. 115–202) assumes it as a conceded point. According to the ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible'', modern scholars are divided between the apostolic view and several alternative hypotheses put forth in the last hundred years or so.&lt;ref&gt;Tenney, Merrill C., gen. ed. (2009). "Revelation, Book of the". ''Zondervan Pictorial Encyclopedia of the Bible, Vol. 5 (Q-Z)''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: Zondervan.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ben Witherington]] points out that linguistic evidence makes it unlikely that the books were written by the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Witherington, Ben (2003). ''Revelation''. Cambridge University Press. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates of composition==
:''See individual book articles for more detail.''
The earliest works that became part of the New Testament are the letters of the Apostle Paul. The earliest of the books of the New Testament was [[First Thessalonians]], an epistle of [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]], written probably in 51, or possibly [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] in 49 according to one of two theories of its writing.

In the 1830s German scholars of the [[Tübingen school]] tried to date the books as late as the 3rd century, but the discovery of some [[Biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]] and fragments from the 2nd and 3rd centuries, one of which dates as early as 125 ([[Papyrus 52]]), disproves a 3rd-century date of composition for any book now in the New Testament. Additionally, a [[First Epistle of Clement|letter to the church at Corinth]] in the name of [[Clement I|Clement of Rome]] in 95 quotes from 10 of the 27 books of the New Testament, and a [[Polycarp's letter to the Philippians|letter to the church at Philippi in the name of Polycarp]] in 120 quotes from 16 books.  Therefore, some of the books of the New Testament must have been in circulation by the end of the first century.

Scholars hold a wide spectrum of views on exactly when the books of the new testament were written, with non-fundamentalist scholars tending to argue for later dates, and more conservative scholars arguing for an earlier one.  Most contemporary scholars regard [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] as a source used by Luke (see [[Marcan priority]]).&lt;ref&gt;Koester, Helmut (1999). ''Ancient Christian Gospels''. Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Trinity Press International. p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; If it is true that Mark was written around the destruction of the [[Temple of Jerusalem]], around 70,&lt;ref name = "TM1998 Mark"&gt;Theissen, Gerd; Merz, Annette (1996). ''The Historical Jesus: A Comprehensive Guide''. Fortress Press. (1996 edition). p. 24-27.&lt;/ref&gt; they theorize that Luke would not have been written before 70. Some who take this view believe that Luke's prediction of the destruction of the temple could not be a result of Jesus predicting the future but with the benefit of hindsight regarding specific details. They believe that the [[Olivet Discourse]] in {{Bibleref2|Luke|21:5–30}} is specific enough (more specific than Mark's or Matthew's) that a date after 70 seems likely.&lt;ref name="ODCC self Matthew"&gt;Cross, F. L., ed. (2005). "Matthew, Gospel according to St". ''The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=note|S. Brown agrees that the references to the Jerusalem temple's destruction are seen as evidence of a post-70 date.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler. (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}} These scholars have suggested dates for Luke from 75 to 100.

Support for a later date comes from a number of reasons. Differences of chronology, "style", and theology suggest that the author of Luke-Acts was not familiar with [[Pauline Christianity|Paul's distinctive theology]] but instead was writing a decade or more after his death, by which point significant harmonization between different traditions within [[Early Christianity]] had occurred.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Luke-Acts has views on [[christology|Jesus' divine nature]], [[eschatology|the end times]], and [[soteriology|salvation]] that are similar to those found in [[Pastoral epistles]], which are often seen as [[pseudonym]]ous and of a later date than [[Authorship of the Pauline Epistles|the undisputed]] [[Pauline Epistles]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Schuyler (1993). ''The Origins of Christianity: A Historical Introduction to the New Testament''. New York: Oxford University Press. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most conservative scholars however, argue that both [[internal evidence|internal]] and [[external evidence|external]] evidence strongly points to dates prior to 70 AD for the [[Synoptic Gospels]], [[Book of Acts|Acts]], and the [[Pauline Epistles]].  They note that there is no mention of the deaths of [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], [[Saint Peter|Peter]], and [[James the Just|James]], all of which happened between 60–65 AD, in any book of the New Testament.  These were all extremely important figures in the [[Early Christianity|early church]], writers would have mentioned their deaths if the New Testament had been written later.&lt;ref name ="Robinson" /&gt;  Furthermore, the Gospels contain numerous attacks on the [[Sadducees]], a sect of Judaism that was wiped out with the destruction of the temple.  Why, they ask, would later writers devote so much narrative space to attacking a group that no longer existed?&lt;ref name="Wallace"&gt;{{cite web

[[John Robinson (bishop of Woolwich)|John Robinson]] also notes that each book of the New Testament had to be written prior to the destruction of The Temple.  Robinson notes that most scholars interpret the [[Olivet Discourse]] as a post 70 AD account of the [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|destruction of The Temple]], couched in language to make it appear to be a prophecy, culminating in the [[Second Coming]] of Jesus to end the world.  Robinson notes that the Second Coming did not occur after the destruction of The Temple, leading him to ask, why would a writer in the 80s or 90s forge a prophecy of an event that is proven not to have occurred 20 years earlier?&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;{{cite book| first = John Arthur Thomas | last = Robinson|title= Redating the New Testament|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CSMFAAAACAAJ|date= 1 October 2000| origyear = 1976 | publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock |isbn=978-1-57910-527-3 | author-mask = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
{{main article|Language of the New Testament}}
The major languages spoken by both Jews and Greeks in the [[Holy Land]] at the [[Cultural and historical background of Jesus|time of Jesus]] were [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]], and also a colloquial dialect of [[Mishnaic Hebrew]]. It is generally agreed by most scholars that the [[historical Jesus]] primarily spoke [[Aramaic of Jesus|Aramaic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary|title=Aramaic|quote=It is generally agreed that Aramaic was the common language of Israel in the 1st century AD.

Eerdmans|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps also some [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek]]. The majority view is that all of the books that would eventually form the New Testament were written in the Koine Greek language.&lt;ref&gt;Metzger, Bruce M.; Ehrman, Bart D. (2005).

''The Text of the New Testament''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing. {{ISBN|9780802840981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Early centers of Christianity|As Christianity spread]], these books were later translated into other languages, most notably, [[Latin]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Coptic language|Egyptian Coptic]]. However, some of the [[Church Fathers]]&lt;ref&gt;Koester, Helmut (1982). ''Introduction to the New Testament, Volume 2''. Philadelphia. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; imply or claim that Matthew was originally written in [[Hebrew Gospel of Matthew|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic Matthew|Aramaic]], and then soon after was written in Koine Greek. Nevertheless, the Gospel of Matthew known today was composed in Greek and is neither directly dependent upon nor a translation of a text in a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, W. D.; Allison, Dale C. (1988). ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on The Gospel according to Saint Matthew, Vol. 1''. Edinburgh: T&amp;T Clark. pp. 33–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the New Testament canon==
{{Main article|Development of the New Testament canon}}
The process of canonization of the New Testament was complex and lengthy. In the initial centuries of [[early Christianity]], there were many books widely considered by the church to be inspired, but there was no single formally recognized New Testament canon.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. "Chapter 25". [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/250103.htm ''Church History, Book III''].&lt;/ref&gt; The process was characterized by a compilation of books that [[Sacred tradition|apostolic tradition]] considered authoritative in worship and teaching, relevant to the historical situations in which they lived, and consonant with the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Harry Y. (1985). ''The New Testament Canon: Its Making and Meaning''. Guides to Biblical Scholarship. Philadelphia: Fortress.&lt;/ref&gt; Writings attributed to the apostles circulated among the [[Early centers of Christianity|earliest Christian communities]] and the Pauline epistles were circulating, perhaps in collected forms, by the end of the [[Christianity in the 1st century|1st century AD]].&lt;ref&gt;Three forms are postulated, from ''The Canon Debate'', chapter 18, page 300, note 21, attributed to Harry Y. Gamble: "(1) Marcion's collection that begins with Galatians and ends with Philemon; (2) Papyrus 46, dated about 200, that follows the order that became established except for reversing Ephesians and Galatians; and (3) the letters to seven churches, treating those to the same church as one letter and basing the order on length, so that Corinthians is first and Colossians (perhaps including Philemon) is last."&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest attempts at solidifying a canon was made by [[Marcion]], ''circa'' 140 AD, who accepted only a modified version of Luke (the [[Gospel of Marcion]]) and ten of Paul's letters, while rejecting the Old Testament entirely. His canon was increasingly rejected by other groups of Christians, notably the [[Proto-orthodox Christianity|proto-orthodox Christians]], as was his theology, [[Marcionism]]. [[Adolf Harnack]] in ''Origin of the New Testament'' (1914) observed that the church gradually formulated its New Testament canon in response to the challenge posed by Marcion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harnack |first=Adolf |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/harnack/origin_nt.v.vi.html |title=Origin of the New Testament |chapter=Appendix VI |publisher=Christian Classics Ethereal Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Justin Martyr]], [[Irenaeus]] and [[Tertullian]] held the letters of Paul to be on par with the Hebrew Scriptures as being divinely inspired, yet others rejected him. Other books were held in high esteem but were gradually relegated to the status of [[New Testament apocrypha]]. Justin Martyr, in the mid [[Christianity in the 2nd century|2nd century]], mentions "memoirs of the apostles" as being read on Sunday alongside the [[Nevi'im|"writings of the prophets"]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Justin Martyr. [http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/0126.htm ''First Apology'']. Chapter 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Muratorian fragment]], dated at between 170 and as late as the end of the 4th century (according to the [[Anchor Bible Series#Anchor Bible Dictionary|Anchor Bible Dictionary]]), may be the earliest known New Testament canon attributed to mainstream Christianity. It is similar, but not identical, to the modern New Testament canon.

The oldest clear endorsement of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John being the only legitimate gospels was written ''circa'' 180 AD. A four gospel canon (the ''Tetramorph'') was asserted by Irenaeus, who refers to it directly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ferguson |first=Everett |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kxW-AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT345 |chapter=Factors leading to the Selection and Closure of the New Testament Canon |editor-last1=McDonald |editor-first1=L.

[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.iv.xii.html "Chapter XI"]. ''Against Heresies, Book III''. Section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; in his [[polemic]] ''Against the Heresies'', "It is not possible that the gospels can be either more or fewer in number than they are. For, since there are four zones of the world in which we live, and four principal winds, while the church is scattered throughout all the world, and the "pillar and ground" of the church is the gospel and the spirit of life; it is fitting that she should have four pillars, breathing out immortality on every side, and vivifying men afresh."&lt;ref name=AHIII8/&gt; The books considered to be authoritative by Irenaeus included the four gospels and many of the letters of Paul, although, based on the arguments Irenaeus made in support of only four authentic gospels, some interpreters deduce that the fourfold Gospel must have still been a novelty in Irenaeus's time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=McDonald |editor-first1=L. M |editor-last2=Sanders |editor-first2=J. A. |year=2002 |title=The Canon Debate |publisher=Hendrickson |page=277 |ref={{harvid|McDonald|Sanders|2002}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origen (3rd century)===
By the early 200s, [[Origen]] may have been using the same twenty-seven books as in the Catholic New Testament canon, though there were still disputes over the canonicity of the Letter to the Hebrews, Epistle of James, II Peter, II John and III John and the Book of Revelation,&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Mark A. (1997). ''Turning Points''. Baker Academic. pp 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt; known as the [[Antilegomena]]. Likewise, the [[Muratorian fragment]] is evidence that, perhaps as early as 200, there existed a set of Christian writings somewhat similar to the twenty-seven book NT canon, which included four gospels and argued against objections to them.&lt;ref&gt;de Jonge, H. J. (2003). "The New Testament Canon". In de Jonge, H. J.; Auwers, J. M (eds.). ''The Biblical Canons''. Leuven University Press. p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while there was a good measure of debate in the [[Early Church]] over the New Testament canon, the major writings are claimed to have been accepted by almost all Christians by the middle of the [[Christianity in the 3rd century|3rd century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Cambridge History of the Bible, Vol. 1 |author=Ackroyd, P. R.; Evans, C. F. (eds.) |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1970 |page=308 |ref={{harvid|Ackroyd|Evans|1970}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Origen was largely responsible for the collection of usage information regarding the texts that became the New Testament. The information used to create the late-4th-century [[Easter Letter]], which declared accepted Christian writings, was probably based on the ''Ecclesiastical History'' [HE] of [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], wherein he uses the information passed on to him by Origen to create both his list at HE 3:25 and Origen's list at HE 6:25. Eusebius got his information about what texts were then accepted and what were then [[Antilegomena|disputed]], by the [[Early centers of Christianity|third-century churches throughout the known world]], a great deal of which Origen knew of firsthand from his extensive travels, from the library and writings of Origen.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, C. G. (2010). [http://ssrn.com/abstract=1653073 "Origen’s Role in the Formation of the New Testament Canon"]. Social Science Research Network.&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, Origen would have possibly included in his list of "inspired writings" other texts kept out by the likes of Eusebius—including the [[Epistle of Barnabas]], [[Shepherd of Hermas]], and [[1 Clement]]. Notwithstanding these facts, "Origen is not the originator of the idea of biblical canon, but he certainly gives the philosophical and literary-interpretative underpinnings for the whole notion."&lt;ref&gt;McGuckin, John A. (2003). "Origen as Literary Critic in the Alexandrian Tradition". In Perrone, L. (ed.). ''Origeniana Octava: Origen and the Alexandrian Tradition, Vol. 1''. Bibliotheca Ephemeridum Theologicarum Lovaniensium 164. Leuven: Leuven University Press. pp. 121–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eusebius's Ecclesiastical History===
[[Eusebius]], ''circa'' 300, gave a detailed list of New Testament writings in his ''Ecclesiastical History'' [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-01/Npnf2-01-08.htm#P1497_696002 Book 3], Chapter XXV:
: "1... First then must be put the holy quaternion of the gospels; following them the Acts of the Apostles... the epistles of Paul... the epistle of John... the epistle of Peter... After them is to be placed, if it really seem proper, the Book of Revelation, concerning which we shall give the different opinions at the proper time. These then belong among the accepted writings."

: "3 Among the disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many, are extant the so-called epistle of James and that of Jude, also the second epistle of Peter, and those that are called the second and third of John, whether they belong to the evangelist or to another person of the same name. Among the rejected [Kirsopp Lake translation: "not genuine"] writings must be reckoned also the [[Acts of Paul]], and the so-called [[Shepherd of Hermas|Shepherd]], and the [[Apocalypse of Peter]], and in addition to these the extant [[epistle of Barnabas]], and the so-called [[Didache|Teachings of the Apostles]]; and besides, as I said, the [[Book of Revelation|Apocalypse of John]], if it seem proper, which some, as I said, reject, but which others class with the accepted books. And among these some have placed also the [[Gospel of the Hebrews|Gospel according to the Hebrews]]... And all these may be reckoned among the disputed books."

: "6... such books as the [[Gospel of Peter|Gospels of Peter]], of [[Gospel of Thomas|Thomas]], of [[Gospel of Matthias|Matthias]], or of any others besides them, and the [[Acts of Andrew]] and [[Acts of John|John]] and the other apostles... they clearly show themselves to be the fictions of heretics. Wherefore they are not to be placed even among the rejected writings, but are all of them to be cast aside as absurd and impious."

The Book of Revelation is counted as both accepted (Kirsopp Lake translation: "Recognized") and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so. From other writings of the church fathers, it was disputed with several canon lists rejecting its canonicity. EH 3.3.5 adds further detail on Paul: "Paul's fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, saying that it is disputed by the church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul." EH 4.29.6 mentions the [[Diatessaron]]: "But their original founder, Tatian, formed a certain combination and collection of the gospels, I know not how, to which he gave the title Diatessaron, and which is still in the hands of some. But they say that he ventured to paraphrase certain words of the apostle Paul, in order to improve their style."

===4th century and later===
In his Easter letter of 367, [[Athanasius]], Bishop of Alexandria, gave a list of the books that would become the twenty-seven-book NT canon,&lt;ref name="LindbergCarter"&gt;{{cite book|title=A Brief History of Christianity |first=Carter |last=Lindberg |page=15|year=2006|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|isbn=1-4051-1078-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he used the word "canonized" (''kanonizomena'') in regards to them.&lt;ref&gt;Brakke, David (Oct 1994). "Canon Formation and Social Conflict in Fourth Century Egypt: Athanasius of Alexandria's Thirty Ninth Festal Letter". ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''87''' (4): 395–419.&lt;/ref&gt; The first council that accepted the present canon of the New Testament may have been the [[Synod of Hippo|Synod of Hippo Regius]] in North Africa (393 AD); the acts of this council, however, are lost. A brief summary of the acts was read at and accepted by the [[Council of Carthage (397)]] and the [[Council of Carthage (419)]].&lt;ref name=McDonaldD2&gt;{{harvp|McDonald|Sanders|2002|loc=Appendix D-2, note 19}} "Revelation was added later in 419 at the subsequent synod of Carthage."&lt;/ref&gt; These councils were under the authority of [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]], who regarded the canon as already closed.&lt;ref name=Ferguson320&gt;{{harvp|Ferguson|2002|p=320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=F. F. |year=1988 |title=The Canon of Scripture |publisher=Intervarsity Press |page=230 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augustine. ''De Civitate Dei''. 22.8.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Damasus I]]'s [[Council of Rome]] in 382, if the ''[[Decretum Gelasianum]]'' is correctly associated with it, issued a biblical canon identical to that mentioned above,&lt;ref name="LindbergCarter" /&gt; or, if not, the list is at least a 6th-century compilation.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1988 234"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, Damasus' commissioning of the Latin [[Vulgate]] edition of the Bible, c. 383, was instrumental in the fixation of the canon in the West.&lt;ref name="Bruce 1988 225"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=225}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''c.'' 405, [[Pope Innocent I]] sent a list of the sacred books to a Gallic bishop, [[Exuperius|Exsuperius of Toulouse]]. Christian scholars assert that, when these [[bishops]] and councils spoke on the matter, however, they were not defining something new but instead "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church."&lt;ref name=Ferguson320/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger 1987 237–238"&gt;{{cite book |first=Bruce |last=Metzger |title=The Canon of the New Testament: Its Origins, Development, and Significance |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon |year=1987 |pages=237–238 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce"&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament canon as it is now was first listed by [[Athanasius of Alexandria|St. Athanasius, Bishop of Alexandria]], in 367, in a letter written to his churches in Egypt, [http://www.ccel.org/fathers2/NPNF2-04/Npnf2-04-93.htm Festal Letter 39]. Also cited is the [[Council of Rome]], but not without controversy. That canon gained wider and wider recognition until it was accepted at the [[Third Council of Carthage]] in 397 and 419.{{refn|group=note|The [[Book of Revelation]] wasn't added till the [[Council of Carthage (419)]].&lt;ref name=McDonaldD2/&gt;}}

Even this council did not settle the matter, however. Certain books, referred to as [[Antilegomena]], continued to be questioned, especially [[Epistle of James|James]] and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]. Even as late as the 16th century, the Reformer [[Martin Luther]] questioned (but in the end did not reject) the [[Epistle of James]], the [[Epistle of Jude]], the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] and the [[Book of Revelation]]. To this day, German-language [[Luther Bible]]s are printed with these four books at the end of the canon, rather than in their traditional order as in other editions of the Bible.

In light of this questioning of the canon of Scripture by Protestants in the 16th century, the (Roman Catholic) [[Council of Trent]] reaffirmed the traditional western canon (i.e., the canon accepted at the 4th-century [[Council of Rome]] and [[Council of Carthage]]), thus making the [[Canon of Trent]] and the [[Vulgate]] Bible [[Roman Catholic Dogma|dogma]] in the Catholic Church. Later, [[Pope Pius XI]] on 2 June 1927 decreed the [[Comma Johanneum]] was open to dispute and [[Pope Pius XII]] on 3 September 1943 issued the encyclical ''[[Divino afflante Spiritu]]'', which allowed translations based on other versions than just the Latin [[Vulgate]], notably in English the [[New American Bible]].

Thus, some claim that, from the [[Christianity in the 4th century#Defining scripture|4th century]], there existed unanimity in the [[Western Church|West]] concerning the New Testament canon (as it is today),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Bruce|1988|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, by the [[Christianity in the 5th century|5th century]], the [[Eastern Church]], with a few exceptions, had come to accept the [[Book of Revelation]] and thus had come into harmony on the matter of the canon.&lt;ref name="P. R. Ackroyd and C. F. Evans, eds. 1970 305"&gt;{{harvp|Ackroyd|Evans|1970|p=305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, full dogmatic articulations of the canon were not made until the [[Canon of Trent]] of 1546 for [[Roman Catholicism]], the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for the [[Greek Orthodox]].

On the question of NT Canon formation generally, New Testament scholar Lee Martin McDonald has written that:&lt;ref&gt;McDonald, Lee M. (1995). ''The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon''. Peabody, Massachusetts: Hendrickson. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Although a number of Christians have thought that [[church council]]s determined what books were to be included in the biblical canons, a more accurate reflection of the matter is that the councils recognized or acknowledged those books that had already obtained prominence from usage among the various early Christian communities.}}

Christian scholars assert that when these bishops and councils spoke on the matter, they were not defining something new, but instead "were ratifying what had already become the mind of the Church".&lt;ref name="Metzger 1987 237–238"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bruce" /&gt;

Some synods of the 4th century published lists of canonical books (e.g. [[Synod of Hippo|Hippo]] and [[Council of Carthage|Carthage]]). The existing 27-book canon of the New Testament was reconfirmed (for [[Roman Catholicism]]) in the 16th century with the [[Council of Trent]] (also called the Tridentine Council) of 1546,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Metzger|1987|p=246}} "Finally on 8 April 1546, by a vote of 24 to 15, with 16 abstensions, the Council issued a decree (''De Canonicis Scripturis'') in which, for the first time in the history of the church, the question of the contents of the Bible was made an absolute article of faith and confirmed by an anathema."&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Thirty-Nine Articles]] of 1563 for the [[Church of England]], the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]] of 1647 for [[Calvinism]], and the [[Synod of Jerusalem]] of 1672 for [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]. Although these councils did include statements about the canon, when it came to the New Testament they were only reaffirming the existing canon, including the [[Antilegomena]].

According to the ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' article on the Canon of the New Testament: "The idea of a complete and clear-cut canon of the New Testament existing from the beginning, that is from Apostolic times, has no foundation in history. The Canon of the New Testament, like that of the Old, is the result of a development, of a process at once stimulated by disputes with doubters, both within and without the Church, and retarded by certain obscurities and natural hesitations, and which did not reach its final term until the dogmatic definition of the [[Council of Trent|Tridentine Council]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Reid |first=George |year=1908 |chapter-url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/03274a.htm |chapter=Canon of the New Testament |title=The Catholic Encyclopedia |location=New York |publisher=Robert Appleton Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 331, [[Constantine I and Christianity|Constantine I]] commissioned Eusebius to deliver [[Fifty Bibles of Constantine|fifty Bibles]] for the [[Church of Constantinople]]. [[Athanasius]] (''Apol. Const. 4'') recorded Alexandrian scribes around 340 preparing Bibles for [[Constans]]. Little else is known, though there is plenty of speculation. For example, it is speculated that this may have provided motivation for canon lists, and that [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus]] may be examples of these Bibles. Together with the [[Peshitta]] and [[Codex Alexandrinus]], these are the earliest extant Christian Bibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|McDonald|Sanders|2002|pp=414–415}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence among the [[First Council of Nicaea#The biblical canon|canons of the First Council of Nicaea of any determination on the canon]].

==Early manuscripts==

{{Main article|New Testament manuscripts}}

Like other literature from [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], the text of the New Testament was (prior to the advent of the [[printing press]]) preserved and transmitted in [[manuscripts]]. Manuscripts containing at least a part of the New Testament number in the thousands. The earliest of these (like manuscripts containing other literature) are often very fragmentarily preserved. Some of these fragments have even been thought to date as early as the 2nd century (i.e., [[Papyrus 90]], [[Papyrus 98]], [[Papyrus 104]], and famously [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52]], though the early date of the latter has recently been called into question).&lt;ref&gt;For the initial dating of P52, see Roberts, C. H. (ed.) (1935). ''An Unpublished Fragment of the Fourth Gospel in the John Rylands Library''. Manchester: Manchester University Press; and Bell, H. Idris; Skeat, T. C. (1935). ''Fragments of an Unknown Gospel and Other Early Christian Papyri''. London: Trustees of the British Museum. Though see now Nongbri, Brent (2005). "The Use and Abuse of P52: Papyrological Pitfalls in the Dating of the Fourth Gospel". ''Harvard Theological Review'' '''98''': 23–52; and Martinez, David G. (2009). "The Papyri and Early Christianity". In Bagnall, Roger S. (ed.). ''The Oxford Handbook of Papyrology''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 590–623.&lt;/ref&gt;

For each subsequent century, more and more manuscripts survive that contain a portion or all of the books that were held to be part of the New Testament at that time (for example, the New Testament of the 4th-century [[Codex Sinaiticus]], once a complete Bible, contains the [[Epistle of Barnabas]] and the [[Shepherd of Hermas]]), though occasionally these manuscripts contain other works as well (e.g., [[Papyrus 72]] and the Crosby-Schøyen Codex). The date when a manuscript was written, however, does not necessarily reflect the date of the form of text it contains. That is, later manuscripts can, and occasionally do, contain older forms of text or older readings.

Some of the more important manuscripts containing an early text of books of the New Testament are:

*The [[Chester Beatty Papyri]] (Greek; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd century)
*The [[Bodmer Papyri]] (Greek and Coptic; the New Testament portions of which were copied in the 3rd and 4th centuries)
*[[Codex Bobiensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century, but containing at least a 3rd-century form of text)
*[[Uncial 0171|Uncial '''0171''']] (Greek; copied in the late-third or early 4th century)
*[[Syriac Sinaiticus]] (Syriac; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Schoyen Collection|Schøyen Manuscript]] 2560 (Coptic; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Vaticanus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Sinaiticus]] (Greek; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Codex Vercellensis]] (Latin; copied in the 4th century)
*[[Curetonian Gospels]] (Syriac; copied in the 5th century)
*[[Garima Gospels]] ( [[Ge'ez language]], produced in the 5th through 6th century)

==Textual variation==
{{Main article|Textual variants in the New Testament|Textual criticism of the New Testament}}
[[Textual criticism]] deals with the identification and removal of [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] errors in the [[Writing|texts]] of [[manuscripts]]. Ancient [[scribes]] made errors or alterations (such as including non-authentic [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|additions]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Ehrman|2005|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Testament has been preserved in more than 5,800 [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Ethiopic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. Even if the [[Greek New Testament|original Greek]] versions were lost, the entire New Testament could still be assembled from the translations.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"&gt;Strobel, Lee (1998). ''The Case for Christ''. Chapter Three, when quoting biblical scholar [[Bruce Metzger]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are so many quotes from the New Testament in early church documents and commentaries that the entire New Testament could also be assembled from these alone.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt; Not all biblical manuscripts come from orthodox Christian writers. For example, the [[Gnostic]] writings of [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] come from the 2nd century AD, and these Christians were regarded as heretics by the mainstream church.&lt;ref name="Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=F.F. |year=1981 |title=The New Testament Documents: Are They Reliable? |publisher=InterVarsity Press |page=14 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sheer number of witnesses presents unique difficulties, but it also gives scholars a better idea of how close modern Bibles are to the original versions.&lt;ref name="Bruce, F.F. 1981 P 14"/&gt;

On noting the large number of surviving ancient manuscripts, [[Bruce Metzger]] sums up the view on the issue by saying "The more often you have copies that agree with each other, especially if they emerge from different geographical areas, the more you can cross-check them to figure out what the original document was like. The only way they'd agree would be where they went back genealogically in a family tree that represents the descent of the manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt;

===Interpolations===
In attempting to determine the original text of the New Testament books, some modern textual critics have identified sections as additions of material, centuries after the gospel was written. These are called [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolations]]. In modern translations of the Bible, the results of textual criticism have led to certain verses, words and phrases being left out or marked as not original. According to [[Bart D. Ehrman]], "These scribal additions are often found in late medieval manuscripts of the New Testament, but not in the manuscripts of the earlier centuries."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrman |first=Bart D. |authorlink=Bart D. Ehrman |year=2005 |title=Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why |titlelink=Misquoting Jesus |publisher=HarperCollins |page=265 |isbn=978-0-06-073817-4 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most modern Bibles have footnotes to indicate passages that have disputed source documents. Bible Commentaries also discuss these, sometimes in great detail. While many variations have been discovered between early copies of biblical texts, almost all have no importance, as they are variations in spelling, punctuation, or grammar. Also, many of these variants are so particular to the Greek language that they would not appear in translations into other languages. For example, order of words (i.e. "man bites dog" versus "dog bites man") often does not matter in Greek, so textual variants that flip the order of words often have no consequences.&lt;ref name="Strobel, Lee 1998"/&gt;

Outside of these unimportant variants, there are a couple variants of some importance. The two most commonly cited examples are the [[Mark 16|last verses]] of the ''Gospel of Mark''&lt;ref&gt;Nave, Guy D.

[[File:RossanoGospelsChristBeforePilate.jpg|thumb|The [[Rossano Gospels]], 6th century, a representative of [[Byzantine]] text.]]

The often referred to Interpreter's Dictionary of the Bible, a book written to prove the validity of the New Testament, says: " A study of 150 Greek [manuscripts] of the Gospel of Luke has revealed more than 30,000 different readings... It is safe to say that there is not one sentence in the New Testament in which the [manuscript] is wholly uniform."&lt;ref&gt;Parvis, M. M. Vol. 4. pp. 594–595.{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the variation took place within the first three Christian centuries.

===Text-types===
By the 4th century, textual "families" or types of text become discernible among [[biblical manuscript|New Testament manuscripts]]. A "text-type" is the name given to a family of texts with similar readings due to common ancestors and mutual correction. Many early manuscripts, however, contain individual readings from several different earlier forms of text. Modern texual critics have identified the following text-types among textual witnesses to the New Testament: The [[Alexandrian text-type]] is usually considered to generally preserve many early readings. It is represented, e.g., by [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and the [[Bodmer Papyri]].

The [[Western text-type]] is generally longer and can be paraphrastic, but can also preserve early readings. The [[Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts|Western version of the Acts of the Apostles]] is, notably, 8.5% longer than the Alexandrian form of the text. Examples of the Western text are found in [[Codex Bezae]], [[Codex Claromontanus]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]], the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] (i.e., Latin translations made prior to the [[Vulgate]]), as well as in quotations by [[Marcion]], [[Tatian]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Cyprian]].

A text-type referred to as the "[[Caesarean text-type]]" and thought to have included witnesses such as [[Codex Koridethi]] and minuscule 565, can today be described neither as "Caesarean" nor as a text-type as was previously thought. However, the Gospel of Mark in [[Papyrus 45]], [[Codex Washingtonianus]] and in [[Family 13]] does indeed reflect a distinct type of text.

Increasing standardization of distinct (and once local) text-types eventually gave rise to the [[Byzantine text-type]]. Since most manuscripts of the New Testament do not derive from the first several centuries, that is, they were copied after the rise of the Byzantine text-type, this form of text is found the majority of extant manuscripts and is therefore often called the "Majority Text." As with all of the other (earlier) text-types, the Byzantine can also occasionally preserve early readings.

===Biblical criticism===
{{Main article|Biblical criticism}}
[[Biblical criticism]] is the scholarly "study and investigation of [[Biblical manuscript|biblical writings]] that seeks to make discerning judgments about these writings." Viewing biblical texts as having human rather than supernatural origins, it asks when and where a particular text originated; how, why, by whom, for whom, and in what circumstances it was produced; what influences were at work in its production; what sources were used in its composition; and what message it was intended to convey.

It will vary slightly depending on whether the focus is on the [[Old Testament]], the letters of the New Testament, or the [[Canonical Gospels]]. It also plays an important role in the quest for the [[historical Jesus]]. It also addresses the physical text, including the meaning of the words and the way in which they are used, its preservation, history, and integrity. Biblical criticism draws upon a wide range of scholarly disciplines including [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]], [[folklore]], [[linguistics]], [[Christian Oral Tradition|Oral Tradition studies]], history, and [[religious studies]].

===Establishing a critical text===
{{Main article|New Testament manuscripts}}
The [[#Textual variation|textual variation]] among manuscript copies of books in the New Testament prompted attempts to discern the earliest form of text already in antiquity (e.g., by the 3rd-century Christian author [[Origen]]). The efforts began in earnest again during the [[Renaissance]], which saw a revival of the study of ancient Greek texts. During this period, modern [[textual criticism]] was born. In this context, [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] such as [[Lorenzo Valla]] and [[Erasmus]] promoted a return to the original Greek of the New Testament. This was the beginning of modern [[New Testament textual criticism]], which over subsequent centuries would increasingly incorporate more and more manuscripts, in more languages (i.e., versions of the New Testament), as well as citations of the New Testament by ancient authors and the New Testament text in [[lectionary|lectionaries]] in order to reconstruct the earliest recoverable form of the New Testament text and the history of changes to it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce M. Metzger|Metzger, Bruce M.]]; [[Bart D. Ehrman|Ehrman, Bart D.]] (2005). ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration''. 4th ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to earlier and contemporaneous literature==
{{Further information|Non-canonical books referenced in the Bible}}
Books that later formed the New Testament, like other Christian literature of the period, originated in a literary context that reveals relationships not only to other Christian writings, but also to [[Classics|Graeco-Roman]] and [[Judaism#Antiquity|Jewish]] works. Of singular importance is the extensive use of and interaction with the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]] and what would become the [[Old Testament|Christian Old Testament]]. Both implicit and explicit citations, as well as countless allusions, appear throughout the books of the New Testament, from the Gospels and Acts, to the Epistles, to the Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Stendahl, Krister (1954). ''The School of St. Matthew and Its Use of the Old Testament''. Uppsala and Lund; Marcus, Joel (1993). ''The Way of the Lord: Christological Exegesis of the Old Testament in the Gospel of Mark''. Edinburgh; Smith, D. Moody (1972). "The Use of the Old Testament in the New". In ''The Use of the Old Testament in the New and Other Essays: Studies in Honor of William Franklin Stinespring''. Durham, North Carolina: Duke University Press. pp. 3–65; [[Donald Juel|Juel, Donald]] (1988). ''Messianic Exegesis: Christological Interpretation of the Old Testament in Early Christianity''. Philadelphia: Fortress; and Barr, James (1966). ''Old and New in Interpretation: A Study of the Two Testaments''. London: SCM.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early versions==
The first translations (usually called "versions") of the New Testament were made beginning already at the end of 2nd century. The earliest versions of the New Testament are the translations into the [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Latin]], and [[Coptic language|Coptic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur Võõbus|Võõbus, Arthur]] (1954). ''Early Versions of the New Testament''. Stockholm. pp. 1–128, 211–240.&lt;/ref&gt; These three versions were made directly from the Greek, and are frequently cited in the apparatuses of modern critical editions.

===Syriac===
{{Main article|Syriac versions of the Bible}}
[[File:RabulaGospelsFolio04vCanonTable.jpg|thumb|The [[Rabbula Gospels]], [[Eusebian Canons]].]]
Syriac was spoken in [[Syria]], and [[Mesopotamia]], and with dialect in [[Syria Palaestina|Roman]] and [[Palaestina Secunda|Byzantine Palestine]] where it was known as [[Jewish Palestinian Aramaic]]. Several Syriac translations were made and have come to us. Most of the Old Syriac, however, as well as the Philoxonian version have been lost.

[[Tatian]], the Assyrian, created the [[Diatessaron]], a [[gospel harmony]] written in Syriac around 170 AD and the earliest form of the gospel not only in Syriac but probably also in Armenian.

In the 19th century, manuscript evidence was discovered for an "Old Syriac" version of the four distinct (i.e., not harmonized) gospels. These "separated" (Syriac: ''da-Mepharreshe'') gospels, though old, have been shown to be later than the Diatessaron. The Old Syriac gospels are fragmentarily preserved in two manuscripts: the 5th-century [[Curetonian Gospels|Curetonian Syriac]] and the [[Syriac Sinaiticus|Sinaitic Syriac]] from the 4th or 5th century.

No Old Syriac manuscripts of other portions of the New Testament survive, though Old Syriac readings, e.g. from the [[Pauline Epistles]], can be discerned in citations made by Eastern fathers and in later Syriac versions. The Old Syriac version is a representative of the [[Western text-type]]. The [[Peshitta]] version was prepared in the beginning of the 5th century. It contains only 22 books (neither the [[General epistles|Minor Catholic Epistles]] of 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, and Jude, nor the [[Book of Revelation]] were part of this translation).

The [[Philoxenian]] probably was produced in 508 for [[Philoxenus, Bishop of Mabung]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzger |first=Bruce M. |authorlink=Bruce M. Metzger |year=1977 |title=The Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Oxford |publisher=Clarendon Press |pages=3–98 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin===
{{Main article|Vetus Latina|Vulgate}}
The Gospels were likely translated into Latin as early as the last quarter of the 2nd century in North Africa (''Afra''). Not much later, there were also European Latin translations (''Itala''). There are about 80 Old Latin mansucripts. The [[Vetus Latina]] ("Old Latin") versions often contain readings with a Western type of text. (For the avoidance of confusion, these texts were written in [[Late Latin]], not the early version of the Latin language known as [[Old Latin]], pre 75 BC.)

The bewildering diversity of the Old Latin versions prompted [[Jerome]] to prepare another translation into Latin&amp;nbsp;— the [[Vulgate]]. In many respects it was merely a revision of the Old Latin. There are currently around 8,000 manuscripts of the Vulgate.

===Coptic===
{{Main article|Coptic versions of the Bible}}
There are several dialects of the Coptic language: [[Bohairic]] (northern dialect), [[Fayyumic]], [[Sahidic]] (southern dialect), [[Akhmimic]], and others. The first translation was made by at least the 3rd century into the Sahidic dialect (cop&lt;sup&gt;sa&lt;/sup&gt;). This translation represents a mixed text, mostly [[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]], though also with [[Western text-type|Western]] readings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vööbus |first=Arthur |year=1954 |title=Early Versions of the New Testament |location=Stockholm |pages=216–229 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Bohairic translation was made later, but existed already in the 4th century. Though the translation makes less use of Greek words than the Sahidic, it does employ some Greek grammar (e.g., in word-order and the use of particles such as the syntactic construction μεν&amp;nbsp;— δε). For this reason, the Bohairic translation can be helpful in the reconstruction of the early Greek text of the New Testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vööbus|1954|pp=229–237}}; {{harvp|Metzger|1977|pp=99–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other ancient translations===
[[File:Matthew's Gospel - British Library Add. MS 59874 Ethiopian Bible.jpg|thumb|BL Add. MS 59874 with [[Ethiopic]] [[Gospel of Matthew]].]]
The continued spread of Christianity, and the foundation of national churches, led to the translation of the Bible—often beginning with books from the New Testament—into a variety of other languages at a relatively early date: [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Ethiopic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Soghdian]], and eventually [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Church Slavonic language|Old Church Slavonic]], [[Arabic]], and [[Nubian languages|Nubian]].&lt;ref&gt;On the Armenian, Georgian, Ethiopic, Arabic, and Gothic, see {{harvp|Vööbus|1954|loc=pp. 133–210, 243–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern translations==
{{Main article|Bible translations}}
[[Modern Literal Version]] is the most recent literal translation of the books of the new testament, with the largest number of translation experts being involved in the final translation.

Historically, throughout the [[Christendom|Christian world]] and in the context of [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary activity]], the New Testament (or portions thereof) has been that part of the Christian Bible first translated into the [[vernacular]]. The production of such translations grew out of the insertion of [[vernacular]] [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] in biblical texts, as well as out of the production of [[biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]).

The 16th century saw the rise of [[Protestantism]] and an explosion of translations of the New (and Old) Testament into the [[vernacular]]. Notable are those of [[Luther Bible|Martin Luther]] (1522), [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]] (1523), the [[Zürich Bible|Froschau Bible]] (1525–1529, revised in 1574), [[Tyndale Bible|William Tyndale]] (1526, revised in 1534, 1535 and 1536), the [[Brest Bible]] (1563), and the [[Authorized King James Version|Authorized Version]] (also called the "King James Version") (1611).

Most of these translations relied (though not always exclusively) upon one of the printed editions of the Greek New Testament edited by [[Erasmus]], a form of this Greek text emerged as the standard and is known as the [[Textus Receptus]]. This text, based on the majority of manuscripts is also used in the majority of translations that were made in the years 100 to 400 AD.

Translations of the New Testament made since the appearance of critical editions of the Greek text (notably those of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]], [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]], and [[Von Soden catalogue|von Soden]]) have largely used them as their [[Source text|base text]]. Unlike the [[Textus Receptus]], these have a pronounced Alexandrian character. Standard critical editions are those of [[Alexander Souter|Souter]], Vogels, Bover, Merk, and [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestlé-Aland]] (the text, though not the full critical apparatus of which is reproduced in the [[United Bible Societies]]' "Greek New Testament").

Notable translations of the New Testament based on these most recent critical editions include the [[Revised Standard Version]] (1946, revised in 1971), [[:fr:La Bible de Jérusalem|La Bible de Jérusalem]] (1961, revised in 1973 and 2000), the [[Einheitsübersetzung]] (1970, final edition 1979), the [[New American Bible]] (1970, revised in 1986), the [[Traduction Oecuménique de la Bible]] (1988, revised in 2004), and the [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989).

==Theological interpretation in Christian churches==
{{Main article|Biblical authority}}
Though all Christian churches accept the New Testament as scripture, they differ in their understanding of the nature, extent, and relevance of its authority. Views of the authoritativeness of the New Testament often depend on the concept of ''[[Biblical inspiration|inspiration]]'', which relates to the role of God in the formation of the New Testament. Generally, the greater the role of God in one's doctrine of inspiration, the more one accepts the [[doctrine]] of [[biblical inerrancy]] or authoritativeness of the Bible. One possible source of confusion is that these terms are difficult to define, because many people use them interchangeably or with very different meanings. This article will use the terms in the following manner:
*''Infallibility'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in matters of doctrine.
*''Inerrancy'' relates to the absolute correctness of the Bible in factual assertions (including historical and scientific assertions).
*''Authoritativeness'' relates to the correctness of the Bible in questions of practice in morality.

{{Quotation|The self-witness of the Bible to its inspiration demands a commitment to its unity. The ultimate basis for unity is contained in the claim of divine inspiration in {{Bibleref2|2tim|3:16||2&amp;nbsp;Timothy 3:16}} that "all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (KJV). The term "inspiration" renders the Greek word ''theopneustos''. This term only occurs here in the New Testament and literally means "God-breathed" (the chosen translation of the NIV).&lt;ref name=Elwell&gt;Meadors, Gary T. (1997). [http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionaries/bakers-evangelical-dictionary/scripture-unity-and-diversity-of.html "Scripture, Unity and Diversity of"]. In Elwell, Walter A. (ed.). ''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology.'' Grand Rapids: Baker Books.&lt;/ref&gt;  }}

All of these concepts depend for their meaning on the supposition that the text of Bible has been properly interpreted, with consideration for the intention of the text, whether [[literal and figurative language|literal]] history, [[allegory]] or poetry, etc. Especially the doctrine of inerrancy is variously understood according to the weight given by the interpreter to scientific investigations of the world.

===Unity in diversity===
The notion of unity in diversity of Scripture claims that the Bible presents a noncontradictory and consistent message concerning God and redemptive history. The fact of diversity is observed in comparing the diversity of time, culture, authors' perspectives, literary genre, and the theological themes.&lt;ref name=Elwell/&gt;

Studies from many theologians considering the "unity in diversity" to be found in the New Testament (and the Bible as a whole) have been collected and summarized by New Testament theologian [[Frank Stagg (theologian)|Frank Stagg]]. He describes them as some basic presuppositions, tenets, and concerns common among the New Testament writers, giving to the New Testament its "unity in diversity":
#The reality of God is never argued but is always assumed and affirmed
#Jesus Christ is absolutely central: he is Lord and Savior, the foretold Prophet, the Messianic King, the Chosen, the way, the truth, and the light, the One through whom God the Father not only acted but through whom He came
#The Holy Spirit came anew with Jesus Christ.
#The Christian faith and life are a calling, rooted in divine election.
#The plight of everyone as sinner means that each person is completely dependent upon the mercy and grace of God
#Salvation is both God's gift and his demand through Jesus Christ, to be received by faith
#The death and resurrection of Jesus are at the heart of the total event of which he was the center
#God creates a people of his own, designated and described by varied terminology and analogies
#History must be understood eschatologically, being brought along toward its ultimate goal when the kingdom of God, already present in Christ, is brought to its complete triumph
#In Christ, all of God's work of creation, revelation, and redemption is brought to fulfillment&lt;ref name=Stagg&gt;Stagg, Frank (1962). ''New Testament Theology''. Broadman. {{ISBN|0-8054-1613-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Classical Anglicanism===
For the [[Roman Catholic Church]], there are two modes of Revelation: Scripture and [[Apostolic Tradition|Tradition]]. Both of them are interpreted by the teachings of the Church. The Roman Catholic view is expressed clearly in the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] (1997):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
§ 82: As a result the Church, to whom the transmission and interpretation of Revelation is entrusted, does not derive her certainty about all revealed truths from the holy Scriptures alone. Both Scripture and Tradition must be accepted and honoured with equal sentiments of devotion and reverence.
&lt;br /&gt;
§ 107: The inspired books teach the truth. Since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm should be regarded as affirmed by the Holy Spirit, we must acknowledge that the books of Scripture firmly, faithfully, and without error teach that truth which God, for the sake of our salvation, wished to see confided to the Sacred Scriptures.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In Catholic terminology the teaching office is called the [[Magisterium]].  The Catholic view should not be confused with the two-source theory.  As the Catechism states in §§ 80 and 81, Revelation has "one common source ... two distinct modes of transmission."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/p1s1c2a2.htm "The Transmission of Divine Revelation"]. ''Catechism of the Catholic Church''. 2nd ed. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]] writers distinguish between Scripture and Tradition, Bishop Kallistos Ware says that for the Orthodox there is only one source of the Christian faith, Holy Tradition, within which Scripture exists.&lt;ref&gt;Ware, Kallistos (1993). [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q2Z8bVDVMLEC&amp;pg=PT243 "Holy Tradition: The Source of the Orthodox Faith"].''The Orthodox Church''. Penguin UK.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional [[Anglican Communion|Anglicans]] believe that "Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation", (Article VI), but also that the Catholic Creeds "ought thoroughly to be received and believed" (Article VIII), and that the Church "hath authority in Controversies of Faith" and is "a witness and keeper of Holy Writ" (Article XX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anglicansonline.org/basics/thirty-nine_articles.html |title=Articles of Religion |publisher=Anglicans Online |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical Anglicanism, therefore, like Orthodoxy, holds that Holy Tradition is the only safe guardian against perversion and innovation in the interpretation of Scripture.

In the famous words of Thomas Ken, Bishop of Bath and Wells: "As for my religion, I dye in the holy catholic and apostolic faith professed by the whole Church before the disunion of East and West, more particularly in the communion of the Church of England, as it stands distinguished from all Papal and Puritan innovations, and as it adheres to the doctrine of the Cross."

===Protestantism===
Following the doctrine of [[sola scriptura]], Protestants believe that their traditions of faith, practice and interpretations carry forward what the scriptures teach, and so tradition is not a source of authority in itself. Their traditions derive authority from the Bible, and are therefore always open to reëvaluation. This openness to doctrinal revision has extended in [[Liberal Christianity|Liberal]] Protestant traditions even to the reevaluation of the doctrine of Scripture upon which the Reformation was founded, and members of these traditions may even question whether the Bible is infallible in doctrine, inerrant in historical and other factual statements, and whether it has uniquely divine authority. However, the adjustments made by modern [[Protestantism|Protestants]] to their doctrine of scripture vary widely.

====American evangelical and fundamentalist Protestantism====
Within the US, the [[Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy]] (1978) is a statement, articulating evangelical views on this issue. Paragraph four of its summary states: "Being wholly and verbally God-given, Scripture is without error or fault in all its teaching, no less in what it states about God's acts in creation, about the events of world history, and about its own literary origins under God, than in its witness to God's saving grace in individual lives."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/index.html?mainframe=http://www.reformed.org/documents/icbi.html |title=The Chicago Statement of Biblical Inerrancy |publisher=Center for Reformed Theology and Apologetics |accessdate=19 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American mainline and liberal Protestantism====
[[Mainline (Protestant)|Mainline]] American [[Protestant]] denominations, including the [[United Methodist Church]], [[Presbyterian Church USA]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|The Episcopal Church]], and [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], do not teach the doctrine of inerrancy as set forth in the Chicago Statement. All of these churches have more ancient doctrinal statements asserting the authority of scripture, but may interpret these statements in such a way as to allow for a very broad range of teaching—from evangelicalism to skepticism. It is not an impediment to ordination in these denominations to teach that the scriptures contain errors, or that the authors follow a more or less unenlightened ethics that, however appropriate it may have seemed in the authors' time, moderns would be very wrong to follow blindly.

For example, [[ordination of women]] is universally accepted in the mainline churches, [[abortion]] is condemned as a grievous social tragedy but not always a personal [[sin]] or a crime against an unborn person, and [[homosexuality]] is sometimes recognized as a genetic propensity or morally neutral preference that should be neither encouraged nor condemned. In North America, the most contentious of these issues among these churches at the present time is how far the ordination of gay men and lesbians should be accepted.

Officials of the Presbyterian Church USA report: "We acknowledge the role of scriptural authority in the Presbyterian Church, but Presbyterians generally do not believe in biblical inerrancy. Presbyterians do not insist that every detail of chronology or sequence or prescientific description in scripture be true in literal form. Our confessions do teach biblical infallibility. Infallibility affirms the entire truthfulness of scripture without depending on every exact detail."&lt;ref&gt;"Homosexual ordination vote widens gap between Presbyterian factions". ''ReligionToday''. 20 June 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who hold a more liberal view of the Bible as a human witness to the glory of God, the work of fallible humans who wrote from a limited experience unusual only for the insight they have gained through their inspired struggle to know God in the midst of a troubled world. Therefore, they tend not to accept such doctrines as inerrancy. These churches also tend to retain the social activism of their evangelical forebears of the 19th century, placing particular emphasis on those teachings of scripture that teach compassion for the poor and concern for [[social justice]].

The message of personal [[salvation]] is, generally speaking, of the good that comes to oneself and the world through following the New Testament's [[ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] admonition to love others without hypocrisy or prejudice. Toward these ends, the "spirit" of the New Testament, more than the letter, is infallible and authoritative.

There are some movements that believe the Bible contains the teachings of Jesus but who reject the churches that were formed following its publication. These people believe all individuals can communicate directly with God and therefore do not need guidance or doctrines from a church. These people are known as [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchists]].

===Messianic Judaism===
[[Messianic Judaism]] generally holds the same view of New Testament authority as evangelical Protestants.&lt;ref name = "Beit Simcha"&gt;{{cite web

===Jehovah's Witnesses===
[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] accept the New Testament as divinely inspired Scripture, and as infallible in every detail, with equal authority as the Hebrew Scriptures. They view it as the written revelation and good news of the [[Messiah]], the [[Atonement in Christianity|ransom sacrifice of Jesus]], and the [[Kingdom of God]], explaining and expounding the Hebrew Bible, not replacing but vitally supplementing it. They also view the New Testament as the primary instruction guide for Christian living, and [[church discipline]]. They generally call the New Testament the "Christian Greek Scriptures", and see only the "covenants" as "old" or "new", but not any part of the actual Scriptures themselves.&lt;ref&gt;"Equipped For Every Good Work".

[[Oneness Pentecostalism]] subscribes to the common Protestant doctrine of ''[[sola scriptura]]''. They view the Bible as the inspired Word of God, and as absolutely [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]] in its contents (though not necessarily in every translation).&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web |last=Raddatz |first=Tom |url=http://www.1lord1faith.org/wm/Oneness/1TrinDebate.htm |title=A Response to the Oneness-Trinity Debate |publisher=1Lord1Faith.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050320000616/http://www.1lord1faith.org/wm/Oneness/1TrinDebate.htm |archivedate=20 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dulle, Jason. [http://www.onenesspentecostal.com/howgetbible.htm "How We Get Our Bible"]. Institute for Biblical Studies. Retrieved 15 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  They regard the New Testament as perfect and inerrant in every way, revealing the Lord Jesus Christ in the Flesh, and his Atonement, and which also explains and illuminates the Old Testament perfectly, and is part of the Bible canon, not because church councils or decrees claimed it so, but by witness of the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Dulle, Jason.

===Seventh-Day Adventists===
The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] holds the New Testament as the inspired Word of God, with God influencing the "thoughts" of the Apostles in the writing, not necessarily every word though.  The first fundamental belief of the Seventh-Day Adventist church stated that "The Holy Scriptures are the [[Biblical infallibility|infallible]] revelation of [God's] will." [[Seventh-day Adventist theology|Adventist theologians]] generally reject the "verbal inspiration" position on Scripture held by many conservative [[evangelical Christians]]. They believe instead that God inspired the thoughts of the biblical authors and apostles, and that the writers then expressed these thoughts in their own words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seventh-day Adventists Believe|author=Ministerial Association, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists |year=2005 |publisher=Pacific Press Publishing Association |edition=2nd |pages=14–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view is popularly known as "thought inspiration", and most Adventist members hold to that view. According to Ed Christian, former ''[[Journal of the Adventist Theological Society|JATS]]'' editor, "few if any [[Adventist Theological Society|ATS]] members believe in verbal inerrancy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McLarty |first=John |url=http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2001/11/adventist-theological-society-0 |title=The Adventist Theological Society |work=Adventist Today |date=15 November 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225063148/http://www.atoday.com/magazine/2001/11/adventist-theological-society-0 |archivedate=25 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the teachings of the New Testament compared to the Old, and the application in the New Covenant, Adventists have traditionally taught that the [[Ethical Decalogue|Decalogue]] is part of the moral law of God, which was not abrogated by the ministry and death of [[Jesus Christ]]. Therefore, the fourth commandment concerning the Sabbath is as applicable to Christian believers as the other nine. Adventists have often taught a distinction between "moral law" and "ceremonial law". According to Adventist beliefs, the moral law continues into the "New Testament era", but the ceremonial law was done away with by Jesus.

How the [[Mosaic law]] should be applied came up at Adventist conferences in the past, and Adventist theologians such as [[A. T. Jones]] and [[E. J. Waggoner]] looked at the problem addressed by Paul in [[Epistle to the Galatians|Galatians]] as not the ceremonial law, but rather the wrong use of the law ([[legalism (theology)|legalism]]). They were opposed by [[Uriah Smith]] and [[George Ide Butler|George Butler]] at the 1888 Conference. Smith in particular thought the Galatians issue had been settled by Ellen White already, yet in 1890 she claimed justification by faith is "the [[Three Angels' Messages|third angel's message]] in verity."{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Ellen White interpreted {{bibleverse||Colossians|2:14|NIV}} as saying that the ceremonial law was nailed to the cross.&lt;ref&gt;White, Ellen (2015). [https://books.google.com/books?id=yKqXCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT409 ''Patriarchs and Prophets'']. Start Publishing LLC. p. 365.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latter-day Saints===
Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) believe that the New Testament, as part of the [[Christian biblical canons|Christian biblical canon]], is accurate "as far as it is translated correctly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mormon.org/articles-of-faith |title=Articles of Faith |publisher=The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints |accessdate=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They believe the Bible as originally revealed is the word of God, but that the processes of transcription and translation have introduced errors into the texts as currently available, and therefore they cannot be regarded as completely inerrant.&lt;ref name="Givens2015"&gt;{{cite book|first=Terry L.|last=Givens|title=The Oxford Handbook of Mormonism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7c0fCgAAQBAJ|year=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-977836-2|pages=124–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LDSInerrancy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/topics/bible-inerrancy-of?lang=eng|title=Bible, Inerrancy of|date=2016|publisher=The Church of the Latter Day Saints|accessdate=23 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Old and New Testaments, the [[Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ|Book of Mormon]], the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] and the [[Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism)|Pearl of Great Price]] are considered part of their scriptural canon.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Mormonism, Macmillan 1992, pp. 106–107&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PaulsenMusser2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Lamont Paulsen|author2=Donald W.

==In the liturgy==
[[File:Codex Harcleianus.PNG|thumb|right|A Byzantine lectionary, ''[[Lectionary 150|Codex Harleianus]]'' (''l''&lt;sup&gt;150&lt;/sup&gt;), 995 AD, text of John 1:18.]] Despite the wide variety among [[Christian liturgy|Christian liturgies]], texts from the New Testament play a role in almost all forms of [[Christian worship]]. In addition to some language derived from the New Testament in the [[liturgy]] itself (e.g., the [[Trisagion]] may be based on Apocalypse 4:8, and the beginning of the "Hymn of Praise" draws upon Luke 2:14), the reading of extended passages from the New Testament is a practice common to almost all [[Christian worship]], liturgical or not.

These [[Lection|readings]] are most often part of an established [[lectionary]] (i.e., [[Lection|selected texts]] to be read at church services on specific days), and (together with an Old Testament reading and a [[Psalms (Christian)|Psalm]]) include a non-gospel reading from the New Testament and culminate with a [[Gospel (liturgy)|Gospel reading]]. No readings from the [[Book of Revelation]], however, are included in the standard [[lectionary]] of the [[Orthodox church|Eastern Orthodox churches]].

Central to the [[Christian liturgy]] is the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] or "Holy Communion". The [[Words of Institution]] that begin this rite are drawn directly from 1 Corinthians 11:23–26. In addition, the communal recitation of the [[Lord's Prayer]] (in the form found in the Gospel of Matthew 6:9–13) is also a standard feature of [[Christian worship]].

==In the arts==

The [[Early Christian art|earliest Christian art]] would often depict scenes from the New Testament such as the [[raising of Lazarus]], the [[baptism of Jesus]] or the motif of the [[Good Shepherd]].

[[Biblical paraphrase]]s and poetic renditions of stories from the life of Christ (e.g., the [[Heliand]]) became popular in the [[Middle Ages]], as did the portrayal of the [[Arrest of Jesus|arrest]], [[Trial of Jesus|trial]] and [[Crucifixion of Jesus|execution]] of Jesus in [[Passion play]]s. Indeed, the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] became a central theme in Christian [[Crucifixion in the arts|art]] and [[Passion (music)|music]]. The [[:Category:Portrayals of Jesus in film|ministry]] and [[Passion (Christianity)#Film|Passion]] of Jesus, as portrayed in one or more of the [[:Category:Films based on the Gospels|New Testament Gospels]], has also been a theme in film, almost since the inception of the medium (e.g., "La Passion", France, 1903).

A '''normal school''' is the historical term for an institution created to train high school graduates to be teachers by educating them in the norms of [[pedagogy]] and [[curriculum]]. Most such schools, where they still exist, are now denominated "teacher-training colleges" or "teachers' colleges" and may be organized as part of a comprehensive university. According to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', normal schools in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] trained teachers for [[Primary education|primary schools]], while in continental [[Europe]], the equivalent colleges educated teachers for primary, [[Secondary education|secondary]] and [[Tertiary education|tertiary]] schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oed.com/ |title=Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1685, [[Jean-Baptiste de La Salle|St. Jean-Baptiste de La Salle]], founder of the [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]], founded what is generally considered the first normal school, the ''École Normale'', in [[Reims]], [[Champagne]], [[France]]. The term "normal" herein refers to the goal of these institutions to instill and reinforce particular ''norms'' within students. "Norms" included historical behavioral norms of the time, as well as norms that reinforced targeted societal values, ideologies and dominant narratives in the form of curriculum.

Educating teachers was of great importance in the newly industrialized European economies and their need for a reliable, reproducible and uniform work force. The process of instating such norms within students depended upon the creation of the first uniform, formalized national educational curriculum. Thus, normal schools, as the teacher training schools, were tasked with both developing this new curriculum and developing the techniques through which teachers would instill these ideas, behaviors and values in the minds of their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=H.A.|date=|title=The Normal-School Curriculum|url=|journal=The Elementary School Journal|volume=20|pages=276–284}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public normal school in the United States was founded in [[Concord, Vermont]], by [[Samuel Read Hall]] in 1823 to train teachers. In 1839, another normal school was established in the Commonwealth of [[Massachusetts]]; it evolved into [[Framingham State University]]. The first modern teacher training school in China was established by Qing educator [[Sheng Xuanhuai|Sheng Xuanghuai]] in 1895 as the normal school of the Nanyang Public School (now [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]) in [[Shanghai]], [[China]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uta.fi/cerec/educationandresearch/ChinaEduLecture/Teacher%20Education%20in%20China.pdf|title=Teacher Education in China :

Many comprehensive [[Public university|public or state-supported universities]], such as the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in the United States and [[Beijing Normal University]] in China, were established and operated as normal schools before expanding their faculties and organizing as research universities. Some of these universities, particularly in Asia, retain the word "Normal" in their name to recognize their historical purpose. In Canada, most normal schools were eventually assimilated into a university as its faculty of education, offering a one or two-year [[Bachelor of Education]] degree. Such a degree requires at least three, but usually four, years of prior undergraduate study.

==Etymology==

The term "normal school" originated in the early 16th century from the French ''école normale''.&lt;ref name="Edwards1991"&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Theory, History, and Practice of Education: Fin de siècle and a new beginning |journal=McGill Journal of Education |volume=26 |issue=3 |date=Fall 1991 |url=http://mje.mcgill.ca/index.php/MJE/article/viewFile/7991/5919 |author=Reginald Edwards}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French concept of an "école normale" was to provide a model school with model classrooms to teach model teaching practices to its student teachers. The children being taught, their teachers, and the teachers of the teachers were often together in the same building.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} Although a [[laboratory school]], it was the official school for the children—primary or secondary.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

== History and modern teacher education ==

=== Europe ===

===== Finland =====
In Finland, normal schools are under national university administration, whereas most schools are administered by the local [[Municipalities of Finland|municipality]]. Teacher aspirants do most of their compulsory trainee period in normal schools and teach while being supervised by a senior teacher.

===== France =====
In France, a two-tier system developed since the [[French Revolution|Revolution]]: primary school teachers were educated at [[département]]al ''écoles normales'', high school teachers at the [[École normale supérieure|Écoles normales supérieures]]. Nowadays all teachers are educated in {{illm|École supérieure du professorat et de l'éducation|fr}} (Graduate School of Teaching and Education). The [[Écoles Normales Supérieures]] in France and the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] in Italy no longer specialize in teacher training.

===== United Kingdom =====
In the United Kingdom, teacher training colleges were once separate institutions, and many such colleges adopted the title "College of Higher Education".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=file:///C:/Users/Owner/Downloads/Memories_of_Caerleon_-_final.pdf|title=Memories of Caerleon|publisher=[[University of South Wales]]|access-date=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A restructuring of higher education in the UK during the 1980s resulted in many of these adopting the status of "university". The [[University of Chester]] traces its roots back to 1839 as the earliest training college in the United Kingdom. Others were established by religious institutions and were single-sex until [[World War II]]. Since then, they have either become multi-discipline universities in their own right (e.g. University of Chester, [[St Mary's University, Twickenham]], [[Edge Hill University]]) or merged with another university to become its faculty of education (e.g. [[Moray House]]).

In [[Wales]], there were two colleges which included the word 'Normal' in their name: the first being 'The Normal College, Swansea' where the eminent mathematician [[John Viriamu Jones]] was educated and the second was [[Bangor Normal College|The Normal College, Bangor]] (founded 1858), which survived until 1996, when it became part of [[University of Wales Bangor]]. The latter was one of the last institutions in the UK to retain the word "Normal" in its name.

===== Lithuania =====
In Lithuania, [[Lithuanian University of Educational Sciences]] (LEU), former Vilnius Pedagogical University (VPU) is the main teachers' training institution, established in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leu.lt|title=Pradžia - Lietuvos edukologijos universitetas|first=Fresh|last=Media|date=|website=www.leu.lt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mainland China ====
In [[Mainland China]], the "normal school" terminology is still preserved in the official English names of former normal schools established in the late 19th and early 20th century, with [[Beijing Normal University]] being the oldest such school to have kept the term. The Chinese term ''normal university'' ({{zh|c=师范大学|p=shīfàn dàxué}}, abbreviated 师大; ''shīdà'') refers to a modern comprehensive university established as a normal school in the early twentieth century. These "normal universities" are usually controlled by the national or provincial government. In 1895, Qing banking tycoon and educator [[Sheng Xuanhuai|Sheng Xuanghuai]] gained approval from the [[Guangxu Emperor]] to establish the Nanyang Public School in Shanghai, China.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This comprehensive institution included the first normal school on the Chinese mainland. Since 1949, many former normal schools in China have developed into comprehensive research universities. As of 2012, [[East China Normal University]] and [[Beijing Normal University]], both members of the national government's [[Project 985]] program to build world-class universities, have been ranked the top two among the mainland Chinese universities that originated as normal schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/top10/2011-12/08/content_24105530_9.htm|title=Top 10 normal universities (teachers' colleges) in China - China.org.cn|first=|last=徐林|date=|website=www.china.org.cn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Taiwan ====
In [[Taiwan]], three universities served as national normal universities historically. Located in [[National Taiwan Normal University|Taipei]], [[National Changhua University of Education|Changhua]], and [[National Kaohsiung Normal University|Kaohsiung]], the schools prepared [[secondary school]] teachers; these schools' missions have expanded since to make them ''de facto'' [[liberal arts]] universities. Ten Taiwanese teachers' colleges ({{zh|c=師範學院|p=shīfàn xuéyuàn}}, abbreviated 師院; shīyuàn, "normal colleges") originated as normal schools [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|established by the Japanese]]. After the [[Retrocession Day|end of World War 2]] these were reorganized as provincial normal schools by the Kuomintang and then as provincial teachers' colleges. With the arrival of pluralistic [[democracy]] in the early 1990s these colleges came under national control, and by the mid-2000s (decade) all had been renamed as "universities of education" (教育大學) or simply "universities" to signify their more comprehensive missions.

==== Philippines ====

Asbury|title=The Salem Normal School: Past, Present, and Future|journal=The Elementary School Journal|date=February 1930|volume= 30|issue=6|page=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] was selected due to many factors including the city's historical and commercial significance and need for local teacher education.

Prior to the founding of the normal school, Salem women had few opportunities to receive teacher training and the Salem school system was replete with funding, attendance, and teacher compensation problems. It was assumed that by training women as teachers, they could be hired at a lower salary than male teachers, thus alleviating the city's public school budget and teacher compensation challenges.

The original location was at the corner of Broad and Summer Streets, with the building's dedication held on September 14, 1854. Richard Edwards, a graduate of Bridgewater Normal School (now [[Bridgewater State University]]), was the first president of Salem Normal School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Maloney|first=Joan|title=Salem Normal School 1854-1905: A Tradition of Excellence|year=1990|publisher=Tapestry Press|location=Acton, MA|isbn=0-924234-31-8|pages=1–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stratford Normal School was founded at 270 Water Street in 1908 in [[Stratford, Ontario]].  Its emphasis was primarily for training teachers for rural conditions. Its name was changed to Stratford Teachers' College in 1953 and closed its doors in 1973 having trained close to 14,000 teachers.  The site was maintained, and was home to the Stratford Perth Museum for a number of years, being renamed the Discovery Centre.  The museum moved to another location, however, and the building is now leased by the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, and has been named once again the Normal School Building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/2013/03/14/city-council-being-asked-to-change-discovery-centre-name|title=Return to Normal School name in works|first=|last=nurun.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prince Edward Island====
The Prince Edward Island Normal School has its origin in 1856 on the grounds of [[Prince of Wales College]] in Charlottetown, P.E.I.

====Saskatchewan====
The Saskatchewan Normal School, also once known as the Regina Normal School, was founded as early as 1890 in Regina moving into its first permanent structure in January, 1914.  In 1964 it was transferred to [[University of Saskatchewan]] Regina Campus and in 1974 becoming part of the [[University of Regina]].  Another normal school was founded in the early 1920s in Moose Jaw and was later transferred into the Regina campus in 1959.

The [[Saskatoon Normal School]] in [[Saskatoon]] was founded in 1912 and served until 1953. It has now been integrated with the Faculty of Education at [[University of Saskatchewan]].

===Latin America===
Early normal schools in [[Latin America]] include several in Mexico, such as the ''Escuela Normal de Enseñanza Mutua de Oaxaca'' (1824), the ''Escuela Normal Mixta de San Luis Potosí'' (1849), the Normal de Guadalajara (1881), and the ''Escuela Normal para Profesores de Instrucción Primaria'' (1887). The Mexican normal school system was nationalized and reorganized by the ''[[Secretariat of Public Education|Secretaría de Educación Pública]]'' (Secretariat of Public Education) under [[José Vasconcelos]] in 1921.

Perhaps the oldest continually operating normal school in Latin America is the Escuela Normal Superior José Abelardo Núñez, founded in [[Santiago, Chile]], in 1842 as the Escuela de Preceptores de Santiago under the direction of the emininent [[Argentina|Argentine]] educator, writer, and politician [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]. The first normal school in the [[Dominican Republic]] was founded in 1875 by [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] educator and activist [[Eugenio María de Hostos]].

In Argentina, normal schools were founded starting in 1852, and still exist today and carry that name. Teachers' training is considered higher education and requires a high school diploma, but normal schools have the particularity of granting five year teacher degrees for primary school or four year degrees for kindergarten, while at the same time hosting secondary, primary school students, and kindergarten and pre-school. Teachers-to-be do intense practical training in the schools annexed to the higher education section. This is the main difference with other teachers' training institutions called Instituto de Formación Docente and with universities that grant teaching degrees.

Other Latin American nations have long traditions of normal schools. In Panama, the Escuela Normal Juan Demóstenes Arosemena was founded in [[Santiago de Veraguas]], [[Panama]] in 1938. In [[Colombia]], normal schools were primarily associated with women's religious schools although in modern times have admitted men, thus forming ''escuelas normales mixtas'' (mixed normal schools). In [[Paraguay]], they are known as Instituto de Formación Docente.

An '''oceanarium''' can be either a [[marine mammal park]], such as [[MarineLand]], or a large-scale [[Public aquarium|aquarium]], such as the [[Lisbon Oceanarium]], presenting an [[ocean]] habitat with [[marine (ocean)|marine]] animals, especially large ocean dwellers such as [[shark]]s.

== First marine mammal parks==
{{Main article|Marine mammal park}}
[[Marineland of Florida]], one of the first [[theme park]]s in [[Florida]], United States, started in 1938, claims to be "the world's first oceanarium"

Marineland of Florida was developed as ''Marine Studios'' near [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] in [[Marineland, Florida]], which was followed in [[Florida]] by [[Miami Seaquarium]], opened in 1955 and in [[California]] by [[Marineland of the Pacific]], opened in 1954 near [[Los Angeles]], and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom|Marine World, Africa USA]], opened in 1968 near [[San Francisco]].

==SeaWorld==
{{Main article|SeaWorld}}

[[SeaWorld San Diego]] was opened in 1964, developed by four fraternity brothers Milt Shedd, Ken Norris, David DeMott and George Millay.
[[SeaWorld]] Aurora opened in 1970 near [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].
[[SeaWorld Orlando]] was opened in 1973.
SeaWorld (San Diego, Aurora, Orlando) was sold to [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt Brace Jovanovich]] (a publishing company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]]) in 1976. 
They purchased Marineland of the Pacific in 1986 and closed the [[park]].
They had opened [[SeaWorld San Antonio]] in 1988.
In 1989 they sold SeaWorld (San Diego, Aurora, Orlando, San Antonio) to [[Anheuser-Busch]], the world's largest brewer and owner of the [[Busch Gardens]] Safari Parks, for US$1.1 billion. 
In 2001, Anheuser-Busch sold the [[Ohio]] [[park]] which finally ceased its activities in 2004.

== World's largest marine life park ==
[[File:Shedd belugas 2017-09-02.jpg|thumb|[[Beluga whale|Belugas]] swimming in the Abbott Oceanarium at the [[Shedd Aquarium]]. The lower level of the Oceanarium allows underwater viewing of the beluga whales and the dolphins.]]
When the 170,000-square-foot Oceanarium at the [[Shedd Aquarium]] in [[Chicago]] opened on April 27, 1991, it debuted as the largest indoor marine mammal facility in the world. The position as world's oceanarium has since shifted repeatedly in recent years. From 2005 to 2012 it was the [[Georgia Aquarium]] in the United States with an initial total water volume of {{convert|8500000|USgal|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, later it expanded to {{convert|10000000|USgal|m3|disp=flip|abbr=on}}, and home to 100–120,000 animals of 700 species. In 2012 it was surpassed by [[Marine Life Park]] in [[Singapore]] with a total water volume of {{convert|45000|m3|USgal|abbr=on}} and over 100,000 [[animals]] of more than 800 species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.cnn.com/singapore/play/singapore-open-worlds-largest-oceanarium-610811|title=World's largest oceanarium opens|work=CNNGo Staff|publisher=CNN|date=2012-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the Singapore park was surpassed by the [[Chimelong Ocean Kingdom]] in China, the current record holder, with a total water volume of {{convert|48750|m3|USgal|-4|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=guinnessworldrecords&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/3/chinas-hengqin-ocean-kingdom-confirmed-as-worlds-largest-aquarium-as-attraction-sets-five-world-records-56471/|title = China’s Hengqin Ocean Kingdom confirmed as world’s largest aquarium as attraction sets five world records |publisher = Guinness World Records|date = 31 March 2014|accessdate = 9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Marine public aquariums ==
[[File:Afrykarium tunel.jpg|thumb| The largest tank of the [[Africarium|Afrykarium]] in [[Wrocław]] shows the depths of the [[Mozambique Channel]], where sharks, rays, and other large [[pelagic fish]] can be viewed from this 18 meter long underwater [[acrylic tunnel]].]]
Modern marine aquariums try to create natural environments. A host of marine animals swim together in the four-story cylindrical tank of the [[New England Aquarium]] in [[Boston]], which opened in 1969.
At the [[National Aquarium in Baltimore]], which opened in 1981, a walkway spirals up through the center of two gigantic cylindrical tanks, the Atlantic Coral Reef and the Shark Alley, which display sharks, sawfish, and other sea creatures.
Since then, many new aquariums have sought even greater realism, often concentrating on local environments. The richly endowed [[Monterey Bay Aquarium]] in California, which opened in 1984, is an outstanding example.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Leighton R., ''Aquariums: Windows to Nature'', Prentice Hall General Reference, New York, 1993. {{ISBN|0-671-85019-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Africarium|Afrykarium]] is the only themed oceanarium devoted solely to exhibiting the [[fauna of Africa]] and located in [[Wrocław, Poland]]. A part of the [[Wrocław Zoo]], the idea behind the Afrykarium is to comprehensively present selected ecosystems from the continent of [[Africa]]. Housing over 10 thousand animals, its breadth extends from housing insects such cockroaches to the large mammals like the elephants on an area of over 33 [[hectare]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Isler |first1=Danuta |title=A trip to Wroclaw Afrykarium |url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/6/Artykul/365527,A-trip-to-Wroclaw-Afrykarium |website=Radio Poland |publisher=Radio Poland}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Astana]], the  capital of [[Kazakhstan]] is home to the only Oceanarium in [[Central Asia]].

==Evidence of parasitism==

One of the most daunting tasks involved in studying parasitic relationships from the past is supporting the assertion that the relationship between two organisms is indeed parasitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Littlewood | first1 = D.T.J. | last2 = Donovan | first2 = S.K. | year = 2003 | title = Fossil parasites: A case of identity | journal = Geology Today | volume = 19 | issue = 4| pages = 136–142 | doi=10.1046/j.1365-2451.2003.00406.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Organisms living in "close association" with each other may exhibit one of several different types of [[Trophic dynamics|trophic]] relationships, such as [[parasitism]], [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], and [[commensalism]].  Demonstration of true parasitism between existing species typically involves observing the harmful effects of parasites on a presumed host.  Experimental infection of the presumed host, followed by recovery of [[:wikt:viable|viable]] parasites from that host also supports any claim of true parasitism.  Obviously such experiments are not possible with specimens of extinct organisms found in paleontological contexts.

Assumptions of true parasitism in paleontological settings which are based on analogy to known present-day parasitic relationships may not be valid, due to [[Host (biology)#Host range|host-specificity]].  For example, ''[[Trypanosoma brucei gambiense]]'' and ''[[Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense]]'' are both devastating human parasites, but the related subspecies ''[[Trypanosoma brucei brucei]]'' will infect a number of animal hosts, but cannot even survive in the human blood stream, much less reproduce and infect a human host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pays | first1 = E. | last2 = Vanhollebeke | first2 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Mutual self-defence: The trypanolytic factor story | journal = Microbes and Infection | volume = 10 | issue = 9| pages = 985–989 | doi=10.1016/j.micinf.2008.07.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So a related (or unidentifiable) species of ''Trypanosoma'' found in a paleontological or archaeological context may not be a true human parasite, even though it appears identical (or very similar) to the modern parasitic forms.

The most convincing evidence of paleoparasitism is obtained when a presumed parasite is found in direct association with its presumed host, in a context that is consistent with known host-parasite associations.  Some examples include [[helminth]]s caught in amber in the process of escaping from the body of an insect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poinar | first1 = G. | last2 = Jr | first2 =  | last3 = Buckley | first3 = R. | year = 2006 | title = Nematode (Nematoda: Mermithidae) and hairworm (Nematomorpha: Chordodidae) parasites in Early Cretaceous amber | journal = Journal of Invertebrate Pathology | volume = 93 | issue = 1| pages = 36–41 | doi=10.1016/j.jip.2006.04.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; lice found in the fur of guinea pig mummies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dittmar | first1 = K | year = 2000 | title = Evaluation of ectoparasites on the guinea pig mummies of El Yaral and Moquegua Valley, in southern Peru | url = http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0717-73562000000100020&amp;script=sci_arttext | journal = [[Chungara (journal)|Chungara&amp;nbsp;— Revista de Antropología Chilena]] | volume = 32 | issue = 1| pages = 123–125 | doi=10.4067/s0717-73562000000100020}}&lt;/ref&gt; protozoans in the alimentary canal of flies in amber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Poinar | first1 = G. | last2 = Jr | first2 =  | last3 = Telford Jr | first3 = S.R. | year = 2005 | title = ''Paleohaemoproteus burmacis'' gen.n., sp.n.

The presence of structures resembling leaf miner trails in leaf fossils provide indirect evidence of parasitism, even if remains of the parasite are not recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Labandeira | first1 = C.C. | last2 = Dilcher | first2 = D.L. | last3 = Davis | first3 = D.R. | last4 = Wagner | first4 = D.L. | year = 1994 | title = Ninety-seven million years of angiosperm-insect association: Paleobiological insights into the meaning of coevolution | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/91/25/12278.abstract | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 91 | issue = 25| pages = 12278–12282 | doi=10.1073/pnas.91.25.12278| pmc = 45420 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The dramatic tissue aberrations seen in present-day plant [[gall]]s and gall-like structures in some invertebrates are direct physiological reactions to the presence of either [[Morphology (biology)|metazoan]] parasites or [[microbial]] [[pathogens]].

Host-parasite interactions today are often exploited by other species, and similar examples have been found in the fossil record of plant galls and leaf mines.  For example, there are species of wasps, called [[inquilines]], which are unable to induce their own plant galls, so they simply take up residence in the galls that are made by other wasps.&lt;ref name="journals.royalsociety" /&gt; Another example is the [[predation]] of plant galls or leaf mines, to eat the trapped insect larva inside the gall or mine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Krassilov | first1 = V | year = 2008 | title = Mine and gall predation as top-down regulation in the plant-insect systems from the Cretaceous of Negev, Israel | journal = Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology | volume = 261 | issue = 3–4| pages = 261–269 | doi=10.1016/j.palaeo.2008.01.017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Parmenides]] Foundation was founded by [[Albrecht von Müller]] in 2000 to support interdisciplinary research on thinking.
The foundation has an international faculty of more than 30 researchers from the fields of [[neurosciences]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroinformatics]], [[cognitive psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[evolutionary anthropology]].
Part of the research faculty focusses on two areas: developing an integrative conceptual framework and testing respective hypotheses via various imaging techniques (especially [[fMRI]], [[EEG]] and [[near infrared spectroscopy|NIRS]]) as well as in complementary behavioural studies.

The foundation is a cooperative partner of the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]] and its researchers collaborate with the faculties of experimental and developmental psychology, philosophy, and medicine.

The foundation sells Parmenides EIDOS Suite, which is a derivative of the Think Tools Suite of the now defunct [[Think Tools AG]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3869">A '''practical engineer''' (Senior Technician)({{lang-he|הנדסאי}}) is a professional degree awarded by [[List of Israeli universities and colleges#Colleges|technological college]]s in [[Israel]] and validated by the National Institute for Technological Training of the [[Industry, Trade and Labor Ministry|Ministry of Industry, Trade &amp; Labor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moital.gov.il/NR/exeres/B0B48981-357D-446F-AFAC-91A358E93C87.htm Ministry of Industry, Trade &amp; Labor (State of Israel)] Retrieved on 15 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It is a unique qualification that combines theoretical study with practical training, and is currently available only in Israel. It normally takes up to 3 academic years to obtain a Practical Engineer's degree, depending on the taught discipline.

== Professional regulation ==
Practical Engineers are used to mediate between professional engineers and engineering technicians.  While most of the decision making process is performed by professional engineers and most of the practical work is done by technicians, practical engineers are taught to be able to follow instructions and re-adapt concepts designed by professional engineers.

In Israel, practical engineers are an integral part of the [[hi-tech]] industry and form an important work-force.

Practical Engineers are licensed to lead and hold responsible for engineering projects up to a certain level. For example, in Israel, architectural practical engineers are permitted to design constructions of up to four stories high with 2 dimensional static scheme and spans up to 6 meters, while for larger scale projects a full engineering degree is required.

== Education, training &amp; skills ==
Practical engineers receive formal education that meets with criteria published by the National Institute for Technological Training.
In sum over 2100 frontal academic hours are taught over a period of two to three years.

From an academic point of view, the main things differentiating engineers from practical engineers are the level and magnitude of foundation subjects, such as mathematics and physics.

Practical Engineers are taught foundations but only to the extent required by their profession, hence making their study shorter and more focused.

As part of the certification process, practical engineers are also required to undertake national certification tests, and to complete and defend a final project in their field of study or to participate in an [[internship]] program.

== Equivalent qualifications ==
There are some international qualifications equivalent to the Practical Engineer's degree. In Spain, the title of Ingeniero Técnico (Spanish for Technical Engineer) bears many similarities to its Israeli equivalent. Also, although not exactly the same, Practical Engineers are often thought of as [[Engineering Technician|Engineering technicians]], [[Associate degree|Associate Engineers]] or Jr. Engineers in some English speaking countries. The French [[Brevet de Technicien Supérieur]] is similar.

Although not an academic degree in its traditional sense, practical engineers are normally awarded some academic credit when pursuing further study at a [[Bachelor's degree]]

'''Professional development''' is learning to earn or maintain professional [[credentials]] such as [[academic degrees]] to formal coursework, attending conferences, and [[informal learning]] opportunities situated in practice. It has been described as intensive and collaborative, ideally incorporating an evaluative stage.&lt;ref&gt;Speck, M. &amp; Knipe, C. (2005) ''Why can't we get it right? Designing high-quality professional development for standards-based schools''(2nd ed.). Thousand Oaks: Corwin Press{{qn|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of approaches to professional development, including consultation, coaching, [[communities of practice]], lesson study, mentoring, reflective supervision and technical assistance.&lt;ref name="community.fpg.unc.edu"&gt;National Professional Development Center on Inclusion. (2008). [http://fpg.unc.edu/node/4611 "What do we mean by professional development in the early childhood field?"]. Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina, FPG Child Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The [[University of Management and Technology (United States)|University of Management and Technology]] notes the use of the phrase "professional development" from 1857 onwards.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In the training of school staff in the United States, "[t]he need for professional development [...] came to the forefront in the 1960s".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participants==
A wide variety of people, such as teachers, military officers and non-commissioned officers, health care professionals, lawyers, accountants and engineers engage in professional development. Individuals may participate in professional development because of an interest in lifelong learning, a sense of moral obligation, to maintain and improve professional competence, to enhance career progression, to keep abreast of new technology and practices, or to comply with professional regulatory requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Golding, L. &amp; Gray, I. (2006).''Continuing professional development for clinical psychologists:A practical handbook''. The British Psychological Society. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jasper, M. (2006).''Professional development, reflection, and decision-making''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Many American states have professional development requirements for school teachers. For example, Arkansas teachers must complete 60 hours of documented professional development activities annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Professional Development and Renewal of Standard Teaching License|url=http://www.arkansased.org/teachers/prof_dev_renewal.html|website=ArkansasEd.org|publisher=Arkansas Department of Education|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430155048/http://arkansased.org/teachers/prof_dev_renewal.html|archivedate=30 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional development credits are named differently from state to state. For example, teachers: in Indiana are required to earn 90 Continuing Renewal Units (CRUs) per year;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teacher-world.com/certification/indiana-renewal.html |title=Indiana Certification Renewal &amp;#124; Find Out How to Renew Indiana Teaching Certificates on |publisher=Teacher-world.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Massachusetts, teachers need 150 Professional Development Points (PDPs);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doe.mass.edu/recert/qa.html |title=Recertification Q and A - Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education |publisher=Doe.mass.edu |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Georgia, must earn 10 Professional Learning Units (PLUs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachersprofessionallearningunits.com/ga-certification-resources.php |title=Georgia Teacher Certification Information - Georgia PLU's Resources Online - GA Teaching License Resources |publisher=Teachersprofessionallearningunits.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216171116/http://teachersprofessionallearningunits.com/ga-certification-resources.php |archivedate=2013-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; American and Canadian nurses, as well as those in the United Kingdom, have to participate in formal and informal professional development (earning credit based on attendance of education that has been accredited by a regulatory agency) in order to maintain professional registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuing Competence|url=http://www.crnm.mb.ca/competence.php|website=College of Registered Nurses of Manitoba|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531032351/http://www.crnm.mb.ca/competence.php|archivedate=31 May 2008|date=April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Continuing Education|url=http://www.ndbon.org/education/continuing%20education/continuing%20education.shtml|website=North Dakota Board of Nursing|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207190359/http://www.ndbon.org/education/continuing%20education/continuing%20education.shtml|archivedate=7 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmc-uk.org/ |title=The Nursing and Midwifery Council &amp;#124; Nursing and Midwifery Council |publisher=Nmc-uk.org |date=2014-03-14 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional school==
A professional school is a graduate school level institution that prepares students for careers in specific fields. Some of the schools also offer undergraduate degrees in specific professions. Examples of this type of school include:
[[List of international architecture schools|Architecture school]], [[Business school]], [[Divinity school]], [[Engineering school]], [[Journalism school]], [[Law school]], [[Library school]], [[School of education|Education school]] ([[Normal school]]), [[Public policy school]] and [[Council on Social Work Education|Social work school]]. The field of healthcare has many professional schools including [[Medical school]], [[Chiropractic school]], [[Dental school]], [[Pharmacy school]], [[Physician Assistant|Physician Assistant school]], [[Physiotherapy|Physiotherapy school]], [[Podiatric medical school]], [[Public health#Schools of public health|Public health school]], [[Speech-Language Pathology]] School, [[Occupational therapy|Occupational therapy school]], [[Nursing school]], [[Veterinary school]] and [[List of optometry schools|Optometry school]].

==Approaches==
In a broad sense, professional development may include ''formal'' types of vocational education, typically post-secondary or poly-technical training leading to qualification or credential required to obtain or retain employment. Professional development may also come in the form of pre-service or in-service professional development programs. These programs may be formal, or informal, group or individualized. Individuals may pursue professional development independently, or programs may be offered by human resource departments. Professional development on the job may develop or enhance process skills, sometimes referred to as leadership skills, as well as task skills. Some examples for process skills are 'effectiveness skills', 'team functioning skills', and 'systems thinking skills'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Garet|first1=M. S.|last2=Porter|first2=A. C|last3=Desimone|first3=L.|last4=Birman|first4=B. F|last5=Yoon|first5=K. S.|title=What Makes Professional Development Effective? Results From a National Sample of Teachers|journal=American Educational Research Journal|date=1 January 2001|volume=38|issue=4|pages=915–945|doi=10.3102/00028312038004915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Connecting Coaches to Corporates|url=https://twofold.asia/|website=twofold.asia|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional development opportunities can range from a single workshop to a semester-long academic course, to services offered by a medley of different professional development providers and varying widely with respect to the philosophy, content, and format of the learning experiences.  Some examples of approaches to professional development include:&lt;ref name="community.fpg.unc.edu"/&gt;

*'''Case Study Method''' – The case method is a teaching approach that consists in presenting the students with a case, putting them in the role of a decision maker facing a problem {{Harv|Hammond|1976}} – See [[Case method]].
*'''Consultation''' – to assist an individual or group of individuals to clarify and address immediate concerns by following a systematic problem-solving process.
*'''Coaching''' – to enhance a person’s competencies in a specific skill area by providing a process of observation, reflection, and action.
*'''Communities of Practice''' – to improve professional practice by engaging in shared inquiry and learning with people who have a common goal
*'''Lesson Study''' – to solve practical dilemmas related to intervention or instruction through participation with other professionals in systematically examining practice
*'''Mentoring''' – to promote an individual's  awareness and refinement of his or her own professional development by providing and recommending structured opportunities for reflection and observation
*'''Reflective Supervision''' – to support, develop, and ultimately evaluate the performance of employees through a process of inquiry that encourages their understanding and articulation of the rationale for their own practices
*'''Technical Assistance''' – to assist individuals and their organization to improve by offering resources and information, supporting networking and change efforts.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

The [[World Bank]]'s 2019 [[World Development Report]] on the future of work &lt;ref&gt;[http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/816281518818814423/pdf/2019-WDR-Report.pdf World Bank World Development Report 2019: The Changing Nature of Work.]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that professional development opportunities for those both in and out of work, such as flexible learning opportunities at universities and adult learning programs, enable labor markets to adjust to the future of work.

==Initial==
Initial professional development (IPD) is defined as "a period of development during which an individual acquires a level of [[Skill|competence]] necessary in order to operate as an autonomous professional".&lt;ref&gt;The UK Initial Professional Development (IPD) Forum http://www.littlerichley.eclipse.co.uk/ukipdforum/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Professional associations]] may recognise the successful completion of IPD by the award of [[chartered (professional)|chartered]] or similar status. Examples of professional bodies that require IPD prior to the award of professional status are the [[Institute of Mathematics and its Applications]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ima.org.uk/activities/professional/initial_professional_development_ipd.cfm.html |title=Initial Professional Development (IPD) |publisher=The Institute of Mathematics and its Applications |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Institution of Structural Engineers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istructe.org/careers-and-development/professional-development/initial-professional-development |title=Initial Professional Development |publisher=The Institution of Structural Engineers |accessdate=8 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About-membership/Professional-development/About-IPD.aspx |title=Membership: About membership: Professional development: About IPD |publisher=[[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health|(IOSH)]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing==
Continuing professional development (CPD) or continuing professional education (CPE) is [[continuing education]] to maintain knowledge and skills. Most [[profession]]s have CPD obligations. Examples are the [[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/uk/about-rics/what-we-do/continuing-professional-development/ |title=About RCIS: What we do: Continuing professional development (CPD) |publisher=[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American Academy of Financial Management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialanalyst.org/ce.html|title=GAFM ®  Certified Financial Analyst Certification  Risk Certified Financial Planner Books GAFM ® -  AFA Accredited Financial Analyst ® Certification - AMA Accredited Management Accountant  ® - MMC Master Management Consultant ® Chartered Economist - Continuing Ed|website=www.financialanalyst.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; safety professionals with the [[International Institute of Risk &amp; Safety Management]] (IIRSM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iirsm.org/become_a_member/membership_levels |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927010130/http://www.iirsm.org/become_a_member/membership_levels |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health]] (IOSH),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iosh.co.uk/Membership/About-membership/Professional-development/About-CPD.aspx |title=Membership: About membership: Professional development: About CPD |publisher=[[Institution of Occupational Safety and Health|(IOSH)]] |accessdate=9 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and medical and legal professionals, who are subject to [[continuing medical education]] or [[continuing legal education]] requirements, which vary by jurisdiction.

'''''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism''''' was an exhibition curated by [[R. Siva Kumar]] at the [[National Gallery of Modern Art]] in 1997, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of India's Independence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/48720&lt;/ref&gt;

The exhibition, through bringing about a hundred works each of four modern Indian artists, namely [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] on the centre stage, put the Santiniketan art movement into focus.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.frontline.in/static/html/fl1418/14180690.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumar argues that the "Santiniketan artists did not believe that to be indigenous one has to be historicist either in theme or in style, and similarly to be modern one has to adopt a particular trans-national formal language or technique. Modernism was to them neither a style nor a form of internationalism. It was critical re-engagement with the foundational aspects of art necessitated by changes in one’s unique historical position".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextual modernism==
The year 1997 bore witness to two parallel gestures of canon formation. On the one hand, the Baroda Group, a coalition whose original members included [[Vivan Sundaram]], [[Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh]], [[Bhupen Khakhar]], and [[Nalini Malani]]—and which had left its mark on history in the form of the 1981 exhibition "Place for People"—was definitively historicized in 1997 with the publication of Contemporary Art in Baroda, an anthology of essays edited by Sheikh. On the other hand, the art historian Kumar’s exhibition and related publication, ''A Contextual Modernism'', focused on the [[Santiniketan]] artists [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]], and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. Of the Santiniketan artists, Kumar observed that they "reviewed traditional antecedents in relation to the new avenues opened up by cross-cultural contacts. They also saw it as a historical imperative. Cultural insularity, they realized, had to give way to eclecticism and cultural impurity."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyu.edu/greyart/publications/AbbyGreyAndIndianModernism_GreyNYU_20150116.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kumar "The Santiniketan artists were one of the first who consciously challenged this idea of modernism by opting out of both internationalist modernism and historicist indigenousness and tried to create a context sensitive modernism."&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary critic [[Ranjit Hoskote]] while reviewing the works of contemporary artist [[Atul Dodiya]] writes, "The exposure to Santinketan, through a literary detour, opened Dodiya’s eyes to the historical circumstances of what Kumar has called a “contextual modernism” developed in eastern India in the 1930s and ’40s during the turbulent decades of the global Depression, the Gandhian liberation struggle, the Tagorean cultural renaissance and World War II."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tehelka.com/creator-of-a-floating-world/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contextual modernism and the Bengal School of Art==
{{Culture of Bengal}}
Kumar had been studying the work of the Santiniketan masters and thinking about their approach to art since the early 1980s. The practice of subsuming [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ram Kinker Baij]] and [[Benode Behari Mukherjee]] under the [[Bengal School of Art]] was misleading. According to Kumar, "this happened because early writers were guided by genealogies of apprenticeship rather than their styles, worldviews, and perspectives on art practice".&lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Santiniketan: art movement and school==
{{History of art sidebar}}
Kumar draws distinction between ''Santiniketan the art movement'' and ''Santiniketan the School'':

{{Quotation| I am not sure, however, if everyone noticed the distinction I drew between Santiniketan as an art movement and Santiniketan as a school very clearly. There was both a Santiketan movement and a Santiniketan school, but these are two different things. The movement was shaped by the practices of the masters, chiefly Nandalal, Benodebehari, Ramkinkar and Rabindranath. Their art practices were interrelated but did not stylistically converge. They were linked more by concerns and as participants in a discourse to which each contributed in a different manner. They themselves saw this very clearly but many who wrote about them did not. They either plumped for Nandalal and Benodebehari, or for Ramkinkar and Rabindranath; one pair representing a traditionalist position and the other a modernist position. I am not suggesting that there are no differences between them but that they saw themselves as co-authors of an art scene being essayed around shared issues, complementing each other and expanding their concerns and reach rather than at war with each other.|''ALL THE SHARED EXPERIENCES OF THE LIVED WORLD &lt;ref&gt;http://humanitiesunderground.org/all-the-shared-experiences-of-the-lived-world-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==The shared perspectives==
{{Quotation|The brief survey of the individual works of the core Santiniketan artists and the thought perspectives they open up makes clear that though there were various contact points in the work they were not bound by a continuity of style but by a community of ideas. Which they not only shared but also interpreted and carried forward. Thus they do not represent a school but a movement.|''Santiniketan: The Making of a Contextual Modernism, 1997}}

'''Sharia''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|ə|ˈ|r|iː|ə}}), '''Sharia law''', or '''Islamic law''' ({{lang-ar|{{large|شريعة}}}} {{IPA-ar|ʃaˈriːʕa|}}) is a [[religious law]] forming part of the [[Islam]]ic tradition.&lt;ref name=oxforddic&gt;{{cite web |title=British &amp; World English: sharia |url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/sharia |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=4 December 2015 |location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the religious precepts of Islam, particularly the [[Quran]] and the [[Hadith]]. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the term ''sharīʿah'' refers to [[God in Islam|God]]'s immutable [[divine law]] and is contrasted with ''[[fiqh]]'', which refers to its human scholarly interpretations.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} It has been described as "one of the major intellectual achievements of Islam"&lt;ref name="Lewis-ME-223"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Bernard|title=The Middle East, a brief history of the last 2000 years|date=1995|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=NY|isbn=978-0684832807|page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its importance in Islam has been compared to that of [[theology]] in [[Christianity]].{{refn|group=note|"What theology is for the Christian, law is for the Muslim."&lt;ref name="Smith-1957-57"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=W|title=Islam in Modern History|date=1957|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; referenced in &lt;ref name="Forte-1978-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht|journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review|date=1978|volume=1|page=2|url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The manner of its application in modern times has been a subject of dispute between Muslim traditionalists and reformists.&lt;ref name=oxforddic/&gt;

Traditional [[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|theory of Islamic jurisprudence]] recognizes four [[sources of sharia]]: the Quran, ''[[sunnah]]'' (authentic hadith), ''[[qiyas]]'' (analogical reasoning), and ''[[ijma]]'' (juridical consensus).&lt;ref name="Esposito, John 2001"&gt;[[John Esposito|John L. Esposito]], [[Natana J. DeLong-Bas]] (2001), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=MOmaDq8HKCgC&amp;pg=PA2#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Women in Muslim family law]'', p. 2. [[Syracuse University Press]], {{ISBN|978-0815629085}}. Quote: "[...], by the ninth century, the classical theory of law fixed the sources of Islamic law at four: the ''Quran'', the ''Sunnah'' of the Prophet, ''qiyas'' (analogical reasoning), and ''ijma'' (consensus)."&lt;/ref&gt; Different [[Madhhab|legal schools]]—of which the most prominent are [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], [[Hanbali]] and [[Ja'fari jurisprudence|Jafari]]—developed methodologies for deriving sharia rulings from scriptural sources using a process known as ''[[ijtihad]]''.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Islamic Law |editor=John L.

Historically, sharia was interpreted by independent jurists ([[mufti]]s). Their legal opinions ([[fatwa]]s) were taken into account by ruler-appointed [[Qadi|judges]] who presided over ''[[qāḍī]]'s'' courts, and by ''maẓālim'' courts, which were controlled by the ruler's council and administered criminal law.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} [[Ottoman empire|Ottoman rulers]] achieved additional control over the legal system by promulgating their own legal code (''[[Qanun (law)|qanun]]'') and turning muftis into state employees.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Non-Muslim ([[dhimmi]]) communities had legal autonomy, except in cases of interconfessional disputes, which fell under jurisdiction of qadi's courts.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

In the modern era, sharia-based criminal laws have been widely replaced by statutes inspired by European models.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=19}} Judicial procedures and legal education in the Muslim world were likewise brought in line with European practice.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} While the constitutions of most Muslim-majority states contain references to sharia, its classical rules were largely retained only in [[Status (law)|personal status]] (family) laws.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Legislative bodies which codified these laws sought to modernize them without abandoning their foundations in traditional jurisprudence.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} The [[Islamic revival]] of the late 20th century brought along calls by [[Islamist]] movements for full implementation of sharia, including reinstatement of ''[[hudud]]'' corporal punishments, such as [[stoning]].{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}} In some cases, this resulted in traditionalist legal reform,{{refn|group=note|While the advocacy of ''hudud'' punishments has gained symbolic importance, and in theory often involved rejection of the stringent traditional restrictions on their application, in practice, in those few countries where they have been reintroduced, they have often been used sparingly or not at all. Their application has varied depending on local political climate.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=20}}}} while other countries witnessed juridical reinterpretation of sharia advocated by progressive reformers.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Mayer|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009}}

==Etymology and usage==

=== Contemporary usage ===

The word ''sharīʿah'' is used by Arabic-speaking peoples of the Middle East to designate a prophetic religion in its totality.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} For example, ''sharīʿat Mūsā'' means law or religion of Moses and ''sharīʿatu-nā'' can mean "our religion" in reference to any monotheistic faith.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} Within Islamic discourse, ''šarīʿah'' refers to religious regulations governing the lives of Muslims.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} For many Muslims, the word merely means "justice," and they will consider any law that promotes justice and social welfare to conform to sharia.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

Jan Michiel Otto distinguishes four senses conveyed by the term ''sharia'' in religious, legal and political discourse:{{sfn|Otto|2008|pp=9–10}}
* ''Divine, abstract sharia'': God's plan for mankind and the norms of behavior which should guide the Islamic community. Muslims of different perspectives agree in their respect for the abstract notion of sharia, but they differ in how they understand the practical implications of the term.
* ''Classical sharia'': the body of rules and principles elaborated by Islamic jurists during the first centuries of Islam.
* ''Historical sharia(s)'': the body of rules and interpretations developed throughout Islamic history, ranging from personal beliefs to state legislation and varying across an ideological spectrum. Classical sharia has often served as a point of reference for these variants, but they have also reflected the influences of their time and place.
* ''Contemporary sharia(s)'': the full spectrum of rules and interpretations that are developed and practiced at present.

A related term ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-qānūn al-islāmī}}'' ({{lang|ar|{{large|القانون الإسلامي}}}}, Islamic law), which was borrowed from European usage in the late 19th century, is used in the Muslim world to refer to a legal system in the context of a modern state.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=323}}

=== Etymology ===

The primary range of meanings of the Arabic word ''šarīʿah'', derived from the root ''š-r-ʕ'', is related to religion and religious law.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} The lexicographical tradition records two major areas of use where the word ''šarīʿah'' can appear without religious connotation.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} In texts evoking a pastoral or nomadic environment, the word, and its derivatives refer to watering animals at a permanent water-hole or to the seashore, with special reference to animals who come there.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} Another area of use relates to notions of stretched or lengthy.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} This range of meanings is cognate with the Hebrew ''saraʿ'' and is likely to be the origin of the meaning "way" or "path".{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}} Both these areas have been claimed to have Within rise to aspects of the religious meaning.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=326}}

Some scholars describe the word ''šarīʿah'' as an archaic [[Arabic]] word denoting "pathway to be followed" (analogous to the Hebrew term [[Halakha]]h ["The Way to Go"]),&lt;ref name=haqq&gt;Abdal-Haqq, Irshad (2006). ''Understanding Islamic Law&amp;nbsp;– From Classical to Contemporary'' (edited by Aminah Beverly McCloud). Chapter 1 ''Islamic Law&amp;nbsp;– An Overview of its Origin and Elements''. [[AltaMira Press]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; or "path to the water hole"&lt;ref name="Hashim1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hashim Kamali |first1=Mohammad |authorlink=Mohammad Hashim Kamali |title=Shari'ah Law: An Introduction |date=2008 |publisher=[[Oneworld Publications]] |isbn=978-1851685653 |pages=2, 14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=weiss1998/&gt; and argue that its adoption as a metaphor for a divinely ordained way of life arises from the importance of water in an arid desert environment.&lt;ref name=weiss1998&gt;Weiss, Bernard G. (1998). ''The Spirit of Islamic Law''. Athens, Georgia: [[University of Georgia Press]]. p. 17. {{ISBN|978-0820319773}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Use in religious texts ===

In the Quran, ''šarīʿah'' and its cognate ''širʿah'' occur once each, with the meaning "way" or "path".{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} The word ''šarīʿah'' was widely used by Arabic-speaking Jews during the Middle Ages, being the most common translation for the word ''torah'' in the 10th-century Arabic Old Testament known as Saʿadya Gaon.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} A similar use of the term can be found in Christian writers.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=321}} The Arabic expression ''Sharīʿat Allāh'' (&lt;span lang="ar" dir="ltr"&gt;شريعة الله&lt;/span&gt; "God’s Law") is a common translation for תורת אלוהים (‘God’s Law’ in Hebrew) and νόμος τοῦ θεοῦ (‘God’s Law’ in Greek in the New Testament [Rom. 7: 22]).&lt;ref&gt;Ullmann, M. (2002), Wörterbuch der griechisch-arabischen Übersetzungen des neunten Jahrhunderts, Wiesbaden, p. 437. Rom. 7: 22: ‘συνήδομαι γὰρ τῷ νόμῳ τοῦ θεοῦ’ is translated as ‘أني أفرح بشريعة الله’&lt;/ref&gt; In Muslim literature, ''šarīʿah'' designates the laws or message of a prophet or God, in contrast to ''[[fiqh]]'', which refers to a scholar's interpretation thereof.{{sfn|Calder|Hooker|2007|p=322}}

==Historical origins==
{{Further|Fiqh|Madhhab|Ahl al-Hadith}}

[[File:Ibnhanbal.jpg|thumb|Juristic exchange between [[Abu Dawood]] and [[Ibn Hanbal]]. One of the oldest literary manuscripts of the Islamic world, dated October 879.]]

According to the traditional Muslim view, there was no "historical development" of Islamic law and its major precepts were all known and passed down directly from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name="Forte-1978-8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=David F.|title=Islamic Law; the impact of Joseph Schacht| journal=Loyola Los Angeles International and Comparative Law Review|date=1978|volume=1|page=8|url=http://www.soerenkern.com/pdfs/islam/IslamicLawTheImpactofJosephSchacht.pdf|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of Islamic jurisprudence (''fiqh'') also goes back to the lifetime of Muhammad.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In this view, his [[Sahaba|companions]] and followers took what he did and approved of as a model ([[sunnah]]) and transmitted this information to the succeeding generations in the form of [[hadith]].{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} These reports led first to informal discussion and then systematic legal thought, articulated with greatest success in the eighth and ninth centuries by the master jurists [[Abu Hanifah]], [[Malik ibn Anas]], [[Al-Shafi‘i]], and [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], who are viewed as the founders of the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafiʿi]], and [[Hanbali]] legal schools (''[[madhhab]]s'') of Sunni jurisprudence.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}

Modern historians have presented alternative theories of the formation of fiqh.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Calder|2009}} At first Western scholars accepted the general outlines of the traditional account.{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}} In the late 19th century, an influential [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] hypothesis was advanced by [[Ignac Goldziher]] and elaborated by [[Joseph Schacht]] in the mid-20th century.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} Schacht and other scholars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown |first1=Daniel W.|title=Rethinking tradition in modern Islamic thought |date=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521570770 |url=https://www.scribd.com/document/116836545/Rethinking-Traditions-in-Modern-Islamic-Thought-Daniel-w-Brown |accessdate=10 May 2018 |ref=DWBRTMIT1996 |pages=18–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that the local practices of early Muslim communities (which Schacht calls the `living tradition` of the `ancient schools of law`) and earliest efforts at Islamic jurisprudence{{refn|group=note|“... the essential features of old Muhammadan jurisprudence, such as the idea of the `living tradition` of the ancient schools of law; a body of common doctrine expressing the earliest effort to systematize;  legal maxims which often reflect a slightly later stage, and an important nucleus of legal traditions ... it is safe to say that [this] Muhammadan legal science started in the later part of the Umaiyad period, taking the legal practice of the time as its raw material and endorsing, modifying, or rejecting it, ...” ,&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-190&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |orig-year= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=190 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} were based on a variety of sources, not just the ahadith of Muhammad.{{refn|group=note|“In the time of Shafi’i, traditions from the Prophet were already recognized as one of the material bases of Muhammadan law. Their position in the ancient schools of law was, as we have seen, much less certain.”&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-40&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=40  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} {{refn|group=note|another example is that an early major works of fiqh — [[Muwatta Imam Malik]] (edited by Shaibani) — contains 429 ahadith by Muhammad but  750 by the [[Sahabah|Companions]], [[Tabi‘un|Successors]] and others,&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-22&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |orig-year= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to later works by al-Bukhari, Muslim, etc. that contain only ahadith by Muhammad}}
Furthermore, most hadith and their [[Hadith studies#Sanad and matn|chains of transmission]] were actually created at a later date {{refn|group=note|”a great many traditions in the classical and other collections were put into circulation only after Shafi'i's time;
the first considerable body of legal traditions from the Prophet originated towards the middle of the second century, …”&lt;ref name=Schacht-OoMJ-1959-4&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Muhammadan Jurisprudence |last1=Schacht |first=Joseph |publisher=Oxford University Press |origyear= 1950 |year= 1959 |page=4  }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
and extended back to Muhammad's companions (despite the efforts of hadith scholars to uncover fabricated isnads), when it became accepted that legal norms must be formally grounded in scriptural sources.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In his view, the real architect of Islamic jurisprudence was al-Shafi'i, who formulated this and other elements of classical legal theory in his work ''[[Al-Risala (Al-Shafi‘i)|al-risala]]'',{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}} but who was preceded by a body of Islamic law not based on primacy of ahadith of  Muhammad. (Muhammad died in 632 CE while Al-Shafi’i began to establish an independent line of legal speculation in 810.) These accounts gave rise to objections, and modern historians generally adopt more cautious, intermediate positions.{{sfn|Jokisch|2015}}

While the origin of hadith remains a subject of scholarly controversy, it is generally accepted that early Islamic jurisprudence developed out of a combination of administrative and popular practices shaped by the religious and ethical precepts of Islam.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} It continued some aspects of pre-Islamic laws and customs of the lands that fell under Muslim rule in the aftermath of the [[Early Muslim conquests|early conquests]] and modified other aspects, aiming to meet the practical need of establishing Islamic norms of behavior and adjudicating disputes arising in the early Muslim communities.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}} Juristic thought gradually developed in study circles, where independent scholars met to learn from a local master and discuss religious topics.{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=125}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31–35}} At first, these circles were fluid in their membership, but with time distinct regional legal schools crystallized around shared sets of methodological principles.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31–35}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} As the boundaries of the schools became clearly delineated, the authority of their doctrinal tenets came to be vested in a master jurist from earlier times, who was henceforth identified as the school's founder.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=31–35}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} In the course of the first three centuries of Islam, all legal schools came to accept the broad outlines of classical legal theory, according to which Islamic law had to be firmly rooted in the Quran and hadith.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Lapidus|2014|p=130}}

== Traditional jurisprudence (''fiqh'') ==

{{Main|Fiqh}}

Fiqh is traditionally divided into the fields of ''[[Principles of Islamic jurisprudence|uṣūl al-fiqh]]'' (lit. the roots of fiqh), which studies the theoretical principles of jurisprudence, and ''furūʿ al-fiqh'' (lit. the branches of fiqh), which is devoted to elaboration of rulings on the basis of these principles.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}

=== Principles of jurisprudence (''uṣūl al-fiqh'') ===

{{Main|Principles of Islamic jurisprudence}}

Classical jurists held that human reason is a gift from God which should be exercised to its fullest capacity.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}} However, they believed that use of reason alone is insufficient to distinguish right from wrong, and that rational argumentation must draw its content from the body of transcendental knowledge revealed in the Quran and through the sunnah of Muhammad.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=15}}

Traditional theory of Islamic jurisprudence elaborates how scriptures should be interpreted from the standpoint of linguistics and rhetoric.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} It also comprises methods for establishing authenticity of hadith and for determining when the legal force of a scriptural passage is [[Naskh (tafsir)|abrogated]] by a passage revealed at a later date.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} In addition to the Quran and sunnah, the classical theory of Sunni fiqh recognizes two other sources of law: juristic consensus (''[[Ijma|ijmaʿ]]'') and analogical reasoning (''[[qiyas]]'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} It therefore studies the application and limits of analogy, as well as the value and limits of consensus, along with other methodological principles, some of which are accepted by only certain legal schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} This interpretive apparatus is brought together under the rubric of [[ijtihad]], which refers to a jurist's exertion in an attempt to arrive at a ruling on a particular question.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The theory of [[Twelver Shia]] jurisprudence parallels that of Sunni schools with some differences, such as recognition of reason (''[['Aql|ʿaql]]'') as a source of law in place of ''qiyas'' and extension of the notion of sunnah to include traditions of the [[The Twelve Imams|imams]].{{sfn|Kamali|1999|pp=121–22}}

==== Sources of sharia ====

{{Main|Sources of sharia}}
* ''[[Quran]]'': In Islam, the Quran is considered to be the most sacred source of law.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Classical jurists held its textual integrity to be beyond doubt on account of it having been handed down by many people in each generation, which is known as "recurrence" or "concurrent transmission" (''tawātur'').{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Only several hundred verses of the Quran have direct legal relevance, and they are concentrated in a few specific areas such as inheritance, though other passages have been used as a source for general principles whose legal ramifications were elaborated by other means.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}}
* ''[[Hadith]]'': The body of hadith provides more detailed and practical legal guidance, but it was recognized early on that not all of them were authentic.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Early Islamic scholars developed a methodology for evaluating their authenticity by assessing trustworthiness of the individuals listed in their transmission chains.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} These criteria narrowed down the vast corpus of prophetic traditions to several thousand "sound" hadiths, which were collected in several canonical compilations.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} The hadiths which enjoyed concurrent transmission were deemed unquestionably authentic; however, the vast majority of hadiths were handed down by only one or a few transmitters and were therefore seen to yield only probable knowledge.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16-18}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} The uncertainty was further compounded by ambiguity of the language contained in some hadiths and Quranic passages.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=16–18}} Disagreements on the relative merits and interpretation of the textual sources allowed legal scholars considerable leeway in formulating alternative rulings.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}
* ''Consensus ([[ijma]])'' could in principle elevate a ruling based on probable evidence to absolute certainty.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} This classical doctrine drew its authority from a series of hadiths stating that the Islamic community could never agree on an error.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}} This form of consensus was technically defined as agreement of all competent jurists in any particular generation, acting as representatives of the community.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Kamali|1999|p=146}} However, the practical difficulty of obtaining and ascertaining such an agreement meant that it had little impact on legal development.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} A more pragmatic form of consensus, which could be determined by consulting works of prominent jurists, was used to confirm a ruling so that it could not be reopened for further discussion.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The cases for which there was a consensus account for less than 1 percent of the body of classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=21–22}}
* ''Analogical reasoning ([[qiyas]])'': Qiyas is used to derive a ruling for a situation not addressed in the scripture by analogy with a scripturally based rule.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} In a classic example, the Quranic prohibition of drinking wine is extended to all intoxicating substances, on the basis of the "cause"  (''ʿilla'') shared by these situations, which in this case is identified to be intoxication.{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} Since the cause of a rule may not be apparent, its selection commonly occasioned controversy and extensive debate.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=23–24}} Twelver Shia jurisprudence does not recognize the use of qiyas, but relies on reason (''ʿaql'') in its place.{{sfn|Schneider|2014}}

==== Ijtihad ====

{{Main|Ijtihad}}

[[File:Türkischer Mufti.jpg|thumb|Turkish mufti (17th-century Spanish drawing)]]

The classical process of ijtihad combined these generally recognized principles with other methods, which were not adopted by all legal schools, such as ''[[istihsan]]'' (juristic preference), ''[[istislah]]'' (consideration of public interest) and ''[[istishab]]'' (presumption of continuity).{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}} A jurist who is qualified to practice ijtihad is known as a ''mujtahid''.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} The use of independent reasoning to arrive at a ruling is contrasted with ''[[taqlid]]'' (imitation), which refers to following the rulings of a mujtahid.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} By the beginning of the 10th century, development of Sunni jurisprudence prompted leading jurists to state that the main legal questions had been addressed and the scope of ijtihad was gradually restricted.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}} From the 18th century on, leading Muslim reformers began calling for abandonment of taqlid and renewed emphasis on ijtihad, which they saw as a return to the vitality of early Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Rabb|2009c}}

==== Decision types (''aḥkām'') ====

{{Main|Ahkam}}

Sharia rulings fall into one of five categories known as “the five decisions” (''al-aḥkām al-khamsa''): [[Fard|mandatory]] (''farḍ'' or ''wājib''), [[Mustahabb|recommended]] (''mandūb'' or ''mustaḥabb''), [[Mubah|neutral]] (''mubāḥ''), [[Makruh|reprehensible]] (''makrūh''), and [[Haram|forbidden]] (''ḥarām'').{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} It is a sin or a crime to perform a forbidden action or not to perform a mandatory action.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Reprehensible acts should be avoided, but they are not considered to be sinful or punishable in court.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Avoiding reprehensible acts and performing recommended acts is held to be subject of reward in the afterlife, while allowed actions entail no judgement from God.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|p=20}} Jurists disagree on whether the term ''[[Halal|ḥalāl]]'' covers the first three or the first four categories.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The legal and moral verdict depends on whether the action is committed out of necessity (''ḍarūra'').{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

==== Aims of sharia and public interest ====

{{Main|Maqasid|Maslaha}}

''Maqāṣid'' (aims or purposes) of sharia  and ''maṣlaḥa'' (welfare or public interest) are two related classical doctrines which have come to play an increasingly prominent role in modern times.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} They were first clearly articulated by [[al-Ghazali]] (d. 1111), who argued that ''maslaha'' was God's general purpose in revealing the divine law, and that its specific aim was preservation of five essentials of human well-being: religion, life, intellect, offspring, and property.{{sfn|Opwis|2007|p=65}} Although most classical-era jurists recognized ''maslaha'' and ''maqasid'' as important legal principles, they held different views regarding the role they should play in Islamic law.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Gleave|2012}} Some jurists viewed them as auxiliary rationales constrained by scriptural sources and analogical reasoning.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=66–68}} Others regarded them as an independent source of law, whose general principles could override specific inferences based on the letter of scripture.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Opwis|2007|pp=68–69}} While the latter view was held by a minority of classical jurists, in modern times it came to be championed in different forms by prominent scholars who sought to adapt Islamic law to changing social conditions by drawing on the intellectual heritage of traditional jurisprudence.{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009}}{{sfn|Brown|2009}} These scholars expanded the inventory of ''maqasid'' to include such aims of sharia as reform and women's rights ([[Rashid Rida]]); justice and freedom ([[Mohammed al-Ghazali]]); and human dignity and rights ([[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]]).{{sfn|Duderija|2014|pp=2–6}}

===Branches of law===
{{Fiqh}}
{{Further|Topics of sharia law}}
The domain of ''furūʿ al-fiqh'' (lit. branches of fiqh) is traditionally divided into ''ʿibādāt'' (rituals or acts of worship) and ''muʿāmalāt'' (social relations).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Many jurists further divided the body of substantive jurisprudence into "the four quarters", called rituals, sales, marriage and injuries.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Each of these terms figuratively stood for a variety of subjects.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} For example, the quarter of sales would encompass partnerships, guaranty, gifts, and bequests, among other topics.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} Juristic works were arranged as a sequence of such smaller topics, each called a "book" (''kitab'').{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}} The special significance of ritual was marked by always placing its discussion at the start of the work.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=28-30}}

Some historians distinguish a field of Islamic criminal law, which combines several traditional categories.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}{{sfn|Schneider|2014}} Several crimes with scripturally prescribed punishments are known as ''[[hudud]]''.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Jurists developed various restrictions which in many cases made them virtually impossible to apply.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} Other crimes involving intentional bodily harm are judged according to a version of ''[[lex talionis]]'' that prescribes a punishment analogous to the crime (''[[qisas]]''), but the victims or their heirs may accept a monetary compensation (''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'') or pardon the perpetrator instead; only ''diya'' is imposed for non-intentional harm.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} Other criminal cases belong to the category of ''[[Tazir|taʿzīr]]'', where the goal of punishment is correction or rehabilitation of the culprit and its form is largely left to the judge's discretion.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}} In practice, since early on in Islamic history, criminal cases were usually handled by ruler-administered courts or local police using procedures which were only loosely related to sharia.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Ziadeh|2009c}}

The two major genres of ''furūʿ'' literature are the ''mukhtasar'' (concise summary of law) and the ''mabsut'' (extensive commentary).{{sfn|Calder|2009}}  ''Mukhtasars'' were short specialized treatises or general overviews that could be used in a classroom or consulted by judges.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} A ''mabsut'', which usually provided a commentary on a ''mukhtasar'' and could stretch to dozens of large volumes, recorded alternative rulings with their justifications, often accompanied by a proliferation of cases and conceptual distinctions.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} The terminology of juristic literature was conservative and tended to preserve notions which had lost their practical relevance.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} At the same time, the cycle of abridgement and commentary allowed jurists of each generation to articulate a modified body of law to meet changing social conditions.{{sfn|Hallaq|2009|pp=10-11}} Other juristic genres include the ''qawāʿid'' (succinct formulas meant to aid the student remember general principles) and collections of fatwas by a particular scholar.{{sfn|Vikør|2014}}

===Schools of law===
{{main article|Madhhab}}
[[File:Madhhab Map3.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Predominant madhhab by region of the Muslim world]]

The main Sunni schools of law (''madhhabs'') are the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]] and [[Hanbali]] madhhabs.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} They emerged in the ninth and tenth centuries and by the twelfth century almost all jurists aligned themselves with a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} These four schools recognize each other's validity and they have interacted in legal debate over the centuries.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}} Rulings of these schools are followed across the Muslim world without exclusive regional restrictions, but they each came to dominate in different parts of the world.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}  For example, the Maliki school is predominant in North and West Africa; the Hanafi school in South and Central Asia; the Shafi'i school in Lower Egypt, East Africa, and Southeast Asia; and the Hanbali school in North and Central Arabia.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The first centuries of Islam also witnessed a number of short-lived Sunni madhhabs.{{sfn|Calder|2009}} The [[Zahiri]] school, which is commonly identified as extinct, continues to exert influence over legal thought.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The development of Shia legal schools occurred along the lines of theological differences and resulted in formation of the [[Twelver]], [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] and [[Ismaili]] madhhabs, whose differences from Sunni legal schools are roughly of the same order as the differences among Sunni schools.{{sfn|Calder|2009}}{{sfn|Vikør|2014}} The [[Ibadi]] legal school, distinct from Sunni and Shia madhhabs, is predominant in Oman.{{sfn|Rabb|2009b}}

The transformations of Islamic legal institutions in the modern era have had profound implications for the madhhab system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}  Legal practice in most of the Muslim world has come to be controlled by government policy and state law, so that the influence of the madhhabs beyond personal ritual practice depends on the status accorded to them within the national legal system.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} State law codification commonly utilized the methods of ''takhayyur'' (selection of rulings without restriction to a particular madhhab) and ''talfiq'' (combining parts of different rulings on the same question).{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Legal professionals trained in modern law schools have largely replaced traditional [[ulema]] as interpreters of the resulting laws.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Global Islamic movements have at times drawn on different madhhabs and at other times placed greater focus on the scriptural sources rather than classical jurisprudence.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} The Hanbali school, with its particularly strict adherence to the Quran and hadith, has inspired conservative currents of direct scriptural interpretation by the [[Salafi]] and [[Wahhabi]] movements.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}} Other currents, such as networks of Indonesian ulema and Islamic scholars residing in Muslim-minority countries, have advanced liberal interpretations of Islamic law without focusing on traditions of a particular madhhab.{{sfn|Hussin|2014}}

===Social context===
{{Islamism sidebar|Concepts}}

From the 9th century onward, the power to interpret law in traditional Islamic societies was in the hands of the scholars ([[ulema]]). This separation of powers served to limit the range of actions available to the ruler, who could not easily decree or reinterpret law independently and expect the continued support of the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Basim Musallam |title=The Ordering of Muslims Societies |encyclopedia=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |editor=[[Francis Robinson]] |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=1996 |page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through succeeding centuries and empires, the balance between the ulema and the rulers shifted and reformed, but the balance of power was never decisively changed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''[[The Venture of Islam]] Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 3''. [[University of Chicago]], 1958, pp. 105–08.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of many centuries, imperial, political and technological change, including the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution, ushered in an era of European world [[hegemony]] that gradually included the domination of many of the lands which had previously been ruled by Islamic empires.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 3''. [[University of Chicago]], 1958, pp. 176–77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Ansari, ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World edited by Francis Robinson''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 1996, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the Second World War, the European powers found themselves too weakened to maintain their empires as before.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marshall Hodgson]], ''The Venture of Islam Conscience and History in a World Civilization Vol 3''. [[University of Chicago]], 1958, pp. 366–67.&lt;/ref&gt; The wide variety of forms of government, systems of law, attitudes toward modernity and interpretations of sharia are a result of the ensuing drives for independence and modernity in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Ansari, Sarah.

Most Muslim-majority countries incorporate sharia at some level in their legal framework, with many calling it the highest law or the source of law of the land in their constitution.&lt;ref name=tjmas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cfr.org/religion/islam-governing-under-sharia/p8034 |title=Islam: Governing under Sharia |first1=Toni |last1=Johnson |first2=Mohammed Aly |last2=Sergie |publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]] |date=July 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amanat &amp; Griffel (2007), ''Shari'a: Islamic Law in the Contemporary Context'', Stanford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0804756396}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most use sharia for personal law (marriage, divorce, domestic violence, child support, family law, inheritance and such matters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schenker |first1=J G |title=Women's reproductive health: monotheistic religious perspectives |journal=International Journal of Gynecology &amp; Obstetrics |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=77–86 |year=2000 |pmid=10884536 |doi=10.1016/S0020-7292(00)00225-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Khadduri|Liebesny|1955|p={{page needed|date=April 2016}}}} Elements of sharia are present, to varying extents, in the criminal justice system of many Muslim-majority countries.&lt;ref name=nabiad/&gt; [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Yemen]], [[Brunei]], [[Qatar]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Iraq]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Sudan]] and [[Mauritania]] apply the code predominantly or entirely while it applies in some parts of [[Pakistan]] and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=nabiad&gt;Nisrine Abiad (2008), Sharia, Muslim States and International Human Rights Treaty Obligations, British Institute of International and Comparative Law, {{ISBN|978-1905221417}}{{Page needed|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Otto|2010|p=28}}

Since the 1970s, most Muslim-majority countries have faced vociferous demands from their religious groups and political parties for immediate adoption of sharia as the sole, or at least primary, legal framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Abdullahi Ahmed |last1=An-Na'im |title=Human Rights in the Muslim World: Socio-Political Conditions and Scriptural Imperatives |journal=Harvard Human Rights Journal |volume=3 |year=1990 |pages=13–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some moderates and liberal scholars within these Muslim-majority countries have argued for limited expansion of sharia.{{sfn|Otto|2010|pp=29–33}}

With the growing Muslim immigrant communities in Western Europe, there have been reports in some media of "no-go zones" being established where sharia law reigns supreme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/11/02/swedish-police-release-extensive-report-detailing-control-of-55-no-go-zones-by-muslim-criminal-gangs/ |title=Swedish Police Lose Control Of 55 No-Go Zones To Muslim Gangs |publisher=[[The Daily Caller]] |accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/19/politics/jindal-no-go-zones-london/index.html |title=Bobby Jindal slams 'no-go zones,' pushes 'assimilation' |first1=Alexandra |last1=Jaffe |date=19 January 2015 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no evidence of the existence of "no-go zones", and these allegations are sourced from anti-immigrant groups falsely equating low-income neighborhoods predominantly inhabited by immigrants with "no-go zones".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/01/18/media/fox-apologizes-for-anti-islam-comments/index.html |title=Fox News apologizes 4 times for inaccurate comments about Muslims in Europe |first1=Brian |last1=Stelter |date=18 January 2015 |publisher=CNNMoney |accessdate=22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/jindal-condemns-imaginary-no-go-zones |title=Jindal condemns imaginary 'no-go zones' |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=22 March 2015|date=2015-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the [[Muslim Arbitration Tribunal]] makes use of sharia family law to settle disputes, though this limited adoption of sharia is controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Taher, Abul (September 14, 2008).

===Enforcement===
{{main article|Islamic religious police|Hisbah}}
Sharia is enforced in Muslim-majority nations in a number of ways, including ''mutaween'' (police enforcement) and ''hisbah''. [[mutaween]] ({{lang-ar|{{large|المطوعين، مطوعية}}}} ''{{transl|ar|muṭawwiʿīn, muṭawwiʿiyyah}}'')&lt;ref&gt;''muṭawiʿin''; variant English spellings: mutawwain, muttawa, mutawallees, mutawa’ah, mutawi’, mutawwa' most literally means "volunteers" in the Arabic language, ''[[Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic]]'' by Hans Wehr, edited by J. M. Cowan, 4th edition (1994, {{ISBN|0879500034}}), p. 670.&lt;/ref&gt; are the government-authorized or government-recognized religious police (or clerical [[police]]) of [[Saudi Arabia]]. Elsewhere, enforcement of Islamic values in accordance with sharia is the responsibility of the ''Polisi Perda Syariah Islam'' in Aceh province of [[Indonesia]],&lt;ref&gt;Fealy &amp; White (2008), ''Regional Sharia Regulations in Indonesia: Anomaly or Symptom?'', Chapter: Expressing Islam: Religious life and politics in Indonesia, {{ISBN|978-9812308511}}{{page needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (Gaza Strip)]] in parts of Palestine, and the [[Basij]]i Force in Iran.&lt;ref name="rferl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Irans_Basij_Force_Mainstay_Of_Domestic_Security/1357081.html |title=Iran's Basij Force&amp;nbsp;– The Mainstay Of Domestic Security|date= January 15, 2009 |work=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hisbah]] ({{lang-ar|{{large|حسبة}}}} ''ḥisb(ah)'', or hisba) is a historic Islamic doctrine which means "accountability".&lt;ref name=sz&gt;Sami Zubaida (2005), Law and Power in the Islamic World, {{ISBN|978-1850439349}}, pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt; Hisbah doctrine holds that it is a religious obligation of every Muslim that he or she report to the ruler (Sultan, government authorities) any wrong behavior of a neighbor or relative that violates sharia or insults Islam. The doctrine states that it is the divinely sanctioned duty of the ruler to intervene when such charges are made, and coercively "command right and forbid wrong" in order to keep everything in order according to sharia.&lt;ref name=lv&gt;Lorenzo Vidino (2013), [http://www.css.ethz.ch/publications/pdfs/Hisba_in_Europe.pdf Hisba in Europe?], European Foundation for Democracy, Switzerland&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Cook (historian)|Michael Cook]]: ''Commanding right and forbidding wrong in Islamic thought.''

===Legal and court proceedings===
{{anchor|Courts}}
[[File:Malacca State Syariah Court.JPG|thumb|Shariah Court in [[Malacca]], [[Malaysia]].]]

Sharia judicial proceedings have significant differences from other legal traditions, including those in both [[common law]] and [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]]. Sharia courts traditionally do not rely on lawyers; [[plaintiffs]] and [[defendants]] represent themselves. Trials are conducted solely by the judge, and there is no jury system. There is no pre-trial [[Discovery (law)|discovery]] process, and no [[cross-examination]] of witnesses. Unlike common law, judges' verdicts do not set binding [[precedents]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.jrank.org/pages/7816/Law-Islamic.html Islamic Law&amp;nbsp;– Legal Literature And Institutions, Jurisprudence: The "Sources" of the Law, The Modern Period].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ddc.aub.edu.lb/projects/pspa/qatar.html |title=Qatar: The Duality of the Legal System |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/delawarestatecases/493-2003.pdf ''Saudi Arabia Basic Industries Corp. v. Mobil Yanbu Petrochemical Co.'', Supreme Court of Delaware, January 14, 2005 p. 52]. "The Saudi law system differs in critically important respects from the system of legal thought employed by the common law countries, including the United States. Perhaps most significant is that Islamic law does not embrace the common law system of binding precedent and ''stare decisis''. In Saudi Arabia, judicial decisions are not in themselves a source of law, and with minor exceptions, court decisions in Saudi Arabia are not published or even open to public inspection."&lt;/ref&gt; and unlike civil law, sharia is left to the interpretation in each case and has no formally [[Codification (law)|codified]] universal statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Tetley (1999), Mixed Jurisdictions: Common Law v. Civil Law (Codified and Uncodified), La. Law Review, 60, 677&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[rules of evidence]] in sharia courts also maintain a distinctive custom of prioritizing oral testimony.&lt;ref&gt;Fortna, Benjamin C. (March 2011). "Education and Autobiography at the End of the Ottoman Empire". ''[[Die Welt des Islams]]''. New Series, Vol. 41, Issue 1. p. 131. "the literacy rate in the Ottoman Empire in 1900 was between five and ten percent".&lt;/ref&gt; Witnesses, in a sharia court system, must be faithful, that is Muslim.&lt;ref name=av1&gt;Antoinette Vlieger (2012), Domestic Workers in Saudi Arabia and the Emirates, {{ISBN|978-1610271288}}, Chapter 4{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male Muslim witnesses are deemed more reliable than female Muslim witnesses, and non-Muslim witnesses considered unreliable and receive no priority in a sharia court.&lt;ref&gt;Tahir Wasti (2009), The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan, Brill Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004172258}}, pp. 126–27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Etannibi E. O. Alemika (2005), "Human Rights and Shariah Penal Code in Northern Nigeria", ''UN Human Rights Monitor'', pp. 110–27&lt;/ref&gt; In civil cases in some countries, a Muslim woman witness is considered half the worth and reliability than a Muslim man witness.&lt;ref name=unicef2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=mfdl1/&gt; In criminal cases, women witnesses are unacceptable in stricter, traditional interpretations of sharia, such as those found in [[Hanbali]] madhhab.&lt;ref name=av1/&gt;

====Criminal cases====
A confession, an oath, or the oral testimony of Muslim witnesses are the main evidence admissible, in sharia courts, for hudud crimes, that is the religious crimes of adultery, fornication, rape, accusing someone of illicit sex but failing to prove it, [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]], drinking intoxicants and theft.&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed S.

Testimony to establish the crime of adultery, fornication or rape must be from four Muslim male witnesses, with some [[fiqh]]s allowing substitution of up to three male with six female witnesses; however, at least one must be a Muslim male.&lt;ref&gt;Ajijola, Alhaji A.D. (1989). ''Introduction to Islamic Law''. Karachi: International Islamic Publishers. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Forensic identification|Forensic evidence]] (''i.e.'', fingerprints, ballistics, blood samples, DNA etc.) and other [[circumstantial evidence]] is likewise rejected in [[hudud]] cases in favor of eyewitnesses, a practice which can cause severe difficulties for women plaintiffs in rape cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kamali |first1=Mohammad Hashim |authorlink=Mohammad Hashim Kamali |year=1998 |title=Punishment in Islamic Law: A Critique of the Hudud Bill of Kelantan, Malaysia |jstor=3382008 |journal=[[Arab Law Quarterly]] |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=203–34 |doi=10.1163/026805598125826102}}{{qn|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mohd Noor |first1=Azman |last2=Ibrahim |first2=Ahmad Basri |year=2008 |title=The rights of a rape victim in Islamic Law |journal=IIUM Law Journal |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=65–83 |url=http://irep.iium.edu.my/id/eprint/5699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslim jurists have debated whether and when coerced confession and coerced witnesses are acceptable.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} In the Ottoman Criminal Code, the executive officials were allowed to use torture only if the accused had a bad reputation and there were already indications of his guilt, such as when stolen goods were found in his house, if he was accused of grievous bodily harm by the victim or if a criminal during investigation mentioned him as an accomplice.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rudolph |last1=Peters |title=Crime and Punishment in Islamic Law |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0521796705 |date=2006 |pages=81–82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confessions obtained under torture could not be used as a ground for awarding punishment unless they were corroborated by circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Press"/&gt;

====Civil cases====
{{cite quran|2|282 |s=nosup}} recommends written financial contracts with reliable witnesses, although there is dispute about equality of female testimony.&lt;ref name=mfdl1&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fadel |first1=Mohammad |title=Two Women, One Man: Knowledge, Power, and Gender in Medieval Sunni Legal Thought |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=29 |issue=2 |year=2009 |pages=185–204 |ssrn=1113891 |jstor=164016 |doi=10.1017/S0020743800064461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marriage is solemnized as a written financial contract, in the presence of two Muslim male witnesses, and it includes a brideprice ([[Mahr]]) payable from a Muslim man to a Muslim woman. The brideprice is considered by a sharia court as a form of debt. Written contracts are paramount in sharia courts in the matters of dispute that are debt-related, which includes marriage contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paul Powers |date=2005 |title=Intent in Islamic Law: Motive and Meaning in Medieval Sunnī Fiqh |publisher=Brill Academic |isbn=978-9004145924 |pages=97–110, 125–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Written contracts in debt-related cases, when notarized by a judge, is deemed more reliable.&lt;ref name=remes1/&gt;

In commercial and civil contracts, such as those relating to exchange of merchandise, agreement to supply or purchase goods or property, and others, oral contracts and the testimony of Muslim witnesses triumph over written contracts. Sharia system has held that written commercial contracts may be forged.&lt;ref name=remes1&gt;Reem Meshal (2014), ''Sharia and the Making of the Modern Egyptian'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-9774166174}}, pp. 96–101 and Chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=timku1&gt;Timur Kuran (2012), The Long Divergence: How Islamic Law Held Back the Middle East, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691156415}}, pp. 246–49 and Chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timur Kuran]] states that the treatment of written evidence in religious courts in Islamic regions created an incentive for opaque transactions, and the avoidance of written contracts in economic relations. This led to a continuation of a "largely oral contracting culture" in Muslim-majority nations and communities.&lt;ref name=timku1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/private/ierc/conference_registration/papers/Kuran.pdf "Explaining the Economic Trajectories of Civilizations&amp;nbsp;– Musings on the Systemic Approach"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020235639/http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/private/ierc/conference_registration/papers/Kuran.pdf |date=2014-10-20 }} pp. 7, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In lieu of written evidence, oaths are accorded much greater weight; rather than being used simply to guarantee the truth of ensuing testimony, they are themselves used as evidence. Plaintiffs lacking other evidence to support their claims may demand that defendants take an oath swearing their innocence, refusal thereof can result in a verdict for the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;Lippman, Matthew Ross; McConville, Seán; Yerushalmi, Mordechai (1988). ''Islamic Criminal Law and Procedure&amp;nbsp;– An Introduction''. New York City: [[Praeger Publishers]]. p. 71. {{ISBN|978-0275930097}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking an oath for Muslims can be a grave act; one study of courts in Morocco found that lying litigants would often "maintain their testimony right up to the moment of oath-taking and then to stop, refuse the oath, and surrender the case."&lt;ref name="frank"&gt;Frank, Michael J. (April 2006). "Trying Times&amp;nbsp;– The Prosecution of Terrorists in the Central Criminal Court of Iraq". ''[[Florida Journal of International Law]]''.{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, defendants are not routinely required to swear before testifying, which would risk casually profaning the Quran should the defendant commit perjury;&lt;ref name="frank"/&gt; instead oaths are a solemn procedure performed as a final part of the evidence process.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

====Diya====
{{main article|Diya (Islam)}}

In classical jurisprudence monetary compensation for bodily harm (''[[Diya (Islam)|diya]]'' or blood money) is assessed differently for different classes of victims. For example, for Muslim women the amount was half that assessed for a Muslim man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Arsani |last1=William |title=An Unjust Doctrine of Civil Arbitration: Sharia Courts in Canada and England |journal=Stanford Journal of International Relations |date=Spring 2010 |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=40–47 |url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/sjir/pdf/Sharia_11.2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M Kar (2005), Encyclopedia of Women and Islamic Cultures: Family, Law and Politics (Ed: Suad Joseph, Afsāna Naǧmābādī), Brill, {{ISBN|978-9004128187}}, pp. 406–07&lt;/ref&gt; ''Diya'' for the death of a free Muslim man is twice as high as for Jewish and Christian victims according to the Maliki and Hanbali madhhabs and three times as high according to Shafi'i rules.&lt;ref name=ame1/&gt; Several legals schools assessed ''diya'' for [[Magians]] (''[[majus]]'') at one-fifteenth the value of a free Muslim male.&lt;ref name=ame1&gt;Anver M.

Modern countries which incorporate classical ''diya'' rules into their legal system treat them in different ways. The Pakistan Penal Code modernized the Hanafi doctrine by eliminating distinctions between Muslims and non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Application of Islamic Criminal Law in Pakistan |author=Tahir Wasti |publisher=Brill |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=88-XutlkJAQC&amp;pg=PA49 |page=49 |year=2009 |isbn=978-9004172258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Iran, ''diya'' for non-Muslim victims professing one of the faiths protected under the constitution (Jews, Christians, and Zoroastrians) was made equal to ''diya'' for Muslims in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Oxford Handbook of Criminal Law |editors=Markus D.

A 2013 survey based on interviews of 38,000 Muslims, randomly selected from urban and rural parts in 39 countries using area probability designs, by the [[Pew Forum|Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life]] found that a majority—in some cases "overwhelming" majority—of Muslims in a number of countries support making sharia the [[law of the land]], including Afghanistan (99%), Iraq (91%), Niger (86%), Malaysia (86%), Pakistan (84%), Morocco (83%), Bangladesh (82%), Egypt (74%), Indonesia (72%), Jordan (71%), Uganda (66%), Ethiopia (65%), Mali (63%), Ghana (58%), and Tunisia (56%).&lt;ref name=pewssp15/&gt; In Muslim regions of Southern-Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the support is less than 50%: Russia (42%), Kyrgyzstan (35%), Tajikistan (27%), Kosovo (20%), Albania (12%), Turkey (12%), Kazakhstan (10%), Azerbaijan (8%). Regarding specific averages, in South Asia, Sharia had 84% favorability rating among the respondents; in Southeast Asia 77%; in the Middle-East/North Africa 74%; in Sub-Saharan Africa 64%; in Southern-Eastern Europe 18%; and in Central Asia 12%.&lt;ref name=pewssp15/&gt;

However, while most of those who support implementation of sharia favor using it in family and property disputes, fewer supported application of severe punishments such as whippings and cutting off hands, and interpretations of some aspects differed widely.&lt;ref name=pewssp15&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Sandra |editor-last=Stence |year=2013 |others=Research: Alan Cooperman, Neha Sahgal, Jessica Hamar Martinez, et al. |title=The World's Muslims: Religion, Politics and Society |publisher=The Pew Forum on Religion &amp; Public Life |pages=15–19, 46, 147–48 |ref=harv |url=http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf |accessdate=31 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030223449/http://www.pewforum.org/files/2013/04/worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-full-report.pdf# |archive-date=2014-10-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Pew poll, among Muslims who support making sharia the law of the land, most do not believe that it should be applied to non-Muslims.
In the Muslim-majority countries surveyed this proportion varied between 74% (of 74% in Egypt) and 19% (of 10% in Kazakhstan), as percentage of those who favored making sharia the law of the land.{{sfn|Stence|2013|p=48}} Polls demonstrate that for Egyptians, the 'Shariah' is associated with notions of political, social and gender justice.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C.

In 2008, [[Rowan Williams]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, has suggested that Islamic and [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] courts should be integrated into the British legal system alongside ecclesiastical courts to handle marriage and divorce, subject to agreement of all parties and strict requirements for protection of equal rights for women.&lt;ref name="feldman"&gt;{{cite news |last=Feldman |first=Noah |title=Why Shariah? |date=Mar 16, 2008 |newspaper=New York Times Magazine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reference to the sharia sparked a controversy.&lt;ref name="feldman" /&gt; Later that year, [[Nicholas Phillips, Baron Phillips of Worth Matravers|Nicholas Phillips]], then [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales]], stated that there was "no reason why sharia principles [...] should not be the basis for mediation or other forms of alternative dispute resolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sharia law 'could have UK role' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7488790.stm |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=Sep 4, 2016 |date=4 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 YouGov poll in the United Kingdom found 40% of Muslim students interviewed supported the introduction of sharia into British law for Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/religion/2461830/Killing-for-religion-is-justified-say-third-of-Muslim-students.html Killing for religion is justified, say third of Muslim students] The Telegraph (July 26, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Broyde]], professor of law at [[Emory University]] specializing in [[alternative dispute resolution]] and [[Jewish law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.emory.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/faculty-profiles/broyde-profile.html |title=Michael J.

[[Islamic fundamentalism|Fundamentalists]], wishing to return to basic Islamic religious values and law, have in some instances imposed harsh sharia punishments for crimes, curtailed civil rights and violated human rights. Extremists have used the Quran and their own particular version of sharia to justify acts of war and terror against Muslim as well as non-Muslim individuals and governments, using alternate, conflicting interpretations of sharia and their notions of jihad.&lt;ref name=aenexeter/&gt;{{sfn|Horrie|Chippindale|1991|p=4}}{{sfn|Horrie|Chippindale|1991|p=100}}

The sharia basis of arguments advocating terrorism is controversial.

Pearson Prentice Hall. p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; and the terrorist practice of suicide bombing "has no justification in terms of Islamic theology, law or tradition".&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis (with Buntzie Ellis Churchill) 'Islam: The Religion and the People' (2008). Pearson Prentice Hall p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern era the notion of jihad has lost its jurisprudential relevance and instead gave rise to an ideological and political discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wael B.

According to Jan Michiel Otto, Professor of Law and Governance in Developing Countries at [[Leiden University]], "[a]nthropological research shows that people in local communities often do not distinguish clearly whether and to what extent their norms and practices are based on local tradition, tribal custom, or religion. Those who adhere to a confrontational view of sharia tend to ascribe many undesirable practices to sharia and religion overlooking custom and culture, even if high-ranking religious authorities have stated the opposite."{{sfn|Otto|2008|p=30}}

==Criticism==

===Compatibility with western democracy===
{{further information|Islamic ethics|Islam and democracy|Shura|Ijma}}
Ali Khan states that "constitutional orders founded on the principles of sharia are fully compatible with democracy, provided that religious minorities are protected and the incumbent Islamic leadership remains committed to the right to recall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Ali |last1=Khan |date=September 9, 2002 |title=Will the European Court of Human Rights Push Turkey Toward Islamic Revolution? |journal=Jurist |ssrn=941002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khan, L.

Courts in non-Muslim-majority nations have generally ruled against the implementation of sharia, both in jurisprudence and within a community context, based on sharia's religious background.

===Human rights===
Several major, predominantly Muslim countries have criticized the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) for its perceived failure to take into account the cultural and religious context of non-[[Western world|Western]] countries. Iran declared in the UN assembly that UDHR was "a [[Secularism|secular]] understanding of the [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Forsythe (2009), Encyclopedia of Human Rights: Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, pp. 239–45&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic scholars and Islamist political parties consider 'universal human rights' arguments as imposition of a non-Muslim culture on Muslim people, a disrespect of customary cultural practices and of Islam.&lt;ref name=as1999&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Amyn B |last1=Sajoo |date=Spring 1990 |title=Islam and Human Rights: Congruence or Dichotomy |journal=Temple International and Comparative Law Journal |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=23–34 |oclc=81814299}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kecia |last1=Ali |chapter=Progressive Muslims and Islamic jurisprudence: the necessity for critical engagement with marriage and divorce law |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MCcAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT189 |pages=163–87 |editor1-first=Omid |editor1-last=Safi |year=2003 |title=Progressive Muslims: On Justice, Gender, and Pluralism |publisher=Oneworld |isbn=978-1780740454}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]], a group representing all Muslim-majority nations, met in Cairo to respond to the UDHR, then adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Heiner |last1=Bielefeldt |title='Western' versus 'Islamic' Human Rights Conceptions?: A Critique of Cultural Essentialism in the Discussion on Human Rights |journal=Political Theory |volume=28 |issue=1 |year=2000 |pages=90–121 |jstor=192285 |doi=10.1177/0090591700028001005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anver M.

[[Ann Elizabeth Mayer]] points to notable absences from the Cairo Declaration: provisions for democratic principles, protection for religious freedom, freedom of association and freedom of the press, as well as equality in rights and equal protection under the law. Article 24 of the Cairo declaration states that "all the rights and freedoms stipulated in this Declaration are subject to the Islamic ''shari'a''".&lt;ref name=mayer&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ann Elizabeth |last1=Mayer |chapter=Islamic Law and Human Rights: Conundrums and Equivocations |editor1-first=Carrie |editor1-last=Gustafson |editor2-first=Peter H. |editor2-last=Juviler |year=2016 |title=Religion and Human Rights: Competing Claims?: Competing Claims? |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1315502557}}{{page needed|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the journal ''[[Free Inquiry]]'' summarized the criticism of the Cairo Declaration in an editorial: "We are deeply concerned with the changes to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] by a coalition of Islamic states within the [[United Nations]] that wishes to prohibit any criticism of religion and would thus protect Islam's limited view of human rights. In view of the conditions inside the Islamic Republic of Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the Sudan, Syria, Bangladesh, Iraq, and Afghanistan, we should expect that at the top of their human rights agenda would be to rectify the legal inequality of women, the suppression of political dissent, the curtailment of free expression, the persecution of ethnic minorities and religious dissenters&amp;nbsp;– in short, protecting their citizens from egregious human rights violations. Instead, they are worrying about protecting Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Kurtz, [[Austin Dacey]], and Tom Flynn. "Defaming Human Rights". ''[[Free Inquiry]]''. February/March 2009, Vol. 29, No. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[H. Patrick Glenn]] states that sharia is structured around the concept of mutual obligations of a collective, and it considers individual human rights as potentially disruptive and unnecessary to its revealed code of mutual obligations. In giving priority to this religious collective rather than individual liberty, the Islamic law justifies the formal inequality of individuals (women, non-Islamic people).&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, H. Patrick (2014), pp. 199–205&lt;/ref&gt; Bassam Tibi states that sharia framework and human rights are incompatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tibi |first1=Bassam |title=The Return of the Sacred to Politics as a Constitutional Law The Case of the Shari'atization of Politics in Islamic Civilization |journal=Theoria |volume=55 |issue=115 |pages=91–119 |year=2008 |jstor=41802396 |doi=10.3167/th.2008.5511506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdel al-Hakeem Carney, in contrast, states that sharia is misunderstood from a failure to distinguish ''sharia'' from ''siyasah'' (politics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Carney |first1=ABD Al-Hakeem |title=The Desacralisation of Power in Islam |journal=Religion, State and Society |volume=31 |issue=2 |year=2003 |pages=203–19 |doi=10.1080/09637490308281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United Nations' [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], every human has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change their religion or belief. Sharia has been criticized for not recognizing this human right.

* If a person converts to Islam, or is born and raised as a Muslim, then he or she will have full rights of citizenship in an Islamic state.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;
* Leaving Islam is a sin and a religious crime. Once any man or woman is officially classified as Muslim, because of birth or religious conversion, he or she will be subject to the death penalty if he or she becomes an [[Apostasy in Islam|apostate]], that is, abandons his or her faith in Islam in order to become an atheist, agnostic or to convert to another religion. Before executing the death penalty, sharia demands that the individual be offered one chance to return to Islam.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;
* If a person has never been a Muslim, and is not a [[kafir]] (infidel, unbeliever), he or she can live in an Islamic state by accepting to be a [[dhimmi]], or under a special permission called ''aman''. As a dhimmi or under aman, he or she will suffer certain limitations of rights as a subject of an Islamic state, and will not enjoy complete legal equality with Muslims.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;
* If a person has never been a Muslim, and is a kafir (infidel, unbeliever), sharia demands that he or she should be offered the choice to convert to Islam and become a Muslim; if he or she rejects the offer, he or she may become a dhimmi. Failure to pay the tax may lead the non-Muslim to either be enslaved, killed or ransomed if captured.&lt;ref name=naim96/&gt;

{{main article|Women in Islam|Islam and domestic violence}}

====Domestic violence====
Many claim sharia law encourages domestic violence against women, when a husband suspects ''[[nushuz]]'' (disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion, ill conduct) in his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Farid |last1=Esack |chapter=Islam and Gender Justice: Beyond Simplistic Apologia |chapterurl={{Google books|riz_cIdSq0gC |page=187 |plainurl=yes}} |pages=187–210 |editor1-first=John C. |editor1-last=Raines |editor2-first=Daniel C. |editor2-last=Maguire |year=2014 |title=What Men Owe to Women: Men's Voices from World Religions |publisher=SUNY |isbn=978-0791491553 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars claim wife beating, for ''nashizah'', is not consistent with modern perspectives of the Quran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hamid R. |last1=Kusha |chapter=Qur'anic Perspectives on Wife Abuse |pages=595–602 |editor1-first=Nicky Ali |editor1-last=Jackson |year=2007 |title=Encyclopedia of Domestic Violence |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0415969680}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the verses of the Quran relating to permissibility of domestic violence is [[An-Nisa, 34|Surah 4:34]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alim.org/library/quran/ayah/compare/4/34/men-are-given-authority-over-women-and-corrective-measures-for-disobedient-women-and-arbitration-in-family-disputes |title=Surah 4:34 (An-Nisaa), Alim&amp;nbsp;– Translated by Mohammad Asad, Gibraltar (1980) |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/RobertSchumanCentre/Research/InternationalTransnationalRelations/MediterraneanProgramme/MRM/MRM2011/ws04.aspx Salhi and Grami (2011), Gender and Violence in the Middle East and North Africa, Florence (Italy), European University Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927154118/http://www.eui.eu/DepartmentsAndCentres/RobertSchumanCentre/Research/InternationalTransnationalRelations/MediterraneanProgramme/MRM/MRM2011/ws04.aspx |date=September 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharia has been criticized for ignoring women's rights in domestic abuse cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mathias |last1=Rohe |chapter=Shari'a in a European Context |chapterurl={{Google books|bY1sReuxDy0C |page=93 |plainurl=yes}} |pages=93–114 |editor1-first=Ralpho |editor1-last=Grillo |editor2-first=Roger |editor2-last=Ballard |editor3-first=Alessandro |editor3-last=Ferrari |editor4-first=André J. |editor4-last=Hoekema |editor5-first=Marcel |editor5-last=Maussen |editor6-first=Prakash |editor6-last=Shah |year=2009 |title=Legal Practice and Cultural Diversity |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0754675471 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Funder |first1=Anna |title=''De Minimis Non Curat Lex'': The Clitoris, Culture and the Law |journal=Transnational Law &amp; Contemporary Problems |volume=3 |issue=2 |year=1993 |pages=417–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Zainah |last1=Anwar |chapter=Law-Making in the Name of Islam: Implications for Democratic Governance |chapterurl={{Google books|6Js6QXUbmjYC |page=121 |plainurl=yes}} |pages=121–34 |editor1-first=K S |editor1-last=Nathan |editor2-first=Mohammad Hashim |editor2-last=Kamali |year=2005 |title=Islam in Southeast Asia: Political, Social and Strategic Challenges for the 21st Century |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies |isbn=978-9812302830 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bakht |first1=Natasha |title=Family Arbitration Using Sharia Law: Examining Ontario's Arbitration Act and its Impact on Women |journal=Muslim World Journal of Human Rights |volume=1 |issue=1 |year=2007 |ssrn=1121953 |doi=10.2202/1554-4419.1022}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musawah]], [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women|CEDAW]], KAFA and other organizations have proposed ways to modify sharia-inspired laws to improve women's rights in Muslim-majority nations, including women's rights in domestic abuse cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.musawah.org/cedaw-and-muslim-family-laws-search-common-ground |title=CEDAW and Muslim Family Laws: In Search of Common Ground |year=2012 |publisher=[[Musawah]]}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brandt |first1=Michele |last2=Kaplan |first2=Jeffrey A. |title=The Tension between Women's Rights and Religious Rights: Reservations to Cedaw by Egypt, Bangladesh and Tunisia |journal=Journal of Law and Religion |volume=12 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=105–42 |jstor=1051612 |doi=10.2307/1051612}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/86247/lebanon-move-to-take-domestic-violence-cases-out-of-religious-courts |title=Lebanon – IRIN, United Nations Office of Humanitarian Affairs (2009) |work=IRINnews|date=2009-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/10/19/uae-spousal-abuse-never-right |title=UAE: Spousal Abuse never a Right |date=October 19, 2010 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Personal status laws and child marriage====
Shari'a is the basis for personal status laws in most Islamic-majority nations. These personal status laws determine [[women's rights|rights of women]] in matters of marriage, divorce and child custody. A 2011 [[UNICEF]] report concludes that sharia law provisions are discriminatory against women from a human rights perspective. In legal proceedings under sharia law, a woman’s testimony is worth half of a man’s before a court.&lt;ref name=unicef2011&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/gender/files/REGIONAL-Gender-Eqaulity-Profile-2011.pdf |title=MENA Gender Equality Profile – Status of Girls and Women in the Middle East and North Africa, UNICEF (October 2011) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for Iran{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, Lebanon{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} and Bahrain{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} which allow child marriages{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}, the civil codes in Islamic majority countries do not allow [[child marriage]] of girls. However, with sharia personal status laws, sharia courts in all these nations have the power to override the civil code. The religious courts permit girls less than 18 years old to marry. As of 2011, child marriages are common in a few Middle Eastern countries, accounting for 1 in 6 of all marriages in Egypt and 1 in 3 marriages in Yemen. [[UNICEF]] and other studies state that the top five nations in the world with highest observed child marriage rates – Niger (75%), Chad (72%), Mali (71%), Bangladesh (64%), Guinea (63%) – are Islamic-majority countries where the personal laws for Muslims are sharia-based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/sowc09/docs/SOWC09-CountryExample-Mali.pdf |format=PDF |title=Child Marriage is a Death Sentence for Many Young Girls |publisher=UNICEF |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nour |first=Nawal M. |title=Health Consequences of Child Marriage in Africa |journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases |volume=12 |issue=11 |pages=1644–49 |year=2006 |pmid=17283612 |doi=10.3201/eid1211.060510 |pmc=3372345}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his [[Cairo speech]], President Obama spoke out against child marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|id=B0lwiInZG1E#t=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rape is considered a crime in all countries, but sharia courts in Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Libya, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia in some cases allow a rapist to escape punishment by marrying his victim, while in other cases the victim who complains is often prosecuted with the crime of ''[[Zina]]'' (adultery).&lt;ref name=unicef2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/challenges_to_women_security_mena_region.pdf |title=Kendra Heideman and Mona Youssef, Challenges to Women's Security in the MENA Region, Wilson Center (March, 2013) |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2016-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/article/new-survey-assesses-womens-freedom-middle-east |title=Sanja Kelly (2010) New Survey Assesses Women's Freedom in the Middle East, Freedom House (funded by US Department of State's Middle East Partnership Initiative) |publisher=|date=2005-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Women's right to property and consent====
Sharia grants women the [[right to property|right to inherit property]] from other family members, and these rights are detailed in the Quran.{{sfn|Horrie|Chippindale|1991|p=49}} A woman's inheritance is unequal and less than a man's, and dependent on many factors.{{Quran-usc|4|12}}&lt;ref name=davidpowers/&gt; For instance, a daughter's inheritance is usually half that of her brother's.{{Quran-usc|4|11}}&lt;ref name=davidpowers&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Powers |first1=David S. |title=The Islamic Inheritance System: a Socio-Historical Approach |journal=Arab Law Quarterly |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=1993 |pages=13–29 |jstor=3381490 |doi=10.1163/157302593X00285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 20th century, Islamic law granted Muslim women certain legal rights, such as the right to own property received as [[Mahr]] (brideprice) at her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Badawi |first=Jamal A. |title=The Status of Women in Islam |journal=Al-Ittihad Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=8 |issue=2 |date=September 1971}}{{page needed|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feldman&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Noah Feldman |last=Feldman |first=Noah |title=Why Shariah? |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 16, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/magazine/16Shariah-t.html?ei=5070&amp;em=&amp;en=5c1b8de536ce606f&amp;ex=1205812800&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Islamic law does not grant non-Muslim women the same legal rights as the few it did grant Muslim women. Sharia recognizes the basic inequality between master and women slave, between free women and slave women, between Believers and non-Believers, as well as their unequal rights.&lt;ref name=blbr&gt;

Starting with the 20th century, Western legal systems evolved to expand women's rights, but women's rights under Islamic law have remained tied to the Quran, hadiths and their fundamentalist interpretation as sharia by Islamic jurists.&lt;ref name=alik/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Hafez, Mohammed |title=Why Muslims Rebel |journal=Al-Ittihad Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=September 2006 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parallels with Western legal systems==

Early Islamic law developed a number of legal concepts that anticipated similar such concepts that later appeared in English [[common law]].&lt;ref name=Makdisi&gt;{{Citation|last=Makdisi|first=John A.|title=The Islamic Origins of the Common Law|journal=[[North Carolina Law Review]]|year=1999|date=June 1999|volume=77|issue=5|pages=1635–1739}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Devichand&gt;{{Cite news|author=Mukul Devichand|title=Is English law related to Muslim law?|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/7631388.stm|accessdate=2008-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarities exist between the royal English [[contract]] protected by the action of [[debt]] and the Islamic ''Aqd'', between the English [[assize of novel disseisin]] and the Islamic ''Istihqaq'', and between the English [[jury]] and the Islamic ''Lafif'' in classical Maliki jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Jamila|last=Hussain|title=Book Review: ''The Justice of Islam'' by Lawrence Rosen|journal=[[Melbourne University Law Review]]|volume=30|year=2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[law school]]s known as [[Inns of Court]] also parallel [[Madrasah]]s.&lt;ref name=Makdisi/&gt; The methodology of legal [[precedent]] and reasoning by [[analogy]] (''[[Qiyas]]'') are also similar in both the Islamic and common law systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Islamic Finance: Law, Economics, and Practice|first=Mahmoud A.|last=El-Gamal|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0521864145|page=16|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; as are the English [[Trust law|trust]] and [[Agency (law)|agency]] institutions to the Islamic ''[[Waqf]]'' and ''[[Hawala]]'' institutions, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gaudiosi |first=Monica M. |title=The Influence of the Islamic Law of Waqf on the Development of the Trust in England: The Case of Merton College |journal=[[University of Pennsylvania Law Review]] |volume=136 |issue=4 |date=April 1988 |pages=1231–1261 |doi=10.2307/3312162 |jstor=3312162 |ref=harv|url=http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/penn_law_review/vol136/iss4/6 |type=Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Islamic Law: Its Relation to Other Legal Systems|first=Gamal Moursi|last=Badr|journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law|volume=26|issue=2 – Proceedings of an International Conference on Comparative Law, Salt Lake City, Utah, February 24–25, 1977|date=Spring 1978|pages=187–198 [196–8]|doi=10.2307/839667|jstor=839667|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Devichand/&gt;

Elements of Islamic law also have other parallels in Western legal systems. For example, the influence of Islam on the development of an international law of the sea can be discerned alongside that of the Roman influence.&lt;ref name=Tai&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tai |first1=Emily Sohmer |title=Book Reviews: Hassan S. Khalilieh, ''Admiralty and Maritime Laws in the Mediterranean Sea (ca. 800–1050): The "Kitāb Akriyat al-Sufun" vis-à-vis the "Nomos Rhodion Nautikos"'' |journal=Medieval Encounters |volume=13 |issue=3 |year=2007 |pages=608–12 |doi=10.1163/157006707X222812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Makdisi states Islamic law also parallels the legal scholastic system in the West, which gave rise to the modern university system.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi/&gt; He writes that the triple status of ''[[faqih]]'' ("[[Master of Laws|master of law]]"), ''[[mufti]]'' ("professor of [[Fatwā|legal opinions]]") and ''mudarris'' ("teacher"), conferred by the classical Islamic legal degree, had its equivalents in the medieval Latin terms ''[[Magister (degree)|magister]]'', ''[[professor]]'' and ''[[Doctor (title)|doctor]]'', respectively, although they all came to be used synonymously in both East and West.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Makdisi |first1=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |year=1989 |pages=175–82 |jstor=604423 |doi=10.2307/604423}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makdisi suggests that the medieval European doctorate, ''licentia docendi'' was modeled on the Islamic degree ''ijazat al-tadris wa-l-ifta’'', of which it is a word-for-word translation, with the term ''ifta’'' (issuing of fatwas) omitted.&lt;ref name=G-Makdisi/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Devin J. |last=Stewart |title=Degrees, or Ijaza |editor=Josef W.

There are differences between Islamic and Western legal systems. For example, sharia classically recognizes only [[natural persons]], and never developed the concept of a [[legal person]], or [[corporation]], i.e., a legal entity that [[Limited liability|limits the liabilities]] of its managers, shareholders, and employees; exists beyond the lifetimes of its founders; and that can own assets, sign contracts, and appear in court through representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Timur |last1=Kuran |authorlink1=Timur Kuran |date=Fall 2005 |title=The Absence of the Corporation in Islamic Law: Origins and Persistence |journal=The American Journal of Comparative Law |volume=53 |issue=4 |pages=785–834 |jstor=30038724}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interest prohibitions imposed secondary costs by discouraging record keeping and delaying the introduction of modern accounting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kuran |first1=Timur |title=The logic of financial westernization in the Middle East |journal=Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization |volume=56 |issue=4 |year=2005 |pages=593–615 |doi=10.1016/j.jebo.2004.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors, according to Timur Kuran, have played a significant role in retarding economic development in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0895330042162421 "Why the Middle East Is Economically Underdeveloped&amp;nbsp;– Historical Mechanisms of Institutional Stagnation"].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Start Making A Reader Today''' (SMART) is a [[non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[Volunteering|volunteer]]-driven tutoring program local to [[Oregon]] for at-risk K-3 readers. SMART was developed by [[Neil Goldschmidt]] in 1992.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Baker, Scott, Russell Gersten and Thomas Keating. ''[http://getsmartoregon.org/ourmission/documents/Reading%20Research%20Quarterly%20Dec%20%2700.pdf When less may be more: A 2-year longitudinal evaluation of a volunteer tutoring program requiring minimal training]''. Reading Research Quarterly, Volume 35, Number 4; Oct-Dec. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; It has grown from serving 585 children at 8 schools at its inception&lt;ref name="programOverview"&gt;{{cite web|title=Program Overview|publisher=SMART|url=http://getsmartoregon.org/ourmission/documents/Program%20Overview.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to serving 7,244 children at 204 sites in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://getsmartoregon.org/aboutus/documents/SMART%20Annual%20Report%20FY09.pdf Smart Annual Report 2008-2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and 223 sites in 2011.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"/&gt;  As of December 2011, the organization's annual budget was $2.7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"&gt;{{cite news|last=Row|first=D.K.|title=Getting SMART about success|date=December 16, 2011&lt;!--(online date Dec. 15)--&gt;|newspaper=[[The Oregonian]]|page=E1|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/living/index.ssf/2011/12/getting_smart_about_success.html |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program concept involves each student getting one-on-one attention twice a week for 30 minutes as they read to a volunteer to help boost their confidence in their reading ability. Additionally, the students get to take two books home each month over the seven months the program runs each year (mid-October to mid-May), in order to make more reading material available at home.&lt;ref name="oregonian-dec2011"/&gt;

The program's effectiveness is backed by a [[Longitudinal study|two-year study]] performed at the Eugene Research Institute which indicates SMART students outperform similar students in word identification and word comprehension by nearly a half [[standard deviation]].&lt;ref name="study"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://evidencebasedprograms.org/wordpress/?page_id=85 Social Programs That Work: SMART]&lt;/ref&gt;

SMART aims to partner foremost with schools that have a high percentage of children from [[Poverty|low-income]] families. School staff interviews, community support, and information from the [[Oregon Department of Education]] also influence school selection.&lt;ref name="programOverview"/&gt;

In 2010, SMART participated in [[Pepsi]]'s Refresh Challenge and running for the $250,000 prize.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refresheverything.com/smartreading Pepsi Refresh Challenge: SMART]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9028">''Die Sechzehn Grundsätze des Städtebaus'', or ''The Sixteen Principles of Urban Design'', were from 1950 until 1955 the primary model for urban planning in the [[GDR]].

==Text==
''Decided by the Government of the German Democratic Republic on 27 July 1950:

''The urban planning and architectural design of our cities, which shall influence the construction of all of Germany, must express the social order of the German Democratic Republic, as well as the progressive traditions and great goals of our German people. They shall adhere to the following principles:

#''The city as a form of settlement did not arise by chance. The city is the richest economic and cultural form of community settlement, proven by centuries of experience. The city is in its structural and architectural design an expression of the political life and the national consciousness of the people.
#''The goal of urban planning is the harmonious fulfillments of man's basic rights to employment, housing, culture and recreation. The methodological principles of urban planning are based on the natural condition, on the social and economic foundations of the state, on the highest achievements of science, technology and art, on the needs of the economy, and on the use of progressive elements of the cultural heritage of the people.
#''Cities, per se, do not arise and do not exist. To a significant extent, cities are built by industry for industry. The growth of the city, the population, and the area are determined by city-forming factors, that is, from industry, governing bodies, and cultural sites, insofar as they have more than local significance. In the capital, industry as an urbanization factor is of secondary importance to administrative bodies and cultural sites. The precise discernment and codification of city-forming factors is a matter determined by government.
#''The growth of the city must be subordinate to efficacy and remain within certain limits. An overgrown city, its population, and its area lead to difficulties in eliminating tangles in their structure, lead to entanglements in the organization of cultural life and the daily care of the population, and lead to administrative complications, both in business and in the development of industry.
#''Urban planning must be based on the principles of organicism, and the consideration of a city's historical structure in eliminating that city's shortcomings.
#''The center forms the veritable core of the city. The center of the city is the political center for its population. In the city center are the most important political, administrative and cultural sites. On the squares in the city center one might find political demonstrations, marches and popular celebrations held on festival days. The center of the city shall be composed of the most important and monumental buildings, dominating the architectural composition of the city plan and determining the architectural silhouette of the city.
#''In cities that lie on a river, the river and its embankments shall be one of the main arteries and architectural axes of the city.
#''Traffic circulation has to serve the city and its population. It should neither divide the city nor be cumbersome to the general public. Through traffic should be removed from the center and central district and rerouted outside its borders or to an outer ring. Equipment for the carriage of goods, such as rail- and canal-ways, should also be kept away from the central district of the city. Determining locations for main roads must take into account the coherence and tranquility of residential districts. In determining the width of main roads, it is important to note that the width of these main thoroughfares is not of crucial importance to urban transportation, but rather as an outlet for crossroads in order to appropriately ease the demands of traffic flow.
#''The visage of the city-that is, its individual artistic form-shall be defined by squares, main streets, and prominent buildings in the center of the city (in those largest cities containing skyscrapers). Squares and plazas shall serve as the structural basis for the planning of the city and for its overall architectural composition.
#''Residential areas shall consist of housing districts, the cores of which shall be district centers. For the sake of the residents of these housing districts, in them shall be all necessary cultural, utility, and social services. The second aspect in the structuring of residential areas shall be the residential complex, which is formed by grouping together four housing structures, where there shall be located a central park, schools, kindergartens, and nurseries that serve the daily needs of the population. Urban transport must not be allowed within these residential areas, but neither the residential districts nor the residential complexes should be isolated entities in and of themselves. Latent in their structure and design are the demands of the city on a whole. The housing structures themselves function as a third aspect in the importance of complexes in planning and design.
#''Access to light and air are not the only determining factors for healthy and peaceful living conditions, but also population density and orientations, as well as the development of transportation systems.
#''It is impossible to transform a city into a garden. Of course, care must be taken to provide sufficient greenery, but the principle not to overturn is that in the city one lives urbanistically, whereas on the outskirts or outside the city one lives rurally.
#''The many storey high-rise is more economical than a one- or two-storey design. It also reflects the character of the metropolis.
#''Urban planning is the basis of architectural design. Central to urban planning and architectural design of a city is the creation of an individual and unique visage for that city. The architecture must embody both the progressive traditions as well as the past experiences of the people.
#''For urban planning, as for architectural design, there shall be no abstract scheme. Crucial are only the summarization of essential architectural factors and the demands of daily life.
#''Simultaneously and in accordance with the work on a city plan shall be completed designs for the planning and development of specific neighborhoods, as well as plazas and main street with neatly organized housing blocks, whose construction will be completed first.''

==Implementation==
By September 7, 1950, one day after the adoption of a national building law, the demolition of the heavily damaged Berlin City Palace began. The plan was to build a 90-meter wide stretch of road from the Frankfurter Straße via [[Alexanderplatz]], Königstraße (now Rathausstraße) and the street [[Unter den Linden]] to the [[Brandenburg Gate]]. The "central axis" was to create a new representation Magistrale arise between the Brandenburg Gate and Alexanderplatz, the center of the monumental height dominant - should be in place of the castle, the central government building - as a "city crown" the Marx-Engels-Platz. In 1951, [[Stalinallee]] emerged as the first Socialist avenue in the GDR. The first stages of construction was from 1952 to 1958, designed by [[Hermann Henselmann]], architect of [[Hochhaus an der Weberwiese]]. When the work at [[Frankfurter Tor]] was completed in 1960, the historicist style of the avenue was already outdated and perceived almost bashfully. Other major projects were in [[Dresden]] at the Altmarkt, in [[Leipzig]] on Roßplatz and at the Long Street realized in [[Rostock]]. 
From 1955 a new phase of urban development in the GDR took place after the [[Soviet Union]] adopted new directives for 1954 architecture, which called for greater standardization and the waiving of expensive ornamentation. The second phase of Stalinallee-between Strausberger Platz and [[Alexander Platz]]-was therefore built in an industrial aesthetic.

The '''Vijayanagara musicological nonet''' or the '''''Sangitashastra navaratna''''' are a group of nine musicological treatises written during the reign of the [[Vijayanagara empire]].  These works are counted among the most important and definitive treatises in [[Carnatic music]] theory.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Each of these works contributed seminally to the growth of the [[Carnatic music]] tradition.  These nine works are the ''Sangitasara'' by the sage [[Vidyaranya]], ''Taladipika'' by Salva Gopa Tippendra, ''Sangitakalanidhi'' by Kallinatha, Bhandaru Vittaleshwara's commentary on the ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]'', Bhandaru Lakshminarayana's ''Sangitasuryodaya'', Achyutadevaraya's ''Talakalabdhi/Talakalavriddhi'' and the much celebrated ''[[Swaramelakalanidhi]]'' by Ramamatya.

==Historical milieu==
The reign of [[Vijayanagara empire]] was a watershed period in the cultural history of South India, particularly the history of Carnatic music.  The period witnessed the prolific contributions of numerous musicians, saints and theoreticians.  By virtue of the geo-political influence it exerted, Vijayanagara had become the confluence of many religions, art forms and cultures.  Society and culture went through a process of conflict and eclectic assimilation of the traditional and elite values on the one hand and the emerging folk and foreign influences on the other.  There was a strong interaction between traditional and elite values on the one hand and folk and foreign influences on the other.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Much of this was also the result of a reaction and revolt against emerging sociological and aesthetic trends.  Even as this assimilation and nativization of the contending or opposing influences took place, traditional purity and historical continuity continued to be preserved.  These cultural trends and objectives were later sustained and fostered in the several feudatory states that continued to thrive beyond the fall of the Vijayanagar empire.  Some of the notable states included Anegundi, Penukonda, Tanjore, [[Mysore Kingdom]], Madurai, [[Keladi Nayaka|Ikkeri]] etc.,.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==Innovations in theory and practice==
A wide range of experiments and innovations were carried out in the field of instruments too.  The [[Tanpura (instrument)|Tamburi]] introduced during the period soon became the principal drone instrument.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} Seminal work and innovations also took place in the Vina keyboards with regard to the accordatura, tonal range and instrumental parameters. The ''mela'' replaced the ''grama'' and it's the theoretical possibilities were fully explored through mathematical schemes of tabulation.  The innovation of the concept of ''mela'' and organization of the entirety of contemporary melodic material under its umbrella culminated in Venkatamakhin's ''Melakarta'' scheme, one which continues to influence greatly the theory and practice of Carnatic music to this day.  New classificatory models emerged for ragas; &lt;!--through psychoacoustical principles of temperament.--&gt; ''svayambhusvara'' (upper partials), ''paryaya-svara'' (alternative svara denomination) and ''pratinidhi-svara'' (representative note) scales and intervals were tuned to be brought into alignment with contemporary musical practice.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Various melodic and rhythmic structures found their way art music.  All music became ''desi'' and ''marga'' music passed into oblivion as did the ''madhyamagrama'' and its paraphernalia. The totality of melody came to be referred to ''sadja grama'' alone. The arbitrary, archaic and prolific ''desi talas'' made way for the suladi talas engendered by the [[Haridasa]]s.  These were further refined based on the principles of the ten vital elements called ''taladasaprana''.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} &lt;!--Theoretical and pedagogical scalar standards, as well as propaedeutic exercises (''abhyasagana'') which are relevant even today, were the contributions of  Vijayanagara.--&gt;

==Prominent composers==
At the height of the Vijayanagara empire great saint-composers like [[Purandara Dasa]], [[Sripadaraya]], [[Vyasatirtha|Vyasaraya]], [[Vadirajatirtha]], [[Kanaka Dasa]], Tallapakam [[Annamacharya]] and his descendants, and Nijagunashivayogi flourished. Musical forms, the ''Kriti'', the ''Suladi'', the ''Ugabhoga'', the ''Dandaka'', the ''Urttanama'', the ''Namavali'', the ''Mundige'', the ''Gita'', the ''Thaya'' and the ''Prabandha'' developed and found wide currency during this period.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==The 'nonet'==
Throughout the Vijayanagara period, theory and musical practice kept pace with each other closely. Great musicologists like Vidyaranya, Salva Gopa Tippendra, Kallinatha, Kumbhakarna, Ramamatya, Laksmanarayana, Pandarika Vittala, Somanatha, Locana Jha and Hrdayanarayanadeva contributed to musical theory of both North and South India during this period.  Tanappacharya, [[Govinda Dikshita]] and Venkatamakhin made foundational contributions from Tanjore about a century later. Each work of these scholars records a revolutionary and seminal concept or development which cumulatively resulted in modern Carnatic music.  Nine musicological treatises of great significance were composed in the Vijayanagar period and these have been called the Vijayanagara ''Sangitashastra Navaratna'' or the 'Vijayanagara Musicological Nonet'.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Sangitasara
The first of the ''navaratnas'' is Vidyaranya's ''Sangitasara'', composed in the second half of the fourteenth century.  The work dealt with, among other things, the fifteen ''melas'' and their fifty ''janya ragas'' as well as certain types of singers.  Some of this even found its way into Govinda Dikshita's ''Sangitasudha'' (''nidhi''), authored in the early seventeenth century.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Taladipika
The second of the nonet (chronologically) is the ''Taladipika''.  Authored in the mid-fifteenth century by Salva Gopa-Tippendra, brother-in-law of king [[Deva Raya II|Praudha Devaraya II]] and a viceroy of [[Kolar district|Mulbagal]], the work deals at great length with the [[Tala (music)|tala]]. It describes over a hundred desi talas including some of the author's own inventions.  Most importantly, the concept of ''taladasaprana'' (ten vital elements of tala) is elucidated  for the first time in the work. This innovation was to prove so influential that, following its explication, all temporal activities in music and dance came to be organized and consolidated under these elements.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Sangitakalanidhi
To the same period belongs the third work of the Nonet, Kallinatha's''Sangitakalanidhi'', a versatile commentary on [[Sarangadeva|Sharngadeva]]'s ''[[Sangita Ratnakara]]'', the encyclopedic magnum opus on Indian music.  It was about dancing and aesthetics of the thirteenth century. In the work, Kallinatha meticulously annotated, explicated, criticised and emphasised all the central issues of the ''Ratnakara''; he also illumined it through comparison with contemporary practices, theories and norms of music and dance. He anticipated many developments in these arts.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Bhandaru Vittaleshwara's commentary
A Telugu commentary by Bhandaru (-ri?) Vittaleshwara on the ''Sangitaratnakara'' in the last quarter of the fifteenth century forms the fourth of the ''navaratnas''.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}
 
;Sangitasuryodaya
In 1525, Vittaleshwara's son Bhandaru (ri?) Lakshminarayana composed the fifth treatise, the ''Sangitasuryodaya'', under the patronage of king [[Krishnadevaraya]] of Vijayanagara.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Talakalabdhi/Talakalavriddhi
In the generation that immediately followed, Achyutadevaraya's ''Talakalabdhi''/''Talakalavridhi'' was written.  This was an important treatise on ''tala''. This work organizes for the first time the theory and practice of the ''suladi talas'' of the Haridasas in terms of the ''dasapranas''. In the work, he also compiles views from several earlier works on ''tala'' such as Talakalavilasa, Sangitavidyavinoda, Jainamata, Sangitamarga, Chaturasabhavilasa, Sangitachudamani, Anjaneyamata, Nrttachudamani, Sangitamanidarpana, Katyayaniya, Sangitarnava, Rangaraja Bharatabhashya, Kapardi, and Parameshvara (all of them non-extant), and refutes them. 
Further, Achyutaraya applies all the five ''laghu-jatis'' to each ''suladi tala'' and thereby expands the scope and function of the ''suladi talas''.  Around the same time, Ashtavadana Somabhatta composed the ''Svararagasudharasa'' or ''Natyachudamani'' under the guidance of his guru Sitarama and probably under Achyutaraya's patronage. This work is now available only in fragments.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

;Swaramelakalanidhi
The final 'gem' in the series is the much celebrated ''[[Svaramelakalanidhi]]'' authored by the illustrious Kallinatha's grandson, Ramamatya ca. 1550.  Ramamatya was the royal composer and architect in the court of de facto king [[Aliya Rama Raya]].&lt;ref name="kall"&gt;Moorthy (2001), p 27&lt;/ref&gt; He described himself as ''abhinavabharatacharya'' and ''todara-malla'' (meaning "the hero(malla) who wears the honorific anklet(''todar'')). The last epithet however, is usually interpreted by scholars as alluding to the Todarmal, a minister in Akbar's court, the anachronism notwithstanding.  The Kannada term, in fact translates to 'the hero (malla) who wears the honorific anklet (todar)'.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

''Svaramelakalanidhi'' importance lies in the fact that it is more relevant and related to modern practice than the books written prior to it.  The work, spread over five chapters deals primarily with ''Raga'' and preliminary to it, describes the ''Mela-s'' for the classification of ''Raga'' - and the different ''Suddha svara-s'' and ''Vikrta svara-s'' constituting the ''Mela-s''. Similar works by other celebrated contemporaries like Pandarika Vitthala and Somanatha project a common theme, namely the description of ''Ragas'', classification under ''Melas'' and the enumeration of the ''Suddha'' and ''Vikrta svaras'' constituting the ''Melas''.  Minor ideological differences can however be discerned among these works.&lt;ref name="nram"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicresearch.in/categorydetails.php?imgid=7 |title=Svaramelakalanidhi of Ramamatya |author=N Ramanathan |accessdate=2008-02-21 |publisher=[MusicResearch.in]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Svaramelakalanidhi'' brings the theory up to date, rationalizes intervals and scales, introduces the concepts of ''svayambhu-svara'' (self-generating note, upper partial), ''.dharashruti paryayatattva'' and ''pratinidhitattva'' of ''svaras''.  ''Mukhari'' is established as the ''shuddhasvara saptaka''.  It also fixes and standardizes musical intervals on the keyboard, defines the accordatura, range, preferred strings (for particular notes) etc., for a variety of stringed keyboards.  It also innovates and dedicates a new keyboard to Achyutaraya.  A new scheme for classifying ragas into ''uttama'' (superior), ''madhyama'' (middling) and ''adhama'' (inferior) on the basis of their expressive potential is also expounded in the work.  It also resolves the problem of the ''antara'' and ''kaishiki'' notes.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}}

==History==
[[File:TheFaulknerPortable.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A copy of the 1939 edition of [[Novel &amp; Short Story Writer's Market|''Writer's Market'']], published by Writer's Digest Books rests next to [[William Faulkner|William Faulkner's]] [[Underwood Typewriter Company|Underwood]] Universal Portable typewriter in his office at his home, [[Rowan Oak]], which is now maintained by the [[University of Mississippi]] in [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]] as a museum.]]

''Writer's Digest'' was established in 1920 under the name ''Successful Writing'', first issue, December. It changed name to ''Writer's Digest'' with the March 1921 issue. By the late 1920s, it shifted emphasis more from literary-quality writing to the rapidly growing [[pulp magazine]] field, which offered the widest opportunities to freelance writers. An important feature from 1933 forward was the New York Market Letter, edited by [[Harriet Bradfield]], which gave timely updates on editor needs in the magazine field. As the pulp field collapsed in the 1950s, ''Writer's Digest'' shifted emphasis to famous writers and quality fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Locke, John; editor.
