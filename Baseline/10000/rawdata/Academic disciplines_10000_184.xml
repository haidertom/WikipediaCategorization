Research institute '''AMOLF''' is part of the institutes organization of [[Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research]] (NWO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwo.nl/en|title=Welcome to NWO|website=www.nwo.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. AMOLF carries out fundamental research on the physics and design principles of natural and man-made complex matter. AMOLF uses these insights to create novel functional materials and find new solutions to societal challenges in renewable energy, green ICT and healthcare. AMOLF is located at the [[Amsterdam Science Park]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl/|title=Amsterdam Science Park Science and Business {{!}} Amsterdam Science Park|website=www.amsterdamsciencepark.nl|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

AMOLF used to be part of the Dutch Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter (FOM). On 31 December, 2016 FOM integrated in NWO &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nwo-i.nl/en/nwo-institutes-organisation/nwo-transition/|title=NWO Transition - NWO-I|work=NWO-I|access-date=2018-10-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==

The institute was established in 1949 by the government as the FOM Laboratory for Mass Spectrography. In 1960, it was renamed to Laboratory for Mass Separation, and in 1966 it was reorganized into a research institute and renamed FOM Institute for Atomic and Molecular Physics (AMOLF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://amolf.nl/about/history-of-amolf|title=History of AMOLF|publisher=AMOLF|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original research goal was to demonstrate the separation of uranium isotopes by electromagnetic separation methods, a topic of great strategic importance after World War II. To reach this goal, a number of novelanalytical instrumentation were developed, starting with the development of mass-spectrometric tools. In 1953 AMOLF was the first European institute to successfully enrich Uranium. Soon after, research on thermal diffusion in gases followed, as did [[ultracentrifuge]] concepts, cathode dispersion, excitation of gases by using energetic ions and research on molecular beams. The gas-[[ultracentrifuge]] developed at AMOLF (under [[:nl:Jacob_Kistemaker|Jacob Kistemaker]]) provided a base for the commercial enrichment of Uranium at the today well-known company of [[URENCO]] in [[Almelo]].

==Structure and organization ==

AMOLF functions as an incubator for Dutch science, both in terms of launching new research themes and in terms of training talented scientists. AMOLF is headed by its director [[Huib Bakker]], who succeeded [[:nl:Vinod_Subramaniam|Vinod Subramaniam]] on 1 February, 2016. The organization has 19 research groups headed by tenured or tenure-track group leaders. AMOLF employs about 130 researchers and 70 employees for technical and administrative support.

==Research==

AMOLF’s research program consists of four intertwined themes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://amolf.nl/research|title=Research - AMOLF|work=AMOLF|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1421">In [[mycology]] a [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] or feature is said to be '''amyloid''' if it has a positive '''amyloid reaction''' when subjected to a crude chemical test using [[iodine]] in either [[Melzer's reagent]] or [[Lugol's solution]], producing a black to blue-black staining. The term "amyloid" is derived from the [[Latin]] ''amyloideus'' ("starch-like").&lt;ref name="Ulloa 2014"/&gt; It refers to the fact that [[starch]] gives a similar reaction, also called an amyloid reaction. The test can either be on microscopic features, such as spore walls or [[hyphae|hyphal]] walls, or the apical apparatus on an [[ascus]], or be a macroscopic reaction on tissue where a drop of the reagent is applied. Negative reactions, called '''inamyloid''' or '''nonamyloid''' reactions are for structures that remain pale brown or clear. A reaction producing a deep reddish to reddish-brown staining is termed either a '''pseudoamyloid''' reaction or a '''dextrinoid''' reaction.

[[File:Folsom Street Fair IMG 6259 (cropped).jpg|thumb|A topless pony-girl pulling her mistress seated on a [[sulky]], at USA's [[Folsom Street Fair]], the world's largest [[Leather subculture|leather]] and [[Kink (sexual)|kink]] festival.]]

'''Animal roleplay''' is a form of [[Sexual roleplay|roleplay]] where at least one participant plays the part of a non-human [[animal]]. As with most forms of roleplay, its uses include [[play (BDSM)|play]] and [[psychodrama]].

Animal roleplay may also be found in [[BDSM]] contexts, where an individual may take part in a dominant/submissive relationship by being treated as an animal. The activity is often referred to as ''petplay''. However, not all types of animal roleplay within BDSM are petplay and not all petplay in BDSM involves roleplaying as an animal; some can be referred to as primal play and [[Furry fandom|furry]] play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.siriuspup.net/info/ |title=About Sirius Pups |work=SiriusPup|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{double image|right|Nude pet girl.jpg|150|Walking the dog (2603306717).jpg|141|A girl (left) and a man (right) crawling like pet animals at [[Folsom Street Fair]]. They are held using dog [[leash]].}}

The origins of animal [[roleplay]] and petplay are probably various and diverse, again depending upon the participants involved.  However, its origins are certainly influenced by [[Creature suit|costuming]], [[fiction]], [[mythology|myth]] and [[legend]], roleplay and [[psychodrama]] in their various aspects. Some of the earliest published images of animal play (especially pony play) are to be found in the work of [[John Willie]], primarily in ''[[John Willie#John Willie's Work and Bizarre|Bizarre]]'' magazine published from 1946 to 1959.

Some of the equipment that can be used in animal roleplay include [[leash]], [[chain]], [[Gag (BDSM)#Bit|bit gag]], [[collar (BDSM)|neck collar]], [[bondage harness]], [[catsuit]], [[bodystocking]], [[Butt plug#Fetish plugs|butt plug]], [[Muzzle (device)|muzzle]], [[ballet boot]]s, etc.&lt;ref name=Taormino2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taormino|first1=Tristan|title=The ultimate guide to kink : BDSM, role play, and the erotic edge|date=2012|publisher=Cleis Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9781573447829|chapter=Chapter 12. A romp on the wild side: erotic human animal roleplaying}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural and ritual use===
{{see also|Therianthropy|Skin-walker}}
Non-sexual animal roleplay was a common and integral part of [[ritual]] in many tribal cultures both in recent and likely prehistoric times, where a member (or members) of the tribe would take the role physically and often spiritually of an animal that was either revered or hunted. Examples of the former include many of the [[American Indian tribes]] and [[Inuit|Arctic native peoples]]. Examples of the latter are evidenced by [[cave painting]]s. In 1911, [[Julia Tuell]] photographed the last Animal Dance ("[[Massaum]]") performed by the Northern [[Cheyenne]] of [[Montana]].

It is also sometimes used in [[education]], especially [[physical education]], as a way to encourage people to [[exercise]] the body in unusual ways, by [[mimic]]king various animals.

==Other forms==
{{see also|Play (activity)}}
[[Image:Kittyplay.jpeg|thumb|Model in a kitten-play or cat-play outfit]]
In manga and anime, a relatively common character type is the "[[catgirl]]". A standard catgirl resembles a slim girl with cat ears, a tail, tiny fangs and a propensity for catlike [[affection]] or curiosity.  Examples include Cat Girl [[Nuku Nuku]], Pink from ''[[Dragon Pink]]'' and Ms. Furbottom's human form in [[Sgt. Frog]], among others. Real-life costume play, or ''[[cosplay]]'', of [[anime]] [[catgirls]] could be considered a form of pet play. That catgirls are humanoids with lesser attributes of felines means that the costume is an especially simple one, and therefore quite popular among convention-goers. Though kittenlike timidity and submissiveness are prominent elements of catgirl charm, the role does not include the "heavier", more overt kink that is usually synonymous with BDSM pet play.

Some [[superhero]]es, [[heroine]]s, and [[villain]]s also feature elements related to pet play; such as [[DC Comics]]'s [[Wildcat (comics)|Wildcat]], [[Catwoman]], [[Penguin (comics)|the Penguin]] and [[Vixen (comics)|Vixen]], [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]]'s [[Tigra]], [[Man-Wolf]] and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], or even [[Nastassja Kinski]]'s Irena Gallier in the 1982 film ''[[Cat People (1982 film)|Cat People]]'' (a remake of the [[Cat People (1942 film)|1942 Simone Simon film]]), and Miss Kitty from the [[Brendan Fraser]] movie ''[[Monkeybone]]''.  All involve animal qualities taken on by a human.  Some would even count the enactment or spiritual belief in therianthropy ([[Werewolf|werewolves]], [[werecat]]s, etc.) as falling under human animal roleplay or transformation play as well.

[[Peter Shaffer]]'s 1973 play ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]'' tells the story of a young man who has a pathological religious fascination with horses, but this appears closer to zoophilia than pet play. [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s 1981 musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]]'' traces a tribe of urban cats, and in 2007 ''[[War Horse (play)|War Horse]]'' used full size puppets to play horses on stage.

==Erotic scenarios==

{{double image|right|Nude pet slave girl.jpg|140|Folsom Bondage (cropped).jpg|140|A submissive woman is [[erotic humiliation|publicly disgraced]] by being paraded nude at [[Folsom Street Fair]]. She is held in [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] using a dog [[leash]], one end of which is held by her [[Master/slave (BDSM)|master]]. This suggests she is [[sexual roleplay|roleplaying]] his pet animal.|A gagged woman with bound hands sits in a submissive position. Her master holds her with a dog chain tied around her neck at [[Folsom Street Fair|Folsom Fair]].}}

Like much of erotic play and roleplay, animal roleplay in an erotic or relational context is entirely defined by the people involved and by their mood and interests at the time of play. It ranges from the simple imitation of a vocal "whinnying" of a horse to the barking, panting or playful nudging of a puppy, or playful behaviour of a kitten, to crawling around on all fours and being fed, or petted, by hand. To the greater extremes of dressing up as a pony in modified horse tack, masks, [[prosthetic]]s and temporary bondage based body modification (such as binding the forearms to the upperarms and/or the calves to the thighs).

Public participation in human animal roleplay is varied. A couple could inconspicuously role-play a pet play scene in public, which would look to the casual observer like one partner is merely stroking the other's neck. In the case of some BDSM [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]]ists, one partner may wear a [[Collar (BDSM)|dog collar]] with a [[leash]] attached.

The reasons for playing such a character or animal can vary as much as the physical manifestations and intensity of the play.  Some people enjoy being able to "cut loose" into a different, or more dynamic personality (e.g., were-creatures or [[catgirls]]; see [[#Other variations|other variations]]).  In some cases, pet play is seen as a loving, quiet cuddling time where there is no need for verbalizations and the simple act of stroking, rubbing and holding the other partner is satisfying or reassuring in and of itself for those involved.  For others, there may be a [[spirituality|spiritual]] side to it.  Some feel closer to their animal [[totem]], while others may identify with something akin to a deeper side or part of their own psyche (known as [[Therianthropy#Psychiatric aspects|therianthropy]]).  For still others, there is the experience of [[Power exchange (BDSM)|power exchange]] setup in a context or structure which they can accept.

Some cases could be considered a type of animal transformation fantasy. They can have strong elements of [[exhibitionism]], be totally enjoyed in the privacy of the home, or lie somewhere between either boundary. While not widespread, erotic human-animal roleplay is still enjoyed by a sizable number of people. However, it is still primarily identified with [[BDSM]] practice. Though commonly misinterpreted as being associated with [[Furry fandom#Sexual aspects|furry]] or other [[alternative lifestyle]] activities, that is generally not the case though some instances may exist.

For most participants, it has no connection whatsoever with [[Zoophilia|bestiality]], which is controversial and would usually be considered [[edgeplay]] in BDSM circles.

{{Anchor|Autozoophilia}}
'''Autozoophilia''' is sexual arousal that depends on acting out or imagining one's self as an animal. [[Paraphilia|Paraphilic interest]]s that involve being in another form have been referred to as [[erotic target location error]]s (ETLEs), and autozoophilia would represent an [[autoerotic]] form of [[zoophilia]].&lt;ref name="lawrence"&gt;Lawrence, A. A. (2009). Erotic target location errors: An underappreciated paraphilic dimension. ''Journal of Sex Research, 46,'' 194-215.&lt;/ref&gt; Autozoophilia is mostly practised by wearing an animal costume, such as a [[latex mask]], [[mascot|mascot costume]] or [[fursuit]].

===Other considerations===
Each type of play can focus on a certain "strength" of an animal character.  Pony play often involves the practice and training that a [[horse]] owner or [[horse trainer|trainer]] would put their horse through to learn how to walk, [[canter]], etc., as modified for human limbs.  Puppy and kitten play often can involve BDSM related discipline.  Cow Play often involves fantasies of [[lactation]] and [[impregnation]].  The usual limits of [[safe, sane and consensual]] apply to roleplay as much as any other activity between humans who accept and respect their partner's interests and limits. For most, this does not include bestiality.

Note: Just because one partner is playing the "pet" does not necessarily make them the passive or submissive play partner in the [[scene (BDSM)|scene]].  For example, if the form of pet play is for the meek and timid wife to "transform" into a [[werewolf]] or mischievous [[anime]] [[catgirl]], she may take the upper hand and dominate the partner.  Again, how the play is interpreted is entirely up to the people involved.

===BDSM scenarios===
Some people believe that they have certain animal '[[instinct]]s' and through animal roleplay can let them out. This is especially true in the BDSM communities, where some people 'live' as their chosen animal 24/7.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} This type of mentality goes beyond roleplay and becomes a full lifestyle for the parties involved. There are also 'hybrids'. These are humans who live part-time as one type of animal, and part-time as another. This is usually determined by the situation.

There seems to be a growing trend among the BDSM scene in animal roleplay, especially pup and kitten play. Playing the role of a pup or kitten is one of giving over complete control over to another, while the 'master or handler' expects only unconditional love and obedience from his/her animal.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Pony play is where at least one of the participants dresses to resemble and assumes the mannerisms and character of an [[equine]] animal. People involved in pony-play ("ponies") generally divide themselves to three groups&lt;ref name=maxawesome/&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2012}} although some will participate in more than one category:

*Cart ponies pull a [[sulky]] with their owner.
*Riding ponies are ridden, either on all fours or on two legs, with the "rider" on the shoulders of the "pony" (also known as ''Shoulder riding''). Note that a human back is generally not strong enough to take the weight of another adult without risk of injury, so four-legged "riding" is generally symbolic, with the "rider" taking most of their weight on their own legs.
*Show ponies show off their [[dressage]] skills and often wear elaborate harnesses, plumes and so on.

A documentary film ''Pony Passion'' was produced by British pony play club De Ferre in 2003 showing their club's activities and the 2005 [[documentary film]], ''Born in a Barn'', depicted the lives of several pony-play enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0476963/|title=Born in a Barn|date=1 February 2005|accessdate=24 September 2017|website=IMDb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pony play is sometimes referred to as "The Aristotelian Perversion", in reference to an apocryphal story where the philosopher [[Aristotle]] was persuaded to let a woman named Phyllis ride him like a horse, in promised exchange for sexual favors: an episode depicted in various woodcuts and other works of art.&lt;ref name=maxawesome&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maximumawesome.com/pervfriday/ponypeople.htm|title=Pony people, ponyboys and ponygirls|author=Malfouka|accessdate=February 14, 2011}}{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=August 2012}}

====Puppy play====
{{double image|right|Submissivepup.jpg|183|Pup is looking amazing in her neoprene dog hood as part of human pup pride in Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras 2016.jpg|173|A submissive male "puppy" using bondage restraints to restrict movement and eating from a dog bowl. The cage in background and kneepads are for extended play.|A pup with a neoprene dog hood at [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras|Sydney Mardi Gras]]. Masks and hoods are frequently used to help a person feel less human and more connected to a "dog persona".}}

In puppy play, or pup play, at least one of the participants acts out [[dog|canine]] mannerisms and behaviors, which is sometimes associated with [[leather culture]]. If there is a dominant role it can be  taken by a "handler", "trainer", "master", or in the case of someone who also identifies as a pup, an "alpha". If there is a submissive this may be considered by a "pup" or a "dog". Unlike other forms of animal roleplay, it is not uncommon for two or more pups to play together as equals, fight for dominance, or play where one is clearly the "alpha".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-an-alpha/|title=What is an Alpha?|website=SIRIUSPUP|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puppy play is often about being playful, mischievous, cheeky and instinctive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dog_play/ Dog play in the BDSM Dictionary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511083559/http://www.informedconsent.co.uk/dictionary/Dog_play/ |date=May 11, 2008 }} accessed 4 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Many human puppies like to simplify their desires and motivations as they embrace the side of themselves that acts solely on instinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siriuspup.net/what-is-human-pup-play/|title=What is human pup play?|website=SIRIUSPUP|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to other BDSM play, a "puppy" who is "unowned" or "[[Collar (BDSM)|uncollared]]" can be referred to as a "stray". Many pups use a headspace when getting into a roleplay scenario known as 'pup space' which allows them to take on their puppy persona more easily.{{clarify|date=February 2018}}{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Other elements rooted in BDSM play involve bondage and restriction with collars, leashes, kneepads, harnesses, rubber suits, hoods and mitts. Both sexual and non-sexual services are requested, and "training" may take place in order to teach commands or tricks.

There are groups across the world involved in puppy play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pupplay.info/ |title=Pup Play? |work=Puppy Play|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a number in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://seapah.com/puppy-play-101/ |title=Information on puppy play |work=SEA-PAH|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pup Pride Australia has participated, since 2015, in the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mardigras.org.au/2017-parade-float-running-order/ |title=2017 parade float running order - Float 103 |date=2017|work=Mardi Gras|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has featured in an Australian TV documentary aired by the [[Special Broadcasting Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand/video/726963267928/pup-play-men-who-live-as-dogs |title=Pup play men who live as dogs |date=18 July 2016|work=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kitten play====
In kitten play, a person dresses to resemble and assumes the mannerisms and character of a kitten or cat, a characteristic of which is that it keeps some independence and, as part of the fantasy, might retaliate against the partner trying to tame/train him or her. Some might be trained to do tricks such as bring toys back, to beg, or go on walks. Like in puppy play, a "kitten" or "cat" that is unowned or [[collaring (BDSM)|uncollared]] may be called a "stray".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kitten-play.com/what-is-kitten-play/  |title=What is kitten play? |work=Kitten-Play|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3531">The '''''Bibliothèque universelle''''' was an [[academic journal]] published by a group of Genevan scholars first centred on [[Marc-Auguste Pictet]] (1752–1825), later around [[Auguste Arthur de la Rive]] (1801–1873) and other scholars. It enjoyed a wide audience in the various French-speaking countries of Europe during the 19th century.

The initial form of the journal was the ''[[Bibliothèque Britannique]]'', which began publication in 1796, and focused on British science, techniques, literature and agriculture. Its founders and editors were Marc-Auguste Pictet ("Sciences &amp; Arts"), [[Charles Pictet de Rochemont]] ("Literature") and Frédéric-Guillaume Maurice ("Agriculture").&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionnaire historique suisse'', notice ''Bibliothèque universelle'', par Doris Jakubec, 30 septembre 2004 [http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/f/F24583.php]&lt;/ref&gt; This journal was succeeded in 1816 by the ''Bibliothèque universelle des sciences, belles-lettres, et arts'', which kept the same editors until 1824–25 and was also published in three series, one focusing on science and techniques, another on literature and a third one on agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Bickerton, Marc-Auguste and Charles Pictet, the "Bibliothèque britannique" (1796–1815) and the dissemination of British literature and science on the Continent, Genève, Slatkine, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Pictet's death (1825), the periodical was taken over by Georges Maurice (1799–1839) and Pictet de Rochemont's two sons, soon joined by a group of Genevan scholars including [[Etienne Dumont]], [[Pellegrino Rossi]], [[Jacob Frederic Lullin de Châteauvieux]], as well as [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]] and Auguste De la Rive for the scientific part.

In 1836, the two main series, science and literature, were merged for a period of ten years under the leadership of Auguste De la Rive and given the name of ''Bibliothèque universelle de Genève''. In 1846, the periodical was divided again between a series on literature, which kept the name of "Bibliothèque Universelle" and a series on science, which took the name of "Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles".

The "Bibliothèque Universelle" went through many changes, which did not prevent its encyclopedic formula to become gradually obsolete. It disappeared in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Maggetti, Yves Bridel, Roger Francillon, La Bibliothèque universelle, 1815-1924: miroir de la sensibilité romande au XIXe siècle, Lausanne, Payot, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Archives des Sciences Physiques et Naturelles" were edited until the first World War by Genevan men of science such as Auguste De la Rive, [[François-Jules Pictet-De la Rive]] (1809–1872), [[Casimir Pyrame de Candolle]] (1836–1918) and [[Edouard Sarasin]] (1843–1917). Renamed "Archives des Sciences" in 1947, this periodical maintained its three issues a year until 2004. It still exists today as a local and non-specialized periodical of natural history and history of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/bibliothqueuniv22unkngoog|work=Internet Archive|title=Bibliothèque universelle des sciences, belles-lettres, et arts (1816)|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCB, polychorinated biphenyls, are a type of chemical that was widely used in the 1960s and 1970s, and which is a contamination source of soil and water. They are fairly stable and therefore persistent in the environment. '''Bioremediation of PCBs''' is the use of microorganisms to degrade PCBs from contaminated sites, which can be either a soil or aqueous environment. It is a process relying on multiple microorganisms' co-metabolism. [[Anaerobic microorganism]]s dechlorinate PCBs first, and other microorganisms that are capable of doing [[BH pathway]] can break down the dechlorinated PCBs to usable intermediates like [[acyl-CoA]] or [[carbon dioxide]]. If no BH pathway-caple microorganisms are present, dechlorinated PCBs can be mineralized with help of fungi and plants. However, there are multiple limiting factors for this co-metabolism.

== Overview ==

=== PCBs ===
[[File:PCB_general_structure.svg|right|254x254px]]
[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) are various [[biphenyl]] based artificial products that are widely used as a [[dielectric]] fluid, industrial [[coolant]], and [[lubricant]]s in the 1960s and 1970s. There is no evidence its synthesis occurs naturally.  They are classified as persistent organic pollutants. PCBs share the basic chemical structure of biphenyl and one or more of the hydrogen atoms on the [[aromatic ring]]s are replaced by chlorine atoms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Passatore|first=Laura|last2=Rossetti|first2=Simona|last3=Juwarkar|first3=Asha A.|last4=Massacci|first4=Angelo|date=2014-08-15|title=Phytoremediation and bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): State of knowledge and research perspectives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389414003963|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=278|pages=189–202|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.05.051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCBs is in viscous liquid form at normal temperature and has a poor solubility in water. The aromatic hydrocarbon structure gives PCBs relatively high molecular stability. The chlorine substitution further reinforces its insolubility and chemical stability. Hence, the degradation of PCBs in the natural environment is very slow, which can range from 3 to 37 years depending on the number of chloride substitutions and their positions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Bioremediation ===
[[Bioremediation]] is a waste removal method that uses microorganisms to degrade or remove wastes like organic waste and heavy metal from contaminated sites including both soil and water. The advantages of bioremediation are that it is environment-friendly, inexpensive and can remove multiple wastes simultaneously comparing with traditional chemical and physical processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/805006965|title=Bioremediation methods and protocols|last=P.,|first=Cummings, Stephen|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=9781607614395|oclc=805006965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degradation Process ==
Various microorganisms are involved in a two-stage process of degradation of PCBs, which happens in aerobic and anaerobic environments. Degrading PCBs is similar to the degradation of biphenyl.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the chlorines on PCBs prevent them from being utilized as a substrate of biphenyl degradation. Due to high chemical stability, PCBs cannot be used as energy sources.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohtsubo|first=Yoshiyuki|last2=Kudo|first2=Toshiaki|last3=Tsuda|first3=Masataka|last4=Nagata|first4=Yuji|date=2004-08-01|title=Strategies for bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-004-1654-y|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=250–258|doi=10.1007/s00253-004-1654-y|issn=0175-7598}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the chlorination, PCBs can be used as electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration to store energy, which is also the first stage of the degradation pathway, reductive dechlorination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the PCBs are dechlorinated to a certain degree, usually lower than five chlorines presenting in the structure and one aromatic ring has no chlorine,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they can undergo the biphenyl degradation pathway (BP pathway) to be degraded to accessible carbon or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the aerobic environment. BP pathway is a pathway that utilizes series of enzymes ([[BphA]], B, C, D, E, F, G) to convert biphenyl to [[TCA Cycle|TCA cycle]] intermediates ([[pyruvate]] and [[Acyl-CoA]]) and [[benzoate]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, there are few microorganisms that can dechlorinate substrate under natural conditions. Even with selective media, the accumulation of PCB dechlorinating microorganisms is still slow, which is one reason for the slow degradation rate. As a result, PCBs usually go through a co-metabolism pathway that involving different microorganism species.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vasilyeva|first=G. K.|last2=Strijakova|first2=E. R.|date=2007-12-01|title=Bioremediation of soils and sediments contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S002626170706001X|journal=Microbiology|language=en|volume=76|issue=6|pages=639–653|doi=10.1134/S002626170706001X|issn=0026-2617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, there are four steps in this process:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# In order for PCBs to enter the cell, they firstly need to be solubilized.
# PCBs are dechlorinated by anaerobic bacteria, then transport the metabolites to [[aerobic bacteria]] or fungi through a [[biofilm]].
# The presence of PCBs metabolites triggers the expression of enzymes in BP pathway.
# PCBs are broken down to Acetyl-CoA and then can be utilized or carbon dioxide.
The Figure below shows the complete degradation pathway.  [[File:PCBs' Degradation Pathway.jpg|thumb|495x495px]]

== Limiting Factors ==

=== PCBs entering the cells ===
PCBs have low water solubility, so they adhere tightly to soil and cannot be easily accessed by bacteria. Especially, if the contaminations site has been exposed to PCBs for long period, PCBs can be integrated into soil or sediment matrices, then further decrease their bioavailability. Some surfactants can help solubilize but cannot increase the rate of PCBs degrading. However, if PCBs are linked to surfactants tightly too, then this process cannot promote the absorption of PCBs and even lower it. Also, many surfactants have been proven to be toxic to cells and the high cost of surfactants is another issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== PCBs properties ===
PCBs are toxic to bacterial communities above 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. However, if the concentration is too low (lower than 50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), the degradation slows down significantly, for there is not enough material to stimulate the expression of required genes and support the growth of competent microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; PCBs includes various different compounds with slightly different structures. Those slight differences make big differences in metabolic rate. Generally speaking, the more chlorines in a PCB molecule, the harder for it to be degraded. In particular,  microorganisms cannot degrade di- and tetra-ortho substituted well. It is possible that those structures prevent enzymes from accessing reaction sites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Soil and sediment characteristics ===
First, the soil and [[sediment]] structures will determine how tightly PCBs are adhered to them and affect the absorption of PCBs into cells. The PCBs’ availability suffers from increasing organic carbon and clay content, for they promote the absorption of PCBs into soil or sediment matrices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Second, the soil contains necessary nutrition for the growth of microbes and anaerobic and aerobic environments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Finally, the local microbial population has significant impacts on the rate of degradation of PCBs, which varies based on the microbial strains and their activities. Then, if there is no history of exposure to PCBs, it may take months for microbes to activates their ability to dechlorinate PCBs and break them down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gene expression and bottleneck effect of metabolites ===
PCBs or biphenyl cannot provide energy for microbes, so they are primary energy and carbon sources. As stated before it takes months sometimes for microorganisms to activate their gene for dichlorine after the first exposure to PCBs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been proposed to use analogs to promote the activation of genes. However, even after the metabolic pathway is activated, the intermediates of the pathway create a bottleneck effect due to their toxicity. Also, there is the possibility that BP pathway leads to [[protoanemonin]] which is a dead-end metabolite that cannot be utilized by cells. Due to the high energy cost of this pathway, if no preferred energy source present in the system, cells will not activate this pathway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Burton MacDonald''' (born September 13, 1939) is a Canadian [[biblical archaeologist]] specialising in the archaeology of [[Jordan]]. He has been a professor at [[St. Francis Xavier University]] since 1965.

==Early life and education==
MacDonald attended [[St. Francis Xavier University]] (St. F. X.) and graduated with a BA in philosophy in 1960. He then began studies at St. Paul's Seminary, part of the [[University of Ottawa]], where he obtained a baccalaureate in theology in 1962, a licentiate in theology in 1964, and a masters in religious education in 1965. After working as a priest and two years teaching at Xavier College (now [[Cape Breton University]]) and St. F. X., he enrolled in the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literature at the [[The Catholic University of America|Catholic University of America]] (CUA), where he obtained a PhD in 1974 with a dissertation on the biblical [[Tribe of Benjamin]]. He also studied at the ''[[École Biblique et Archéologique Française de Jérusalem|École Biblique et Archéologique Française]]'' in [[Jerusalem]] between 1969 and 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burton MacDonald|url=http://sites.stfx.ca/religious_studies/burton_macdonald|website=St. Francis Xavier University|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
MacDonald returned to St. F. X. in 1972 as a professor in the Department of Theology (later the Department of Religious Studies). He became a [[Professor (highest academic rank)|full professor]] in 1989 and served as the chair of the department between 1992 and 1995 and 1996 to 2000. He held the Father Edo Gatto Chair of Christian Studies in 2006.

MacDonald first became involved in archaeological fieldwork whilst studying at the ''École Biblique'', including the sites of [[Gezer]] (1970) and [[Tell el-Hesi]] (1971) in [[Israel]]. He then joined excavations led by [[G. Ernest Wright]] at Idalion, [[Cyprus]] (1971). After further work at Idalion (1974) and Tell el-Hesi (1975), he was introduced to the archaeology of Jordan as a member of the ''Expedition to the Dead Sea Plain'', directed by Walter E. Rast and R. Thomas Schaub (1977) and the ''Central Moab Survey'', directed by J. Maxwell Miller (1979).  He also participated in the [[University of Toronto]]'s ''The Wadi Tumilat Project, East Nile Delta, Tell al Maskhuta, Egypt'', under the directorship of John S. Holladay (1978–1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Burton MacDonald's Homepage: CV: Archaeological Fieldwork Experience|url=http://people.stfx.ca/bmacdona/welcome.html|website=St. F.X.U.|accessdate=13 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''casebook''' is a type of [[textbook]] used primarily by students in [[law school]]s.&lt;ref name="ah83"&gt;Wayne L. Anderson and Marilyn J. Headrick, ''The Legal Profession: Is it for you?'' (Cincinnati: Thomson Executive Press, 1996), 83.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than simply laying out the [[legal doctrine]] in a particular area of study, a casebook contains excerpts from [[legal case]]s in which the law of that area was applied.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; It is then up to the student to analyze the language of the case in order to determine what rule was applied and how the [[court]] applied it.&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt;  Casebooks sometimes also contain excerpts from [[law review]] articles and [[legal treatise]]s,  historical notes, editorial commentary, and other related materials to provide background for the cases.

The teaching style based on casebooks is known as the [[casebook method]] and is supposed to instill in law students how to "think like a [[lawyer]]."&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; The casebook method is most often used in law schools in countries with [[common law]] [[legal systems of the world|legal systems]], where [[case law]] is a major [[source of law]].

Most casebooks are authored by law [[professors]], usually with two, three, or four authors, at least one of whom will be a professor at the top of his or her field in the area under discussion. New editions of casebooks often retain the names of famous professors on their covers decades after those professors have died. Updating of the books, then, falls on the shoulders of a younger generation of their colleagues. Such casebooks are often known by the names of the leading professor authors, such as [[William Prosser (academic)|Prosser]], Wade, &amp; Schwartz's, ''[[Torts]]: Cases &amp; Materials'' (now in a 13th edition).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The leading publishers of casebooks in the United States are [[Thomson West]] (publisher of the Foundation Press and American Casebook Series imprints), [[Aspen Publishing]], and [[LexisNexis]]. Each of these publishers uses a quickly identifiable color and pattern for their book covers across all subjects.  Traditionally, the covers of casebooks come in the colors red, blue, or brown,&lt;ref name="ah83" /&gt; although West's American Casebook Series has switched to faded black cloth as an environmental move.

The prevalence of the casebook method in American law schools has given rise to a market for commercial study aids "keyed" to a particular casebook edition.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, 84.&lt;/ref&gt; These study aids are generally summaries ("[[Brief (law)|briefs]]") of the cases from the casebook to which it is "keyed," presenting them in the same order as the casebook. Often written by the same author who wrote the associated casebook, and published by the same company, "keyed" study aids are useful in distilling cases down to [[Black letter law|black-letter law]]. Popular study aid product lines include Legalines, High Court Case Summaries, and Gilbert Law Summaries published by West Thomson Reuters, Casenotes Legal Briefs by Aspen, and the Understanding series and Q&amp;A series by LexisNexis.

{{Biological classification}}

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|biological classification]], '''class''' ({{lang-la|classis}}) is  a [[taxonomic rank]], as well as a taxonomic unit, a [[taxon]], in that rank.{{efn|When the term denotes taxonomic units, the plural is classes (Latin ''classes'').}} Other well-known ranks in descending order of size are [[life]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[order (biology)|order]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], and [[species]], with class fitting between phylum and order. As for the other well-known ranks, there is the option of an immediately lower rank, indicated by the prefix ''sub-'': subclass (Latin: ''subclassis''). For example, [[dog]]s are in the class [[Mammalia]].

The composition of each class is determined by a [[taxonomist]]. Often there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists taking different positions. There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in describing a class, but for well-known animals there is likely to be consensus. 

In botany, classes are now rarely discussed. Since the first publication of the [[APG system]] in 1998, which proposed a taxonomy of the [[flowering plant]]s up to the level of orders, many sources have preferred to treat ranks higher than orders as informal [[clade]]s. Where formal ranks have been assigned, the ranks have been reduced to a very much lower level, e.g. class Equisitopsida for the land plants, with the major divisions within the class assigned to subclasses and superorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Chase |first=Mark W. |last2=Reveal |first2=James L. |year=2009 |title=A phylogenetic classification of the land plants to accompany APG III |journal=Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society |volume=161 |issue=2 |pages=122–127 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8339.2009.01002.x |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hierarchy of ranks ==
For some clades, a number of alternative classifications are used.

===History of the concept===
The class as a distinct rank of biological classification having its own distinctive name (and not just called a ''top-level genus'' ''(genus summum)'') was first introduced by the [[France|French]] [[botanist]] [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in his classification of plants that appeared in his ''Eléments de botanique'', 1694.

In the first edition of his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr E.]] (1982). ''The Growth of Biological Thought''. Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-36446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus]] divided all three of his [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of Nature ([[mineral]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s) into classes. Only in the animal kingdom are Linnaeus's classes similar to the classes used today; his classes and orders of plants were never intended to represent natural groups, but rather to provide a convenient "artificial key" according to his ''[[Linnaean taxonomy#Classification for plants|Systema Sexuale]]'', largely based on the arrangement of flowers.

The class was considered the highest level of the taxonomic hierarchy until [[George Cuvier]]'s ''embranchements'', first called [[Phylum|Phyla]] by [[Ernst Haeckel]],&lt;ref&gt;Collins, A.G., Valentine, J.W. (2001). [http://si-pddr.si.edu/jspui/bitstream/10088/7403/1/Collins_Valentine_EvDev2001.pdf "Defining phyla: evolutionary pathways to metazoan body plans."] ''Evol. Dev''. '''3''': 432-442.&lt;/ref&gt; were introduced in the early nineteenth century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20616">{{Further information|Theories of urban planning}}
'''Communicative planning''' is an approach to [[urban planning]] that gathers stakeholders and engages them in a process to make decisions together in a manner that respects the positions of all involved.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collaborative Planning: Shaping Places in Fragmented Societies|last=Healey|first=Patsy|publisher=UBC Press|year=1997|isbn=0774805986|location=|pages=5|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also sometimes called collaborative planning among planning practitioners or collaborative planning model.

== History and theory ==
Since the 1970s, communicative planning theory has formed based on several key understandings. These key points include the notions that communication and reasoning come in diverse forms, knowledge is socially constructed, and people’s diverse interests and preferences are formed out of their social contexts.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Healey|first=Patsy|year=1996|title=The Communicative Turn in Planning Theory and its Implications for Spatial Strategy Formation|url=|journal=Readings in Planning Theory|volume=23|pages=217–234|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1068/b230217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communicative theory also draws on [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] analyses of power in that it recognizes that power relations exist in practice and have the ability to oppress individuals.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Specific to a community and urban planning context, communicative theory acknowledges that planners' own actions, words, lived experiences, and communication styles have an effect on the planning process the planner is facilitating.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Finally, communicative planning theory advances the idea that planning happens in everyday practice and social relations, and consensus-building can be used to organize people's thoughts and move past traditional ways of knowing and decision-making.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

In the 1990s, a number of planning scholars began writing about a new orientation to urban planning theory that moved away from the prevalent rational approach to planning. [[Judith Innes]] is credited with coining the term "communicative planning" in her article ''Planning Theory’s Emerging Paradigm: Communicative Action and Interactive Practice.''&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith|year=1995|title=Planning Theory’s Emerging Paradigm: Communicative Action and Interactive Practice|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/14/3/183.extract|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|volume=14|pages=183–189|via=SAGE Journals|doi=10.1177/0739456x9501400307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Innes' tries to bridge the gap between planning theories and planning in practice, and offers consensus-building as a tool for urban planners to create collaborative and engaging planning environments that allow different stakeholders to participate.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|last2=Booher|first2=David E.|date=1999-12-31|title=Consensus Building and Complex Adaptive Systems|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369908976071|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=65|issue=4|pages=412–423|doi=10.1080/01944369908976071|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Booher|first=David E.|last2=Innes|first2=Judith E.|date=2002-03-01|title=Network Power in Collaborative Planning|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/21/3/221|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=221–236|doi=10.1177/0739456X0202100301|issn=0739-456X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|last2=Booher|first2=David E.|date=1999-03-31|title=Consensus Building as Role Playing and Bricolage|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01944369908976031|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=65|issue=1|pages=9–26|doi=10.1080/01944369908976031|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

Around the same time as this article was published, Patsy Healey also published a number of planning theory texts exploring communicative and collaborative planning. Drawing on the theory of [[Jürgen Habermas]] in particular, Healey's work focuses on the impact that communicative acts (which can be in spoken or written form) have on a community planning process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Healey also expands on the work of urban planner [[John F. Forester]] and economic geographer [[Bent Flyvbjerg]], both of whom examine Habermasian communication and power structures in their planning work.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The emerging field of therapeutic planning is closely related to communicative planning. Therapeutic planning operates on the basis that communities can experience collective trauma, including from past planning processes, and that carefully facilitated community engagement can act as catalysts for community-wide healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Erfan|first=Aftab|date=2016-11-21|title=Confronting collective traumas: an exploration of therapeutic planning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649357.2016.1249909|journal=Planning Theory &amp; Practice|volume=0|issue=1|pages=1–17|doi=10.1080/14649357.2016.1249909|issn=1464-9357}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aftab|first=Erfan,|date=2013-09-09|title=An experiment in therapeutic planning : learning with the Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw First Nations|url=https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0074273|doi=10.14288/1.0074273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ENsYDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61&amp;lpg=PA61&amp;dq=therapeutic+planning+community&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6BKoIae-W0&amp;sig=cRmujL8p6qsJhL9fG0b_YN6ZFXc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjS6djzttfQAhUG9GMKHXhZBaAQ6AEIRjAH#v=onepage&amp;q=therapeutic%20planning%20community&amp;f=false|title=The Global City and the Holy City: Narratives on Knowledge, Planning and Diversity|last=Fenster|first=Tovi|date=2016-09-16|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317880097|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some planning practitioners use untraditional planning approaches, such as filmmaking and other artistic media, to engage community members in therapeutic planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sandercock|first=Leonie|last2=Attili|first2=Giovanni|date=2014-01-16|title=Changing the Lens Film as Action Research and Therapeutic Planning Practice|url=http://jpe.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/16/0739456X13516499|journal=Journal of Planning Education and Research|language=en|pages=0739456X13516499|doi=10.1177/0739456X13516499|issn=0739-456X|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Communicative process and tools ==
In a communicative planning process, planning practitioners play more of a facilitative role. They often act as a ‘knowledge mediator and broker’&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; to help reframe problems in order to promote more creative thinking about possible solutions.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Planning in divided cities: collaborative shaping of contested space|last=Gaffikin|first=Frank|last2=Morrissey|first2=Mike|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|year=2011|isbn=978-1-405-19218-7|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout this process, information should be produced collectively by the full range of stakeholders who may be affected by the outcome of the process.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|date=1998-03-31|title=Information in Communicative Planning|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01944369808975956|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=64|issue=1|pages=52–63|doi=10.1080/01944369808975956|issn=0194-4363}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, all of the stakeholders should be involved in negotiating both the problem definition and the solution together.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In doing so, solutions to conflicts amongst stakeholders may be re-framed as ‘win-win’, as opposed to the ‘zero sum’ mindset which occurs when stakeholders are bargaining on the basis of their own fixed interests.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Consensus-building is an important part of this collective meaning-making process, as information is discussed and validated within the group of sakeholders, resulting in information which holds more significance to the group.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

To aid in consensus-building efforts, power should be distributed amongst the stakeholders such that they are equals in the process.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Openness and trust are also crucial for building consensus.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The objectives, underlying assumptions, and positions of these stakeholders should be considered along with the uncertainties about future conditions, such as population growth, and decisions which are linked to other decisions.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakraborty|first=Arnab|date=2012-03-01|title=Recognizing Uncertainty and Linked Decisions in Public Participation: A New Framework for Collaborative Urban Planning|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/sres.2102/abstract|journal=Systems Research and Behavioral Science|language=en|volume=29|issue=2|pages=131–148|doi=10.1002/sres.2102|issn=1099-1743}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is important to have the stakeholders identify this information for themselves, as it will help reduce the biases present in both analyses driven by only one future and position-based discussions, as well as bring to the forefront any conflicts between the underlying values of the stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; By considering this broad range of information, commonalities between different stakeholders may be identified, which can help build consensus. However, this cannot guarantee consensus, as positions might in fact be too different.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In order to deal with the challenges that arise from positions being very different and the increasing complexity of analysis required, new models of collaboration are needed which build on various principles of conflict management, including engaging early and engaging often.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

'''The Neighbourhood Revitalization Program (NRP) - 1990'''

In 1990, the city of [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]] launched a 20-year program designed to empower residents in local decision making and share community planning responsibilities among residential, government and private stakeholders.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Elwood|date=2002|title=Neighbourhood Revitalization through Collaboration: Assessing the implications of neoliberal urban policy at the grassroots.|journal=GeoJournal|volume=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat the dwindling standard of living within Minneapolis neighbourhoods, the NRP was conceptualized as a means of involving citizens in the prioritization of revitalization efforts. The Minneapolis government divided 400 million dollars between 81 neighbourhood organizations who utilized the funding over two decades to assess priorities, reach consensus and implement neighbourhood improvement projects.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Within the first decade of the NRP, 48% of funding was used for upgrading housing and 16% went towards job creation and economic developments.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=J.|last2=Pentel|first2=P.|date=2002|title=What the Neighbours Want: The Neighborhood Revitalization Program's First Decade.|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=68|issue=4|pages=435–449|doi=10.1080/01944360208976284}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other priorities included public safety, the preservation of green space and improving transportation infrastructure.

Through the completion and adoption of 66 unique neighbourhood plans, stakeholders from various organizations including the general public, [[Minneapolis Public Library]], Minneapolis Parks and Recreation, Public Works, Housing Inspection and [[Hennepin County]] all came together to articulate and agree upon feasible and mutually beneficial neighbourhood directives.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fung|date=2006|title=Empowered Participation in Urban Governance: The Minneapolis Revitalization Program.|journal=International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|volume=30|issue=3|pages=638–655|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2427.2006.00685.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; With emphasis placed on citizen participation, municipal planners took on an advisory role and assisted neighbourhood planning organizations in encouraging participation, engaging a diverse audience and reviewing completed plans through a technical lens.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Despite the creation of Participation Agreements which stood as formal commitments to holding an inclusive engagement process, the NRP has been criticized for a lack of representation from all neighbourhood members.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While the NRP has been applauded for its communicative and collaborative values, critics point to cases of exclusion and the enormous amount of continuous time and energy required for its success as main drawbacks.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Seattle's Neighbourhood Planning Program - 1994'''

In 1994, [[Seattle]] developed the Neighbourhood Planning Program (NPP) in response to outcry from the general public surrounding a lack of involvement in a recently completed comprehensive plan.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Siranni|first=Carmen|date=2007|title=Neighbourhood Planning as Collaborative Design|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|volume=73|issue=4|pages=373–387}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NPP intended to build a partnership between residents and the local government and provided neighbourhoods with the choice to create their own unique local plan or continue by the comprehensive plan. While these neighbourhood plans had to be consistent with the broad goals of the comprehensive plan, participating neighbourhoods were afforded the opportunity to identify their own priorities and provide a list of recommendations to the city.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Initially, each participating neighbourhood was given 10,000 dollars to begin a communicative engagement process and identify a vision for their local community.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neighbor Power: Building Community the Seattle Way|last=Diers|first=Jim|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=Seattle|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional funding for the planning stage would not be rewarded until the City felt as though enough stakeholders and community representatives had been included in the process.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Building Community Capacity: How collaborative planning is changing the culture of governance in Seattle.|last=Kobler|first=A|publisher=Iowa State University ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the visioning process was deemed to be inclusive and rigorous, the city provided each neighbourhood with between 60,000-100,000 dollars to develop a plan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In total, 38 neighbourhoods participated and developed their own neighbourhood plan for the municipality to follow.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   Before approving each neighbourhood plan, the municipality would hold public hearings in the neighbourhood to share the plan and ensure there was consensus among all the residents in the area.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  By 1999, the City had adopted these plans and began implementing the shared visions of each neighbourhood.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Each plan varied significantly as each neighbourhood was afforded the opportunity to hire their own planner or consultants to assist them in the process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Planning professionals participated in the process mainly as mediators who helped guide participatory sessions and facilitated the consensus-building process.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Between 20, 000 and 30, 000 residents participated directly in the NPP.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  The program has been recognized as a successful example of communicative planning and [[collaborative governance]] due to the high level of participation and the frequency with which consensus was genuinely reached.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==  Challenges and critiques ==
Critiques of Innes, Healey, and communicative planning focus on the planning processes and outcomes.

Older critiques of communicative planning theory question whether the theory they find idealist can translate a consensus-based process into authentic outcomes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tewdwr-Jones|first=M.|last2=Allmendinger|first2=P.|date=1998-11-01|title=Deconstructing Communicative Rationality: A Critique of Habermasian Collaborative Planning|url=http://epn.sagepub.com/content/30/11/1975|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=30|issue=11|pages=1975–1989|doi=10.1068/a301975|issn=0308-518X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also question whether consensus is a valuable goal when they see critical planning decisions as being made gradually.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=aetrlrhK37sC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=rationality+and+power&amp;ots=a7lj21LT2d&amp;sig=0_-GsZZkld1rJoEsk3Ui8Y_pT4s#v=onepage&amp;q=rationality%20and%20power&amp;f=false|title=Rationality and Power: Democracy in Practice|last=Flyvbjerg|first=Bent|date=1998-02-28|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226254494|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional critiques relate to power: who has the power to exclude and include stakeholders and whether stakeholders will use their power to manipulate the consensus building process (given that consensus must be reached).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Older critiques of communicative planning practice also see a lack of real world outcomes from the communicative planning processes because deeper political and institutional change is needed first.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Judith Innes directly responded to these critiques in her article ''Consensus Building: Clarifications for the Critics''.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Innes|first=Judith E.|date=2004-03-01|title=Consensus Building: Clarifications for the Critics|url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/3/1/5|journal=Planning Theory|language=en|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5–20|doi=10.1177/1473095204042315|issn=1473-0952}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, she expanded her description of the consensus building process and communicative planning's roots.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Newer [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] critiques argue collaborative planning is a way to maintain larger political and institutional systems while creating a process that only seems to better represent the public.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=Mark|date=2009-05-01|title=Resisting Neoliberalization: Communicative Planning or Counter-Hegemonic Movements?|url=http://plt.sagepub.com/content/8/2/140|journal=Planning Theory|language=en|volume=8|issue=2|pages=140–165|doi=10.1177/1473095209102232|issn=1473-0952}}&lt;/ref&gt; They see collaborative planning as a way to keep neoliberals in power and political systems stable, rather than creating real changes to the governing system.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''computational problem''' is a [[mathematical object]] representing a collection of questions that [[computers]] might be able to solve.  For example, the problem of '''factoring'''

:"Given a positive integer ''n'', find a nontrivial prime factor of ''n''." 

is a computational problem.  Computational problems are one of the main objects of study in theoretical computer science.  The field of [[algorithms]] studies methods of solving computational problems efficiently.  The complementary field of [[computational complexity]] attempts to explain why certain computational problems are intractable for computers.

A computational problem can be viewed as an infinite collection of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for every instance.  For example, in the factoring problem, the instances are the integers ''n'', and solutions are prime numbers ''p'' that describe nontrivial prime factors of ''n''.  

It is conventional to represent both instances and solutions by binary [[String (computer science)|strings]], namely elements of {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. For example, numbers can be represented as binary strings using the binary encoding. (For readability, we identify numbers with their binary encodings in the examples below.)

==Types of computational problems==
A [[decision problem]] is a computational problem where the answer for every instance is either yes or no. An example of a decision problem is ''[[primality testing]]'':

:"Given a positive integer ''n'', determine if ''n'' is prime." 

A decision problem is typically represented as the set of all instances for which the answer is ''yes''. For example, primality testing can be represented as the infinite set

:''L'' = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...}

In a [[search problem]], the answers can be arbitrary strings. For example, factoring is a search problem where the instances are (string representations of) positive integers and the solutions are (string representations of) collections of primes.

A search problem is represented as a [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] consisting of all the instance-solution pairs, called a ''search relation''. For example, factoring can be represented as the relation

:''R'' = {(4, 2), (6, 2), (6, 3), (8, 2), (9, 3), (10, 2), (10, 5)...}

which consist of all pairs of numbers (''n'', ''p''), where ''p'' is a nontrivial prime factor of ''n''.

A [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]] asks for the number of solutions to a given search problem. For example, a counting problem associated with factoring is

:"Given a positive integer ''n'', count the number of nontrivial prime factors of ''n''."

A counting problem can be represented by a function ''f'' from {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to the nonnegative integers. For a search relation ''R'', the counting problem associated to ''R'' is the function

:''f&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''(x) = |{''y'': ''R''(''x'', ''y'') }|.

An [[optimization problem]] asks for finding a "best possible" solution among the set of all possible solutions to a search problem. One example is the ''[[Maximum independent set problem|maximum independent set]]'' problem:

:"Given a graph ''G'', find an [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] of ''G'' of maximum size."

Optimization problems can be represented by their search relations.

In a [[function problem]] a single output (of a [[total function]]) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a [[decision problem]], that is, it isn't just "yes" or "no". One of the most famous examples is the ''[[Travelling salesman problem|travelling salesman]]'' problem:

:"Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city."

It is an [[NP-hard]] problem in [[combinatorial optimization]], important in [[operations research]] and [[theoretical computer science]].

==Promise problem==
{{Main|Promise problem}}

In [[computational complexity theory]], it is usually implicitly assumed that any string in {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; represents an instance of the computational problem in question. However, sometimes not all strings {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; represent valid instances, and one specifies a proper subset of {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; as the set of "valid instances".  Computational problems of this type are called [[promise problem]]s.

The following is an example of a (decision) promise problem:

:"Given a graph ''G'', determine if every [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]] in ''G'' has size at most 5, or ''G'' has an independent set of size at least 10."

Here, the valid instances are those graphs whose maximum independent set size is either at most 5 or at least 10.

Decision promise problems are usually represented as pairs of disjoint subsets (''L''&lt;sub&gt;yes&lt;/sub&gt;, ''L''&lt;sub&gt;no&lt;/sub&gt;) of {0, 1}&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. The valid instances are those in ''L''&lt;sub&gt;yes&lt;/sub&gt; ∪ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;no&lt;/sub&gt;.
''L''&lt;sub&gt;yes&lt;/sub&gt; and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;no&lt;/sub&gt; represent the instances whose answer is ''yes'' and ''no'', respectively.  

Promise problems play an important role in several areas of [[Analysis of algorithms|computational complexity]], including [[hardness of approximation]], [[property testing]], and [[interactive proof system]]s.

The '''Crespi effect''' is a [[Behavioral contrast|behavioural contrast]] phenomenon first observed in rats by US [[psychologist]] [[Leo P. Crespi]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crespi|first=Leo P.|date=1942|title=Quantitative Variation of Incentive and Performance in the White Rat|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1417120|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|volume=55|issue=4|pages=467–517|doi=10.2307/1417120}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that in a repeatedly carried out task such as finding food in a maze, the running speed of the rat is proportional to the size of the reward it obtained on the previous trial. The more food reward that was given to it last time upon completion of the task, the faster it will run when attempting to complete the same task. The effect also works in reverse: when rats were shifted from a larger to a smaller reward, they ran more slowly than the control rats that had always received the small reward.

It is important to note that the size of the reward has little or no influence on the speed of [[learning]], but that it does have an influence on the performance of tasks already learned.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8061">'''Deculturalization''' is the process by which an ethnic group is forced to abandon its language, culture, and customs. It is the destruction of the culture of a dominated group and its replacement by the culture of the dominating group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Branch|first1=André J|title=Deculturalization|url=http://knowledge.sagepub.com/view/diversityineducation/n190.xml|website=SAGE knowledge|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc|accessdate=9 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deculturalization is a slow process due to its extensive goal of fully replacing the subordinate ethnic group's culture, language, and customs. This term is often confused with [[Assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]] and [[acculturation]].

==Methods of Deculturalization==
* [[Geographical segregation]]
* Forbidding education to the dominated group

* Instructors are from the dominant group
* Avoiding the dominated group's culture in curriculum

==Deculturalization in the United States==
'''African Americans'''
The enslavement of African Americans during the 18th and 19th centuries in the United States is a form of deculturalization. [[Slavery in the United States]] made the African Americans dependent on their owners allowing for the owners to exploit them. The owners removed their African names, did not allow them to read, and did not allow them to practice their culture and language. Deculturalization of African Americans stems back to When the African American slaves were forbidden access to education due to fear of a slave revolt against the slaveholders.&lt;ref&gt;http://h637-books.wikispaces.com/Deculturalization+and+the+Struggle+for+Equality&lt;/ref&gt; A series of court cases occurred in the United States helping deculturalization of African Americans as wells as there were cases that went against deculturalization. For example, the addition of the [[14th Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford]] decision, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], [[Plessy v. Ferguson]], and countless others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/ukhxfexpakmq/deculturalization-of-education/|title=Deculturalization of Education|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Civil War (United States)]] segregated education continued and was a struggle to integrate fully and completely. While integration was achieved, the textbooks that the African American students learn from are bias and contain material from the dominant, Anglo-American culture.

'''Latin Americans'''
The deculturalization of Latinos can refer back to the Mexican–American War and [[The Treaty Of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. Once the United States won California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Utah, and parts of Wyoming and Colorado Mexicans who were living in these areas were removed from their lands. Their identity in the United States changed constantly from Mexican to White and vice versa until the word Hispanic was created to refer to these Mexican Americans. By simply using the word Hispanic to refer to the Mexican Americans and later the Latin-American immigrants refers to the conqueror's culture-the Spanish culture. Latin@ in the United States also had segregated schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/latino/latinothemestudy/education.htm|title=Demanding their Rights: The Latino Struggle for Educational Access and Equity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools they were given second-hand material from the wealthy, Anglo schools. When Latinos were being integrated, they as well as the African Americans, were being taught from bias, Anglo-cultured, Anglo-praising textbooks. Latinos did have a win to have bilingual education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civilrights.org/resources/civilrights101/desegregation.html|title=School Desegregation and Equal Educational Opportunity|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they were allowed to have bilinugal education, the primary, enforced language is the English one. In some schools Latinos were corporally punished for speaking Spanish in the classroom. In some Universities, Latinos were also forced to take many speech classes in order to remove the accents of the Latinos when they spoke English.&lt;ref&gt;http://wolfweb.unr.edu/homepage/calabj/282/how%20to%20tame%20wild%20tongue.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While that is not seen evidently in schools anymore, the education system continues to enforce English, Anglo-American customs, culture and language as the dominant one.

'''Asian Americans'''
Asian Americans began to be deculturalized by not being allowed to be naturalized, the Chinese-Exclusion Act, Japanese Internment, forbidding land ownership, and enforcing the Anglo-culture onto them. The [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] did not allow for the Chinese along with other Asians to become naturalized, because the naturalization process was limited only to the Anglo community in the United States.&lt;ref name="ecaasu.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecaasu.org/site/important-dates-in-asian-american-history/|title=Important Dates in Asian American History - East Coast Asian American Student Union|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of schooling, in some cases Asian Americans were denied an education entirely. It was not until the 1900s when Asian Americans were allowed to receive an education through the implementation of certain provisions. In 1855, the Chan Yong case fortified that the Chinese are not "white" therefore ineligible for citizenship due to the Naturalization Act of 1790.&lt;ref&gt;http://academic.evergreen.edu/curricular/mit2005/Winter/History/RacismTimelin2.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1922, the court case Ozawa v. United States, the Japanese man understood he was not allowed to be naturalized due to the former act, but asked for the Japanese to be considered white, but was denied the request.&lt;ref name="ecaasu.org"/&gt; The Ozawa v. United States shows how some Asians would rather refer to themselves as white than as Japanese or their individual ethnic group, because of the advantages that being "white" bring. The enforced Anglo-American culture upon the Asians and using them during the Cold War as a model minority that the United States is not racist, it is the individual's fault allows for deculturalization to be successful. [[Jade Snow Wong]] is a Chinese-American writer who was used by the American government to travel to the Asian world and show how an Asian can succeed in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1790878/_Americas_Chinese_Anti-Communism_Citizenship_and_Cultural_Diplomacy_During_the_Cold_War|title="America's Chinese": Anti-Communism, Citizenship, and Cultural Diplomacy During the Cold War|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pre-Americans'''
Once the first settlement in Jamestown 1607 occurred, the Pre-American deculturalization process began. When the English came to America they looked to the Native Americans as "pagans" and "savages". Native Americans believed that the land was not property, a thing to be claimed and owned. Once the English settlers arrived this was one of the major culture difference that needed to be extinguished. The idea of private property and ownership was enforced upon the Native Americans. While even those who accepted it, because they understood the consequences, their lands were taken away. They wanted to impose the traditional "Christian" nuclear family as well among the Native Americans. In order to gain success the colonists made Native American Educational Programs. Christian missionaries such as John Eliot learned the Native American language in order to convert them into Christianity began the segregation among the "pagans" and the "holy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/11onrwncpstw/deculturalization-theory/|title=Deculturalization Theory|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Native Americans were exploited. There was a cultural genocide and simply genocide against the Native Americans. From the Trail of Tears to the appropriation of their designs in order to gain capital, corporate gains.

[[Image:DiffSignaling.png|thumb|upright=1.3|right|Elimination of noise by using differential signaling.]]

'''Differential signaling''' is a method for electrically transmitting [[information]] using two complementary [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]]. The technique sends the same electrical signal as a ''differential pair'' of signals, each in its own conductor. The pair of conductors can be wires (typically twisted together) or traces on a circuit board. The receiving circuit responds to the electrical difference between the two signals, rather than the difference between a single wire and [[Ground (electricity)|ground]]. The opposite technique is called [[single-ended signaling]].
Differential pairs are usually found on [[printed circuit board]]s, in [[twisted-pair]] and [[ribbon cable]]s, and in connectors.

==Advantages==
Provided that the source and receiver impedances in the differential signaling circuit are equal, external electromagnetic interference tends to affect both conductors identically. Since the receiving circuit only detects the difference between the wires, the technique resists [[Electromagnetic interference|electromagnetic noise]] compared to one conductor with an un-paired reference (ground).  The technique works for both analog signaling, as in [[balanced audio]]—and digital signaling, as in [[RS-422]], [[RS-485]], [[Ethernet over twisted pair]], [[PCI Express]], [[DisplayPort]], [[HDMI]], and [[USB]].

=== Ground offset tolerance ===
[[Image:Differential Signaling.svg|thumb|500px|right|In a system with a differential receiver, desired signals add and noise is subtracted away.]]

=== Suitability for use with low-voltage electronics ===
The electronics industry, particularly in portable and mobile devices, continually strives to lower supply voltage to save power and reduce emitted electromagnetic radiation.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} A low supply voltage, however, reduces noise immunity. Differential signaling helps to reduce these problems because, for a given supply voltage, it provides twice the noise immunity of a single-ended system.

To see why, consider a single-ended digital system with supply voltage &lt;math&gt;V_S&lt;/math&gt;. The high logic level is &lt;math&gt;V_S\,&lt;/math&gt; and the low logic level is 0 V. The difference between the two levels is therefore &lt;math&gt;V_S - 0\,\mathrm{V} = V_S&lt;/math&gt;. Now consider a differential system with the same supply voltage. The voltage difference in the high state, where one wire is at &lt;math&gt;V_S\,&lt;/math&gt; and the other at 0 V, is &lt;math&gt;V_S - 0\,\mathrm{V} = V_S&lt;/math&gt;. The voltage difference in the low state, where the voltages on the wires are exchanged, is &lt;math&gt;0\,\mathrm{V} - V_S = -V_S&lt;/math&gt;.  The difference between high and low logic levels is therefore &lt;math&gt;V_S - (-V_S) = 2V_S\,&lt;/math&gt;. This is twice the difference of the single-ended system. If the voltage noise on one wire is uncorrelated to the noise on the other one, it takes twice as much noise to cause an error with the differential system as with the single-ended system. In other words, differential signalling doubles the noise immunity.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

=== Resistance to electromagnetic interference ===
This advantage is not directly due to differential signaling itself, but to the common practice of transmitting differential signals on [[balanced line]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Single-ended signals are still resistant to interference if the lines are balanced and terminated by a differential amplifier.

== Comparison with single-ended signaling ==
In single-ended signaling, the transmitter generates a single voltage that the receiver compares with a fixed reference voltage, both relative to a common ground connection shared by both ends. In many instances single-ended designs are not feasible. Another difficulty is the electromagnetic interference that can be generated by a single-ended signaling system that attempts to operate at high speed.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Uses==
The technique minimizes [[crosstalk (electronics)|electronic crosstalk]] and [[electromagnetic interference]], both [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] emission and noise acceptance, and can achieve a constant or known [[characteristic impedance]], allowing [[impedance matching]] techniques important in a high-speed signal [[transmission line]] or high quality [[balanced line]] and [[balanced circuit]] audio signal path.

Differential pairs include:
* [[twisted-pair]] cables, [[shielded cable|shielded]] and unshielded
* [[microstrip]] and [[stripline]] differential pair routing techniques on [[printed circuit board]]s

Differential pairs generally carry differential or semi-differential signals, such as high-speed digital serial interfaces including [[LVDS]] differential [[Emitter coupled logic|ECL]], [[Positive Referenced Emitter Coupled Logic|PECL]], [[Low Voltage Positive Emitter Coupled Logic|LVPECL]], [[Hypertransport]], [[Ethernet over twisted pair]], [[Serial Digital Interface]], [[RS-422]], [[RS-485]], [[USB]], [[Serial ATA]], [[TMDS]], [[FireWire]], and [[HDMI]] etc. or else high quality and/or high frequency analog signals (e.g., [[video signal]]s, [[balanced audio]] signals, etc.).

=== Data rates of some interfaces implemented with differential pairs ===
* [[Serial ATA]] 1.5 Gbit/s
* [[Hypertransport]] 1.6 Gbit/s
* [[Infiniband]] 2.5 Gbit/s
* [[PCI Express]] 2.5 Gbit/s
* [[Serial ATA#2.0|Serial ATA Revision 2.0]] 2.4 Gbit/s
* [[XAUI]] 3.125 Gbit/s
* [[Serial ATA#3.0|Serial ATA Revision 3.0]] 6 Gbit/s
* [[PCI Express 2.0]] 5.0 Gbit/s per lane
* [[10 Gigabit Ethernet]] 10 Gbit/s (4 differential pairs running at 2.5 Gbit/s each)
* [[DDR SDRAM]]  3.2 Gbit/s (differential strobes latch single-ended data)

== Transmission lines ==
The type of transmission line that connects two devices (chips, modules) dictates the type of signaling. Single-ended signaling is used with [[coaxial cable]]s, in which one conductor totally screens the other from the environment. All screens (or shields) are combined into a single piece of material to form a common ground. Differential signaling is used with a balanced pair of conductors. For short cables and low frequencies, the two methods are equivalent, so cheap single-ended circuits with a common ground can be used with cheap cables. As signaling speeds become faster, wires begin to behave as [[transmission line]]s.

== Use in computers ==
Differential signaling is often used in computers to reduce [[electromagnetic interference]], because complete screening is not possible with [[microstrip]]s and [[Microprocessor|chips]] in computers, due to geometric constraints and the fact that screening does not work at DC. If a DC power supply line and a low-voltage signal line share the same ground, the power current returning through the ground can induce a significant voltage in it. A low-resistance ground reduces this problem to some extent. A balanced pair of microstrip lines is a convenient solution, because it does not need an additional PCB layer, as a [[stripline]] does. Because each line causes a matching image current in the ground plane, which is required anyway for supplying power, the pair looks like four lines and therefore has a shorter crosstalk distance than a simple isolated pair. In fact, it behaves as well as a twisted pair. Low crosstalk is important when many lines are packed into a small space, as on a typical PCB.

== High-voltage differential signaling ==
&lt;!-- [[High-voltage differential signaling]] redirects to this section --&gt;
'''High-voltage differential (HVD) signaling''' uses high-[[voltage]] signals. In [[computer]] electronics, "high voltage" normally means 5 volts or more.

SCSI-1 variations included a high voltage differential (HVD) implementation whose maximum cable length was many times that of the single-ended version. [[SCSI]] equipment for example allows a maximum total cable length of 25 meters using HVD, while single-ended SCSI allows a maximum cable length of 1.5 to 6 meters, depending on bus speed. LVD versions of SCSI allow less than 25 m cable length not because of the lower voltage, but because these SCSI standards allow much higher speeds than the older HVD SCSI.

The generic term ''High-voltage differential signaling'' describes a variety of systems.  ''Low-voltage differential signaling'' or [[LVDS]], on the other hand, is a specific system defined by a TIA/EIA standard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14663">The '''Engineering, Science, and Management War Training''' program ('''ESMWT''') was one of the largest and most productive educational activities in America's history. It was perhaps only second to the [[G.I. Bill]] (officially the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944) in its scope and productivity.

Sometimes referred to as an "experiment in streamlined higher education", this government-sponsored program provided, without charge, college-grade courses for large numbers of Americans to fill urgently needed technical and scientific civilian positions just prior to and during World War II. College-grade was officially defined as "work of an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students."

With successive designations of Engineering Defense Training (EDT), Engineering, Science, and Management Defense Training (ESMDT), and ESMWT, the program was operated by the U.S. Office of Education from October 1940 through June 1945, with 227 colleges and universities providing about 68,000 courses for close to 1,800,000 students at a total cost of some $60 million ($940 million today's dollars).&lt;ref&gt;Cardozier, V.

In mid-1940, before America officially entered World War II, it was brought to the attention of [[U.S. Congress]] that the civilian effort supporting the expected conflict would require far more engineers than were then available or could be produced through normal programs at colleges and universities. As part of the budget preparation, Congress tasked [[John W. Studebaker]], then [[U.S. Commissioner of Education]] and head of the [[Office of Education]] (predecessor of the [[United States Department of Education]]), to develop a program to help alleviate this crisis.

Studebaker asked Andrey A. Potter, Dean of Engineering at [[Purdue University]], to assist in developing this program and in  preparing a proposal to Congress.  A National Advisory Committee – composed of academic leaders and industry officials – first met on September 20–21, 1940. On October 9, a bill authoring the Engineering Defense Training (EDT) program with initial funding of $9 million (equivalent to $138 million in 2008) was passed by Congress and quickly signed by President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

The bill authorized the Office of Education to contract with engineering schools throughout the U.S. to offer "intensive courses of college grade, designed to meet the shortage of engineers in activities essential to national defense."  Roy A. Seaton, Dean of Engineering at [[Kansas State College]], was appointed to direct the program.  Twenty-two regional advisors, each a prominent engineering educator, served without pay as coordinators. 

Courses under the EDT program began on December 9, 1940.  During the remainder of the Fiscal Year ending June 30, 1941, about 120,800 individuals enrolled in 2,260 courses offered by 144 institutions.  

In July 1941, the Labor-Federal Security Appropriations Act, authorized the addition of chemistry, physics, and production-related courses to form an integrated ESMDT program. Funding was increased to $17.5 million ($270 million equivalent in 2008), and Dean George W. Case from the University of New Hampshire, replaced Seaton as the program director. During the next year, enrollment increased to nearly 450,000 men and women in about 7,800 courses offered by 196 colleges and universities. 

After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] (December 7, 1941) and the entry of the U.S. into World War II, the War-Time Commission was formed within the Department of Education to be responsible for this and other special training activities. The program was again renamed, becoming ESMWT, and continued as such through June 1945.  The annual enrollment in ESMWT averaged nearly 600,000 in some 13,000 courses.  Ultimately, 215 colleges and universities participated, with the offerings given in more than 1,000 towns and cities.

==Courses and academic credit==

The primary objective of the program was to prepare persons for professional positions in defense activities. The authorization required the courses to be of "an academic standard customarily demanded of engineering-school students", distinguishing them from offerings of trade or technical schools. They were limited to engineering, physics, chemistry, and management subjects directly needed in defense activities

It is noted that many of the ESMWT courses, although of "college grade" at that time, might not be recognized as such in engineering and science programs today. At most colleges and universities in the early 1940s, engineering education greatly emphasized practical applications as opposed to theoretical analysis. It was somewhat the same in many undergraduate physics and chemistry programs.

Although there might be progressively higher-level courses in a subject, each ESMWT course was to be complete in itself and designed to convey some stated, applicable knowledge set. While prerequisites were listed for courses, these were mainly to indicate the background needed to understand the subject matter, and the pursuit of a course was not limited to persons having these prerequisites.

The participating colleges and universities were fully responsible for determining the local needs and developing courses to meet these needs. The relationship of these courses to the regular courses in a degree program was also under the responsibility of the offering institution.

Regular faculty members taught most of the courses. Although requiring considerable preparation, this was welcome work for most professors; between the draft and volunteering, college enrollment was a small fraction of normal. Some courses required instructors to have a highly specialized knowledge, and practitioners from industry were then used.

The matter of granting academic course credit for the special courses was an issue from the beginning. The Office of Education recommended against academic credit, reasioning that since the courses were paid by the government, this might "constitute a Federal subsidy to the participating college", a forbidden practice in that day. It was recommended, however, that knowledge of a subject gained through these courses be recognized, by examination or otherwise, for students in regular college programs, allowing them to excused from that subject, with or without credit.  

The Engineers’ Council for Professional Development (ECPD), then the accrediting body for engineering programs and predecessor of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET), also had reservations concerning academic credit. Following much debate, it was left to each school to make any credit-related decisions and, in the end, most decided against directly granting academic credit, primarily citing the imbalance of applications over theory in most ESMWT courses.

After being prepared by the offering institution, course outlines, schedules, and other information were submitted to the ESMWT Washington staff for approval, and the cognizant school was required to permanently maintain the same type of records on presented courses as those kept in regular academic programs.

==Students and recognition==

By law, admission to ESMWT courses was open to students without regard to age, sex, or race. With this, and without enforcement of prerequisites, there was a great diversity of students in the various offerings. It was not uncommon to find students in their early teens using the ESMWT program to accelerate their entry into engineering and science jobs. On the other end of the age spectrum, many of the students were in mid-life, preparing for a change of work field or refreshing their earlier education.

Perhaps the greatest diversity was in the number of female students. Prior to the 1940s, there were few women working in industry science and even less in engineering. The entry of women into defense jobs is well known through "[[Rosie the Riveter]]", but those in wartime engineering and related work are not often recognized; however, thousands entered professional work after being prepared through this program.

Under the initial EDT, women constituted less than 1 percent. With the addition of science and management courses, there were about 9 percent under ESMDT. After the start of the war and ESMWT, the numbers participating in the program increased to 22 percent. Many engineering schools that had earlier been all-male, first accepted women when they began the program. Conversely, a number of previously female colleges – including [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Skidmore College]], and [[Wellesley College]] – participated in the program and had their first male students. (Some of these schools later reverted to all-female).

Throughout the program, about 75 percent of the enrollments were in engineering subjects. After a series of courses in a particular subject area, many of the students, especially those having an earlier background in science and/or mathematics, were placed in regular engineering positions with industry or government agencies. These were sometimes referred to as "instant engineers." A 1950 survey of practicing engineers found that there were many more than the sum of those in 1940 plus those graduating from engineering colleges in the 1940-50 decade; much of this difference was attributed to persons who gained this classification through the ESMWT program.

Many schools considered graduation from ESMWT courses to have great significance. As an example, at [[North Carolina State University]] the Chancellor often personally awarded certificates to the graduates. 
 
The Office of Education requirements were that students of any race would be admitted to ESMDT courses. Unfortunately, African-Americans were not well represented either in the participating institutions or as students. [[Howard University]] did have a relatively large program for the District of Columbia area; this was led by Herman R. Branson of the Physics Department who had a distinguished post-war career in academia.

==Noteworthy offerings==

From June 23 to August 29, 1941,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | accessdate=2010-12-04| title=Mauchly Papers at Penn Library | url=http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/mauchly/img/course.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt; electrical engineering student [[J. Presper Eckert]] assisted in teaching a 10-week ESMDT course in electronics at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s [[Moore School of Electrical Engineering]]. The course had 30 students, 16 of whom held Ph.D. degrees. Among the students was [[John W. Mauchly]]. Eckert and Mauchly then teamed in developing the Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer ([[ENIAC]]), America's first large-scale digital computer.

Courses in industrial chemistry and metallurgy were in great demand. Harry J. Sweeney, then Chief Metallurgist for the giant [[Republic Steel]], stated, "I don’t know what we would have done without the ESMDT courses; about 75 percent of our new professionals were trained through this program."

Aircraft played a vital role in World War II. During 1940, [[Cornell University]] started courses in aircraft structures and stress analysis at [[Buffalo, New York]], for [[Bell Aircraft]] and [[Curtis Wright]]. One of these, starting December 9, was the first EDT-sponsored course in the U.S. By the end of the first year, more than 800 students were attending these classes.

In 1941, the [[University of Texas]] started a series of ESMDT courses in aeronautical engineering. These were so successful that the next year a full Department of Aeronautical Engineering was formed. For the aircraft industries of Los Angeles, Maurice J. Zucrow of [[University of California, Los Angeles]], taught ESMWT courses on [[jet propulsion]] and [[gas turbines]], introducing hundreds of aeronautical engineers to this critical technology of post-war propulsion.

Across the nation, some of the most attended courses were in electronics and radio communications. [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Harvard University]], [[Tufts College]], [[Northeastern University]], [[Boston University]], and [[Boston College]] joined forces to offer the ESMDT/ESMWT program; Dean Edward L. Moreland of MIT served as the coordinator. Much of it was in support of the [[Radiation Laboratory]] at MIT where microwave radar was being developed and the electronics firms in the northeast area.

[[Rutgers University]] was one of the few participants that included labor-management courses in its ESMWT offerings. These brought workers to the Rutgers campus in unprecedented numbers. The coordinator, Norman C. Miller stated, "The spirit of patriotism, sacrifice, and co-operation that imbued both labor and management in service to the war effort was clearly evident in these courses." This effort carried into the post-war era with the establishment of the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Rutgers,

'''Epoxide docosapentaenoic acids''' ('''epoxydocosapentaenoic acids''', '''EDPs''', or '''EpDPEs''') are metabolites of the 22-carbon straight-chain [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[docosahexaenoic acid]] (DHA).  Cell types that express certain cytochrome P450 (CYP) [[epoxygenase]]s metabolize [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]'s (PUFAs) by converting one of their double bonds to an [[epoxide]].  In the best known of these metabolic pathways, cellular CYP epoxygenases metabolize the 20-carbon straight-chain [[omega-6 fatty acid]], [[arachidonic acid]], to [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s (EETs); another CYP epoxygenase pathway metabolizes the  20-carbon omega-3 fatty acid, [[eicosapentaenoic acid]] (EPA), to [[epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid]]s (EEQs). CYP epoxygenases similarly convert various other PUFAs to epoxides (see [[epoxygenase]]) These epoxide metabolites have a variety of activities.  However, essentially all of them are rapidly converted to their corresponding, but in general far less active, [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] dihydroxy fatty acids by ubiquitous cellular [[Soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH; also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2).  Consequently, these epoxides, including EDPs, operate as short-lived signaling agents that regulate the function of their parent or nearby cells.  The particular feature of EDPs (and EEQs) distinguishing them from EETs is that they derive from omega-3 fatty acids and are suggested to be responsible for some of the  beneficial effects attributed to omega-3 fatty acids and omega-3-rich foods such as [[fish oil]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25244930 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The pharmacology of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase axis in the vasculature and cardiovascular disease | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 1106–40 | doi = 10.1124/pr.113.007781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
EDPs are [[epoxide]] eicosapentaenoic acid metabolites of DHA.  DHA has 6 cis (see [[Cis–trans isomerism]]) [[Double bond]]s each one of which is located between carbons 4-5, 7-8, 10-11, 13-14, 16-17, or 19-20. Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases attack any one of these double bounds to form a respective docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) epoxide regioisomer (see [[Structural isomer]], section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)).  A given epoxygenase may therefore convert DHA to 4,5-EDP (i.e. 4,5-epoxy-7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 7,8-EDP (i.e. 7,8-epoxy-4''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 10,11-EDP (i.e. 10,11-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 13,14-EDP (i.e. 13,14-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',16''Z'',19''Z''-DPA), 16,17-EDP (i.e. 16,17-epoxy-4''Z'',7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',19''Z''-DPA, or 19,20-EDP (i.e. 19,20-epoxy-4''Z'', 7''Z'',10''Z'',13''Z'',16''Z''-DPA. The epoxygenase enzymes generally form both ''R''/''S'' [[enantiomers]] at each former double bound position; for example, cytochrome P450 epoxidases attack DHA at the 16,17-double bond position to form two epoxide enantiomers, 16''R'',17''S''-EDP and 16''S'',17''S''-EDP.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25093613 | pmc = 4314516 | year = 2015 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A.

==Production==
Enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) superfamily that are classified as epoxygenases based on their ability to metabolize PUFA, particularly arachidonic acid, to epoxides include: CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, CYP2J, and within the CYP3A subfamily, CYP3A4. In humans, [[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2J2]], and possibly [[CYP2S1]] [[isoforms]] appear to be the principal epoxygenases responsible for metabolizing arachidonic acid to EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Production]]).  In general, these same CYP epoxygenases also metabolize DHA to EDP (as well as EPA to EEQ; CYP2S1 has not yet been tested for DHA-metabolizing ability), doing so at rates that are often greater than their rates in metabolizing arachidonic acid to EETs; that is, DHA (and EPA) appear to be preferred over arachidonic acid as substrates for many of the CYP epoxygenases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25330284 | year = 2015 | author1 = Frömel | first1 = T | title = Whatever happened to the epoxyeicosatrienoic Acid-like endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor?

The EDPs are commonly made by the stimulation of specific cell types by the same mechanisms which produce EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]).  That is, cell stimulation causes DHA to be released from the ''sn-2'' position of their membrane-bound cellular [[phospholipid]] pools through the action of a [[Phospholipase A2]]-type enzyme and the subsequent attack of the released DHA by CYP450 epoxidases. It is notable that the consumption of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets dramatically raises the serum and tissue levels of EDPs and EEQs in animals as well as humans.  Indeed, this rise in EDP (and EEQ) levels in humans is by far the most prominent change in the profile of PUFA metabolites caused by dietary omega-3 fatty acids and, it is suggested, may be responsible for at least some of the beneficial effects ascribed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Lipid Res 1164"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24634501 | pmc = 4031946 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fischer | first1 = R | title = Dietary omega-3 fatty acids modulate the eicosanoid profile in man primarily via the CYP-epoxygenase pathway | journal = The Journal of Lipid Research | volume = 55 | issue = 6 | pages = 1150–1164 | last2 = Konkel | first2 = A | last3 = Mehling | first3 = H | last4 = Blossey | first4 = K | last5 = Gapelyuk | first5 = A | last6 = Wessel | first6 = N | last7 = von Schacky | first7 = C | last8 = Dechend | first8 = R | last9 = Muller | first9 = D.

==EDP metabolism==
Similar to EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), EDPs are rapidly metabolized in cells by a cytosolic [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] (sEH, also termed Epoxide hydrolase 2 [EC 3.2.2.10.]) to form their corresponding [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] [[diol]] dihydroxyeicosapentaenoic acids. Thus, sEH converts 19,20-EDP to 19,10-dihdroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DPA), 16,17-EDP to 16,17-dihydroxy-DPA, 13,14-EDP to 13,14-dihydroxy-DPA, 10,11-EDP to 10,11-dihydroxy-DPA, and 7,8-EDP to 7,8-dihydroxy-EDP; 4,5-EDP is unstable and therefore generally not detected in cells.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23701967 | pmc = 3733540 | year = 2013 | author1 = Harris | first1 = T. R. | title = Soluble epoxide hydrolase: Gene structure, expression and deletion | journal = Gene | volume = 526 | issue = 2 | pages = 61–74 | last2 = Hammock | first2 = B. D. | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dihydroxy-EDP products, like their epoxy precursors, are [[enantiomer]] mixtures; for instance, sEH converts 16,17-EDP to a mixture of 16(''S''),17(''R'')-dihydroxy-DPA and 16(''R''),1y(''S'')-dihydroxy-DPA.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt; These dihydroxy-DPAs typically are far less active than their epoxide precursors.  The sEH pathway acts rapidly and is by far the predominant pathway of EDP inactivation; its operation causes EDPs to function as short-lived mediators whose actions are limited to their parent and nearby cells, i.e. they are [[autocrine]] and [[paracrine]] signaling agents, respectively.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23011468 | year = 2013 | author1 = Bellien | first1 = J | title = Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid pathway in human health and diseases | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 188–96 | last2 = Joannides | first2 = R | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318273b007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26621325 | year = 2016 | author1 = He | first1 = J | title = Soluble epoxide hydrolase: A potential target for metabolic diseases | journal = Journal of Diabetes | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 305–13 | last2 = Wang | first2 = C | last3 = Zhu | first3 = Y | last4 = Ai | first4 = D | doi = 10.1111/1753-0407.12358 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the sEH pathway, EDPs, similar to the EETs, may be acylated into phospholipids in an [[Acylation]]-like reaction; this pathway may serve to limit the action of EETs or store them for future release.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  Finally, again similar to the EETs, EDPs are subject to inactivation by being further metabolized b [[Beta oxidation]].&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25240260 | pmc = 4254344 | year = 2014 | author1 = Wagner | first1 = K | title = The role of long chain fatty acids and their epoxide metabolites in nociceptive signaling | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 113-115 | pages = 2–12 | last2 = Vito | first2 = S | last3 = Inceoglu | first3 = B | last4 = Hammock | first4 = B. D. | doi = 10.1016/j.prostaglandins.2014.09.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical significance==
EDPs have not be studied nearly as well as the EETs.  This is particularly the case for animal studies into their potential clinical significance.  In comparison to a selection of the many activities attributed to the EETs (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), animal studies reported to date find that certain EDPs (16,17-EDP and 19,20-EDP have been most often examined) are: '''1)''' more potent than EETs in decreasing hypertension and pain perception; '''2)''' more potent than or at least equal in potency to the EETs in suppressing inflammation; and '''3)''' act oppositely from the EETs in that EDPs inhibit [[angiogenesis]], endothelial cell migration, endothelial cell proliferation, and the growth and metastasis of human breast and prostate cancer cell lines whereas EETs have stimulatory effects in each of these systems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prog Lipid Res 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt; As indicated in the Metabolism section, consumption of omega-3 fatty acid-rich diets dramatically raises the serum and tissue levels of EDPs and EEQs in animals as well as humans and in humans is by far the most prominent change in the profile of PUFA metabolites caused by dietary omega-3 fatty acids. Hence, the metabolism of DHA to EDPs (and EPA to EEQs) may be responsible for at least some of the beneficial effects ascribed to dietary omega-3 fatty acids.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J Lipid Res 1164"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt;

[[Image:FER.logo.jpg|thumb|200px|Official logo]]
The '''Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing''' ({{lang-hr|Fakultet elektrotehnike i računarstva}}, [[Abbreviation|abbr]]: ''FER'') is a [[faculty (division)|faculty]] of the [[University of Zagreb]]. It is the largest technical faculty and the leading educational as well as research-and-development institution in the fields of [[electrical engineering and computing]] in [[Croatia]].

FER owns four buildings situated in the [[Zagreb]] neighbourhood of Martinovka, [[Trnje]]. The total area of the site is {{convert|43308|m2|abbr=on}}. {{As of|2011}}, the Faculty employs more than 160 professors and 210 teaching and research assistants. In the academic year 2010/2011, the total number of students was about 3,800 in the undergraduate and graduate level, and about 450 in the PhD program.&lt;ref name="progressreport"&gt;[http://www.fer.unizg.hr/_download/repository/FER_-_Progress_Report_2009_-_2011.pdf FER Progress Report 2009-2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of school year 2004/2005, when the implementation of the [[Bologna process]] started at the University of Zagreb, the faculty has two [[baccalaureus]] programmes (each lasting 3 years):&lt;ref name="preddiplomski"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.fer.unizg.hr/en/education/bsc_study | title = About undergraduate (BSc) study programmes at FER | publisher = FER | accessdate = 2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Faculty comprises 12 [[academic department]]s:
* Applied Physics
* Applied Computing
* Applied Mathematics
* Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering and Measurements
* Electric Machines, Drives and Automation
* Power Systems
* Telecommunications
* Electronic Systems and Information Processing
* Control and Computer Engineering in Automation
* Electroacoustics

* Radiocommunications and Microwave Engineering

==History==
The Faculty of Electrical Engineering ({{lang-hr|Elektrotehnički fakultet}}, [[Abbreviation|abbr]]: ''ETF'') was formed on 1 July 1956 when the College of Engineering of the University of Zagreb was divided into ETF and three other new faculties. The faculty existed under this name until 7 February 1995 when it was renamed to its current name.

In 1956, the first curriculum was formed, offering students programme called "Study of Electrical Engineering". The faculty was divided into two departments, one for weak [[electric current|current]] (''Odjel za slabu struju'') and another for the strong current (''Odjel za jaku struju''). This was later referred to as the ETF-1 programme. The Faculty changed its curriculum in 1967, when the ETF-2 curriculum introduced a division of studies into electrical power systems, electronics, electrical machinery and automation. In 1970, the ETF-3 curriculum introduced further specializations, such as nuclear power systems and computing. There was also an ETF-4 curriculum later.

In 1994 name of the faculty changed, and the curriculum was changed from ETF-4 to FER-1. A separate study called "Study of Computing" was formed, so the faculty from then on offered two different degrees - one was the existing ''diplomirani inženjer elektrotehnike'', or [[engineer's degree|graduate engineer]] of electrical engineering, and the new one was ''diplomirani inženjer računarstva'', or [[engineer's degree|graduate engineer]] of computing. In 2004 FER-1 was transformed to FER-2, to conform to the [[Bologna process]]. This involved, among other things, changing the length of the essential course set from four semesters to two semesters, the renaming of the first study program to include the term [[information technology]], and the reworking of the program subdivisions so that they each include five specialized modules.

'''Female education in STEM''' includes child and adult [[female]] represented in the fields of [[science, technology, engineering, and mathematics]] (STEM ). In 2017, 33% of students in STEM fields were women.

The organization [[UNESCO]] has stated that this gender disparity is due to [[discrimination]], [[Bias|biases]], [[Norm (social)|social norms]] and expectations that influence the quality of [[education]] women receive and the subjects they study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; UNESCO also believes that having more women in STEM fields is desirable because it would help bring about [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0025/002534/253479e.pdf|title=Cracking the code: Girls' and womens' education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100233-5|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Overall trends in STEM education ===

Gender differences in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] education participation are already visible in [[Early childhood education|early childhood care and education]] in science- and math-related play, and become more pronounced at higher levels of [[education]]. Girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age, particularly between early and late adolescence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This decreased interest affects participation in advanced studies at the secondary level and in [[higher education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Female students represent 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields of study at this level globally &lt;!-- Needs clear source --&gt;. Differences are also observed by disciplines, with female enrollment lowest in engineering, manufacturing and construction, natural science, mathematics and statistics and ICT{{fix|text=what?}} fields. Significant regional and country differences in female representation in STEM studies can be observed, though, suggesting the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Women leave STEM disciplines in disproportionate numbers during their higher education studies, in their transition to the world of work and even in their career cycle.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/priority-areas/gender-and-science/improving-%20measurement-of-gender-equality-in-stem/stem-and-gender-advancement-saga/|title=STEM and Gender Advancement (SAGA) {{!}} United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization|website=www.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=PISA 2015 Results (Volume I): Excellence and Equity in Education|last=|first=|publisher=OECD|year=2016|isbn=|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timssandpirls.bc.edu/timss2015/international-results/advanced/|title=TIMSS ADVANCED 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT – TIMSS 2015 INTERNATIONAL RESULTS REPORT|website=timssandpirls.bc.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://data.uis.unesco.org/|title=UIS Statistics|last=UIS|website=data.uis.unesco.org|access-date=2017-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Engineering Indicators 2014|last=|first=|publisher=National Science Board|year=2014|isbn=|location=Arlington|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Learning achievement in STEM education ===
Data on gender differences in learning achievement present a complex picture, depending on what is measured (subject, knowledge acquisition against knowledge application), the level of education/age of students, and geographic location. Overall, women's participation has been increasing, but significant regional variations exist. For example, where data are available in [[Africa]], [[Latin America]] and the [[Caribbean]], the gender gap is largely in favour of boys in mathematics achievement in secondary education. In contrast, in the Arab States, girls perform better than boys in both subjects in primary and secondary education. As with the data on participation, national and regional variations in data on learning achievement suggest the presence of contextual factors affecting girls’ and women’s engagement in these fields. Girls’ achievement seems to be stronger in science than mathematics and where girls do better than boys, the score differential is up to three times higher than where boys do better.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} girls tend to outperform boys in certain sub-topics such as [[biology]] and [[chemistry]] but do less well in [[physics]] and [[earth science]].

The gender gap has fallen significantly in science in secondary education among [[Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study|TIMSS trend countries]]: 14 out of 17 participating countries had no gender gap in science in 2015, compared to only one in 1995. However, the data is less well known outside of these 17 countries. The gender gap in boys' favour is slightly bigger in mathematics but improvements over time in girls’ favour are also observed in certain countries, despite the important regional variations. Gender differences are observed within mathematic sub-topics with girls outperforming boys in topics such as [[algebra]] and [[geometry]] but doing less well in "number". Girls’ performance is stronger in assessments that measure knowledge acquisition than those measuring knowledge application. Country coverage in terms of data availability is quite limited while data is collected at different frequency and against different variables in the existing studies.

== Factors influencing girls' and women's participation and achievement in STEM education ==
[[File:Expectations of a ICT career, by gender (PISA 2015).svg|thumb|upright=2|According to [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] 2015 results 4.8% of boys and 0.4% of girls expect a ICT career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Catherine André/VoxEurop/EDJNet |author2=Marzia Bona/OBC Transeuropa/EDJNet |title=The ICT sector is booming.

According to UNESCO, there are multiple and overlapping factors which influence girls' and women's participation, achievement and progression in STEM studies and careers, all of which interact in complex ways, including: 
* '''Individual level:''' biological factors that may influence individuals’ abilities, skills, and [[Behavior|behaviour]] such as brain structure and function, [[Hormone|hormones]], [[genetics]], and cognitive traits like spatial and linguistic skills. It also considers psychological factors, including self-efficacy, interest and motivation.
* '''Family and peer level:''' parental beliefs and expectations, parental [[education]] and socioeconomic status, and other household factors, as well as peer influences.
* '''School level:''' factors within the [[learning environment]], including teachers’ profile, experience, beliefs and expectations, [[Curriculum|curricula]], learning materials and resources, [[Teaching method|teaching strategies]] and student teacher interactions, assessment practices and the overall school environment.
* '''Societal level:''' social and cultural [[norm (social)|norm]]s related to [[gender equality]], and gender stereotypes in the media.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Individual level ===
{{see also|Sex differences in psychology|Sex differences in intelligence}}
The question of whether there are differences in cognitive ability between men and women has long been a topic of debate among researchers and scholars. Some studies have found no differences in the neural mechanism of learning based on sex.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Spearman, J. and Watt, H.|first=|date=2013|title=Perception shapes experience: The influence of actual and perceived classroom environment dimensions on girls’  motivations for science|url=|journal=Learning Environment Research|volume=16|pages=217-238|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolmos, A., Mejlgaard, N., Haase, S. and Holgaard, J.E.|first=|date=2013|title=Motivational factors, gender and engineering in education|url=|journal=European Journal of Engineering Education|volume=38|pages=340-358|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDaniel, A.|first=|date=2015|title=The role of cultural contexts in explaining cross-national gender gaps in STEM Expectations|url=|journal=European Sociological Review|volume=32|pages=122-133|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Su, R., Rounds, J. and Armstrong, P.I.|first=|date=2009|title=Men and things, women and people: A meta-analysis of sex differences in interests|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=135|pages=859|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of interest has been the major reason cited for girls opting out of STEM. However, some have stated that this choice is influenced heavily by the socialization process and stereotyped ideas about gender roles, including stereotypes about gender and STEM. Gender stereotypes that communicate the idea that STEM studies and careers are male domains can negatively affect girls’ interest, engagement and achievement in STEM and discourage them from pursuing STEM careers. Girls who assimilate such stereotypes have lower levels of self-efficacy and confidence in their ability than boys. Self-efficacy affects both STEM education outcomes and aspirations for STEM careers to a considerable extent. Some studies have shown that girls appear to lose interest in STEM subjects with age.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Family and peer level ===
Parents, including their beliefs and expectations, play an important role in shaping girls’ attitudes towards, and interest in, STEM studies. Parents with traditional beliefs about gender roles and who treat girls and boys unequally can reinforce stereotypes about gender and ability in STEM. Parents can also have a strong influence on girls' STEM participation and learning achievement through the family values, environment, experiences and encouragement that they provide. Some research finds that parents’ expectations, particularly the mother’s expectations, have more influence on the [[higher education]] and career choices of girls than those of boys&lt;!-- Needs source if referring to "some research" --&gt;. Higher socio-economic status and parental educational qualifications are associated with higher scores in [[mathematics]] and science for both girls and boys. Girls’ science performance appears to be more strongly associated with mothers’ higher educational qualifications, and boys’ with their fathers’. Family members with STEM careers can also influence girls’ STEM engagement. The broader socio-cultural context of the family can also play a role. Factors such as ethnicity, the language used at home, immigrant status and family structure may also have an influence on girls’ participation and performance in STEM. Peers can also impact on girls’ motivation and feeling of belonging in STEM education. Influence of female peers is a significant predictor of girls’ interest and confidence in mathematics and science.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== School level ===
Qualified teachers with specialization in STEM can positively influence girls’ performance and engagement with STEM education and their interest in pursuing STEM careers. Female STEM teachers often have stronger benefits for girls, possibly by acting as role models and by helping to dispel stereotypes about sex-based STEM ability. Teachers’ beliefs, attitudes, behaviours and interactions with students, as well as [[Curriculum|Curricula]] and learning materials, can all play a role as well. Opportunities for real-life experiences with STEM, including hands-on practice, apprenticeships, career counselling and mentoring can expand girls’ understanding of STEM studies and professions and maintain interest. Assessment processes and tools that are gender-biased or include gender [[stereotype]]s may negatively affect girls’ performance in STEM. Girls’ learning outcomes in STEM can also be compromised by psychological factors such as mathematics or test anxiety.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

A 2018 study found that while girls perform better or equal to boys in two out of three countries, in nearly all countries more girls were qualified to college-level{{Clarify|reason=is university level STEM study meant? Native English speaker help needed.|date=March 2018}} study than had enrolled. Researchers found that female enrolment to STEM subjects was relatively lower in countries with a high degree of gender equality – a [[gender-equality paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797617741719|title=The Gender-Equality Paradox in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education|last=G. Stoet, D. C. Geary|first=|date=14 February 2018|website=SAGE Publishing|access-date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/02/180214150132.htm|title=Countries with greater gender equality have a lower percentage of female STEM graduates: Findings could help refine education efforts and policies geared toward girls and science, technology, engineering and mathematics|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Societal level ===
Cultural and [[Norm (social)|social norms]] influence girls’ perceptions about their abilities, role in society and career and life aspirations.The degree of gender equality in wider society influences girls’ participation and performance in STEM. In countries with greater gender equality, girls tend to have more positive attitudes and confidence about mathematics and the gender gap in achievement in the subject is smaller. Targeted measures to promote gender equality, such as gender mainstreaming legislation or policies such as quotas, financial incentives or other, can increase girls’ and women’s participation in STEM education and careers. Gender stereotypes portrayed in the media are internalized by children and [[Adult|adults]] and affect the way they see themselves and others. Media can perpetuate or challenge [[gender stereotypes]] about STEM abilities and careers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Gender sensitization''' precides over [[Gender Sensitivity|gender sensitivity]] which refers to the [[Behavior modification|modification of behavior]] by [[Consciousness raising|raising awareness]] of [[gender equality]] concerns.&lt;ref name="IJSR"/&gt; This can be achieved by conducting various [[sensitization]] campaigns, training centres, workshop, programs etc. Sensitization in the domain of [[Humanities]] and [[Social Sciences]], is seen as an awareness informed propensity or disposition which aims at changing behavior so that it is sensitive to certain issues. Gender sensitization may be seen as "the awareness informed disposition or propensity to behave in a manner which is sensitive to gender justice and gender equality issues."&lt;ref name="IJSR"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Understanding the Concept of Sensitisation in Humanities and Social Sciences : An Exploration in Philosophy of Mind | author=Dr. Jatinder Kumar Sharma | journal=International Journal of Scientific Research | date=March 2016 | volume= 24| issue=90 | pages=380–400}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is interlinked with [[gender empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.academia.edu/1931007/Gender_Sensitization_and_Police | title=Gender Sensitization and Police | accessdate=17 February 2014 | author=Bhowmick Soma}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender sensitization theories claim that modification of the behavior of [[teaching|teachers]] and parents (etc.) towards children which can have a causal effect on gender equality.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Gender sensitizing "is about changing behavior and instilling [[empathy]] into the views that we hold about our own and the other genders."&lt;ref name=Aksornkool&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender sensitivity: a training manual for sensitizing education managers, curriculum and material developers and media professionals to gender concerns|first=Namtip|last=Aksornkool|editor1-first=Cindy|editor1-last=Joerger|editor2-first=Elaine|editor2-last=Taylor|page=VIII}}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps people in "examining their personal attitudes and beliefs and questioning the 'realities' they thought they know.

Gender Sensitization is one basic requirement for the normal development of an individual. Without being sensitive to the needs of a particular gender, an individual may refrain from understanding the opposite gender and in some acute cases even him or herself. The need for this sensitivity has been felt and realised through times immemorial and in almost all kinds of human existence, across the globe.

'''Hajj Nematollah''' ({{lang-fa|حاجی نعمت‌الله}} 1871 &amp;ndash; February 28, 1920) was an influential [[mysticism|mystic]] and religious leader of the  [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Empire]]. He was born in [[Jeyhounabad]], [[Iran]] and is considered one of the greatest leaders and mystics in [[Kurdish history|Kurdish]] and [[Ahl-e Haqq]] history.&lt;ref&gt;Minorsky, Dr. Vladimir. "Notes sur la secte des Ahl-I Haqq", (Deuxieme partie), in ''Revue du Monde Musulman'', Volumes XLIV-XLV, 1921, 205-302.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his most famous works of poetry and history are ''Furqān al-Akhbar'' (aka "The Firkan") and ''Ḥaqq al-Ḥaqāyiq yā Shāhnāmah-ʾi Ḥaqīqat''.&lt;ref&gt;1966, Bibliothèque Iranienne, Librairie D’Amerique Et D’Orient Adrien - Maisonneuve&lt;/ref&gt; According to Encyclopædia Britannica, "The chief source of information about the Ahl-e Haqq is the ''Firqan al-Akhbar'', written in... early 20th century by (Hajj Nemat)…"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-208035/Firqan-al-Akhbar FirqÄn al-AkhbÄr -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia&lt;!-- bot-generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202172642/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-208035/Firqan-al-Akhbar|date=December 2, 2011}} at www.britannica.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Hajj Nemat's great-grandfather, Bayan Beg, accompanied Aga Abbas (one of the successors of Shah Hayas) to Jeyhounabad in the late 18th century. Bayan Beg's son, Esmail Beg, was Hajj Nemat’s grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Elahi, Nur Ali. Asar ol-haqq, Vol 1, #1849&lt;/ref&gt;

Nematollah Jeyhounabadi was born in 1871 (1288 [[Islamic calendar|Hijri calendar]]) in the small village of Kurdish Jeyhounabad. Before his birth, Persia was going through one of the worst droughts in history. His father, Bayan, named him Nematollah ("Grace of God") because on the day of his birth, Iran finally received the rain it so desperately needed.

In 1893 he married Sakina and they had their first child, Nur Ali Elahi, in 1895. At the age of thirty, during a grave illness, he claimed that he went on a journey to the beyond where he was appointed by God to announce the imminent return of the divine. Thousands of people flocked around him, and on his command ceased to take tea, tobacco and opium. He “believed the time had come to reveal the Real Truth”, and “by God’s command abandoned the world and became the messenger of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Lord of the Hour]]”. After the advent was postponed twice, he went silent and waited for the Great Essence to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Stead, F.D. The Ali Ilahi Sect in Persia, in: The Moslem World, April 1932, Vol XXII, No. 2, page 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==His family==

Hajj Nemat was married to Sakina Khanoom, with whom he had 7 children. They had 3 sons, and four daughters. The names of his sons were [[Nur Ali Elahi]], Yar Ali, Bahram, and his daughters were [[Malak Jân Nemati]], Javaher, and Mariam. In the last few days of his life Hajj Nemat had predicted his own death. Within 48 hours of his death his first grandchild, Hajj Amin Elahi, was born.

==''Forqan ol-Akhbar''==

The original manuscript of ''Forqan ol-Akhbar'' was completed in 1910 by  Hajj Nemat and is written in four parts.&lt;ref&gt;Minorsky, Dr. Vladimir. "Etudes sur les Ahl-I Haqq, I. Toumari=Ahl-I Haqq", ''Revue de L’Histoire des Religions'', volume XCVII, No. 1, January 1928, pp. 90-105.&lt;/ref&gt; His son [[Nur Ali Elahi]] wrote an introduction to ''Forqan ol-Akhbar'' and the biography of his father under the title of ''Kashf Al-Haqa’iq'' (which is approximately the first 14 pages of the manuscript, and features Nur Ali Elahi's calligraphy). ''Forqan ol-Akhbar'' is the only manuscript entirely handwritten by Hajj Nemat and is considered a historical masterpiece. Hajj Nemat gave the manuscript to [[Saeed Khan Kordestani|Dr. Saeed Khan Kordestani]] in order for him to transport it to France to have it translated by [[Vladimir Minorsky|Dr. Vladimir Minorsky]]. Unfortunately Dr. Minorsky died in 1966 before the manuscript was fully translated and published. After Minorsky’s death the manuscript became misplaced and remains unpublished as of this date.

===Part one===
The first part of ''Forqan ol-Akhbar'' deals with the fundamental principles of the ''haqiqat'' established in pre-eternity by the Divinity who in the stage of ''ya-yi ghaybat'' became externalized in the garment of Khawandagar. The law remained concealed till the coming of [[Sultan Sahak]]. Then the ''daftardars'' recorded these doctrines, but each in his own way and according to the sources which were accessible to him. As a result, the Ahl-e Haqq community has no single sacred book, and its divisions are distinguished by different views. The Ahl-e Haqq required a ''kutb-I kull'' which would be unique. So after 1324/1906 Ne’matollah, by God’s command, abandoned the world and became the "messenger of the Lord of the hour", of Pir Benyamin (explained as bin + ya + amin "faithful son of Ya"). Then comes the explanation of [[reincarnation]] (''gardish-e dun be-dun'', "going from one garment to another"). The creatures of the world are divided into two distinct categories according to their original element (''zarda-gil'' or ''khak-i siyah''). To the first belong the saved and luminous beings, whose receptive ''[[sardar]]s'' are Benyamin and Sayyid Muhammad (in his [[Avatar]] of Buzurg-sawar). To the other category belong beings of fire and darkness whose respective sardars are [[Iblis]] and [[Khannas]], with whom are associated the first three [[caliph]]s, [[Mu’awiya]], [[Aisha]], etc. The intermixture of the two categories of beings produces combinations which may be externally recognized.

===Part two===
The second part of the treatise is mainly concerned with the correspondence of the avatars through the ages. Thus manifestations of Benyamin are [[Noah]], [[Jesus]] and provisionally (''mihman'') Rustam of the Persian epic; those of Razbar: [[Sheba|Bilkis]], the Queen of Saba; [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], the mother of Jesus, etc.; those of Sayyid Muhammad: [[Zoroaster]], [[Muhammad]], etc. Next we are given the history of [[Sultan Sahak]] (Ishak) and of his successors.

===Part three===
The third part relates the personal experiences of Hajj Ne’matollah and the commandments which he received from God during his journey to the beyond (''safar-I ukba''), notably his mission to unite the 12 Ahl-e Haqq [[khanadans]], to give absolution from sins (''az khiyanat pak namudan'') and to intercede (''shifa’at'') with the Lord of Time.

===Part four===
The fourth part is a full description of rites and customs (''amr wa-nahy''), with the [[Gurani]] text of the formulae recited on each occasion.

== Ḥaqq al-Ḥaqāyiq yā Shāhnāmah-ʾi Ḥaqīqat==
The style of Ḥaqq al-Ḥaqāyiq yā Shāhnāmah-ʾi Ḥaqīqat is poetic. There is an entire chapter about [[Ali]], "The beginning was Ali and the end is Ali. Both worlds are luminous from the light of Ali. Ali is the manifestation of the pure essence of God, He is the King and Lord of both worlds. A sparkle of His essence, like the sun appeared at my time. I became so illuminated by him, that I knew of no God, other than Him."&lt;ref&gt;Hajj Nematollah,  Ḥaqq al-Ḥaqāyiq yā Shāhnāmah-ʾi Ḥaqīqat, page 394 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other works==
Hajj Nemat wrote about 20 books and essays. Among them is [[Edalat Nameh]] (The book of Justice) which is concerning government. [[Forqan ol-Akhbar]], [[Shah-Nama]], and [[Kuch-e Kurdi]] (in Kurdish verse) are all about the same subject. He also has a "Masnavi" in Persian and there is a book of his predictions. In this book, the duration of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] and their destiny in [[World War II]] can be found and there are also predictions about World War III and other subjects.

'''High culture''' encompasses the [[culture|cultural products]] of aesthetic value, which a society collectively esteem as exemplary [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Raymond. ''Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society'' (1983) Rev. Ed. p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also include intellectual works considered to be of supreme philosophical, historical, or literary value, as well as the education which cultivates such aesthetic and intellectual pursuits. In popular usage, the term ''high culture'' identifies the culture of an [[upper class]] (an [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]]) or of a [[status class]] (the [[intelligentsia]]); and also identifies a society’s common repository of broad-range knowledge and tradition (e.g. folk culture) that transcends the social-class system of the society. Sociologically, the term ''high culture'' is contrasted with the term ''[[low culture]]'', the forms of [[popular culture]] characteristic of the less-educated social classes, such as the [[barbarians]], the [[Philistinism|Philistines]], and ''[[hoi polloi]]'' (the masses).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7uMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |year=1989 |title=Edging Women Out: Victorian Novelists, Publishers and Social Change |isbn=978-0-415-03767-9 |author=Gaye Tuchman, Nina E.

==Concept==
{{more footnotes|section|date=December 2016}}
;Definition
In European history, '''high culture''' was understood as a cultural concept common to the humanities, until the mid-19th century, when [[Matthew Arnold]] introduced the term ''high culture'' in the book ''[[Culture and Anarchy]]'' (1869). The Preface defines [[culture]] as "the disinterested endeavour after man’s perfection" pursued, obtained, and achieved by effort to "know the best that has been said and thought in the world." Such a literary definition of high culture also comprehends [[philosophy]]. Moreover, the philosophy of aesthetics proposed in high culture is a force for moral and political good. Critically, the term "high culture" is contrasted with the terms "[[popular culture]]" and "[[mass culture]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Volume 1. p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Notes Towards the Definition of Culture'' (1948), [[T. S. Eliot]] said that high culture and popular culture are necessary and complementary parts of the culture of a society. In ''[[The Uses of Literacy]]'' (1957), [[Richard Hoggart]] presents the sociologic experience of the working-class man and woman in acquiring the cultural literacy, at university, which facilitates social upward mobility. In the U.S., [[Harold Bloom]] and [[F. R. Leavis]] pursued the definition of high culture, by way of the [[Western canon]] of literature.
[[File:TS Eliot.jpg|thumb|T. S. Eliot]]

Media theorist [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]] writes that, unlike popular culture, "the classics—and soon to be classics—are" in their own right descriptions and explanations of the cultural systems that produced them." He says that "a crucial way in which mass culture differs from high art" is that individual works of mass culture are less interesting than the broader cultural trends which produced them.&lt;ref name="Johnson2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Steven Johnson|title=Everything Bad is Good for You: How Popular Culture is Making Us Smarter|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2CVF7E3hpn4C&amp;q=classics|date=6 April 2006|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-0-14-193312-2|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''History of high culture in the West'''

The high culture of the [[Western culture|West]] originated in the classical-world traditions of intellectual and [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] life in [[Ancient Greece]] (from c. 8th century BC – AD 147) and [[Ancient Rome]] (753 BC – AD 476). In the classical [[Greco-Roman]] tradition, the ideal mode of language was published and preserved in works of elevated style (correct grammar, syntax, and diction). Certain forms of language used by authors in valorized epochs were held up in antiquity and the Renaissance as eternal valid models and normative standards of excellence; e.g. the Attic dialect of ancient Greek spoken and written by the playwrights and philosophers of Periclean Athens (fifth century BC); and the form of classical Latin used in the "Golden Age" of Roman culture (c. 70 B.C. - AD 18) represented by such figures as Cicero and Virgil.This form of education was known to the Greeks as παιδεία, which was translated by the Romans into Latin as ''humanitas'' &lt;ref&gt;Aulus Gellius. Attic Nights 13:17 http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/e/roman/texts/gellius/13*.html&lt;/ref&gt;'since it reflected a form of education aiming at the refinement of human nature, rather than the acquisition of technical or vocational skills. Indeed, the Greco-Roman world tended to see such manual, commercial, and technical labor as subordinate to purely intellectual activities.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. ''De Officiis''. 150 – http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2007.01.0048%3Abook%3D1%3Asection%3D150&lt;/ref&gt; From the idea of the "free" man with sufficient leisure to pursue such intellectual and aesthetic refinement, arose the classical distinction between the "liberal" arts which are intellectual and done for their own sake, as against the "servile"or "mechanical" arts which were associated with manual labor and done to earn a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/art4.htm|title=Jacques Maritain Center: Art and Scholasticism 4|website=maritain.nd.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This implied an association between high culture and the upper classes whose inherited wealth provided such time for intellectual cultivation. The leisured gentleman not weighed down by the necessity of earning a living, was free to devote himself to activities proper to such a "free man"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_88|title=Moral letters to Lucilius|last=Seneca|publisher=|via=Wikisource}}&lt;/ref&gt; – those deemed to involve true excellence and nobility as opposed to mere utility.
 
During the Renaissance, the classical intellectual values of the fully rediscovered Græco–Roman culture were the cultural capital of the upper classes(and the aspiring), and aimed at the complete development of human intellectual, aesthetic, and moral faculties. This ideal associated with humanism (a later term derived from the humanities or ''studia humanitatis''), was communicated in Renaissance Italy through institutions such as the Renaissance court schools. Renaissance humanism soon spread through Europe becoming much of the basis of upper class education for centuries. For the socially ambitious man and woman who means to rise in society, ''[[The Book of the Courtier]]'' (1528), by [[Baldasare Castiglione]], instructs the reader to acquire and possess knowledge of the Græco–Roman Classics, being education integral to the social-persona of the [[Aristocracy|aristocrat]]. A key contribution of the Renaissance was the elevation of painting and sculpture to a status equal to the liberal arts (hence the visual arts lost for elites any lingering negative association with manual artisanship.) The early Renaissance treatises of [[Leon Battista Alberti]] were instrumental in this regard.

The evolution of the concept of high culture initially was defined in educational terms largely as critical study and knowledge of the Græco–Roman arts and [[humanities]] which furnished much of the foundation for [[European culture|European cultures]] and societies. However, aristocratic patronage through most of the modern era was also pivotal to the support and creation of new works of high culture across the range of arts, music, and literature. The subsequent prodigious development of the modern European languages and cultures meant that the modern definition of the term "high culture" embraces not only Greek and Latin texts, but a much broader canon of select literary, philosophical, historical, and scientific books in both ancient and modern languages. Of comparable importance are those works of art and music considered to be of the highest excellence and broadest influence (e.g. the Parthenon, the painting and sculpture of Michelangelo, the music of Mozart, etc). Together these texts and art works constitute the exemplary artifacts representing the high culture of the Western world. 
 
;Cultural traditions
In the Western and some East Asian traditions, art that demonstrates the imagination of the artist is accorded the status of high art. In the West this tradition began in Ancient Greece, was reinforced in the [[Renaissance]], and by [[Romanticism]], which eliminated the [[hierarchy of genres]] within the [[fine arts]], which was established in the Renaissance. In China there was a distinction between the [[literati painting]] by the [[scholar-official]]s and the work produced by common artists, working in largely different styles, or the decorative arts such as [[Chinese porcelain]] which were produced by unknown craftsmen working in large factories. In both China and the West the distinction was especially clear in [[landscape painting]], where for centuries imaginary views, produced from the imagination of the artist, were considered superior works.

;Cultural capital
In socially-stratified Europe and the Americas, a first-hand immersion to the high culture of the West, the [[Grand Tour|Grand Tour of Europe]], was a rite of passage that complemented and completed the book education of a [[gentleman]], from the nobility, the aristocracy, and the bourgeoisie, with a worldly perspective of society and civilisation. The post-university tour of the cultural centres of Europe was a social-class benefit of the [[cultural capital]] transmitted through the high-status institutions (schools, academies, universities) meant to produce the ideal gentleman of that society. 

The European concept of high culture included cultivation of refined etiquette and manners; the education of taste in the fine arts such as sculpture and painting; an appreciation of classical music and opera in its diverse history and myriad forms; knowledge of the humane letters (''literae humaniores'') represented by the best Greek and Latin authors, and more broadly of the liberal arts traditions (e.g. philosophy, history, drama, rhetoric, and poetry) of Western civilisation, as well as a general acquaintance with important concepts in theology, science, and political thought.

==High art==
[[File:The MET.jpg|thumb|The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], on [[Fifth Avenue]]]]
Much of high culture consists of the appreciation of what is sometimes called "high art". This term is rather broader than Arnold's definition and besides [[literature]] includes music, [[visual arts]] (especially [[painting]]), and traditional forms of the [[performing arts]] (including some [[film|cinema]]). The [[decorative art]]s would not generally be considered high art.&lt;ref&gt;Dormer, Peter (ed.), ''The Culture of Craft'', 1997, Manchester University Press, {{ISBN|0719046181}}, 9780719046186, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wSZASV70krMC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66 google books]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural products most often regarded as forming part of high culture are most likely to have been produced during periods of high [[civilization]], for which a large, [[sophistication|sophisticated]], and wealthy urban-based society provides a coherent and conscious aesthetic framework, and a large-scale milieu of training, and, for the [[visual arts]], sourcing materials and financing work. Such an environment enables artists, as near as possible, to realize their creative potential with as few as possible practical and technical constraints. Although the Western concept of high culture naturally concentrates on the Greco-Roman tradition, and its resumption from the [[Renaissance]] onwards, such conditions existed in other places at other times.

==Art music==
{{main|Art music}}
[[Art music]] (or serious music&lt;ref&gt;a b "Music" in Encyclopedia Americana, reprint 1993, p. 647&lt;/ref&gt; or erudite music) is an [[umbrella term]] used to refer to musical traditions implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition.&lt;ref name="DenisArnold"&gt;
Denis Arnold, "Art Music, Art Song", in The New Oxford Companion to Music, Volume 1: A-J, (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1983): 111. {{ISBN|0-19-311316-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of art music is a frequent and well-defined musicological distinction – musicologist Philip Tagg, for example, refers to art music as one of an "axiomatic triangle consisting of 'folk', 'art' and 'popular' musics". He explains that each of these three is distinguishable from the others according to certain criteria, with high cultural music often performed to an audience whilst folk music would traditionally be more participatory.&lt;ref&gt;
Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", Popular Music 2 (1982): 41.
&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, "art music" frequently occurs as a contrasting term to "popular music" and to "traditional" or "folk music".&lt;ref name="DenisArnold" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Music" in ''Encyclopedia Americana'', reprint 1993, p. 647
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Tagg, "Analysing Popular Music: Theory, Method and Practice", ''Popular Music 2'' (1982): 37–67, here 41–42.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Art film==
{{main|Art film}}
[[Art film]] is the result of [[filmmaking]] which is typically a serious, [[independent film]] aimed at a [[niche market]] rather than a [[mass market]] [[audience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Art film definition – Dictionary – MSN Encarta |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |work= |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5kwKfOywe?url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861685559/art_film.html |archivedate=2009-10-31 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics and [[film studies]] scholars typically define an "art film" using a "...canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films",&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Wilinsky. {{Google books|id=0CDEQ6AEwAA|title=Sure Seaters: The Emergence of Art House Cinema}}. University of Minnesota, 2001 (Commerce and Mass Culture Series). See also review in {{Google books|id=gPMKAQAAMAAJ|page=171|Volume 32|text=canon of films and those formal qualities that mark them as different from mainstream Hollywood films}}, ''[[Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television]]'', 2004. Retrieved 2012-01-09.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes, among other elements: a [[social realism]] style; an emphasis on the authorial expressivity of the director or writer; and a focus on the thoughts and dreams of characters, rather than presenting a clear, goal-driven story. According to the film scholar [[David Bordwell]], "art cinema itself is a [[film genre]], with its own distinct conventions."&lt;ref&gt;Keith, Barry. ''Film Genres: From Iconography to Ideology''. Wallflower Press: 2007. (page 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion of high culture==
[[File:The Ballet Rambert Visiting An Aircraft Factory in Britain TR969.jpg|thumb|right|Dancers from the [[Ballet Rambert]], under the auspices of CEMA, a government programme, perform ''[[Peter and The Wolf]]'' at an aircraft factory in the English Midlands during World War II.]]
The term has always been susceptible to attack for [[elitism]], and, in response, many proponents of the concept devoted great efforts to promoting high culture among a wider public than the highly educated [[bourgeoisie]] whose natural territory it was supposed to be. There was a drive, beginning in the 19th century, to open [[museum]]s and [[concert hall]]s to give the general public access to high culture. Figures such as [[John Ruskin]] and [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|Lord Reith]] of the BBC in Britain, [[Leon Trotsky]] and others in Communist [[Russia]], and many others in America and throughout the western world have worked to widen the appeal of elements of high culture such as [[classical music]], art by [[old master]]s and the [[classic literature|literary classics]].

With the widening of access to university education, the effort spread there, and all aspects of high culture became the objects of academic study, which with the exception of the [[Classical studies|classics]] had not often been the case until the late 19th century. University [[liberal arts]] courses still play an important role in the promotion of the concept of high culture, though often now avoiding the term itself.

Especially in Europe, governments have been prepared to subsidize high culture through the funding of [[museum]]s, [[opera]] and [[ballet]] companies, [[orchestra]]s, cinema, public [[broadcasting]] stations such as [[BBC Radio 3]], [[Arte|ARTE]], and in other ways. Organizations such as the [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], and in most European countries, whole ministries administer these programs. This includes the subsidy of new works by composers, writers and artists. There are also many private philanthropic sources of funding, which are especially important in the US, where the federally funded [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] also funds broadcasting. These may be seen as part of the broader concept of [[official culture]], although often a mass audience is not the intended market.

==Theories of high culture==
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|[[Ernest Renan]] ([[Antoine Samuel Adam-Salomon]], 1870s)]]

The relations between high culture and mass culture are concerns of [[cultural studies]],  [[media studies]], and [[critical theory]], [[sociology]], [[Postmodernism]] and [[Marxist philosophy]]. In the essay "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1936), [[Walter Benjamin]] explored the relations of value of the arts (high and mass) when subjected to industrial reproduction. The critical theoreticians [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]] interpreted the high-art and mass-art cultural relations as an instrument of social control, with which the [[ruling class]] maintain their [[cultural hegemony]] upon society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = McGregor| first = Craig| authorlink =| title = Class in Australia | edition=1| year=1997| publisher  = Penguin Books Australia Ltd| location=Ringwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-14-008227-2| page = 301| quote= Élite culture is often an instrument of social control. . . .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Orientalist [[Ernest Renan]] and for the rationalist philosopher [[Ernest Gellner]], high culture was conceptually integral to the politics and ideology of [[nationalism]], as a requisite part of a healthy national identity. Gellner expanded the conceptual scope of the phrase in ''Nations and Nationalism'' (1983) stating that high art is "a literate, codified culture, which permits context-free communication" among cultures.

In ''[[La Distinction|Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste]]'' (1979), the sociologist [[Pierre Bourdieu]] proposed that æsthetic taste (cultural judgement), derived from social class, in establishing definitions of high art by the practice of human activities such as [[etiquette|social etiquette]], [[gastronomy]], [[oenology]], [[military service]]. That in such activities of aesthetic judgement, the ruling-class person uses social codes unknown to middle- and the lower-class persons in the pursuit and practice activities of taste.

'''International Yacht Training Worldwide''' (IYT Worldwide) is an independent sailing and boating training organization which provides education and training standards for professional and recreational boaters and yachtsmen and women. It was originally based entirely in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, USA; it is now a  British Columbia, Canada Corporation based in Kelowna.
Its qualifications are similar to those of the [[Royal Yachting Association]] (RYA) at the recreational level, but IYT Worldwide also offers additional courses at the professional level. It is regulated by a number of [[Maritime Administrations]] and has an [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] [[Quality Management System]] to independently monitor and control all of its training standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edumaritime.net/florida/iyt-fort-lauderdale-pyt-usa-florida IYT Fort Lauderdale]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

IYT Worldwide was founded by Mark Fry in 1998 as a credible alternative to the RYA with the purpose of providing training for crews of [[Luxury yacht|superyachts]] by offering professional yachtsmen and women the opportunity to train for their career outside the UK, a first for the professional yachting fraternity. 
IYT Worldwide was approved, and its courses recognized by the UK [[Maritime and Coastguard Agency]] (MCA),in October 1999 and is now recognized as a world leader by multiple administrations due to its numerous (20 plus) international recognitions covering a large number of its courses. IYT has trained over 110,000 candidates in the last 12 years.
Due to its dedication to high standards, quality training and the implementation of its ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management System, the company has enjoyed an international expansion which now includes almost 300 partner schools in 56 countries. No other yacht training organisation is as internationally recognised or accepted as IYT.

==Global spread==
Initially recognized for its professional courses, IYT has successfully developed professional, recreational and other boating [[watersports]] courses delivered through licensed training schools. There are currently 271 partner schools around the world in 56 different countries (October 2017). These include Australia, Austria, Bahamas, Barbados, Belarus, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Brunei, Bulgaria, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Croatia,Cyprus, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, France, French West Indies, Gibraltar, Greece, Honduras, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel,Italy, Kuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Malaysia, Maldives, Malta, Moldova, Montenegro, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Postugal, Romania, Russia, Singapore, St Maarten, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, St Lucia, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine,United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom and the United States.

==Membership==

There are basically 2 membership levels, those partner schools offering recreational courses and those offering professional yachting courses such as Master of Yachts (MOY) and [[STCW]], [[Basic Safety Training]].

Two levels of qualification may be obtained from IYT Worldwide training providers:

Level 1	
•	Recreational boating courses from ‘Introduction to Boating’ through ‘Recreational Yachtmaster Coastal, Yachmaster Offshore and Yachtmaster Ocean’ ( Modules 1 to 21 in the IYT Passport booklet)

==International Certificate of Competence - ICC==

[[International Certificate of Competence]] Also referred to as International Certificate of Competency, may be required to operate a vessel in EU waters, both coastal and internal. It is a certificate which is similar to an [[International Drivers License]].

An International Certificate of Competence (ICC) is a certificate which may be issued to anyone who has successfully completed certain national boating licenses or met the ICC Standards of Knowledge and practical competencies. Almost all member states within the European Union have accepted the IYT World ICC.

Although only guaranteed to be accepted in countries that have adopted the relevant UN Resolution 40, the ICC is a useful document to carry and will generally be accepted where proof of competence is required.

In general terms an ICC is required for the inland waterways of Europe and for inland and coastal waters of Mediterranean countries. For the coastal waters of Northern Europe the ICC is generally not required, however to all of these generalisations there are exceptions.

If in doubt, be sure to check with the country administration you are visiting and the charter company that you are chartering with .

'''Lichenology''' is the branch of [[mycology]] that studies the [[lichen]]s, [[symbiotic]] [[organism]]s made up of an intimate symbiotic association of a microscopic [[alga]] (or a [[cyanobacterium]]) with a [[Hypha|filament]]ous [[fungus]].

Study of lichens draws knowledge from several disciplines: [[mycology]], [[phycology]], [[microbiology]] and [[botany]]. Scholars of lichenology are known as [[lichenologists]].

The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of lichens was first intensively investigated by the [[Sweden|Swedish]] botanist [[Erik Acharius]] (1757–1819), who is therefore sometimes named the "father of lichenology". Acharius was a student of [[Carl Linnaeus]]. Some of his more important works on the subject, which marked the beginning of lichenology as a discipline, are:

* ''Lichenographiae Suecia prodromus'' (1798)
* ''Methodus lichenum'' (1803)
* ''Lichenographia universalis'' (1810)
* ''Synopsis methodica lichenum'' (1814)

Later lichenologists include the American scientists [[Vernon Ahmadjian]] and [[Edward Tuckerman]] and the [[Russia]]n [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Konstantin Merezhkovsky]], as well as amateurs such as [[Louisa Collings]].

==History==

===The beginnings===

Lichens as a group have received less attention in classical treatises on botany than other groups although the relationship between humans and some species has been documented from early times. Several species have appeared in the works of [[Dioscorides]], [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Theophrastus]] although the studies are not very deep. During the first centuries of the modern age they were usually put forward as examples of [[spontaneous generation]] and their reproductive mechanisms were totally ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens'' p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries naturalists had included lichens in diverse groups until in the early 18th century a French researcher [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] in his ''Institutiones Rei Herbariae'' grouped them into their own genus. He adopted the Latin term lichen, which had already been used by Pliny who had imported it from Theophrastus but up until then this term had not been widely employed.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens'' p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The original meaning of the Greek word λειχήν (leichen) was moss that in its turn derives from the Greek verb λείχω (liekho) to suck because of the great ability of these organisms to absorb water. In its original use the term signified [[mosses]], [[liverworts]] as well as [[lichens]]. Some forty years later [[Dillenius]] in his ''Historia Muscorum'' made the first division of the group created by Tournefort separating the sub-families [[Usnea]], [[Coralloides]] and [[Lichens]] in response to the morphological characteristics of the lichen [[thallus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Joseph Pitton de Tournefort |title=Institutiones rei herbariae |language=Latin |trans-title=Institutions of botany |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2BkOAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Tournefort%22+%22Institutiones+rei+Herbariae%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tournefort%22%20%22Institutiones%20rei%20Herbariae%22&amp;f=false|year=1700 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the revolution in [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] brought in by [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] and his new system of classification lichens are retained in the [[Plant]] Kingdom forming a single group [[Lichen]] with eight divisions within the group according to the morphology of the [[thallus]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years research is shedding new light into the nature of these organisms still classified as plants. A controversial issue surrounding lichens since the early 19th century is their reproduction. In these years a group of researchers faithful to the tenets of Linnaeus considered that lichens reproduced sexually and had sexual reproductive organs, as in other plants, independent of whether asexual reproduction also occurred. Other researchers only considered asexual reproduction by means of [[Propagules]].&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William. ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

Against this background appeared the Swedish botanist [[Erik Acharius]] disciple of Linnaeus, who is today considered the father of lichenology, starting the taxonomy of lichens with his pioneering study of Swedish lichens in Lichenographiae Suecicae Prodromus of 1798 or in his Synopsis Methodica Lichenum, Sistens omnes hujus Ordinis Naturalis of 1814.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Acharius |first=Erik |date=1814 |title=Synopsis Methodica Lichenum: Systens omnes hujus ordinis naturalis detectas |language=Latin |trans-title=Synopsis of lichen Methods, systems of this natural order detected |publisher=Svanborg}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies and classifications are the cornerstone of subsequent investigations. In these early years of structuring the new discipline various works of outstanding scientific importance appeared such as Lichenographia Europaea Reformata published in 1831 by [[Elias Fries]] or Enumeratio Critico Lichenum Europaeorum 1850 by [[Ludwig Schaerer]]&lt;ref&gt;http://plants.jstor.org/person/bm000391348?history=true&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erik Acharius.jpg|thumb|Erik Acharius (1757–1819), Swedish botanist, the father of lichenology]] But these works suffer from being superficial and mere lists of species without further physiological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schneider | first1 = Albert | year = 1895 | title = The Biological Status of Lichens | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club | volume = 22 | issue = | page = 5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It took until the middle of the 19th century for research to catch up using biochemical and physiological methods. In Germany [[Ernst Itzigsohn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?id=3942 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Johann Bayrhoffer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?mode=details&amp;botanistid=1617 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France [[Edmond Tulasne]] and [[Camille Montagne]], in Russia [[Fedor Buhse]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?id=63245 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; in England [[William Allport Leighton]] and in the United States [[Edward Tuckerman]] began to publish works of great scientific importance.

Scientific publications settled many unknown facts about lichens. In the French publication [[Annales des Sciences Naturelles]] in an article of 1852 "Memorie pour servir a l'Histoire des Lichens Organographique et Physiologique" by [[Edmond Tulasne]], the reproductive organs or apothecia of lichens was identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Williams | first1 = Thomas A. | year = 1856 | title = The Status of the Algo-Lichen Hypothesis | url = | journal = The American Naturalist | volume = 23 | issue = 265 | pages = 1–8 | doi =10.1086/274846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lauder Lindsay, William (1856). ''A Popular History of British Lichens''. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

These new discoveries were becoming increasingly contradictory for scientists. The [[apothecium]] reproductive organ being unique to [[fungi]] but absent in other [[photosynthetic]] organisms. With improvements in [[microscopy]], [[algae]] were identified in the lichen structure, which heightened the contradictions. At first the presence of algae was taken as being due to contamination due to collection of samples in damp conditions and they were not considered as being in a [[symbiotic]] relation with the fungal part of the thallus. That the algae continued to multiply showed that they were not mere contaminants.

It was [[Anton de Bary]] a German [[mycologist]] who specialised in [[phytopathology]] who first suggested in 1865 that lichens were merely the result of parasitism of various fungi of the [[ascomycetes]] group by [[nostoc]] type algae and others. Successive studies such as those carried out by [[Andrei Famintsyn]] and [[Baranetzky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kiki.huh.harvard.edu/databases/botanist_search.php?mode=details&amp;id=70084 | title=Harvard University Herbaria &amp; Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1867 showed no dependence of the algal component upon the lichen thallus and that the algal component could live independently of the thallus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = Bruce | year = 1913 | title = The Nature and Classification of Lichens: II. The Lichen and its Algal Host | doi = 10.2307/3753090 | journal = Mycologia | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 97–166 | jstor = 3753090 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in 1869 that [[Simon Schwendener]] demonstrated that all lichens were the result of fungal attack on the cells of algal cells and that all these algae also exist free in nature. This researcher was the first to recognise the dual nature of lichens as a result of the capture of the algal component by the fungal component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Honegger | first1 = Rosmarie | year = 2000 | title = Simon Schwendener (1829–1919) and The Dual Hypothesis of Lichens | doi = 10.1639/0007-2745(2000)103[0307:ssatdh]2.0.co;2 | journal = The Bryologist | volume = 103 | issue = 2 | pages = 307–313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1873 [[Jean-Baptiste Edouard Bornet]] concluded form studying many different lichen species that the relationship between fungi and algae was purely [[symbiotic]]. It was also established that algae could associate with many different fungi to form different lichen [[phenotypes]]. [[File:Édouard Bornet.jpg|thumb|French botanist (Jean-Baptiste) Édouard Bornet (1828–1911)]]

===20th century===

In 1909 the Russian lichenologist [[Konstantin Mereschkowski]] presented a research paper "The Theory of two Plasms as the basis of [[Symbiogenesis]], A new study on the Origin of Organisms", which aims to explain a new theory of Symbiogenesis by lichens and other organisms as evidenced by his earlier work "Nature and Origin of [[Chromatophores]] in the Plant Kingdom". These new ideas can be studied today under the title of the Theory of [[Endosymbiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cavalier-Smith | first1 = T | year = 2003 | title = Microbial Muddles | doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2003)053[1008:mm]2.0.co;2 | journal = BioScience | volume = 53 | issue = 10 | pages = 1008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the above studies the dual nature of lichens remained no more than a theory until in 1939 the Swiss researcher Eugen A Thomas&lt;ref&gt;[[Species:Eugen A. Thomas]]&lt;/ref&gt; was able to reproduce in the laboratory the phenotype of the lichen ''[[Cladonia pyxidata]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.voyageurcountry.com/htmls/floweringplants/plants/pixiecups.html | title=Pixie Cups (Cladonia pyxidata)}}&lt;/ref&gt; by combining its two identified components.

During the 20th century botany and mycology were still attempting to solve the two main problems surrounding lichens. On the one hand the definition of lichens and the relationship between the two symbionts and the taxonomic position of these organisms within the plant and fungal kingdoms. There appeared numerous renowned researchers within the field of lichenology [[Henry Nicollon des Abbayes]], [[William Alfred Weber]], [[Antonina Georgievna Borissova]], [[Irwin M. Brodo]], [[George Albert Llano]].

Lichenology has found applications beyond [[biology]] itself in the field of [[geology]] in a technique known as [[lichenometry]] where the age of an exposed surface can be found by studying the age of lichens growing on them. Age dating in this way can be absolute or relative because the growth of these organisms can be arrested under various conditions. The technique provides an average age of the older individual lichens providing a minimum age of the medium being studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Procesos biofísicos actuales en medios fríos: estudios recientes |language=Spanish |trans-title=Current biophysical processes in cold environments: recent studies |editor=Antonio Gómez Ortiz |date=1998 |publisher=Edicions Universitat Barcelona |url=https://books.google.com/?id=r_LQ70GnOnoC&amp;pg=RA1-PA327&amp;dq=lichenometry#v=onepage&amp;q=lichenometry&amp;f=false|isbn=9788447519231 }} Miguel Mateo Garcia, The Growth Curve of Rhizocarpon geographicum in the Valley of Madriu Andorra, Biophysical Processes in Cold Media {{ISBN|84-475-1923-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lichenometry relies upon the fact that the maximum diameter of the largest thallus of an [[epilithic]] lichen growing on a substrate is directly proportional to the time from first exposure of the area to the environment as seen in studies by [[Roland Beschel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/assets/publications/subsections/pdfs/OnsitePublicationSubsection/91/4.2.7_lichenometry.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203072554/http://www.geomorphology.org.uk/assets/publications/subsections/pdfs/OnsitePublicationSubsection/91/4.2.7_lichenometry.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1950 and is especially useful in areas exposed for less than 1000 years. Growth is greatest in the first 20 to 100 years with 15–50&amp;nbsp;mm growth per year and less in the following years with average growth of 2–4&amp;nbsp;mm per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=xASdKCoT6McC&amp;pg=PA562&amp;dq=lichenometry#v=onepage&amp;q=lichenometry&amp;f=false |last=Schaetzl Randall |first=J; |author2=Sharon Anderson |year=2005 |title=Soils Genesis &amp; Geomorphology |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=562 |isbn=978-0521812016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty of giving a definition applicable to every known lichen has been debated since lichenologists first recognised the dual nature of lichens. In 1982 the [[International Association for Lichenology]] convened a meeting to adopt a single definition of lichen drawing on the proposals of a committee. The chairman of this committee was the renowned researcher [[Vernon Ahmadjian]]. The definition finally adopted was that lichen could be considered as the association between a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a thallus of specific structure.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 1989"&gt;David L. Hawksworth (1989) "Interactions Fungus and Alga in Lichen Symbiosis liquenoides" ''Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid'' (46).&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a simple [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]] definition soon brought criticism from various lichenologists and there soon emerged reviews and suggestions for amendments. For example, [[David L. Hawksworth]] considered the definition imperfect because it is impossible to determine which one thallus is of a specific structure since thalli changed depending upon the substrate and conditions in which they developed. This researcher represents one of the main trends among lichenologists who consider it impossible to give a single definition to lichens since they are a unique type of organism.&lt;ref name="Hawksworth 1989"/&gt;

Today studies in lichenology are not restricted to the description and taxonomy of lichens but have application in various scientific fields. Especially important are studies on [[environmental quality]] that are made through the interaction of lichens with their environment. Lichen is extremely sensitive to various air pollutants, especially to [[sulphur dioxide]], which causes [[acid rain]] and prevents water absorption.

==Lichens in pharmacology==
Although several species of lichen have been used in [[traditional medicine]] it was not until the early 20th century that modern science became interested in them. The discovery of various substances with [[antibacterial]] action in lichen thalli was essential for scientists to become aware of the possible importance of these organisms to [[medicine]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lichens.science.oregonstate.edu/antibiotics/lichen_antibiotics.htm] Mike Crockett, Stacie Kageyama, Delfina Homen, Carrie Lewis, Jane Osborn, Logan Sander (2003). "Antibacterial Properties of four Pacific North West Lichens".&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1940s there appeared various works by the noted [[microbiologist]] [[Rufus Paul Burkholder]] who demonstrated antibacterial action of lichens of the genus ''[[Usnea]]'' against ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and ''[[Sarcina lutea]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://modmedmicrobes.wikispaces.com/Sarcina+Lutea | title=Wikispaces}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies showed that the substance that inhibited growth of bacteria was [[usnic acid]]. Something similar occurred with the substance [[Ramelina]] synthesised by the lichen ''[[Ramalina reticulata]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/106/2756/394.extract | doi=10.1126/science.106.2756.394| pmid=17750561| title=Antibiotic Compound Isolated from the Lichen Ramalina reticulata| journal=Science| volume=106| issue=2756| pages=394–395| year=1947| last1=Marshak| first1=A.| last2=Barry| first2=G. T.| last3=Craig| first3=L. C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless, these substances proved ineffective against [[Gram negative bacteria]] such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]''. With these investigations the number of antibacterial substances and possible drug targets known to be produced by lichens increased [[ergosterol]], [[usnic acid]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Bustinza, Francisco (1948) "Contribution to the Study of Antibiotics Produced by Lichens". ''Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid'' (7) ISSN pp. 511–548.&lt;/ref&gt;

Interest in the potential of substances synthesised by lichens increased with the end of [[World War II]] along with the growing interest in all [[antibiotic]] substances. In 1947 antibacterial action was identified in extracts of ''[[Cetraria islandica]]'' and the compounds identified as responsible for bacterial inhibition were shown to be [[d-protolichosteric acid]] and [[d-1-usnic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;Bustinza, Francisco (1951) "Contribution to the Study of Antibacterial Activity in ''Cetraria islandica''". ''Annals of the Botanical Garden of Madrid'' (10) ISSN pp. 144–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Further investigations have identified novel antibacterial substances, [[Alectosarmentin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Antibacterial action of substances produced by lichens is related to their ability to disrupt bacterial [[proteins]] with a subsequent loss of bacterial [[metabolic]] capacity. This is possible due to the action of lichen [[Natural phenol|phenol]]ics such as [[usnic acid]] derivatives.&lt;ref&gt;Neli Kika Honda &amp; Wagner Vilegas (1998) "The Chemistry of Lichens" (Port)[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0100-40421999000100018&amp;lng=in&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=in] Quimica Nova 22(1) ISSN 0100-4042&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1950s the lichen product [[usnic acid]] was the object of most [[antitumour]] research. These studies revealed some [[in vitro]] antitumour activity by substances identified in two common lichens ''[[Peltigera leucophlebia]]'' and ''[[Collema flaccidum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;t=%22Collema+flaccidum%22 | title=EBI Search}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Logic in computer science''' covers the overlap between the field of [[logic]] and that of [[computer science]]. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas:
* Theoretical foundations and analysis
* Use of computer technology to aid logicians
* Use of concepts from logic for computer applications

== Theoretical foundations and analysis ==
Logic plays a fundamental role in computer science.  Some of the key areas of logic that are particularly significant are [[computability theory]] (formerly called recursion theory), [[modal logic]] and [[category theory]]. The [[theory of computation]] is based on concepts defined by logicians and mathematicians such as [[Alonzo Church]] and [[Alan Turing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lewis|first=Harry R.|title=Elements of the Theory of Computation|year=1981|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey|isbn=0-13-273417-6|author2=Christos H. Papadimitriou|authorlink1=Harry R. Lewis|authorlink2=Christos Papadimitriou }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Martin|title=The Universal Turing Machine|publisher=Springer Verlag|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YafIDVd1Z68C&amp;pg=PA290#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|editor=Rolf Herken|accessdate=26 December 2013|chapter=Influences of Mathematical Logic on Computer Science|authorlink=Martin Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Church first showed the existence of algorithmically unsolvable problems using his notion of lambda-definability.  Turing gave the first compelling analysis of what can be called a mechanical procedure and [[Kurt Gödel]] asserted that he found Turing's analysis "perfect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=Juliette|title=Interpreting Godel|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=ulw3BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=Godel+convinced+by+Turing's+analysis&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Wa1PunvmLM&amp;sig=yuj5GsarLT3PoTESY46s8L9x9rY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAmoVChMIya2n8dGwxwIVUQmSCh0c8AIb#v=onepage&amp;q=Godel%20convinced%20by%20Turing's%20analysis&amp;f=false|accessdate= 17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition some other major areas of theoretical overlap between logic and computer science are:
*[[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]] proves that any logical system powerful enough to characterize arithmetic will contain statements that can neither be proved nor disproved within that system.  This has direct application to theoretical issues relating to the feasibility of proving the completeness and correctness of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hofstadter|first=Douglas R.|title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0465026562|authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
*The [[frame problem]] is a basic problem that must be overcome when using [[first-order logic]] to represent the goals and state of an artificial intelligence agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCarthy|first=J|author2=P.J. Hayes |title=Some philosophical problems from the standpoint of artificial intelligence|journal=Machine Intelligence|year=1969|volume=4|pages=463–502|authorlink1=John McCarthy (computer scientist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;!-- *[[Category theory]] is the formal analysis and transformation of [[Graph theory|directed graphs]], an area with some applications in computer science, most notably programming languages and compilers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=DeLoach|first=Scott|author2=Thomas Hartrum |title=A Theory Based Representation for Object-Oriented Domain Models|journal=IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering|date=June 2000|volume=25|issue=6|doi=10.1109/32.852740|pages=500–517}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
*The [[Curry-Howard correspondence]] is a relation between logical systems and software. This theory established a precise correspondence between proofs and programs.  In particular it showed that terms in the simply-typed lambda-calculus correspond to proofs of intuitionistic propositional logic.
*[[Category theory]] represents a view of mathematics that emphasizes the relations between structures.  It is intimately tied to many aspects of computer science: type systems for programming languages, the theory of transition systems, models of programming languages and the theory of programming language semantics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael|last=Barr|title=Category Theory for Computer|year=1990|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author2=Charles Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computers to assist logicians ==
One of the first applications to use the term [[Artificial Intelligence]] was the Logic Theorist system developed by [[Allen Newell]], J.C. Shaw, and [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] in 1956. One of the things that a logician does is to take a set of statements in logic and deduce the conclusions (additional statements) that must be true by the laws of logic. For example, If given a logical system that states "All humans are mortal" and "Socrates is human" a valid conclusion is "Socrates is mortal".  Of course this is a trivial example. In actual logical systems the statements can be numerous and complex. It was realized early on that this kind of analysis could be significantly aided by the use of computers. The Logic Theorist validated the theoretical work of [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] in their influential work on mathematical logic called [[Principia Mathematica]]. In addition, subsequent systems have been utilized by logicians to validate and discover new logical theorems and proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newell|first=Allen|title=Computers and Thought|year=1963|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=978-0262560924|pages=109–133 |author2=J.C. Shaw |author3=H.C. Simon|editor=Ed Feigenbaum|chapter=Empirical explorations with the logic theory machine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Logic applications for computers ==
There has always been a strong influence from mathematical logic on the field of [[Artificial Intelligence|Artificial Intelligence (AI)]]. From the beginning of the field it was realized that technology to automate logical inferences could have great potential to solve problems and draw conclusions from facts. Ron Brachman has described [[first-order logic]] (FOL) as the metric by which all AI knowledge representation formalisms should be evaluated. There is no more general or powerful known method for describing and analyzing information than FOL. The reason FOL itself is simply not used as a computer language is that it is actually too expressive, in the sense that FOL can easily express statements that no computer, no matter how powerful, could ever solve. For this reason every form of knowledge representation is in some sense a trade off between expressivity and computability. The more expressive the language is, the closer it is to FOL, the more likely it is to be slower and prone to an infinite loop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levesque|first=Hector|title=Reading in Knowledge Representation|year=1985|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=0-934613-01-X|page=49|author2=Ronald Brachman |editor=Ronald Brachman and Hector J. Levesque|chapter=A Fundamental Tradeoff in Knowledge Representation and Reasoning|quote=The good news in reducing KR service to theorem proving is that we now have a very clear, very specific notion of what the KR system should do; the bad new is that it is also clear that the services can not be provided... deciding whether or not a sentence in FOL is a theorem... is unsolvable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, IF THEN rules used in [[Expert system|Expert Systems]] approximate to a very limited subset of FOL. Rather than arbitrary formulas with the full range of logical operators the starting point is simply what logicians refer to as [[Modus Ponens]]. As a result, [[Rule-based system|rule based systems]] can support high-performance computation, especially if they take advantage of optimization algorithms and compilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Forgy|first=Charles|title=Rete: A Fast Algorithm for the Many Pattern/Many Object Pattern Match Problem*|journal=Artificial Intelligence|year=1982|volume=19|pages=17–37|url=http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/yusong/lecture/data/BI/Materials/1.1.Rete%20-%20A%20Fast%20Algorithm%20for%20the%20Many%20Pattern,%20Many%20Object%20Pattern%20Match%20Problem.pdf|accessdate=25 December 2013|doi=10.1016/0004-3702(82)90020-0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227044049/http://web.yonsei.ac.kr/yusong/lecture/data/BI/Materials/1.1.Rete%20-%20A%20Fast%20Algorithm%20for%20the%20Many%20Pattern,%20Many%20Object%20Pattern%20Match%20Problem.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-27|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major area of research for logical theory was software engineering. Research projects such as the [[Knowledge Based Software Assistant|Knowledge-Based Software Assistant]] and Programmer's Apprentice programs applied logical theory to validate the correctness of software specifications. They also used them to transform the specifications into efficient code on diverse platforms and to prove the equivalence between the implementation and the specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rich|first=Charles|author2=Richard C. Waters |title=The Programmer's Apprentice Project: A Research Overview|journal=IEE Expert Special Issue on the Interactions between Expert Systems and Software Engineering|date=November 1987|url=ftp://publications.ai.mit.edu/ai-publications/pdf/AIM-1004.pdf|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This formal transformation driven approach is often far more effort than traditional software development. However, in specific domains with appropriate formalisms and reusable templates the approach has proven viable for commercial products. The appropriate domains are usually those such as weapons systems, security systems, and real time financial systems where failure of the system has excessively high human or financial cost. An example of such a domain is [[Very-large-scale integration|Very Large Scale Integrated (VLSI) Design]]—the process for designing the chips used for the CPU's and other critical components of digital devices. An error in a chip is catastrophic. Unlike software, chips can't be patched or updated. As a result, there is commercial justification for using formal methods to prove that the implementation corresponds to the specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stavridou|first=Victoria|title=Formal Methods in Circuit Design|year=1993|publisher=Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge|isbn=0-521-443369|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hf_AZfW2YWsC&amp;pg=PA14&amp;lpg=PA14&amp;dq=VLSI+chip+design+formal+methods&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KzTJ7IrWmm&amp;sig=jUvF19wOzfMqUGh4YQl5XzZrEfY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W1K8Uu7YItXloASPsoCwCw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=VLSI%20chip%20design%20formal%20methods&amp;f=false|accessdate=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important application of logic to computer technology has been in the area of [[frame language]]s and automatic classifiers. [[Frame language]]s such ais [[KL-ONE]] have a rigid semantics. Definitions in KL-ONE can be directly mapped to set theory and the predicate calculus. This allows specialized theorem provers called classifiers to analyze the various declarations between sets, subsets, and relations in a given model. In this way the model can be validated and any inconsistent definitions flagged. The classifier can also infer new information, for example define new sets based on existing information and change the definition of existing sets based on new data. The level of flexibility is ideal for handling the ever changing world of the Internet. Classifier technology is built on top of languages such as the [[Web Ontology Language]] to allow a logical semantic level on to the existing Internet. This layer of is called the [[Semantic web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacGregor|first=Robert|title=Using a description classifier to enhance knowledge representation|journal=IEEE Expert|date=June 1991|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=87683&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D87683|accessdate=10 November 2013|doi=10.1109/64.87683|pages=41–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |author2=James Hendler |author3=Ora Lassila |title=The Semantic Web A new form of Web content that is meaningful to computers will unleash a revolution of new possibilities |journal=Scientific American |date=May 17, 2001 |url=http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html |authorlink=Tim Berners-Lee |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0501-34 |volume=284 |pages=34–43 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130424071228/http://www.cs.umd.edu/~golbeck/LBSC690/SemanticWeb.html |archivedate=April 24, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1617">The '''luang pho phet''' ({{lang-th|หลวงพ่อเพชร}}) is a type of image of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] found in [[Thailand]].  A luang pho phet depicts the Buddha in the ''Diamond [[Lotus Position]].''

==Notable luang pho phet images==
[[File:Luang Pho Phet (Wat Tha Thanon).jpg|thumb|Luang pho phet at Wat Tha Thanon]]
Notable luang pho phet Buddha images include the luang pho phet of [[Uttaradit]] (in Wat Tha Thanon), the luang pho phet of [[Phichit]] (in Wat Tha Luang), and the luang pho phet of [[Nakhon Thai Subdistrict|Nakhon Thai]] (in Wat Na Phra That).  The luang pho phet in Uttaradit is believed to have been constructed between 800 and 900 years ago.&lt;ref name="Chimburi.com"&gt;[http://www.chimburi.com/thai485.htm Wat Tha Thanon temple on Chimburi.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==luang pho phet in prayer==

An English translation of a common Pali chant to be said before a luang pho phet image is as follows:&lt;ref name="Wat Pradhātu"&gt;See, e.g., [http://vipassanasangha.free.fr/ChantingBook.pdf Chanting Book of Wat Pradhātu Srī Chomtong Voravihāra]&lt;/ref&gt;
:By body, by speech, and by mind, I will always revere the image named luang pho phet,
:the Buddha statue, working wonders of psychic power.  May I be blessed forevermore.

The text of the chant in Pali is as follows:
:Kāyena vācāya va cetassa vā vajiraü nāma pañimaü iddhi-pāñihāriyakaraü buddha-rūpaü ahaü vandāmi sabbaso; sadā sotthī bhavantu me.

'''Military science''' is the study of military processes, institutions, and behavior, along with the study of warfare, and the theory and application of organized coercive force.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, 2013. p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly focused on [[Military theory|theory]], method, and practice of producing [[military capability]] in a manner consistent with [[national defense policy]]. Military science serves to identify the [[military strategy|strategic]], [[politics|political]], [[economics|economic]], [[psychology|psychological]], [[sociology|social]], [[military operation|operational]], [[military technology|technological]], and [[military tactics|tactical]] elements necessary to sustain relative advantage of [[armed forces|military force]]; and to increase the likelihood and favorable outcomes of [[victory]] in peace or during a war. Military scientists include theorists, researchers, experimental scientists, applied scientists, designers, engineers, test technicians, and other [[military personnel]].

Military personnel obtain [[weapon]]s, [[Military equipment|equipment]], and [[Military training|training]] to achieve specific [[strategic goal (military)|strategic goal]]s. Military science is also used to establish enemy capability as part of [[technical intelligence]].

In military history, military science had been used during the period of [[Industrial Revolution]] as a general term to refer to all matters of military theory and technology application as a single [[Academia|academic discipline]], including that of the deployment and employment of troops in peacetime or in battle.

In [[military education]], military science is often the name of the [[Academic department|department]] in the [[Higher education|education institution]] that administers [[Officer Candidate School|officer candidate education]]. However, this education usually focuses on the officer leadership training and basic information about employment of military theories, concepts, methods and systems, and [[Officer Candidate|graduates]] are not military scientists on completion of studies, but rather [[Military rank|junior military officers]].

==History==
{{main|Military history}}
[[File:Telephony Class NGM-v31-p357.jpg|thumb|left|CLASS IN TELEPHONY: ENLISTED MEN, U. S. ARMY. The  telephone in modern warfare has robbed battle of much of its picturesqueness, romance, and glamor; as the dashing [[dispatch rider]] on his foam-flecked steed is antiquated. A message sent by telephone annihilates space and time, whereas the dispatch rider would, in most cases, be annihilated by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]]. Published 1917.]]

Even until the Second World War, military science was written in English starting with capital letters, and was thought of as an academic discipline alongside Physics, Philosophy and the Medical Science. In part this was due to the general mystique that accompanied education in a World where as late as the 1880s 75% of the European population was illiterate.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The ability by the officers to make complex calculations required for the equally complex "evolutions" of the troop movements in linear warfare that increasingly dominated the [[Renaissance]] and later history, and the introduction of the gunpowder weapons into the equation of warfare only added to the veritable arcana of building fortifications as it seemed to the average individual.

Until the early 19th century, one observer, a British veteran of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Major John Mitchell thought that it seemed nothing much had changed from the application of force on a battlefield since the days of the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;p.12, Gat&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that this was primarily so because as [[Carl von Clausewitz|Clausewitz]] suggested, "unlike in any other science or art, in war the object reacts".&lt;ref&gt;cf p.12, Gat&lt;/ref&gt;

Until this time, and even after the [[Franco-Prussian War]], military science continued to be divided between the formal thinking of officers brought up in the "shadow" of Napoleonic Wars and younger officers like [[Ardant du Picq]] who tended to view fighting performance as rooted in the individual's and [[group psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;p.29, Gat&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested detailed analysis of this. This set in motion the eventual fascination of the military organisations with application of quantitative and qualitative research to their theories of combat; the attempt to translate military thinking as philosophic concepts into concrete methods of combat.

Military implements, the supply of an army, its organization, tactics, and discipline, have constituted the elements of military science in all ages; but improvement in weapons and accoutrements appears to lead and control all the rest.&lt;ref&gt;p.194, Lodge&lt;/ref&gt;

The breakthrough of sorts made by Clausewitz in suggesting eight principles on which such methods can be based, in Europe, for the first time presented an opportunity to largely remove the element of chance and error from command decision making process.&lt;ref&gt;p.12, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt; At this time emphasis was made on the [[Topography]] (including [[Trigonometry]]), [[Military art (Military science)]],&lt;ref&gt;taught by a Professor of Military Art at the Staff School in France, p.248, Barnard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Military history]], Organisation of the Army in the field, [[Artillery]] and Science of [[Projectile]]s, [[Field fortifications]] and [[Permanent fortifications]], [[Military legislation]], [[Military administration]] and [[wikt:maneuver|Manoeuvres]].&lt;ref&gt;p.248, Barnard&lt;/ref&gt;

The military science on which the model of German combat operations was built for the First World War remained largely unaltered from the Napoleonic model, but took into the consideration the vast improvements in the [[firepower]] and the ability to conduct "great battles of annihilation" through rapid [[concentration of force]], [[strategic mobility]], and the maintenance of the [[strategic offensive]]&lt;ref&gt;p.113, Gat&lt;/ref&gt; better known as the [[Cult of the offensive]]. The key to this, and other modes of thinking about war remained analysis of [[military history]] and attempts to derive tangible lessons that could be replicated again with equal success on another battlefield as a sort of bloody laboratory of military science. Few were bloodier than the fields of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] between 1914 and 1918. Fascinatingly the man who probably understood Clausewitz better than most, [[Ferdinand Foch|Marshal Foch]] would initially participate in events that nearly destroyed the [[French Army]].&lt;ref&gt;p.15, Dupuy&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not however true to say that military theorists and commanders were suffering from some collective case of stupidity; quite the opposite is true. Their analysis of military history convinced them that decisive and aggressive strategic offensive was the only [[Military doctrine|doctrine of victory]], and feared that overemphasis of firepower, and the resultant dependence on [[Trench warfare|entrenchment]] would make this all but impossible, and leading to the battlefield stagnant in advantages of the defensive position, destroying troop [[morale]] and willingness to fight.&lt;ref&gt;p.138, Gat&lt;/ref&gt; Because only the offensive could bring victory, lack of it, and not the firepower, was blamed for the defeat of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] in the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. Foch thought that "In strategy as well as in tactics one attacks".&lt;ref&gt;p.138-139, Gat&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ways military science was born as a result of the experiences of the Great War. "Military implements" had changed armies beyond recognition with [[cavalry]] to virtually disappear in the next 20 years. The "supply of an army" would become a science of [[logistics]] in the wake of massive armies, operations and troops that could fire ammunition faster than it could be produced, for the first time using vehicles that used the [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]], a watershed of change.&lt;ref&gt;p.50, Thompson&lt;/ref&gt; Military "organisation" would no longer be that of the linear warfare, but assault teams, and battalions that were becoming multi-skilled with introduction of [[machine gun]] and [[mortar (weapon)|mortar]], and for the first time forcing military commanders to think not only in terms of rank and file, but [[force structure]].

Tactics changed too, with infantry for the first time segregated from the horse-mounted troops, and required to cooperate with [[tank]]s, [[aircraft]] and new [[artillery]] tactics. Perception of [[military discipline]] too had changed. Morale, despite strict disciplinarian attitudes, had cracked in all armies during the war, but best performing troops were found to be those where emphasis on discipline had been replaced with display of personal initiative and group cohesiveness such as that found in the [[Australian Corps]] during the [[Hundred Days Offensive]]. The military sciences' analysis of military history that had failed European commanders was about to give way to a new military science, less conspicuous in appearance, but more aligned to the processes of [[science]] of testing and experimentation, the [[scientific method]], and forever "wed" to the idea of the superiority of technology on the battlefield.

Currently military science still means many things to different organisations. In the United Kingdom and much of the European Union the approach is to relate it closely to the civilian application and understanding. The [[Defence Scientific Advisory Council]] sees this in terms of the fields of science, engineering, technology and analysis (SETA) that includes broad strategic issues, priorities and policies related to developing military capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/AboutDefence/WhatWeDo/ScienceandTechnology/DSAC/|title=Defence Scientific Advisory Council - GOV.UK|website=www.mod.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, for example Belgium's [[Royal Military Academy (Belgium)|Royal Military Academy]], military science remains an academic discipline, and is studied alongside Social Sciences, including such subjects as [[Humanitarian law]]. The United States Department of Defense defines military science in terms of specific systems and operational requirements, and include among other areas [[civil defense]] and force structure.

==Employment of military skills==
In the first instance military science is concerned with who will participate in military operations, and what sets of skills and knowledge they will require to do so effectively and somewhat ingeniously.

===Military organization===
{{Main|Military organization}}
Develops optimal methods for the administration and organization of military units, as well as the military as a whole.  In addition, this area studies other associated aspects as mobilization/demobilization, and military government for areas recently conquered (or liberated) from enemy control.

===Force structuring===
Force structuring is the method by which personnel and the weapons and equipment they use are organized and trained for military operations, including combat. Development of force structure in any country is based on strategic, operational, and tactical needs of the [[national defense policy]], the identified threats to the country, and the technological capabilities of the threats and the armed forces.

Force structure development is guided by doctrinal considerations of strategic, operational and tactical deployment and employment of formations and units to territories, areas and zones where they are expected to perform their missions and tasks. Force structuring applies to all [[Armed Services]], but not to their supporting organisations such as those used for defense science research activities.

In the United States force structure is guided by the [[table of organization and equipment]] (TOE or TO&amp;E). The TOE is a document published by the U.S. Department of Defense which prescribes the organization, manning, and equipage of units from divisional size and down, but also including the headquarters of Corps and Armies.

Force structuring also provides information on the mission and capabilities of specific units, as well as the unit's current status in terms of posture and readiness. A general TOE is applicable to a type of unit (for instance, infantry) rather than a specific unit (the 3rd Infantry Division). In this way, all units of the same branch (such as Infantry) follow the same structural guidelines which allows for more efficient financing, training, and employment of like units operationally.

===Military education and training===
{{Main|Military education and training}}
Studies the methodology and practices involved in training soldiers, NCOs (non-commissioned officers, i.e. sergeants and corporals), and officers.  It also extends this to training small and large units, both individually and in concert with one another for both the regular and reserve organizations.  Military training, especially for officers, also concerns itself with general education and political indoctrination of the armed forces.

==Military concepts and methods==
Much of capability development depends on the concepts which guide use of the armed forces and their weapons and equipment, and the methods employed in any given [[theatre of war]] or combat environment.

===Military history===
{{Main|Military history}}
Military activity has been a constant process over thousands of years, and the essential tactics, strategy, and goals of military operations have been unchanging throughout history. As an example, one notable maneuver is the [[double envelopment]], considered to be the consummate military maneuver, first executed by [[Hannibal]] at the [[Battle of Cannae]] in 216 BCE, and later by [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] at the [[Battle of Walaja]] in 633 CE.

Via the study of history, the military seeks to avoid past mistakes, and improve upon its current performance by instilling an ability in commanders to perceive historical parallels during battle, so as to capitalize on the lessons learned. The main areas military history includes are the history of wars, battles, and combats, history of the military art, and history of each specific military service.

:''Main articles: [[Military strategy]], [[Military doctrine]]''
Military strategy is in many ways the centerpiece of military science. It studies the specifics of planning for, and engaging in combat, and attempts to reduce the many factors to a set of principles that govern all interactions of the field of battle. In Europe these principles were first defined by Clausewitz in his [[Principles of War]]. As such, it directs the planning and execution of battles, operations, and wars as a whole. Two major systems prevail on the planet today. Broadly speaking, these may be described as the "Western" system, and the "Russian" system. Each system reflects and supports strengths and weakness in the underlying society.

Modern Western military art is composed primarily of an amalgam of French, German, British, and American systems.  The Russian system borrows from these systems as well, either through study, or personal observation in the form of invasion ([[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon's War of 1812]], and [[World War II|The Great Patriotic War]]), and form a unique product suited for the conditions practitioners of this system will encounter.  The system that is produced by the analysis provided by Military Art is known as doctrine.

Western military doctrine relies heavily on technology, the use of a well-trained and empowered NCO cadre, and superior information processing and dissemination to provide a level of battlefield awareness that opponents cannot match. Its advantages are extreme flexibility, extreme lethality, and a focus on removing an opponent's [[C4ISTAR|C3I]] (command, communications, control, and intelligence) to paralyze and incapacitate rather than destroying their combat power directly (hopefully saving lives in the process). Its drawbacks are high expense, a reliance on difficult-to-replace personnel, an enormous logistic train, and a difficulty in operating without high technology assets if depleted or destroyed.

Soviet military doctrine (and its descendants, in [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]] countries) relies heavily on masses of machinery and troops, a highly educated (albeit very small) officer corps, and pre-planned missions. Its advantages are that it does not require well educated troops, does not require a large logistic train, is under tight central control, and does not rely on a sophisticated C3I system after the initiation of a course of action. Its disadvantages are inflexibility, a reliance on the shock effect of mass (with a resulting high cost in lives and material), and overall inability to exploit unexpected success or respond to unexpected loss.

Chinese military doctrine is currently in a state of flux as the [[People's Liberation Army]] is evaluating military trends of relevance to China. Chinese military doctrine is influenced by a number of sources including an indigenous classical military tradition characterized by strategists such as [[Sun Tzu]], Western and Soviet influences, as well as indigenous modern strategists such as [[Mao Zedong]]. One distinctive characteristic of Chinese military science is that it places emphasis on the relationship between the military and society as well as viewing military force as merely one part of an overarching [[grand strategy]].

Each system trains its officer corps in its philosophy regarding military art.  The differences in content and emphasis are illustrative. The [[United States Army]] principles of war are defined in the U.S. Army [[List of United States Army Field Manuals#FM 100-5|Field Manual FM&amp;nbsp;100–5]]. The [[Canadian Forces]] principles of war/military science are defined by Land Forces Doctrine and Training System (LFDTS) to focus on ''principles of command'', ''principles of war'', ''operational art and campaign planning'', and ''scientific principles''.

Russian Federation armed forces derive their [[Principles of War|principles of war]] predominantly from those developed during the existence of the Soviet Union. These, although based significantly on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]] experience in conventional war fighting, have been substantially modified since the introduction of the nuclear arms into strategic considerations.  The [[Soviet–Afghan War]] and the [[First Chechen War|First]] and [[Second Chechen War]]s further modified the principles that Soviet theorists had divided into the operational art and tactics. The very scientific approach to military science thinking in the Soviet union had been perceived as overly rigid at the [[military tactics|tactical level]], and had affected the training in the Russian Federation's much reduced forces to instil greater professionalism and initiative in the forces.

The military [[Principles of War|principles of war]] of the People's Liberation Army were loosely based on those of the Soviet Union until the 1980s when a significant shift begun to be seen in a more regionally-aware, and geographically-specific strategic, operational and tactical thinking in all services. The PLA is currently influenced by three doctrinal schools which both conflict and complement each other: the People's war, the Regional war, and the Revolution in military affairs that led to substantial increase in the defense spending and rate of technological modernisation of the forces.

The differences in the specifics of Military art notwithstanding, Military science strives to provide an integrated picture of the chaos of battle, and illuminate basic insights that apply to all combatants, not just those who agree with your formulation of the principles.

===Military geography===
{{Main|Military geography}}
Military geography encompasses much more than simple protestations to take the high ground. Military geography studies the obvious, the geography of theatres of war, but also the additional characteristics of politics, economics, and other natural features of locations of likely conflict (the political "landscape", for example).  As an example, the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] was predicated on the ability of the Soviet Union to not only successfully invade Afghanistan, but also to militarily and politically flank the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]] simultaneously.

==Military systems==
How effectively and efficiently militaries accomplish their operations, missions and tasks is closely related not only to the methods they use, but the equipment and weapons they use.

===Military intelligence===
Military intelligence supports the [[Combat Arms|combat]] commanders' [[decision making process]] by providing [[intelligence analysis]] of [[Intelligence (information gathering)|available data]] from a wide range of sources. To provide that informed analysis the commanders information requirements are identified and input to a process of gathering, analysis, protection, and dissemination of information about the operational environment, hostile, friendly and neutral forces and the civilian population in an area of combat operations, and broader area of interest. Intelligence activities are conducted at all levels from tactical to strategic, in peacetime, the period of transition to war, and during the war.

Most militaries maintain a military intelligence capability to provide analytical and information collection personnel in both specialist units and from other arms and services.  Personnel selected for intelligence duties, whether specialist [[intelligence officer]]s and enlisted soldiers or non-specialist assigned to intelligence may be selected for their analytical abilities and intelligence before receiving formal training.

Military intelligence serves to identify the threat, and provide information on understanding best methods and weapons to use in deterring or defeating it.

===Military logistics===
{{Main|Military logistics}}
The art and science of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of military forces. In its most comprehensive sense, it is those aspects or military operations that deal with the design, development, acquisition, storage, distribution, maintenance, evacuation, and disposition of material; the movement, evacuation, and hospitalization of personnel; the acquisition or construction, maintenance, operation, and disposition of facilities; and the acquisition or furnishing of services.

===Military technology and equipment===
{{Main|Military technology}}
Military technology is not just the study of various technologies and applicable physical sciences used to increase military power.  It may also extend to the study of production methods of military equipment, and ways to improve performance and reduce material and/or technological requirements for its production.  An example is the effort expended by [[Nazism|Nazi]] Germany to produce artificial rubbers and fuels to reduce or eliminate their dependence on imported POL (petroleum, oil, and lubricants) and rubber supplies.

Military technology is unique only in its application, not in its use of basic scientific and technological achievements.  Because of the uniqueness of use, military technological studies strive to incorporate evolutionary, as well as the rare revolutionary technologies, into their proper place of military application.

'''''My Mom's Having a Baby''''' is an American television teen comedy/documentary that aired as an ''[[ABC Afterschool Special]]'' on February 16, 1977. The program would be historic as it was the first television program of its kind in the [[United States]] to showcase the pregnancy process and conception to young people, using a combination of animation and live action. The program was a co-production between [[Dick Clark Productions]] and [[DePatie-Freleng Enterprises]].

==Premise==
Upon learning that his mother is pregnant with what will be his brother, 10-year-old Petey Evans begins to wonder (through animated fantasies and flashbacks) about how babies are born, only to realize that those theories are not delivered by storks or popping out of a stomach. So, with help from his friends Oskar and Kelly, they go to a real expert who will be performing the delivery, Dr. [[Lendon Smith]], who uses an animated film that explains in detail (via Smith's narration) of how a pregnancy begins and how the child is conceived.

The remaining portion of this program features an actual live birth being performed in front of the cameras, which was taken from a 1974 [[ABC's Wide World of Entertainment]] special called ''[[David Hartman (TV personality)|David Hartman]]: Birth &amp; Babies''.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Ledger]] (Lakeland, Florida): "Actual Birth of Baby to be Televised", February 13, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/20/arts/television-the-quiet-life-as-pursued-by-david-hartman.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "Television — The Quiet Life as Pursued by David Hartman"] From New York Times (August 20, 1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Actress Candace Farrell, who played the mother in this program, was pregnant at the time of filming the 1974 special, which resulted in the producers hiring her for this program.

==Awards==
*This program won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] in 1977 for Outstanding Children's Informational Special.

==Cast==
*Shane Sinutko as Petey Evans
*Jarred Johnson as Oskar
*Rachael Longaker as Kelly
*Lendon Smith as himself
*Candace Farrell as Anne Evans

'''Nicolaas II Rockox''' (1560–1640), knight, was a mayor of [[Antwerp]]. He is known to have been a personal friend of [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and was the first resident of the [[Rockox House]].

== Family ==
{{main|Rockox family}}
He was the son of Adrian II and Isabella van Olmen and a nephew of [[John III van de Werve, Lord of Hovorst]]. He was a first cousin of [[Lancelot II of Ursel]], mayor of Antwerp.

In 1589, in [[Antwerp Cathedral]], he married Adriana Perez (1568–1619), child of the rich Spanish merchant Luis Perez (1532–1601) and Maria van Berchem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liechtensteincollections.at/en/pages/artbase_main.asp?module=browse&amp;action=m_work&amp;lang=en&amp;sid=87294&amp;oid=W-342008235234370 |title=Liechtenstein. The Princely Collections |publisher=Liechtensteincollections.at |date= |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died without children in the Rockox House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balat.kikirpa.be/photo.php?path=M088532&amp;objnr=60730&amp;nr=3 |title=Balat Kik-Irpa |publisher=Balat.kikirpa.be |date= |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Rockox studied in Douai and Leuven, completing his law studies on 24 August 1584.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tento.be/OKV-artikel/nicolaas-rockox-1560%E2%80%931640-burgemeester-van-de-gouden-eeuw |title=Nicolaas Rockox (1560–1640) - Burgemeester van de Gouden Eeuw |language=nl |publisher=www.tento.be |date=2010-12-14 |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the civic militia and defended the city in service of [[Philips of Marnix, Lord of Saint-Aldegonde]] when [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], attacked Antwerp. 
Rockox studied the fortifications from [[Jean Errard]],&lt;ref&gt;La fortification démonstrée et réduicte en art / par feu J. Errard&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bar-le-Duc]] and had the outer walls of Antwerp repaired and improved.

In 1590, he was knighted by the Archdukes [[Albert VII, Archduke of Austria|Albert]] and [[Isabella Clara Eugenia|Isabella]]. He was put on the list of honours when their [[Blijde Inkomst|Joyous Entry]] took place.

In 1603 Rockox bought the house named ''Gulden Rinck'' and developed it into his main residence, now known as the [[Rockox House]]. It housed an important collection of art and of curiosities, famous in his own time. His collection included a ''[[Samson and Delilah (Rubens)|Samson and Delilah]]'' painted for him by his friend Rubens. After 1608 the friendship between them was very close. Rockox commissioned several paintings from him, including ''[[The Incredulity of Saint Thomas (Rubens)|The Incredulity of Saint Thomas]]''. Other friends of Rockox include [[Abraham Ortelius]], who taught him the art of [[numismatics]], and the young [[Anthony van Dyck]], who painted several portraits for him.

Rockox served several terms as [[List of mayors of Antwerp|mayor of Antwerp]]. He died in the Rockox House and was buried in the church of the [[Recollects Convent, Antwerp|Recollect convent]], where he had had a private chapel built for his deceased wife in 1619.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Biografieën Collectie Onderzoek Beleef meer |url=http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/nl/collectie/nicolaas-rockox-0 |title=Nicolaas Rockox &amp;#124; Barok in de Zuidelijke Nederlanden |publisher=Barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be |date= |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he had no children, his property was given to the poor, in devotion. During his life Rockox spent an important part of his private fortune to benefit the poor. He commanded that a public reserve of grain be prepared for the poor in case of war or siege. He paid 45,300 florins for this from his private fortune. After his death his famous collection of artworks spread to other collections worldwide.

== Patronage ==
Rockox commissioned multiple paintings from [[Peter Paul Rubens]]. Some of these commissions were for the public, while others were for his private residence. Among those he commissioned for the public included ''[[Adoration of the Magi (Rubens, Madrid)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' for the Antwerp City Hall, ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rubens)|Descent from the Cross]]'' for the city's Arquebusiers' Guild's altar, and ''Doubting Thomas'' for Rockox's chapel. Rockox's private commissions from Rubens included ''[[Samson and Delilah (Rubens)|Samson and Delilah]]''. At the time of his death, Rockox had 87 works in his personal collection. Other artists represented within this collection included [[Anthony van Dyck]], [[Frans Snyders]], [[Jan van Eyck]], and [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]]. After his death, his art collection was sold publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Veronique van Passel, "Rockox, Nicolaas", ''Grove Art Online''. Oxford University Press. Web. 28 Feb. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemoration==
In 1961 Rockox was put on a Belgian stamp.

In botany, the phrase '''''ordo naturalis''''', "natural order", was once used for what today is a [[family (biology)|family]]. Its origins lie with [[Carl Linnaeus]] who used the word when he referred to natural groups of plants in his lesser-known work, particularly ''[[Philosophia Botanica]]''. In his more famous works the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'', plants were arranged according to his artificial "Sexual system", and Linnaeus used the word "ordo" for an artificial unit. In those works, only genera and species (sometimes varieties) were "real" [[taxa]].

In nineteenth-century works such as the ''[[de Candolle system|Prodromus]]'' of de Candolle and the ''[[Bentham &amp; Hooker system|Genera Plantarum]]'' of Bentham &amp; Hooker, the word ''ordo'' did indicate taxa that are now given the rank of family. Contemporary French works used the word "famille" for these same taxa.  In the first international ''Rules'' of [[botanical nomenclature]] of 1906 the word family (''familia'') was assigned to this rank, while the term "order" (''ordo'') was reserved for a higher rank, for what in the nineteenth century had often been named a ''cohors'' (plural ''cohortes'').

The ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]'' provides for names published in the rank of ''ordo naturalis'' in Art 18.2: normally, these are to be accepted as family names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=McNeill, J. |author2=Barrie, F.R. |author3=Buck, W.R. |author4=Demoulin, V. |author5=Greuter, W. |author6=Hawksworth, D.L. |author7=Herendeen, P.S. |author8=Knapp, S. |author9=Marhold, K. |author10=Prado, J. |author11=Prud'homme Van Reine, W.F. |author12=Smith, G.F. |author13=Wiersema, J.H. |author14=Turland, N.J. |year=2012 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile 154 |title=International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code) adopted by the Eighteenth International Botanical Congress Melbourne, Australia, July 2011 |publisher=A.R.G.

Some plant families retain the name they were given by pre-Linnaean authors, recognised by Linnaeus as "natural orders" (e.g. ''[[Palmae]]'' or ''[[Labiatae]]''). Such names are known as [[Descriptive botanical names|descriptive]] family names.

'''Patriarchy''' is a [[social system]] in which males hold primary power and predominate in roles of political leadership, [[moral authority]], [[social privilege]] and control of property. Some patriarchal societies are also [[patrilineal]], meaning that property and title are inherited by the male lineage.

Patriarchy is associated with a set of ideas, a patriarchal [[ideology]] that acts to explain and justify this dominance and attributes it to inherent natural differences between men and women. Sociologists tend to see patriarchy as a social product and not as an outcome of innate differences between the sexes and they focus attention on the way that [[gender role]]s in a society affect power differentials between men and women.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Henslin"/&gt;

Historically, patriarchy has manifested itself in the social, legal, political, religious, and economic organization of a range of different cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Malti-Douglas |first=Fedwa |title=Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender |year=2007 |publisher= Macmillan |location=Detroit |isbn=0-02-865960-0}}{{Page needed |date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if not explicitly defined to be by their own constitutions and laws, most contemporary societies are, in practice, patriarchal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Societies, Networks, and Transitions |volume=1 |last=Lockard |first=Craig |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2007 |isbn=9780547047669 |location= |pages=111–114 |quote="Today, as in the past, men generally hold political, economic, and religious power in most societies." }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Wiley Blackwell Encyclopedia of Gender and Sexuality Studies|first1=Carole|last1=Pateman|title=Sexual Contract|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=2016|location=Singapore|isbn=978-1-4051-9694-9|doi=10.1002/9781118663219.wbegss468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the term ''patriarchy'' was used to refer to [[autocratic]] rule by the male head of a family.

[[Marxist]] theory, as articulated mainly by [[Friedrich Engels]], assigns the origin of patriarchy to the emergence of [[private property]], which has traditionally been controlled by men. In this view, men directed household production and sought to control women in order to ensure the passing of family property to their own (male) offspring, while women were limited to household labor and producing children.{{refn|name=Cannell &amp; Green}}{{refn|name=Gardiner}}&lt;ref name="Bryson"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bryson |first=Valerie |editor1=Kramarae, Cheris |editor2=Spender, Dale |title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge, Volume 2 |date=2000 |location=New York; Abingdon, UK |isbn=978-0-41-5-92088-9 |page=791 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books/about/Routledge_International_Encyclopedia_of.html?id=QAOUAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT850&amp;dq=patriarchy |chapter=Feminism: Marxist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lerner disputes this idea, arguing that patriarchy emerged before the development of class-based society and the concept of private property.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13323175|title=The creation of patriarchy|last=1920-2013.|first=Lerner, Gerda,|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0195039963|location=New York|oclc=13323175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Domination by men of women is found in the [[Ancient Near East]] as far back as 3100 BCE, as are restrictions on a woman's reproductive capacity and exclusion from "the process of representing or the construction of history".&lt;ref name="Strozier"/&gt; According to some researchers, with the appearance of the [[Hebrews]], there is also "the exclusion of woman from the God-humanity covenant".&lt;ref name="Strozier"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner |first=Gerda |year=1986 |url=https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=Zc318kI-TPMC |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |publisher=Oxford University Press |series=Women and History |isbn=978-0195039962 |pages=8–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] argues that waves of [[kurgan hypothesis|kurgan]]-building invaders from the Ukrainian steppes into the early agricultural cultures of [[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old Europe]] in the Aegean, the Balkans and southern Italy instituted male hierarchies that led to the rise of patriarchy in [[Western society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gimbutas |first=Marija | chapter = The end of Old Europe: the intrusion of Steppe Pastoralists from South Russia and the transformation of Europe | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ktftAAAAMAAJ |title=The Civilization of the Goddess: The World of Old Europe | pages = 351&amp;ndash;510 |publisher=Harper Collins | location = San Francisco, California |year=1992 |isbn=978-0062503374}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven Taylor argues that the rise of patriarchal domination was associated with the appearance of socially stratified hierarchical polities, institutionalised violence and the separated individuated ego associated with a period of climatic stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Steven | chapter = What's wrong with human beings? | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mSPtBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT12 |title=The Fall: The Insanity of the Ego in Human History | pages = 17&amp;ndash;19 | publisher = O Books | location = Winchester | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-1905047208 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient history===
A prominent Greek general [[Meno (general)|Meno]], in the Platonic dialogue of the same name, sums up the prevailing sentiment in [[Classical Greece]] about the respective virtues of men and women. He says:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W.R.M.

Or take a woman's virtue: there is no difficulty in describing it as the duty of ordering the house well, looking after the property indoors, and obeying her husband. | Meno | Plato in Twelve Volumes}}

The works of [[Aristotle]] portrayed women as morally, intellectually, and physically inferior to men; saw women as the property of men; claimed that women's role in society was to reproduce and to serve men in the household; and saw male domination of women as natural and virtuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fishbein, Harold D.|title=Peer prejudice and discrimination: the origins of prejudice|edition= 2nd|publisher=Psychology Press|date=2002|isbn=978-0-8058-3772-8|page=27|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBwAYLFPP3sC&amp;pg=PA27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dubber, Markus Dirk|title=The police power: patriarchy and the foundations of American government|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13207-7|pages=5–7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cjdbRF8PXhUC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bar On, Bat-Ami|title=Engendering origins: critical feminist readings in Plato and Aristotle|publisher=SUNY Press|date=1994|isbn=978-0-7914-1643-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6UVq3z2Kd6cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], author of ''The Creation of Patriarchy,'' states that Aristotle believed that women had colder blood than men, which made women not evolve into men, the sex that Aristotle believed to be perfect and superior. Maryanne Cline Horowitz stated that Aristotle believed that "soul contributes the form and model of creation". This implies that any imperfection that is caused in the world must be caused by a woman because one cannot acquire an imperfection from perfection (which he perceived as male). Aristotle had a hierarchical ruling structure in his theories. Lerner claims that through this patriarchal belief system, passed down generation to generation, people have been conditioned to believe that men are superior to women. These symbols are benchmarks which children learn about when they grow up, and the cycle of patriarchy continues much past the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Lerner1986"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lerner, |first=Gerda |date=1986 |title=The Creation of Patriarchy |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Chapter 10: Symbols}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Egypt]] left no philosophical record, but [[Herodotus]] left a record of his shock at the contrast between the roles of Egyptian women and the women of Athens. He observed that Egyptian women attended market and were employed in [[trade]]. In ancient Egypt, middle-class women were eligible to sit on a local [[tribunal]], engage in [[real estate]] transactions, and inherit or bequeath [[property]]. Women also secured loans, and witnessed legal documents. Athenian women were denied such rights.&lt;ref&gt;Ptahhotep, trans. John A. Wilson.

During this time period in China, gender roles and patriarchy remained shaped by Confucianism.

Although many 16th and 17th century theorists agreed with Aristotle's views concerning the place of women in society, none of them tried to prove political obligation on the basis of the patriarchal family until sometime after 1680. The patriarchal political theory is closely associated with Sir [[Robert Filmer]]. Sometime before 1653, Filmer completed a work entitled ''Patriarcha''. However, it was not published until after his death. In it, he defended the divine right of kings as having title inherited from [[Adam]], the first man of the human species, according to [[Judeo-Christian]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Gordon|first=Schochet|title=Patriarchy and Paternalism|encyclopedia=Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World|date=2004|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|isbn=068431200X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in the latter half of the 18th century, clerical sentiments of patriarchy were meeting challenges from intellectual authorities – [[Diderot]]'s [[Encyclopedia]] denies inheritance of paternal authority stating, "... reason shows us that mothers have rights and authority equal to those of fathers; for the obligations imposed on children originate equally from the mother and the father, as both are equally responsible for bringing them into the world. Thus the positive laws of God that relate to the obedience of children join the father and the mother without any differentiation; both possess a kind of ascendancy and jurisdiction over their children...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Encyclopedie, Paternal Authority|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/d/did/did2222.0000.040/--paternal-authority?rgn=main;view=fulltext;q1=education|publisher=Digital Library Platform &amp; Services (DLPS), University of Michigan |accessdate=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, various women began to question the commonly accepted patriarchal interpretation of Christian scripture. One of the foremost of these was [[Sarah Grimké]], who voiced skepticism about the ability of men to translate and interpret passages relating to the roles of the sexes without bias. She proposed alternative translations and interpretations of passages relating to women, and she applied historical and cultural criticism to a number of verses, arguing that their admonitions applied to specific historical situations, and were not to be viewed as universal commands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durso|first=Pamela R.|title=The Power of Woman: The Life and writings of Sarah Moore Grimké|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQFTJJgK8esC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2003|publisher=Mercer University Press|location=Macon, Ga.|isbn=978-0-86554-876-3|pages=130–138|edition= 1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]] used Grimké's criticism of biblical sources to establish a basis for feminist thought. She published ''[[The Woman's Bible]]'', which proposed a feminist reading of the Old and New Testament. This tendency was enlarged by feminist theory, which denounced the patriarchal Judeo-Christian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Castro, Ginette|title=American Feminism: a contemporary history|publisher=NYU Press|date=1990|isbn=|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his essay, ''A Judicial Patriarchy: Family Law at the Turn of the Century'', Michael Grossberg coined the phrase ''judicial patriarchy'' stating that, "The judge became the buffer between the family and the state." and that, "Judicial patriarchs dominated family law because within these institutional and intraclass rivalries judges succeeded in protecting their power over the law governing the hearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gossberg | first = Michael | chapter = A judicial patriarchy: family law at the turn of the century | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=bCHkkM1dRYgC&amp;pg=PA289 | editor-last = Grossberg | editor-first = Michael | title = Governing the hearth: law and the family in nineteenth-century America | pages = 289&amp;ndash;307 | publisher = The University of North Carolina Press | location = Chapel Hill London | date = 1985 | isbn = 9780807863367 }}

In China's [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]], laws governing morality, sexuality, and gender-relations continued to be based on Confucian teachings. Men and women were both subject to strict laws regarding sexual behavior, however men were punished infrequently in comparison to women. Additionally, women's punishment often carried strong social stigma, "rendering [women] unmarriageable," a stigma which did not follow men.&lt;ref&gt;Ruskola, Teemu. “Law, Sexual Morality, and Gender Equality in Qing and Communist China.” ''The Yale Law Journal'', vol. 103, no. 8, 1994, pp. 2531–2565.

In the modern era, the concept of Patriarchy is asserted to manifest itself in [[Institutionalisation|institutionalized]] control, rather than simply being about an individual's sexism.

==Feminist theory==
Feminist theorists have written extensively about patriarchy either as a primary cause of women's oppression, or as part of an interactive system. [[Shulamith Firestone]], a radical-libertarian feminist, defines patriarchy as a system of oppression of women. Firestone believes that patriarchy is caused by the biological inequalities between women and men, e.g. that women bear children, while men do not. Firestone writes that patriarchal ideologies support the oppression of women and gives as an example the joy of giving birth, which she labels a patriarchal myth. For Firestone, women must gain control over reproduction in order to be free from oppression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]] believes that male control over women's sexuality and reproductive functions is a fundamental cause and result of patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Alison Jaggar]] also understands patriarchy as the primary cause of women's oppression. The system of patriarchy accomplishes this by alienating women from their bodies.

Interactive systems theorists [[Iris Marion Young]] and [[Heidi Hartmann]] believe that patriarchy and capitalism interact together to oppress women. Young, Hartmann, and other [[Socialist feminism|socialist]] and [[Marxist feminism|Marxist feminists]] use the terms ''patriarchal capitalism'' or ''capitalist patriarchy'' to describe the interactive relationship of capitalism and patriarchy in producing and reproducing the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Tong"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|last=Rosemarie|first=Tong|publisher=|others=Botts, Tina Fernandes|date=2017-07-18|isbn=9780813350707|edition= Fifth |location=New York|pages=|oclc=979993556}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Hartmann, the term ''patriarchy'' redirects the focus of oppression from the labour division to a moral and political responsibility liable directly to men as a gender. In its being both systematic and universal, therefore, the concept of patriarchy represents an adaptation of the Marxist concept of class and class struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hartmann |first1=Heidi |title=The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism |journal=Capital and Class |volume=8 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[Audre Lorde]], an African American feminist writer and theorist, believed that [[racism]] and patriarchy were intertwined systems of oppression.&lt;ref name="Tong" /&gt; [[Sara Ruddick]], a philosopher who wrote about "good mothers" in the context of maternal ethics, describes the dilemma facing contemporary mothers who must train their children within a patriarchal system. Does a "good mother," she asks, train her son to be competitive, individualistic, and comfortable within the hierarchies of patriarchy, knowing that he may likely be economically successful but a mean person? Or does a good mother resist patriarchal ideologies and socialize her son to be cooperative and communal but economically unsuccessful?&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Gerda Lerner]], in her 1986 ''The Creation of Patriarchy'', makes a series of arguments about the origins and reproduction of patriarchy as a system of oppression of women, and concludes that patriarchy is socially constructed and seen as natural and invisible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Some feminist theorists believe that patriarchy is an unjust social system that is harmful to both men and women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David A. J. Richards|title=Resisting Injustice and the Feminist Ethics of Care in the Age of Obama: "Suddenly ...

Because patriarchy is a social construction, it can be overcome by revealing and critically analyzing its manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tickner, Ann J.|chapter=Patriarchy|title=Routledge Encyclopedia of International Political Economy: Entries P-Z|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=2001|isbn=978-0-415-24352-0|pages=1197–1198|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lSmU3aXWIAYC&amp;pg=PA1197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jaggar, Young, and Hartmann are among the feminist theorists who argue that the system of patriarchy should be completely overturned, especially the [[Heteropatriarchy|heteropatriarchal]] family, which they see as a necessary component of female oppression. The family not only serves as a representative of the greater civilization by pushing its own affiliates to change and obey, but performs as a component in the rule of the patriarchal state that rules its inhabitants with the head of the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org|title=Violence against Women and Media: Advancements and Challenges of a Research and Political Agenda|last=Montiel|first=Aimée Vega|date=8 October 2014|publisher=UNESCO }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many feminists (especially scholars and activists) have called for culture repositioning as a method for deconstructing patriarchy. Culture repositioning relates to [[culture change]]. It involves the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chigbu|first=Uchendu Eugene|title=Repositioning culture for development: women and development in a Nigerian rural community|journal=Community, Work &amp; Family|date=2015|volume=18|issue=3|pages=334–350|doi=10.1080/13668803.2014.981506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the widespread use of the term ''patriarchy'', early feminists used ''male [[chauvinism]]'' and ''sexism'' to refer roughly to the same phenomenon.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25"&gt;{{cite book|last=hooks | first = bell|chapter=Understanding patriarchy|chapterurl=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=G28LTQltyVAC&amp;pg=PA17|title=The will to change: men, masculinity, and love|publisher=Washington Square Press|date=2004|pages=17–25|isbn=9780743480338|quote=Patriarchy is a political-social system that insists that males are inherently dominating, superior to everything and everyone deemed weak, especially females, and endowed with the right to dominate and rule over the weak and to maintain that dominance through various forms of psychological terrorism and violence.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[bell hooks]] argues that the new term identifies the ideological system itself (that men claim dominance and superiority to women) that can be believed and acted upon by either men or women, whereas the earlier terms imply only men act as oppressors of women.&lt;ref name="hooks, bell 2004 17–25" /&gt;

Sociologist Joan Acker, analyzing the concept of patriarchy and the role that it has played in the development of feminist thought, says that seeing  patriarchy as a universal, trans-historical and trans-cultural phenomenon where "women were everywhere oppressed by men in more or less the same ways […] tended toward a biological essentialism.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Acker |first1=John |title=The Problem with Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1989 |volume=23 |issue=2 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Pollart has described attempts the use of patriarchy as circular and conflating description and explanation. She remarks the discourse on patriarchy creates a ‘theoretical impasse […] imposing a structural label on what it is supposed to explain’ and therefore impoverishes the possibility to explain gender inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pollart |first1=Anne |title=Gender and Class Revisited, or the Poverty of Patriarchy |journal=Sociology |date=1996 |volume=30 |issue=4 |page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological versus social theories==
{{Main|Sex differences in humans|Social construction of gender difference}}

As a common standard of differentiation between sexes, advocates for a patriarchal society like to focus on the influences that hormones have over biological systems.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Hormones have been declared as the "key to the sexual universe" because they are present in all animals and are the driving force in two critical developmental stages: sex-determinism in the fetus, and puberty in the teenage individual.&lt;ref name=Lewontin&gt;{{cite book | chapter = The determined patriarchy | chapterurl = https://athens.indymedia.org/media/upload/2016/09/06/Steven_Rose_Richard_Lewontin_Leon_J._Kamin-Not_In_Our_Genes__Biology_Ideology_and_Human_Nature__-Penguin_Books_Ltd_1990.pdf | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = Richard C. | last2 = Rose | first2 = Steven | last3 = Kamin | first3 = Leon J. | author-link1 = Richard Lewontin | title = Not in our genes: biology, ideology, and human nature | pages = 132&amp;ndash;163 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | date = 1984 | isbn = 9780140226058 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing a critical role in the development of the brain and behavior, testosterone and estrogen have been labeled the "male-hormone" and "female-hormone" respectively as a result of the impact they have when masculinizing or feminizing an individual.

Sociologists tend to reject predominantly biological explanations of patriarchy&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Macionis, John J. (2012). ''Sociology'' (13th ed.). Prentice Hall. {{ISBN|0205181090}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contend that socialization processes are primarily responsible for establishing [[gender roles]].&lt;ref name="Henslin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Essentials of Sociology|first=James M.|last=Henslin|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|date=2001|pages=65–67, 240|isbn=9780536941855}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to standard sociological theory, patriarchy is the result of sociological constructions that are passed down from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="Sanderson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Evolution of Human Sociality|last=Sanderson|first=Stephen K.|date=2001|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780847695348|location=Lanham, Maryland|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; These constructions are most pronounced in societies with traditional cultures and less economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sociology: A Global Introduction|first1=John J.|last1=Macionis|last2=Plummer |first2 = Ken |publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Harlow|date=2000|page=347|isbn= 9780130407375}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in modern, developed societies, however, gender messages conveyed by family, mass media, and other institutions largely favor males having a dominant status.&lt;ref name="Henslin"/&gt;

Biologist [[Richard Lewontin]] asserts that patriarchy persists through social and political reasons, rather than purely biological causes. Opponents of [[gender feminism]], such as [[Christina Hoff Sommers]], have argued that patriarchy has its origin in biological factors.&lt;ref name=Hoff_Sommers&gt;{{cite book |author=Sommers, Christina Hoff |authorlink=Christina Hoff Sommers |title=Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women |date=1995 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-684-80156-8 |page=320|title-link=Who Stole Feminism? How Women Have Betrayed Women }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Undue weight inline|Independent source preferred|date=September 2018}}

This is called [[biological determinism]], which looks at humanity from a strictly biological point of view. Thus, the evolution of science in a patriarchal society's focus begins with man and woman. The male [[testosterone]] hormone is, for instance, known to greatly enhance risk taking behaviour; which can generate increased status in groups if successful (balanced with an equal increase in number of failures, with potential losses of status or death as result). The potential magnitude, frequency and longevity of the increased status from a hormonally driven risk-taking success depends on opportunities, which increases rapidly with societal complexity.

A hypothetical patriarchal culture based primarily on a hormonally-driven increased rate of male successes, thus require a certain critical level of societal evolution{{clarify|date=May 2016}} before it could evolve. Other proponents of this theory posit that because of a woman's biology, she is more fit to perform roles such as anonymous child-rearing at home, rather than high-profile decision-making roles, such as leaders in battles. Through this simple basis, "the existence of a sexual division of labor in primitive societies is a starting point as much for purely social accounts of the origins of patriarchy as for biological."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} Hence, the rise of patriarchy is recognized through this apparent "sexual division".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;

Although patriarchy exists within the scientific atmosphere, "the periods over which women would have been at a physiological disadvantage in participation in hunting through being at a late stage of pregnancy or early stage of child-rearing would have been short",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|157}} during the time of the nomads, patriarchy still grew with power. Lewontin and others argue that such biological determinism unjustly limits women. In his study, he states women behave a certain way not because they are biologically inclined to, but rather because they are judged by "how well they conform to the stereotypical local image of femininity".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|137}}

Feminists believe that people have gendered biases, which are perpetuated and enforced across generations by those who benefit from them.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; For instance, it has historically been claimed that women cannot make rational decisions during their menstrual periods. This claim cloaks the fact that men also have periods of time where they can be aggressive and irrational; furthermore, unrelated effects of aging and similar medical problems are often blamed on menopause, amplifying its reputation.&lt;ref name=Coney&gt;{{cite book | last = Coney | first = Sandra | title = The menopause industry: how the medical establishment exploits women | publisher = Hunter House | location = Alameda, California | date = 1994 | isbn = 9780897931618 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These biological traits and others specific to women, such as their ability to get pregnant, are often used against them as an attribute of weakness.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coney" /&gt;

A growing body of research has found key points of the biological argument to be groundless. For example, it was asserted for over a century that women were not as intellectually competent as men because they have slightly smaller brains on average.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"&gt;{{cite book |last= Gould | first= Stephen |title= The panda's thumb: more reflections in natural history |pages= 152–159 |publisher= Norton |location = New York |date= 1992 |origyear= 1980 |isbn= 978-0393340839 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no substantiated significant difference in average intelligence has been found between the sexes. On the other hand, men have a greater variability in intelligence, and except in tests of reading comprehension, in tests of perceptual speed and associative memory, males typically outnumber females substantially among high-scoring individuals.&lt;ref name="Hedges and Nowell"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hedges | first1 = Larry V. | last2 = Nowell | first2 = Amy | title = Sex differences in mental test scores, variability, and numbers of high-scoring individuals | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 269 | issue = 5220 | pages = 41&amp;ndash;45 | doi = 10.1126/science.7604277 | pmid = 7604277 | jstor = 2889145 | date = 7 July 1995 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, no discrepancy in intelligence is assumed between men of different heights, even though on average taller men have been found to have slightly larger brains.&lt;ref name="Gould1980"/&gt; Feminists assert that although women may excel in certain areas and men in others, women are just as competent as men.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Therefore, through the growing power of the patriarchal system, a gender bias is created in the work force, leading to a situation in which "men are more likely to be cabinet ministers or parliamentarians, business executives or tycoons, Nobel Prize-winning scientists or fellows of academies, doctors or airline pilots. [As for] [w]omen [they] are more likely to be secretaries, laboratory technicians, office cleaners, nurses, airline stewardesses, primary school teachers, or social workers."&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|132}}

Within the structure of a patriarchal society, patriarchal biases and values are more likely to be promoted in the educational system. Particularly in mathematical and scientific fields, boys are presumed to have more keen spatial abilities than girls, whereas girls are supposed to assume better linguistic skills. These stereotypical manifestations within educational institutions contract with the notions of differently gendered brains and a "relationship between intelligence and brain size".&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} However, there is "no correlation between skull capacity and hence brain weight and 'intellectual power'",&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt;{{rp|143}} yet there is still a constant struggle of gender bias in science.

Sociologist [[Sylvia Walby]] has composed six overlapping structures that define patriarchy and that take different forms in different cultures and different times:
# The state: women are unlikely to have formal power and representation
# The household: women are more likely to do the housework and raise the children
# Violence: women are more prone to being abused
# Paid work: women are likely to be paid less
# Sexuality: women's sexuality is more likely to be treated negatively
# Culture: representation of women in media, and popular culture is "within a patriarchal gaze".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Walby | first = Sylvia | title = Theorizing patriarchy |page=20 | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | location = Oxford, UK Cambridge, Massachusetts | date = 1990 | isbn = 9780631147688 }}

Some [[sociobiologist]]s, such as [[Steven Goldberg]], argue that social behavior is primarily determined by [[genetics]], and thus that patriarchy arises more as a result of inherent biology than social conditioning. Goldberg also contends that patriarchy is a universal feature of human culture. In 1973, Goldberg wrote, "The ethnographic studies of every society that has ever been observed explicitly state that these feelings were present, there is literally no variation at all."&lt;ref name="Goldberg, Steven"&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldberg | first = Steven | title = The inevitability of patriarchy | publisher = W. Morrow | location = New York | date = 1974 | isbn = 9780688051754 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg has critics among anthropologists. Concerning Goldberg's claims about the "feelings of both men and women", [[Eleanor Leacock]] countered in 1974 that the data on women's attitudes are "sparse and contradictory", and that the data on male attitudes about male–female relations are "ambiguous". Also, the effects of colonialism on the cultures represented in the studies were not considered.&lt;ref name="Leacock, Eleanor"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Leacock | first = Eleanor | author-link = Eleanor Leacock | title = Reviewed Work: ''The Inevitability of Patriarchy'' by Steven Goldberg | journal = [[American Anthropologist]] | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 363&amp;ndash;365 | doi = 10.1525/aa.1974.76.2.02a00280 | jstor = 674209 | date = June 1974 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early theory in [[evolutionary psychology]] offered an explanation for the origin of patriarchy which starts with the view that females almost always invest more energy into producing offspring than males, and therefore in most [[species]] females are a [[limiting factor]] over which males will compete. This is sometimes referred to as [[Bateman's principle]]. It suggests females place the most important preference on males who control more resources that can help her and her offspring, which in turn causes an [[evolutionary pressure]] on males to be competitive with each other in order to gain resources and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = David Michael | last2 = Schmitt | first2 = David P. | title = Evolutionary psychology and feminism | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 64 | issue = 9&amp;ndash;10 | pages = 768&amp;ndash;787 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-011-9987-3 | date = May 2011 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that patriarchy is natural has, however, come under attack from many sociologists, explaining that patriarchy evolved due to historical, rather than biological, conditions. In technologically simple societies, men's greater physical strength and women's common experience of pregnancy combined together to sustain patriarchy.&lt;ref name="Lewontin" /&gt; Gradually, technological advances, especially industrial machinery, diminished the primacy of physical strength in everyday life. Similarly, contraception has given women control over their reproductive cycle.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

There is considerable variation in the role that gender plays in human societies. The ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' states, "The consensus among modern anthropologists and sociologists is that while many cultures bestow power preferentially on one sex or the other, matriarchal societies in this original, evolutionary sense have never existed."&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Matriarchy|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|date=2018|accessdate=June 23, 2018|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/matriarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The masculinities scholar [[David Buchbinder]] suggests that [[Roland Barthes]]' description of the term ''[[ex-nomination]]'' (i.e. patriarchy as the 'norm' or common sense) is relevant, "[f]or as long as patriarchy remained tacit as a key principle of experiencing gender difference and hence a dominant discourse in the organization of society, it was difficult to contest its power."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Buchbinder | first = David | author-link = David Buchbinder | chapter = Troubling patriarchy | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TmfUzE4WnW8C&amp;pg=PA106 | title = Studying men and masculinities | pages = 106–107 | publisher = Routledge | location = Abingdon, Oxon, UK; New York, N.Y. | year = 2013 | isbn = 9780415578295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Mosuo]] (a tiny society in the Yunnan Province in China), however, women exert greater power, authority, and control over decision-making.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Other societies are [[matrilinear]] or [[matrilocal]], primarily among indigenous tribal groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schlegel|first=Alice|title=Male dominance and female autonomy: domestic authority in matrilineal societies|date=1972|publisher=HRAF Press|location=New Haven, Connecticut|isbn =9780875363288}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[hunter-gatherer]] groups have been characterized as largely [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="erdal"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Erdal | first1 = David | last2 = Whiten | first2 = Andrew | chapter = Egalitarianism and Machiavellian intelligence in human evolution | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-okQAQAAIAAJ | editor-last1 = Mellars | editor-first1 = Paul | editor-last2 = Gibson | editor-first2 = Kathleen Rita | title = Modelling the early human mind | publisher = McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, University of Cambridge | location = Cambridge Oakville, Connecticut | series = Cambridge McDonald Monograph Series | date = 1996 | isbn = 9780951942017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some anthropologists, such as Ciccodicola, have argued that patriarchy is a [[cultural universal]].&lt;ref name="Ciccodicola2012"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ciccodicola | first = Floriana | title = Practicing anthropology in development processes: new perspectives for a radical anthropology | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Gq9QSx4CQLAC&amp;pg=PA160 | page = 160 | publisher = Edizioni Nuova Cultura | location = Roma | date = 2012 | isbn = 9788861347915 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Barbara Smuts argues that patriarchy evolved in humans through conflict between the reproductive interests of males and the reproductive interests of females. She lists six ways that it emerged:
# a reduction in female allies
# elaboration of male-male alliances
# increased male control over resources
# increased hierarchy formation among men
# female strategies that reinforce male control over females
# the evolution of language and its power to create ideology.&lt;ref&gt;Smuts, Barbara. "The Evolutionary Origins of Patriarchy."  Human Nature, Vol. 6, No. 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychoanalytic theories==
While the term ''patriarchy'' often refers to male domination generally, another interpretation sees it as literally "rule of the father".&lt;ref name="Mitchell_409"&gt;{{cite book | last = Mitchell | first = Juliet | author-link = Juliet Mitchell | chapter = The cultural revolution | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DwG0AAAAIAAJ | title = Psychoanalysis and feminism | page = 409 | publisher = Pantheon Books | location = New York | date = 1974 | isbn = 9780394474724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So some people{{Who|date=September 2018}} believe patriarchy does not refer simply to of male power over women, but the expression of power dependent on age as well as gender, such as by older men over women, children, and younger men. Some of these younger men may inherit and therefore have a stake in continuing these conventions. Others may rebel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Eherenreich | first = Barbara | chapter = Life without father | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=4_zeRtk81pcC | editor-last1 = McDowell | editor-first1 = Linda | editor-last2 = Pringle | editor-first2 = Rosemary | title = Defining women: Social institutions and gender divisions | publisher = Polity/Open University | location = London | date = 1992 | isbn = 9780745609799 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Cockburn | first = Cynthia | title = Brothers: male dominance and technological change | publisher = Pluto | location = London Concord, Massachusetts | date = 1991 | isbn = 9780745305837 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Explain|date=September 2018}}

This psychoanalytic model is based upon revisions of Freud's description of the normally neurotic family using the analogy of the story of [[Oedipus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Lacan | first = Jaques | author-link = Jaques Lacan | chapter = The mirror stage as formative of the function of the I as revealed in psychoanalytic experience (1949) | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XFtrNAEACAAJ |editor-last= Sheridan |editor-first= Alan |title= Écrits: a selection | publisher= Routledge |location= London |date=2001 |origyear= 1977 |isbn= 9780415253925 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Mulvey | first = Laura | author-link = Laura Mulvey | chapter = The Oedipus myth: beyond the riddles of the Sphinx | chapterurl = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=P6awCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 | title = Visual and other pleasures | pages = 177&amp;ndash;200 | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | location = Houndmills, Basingstoke, Hampshire England New York | date = 2009 | edition=   2nd | isbn = 9780230576469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who fall outside the Oedipal triad of mother/father/child are less subject to male authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Butler | first = Judith | author-link = Judith Butler | title = Antigone's claim: kinship between life and death | publisher = Columbia University Press | location = New York | date = 2000 | isbn = 9780231118958 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The operations of power in such cases are usually enacted unconsciously. All are subject, even fathers are bound by its strictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Dalton|first=Penelope| author-link = Pen Dalton|date=2008| chapter=Complex family relations|title=Family and other relations: a thesis examining the extent to which family relationships shape the relations of art|chapterurl =http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/758|publisher=[[University of Plymouth]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is represented in unspoken traditions and conventions performed in everyday behaviors, customs, and habits.&lt;ref name="Mitchell_409" /&gt; The triangular relationship of a father, a mother and an inheriting eldest son frequently form the dynamic and emotional narratives of popular culture and are enacted [[Performativity|performatively]] in rituals of courtship and marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Dalton | first = Pen | author-link = Pen Dalton| chapter = Theoretical perspectives | chapterurl = https://www.mheducation.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335196489.pdf | title = The gendering of art education: modernism, identity, and critical feminism | pages = 9&amp;ndash;32 | publisher = Open University | location = Buckingham England Philadelphia, Pennsylvania | date = 2001 | isbn = 9780335196494 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They provide conceptual models for organising power relations in spheres that have nothing to do with the family, for example, politics and business.&lt;ref&gt;''Citations'':

Arguing from this standpoint, radical feminist [[Shulamith Firestone]] wrote in her 1970 ''[[The Dialectic of Sex]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Marx was on to something more profound than he knew when he observed that the family contained within itself in embryo all the antagonisms that later develop on a wide scale within the society and the state. For unless revolution uproots the basic social organisation, the biological family – the vinculum through which the psychology of power can always be smuggled – the tapeworm of exploitation will never be annihilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Firestone |first=Shulamith | author-link = Shulamith Firestone | title = The dialectic of sex: the case for feminist revolution | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Zxy2AAAAIAAJ | publisher = Quill | location = New York | date = 1970 | isbn = 9780688123598 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Princess''''' (stylized as '''''Prince$$''''') is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] television series hosted by [[Gail Vaz-Oxlade]] that premiered in 2010, and ran original programming until 2012 (three seasons). The program is similar in format to her earlier endeavor, ''[[Til Debt Do Us Part]]''; however, rather than helping couples in financial trouble, Vaz-Oxlade assists women who are considered self-indulgent and spoiled.&lt;ref name=Globe&gt;{{cite news |title=Gail Vaz-Oxlade: The accidental guru |author=Sarah Hampson |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/family-and-relationships/gail-vaz-oxlade-the-accidental-guru/article1424785/ |newspaper= The Globe and Mail |date= 2010-01-30 |accessdate=2010-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants are given weekly challenges, some of which are to help bring the finances and debt under control, while others are meant to help correct the participant's attitude and make amends to their friends and relatives. At the end of six weeks, Vaz-Oxlade gives the participant a cheque for an amount up to $5,000, based upon Vaz-Oxlade's assessment of the participant's success in each of the challenges.

In the United States, the show airs as reruns on the cable channel [[Ion Life]].

'''Site Reliability Engineering''' ('''SRE''') is a discipline that incorporates aspects of [[software engineering]] and applies them to [[information technology operations|IT operations]] problems. The main goals are to create ultra-[[scalable]] and [[high availability|highly reliable]] software systems. According to Ben Treynor, founder of [[Google]]'s Site Reliability Team, SRE is "what happens when a software engineer is tasked with what used to be called operations."&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/02/are-site-reliability-engineers-the-next-data-scientists Are SRE the next data scientists?], [[TechCrunch]], Mar 2, 2016, Donald Fischer&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Site Reliability Engineering was created at Google around 2003 when Ben Treynor was hired to lead a team of seven [[software engineer]]s to run a production environment. The team was tasked to make Google's sites run smoothly, efficiently, and more reliably. Early on, Google's large-scale systems required the company to come up with new paradigms on how to manage such large systems and at the same time introduce new features continuously but at a very high-quality end user experience. The SRE footprint at Google is now larger than 1500 engineers. Many products have small to medium sized SRE teams supporting them, though not all products have SREs. The SRE processes that have been honed over the years are being used by other, mainly large scale, companies that are also starting to implement this paradigm. [[ServiceNow]], [[Microsoft]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Target.com|Target]], [[Dell Technologies]], [[IBM]], [[Xero (software)|Xero]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Zalando]], [[Acquia]], [[VMware]], [[GitHub]] and [[Waze]] have all put together SRE teams.

== Roles ==
A site reliability engineer (SRE) will spend up to 50% of their time doing "ops" related work such as issues, on-call, and manual intervention. Since the [[software]] system that an SRE oversees is expected to be highly automatic and self-healing, the SRE should spend the other 50% of their time on development tasks such as new features, scaling or automation. The ideal SRE candidate is a highly skilled system administrator with knowledge of code and automation.

=== DevOps vs SRE ===
{{Main|DevOps}}
Coined around 2008, DevOps is a philosophy of cross team empathy and business alignment.  It's also been associated with a practice that encompasses automation of manual tasks, [[continuous integration]] and [[continuous delivery]].  SRE and DevOps share the same foundational principles. SRE is viewed by many (as cited in the Google SRE book) as a "specific implementation of DevOps with some [[idiosyncratic]] extensions."  SREs, being developers themselves, will naturally bring solutions that help remove the barriers between development teams and operations teams.

DevOps defines 5 key pillars of success:

# Reduce organizational silos
# Accept failure as normal
# Implement gradual changes
# Leverage tooling and automation
# Measure everything

SRE satisfies the DevOps pillars as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTEL8Ff1Zvk|title=What's the Difference Between DevOps and SRE? (class SRE implements DevOps)|first=|last=Google Cloud Platform|date=1 March 2018|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3447">'''Spatial econometrics''' is the field where [[spatial analysis]] and [[econometrics]] intersect. The term “spatial econometrics” was introduced for the first time by the Belgian economist Jean Paelinck (universally recognised as the father of the discipline) in the general address he delivered to the annual meeting of the Dutch Statistical Association in May 1974 (Paelinck and Klaassen, 1979).
In general, econometrics differs from other branches of statistics in focusing on theoretical models, whose parameters are estimated using [[regression analysis]]. Spatial econometrics is a refinement of this, where either the theoretical model involves interactions between different entities, or the data observations are not truly independent. Thus, models incorporating [[spatial auto-correlation]] or [[neighborhood effects]] can be estimated using spatial econometric methods. Such models are common in [[regional science]], [[real estate economics]], [[education economics]], [[housing market]] and many others. Adopting a more general view, in the by-law of the [[Spatial Econometrics Association]], the discipline is defined as the set of “models and theoretical instruments of spatial statistics and spatial data analysis to analyse various economic effects such as externalities, interactions, spatial concentration and many others” (Spatial Econometrics Association, 2006). Recent developments tend to include also methods and models from [[social network]] econometrics.

==History==
The first general text in the field was the 1979 book by Paelinck and Klaasen.

'''''The Third Culture: Beyond the Scientific Revolution''''' is a 1995 book by [[John Brockman (literary agent)|John Brockman]] which discusses the work of several well-known scientists who are directly communicating their new, sometimes provocative, ideas to the general public. John Brockman has continued the themes of 'The Third Culture' in the website of the [[Edge Foundation, Inc.|Edge Foundation]], where leading scientists and thinkers contribute their thoughts in plain English.

The title of the book refers to [[Charles Percy Snow]]'s 1959 work ''[[The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution]]'', which described the conflict between the cultures of the [[humanities]] and [[science]].

== Contents ==
23 people were included in the 1995 book:
* physicist [[Paul Davies]]
* biologist [[Richard Dawkins]] 
* philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]]
* paleontologist [[Niles Eldredge]]
* chaos theorist [[J. Doyne Farmer]]
* theoretical physicist [[Murray Gell-Mann]]
* biologist [[Brian Goodwin]]
* geologist/biologist [[Stephen Jay Gould]]
* physicist [[Alan Guth]]
* inventor [[W. Daniel Hillis]]
* theoretical psychologist [[Nicholas Humphrey]]
* geneticist [[Steve Jones (biologist)|Steve Jones]]
* biologist [[Stuart Kauffman]]
* complex systems specialist [[Christopher Langton]]
* biologist [[Lynn Margulis]]
* mathematician and computer scientist [[Marvin Minsky]]
* mathematical physicist [[Roger Penrose]]
* cognitive scientist [[Steven Pinker]]
* theoretical astrophysicist [[Martin Rees]]
* cognitive scientist [[Roger Schank]]
* theoretical physicist [[Lee Smolin]]
* biologist [[Francisco Varela]]
* evolutionary biologist [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]]

The book influenced the reception of popular scientific literature in parts of the world beyond the United States. In Germany, the book inspired several newspapers to integrate scientific reports into their "[[Feuilleton]]" or "culture" sections (such as the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]''). At the same time, the assertions of the book were discussed as a source of controversy, especially the implicit assertion that "third culture thinking" is mainly an American development. Critics acknowledge that, whereas in the Anglo-Saxon cultures there is a large tradition of scientists writing popular books, such tradition was absent for a long period in the German and French languages, with journalists often filling the gap. However, some decades ago there were also scientists, like the physicists [[Werner Heisenberg|Heisenberg]] and [[Schrödinger]] and the psychologist [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]], who fulfill the criteria Brockman named for "third culture." The German author [[Gabor Paal]] suggested that the idea of the "third culture" is a rather modern version of what [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] called [[Realphilosophie]] (''philosophy of the real'').

Also, already during the [[interwar period]], [[Otto Neurath]] and other members of the [[Vienna Circle]] strongly propagated the need for both the [[unity of science]] and the popularization of new scientific concepts. With the rise of the Nazis in Germany and Austria, many of the Vienna Circle's members left for the United States where they taught in several universities, causing their philosophical ideas to spread in the Anglo-Saxon world throughout the 1930s-1940s.

'''Transport finance''' is the subject that explores how [[transport]] networks are paid for.    

The timing of the money required to finance transport is a principal issue.  Many projects are "[[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]]", that is infrastructure, which lasts many years, is expected to be paid out of ongoing cash flow.  Other projects are financed with [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] raised in [[capital market]]s. Bonds must be secured with an expected future cash flow.  

The cash flow, required for either pay-as-you-go or for bonds, must be raised.  Common sources are [[user fee]]s, such as [[gas tax]]es, and [[Toll road|toll]]s.  Other sources are [[revenue|general revenue]].  This issue is related to who bears the burden: users or the general public.  Even if users bear the burden, that class must be subdivided, e.g. users during peak times or off-peak, freight or passenger traffic, urban or rural users, residents or non-residents (many toll plazas are located on the state line to maximize revenue from non-residents).

A third issue concerns the [[full cost]]s of transportation.  There are monetary costs, which are financed with money, as considered above, but there are also non-monetary costs (sometimes called [[hidden cost]]s), which are paid for by people's time, by clean air, by peace and quiet, etc.  See the discussion of [[externalities]] for a fuller explication of non-monetary costs.

== History ==
Plans for the creation of this public university were first developed at the 1849 [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], but when the State of [[California]] was established in 1850, it lacked the funds necessary to create such a school. Missionaries sent west by the [[American Home Missionary Society|Home Mission Society]] of New York, however, created the [[College of California]] and eventually transferred its ownership to the State in 1855.

By 1862, the State had secured the land necessary to establish a college as a result of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|Morrill Act.]] This college was known as the Agricultural Mining and Mechanical Arts College, and opened formally in 1866.

On March 23, 1868, [[Henry Huntly Haight|Governor H.H.

== Campus ==
[[File:Cnr map.png|thumb|The original College of Agriculture consisted of the Hilgard, Wellman, and Giannini halls. Today, CNR has expanded to occupy the Koshland, Morgan, and Mulford buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nature.berkeley.edu/site/forms/pdf/CNR_Report.pdf|title=College of Natural Resources|last=|first=|date=February 2016|website=Forms &amp; Petitions|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The College of Natural Resources is located on the northwest end of the UC Berkeley campus, and comprises six main buildings.

These include the historic group of Wellman, Hilgard, and Giannini halls that composed the original college. This trio, known as the Agriculture Complex, is the most unified grouping of buildings on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riggs|first=William|last2=Knapp|first2=Frederic|date=2012-01-01|title=Hilgard Hall (John Galen Howard) Historic Structures Report|url=https://works.bepress.com/williamriggs/15/}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], and are visually unified by a Mediterranean landscape of olive and stone pine trees.

The first hall, Wellman, is a Classical Revival building designed in 1912 by [[John Galen Howard]] and named after [[Harry R. Wellman]], a professor of Agricultural Economics, and acting president of the University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb7t1nb4v2&amp;doc.view=frames&amp;chunk.id=div00071&amp;toc.id=|title=University of California: In Memoriam, 1997|website=texts.cdlib.org|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hilgard was constructed six years later by the same architect, and named after [[Eugene W. Hilgard]], professor of Agricultural Chemistry and father of modern soil science. Its neo-classical design is inscribed with the phrase "''To Rescue for Human Society the Native Values of Rural Life''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://noehill.com/alameda/nat1982004647.asp|title=National Register #82004647: Hilgard Hall on UC Berkeley Campus, California|website=noehill.com|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giannini Hall was designed by Howard's co-worker, William Charles Hays, through an endowment from the Bancitaly Corporation (now known as [[Bank of America]]) in memory of their founder, [[Amadeo Giannini]].

Glass, painted and stained. 11 ft. 10 1/4 in. x 5 ft. 7 in. [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].]]'''Valentin Bousch''' (circa 1490 &amp;ndash; August 1541) was a [[Renaissance]] [[stained glass]] [[glazier]] and [[painting|painter]] from [[Strasbourg]], active in the [[Duchy of Lorraine]] and the Republic of [[Metz]]. A rarity among stained glass artists, Bousch is seen as one who actively sought to express new ideas in his art, often before they were widely used in the area, revising his method even from one window to the next,&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (pp. 178-179)&lt;/ref&gt; to create striking Renaissance effects and a personal style.&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (pp. 169–82)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Bousch was born in Strasbourg. The earliest mention of his work is at [[Saint-Nicolas-de-Port]], near [[Nancy, France|Nancy]] in 1514.&lt;ref&gt;Isler-de Jongh, 1998 (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt; Bousch was active there from 1514 to 1520, developed a large glass studio and made many windows for the Saint Nicolas basilica. In 1518 he also made windows for the priory church of [[Varangéville]]&lt;ref&gt;These stained glasses disappeared during the First World War&lt;/ref&gt; on a command of the Bishop of Metz, [[Jean, Cardinal of Lorraine|John IV of Lorraine]]. On 25 September 1518, Valentin Bousch became the master glazier of the [[Metz Cathedral|cathedral of Metz]], where most work was done in the years 1520-1528, and 1534-1539.&lt;ref&gt;Isler-de Jongh, 1998 (p. 3)&lt;/ref&gt; In between, he made a cycle of biblical scenes for the Saint-Firmin priory church in [[Flavigny-sur-Moselle]].&lt;ref name=metdeluge&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/193344? | accessdate = 2014-01-29 | title = The Metropolitan Museum of Art - The Deluge}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of documents relating to Bousch, including his will&lt;!--i'M NOT SURE IT'S THERE--&gt; are at the [[Bibliothèque municipale de Nancy]].&lt;ref&gt;Isler-de Jongh, 1998 (p. 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

Examples of his skills are still in place in the Saint-Nicolas-de-Port Basilica, and the Metz Cathedral.  In addition, Bousch made several stained glass windows commissioned by the bourgeoisie of Metz for churches, hotels and chapels in the Lorraine countryside. A work attributed to his pupil, from 1548, is in the church of Saint Marcel, [[Ennery, Moselle]].&lt;ref name=mennery&gt;{{Cite web| publisher = Mairie d'Ennery | title = L'Eglise Saint Marcel | accessdate = 2014-03-24

===Saint-Nicolas-de-Port===
In Saint-Nicolas-de-Port, much of the glass had not survived the [[Thirty Years' War]] and later events, and other parts are rearranged. Yet Bousch is attributed with the great [[rose window]], and some windows, in full or part, in the small chapels. The repetitions, as well as some uncertain attributions, are explained by the fact that works were mostly commissioned by donors, and were no part of an overall design of the church.&lt;ref name=lesvit&gt;{{Cite web| publisher = Association Connaissance et Renaissance de la Basilique de Saint-Nicolas-de-Port| title = Les vitraux| accessdate = 2014-02-05| language = French | url = http://saintnicolaslorraine.sharepoint.com/Pages/Lesvitraux.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Chapelle Notre Dame des Victoires: [[Dormition of the Mother of God|The Dormition of Mary]], her funeral and her [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]; and in another window, the [[Presentation of Mary]], the [[Visitation (Christianity)|Visitation]] and the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple]].&lt;ref name=plaquedeport&gt;{{cite sign | author = Association Connaissance et Renaissance de la Basilique de Saint-Nicolas-de-Port | title = Plan Général de Visite | type = floor plan with notes |  url = http://dignois.fr/Saint-Nicolas-Port/target30.html | publisher = dignois.fr}}. Note images 31-33 of [http://dignois.fr/Saint-Nicolas-Port/ the gallery] zoom on the text.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Chapelle Saint Anne: possibly a window with the [[Annunciation]] and [[Saint Barbara]], and another with church donors, coats of arms and [[Adrian of Nicomedia]].&lt;ref name = lesvit /&gt; In the Chapelle des saints archanges Michel, Raphaël et Gabriel – only parts. In the Chapelle Saint Vincent et Saint Fiacre, two renditions of [[Saint George and the Dragon]], a mounted [[Martin of Tours]] giving his cloak, and a [[Catherine of Alexandria]], in windows shared with other artists.&lt;ref name=laterales&gt;{{Cite web | title = Vitraux des chapelles latérales | accessdate = 2014-02-09 | language = French | publisher = La Paroisse Saint Nicolas en Lorraine | url = http://paroisse.stnicolas.free.fr/vitraux-des-chapelles-laterales.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two greater windows, are dedicated one to [[Saint Sebastian]] and other characters, the other mostly to the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]], witnessed by a circle with [[Moses]], [[Elijah]], [[Saint Peter]] and others.&lt;ref name=grandes&gt;{{Cite web| title = LES GRANDES FENÊTRES| url = http://paroisse.stnicolas.free.fr/les-grandes-fentres.html| language = French| accessdate = 2014-02-24| publisher = La Paroisse Saint Nicolas en Lorraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flavigny-sur-Moselle===
The windows from Flavigny-sur-Moselle show Bousch's mature style. Out of a cycle of seven, three were lost by 1850, and four were sold in 1904 by the priory and are dispersed in North America. Two are in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (along with four smaller pieces), one in St. Joseph church, [[Stockbridge, Massachusetts]] and one in a private collection in Canada.&lt;ref name=metdeluge /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Isler-de Jongh, 1998 (pp. 1,9)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
As a glazier, Bousch produced large cuts of glass that were technically difficult to make,&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (pp. 169-170)&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed greater freedom in painting.&lt;ref&gt;However, mending lead that has been added over breakages, is not always distinguished from the original installations. See Bugslag, 1998 (p. 170)&lt;/ref&gt; Bousch's glasses were designed to keep each window's net of lead reinforcement lines along the picture's painted contours, so they will not interrupt the scene.&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (pp. 170-171)&lt;/ref&gt; At times, obvious lead lines were incorporated to emphasize an object,&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (p. 173)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (p. 176)&lt;/ref&gt; The more traditional method of placing lead lines in a way that help define panels,&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (p. 170)&lt;/ref&gt; or spotlight a person's head,&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (p.  171)&lt;/ref&gt; was used as a second choice in Bousch's work.

As a painter, Bousch utilized the large glass cuts to present rich arrays of shadows and background details, applying [[Grisaille]] color [[wash (painting)|washes]] in modulation.&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (p. 171)&lt;/ref&gt; The luminosity and color of his support medium came into play, as he left the brightest areas in the painting, the least matted surfaces in a glass.&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (p. 172)&lt;/ref&gt; Illusionistic details were added to distract a viewer away from lead lines.&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (p. 173)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
Bousch drew ideas from a number of artistic schools and media, and adapted them to glass painting, which resulted in defying some late [[gothic art|gothic]] characteristics and traditional techniques of the stained glass field. Identified early influences were [[Rhenish]] or [[German Renaissance]] artists. Some elements from [[Hans Baldung Grien]],&lt;ref&gt;Isler-de Jongh, 1998 (p. 8)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albrecht Dürer]], but also [[Matthias Grünewald ]]'s [[Isenheim Altarpiece]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|the elder Cranach]]'s 1503 ''Crucifixion'', have been paired each with a parallel detail from Bousch. He most likely studied their works from [[Printmaking|prints]], but probably also knew Baldung Grien, a citizen of Strasbourg, in person. Bousch had his own experience in [[panel painting]].

In Bousch's later work, particularly the windows of Flavigny-sur-Moselle, in addition to using these artists' works as models, Bousch introduced many novelties. Gothic decorations like foliage and [[damask]] backgrounds were minimized, replaced by neoclassical architectural frames;&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (pp. 175-176)&lt;/ref&gt; Generic glass panels gave way to Bousch's more advanced cutting and leading; [[Halo (religious iconography)|Halo]]s, to naturalistic light beams.&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (p. 176n)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Perspective (graphical)|Perspective]] was nuanced for different emotive ends, objects placed strategically in space and persons arranged in dramatic, purposeful postures,&lt;ref&gt;Bugslag, 1998 (p. 176)&lt;/ref&gt; some in daring nudity.&lt;ref&gt;Even when their biblical role had not required it. See Bugslag, 1998 (p. 177)&lt;/ref&gt; These are all signs of another layer of influences on Bousch work, that of [[Italian Renaissance]] and [[Mannerism]].&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps related to the [[Antwerp Mannerists]]. Bugslag, 1998 (p. 177)&lt;/ref&gt; However, no direct sources of this phase are known.

On a religious dimension, his Flavigny-sur-Moselle work has also been connected with a Catholic prior's relatively sympathetic response to [[protestant reformation|protestant]] humanist thought; the cycle is interpreted as identifying a history of [[predestination]] within the bible.&lt;ref&gt;Isler-de Jongh, 1998 (pp. 12–13)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Visigoths]] entered [[Hispania]] (modern [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]) in 415, and they rose to be the dominant people there until the [[Moors|Moorish]] invasion of 711 brought their kingdom to an end.

This period in [[Iberian peninsula|Iberian]] art is dominated by their style. '''Visigothic art''' is generally considered in the [[English language|English]]-speaking world to be a strain of [[Migration art]], while the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking worlds generally classify it as [[Pre-Romanesque]].

Branches of Visigothic art include their [[architecture]], their crafts (especially jewellery), and even their [[Visigothic script|script]].

==Visigothic architecture==

The only remaining examples of their architecture from the 6th century are the church of [[San Cugat del Vallés]] in [[Barcelona]], the hermitage and church of [[Santa Maria de Lara]] in Burgos, [[Saint Frutuoso Chapel]] in ([[Braga]]), the [[Igreja de São Gião|church of São Gião]] in ([[Nazaré (Portugal)|Nazaré]]) and the few remnants of the church at [[Cabeza de Griego]], [[Province of Cuenca|Cuenca]]. However, their style developed over the next centuries, though the prime remaining examples of it are mostly rural and often run-down. Some of the characteristics of their architecture are:
* Generally [[basilica]]n in layout, sometimes a [[Greek cross]] plan or, more rarely, a combination of the two. The spaces are highly compartmentalised.
* Horseshoe [[arch]]es without [[Keystone (architecture)|keystones]].
* A rectangular, exterior [[apse]].
* Use of [[column]]s and pillars with Corinthian [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of unique design.
* [[Barrel vault]]s with [[cupola]]s at the crosses.
* Walls of [[ashlar]] blocks, occasionally alternating with Roman brickwork.
* Decoration commonly of animal or plant motifs.

'''Zerovalent iron''' and other [[valence (chemistry)#Common valences|zerovalent]] metals (ZVI and ZVM, respectively) have a variety of applications ranging from [[filtration|filters]] to [[electrode]]s to [[trench]]es. One of the emerging uses for ZVI is iron wall [[Groundwater remediation|remediation]]. This technology uses ZVIs to form a [[permeable reactive barrier]] (PRB) which filters out contaminants in [[groundwater]], leaving only decontaminated groundwater and dissolved iron on the other side of the PRB.{{TOC left}}

==History==
The development of granular iron PRB technology was reliant on two advances: that metallic irons breaks down chlorinated organic compounds, and that reactions can proceed ''in situ'' under normal [[groundwater]] conditions.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"&gt;Gillham, Robert, John Vogan, Lai Gui, Michael Duchene, and Jennifer Son. "Iron Barrier Walls for Chlorinated Solvent Remediation." &lt;ins&gt;''In Situ'' Remediation of Chlorinated Solvent Plumes&lt;/ins&gt;. Ed. Hans F. Stroo and C. Herb Ward. New York, NY: Springer Science+Business Media, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Metals have been used as [[catalyst]]s since the 20th century, with more literature available concerning the corrosion of metal shipping and storage containers.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt; Because this literature concerned pure solvents rather than [[aqueous]] solutions and the processes often occurred at high temperatures and pressures, it was not looked at by the environmental community.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt; In 1972, zerovalent metals were found to be effective in breaking down pesticides and other chlorinated organic compounds in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=Reynolds&gt;Reynolds GW, Hoff JT, Gillham R W. 1990. Sampling bias caused by materials used to monitor halocarbons in groundwater. Environ Sci Technol 24:135--142&lt;/ref&gt; However, this finding was also overlooked, perhaps because it was only recorded in patents and it preceded awareness of chlorinated solvents in groundwater as an environmental problem.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt;

In the 1980s, a student at the [[University of Waterloo]] examined the possibility of sample bias caused by [[sorption]] of contaminants to well casings and other materials used in groundwater sampling.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt; While contaminants were lost from solution as a result of [[diffusion]] into [[polymer]]s, contaminant losses were also observed when solutions came into contact with certain metals, and these losses were not consistent with a [[diffusion]] process.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt; [[redox|Reductive]] dechlorination was considered the most likely cause.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; This was confirmed by tests that showed several [[transitional metals]] had the ability to degrade many chlorinated [[aliphatic compound]]s.&lt;ref name="Gillham 537"/&gt;

==Background (theory)==
===Basic chemistry of iron corrosion===
The [[rust|corrosion]] reaction involving water is slow, whereas the corrosion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; with dissolved oxygen is fast, presuming there is O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; present. These are the reactive processes:
&lt;br /&gt;
[[:wikt:anaerobic|Anaerobic]] corrosion: Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Oxygen|Aerobic]] corrosion: 2Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 4OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The presence of a reducible contaminant can produce another reaction which can then contribute to the overall corrosion rate.&lt;ref name=Tratnyek2 /&gt;

===Pathways for contaminant reduction===

The zerovalent metal (usually granular iron) is the bulk reducing agent in these systems. However, corrosion of iron metal yields Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and hydrogen, both of which are possible reducing agents for contaminants such as chlorinated solvents. A [[heuristic]] model consisting of three possible mechanisms has proven very useful.

Pathway A represents direct electron transfer (ET) for Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to the adsorbed halocarbon (RX) at the metal/water point of contact, resulting in dechlorination and production of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Pathway B shows that Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (resulting from corrosion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;) may also dechlorinate RX, producing Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;. Pathway C shows that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the [[:wikt:anaerobic|anaerobic]] corrosion of Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; might react with RX if a catalyst is present.

[[Hydrogenation]] also plays a minor role in most systems and iron surfaces will be covered with precipitates of oxides (or carbonates and sulfides) under most environmental conditions. Concern stemming from how the oxide layer mediates transfer of electrons from Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to adsorbed RX led to the formulation of another heuristic model, again consisting of three mechanisms.

In the second model, pathway I shows essentially direct ET from Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to RX in a corrosion pit, or similar defect in the oxide film. Pathway II shows the oxide film mediating ET from Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; to RX by acting as a semiconductor. Pathway III shows the oxide film as a coordinating surface containing sites of Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; that complex and reduce RX.&lt;ref name=Tratnyek&gt;Tratnyek, Paul, and Rick Johnson. "Remediation with Iron Metal." Center for Groundwater Research. Oregon Health and Science University, 04 Feb. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sequestration====
Sequestration of a contaminant refers to a removal process which does not involve contaminant degradation. Sequestration by Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; typically occurs via [[adsorption]], [[redox|reduction]], and [[coprecipitation]]. Often, adsorption is only a prelude to other processes which do transform the contaminant in order to assure that the process cannot be reversed. However, there are cases where adsorption is the sequestration process of primary importance, especially with metals that occur as soluble [[cation]]s which cannot be reduced to insoluble forms by Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. It also can be true in heavy metals, such as [[cadmium|Cd]], [[copper|Cu]], [[mercury (element)|Hg]], etc., which exist predominantly as soluble cations but could be reduced to insoluble species by Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Tratnyek2&gt;Tratnyek, P. G.; M. M. Scherer; T. J. Johnson; Matheson, L.J. (2003). Permeable reactive barriers of iron and other zerovalent metals. In: Tarr M. A. (ed.), Chemical Degradation Methods for Wastes and Pollutants; Environmental and Industrial Applications. Environmental Science and Pollution Control, Marcel Dekker, New York, pp 371-421. {{doi|10.1201/9780203912553.ch9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type of Metal==
===Iron===
[[Cast iron]], consisting of scrap iron of construction grade, has been used as a reactive material for [[permeable reactive barrier]]s for [[groundwater remediation]]. Reactions are generally believed to occur on the Fe (oxide) surface; however, graphite inclusions have been shown can also serve as a reaction site for [[2,4-Dinitrotoluene]] (DNT)&lt;ref name=Jafarpour&gt;Jafarpour, B.; Imhoff, P. T.; Chiu. P.C. 2005. Quantification and modeling of 2,4-dinitrotoluene reduction with high-purity and cast iron. Journal of Contaminant Hydrology. 76(1-2): 87-107. {{doi|10.1016/j.jconhyd.2004.08.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

High purity iron is another category that indicates commercial, granular iron for [[powder metallurgy]], etc.

===Zinc and other metals===
Zinc has showed much higher reactivity toward [[pentachlorophenol]] than iron. This indicates that zinc may be used as a replacement for ZVI in dechlorinating chlorinated phenols. Chlorinated phenols are sequentially dechlorinated and thus less chlorinated phenols have been identified as a reduction product.&lt;ref name=Kim&gt;Kim, Y. H.; Carraway, E. R. 2003. Dechlorination of chlorinated phenols by zerovalent zinc. Environmental Technology. 24(12): 1455-1463. {{doi|10.1080/09593330309385690}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bimetallic combinations===
[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) are decontaminated using a treatment system including catalytic ZVM particles and an organic hydrogen donating solvent. The solvent includes water and an [[alcohol]]. The treatment system can contain a 2nd solvent, such as [[d-limonene]], [[toluene]], or [[hexane]]. The treatment system can contain a thickener, such as [[calcium stearate]] or [[starch]]. The treatment system can contain a stabilizer, such as [[glycerin]], [[mineral oil]], or [[vegetable oil]]. The catalyst consists of zerovalent metal particles, esp. [[magnesium]] or [[iron]], coated with a catalytic metal, such as [[palladium]], [[nickel]], or [[silver]]. The treatment system provides a paste-like system that is preferably applied to natural media and ex-situ structures.&lt;ref name=Quinn&gt;Quinn, J. W., K. B. Brooks, C. L. Geiger, and C. A. Clausen. 2007. Bimetallic treatment system and its application for removal and remediation of polychlorinated biphenyls. WO. Patent No. 2007021640. United States of America as Represented by the Adm, 20060807.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanoscale particles===
[[File:Iron Wall Types.png|thumb|205 px|click to enlarge]]
In addition to using "typical" scale iron in [[permeable reactive barrier|PRBs]], [[nanoparticles]] (1-100&amp;nbsp;nm diameter)  containing zerovalent iron (nZVI) may be used. There are uncertainties regarding the features of this technology which have made it difficult to engineer applications for optimal performance or to assess the risk to human or ecological health. However, several key facts have been identified related to nZVIs which, if ignored, may lead to misconceptions of the technology. These are as follows: 1) nZVIs used in [[groundwater remediation]] are larger than particles that exhibit "true" [[Nanoparticle#Properties|nano-size effects]] 2) the high reactivity of nZVI is mainly due to its high [[specific surface area]] and 3) the mobility of the nZVI particles will, in almost all relevant scenarios, be less than a few meters (one implication of this limited mobility is that human exposure due to [[groundwater remediation|remediation]] applications of nZVI is likely to be minimal). However, there are still many characteristics of this technology about which very little is known: e.g., how quickly nZVI will be transformed and to what products, whether this residue will be detectable in the environment, and how surface modifications of nZVI will alter its long-term environmental fate and effectiveness for remediation.&lt;ref name=Tratnyek/&gt;

The top-down approach for manufacturing [[nanoparticle|nano]]-ZVMs starts with a large metal particle (granular or microscale) and breaks it down. To do this, either mechanical or chemical means may be used which include but are not limited to milling, etching, and machining. On the other hand, the bottom up approach involves "growing" [[nanoparticle]]s via chemical synthesis, self-assembling, positional assembling, etc.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;Li, X.; Elliot, D. W.; Zhang, W. 2006. Zerovalent iron nanoparticles for abatement of environmental pollutants: materials and engineering aspects. Critical Reviews in Solid State and Materials Sciences. 31(4): 111-122. {{doi|10.1080/10408430601057611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Type of contaminants treated==
===Metals===
[[Chromate]] is a significant component of many radioactive contaminant plumes. One removal technique involves the addition of scrap metal iron. The reactive surface of ZVI in [[alkaline]] waters is a [[ferrous]] coating such as green rust.&lt;ref name=Wander&gt;Wander, M. C. F.; Rosso, K.M.; Schoonen, M.A. 2006. Reduction of chromate by ferrous iron and green rust: A comparison of homogeneous vs. heterogeneous electron transfer rates. 232nd ACS National Meeting, San Francisco, CA. Abstracts of Papers, 232nd ACS National Meeting, COLL-509.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[arsenic]], when selecting the reactive material of the PRB, one must consider the properties of the contaminant. In the case of treating arsenic-contaminated water, materials with a high potential for [[anion]] [[adsorption]] and [[coprecipitation]] are desirable. It is also beneficial to have a high potential to reduce the contaminant to an insoluble solid. For the removal of arsenic, the following is the chemical process involved:&lt;ref&gt;'''''This still needs to be cited, comes from the laminate-cover booklet called "Advances in PRBs for Groundwater Treatment"'''''&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[Iron(III) chloride|FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[water|3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]] + [[Arsenic|[As]]] → [As][[Iron(III) hydroxide|Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + [[hydrogen ion|3H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] + [[chloride|Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]]

[[Technetium]], a radioactive material, is of great concern due to its long [[half-life]] and abundance in commercial nuclear waste. [[Technetium]] in lower valency states has a lower solubility and sorbs more strongly to soils than does [[technetium|Te]]&lt;sup&gt;7+&lt;/sup&gt;. ZVI has the potential to remove technetium in groundwater.&lt;ref name=Ding&gt;Ding, M.; Schroeder, N.C.; Reimus P.W. 2001. Zerovalent iron as a reducing "getter" for immobilization of technetium. 222nd ACS National Meeting, Chicago, IL. Abstracts of Papers, 222nd ACS National Meeting, Chicago, IL, United States, ENVR-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

To [[groundwater remediation|remediate]] groundwater contaminated by [[uranium]] a treatment has been developed to minimize the mobility of [[uranyl]] by transferring it to a stable phase. Because the exact mechanism of the decontamination process is unknown,  numerous forms of ZVI-materials have been synthesized, including carbon steel, low alloy steel, cast iron, and all other iron-containing alloys.&lt;ref name=Baghvand&gt;Baghvand, A. 2003. Immobilization of uranium in groundwater. Journal of Environmental Studies. 29(31): 1-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-metal inorganics ===
[[Chloramines]] pose a threat to aquatic ecosystems that are exposed to discharges of treated wastewater. Dechlorination with [[sulfite]] reduces the most refractory organic chloramines too slowly to produce wastewater effluents that meet current ecosystem protection criteria in the United States. The aqueous-phase reducing agents that offer speed advantages over sulfite alone include [[dithionite]], [[thiosulfate]], and iodide-mediated sulfite. Ascorbic acid was even more reactive but was found to be slow relative to sulfite. The potential biological oxygen demand might constrain the choice of aqueous reductants. Metallic iron is shown to reduce inorganic and organic chloramines effectively.&lt;ref name=Bedner&gt;Bedner, M.; W. A. MacCrehan; G. R. Helz. 2004. Making chlorine greener: investigation of alternatives to sulfite for dechlorination. Water Research. 38(10): 2505-2514. {{doi|10.1016/j.watres.2004.03.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rapid [[nitrate]] reduction by iron powder is observed only at [[pH]]≤4. [[pH]] control with sulfuric acid prolongs nitrate reduction and increases the amount removed.&lt;ref name=Huang&gt;Huang, C.; Wang, H.; Chiu, P. 1998. Nitrate reduction by metallic iron. Water Research. 32(8): 2257-2264. {{doi|10.1016/S0043-1354(97)00464-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ammonia is the end product of nitrate reduction and accounts for all nitrate transformed under certain experimental conditions.&lt;ref name=Huang/&gt; However, by using nanoscale iron N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas is the product instead.&lt;ref name=Choe&gt;Choe, S.; Chang, Y.; Hwang, K.; Khim, J. 1999. Kinetics of reductive denitrification by nanoscale zerovalent iron. Chemosphere. 41(8): 1307-1311. {{doi|10.1016/S0045-6535(99)00506-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ferrous]] species, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are probably not involved in the reaction.&lt;ref name=Huang/&gt;

===Organics===
Iron has been shown to be successful at dechlorinating pesticides such as [[DDT]], [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane|DDD]], and [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]]. The rates of dechlorination was independent of the amount of iron; however, the rates with a [[surfactant]] (Triton X-114) present were much higher. The rate of dechlorination is limited by the rate of dissolution into the aqueous phase.&lt;ref name="Sayles"&gt;Sayles, G. D.; You, G.; Wang, M.; Kupferle, M. J. 1997. DDT, DDD, and DDE dechlorination by zerovalent iron. Environmental Science &amp; Technology. 31(12): 3448-3454. {{doi|10.1021/es9701669}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Viruses]] are especially problematic in the environment because they are more mobile and more resistant to chlorination and filtration than are bacteria. Removal of viruses from groundwater involve several different forms of iron, including Fe&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;, Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, and [[magnetite]]. Additionally, viruses can interact with iron in different ways, and thus can be deactivated to different extents.&lt;ref name=Zhang&gt;Zhang, L.; Chiu, P. C.; Jin, Y. 2006. Remediation and inactivation of viruses with elemental iron. 231st ACS National Meeting, American Chemical Society, Division of Environment. Atlanta, GA. Abstracts of Papers, 231st ACS National Meeting, ENVR-234.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modes of application==
===Permeable reactive barriers===
{{Main|Permeable reactive barrier}}

===Soil mixing===
[[Permeable reactive barrier]]s can be less effective at greater depths due to construction matters, as most construction techniques involves excavation of the soil and replacing with reactive media. Soil mixing wall (SMW) technology, which is establishing cut-off walls and mixing cement slurries directly with soils under the ground, has become a new technology in soil remediation.&lt;ref name=Ito&gt;Ito, H., S. Hino, K. Okunishi, Y. Kinryu, and N. Hamamoto. 2004. Trial for constructing PRBS as application of soil mixing wall. International Conference on Remediation of Chlorinated and Recalcitrant Compounds, 4th, Monterey, CA. Proceedings of the International Conference on Remediation of Chlorinated and Recalcitrant Compounds, 4th, Monterey, CA, United States, May 24–27, 2004, 3A 04/1-3A 04/8.&lt;/ref&gt;
