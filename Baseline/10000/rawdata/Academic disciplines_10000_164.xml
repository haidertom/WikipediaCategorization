      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12584">[[Image:3dultrasound 20 weeks.jpg|thumb|A 3D ultrasound of a human fetus aged 20 weeks]]
'''3D ultrasound''' is a [[medical ultrasound]] technique, often used in fetal, cardiac, trans-rectal and intra-vascular applications. 3D ultrasound refers specifically to the volume rendering of ultrasound data and is also referred to as 4D (3-spatial dimensions plus 1-time dimension) when it involves a series of 3D volumes collected over time.

When generating a 3D volume the ultrasound data can be collected in 4 common ways. Freehand, which involves tilting the probe and capturing a series of ultrasound images and recording the transducer orientation for each slice. Mechanically, where the internal linear probe tilt is handled by a motor inside the probe. Using an endoprobe, which generates the volume by inserting a probe and then removing the transducer in a controlled manner. The fourth technology is the matrix array transducer that uses beamsteering to sample points throughout a pyramid shaped volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoskins|first1=Peter|last2=Martin|first2=Kevin|last3=Thrush|first3=Abigail|title=Diagnostic ultrasound : physics and equipment|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0-521-75710-2|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Risks ==

The [[Medical ultrasound#Risks and side-effects|general risks of ultrasound]] also apply to 3D Ultrasound. Essentially ultrasound is considered safe. While other imaging modalities use radioactive dye or ionizing radiation, for example, ultrasound transducers send pulses of high frequency sound into the body and then listen for the echo.

In summary, the primary risks associated with ultrasound would be the potential heating of tissue or [[cavitation]]. The mechanisms by which tissue heating and cavitation are measured are through the standards called thermal index (TI) and mechanical index (MI). Even though the FDA outlines very safe values for maximum TI and MI it is still recommended to avoid unnecessary ultrasound imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Health|first1=Center for Devices and Radiological|title=Medical Imaging  - Ultrasound Imaging|url=https://www.fda.gov/Radiation-EmittingProducts/RadiationEmittingProductsandProcedures/MedicalImaging/ucm115357.htm#benefitsrisks|website=www.fda.gov|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
=== Obstetrics ===
The progress of growing babies in the womb is difficult to examine as the fetuses are always in motion with rapid rate of heartbeat. So while scanning a womb, the patients need to keep their breath still so the real picture can be captured. With 3D US, the doctors can now detect the movement of fetuses in a flash of second and also take necessary step immediately. In addition to examining the position of the fetus, the problems and any abnormal behaviors in the womb can be detected like accumulation of fluid or any spine curvature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1148/radiology.211.2.r99mr02441 |pmid=10228526 |title=Fetal Abnormalities: Evaluation with Real-time-Processible Three-dimensional US—Preliminary Report |journal=Radiology |volume=211 |issue=2 |pages=441–446 |year=1999 |last1=Baba |first1=Kazunori |last2=Okai |first2=Takashi |last3=Kozuma |first3=Shiro |last4=Taketani |first4=Yuji }}&lt;/ref&gt; With 3D US and 3D surfacing the heartbeat of the fetus can also be traced enabling the doctor to outline the growth of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.acvd.2013.10.003 |pmid=24364911 |title=Real-time three-dimensional foetal echocardiography using a new transabdominal xMATRIX array transducer |journal=Archives of Cardiovascular Diseases |volume=107 |issue=1 |pages=4–9 |year=2014 |last1=Acar |first1=Philippe |last2=Battle |first2=Laia |last3=Dulac |first3=Yves |last4=Peyre |first4=Marianne |last5=Dubourdieu |first5=Hélène |last6=Hascoet |first6=Sébastien |last7=Groussolles |first7=Marion |last8=Vayssière |first8=Christophe }}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Cardiology ===
The application of three-dimension ultrasound in cardiac treatments has done outstanding progress in scanning and treating the heart  issues. When the 3D ultrasound technology is used to visualize the cardiac state of an individual, it is called as 3D Echocardiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1155/2017/6027029 |pmid=28459067 |pmc=5385255 |title=A Review on Real-Time 3D Ultrasound Imaging Technology |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2017 |pages=1–20 |year=2017 |last1=Huang |first1=Qinghua |last2=Zeng |first2=Zhaozheng }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the integration of other technologies with the Ultrasound, it is now possible to track the quantitative measures like the chamber volume that occurs during the cardiac cycle. Also, it provides other useful information like tracking the blood flow, speed of contractions and expansions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=26548305 |url=http://www.eurekaselect.com/136745/article |year=2016 |last1=Pedrosa |first1=J. |title=Cardiac Chamber Volumetric Assessment Using 3D Ultrasound - A Review |journal=Current Pharmaceutical Design |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=105–21 |last2=Barbosa |first2=D. |last3=Almeida |first3=N. |last4=Bernard |first4=O. |last5=Bosch |first5=J. |last6=d'Hooge |first6=J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the 3D Echocardiography method doctors now can easily detect the artery diseases and can finely examine the various defects. The echo applications helps to give a real-time image of the cardiac structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/eurheartj/eht350 |pmid=24126880 |title=Stress echo applications beyond coronary artery disease |journal=European Heart Journal |volume=35 |issue=16 |pages=1033–1040 |year=2013 |last1=Picano |first1=E. |last2=Pellikka |first2=P. A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Surgical Guidance ===
Traditionally, with the 2D US the specific position of organs and tissues useful in surgeries could not be located especially in the oblique plane. However, with the advent of 3D US, the imaging technique has evolved manifolds enabling the surgeons to get a real-time picture of the tissues and organs and visualize the complete scan more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1118/1.4956176 |title=SU-F-T-41: 3D MTP-TRUS for Prostate Implant |journal=Medical Physics |volume=43 |issue=6Part13 |pages=3470–3471 |year=2016 |last1=Yan |first1=P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, 3D US provides surgical guidance in terms of treating transplant and cancer with its technique of rotational visualizing while scanning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1118/1.1538231 |pmid=12607840 |title=Automatic needle segmentation in three-dimensional ultrasound images using two orthogonal two-dimensional image projections |journal=Medical Physics |volume=30 |issue=2 |pages=222–234 |year=2003 |last1=Ding |first1=Mingyue |last2=Cardinal |first2=H. Neale |last3=Fenster |first3=Aaron }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology has evolved various methods like rotational scanning, slice projection, use of integrated array transducer that helps the surgeons to handle the traumatic cancer patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.wneu.2016.05.007 |pmid=27178235 |title=Intraoperative Ultrasound-Guided Resection of Gliomas: A Meta-Analysis and Review of the Literature |journal=World Neurosurgery |volume=92 |pages=255–263 |year=2016 |last1=Mahboob |first1=Syed |last2=McPhillips |first2=Rachael |last3=Qiu |first3=Zhen |last4=Jiang |first4=Yun |last5=Meggs |first5=Carl |last6=Schiavone |first6=Giuseppe |last7=Button |first7=Tim |last8=Desmulliez |first8=Marc |last9=Demore |first9=Christine |last10=Cochran |first10=Sandy |last11=Eljamel |first11=Sam }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, with the 3D US doctors can now treat various kind of tumors as every tissue can be easily diagnosed and introspected to study the defects and cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3171/2015.12.FOCUS15529 |pmid=26926063 |title=Direct navigated 3D ultrasound for resection of brain tumors: A useful tool for intraoperative image guidance |journal=Neurosurgical Focus |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=E5 |year=2016 |last1=Moiyadi |first1=Aliasgar V. |last2=Shetty |first2=Prakash }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, we see that the ultimate scanning and visualization done by 3D US has developed better ways of treating the patients with problems like cancer, tumors and transplants. 
=== Vascular Imaging ===
Blood vessels and arteries movements are not easy to track because of their distribution due to which capturing a real-time picture becomes difficult. Diagnosis is widely used in every kind of treatment and with the 3D US, it is now possible to track dynamic movement of blood cells, veins and arteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1109/ULTSYM.2014.0472 |chapter=The spatio-temporal variation of rat carotid artery bifurcation by ultrasound imaging |title=2014 IEEE International Ultrasonics Symposium |pages=1900–1903 |year=2014 |last1=Jin |first1=Chang-zhu |last2=Nam |first2=Kweon-Ho |last3=Paeng |first3=Dong-Guk |isbn=978-1-4799-7049-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, various types of diagnosis like measuring the diameter, diagnosing the wall between the arteries can be detected with a magnetic tracker integrated with 3D US that helps in accurate positioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3233/CH-152012 |pmid=26484714 |title=Standardized 2D ultrasound versus 3D/4D ultrasound and image fusion for measurement of aortic aneurysm diameter in follow-up after EVAR |journal=Clinical Hemorheology and Microcirculation |volume=62 |issue=3 |pages=249–260 |year=2016 |last1=Pfister |first1=Karin |last2=Schierling |first2=Wilma |last3=Jung |first3=Ernst Michael |last4=Apfelbeck |first4=Hanna |last5=Hennersperger |first5=Christoph |last6=Kasprzak |first6=Piotr M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; So the technology gives imaging assistance and also has a sensor that helps in tracking the position of vessels in operations. 
=== Regional anesthesia ===
Real-time three-dimensional ultrasound is used during peripheral nerve blockade procedures to identify relevant anatomy and monitor the spread of local anesthetic around the nerve.  Peripheral nerve blockades prevent the transmission of pain signals from the site of injury to the brain without deep sedation, which makes them particularly useful for outpatient orthopedic procedures.  Real-time 3D ultrasound allows muscles, nerves and vessels to be clearly identified while a needle or catheter is advanced under the skin.  3D ultrasound is able to view the needle regardless of the plane of the image, which is a substantial improvement over 2D ultrasound.  Additionally, the image can be rotated or cropped in real time to reveal anatomical structures within a volume of tissue.  Physicians at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville have been developing techniques using real time 3D ultrasound to guide peripheral nerve blocks for shoulder, knee, and ankle surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Real-Time 3-D Ultrasound Speeds Patient Recovery |publisher=Mayo Clinic |date=July 13, 2007 |url=http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/531514/ |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1213/01.ane.0000265439.02497.a7 |pmid=17578987 |title=Real-Time Three-Dimensional Ultrasound for Continuous Popliteal Blockade: A Case Report and Image Description |journal=Anesthesia &amp; Analgesia |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=272–274 |year=2007 |last1=Feinglass |first1=Neil G. |last2=Clendenen |first2=Steven R. |last3=Torp |first3=Klaus D. |last4=Wang |first4=R Doris |last5=Castello |first5=Ramon |last6=Greengrass |first6=Roy A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Artificial Intelligence System''' ('''AIS''') was a [[distributed computing]] project undertaken by Intelligence Realm, Inc. with the long-term goal of simulating the human brain in real time, complete with [[artificial consciousness]] and [[artificial general intelligence]]. They claimed to have found, in research, the "mechanisms of knowledge representation in the brain which is equivalent to finding artificial intelligence",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovguide.com/artificial-intelligence-system-9202a8c04000641f8000000007b55d02# |title=Artificial Intelligence System Video |publisher=OVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving into the developmental phase.

==Science==
The project's initial goal was recreating the largest brain simulation to date, performed by neuroscientist [[Eugene M. Izhikevich]] of The Neurosciences Institute in [[San Diego, California]]. Izhikevich simulated 1 second of activity of 100 billion neurons (the estimated number of neurons in the human brain) in 50 days using a [[Cluster (computing)|cluster]] of 27 3-gigahertz processors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eugene Izhikevich |url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/Blue_Brain.htm#Computer%20Model%20of%20the%20Human%20Brain |title=Computer Model of the Human Brain |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date=2005-10-27 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He extrapolated that a real-time simulation of the brain could not be achieved before 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.izhikevich.org/human_brain_simulation/why.htm|title=why did I do that? |publisher=Vesicle.nsi.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project aimed to disprove this prediction.

On July 12, 2008, AIS announced that the first phase of the project had been completed by reaching the 100 billion neuron mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml |title=The distributed brain |publisher=Information-age.com |date=2009-06-17 |accessdate=2011-06-07| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110720194758/http://www.information-age.com/channels/development-and-integration/perspectives-and-trends/1053102/the-distributed-brain.thtml| archivedate= 20 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project then continued to simulate neurons while they completed the development of the other applications.

AIS simulated the brain via an [[artificial neural network]], and used [[Hodgkin–Huxley model]]s. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The project utilized the [[BOINC]] distributed computing platform. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In version 1.08 of the software each work unit received by a volunteer simulated 500,000 [[neuron]]s for 100 milliseconds at 5 millisecond time steps (the estimated firing rate of a human neuron).{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The application had four primary modules—for creating neurons, simulating neurons, visualizing neurons, and finally, knowledge acquisition. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Intention was that the neuronal generator would eventually use [[genetic algorithms]] to generate neurons for simulation. The neuron simulator used mathematical models to simulate those neurons. Initially Hodgkin–Huxley models were used, but more models (perhaps hundreds) were intended to be utilized in the future. The visualization software was to allow the administrators to monitor and control the neuronal simulators. The knowledge acquisition module involved feeding information to the system and training it to build its knowledge base.

The AIS project had successfully simulated over 700 billion neurons by April 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"The distributed brain"&lt;/ref&gt;

The project was closed in November 2010 as the BOINC program of the project did not work.

      <comment>Made a phrase a bit clearer; "generally, once it reaches consumers" could be read to imply that the fragment applied to the mid-life of the product, rather than to products overall (i.e., it implied that a product is at midlife when it reaches consumers, which is more true in terms of a product's lifecycle, but not true for each instance of a product).</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3460">[[File:Bathtub curve.svg|thumb|right|350px|The 'bathtub curve' hazard function (blue, upper solid line) is a combination of a decreasing hazard of early failure (red dotted line) and an increasing hazard of wear-out failure (yellow dotted line), plus some constant hazard of random failure (green, lower solid line).]]

The '''bathtub curve''' is widely used in [[reliability engineering]]. It describes a particular form of the [[hazard function]] which comprises three parts:

*The first part is a decreasing [[failure rate]], known as early [[failure]]s.
*The second part is a constant failure rate, known as [[random]] failures.
*The third part is an increasing failure rate, known as wear-out failures.

The name is derived from the cross-sectional shape of a [[bathtub]]: steep sides and a flat bottom.

The bathtub curve is generated by mapping the rate of early "infant mortality" failures when first introduced, the rate of random failures with constant failure rate during its "useful life", and finally the rate of "wear out" failures as the product exceeds its design lifetime.

In less technical terms, in the early life of a product adhering to the bathtub curve, the failure rate is high but rapidly decreasing as defective products are identified and discarded, and early sources 
of potential failure such as handling and installation error are surmounted. In the mid-life of a product—generally speaking for consumer products—the failure rate is low and constant. In the late life of the product, the failure rate increases, as age and wear take their toll on the product. Many consumer product life cycles strongly exhibit the bathtub curve.&lt;ref name="lienig"&gt;{{Cite book|author=J. Lienig, H. Bruemmer|title=Fundamentals of Electronic Systems Design|url=https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-3-319-55840-0|pp=54|publisher=Springer International Publishing|date=2017|isbn=978-3-319-55839-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the bathtub curve is useful, not every product or system follows a bathtub curve hazard function, for example if units are retired or have decreased use during or before the onset of the wear-out period, they will show fewer failures per unit calendar time (not per unit use time) than the bathtub curve.

The term "[[United States Military Standard|Military Specification]]" is often used to describe systems in which the infant mortality section of the bathtub curve has been [[Burn-in|burned out]] or removed. This is done mainly for life-critical or system-critical applications as it greatly reduces the possibility of the system failing early in its life. Manufacturers will do this at some cost generally by means similar to [[environmental stress screening]].

In reliability engineering, the [[cumulative distribution function]] corresponding to a bathtub curve may be analysed using a [[Weibull chart]].&lt;ref name="lienig" /&gt;

[[Image:Layingpress1.jpg|thumb|200px|Wooden laying press holding a book being worked on.]]
'''Bindery''' refers to a [[studio]], [[workshop]] or [[factory]] where sheets of (usually) paper are fastened together to make books, but also where gold and other decorative elements are added to the exterior of books, where boxes or [[slipcase]]s for books are made and where the restoration of books is carried out.

==Overview==
A large traditional hand bookbinding studio or workshop may be divided into areas for different tasks such as sewing, rounding and backing the spine, attaching the boards to the book and covering the book with cloth or leather. These processes are collectively called forwarding and would be carried out in the forwarding department. This area of the bindery would typically have equipment such as sewing frames, guillotines, board choppers for cutting boards used as covers, laying presses for holding books when being worked on and nipping presses for flattening paper, board, etc. 
Recently, some compact material have been developed, allowing the processing of almost all the operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kirlinov.fr | title = Bookbinding device Kirl'inov | accessdate = 2011-06-01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Brasstools1.jpg|thumb|200px|Racks of brass tools and a finishing stove beneath.]]
The process of decorating or titling a book with gold or other metals, and/or different colored pieces of leather, is called [[finishing (bookbinding)|finishing]] and is carried out in the finishing room or department. In a hand bookbindery this area would house the dozens or hundreds of brass hand tools that are used to impress gold patterns and figures onto leather one at a time, as well as the finishing stoves needed to heat these tools. In a more modern or commercial bindery, many decorative elements or letters are stamped onto a book's cover or case at the same time by use of a hot press. 

Modern, commercial, bookbinding outfits range in size from the local "copy shop" book binder, using techniques such as [[coil binding]], [[comb binding]] and [[velo binding]] to factories producing tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of volumes a day using such processes as [[perfect binding]], saddle wire binding, and case binding. The term, bindery, especially in copy and print shops, has expanded to include other forms of paper finishing, such as [[paper drilling]], [[lamination]], and [[foamcore]] mounting.

{{Refimprove|date=August 2014}}[[File:Cairn at Garvera, Surselva, Graubuenden, Switzerland.jpg|right|thumb|200px|A cairn marking a mountain summit in [[Graubünden]], [[Switzerland]] ]]
A '''cairn''' is a human-made pile (or stack) of stones. The word ''cairn'' comes from the {{lang-gd|càrn}} {{IPA-gd|ˈkʰaːrˠn̪ˠ||}} (plural {{lang|gd|càirn}} {{IPA-gd|ˈkʰaːrˠɲ||}}).&lt;ref&gt;Peter Drummond, ''Scottish Hill Names'', Scottish Mountaineering Trust (2010), {{ISBN|978-0-907521-95-2}}, page 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairns have been and are used for a broad variety of purposes, from prehistoric times to the present.

In [[modern time]]s, cairns are often erected as [[landmark]]s, a use they have had since [[ancient times]]. However, since [[prehistory]], they have also been built and used as [[Sepulchre|burial]] monuments; for defense and hunting; for ceremonial purposes, sometimes relating to  [[astronomy]]; to locate buried items, such as caches of food or objects; and to mark trails, among other purposes.

[[File:Cairn Northumberland and Durham.jpg|thumb|Cairn at the boundary of Counties Durham and Northumberland UK]]

Cairns are used as [[Trail blazing|trail markers]] in many parts of the world, in [[Upland (geology)|uplands]], on  [[moorland]],   on  [[Summit (topography)|mountaintops]], near [[waterway]]s and on [[sea cliff]]s, as well as in barren [[desert]]s and [[tundra]]. They vary in size from small stone markers to entire artificial hills, and in complexity from loose conical rock piles to delicately balanced sculptures and elaborate feats of [[megalith]]ic engineering. Cairns may be painted or otherwise decorated, whether for increased visibility or for religious reasons. An ancient example is the [[inuksuk]] (plural inuksuit), used by the [[Inuit]], [[Inupiat]], [[Kalaallit]], [[Yupik peoples|Yupik]], and other peoples of the [[Arctic]] region of North America.  Inuksuit are found from [[Alaska]] to [[Greenland]]. This region, above the [[Arctic Circle]], is dominated by the tundra [[biome]] and has areas with few natural [[landmark]]s.

==Modern cairns==
[[File:Lion's Head snow.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1.2|Line of cairns used to mark the way above the treeline on [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington, New Hampshire]], US]]
Different types of cairns exist from rough piles of stones to interlocking dry stone round cylinders.  The most important cairns commonly used around the world are interlocking stone survey cairns constructed around a central survey mark about every 30&amp;nbsp;km on the tallest peaks across a nation. These physical survey mark cairn systems are the basis for national survey grids to interconnect individual land survey measurements for entire nations. On occasion these permanent interlocking stone cairns are taken down then reconstructed to re-mark measurements to increase the accuracy of the national survey grid. They can also be used in unpopulated countries as emergency location points.  In [[North America]] and [[Northern Europe]] any type of cairn can be used to mark [[mountain bike]] and [[hiking trail]]s and other cross-country [[trail blazing]], especially in mountain regions at or above the [[tree line]]. For example, the extensive trail network maintained by the DNT, the [[Norwegian Trekking Association]], extensively uses cairns in conjunction with T-painted rock faces to mark trails.  Other examples of these can be seen in the lava fields of [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park|Volcanoes National Park]] to mark several hikes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/havo/planyourvisit/hike_bc.htm |title=Backcountry Hikes - Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park |publisher=Nps.gov |date=2012-04-26 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Placed at regular intervals, a series of cairns can be used to indicate a path across stony or barren terrain, even across [[glacier]]s. Such cairns are often placed at junctions or in places where the trail direction is not obvious. They may also be used to indicate an obscured danger such as a sudden drop, or a noteworthy point such as the summit of a mountain.  Most trail cairns are small, usually being a foot or less in height. However, they may be built taller so as to protrude through a layer of snow. Hikers passing by often add a stone, as a small bit of maintenance to counteract the erosive effects of severe weather. North American trail marks are sometimes called "ducks" or "duckies", because they sometimes have a "beak" pointing in the direction of the route. The expression "two rocks do not make a duck" reminds hikers that just one rock resting upon another could be the result of accident or nature rather than intentional trail marking.

The building of cairns for recreational purposes along trails, to mark one's personal passage through the area, can result in an overabundance of rock piles. This distracts from cairns used as genuine navigational guides, and also conflicts with the [[Leave No Trace]] ethic. This ethic of outdoor practice advocates for leaving the outdoors undisturbed and in its natural condition.
[[File:Isandlwanamassgrave.JPG|left|thumb|200px|One of many cairns marking British mass graves at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] (1879), [[South Africa]]]]
Coastal cairns, or "sea marks", are also common in the northern latitudes, especially in the island-strewn waters of [[Scandinavia]] and eastern [[Canada]]. Often indicated on navigation charts, they may be painted white or lit as beacons for greater visibility offshore.

Modern cairns may also be erected for historical or memorial commemoration or simply for decorative or artistic reasons. One example is a series of many cairns marking [[United Kingdom|British]] soldiers' [[mass graves]] at the site of the [[Battle of Isandlwana]], [[South Africa]]. Another is the [[Matthew Flinders]] Cairn on the side of [[Arthur's Seat, Victoria|Arthur's Seat]], a small mountain on the shores of [[Port Phillip Bay]], [[Australia]]. A large cairn, commonly referred to as "the igloo" by the locals, was built atop a hill next to the [[I-476]] highway in [[Radnor, Pennsylvania]] and is a part of a series of large rock sculptures initiated in 1988 to symbolize the township's [[Wales|Welsh]] heritage and to beautify the visual imagery along the highway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 Radnor Township website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820120212/http://www.radnor.com/department/division.asp?fDD=9-108 |date=2007-08-20 }}, Gateway Enhancement Strategy.&lt;/ref&gt; Some are merely places where farmers have collected stones removed from a field. These can be seen in the [[Catskill Mountains]], [[North America]] where there is a strong Scottish heritage, and may also represent places where livestock were lost. In locales exhibiting fantastic rock formations, such as the [[Grand Canyon]], tourists often construct simple cairns in reverence of the larger counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;[[:commons:File:Cairns at Grand Canyon North Rim 2013.jpg]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, cairns may have a strong aesthetic purpose, for example in the art of [[Andy Goldsworthy]].

===Illegal construction===
Norwegian authorities said in 2015 that illegal cairns are being built each year, to a large degree by tourists to Norway; part of the problem is that individual stones are being removed from registered- and unregistered ''kulturminner'' (e.g., historical monuments).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrk.no/finnmark/_-ulovlige-varder-er-blitt-en-farsott-1.12499962 – Ulovlige varder er blitt en farsott] [– Illegal cairns have become a craze]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Clear}}

===Europe===
The building of cairns for various purposes goes back into [[prehistory]] in [[Eurasia]], ranging in size from small rock sculptures to substantial man-made hills of stone (some built on top of larger, natural hills). The latter are often relatively massive [[Bronze Age]] or earlier structures which, like kistvaens and [[dolmen]]s, frequently contain burials; they are comparable to [[Tumulus|tumuli]] ([[kurgan]]s), but of stone construction instead of [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthworks]]. ''Cairn'' originally could more broadly refer to various types of hills and natural stone piles, but today is used exclusively of artificial ones.
[[File:Cairn Gavrinis exterieur.jpg|thumb|Cairn of the [[Neolithic]]-era [[passage grave]] on [[Gavrinis]] island, [[Brittany]]]]
The word ''cairn'' derives from [[Scots language|Scots]] {{lang|gd|cairn}} (with the same meaning), in turn from [[Scottish Gaelic]] {{lang|gd|càrn}}, which is essentially the same as the corresponding words in other native [[Celtic language]]s of [[Great Britain|Britain]], [[Ireland]] and [[Brittany]], including [[Welsh language|Welsh]] {{lang|cy|carn}} (and {{lang|cy|carnedd}}), [[Breton language|Breton]] {{lang|br|karn}}, [[Irish language|Irish]] {{lang|ga|carn}}, and [[Cornish language|Cornish]] {{lang|kw|karn}} or {{lang|kw|carn}}.  Cornwall ({{lang|kw|Kernow}}) itself may actually be named after the cairns that dot its landscape, such as Cornwall's highest point, [[Brown Willy Cairns|Brown Willy Summit Cairn]], a 5&amp;nbsp;m (16&amp;nbsp;ft) high and 24&amp;nbsp;m (79&amp;nbsp;ft) diameter mound atop [[Brown Willy]] hill in [[Bodmin Moor]], an area with many ancient cairns.  Burial cairns and other [[megalith]]s are the subject of a variety of legends and folklore throughout Britain and Ireland. In [[Scotland]], it is traditional to carry a stone up from the bottom of a hill to place on a cairn at its top. In such a fashion, cairns would grow ever larger. An old Scottish Gaelic blessing is {{lang|gd|Cuiridh mi clach air do chàrn}}, "I'll put a stone on your stone".  In Highland folklore it is recounted that before Highland clans fought in a battle, each man would place a stone in a pile. Those who survived the battle returned and removed a stone from the pile. The stones that remained were built into a cairn to honour the dead. Cairns in the region were also put to vital practical use. For example, [[Dún Aonghasa]], an all-stone [[Iron Age]] Irish [[hill fort]] on [[Inishmore]] in the [[Aran Islands]], is still surrounded by small cairns and strategically placed jutting rocks, used collectively as an alternative to [[Defensive wall|defensive earthworks]] because of the [[karst]] landscape's lack of soil.
[[File:BorderPost272 - Norway and Sweden.jpg|thumb|The [[Stone Cairn (Riksrösen)|Riksrösen]] divide Norway and Sweden.]]
In [[Scandinavia]], cairns have been used for centuries as trail and sea marks, among other purposes. In [[Iceland]], cairns were often used as markers along the numerous single-file roads or paths that crisscrossed the island; many of these ancient cairns are still standing, although the paths have disappeared. In [[Norse Greenland]], cairns were used as a hunting implement, a game-driving "lane", used to direct reindeer towards a [[game jump]].&lt;ref&gt;Arneborg 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mythology of ancient Greece, cairns were associated with [[Hermes]], the god of overland travel. According to one legend, Hermes was put on trial by [[Hera]] for slaying her favorite servant, the monster [[Argus Panoptes|Argus]]. All of the other gods acted as a jury, and as a way of declaring their verdict they were given pebbles, and told to throw them at whichever person they deemed to be in the right, Hermes or Hera. Hermes argued so skillfully that he ended up buried under a heap of pebbles, and this was the first cairn.
In [[Croatia]], in areas of ancient [[Dalmatia]], such as [[Herzegovina]] and the [[Krajina]], they are known as ''gromila''.

In [[Portugal]] a cairn is called  a {{lang|pt|moledro}}. In a legend the moledros are enchanted soldiers, and if one stone is taken from the pile and put under a pillow, in the morning a soldier will appear for a brief moment, then will change back to a stone and magically return to the pile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Genética e a Teoria da Continuidade Paleolítica aplicada à Lenda da Fundação de Portugal e Escócia Apenas Livros|year=2008|isbn=978-989-618-180-2|url=http://www.continuitas.org/texts/morais_genetica.pdf|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cairns that mark the place where someone died or cover the graves alongside the roads where in the past people were buried are called {{lang|pt|Fiéis de Deus}}. The same name given to the stones was given to  the dead whose identity was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SoUyAQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Diccionario+da+lingua+portugueza:+recopilado+dos+vocabularios+impressos#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Diccionario da lingua portugueza:recopilado dos vocabularios impressos até agora, e nesta segunda edição novamente emendado, e muito accrescentado, Volume 2. pg 31 |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30|year=1813 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|gl|Fieis de Deus}} or {{lang|gl|Fes de Deus}} are, in the Galician legends, spirits of the night. The word "Fes" or "Fieis" is thought to mean [[fairy]], the same root as "fate"&lt;ref&gt;[http://sli.uvigo.es/ddd/ddd_pescuda.php?pescuda=fes&amp;tipo_busca=lema ''Dicionario de Dicionarios.

"Entienden por éstos o estas fes los espíritus nocturnos, fantasmas, espectros, etc. Acaso serán lo mismo que las fees en francés, y todo de fata." Retrieved January 26, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; (''fado''), that can take the same meaning as the proto-Celtic *bato-, meaning "death".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spns.org.uk/ProtoCelt.pdf |title=Proto-Celtic―English |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cairns are also common on the [[Mediterranean]] island of [[Corsica]].{{clarify|date=March 2012|reason=Please give examples}}

===North and northeast Africa===
[[File:Qableh3.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Ancient cairns in [[Qa’ableh]], [[Somalia]]]]
Cairns (''taalo'') are a common feature at [[El Ayo]], [[Haylan]], [[Qa’ableh]], [[Qombo'ul]], [[Heis (town)|Heis]], [[Salweyn]] and [[Macajilayn]], among other places. Northern [[Somalia]] in general is home to a lot of such historical settlements and [[archaeological site]]s wherein are found numerous ancient ruins and buildings, many of obscure origins. However, many of these old structures have yet to be properly explored, a process which would help shed further light on local history and facilitate their preservation for posterity.&lt;ref name="Hodd"&gt;Michael Hodd, ''East African Handbook'', (Trade &amp; Travel Publications: 1994), p.640.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[Neolithic]] times, the climate of [[North Africa]] has become drier. A reminder of the [[desertification]] of the area is provided by [[megalith]]ic remains, which occur in a great variety of forms and in vast numbers in presently arid and uninhabitable wastelands: cairns (''kerkour''), [[dolmen]]s and circles like [[Stonehenge]], underground cells excavated in rock, [[Long barrow|barrows]] topped with huge slabs, and step [[pyramid]]-like mounds.

===Asia and the Pacific===
Starting in the [[Bronze Age]],{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=WHERE?!? "Asia" is huge.}} burial [[cist]]s were sometimes interred into cairns, which would be situated in conspicuous positions, often on the skyline above the village of the deceased. The stones may have been thought to deter grave robbers and scavengers. A more sinister explanation is that they were to [[Revenant (folklore)|stop the dead from rising]]. There remains a [[Judaism|Jewish]] tradition of placing small stones on a person's grave as a token of respect, though this is generally to relate the longevity of stone to the eternal nature of the soul and is not usually done in a cairn fashion. [[Stupa]]s in India and [[Tibet]] probably started out in a similar fashion, although they now generally contain the ashes of a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] saint or [[lama]].

[[File:TallOvoo.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Mongolian ceremonial cairn (''[[ovoo]]'')]]A traditional and often decorated, heap-formed cairn called an ''[[ovoo]]'' is made in [[Mongolia]]. It primarily serves religious purposes, and finds use in both [[Tengriism|Tengriist]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ceremonies.

In [[Hawaii]], cairns are called by the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] word {{lang|haw|ahu}}.{{clarify|date=March 2011|reason=So what? Is this an ancient thing? If so, tell us about it and cite sources. If it's just the word for modern trail cairns on the volcanoes, then remove this entire paragraph since this isn't Wiktionary, and WP isn't here to provide translation services.}}

In [[South Korea]] cairns are quite prevalent, often found along roadsides and trails, up on mountain peaks, and adjacent to Buddhist temples.  Hikers frequently add stones to existing cairns trying to get just one more on top of the pile, to bring good luck.  This tradition has its roots in the worship of San-shin, or Mountain Spirit, so often still revered in Korean culture.&lt;ref name="san"&gt;{{cite book | title=Spirit of the Mountains - Korea's San-Shin and Traditions of Mountain Worship| last=Mason| first=David| year=1999| page=41| publisher=Hollym International Corp.| location=Seoul, South Korea and Elizabeth, New Jersey| isbn=1-56591-107-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Americas===
[[File:Flag of Nunavut.svg|thumb|An inuksuk on the [[flag of Nunavut]]]]
Throughout what today are the [[continental United States]] and Canada, cairns still mark [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]]' game-driving "lanes" leading to [[buffalo jump]]s, some of which may date to 12,000 years ago.
Natives of arctic North America (i.e. northern Canada, [[Alaska]] and indigenous [[Greenland]]) have built carefully constructed cairns and stone sculptures, called by names such as [[Inuksuk|{{lang|iu|inuksuit|nocat=yes}} and {{lang|iu|inunnguat|nocat=yes}}]], as landmarks and directional markers since [[European colonization of the Americas|before contact with Europeans]]. They are iconic of the region (an {{lang|iu|inuksuk}} even features on the flag of the Canadian far-northeastern territory, [[Nunavut]]), and are increasingly used as a symbol of Canadian national identity. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In North America, cairns are often [[petroform]]s in the shapes of turtles or other animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Cairns have been used since [[pre-Columbian]] times throughout what is now [[Latin America]] to mark trails. Even today, in the [[Andes]] of [[South America]], the [[Quechuan]] peoples use cairns as religious shrines to the indigenous [[Inca]] goddess [[Pachamama]]. This is often part of a [[Syncretism|syncretic]] form of [[Roman Catholicism]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}
{{clear|left}}

==Anthropomorphism==
Although the practice is not common in [[Modern English language|English]], cairns are sometimes referred to by their [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities. In [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], a cairn is known as {{lang|de|steinmann}} and {{lang|nl|steenman}} respectively, meaning literally "stone man".  A form of the [[Inuit]] {{lang|iu|[[inuksuk]]}} is also meant to represent a human figure, and is called an {{lang|iu|inunguak}} ("imitation of a person"). In Italy, especially the [[Italian Alps]], a cairn is an {{lang|it|ometto}}, or a "small man".
&lt;!--Don't need this yet: {{clear|right}}--&gt;

==Sea cairns==
[[File:Kummel Korpo 2009.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Sea mark]] in [[Finland|Finnish]] coastal waters]]
Coastal cairns called [[sea mark]]s are also common in the northern latitudes, and are placed along shores and on islands and islets. Usually painted white for improved offshore visibility, they serve as [[Navigational aid|navigation aid]]s. In [[Sweden]] they are called {{lang|sv|kummel}}, in Norway {{lang|no|varde}}, and are indicated in navigation charts and maintained as part of the nautical marking system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |url=http://portal.fma.fi/portal/page/portal/589032C37AAC7314E040B40A0A016368 |title=Legend (INT Symbology) |format=PDF |location=[[Helsinki]] |publisher=Finnish Transport Agency and Finnish Transport Safety Agency (TraFi) |work=Merenkulku.fi |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126004546/http://portal.fma.fi/portal/page/portal/589032C37AAC7314E040B40A0A016368 |archivedate=2012-01-26 |df= }} Three-language key to reading Finnish navigation charts.&lt;/ref&gt; Inversely, they are used on land as sea cliff warnings in rugged and hilly terrain in the foggy [[Faroe Islands]]. In the [[Maritimes|Canadian Maritimes]], cairns have been used as beacons like small [[lighthouse]]s to guide boats, as depicted in the novel ''[[The Shipping News]]''.

==Methods==

===Preservation===
Archaeological leather artifacts are preserved in stable environments, either in constantly [[humid]], [[wikt:dry|dry]] or [[Freezing|frozen]] sites. Peat bogs also preserve leather and skin artifacts, but through a re-tanning process.&lt;ref&gt;Painter, T. J., “Chemical and Microbiological Aspects of the Preservation Process in Spagnum Peat”, in Turner, R.C., Scaife, R. G., Bog Bodies, New Discoveries and New Perspectives, British Museum Press, London, 1995, 88–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Water-logged archaeological sites provide the necessary conditions for the preservation of vegetable tanned leather. As an organic material, water-logged archaeological leather needs to be stabilized by an appropriate conservation method.&lt;ref&gt;E. Cameron / J. Spriggs / B. Wills, "The conservation of archaeological leather.", ''Conservation of Leather'', Oxford, 2006, pp. 244–261&lt;/ref&gt; Dry conditions may be found in [[desert]]s and at high altitudes but also within the walls of medieval and later period buildings where leather shoes were [[concealed shoes|concealed]] for superstitious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, J., 'Shoes Concealed in Buildings', ''Costume Society Journal'', No. 30, 1996, pp. 56–69&lt;/ref&gt; Ice fields, tundra and glaciers can occasionally preserve ancient leather artifacts through constant freezing.&lt;ref&gt;W. Groenman-van Waateringe /R. Goedecker-Ciolek, "The equipment made of hide and leather", ''Der Mann im Eis'' Band 1, Innsbruck, 1992, pp. 410–418&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examination of archaeological shoe finds==
Water-logged finds generally consist of loose components since the [[thread (yarn)|thread]]s used to [[sew]] the objects together does not survive humid [[burial]]. A tracking system should be used for keeping the loose components in order throughout the [[analysis]] and [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] processes. For wet archaeological leather, the first step is cleaning gently in water with a small soft [[brush]]. Conservation is preferably performed after the [[document]]ation phase. Documentation consists of [[drawing]]s and written notes, [[photograph]]ic records are less useful since blackish leather does not show fine detail well. The first step for the Goubitz notation registration is an exact tracing of the fragment’s outline, usually positioned grain side down, flesh side up. Then [[symbol]]s that indicate the type of [[stitch (textile arts)|stitch]]es and seams are drawn in their appropriate place inside the outline.&lt;ref&gt;O. Goubitz, ''Stepping Through Time'', Zwolle, 2001. pp. 35–40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sole (shoe)|Sole]] constructions (the way in which the upper parts of the shoe is fixed to the sole),&lt;ref&gt;O. Goubitz, ''Stepping Through Time'', Zwolle, 2001, p. 91-98&lt;/ref&gt; [[fastener|fastening method]] and ensembles of components from the same shoe as well as [[animal]] type, leather thickness, folds and creases should be noted. If present, decoration type and technique used should also be recorded.&lt;ref&gt;O. Goubitz, ''Stepping Through Time'', Zwolle, 2001, p.41-55&lt;/ref&gt;

Most archaeological recovered leather artifacts are parts of footwear and may be combined with [[wood]], [[fibre]] or [[metal]] parts. The technical details such as shoe construction technique, fastening method and fashion elements are used to establish a [[Typology (archaeology)|typology]] for a specific find group. Shoe type indicates the kinds of footwear such as [[boot]]s, shoes, pattens, overshoes, etcetera. Shoe style is the consistent combination of a fastening method, height, fashion and decoration elements on a significant quantity of recovered shoes. Style nomenclature based on find place's name has been partly established for Roman period finds.&lt;ref&gt;C. van Driel-Murray, 'Footwear in the North-Western Provinces of the Roman Empire',''Stepping Through Time'', Zwolle, 2001, pp. 362–327&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changes in fashion and the fact that shoes have a limited [[service life|life span]] due to use, footwear is a chronologically sensitive material excavation and represents a closely dated chronological source for archeology. The find context, stratigraphic placement and other [[Dating methodology (archaeology)|dating methods]] contribute to establishing a specific chronology. Further research for comparative parallel examples among the existing archaeological archives (collections, publications, reports) helps to define a relative chronology for the shoe types and styles.

'''Chromium dioxide''' or '''chromium(IV) oxide''' is an [[inorganic compound]] with the formula CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a black [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] [[magnetism|magnetic]] solid.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}} &lt;/ref&gt;  It once was widely used in [[magnetic tape]] [[emulsion]].&lt;ref name=ullmanns&gt;{{Ullmann | author = Gerd Anger, Jost Halstenberg, Klaus Hochgeschwender, Christoph Scherhag, Ulrich Korallus, Herbert Knopf, Peter Schmidt, Manfred Ohlinger | title = Chromium Compounds | doi =10.1002/14356007.a07_067}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing popularity of [[compact disc|CDs]] and [[DVD]]s, the use of chromium(IV) oxide has declined. However, it is still used in data tape applications for enterprise-class storage systems. It is still considered by many oxide and tape manufacturers to have been one of the best magnetic recording particulates ever invented.

==Preparation and basic properties==
CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was first prepared by [[Friedrich Wöhler]] by decomposition of [[chromyl chloride]].  [[Crystal habit|Acicular]] chromium dioxide was first synthesized in 1956 by Norman L. Cox, a chemist at [[DuPont|E.I. DuPont]], by decomposing [[chromium trioxide]] in the presence of water at a temperature of 800 K and a pressure of 200 [[Pascal (unit)|MPa]]. The balanced equation for the [[hydrothermal synthesis]] is:
:3 CrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   →   5 CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The magnetic crystal that forms is a long, slender glass-like rod — perfect as a magnetic pigment for recording tape. When commercialized in the late 1960s as a recording medium, DuPont assigned it the tradename of ''Magtrieve''.

CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adopts the [[rutile structure]] (as do many metal dioxides).  As such each Cr(IV) center has [[octahedral coordination geometry]] and each oxide is trigonal planar.&lt;ref name=G&amp;E/&gt;

==Uses==
The crystal’s magnetic properties, derived from its ideal shape such as  [[anisotropy]] which imparted high [[coercivity]] and remanent magnetization intensities, resulted in exceptional stability and efficiency for short [[wavelengths]], and it almost immediately appeared in high performance audio tape used in [[compact audio cassette|audio cassette]] for which treble response and hiss were always problems. Unlike the spongy looking [[ferric oxide]]s used in common tape, the chromium dioxide crystals were perfectly formed and could be evenly and densely dispersed in a magnetic coating; and that led to unparalleled low noise in audio tapes. Chrome tapes did, however, require a new generation of audiocassette recorders equipped with a higher [[tape bias|bias]] current capability (roughly 50% greater) than that used by iron oxide to properly magnetize the tape particles. Also introduced was a new equalization (70 [[µs]]) that traded some of the extended high-frequency response for lower noise resulting in a 5–6 [[Decibel|dB]] improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over ferric-oxide audio tapes. These bias and EQ settings were later carried over to “chrome-equivalent” cobalt-modified tapes introduced in the mid 1970s by [[TDK]], [[Maxell]], and others. Later research significantly increased the coercivity of the particle by doping or adsorbing rare elements such as [[iridium]] onto the crystal matrix or by improving the axial length-to-deprecated{{huh|date=August 2017}} ratios. The resulting product was potentially a competitor to metallic iron pigments but apparently achieved little market penetration.

===Problems===
Until manufacturers developed new ways to mill the oxide, the crystals could easily be broken in the manufacturing process, and this led to excessive [[print-through]] (echo). Output from a tape could drop about 1&amp;nbsp;[[decibel|dB]] or so in a year's time. Although the decrease was uniform across the frequency range and noise also dropped the same amount, preserving the dynamic range, the decrease misaligned [[Dolby]] noise reduction decoders that were sensitive to level settings. The chrome coating was harder than competitive coatings, and that led to accusations of excessive head wear. Although the tape wore hard [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]] heads faster than oxide based tapes, it actually wore softer [[permalloy]] heads at a slower rate; and head wear was more a problem for permalloy heads than for ferrite heads. The head wear scare and licensing issues with DuPont kept blank consumer chrome tapes at a great disadvantage versus the eventually more popular Type II tapes that used cobalt-modified iron oxide, but chrome was the tape of choice for the music industry's cassette releases. Because of its low [[Curie temperature]] (approximately {{convert|386|K|F}}), chrome tape lent itself to high-speed [https://web.archive.org/web/20150403010618/http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1063031 thermomagnetic duplication] of audio and video cassettes for pre-recorded product sales to the consumer and industrial markets.

==Producers==
DuPont licensed the product to [[Sony]] in Japan and [[BASF]] in Germany in the early 1970s for regional production and distribution. Japanese competitors &lt;!--of Sony resented payment of licensing fees to it for use of the pigment, they--&gt; developed cobalt-adsorbed (TDK: ''Avilyn'') and cobalt ferrite (Maxell: ''[[Epitaxial]]'') "chrome equivalent" Type II audio cassettes and various videotape formats as substitutes. Added to that was the problem that the production of CrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yielded toxic by-products of which Japanese manufacturers had great difficulty properly disposing. BASF eventually became the largest producer of both the chromium dioxide pigment and chrome tapes, basing its [[VHS]] &amp; [[S-VHS]] video tape, audio cassettes, and 3480 data cartridges on this formulation. Dupont and BASF had also introduced chrome-cobalt "blended" oxide pigments which combined about 70% cobalt-modified iron oxide with 30% chrome oxide into a single coating, presumably to offer improved performance at lower costs than pure chrome. Many high grade VHS tapes also used much smaller amounts of chrome in their formulations because its magnetic properties combined with its cleaning effects on heads made it a better choice than [[aluminium oxide]] or other non-magnetic materials added to VHS tape to keep heads clean. Dupont discontinued its production of chromium dioxide particles in the 1990s. In addition to BASF, which no longer owns a tape manufacturing division, Bayer AG of Germany, Toda Kogyo and Sakai Chemical of Japan also do or can produce the magnetic particles for commercial applications.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12669">[[Image:CapeLogo.jpg|thumb|CAPE International Conference logo]]
'''Computer-aided production engineering''' (CAPE) is a relatively new and significant branch of engineering. Global manufacturing has changed the environment in which goods are produced.  Meanwhile, the rapid development of electronics and communication technologies has required design and manufacturing to keep pace.{{ref|intro1}}

==Description of CAPE==

CAPE is seen as a new     type of [[Computer-aided design|computer-aided]] engineering environment which will improve the productivity of manufacturing/industrial engineers. This environment would be used by engineers to design and implement future manufacturing systems and subsystems. Work is currently underway at the United States [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) on CAPE systems. The NIST project is aimed at advancing the development of software environments and tools for the design and engineering of manufacturing systems.{{ref|desc1}}

==CAPE and the Future of Manufacturing==

The future of [[manufacturing]] will be determined by the efficiency with which it can incorporate new [[technologies]]. The current process in engineering manufacturing systems is often [[ad hoc]], with computerized tools being used on a limited basis. Given the costs and resources involved in the construction and operation of manufacturing systems, the engineering process must be made more efficient. New computing environments for engineering manufacturing systems could help achieve that objective.

Why is CAPE important? In much the same way that [[Industrial design|product designers]] need computer-aided design systems, manufacturing and industrial engineers need sophisticated computing capabilities to solve complex problems and manage the vast data associated with the design of a manufacturing system.

In order to solve these complex problems and manage [[Data-driven design|design data]], computerized tools must be used in the application of [[scientific]] and engineering methods to the problem of the
design and implementation of manufacturing systems. [[Engineers]] must address the entire [[factory]] as a system and the interactions of that system with its surrounding environment.
Components of a factory system include:
* the [[physical plant]] housing the manufacturing facility;
* the production facilities which perform the manufacturing operations;
* the technologies used in the production facility;
* the work centers/stations, [[machinery]], equipment, tools, and materials which comprise or are used by the production facilities;
* the various support facilities;
* the relationship between the factory and its environment.

CAPE must not only be concerned with the initial design and engineering of the factory, it must also address enhancements over time. CAPE should support standard engineering methods and problem-solving techniques, [[automation|automate]] mundane tasks, and provide reference data to support the decision-making process.

The environment should be designed to help engineers become more productive and effective in their work. This would be implemented on [[personal computers]] or engineering workstations which have been configured with appropriate peripheral devices. Engineering tool developers will have to integrate the functions and data used by a number of different disciplines, for example:
* manufacturing, industrial and plant engineering;
* materials processing and quality engineering;
* environmental engineering,
* mathematical modeling/simulation, statistical process control and computer science,
* economic and cost analysis and management science,

Many of the methods, formulas, and data associated with these technical areas currently exist only in engineering handbooks. Although some computerized tools are available, they are often very specialized, difficult to use, and do not share information or work together. Engineering tools built by different vendors must be made compatible through [[open systems architecture]]s and interface standards.{{ref|fut1}}

==What CAPE will look like==

CAPE will be based upon computer systems providing an integrated set of design and engineering tools.  These software tools will be used by a company’s manufacturing engineers to continuously improve its production systems. They will maintain information about manufacturing resources, enhance production capabilities, and develop new facilities and systems. Engineers working on different workstations will share information through a common database.

Using CAPE, an engineering team will prepare detailed plans and working models for an entire factory in a matter of days. Alternative solutions to production problems could be quickly developed and evaluated. This would be a significant improvement over current manual methods which may require weeks or months of intensive activity.

To achieve this goal, a new set of engineering tools are needed. Examples of functions which should be supported include:
* identification of product specifications and production requirements;
* producibility analysis for products and modification of product designs to address manufacturability issues and management, scheduling and tracking of projects;
* modeling and specification of manufacturing processes and plant layout and facilities planning;
* consideration of various economic/cost tradeoffs of different manufacturing processes, systems, tools, and materials;
* analysis supporting selection of systems/vendors and procurement of manufacturing equipment and support systems;
* task and work place design;
* compliance with various regulations, specifications, and standards, and control of hazardous materials.

The tools implementing these functions must be highly automated and integrated; and will need to provide quick access to a wide range of data. This data must be maintained in a format that is accessible and usable by the engineering tools. Some examples of the information that might be contained in these electronic libraries include:
* production process models and data and generic manufacturing systems configurations;
* machinery and equipment specifications, and vendor catalogs;
* recommended methods, practices, algorithms, etc., and benchmarking data;
* typical plant/system layouts,
* cost estimation models, labor rates, other cost data and budget templates,
* time standards, industrial standards, project plans, and laws/government regulations.

These on-line libraries would allow engineers to quickly develop solutions based upon the work of others.

Another critical aspect of this engineering environment is affordability, which
can best be achieved by designing an environment that can be constructed from low cost "off-the-shelf" commercial products, rather than custombuilt computer hardware and software. The basic engineering environment must be affordable. For both cost and technical reasons, it must be designed to be able to support incremental upgrades. Incremental upgrades would allow companies to add capabilities as they are needed. Commercial software products must be easy to install and integrate with other software already in use. These capabilities exist to a limited extent in some general purpose commercial software today, e.g., word processors, databases, spreadsheets.{{ref|look}}

==Technical Concerns==

Many technical issues must be considered in the design and development of new engineering tools for CAPE. These issues include:
* required functionality of the tools themselves;
* formalization and refinement of engineering methods;
* development of on-line technical reference libraries, and user engineering and graphics visualization; 
* user engineering and graphics visualization techniques;
* system connectivity and information sharing, and integration standards for the computing environment;
* incorporation of intelligent behavior in the tools.

There are three critical elements to be addressed: creating a common manufacturing systems information model; using an engineering life cycle approach; and developing a software tool integration framework.

Resolution of these elements will help ensure that independently developed systems will be able to work together.  The common information model should identify the elements of the manufacturing system and their relationships to each other; the functions or processes performed by each element; the tools, materials, and information required to perform those functions; and measures of effectiveness for the model and its component elements.

There have been many efforts over the years to develop information models for different
aspects of manufacturing, but no known existing model fully meets the needs of a CAPE ernviroment. Therefore, a [[New product development|life cycle]] approach is needed to identify the different processes that a CAPE environment must support, and must define all phases of a manufacturing system or subsystem’s existence. Some of the major phases which may be included in a system life cycle approach are, requirements identification; system design specification; vendor selection; system development and upgrades; installation, testing, and training; and benchmarking of production operations.

Management, coordination, and administration functions need to be performed during each phase of the life cycle. Phases may be repeated over time as a system is upgraded or re-engineered to meet changing needs or incorporate new technologies.

A software tool integration framework should specify how the tools could be independently designed and developed. The framework would define how CAPE tools would deal with common services, interact with each other and coordinate problem solving activities. Although some existing software products and standards currently address the common services issue, the problem of tool interaction remains largely unsolved. The problem of tool interaction is not limited to the domain of computer-aided manufacturing systems engineering—it is pervasive across the software industry.{{ref|techc}}

==CAPE's current state==

An initial CAPE environment has been established from [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) software packages. This new environment is being used to demonstrate commercially available tools to perform CAPE functions, to develop a better understanding and define functional requirements for individual engineering tools and the overall environment, and to identify the integration issues which must be addressed to implement compatible environments in the future.

Several engineering demonstrations using COTS tools are under development. These demonstrations are designed to illustrate the various types of functions that must be performed in engineering a manufacturing system.

Functions supported by the current COTS environment include: system specification/diagramming,
process [[flowchart]]ing, information [[computer model|modeling]], computer-aided design of products, plant layout, [[material flow analysis]], ergonomic workplace design, mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, line balancing, manufacturing simulation, investment analysis, project management, knowledge-based system development, spreadsheets, document preparation, user interface development, document illustration, forms and database management.{{ref|curr}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2950">'''DREAD''' is part of a system for risk-assessing [[computer security]] [[Threat (computer)|threats]] previously used at Microsoft and  although currently used by OpenStack and other corporations{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} it was abandoned by its creators &lt;ref&gt;[https://adam.shostack.org/modsec08/Shostack-ModSec08-Experiences-Threat-Modeling-At-Microsoft.pdf Experiences Threat Modeling at Microsoft, Adam Shostack]&lt;/ref&gt;.  It provides a [[mnemonic]] for risk rating security threats using five categories.

The categories are:

* '''D'''amage – how bad would an attack be?
* '''R'''eproducibility – how easy is it to reproduce the attack?
* '''E'''xploitability – how much work is it to launch the attack?
* '''A'''ffected users – how many people will be impacted?
* '''D'''iscoverability – how easy is it to discover the threat?

The DREAD name comes from the initials of the five categories listed. It was initially proposed for [[threat model]]ing, but it was discovered that the ratings are not very consistent and are subject to debate.  It was out of use at Microsoft by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/c601e0ca-5f38-4a07-8a46-40e4adcbc293/do-you-use-dread-as-it-is?forum=sdlprocess ''Do you use DREAD as it is?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

When a given threat is assessed using DREAD, each category is given a rating from 1 to 10.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/OSSA-Metrics#DREAD OpenStack Security OSSA/Metrics DREAD&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling#DREAD OWASP Threat Risk Modeling: DREAD&lt;/ref&gt; The sum of all ratings for a given issue can be used to prioritize among different issues.

==Discoverability debate==

Some security experts feel that including the "Discoverability" element as the last D rewards [[security through obscurity]], so some organizations have either moved to a DREAD-D "DREAD minus D" scale (which omits Discoverability) or always assume that Discoverability is at its maximum rating.&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/OSSA-Metrics#Calibration OpenStack Security OSSA/Metrics DREAD Calibration: "Discoverability always assumed to be 10"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Threat_Risk_Modeling#DREAD OWASP Threat Risk Modeling: DREAD: "Discoverability will often be set to 10 by convention"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diamond Light Source''' (''"Diamond"'') is the UK's national [[synchrotron]] science facility located at the [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] in [[Oxfordshire]]. Its purpose is to produce [[synchrotron light|intense beams of light]] whose special characteristics are useful in many areas of scientific research. In particular it can be used to investigate the structure and properties of a wide range of materials from [[proteins]] (to provide information for designing new and better drugs), and engineering components (such as a fan blade from an aero-engine&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/02_12_10.html Diamond and Rolls-Royce shine light on world’s biggest synchrotron stage]&lt;/ref&gt;) to conservation of archeological artifacts (for example [[Henry VIII]]'s flagship the [[Mary Rose]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/7February2008.html High-tech conservation solutions for old warship – Diamond Lights Source]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nakeddiscovery.com/downloads/split_individual/09.10.29/Naked_Scientists_Show_09.10.29_4852.mp3 Podcast – Dr Mark Jones from The Mary Rose Trust discusses his research]&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Design, construction and finance ==
[[File:Diamond Light Source building - 3338870 ff7a8854.jpg|thumb|300px|The Diamond Light Source building]]
Following early work during the 1990s, a final design study was completed in 2001 (the so-called '[https://epubs.stfc.ac.uk/work/25071633 Green Book]') by scientists at [[Daresbury Laboratory]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond10.org/timeline/2002-3/] DIAMOND Light Source, 10th Anniversary Blog&lt;/ref&gt; construction then began following the creation of the operating company, DIAMOND Light Source Ltd.

Diamond was built at [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] near [[Didcot]] in [[Oxfordshire]], UK, next to the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] operated by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC)]]. It produced its first user beam towards the end of January 2007, and was formally opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] on 19 October 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Media/LatestNews/October2007.html Diamond News: Her Majesty The Queen Officially Opens Diamond Light Source]&lt;/ref&gt;

The facility is operated by Diamond Light Source Ltd,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/About/Company.html Diamond Light Source Ltd] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707191907/http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/About/Company.html |date=2013-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[joint venture]] company established in March 2002. The company receives 86% of its funding from the UK Government (via the STFC) and 14% from the [[Wellcome Trust]]. Diamond cost £260m to build which covered the cost of the synchrotron building, the accelerators inside it, the first seven experimental stations (beamlines) and the adjacent office block, Diamond House. [[Costain Group|Costain Ltd]] constructed the building and the synchrotron hall.
Significant construction achievements to note:

i) The project was completed on time and on budget;

ii) The construction of Diamond was completed with one of the lowest accident rates of a mega project ever completed in the UK. Over 1.4 million [[person-hour]]s were completed during the peak of construction without a single recordable accident.

== The synchrotron ==
Diamond generates [[synchrotron light]] at wavelengths ranging from [[X-rays]] to the [[infrared#Different regions in the infrared|far infrared]]. This is also known as [[synchrotron radiation]] and is the [[electromagnetic radiation]] emitted by charged particles travelling near the [[speed of light]]. It is used in a huge variety of experiments to study the structure and behaviour of many different types of matter.

The particles Diamond uses are [[electron]]s travelling at an energy of 3 [[electronvolt|GeV]] &lt;ref&gt;Equivalent to accelerating them through a voltage of 3 billion Volts; 1 electronvolt is the energy an electron gains when accelerated by a potential difference of 1 Volt.&lt;/ref&gt; round a 561.6 m circumference [[storage ring]]. The ring is not circular, but is shaped as a forty-eight-sided polygon, using a 'double bend achromat' magnet configuration in which two bending magnets are placed in each of 24 cells. As the electrons pass through specially designed magnets at each vertex, their sudden change of direction causes them to emit an exceptionally bright beam of electro-magnetic radiation. This is the synchrotron light used for experiments.

The electrons reach this high energy via a series of pre-accelerator stages before being injected into the 3 GeV storage ring:
* an [[electron gun]] – 90&amp;nbsp;keV
* a 100&amp;nbsp;MeV [[linear accelerator]]
* a 100&amp;nbsp;MeV – 3&amp;nbsp;GeV booster synchrotron (158&amp;nbsp;m in circumference).

The Diamond synchrotron is housed in a silver [[Toroid (geometry)|toroidal]] building of 738m in circumference, covering an area in excess of 43,300 square metres, or the area of over six [[Association football pitch|football pitches]]. This contains the [[storage ring]] and a number of [[beamline]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Beamlines.html Current list of Diamond Beamlines]&lt;/ref&gt; with the linear accelerator and booster synchrotron housed in the centre of the ring. These beamlines are the experimental stations where the synchrotron light's interaction with matter is used for research purposes.  Seven (Phase I) beamlines were available when Diamond became operational in 2007, with  another fifteen (Phase II) completed over the period 2007–2012. As of January 2013 there were 22 in operation. The Government and the Wellcome Trust have now agreed to fund Phase III of Diamond which will increase the number of operational beamlines to 32 by 2017.

The seven beamlines which were available when Diamond first became operational in January 2007 were:
* extreme conditions beamline for studying materials under intense temperatures and pressures (Beamline I15).
* materials and magnetism beamline, set up to probe electronic and magnetic materials at the atomic level (Beamline I16).
* three [[macromolecule|macromolecular]] [[crystallography]] beamlines, for decoding the structure of complex biological samples, such as [[protein]]s (Beamlines I02, I03 and I04).
* microfocus spectroscopy beamline, able to map the chemical make up of complex materials such as [[moon rocks]] and geological samples (Beamline I18).
* [[nanoscience]] beamline, capable of imaging structures and devices at the scale of a few nanometres (millionths of a millimetre) (Beamline I06).

Phase III of Diamond provides for the design, procurement, construction and commissioning of an additional 10 beamlines to complement those in Phases I and II of Diamond. They will become operational over the period 2013–2017/18.

Diamond is intended ultimately to host up to ~ forty beamlines, supporting the life, physical and environmental sciences.

In 2015, Diamond began the electron Bio-Imaging Centre (eBIC), a UK national facility providing instruments and expertise in the field of [[cryo-electron microscopy]]. Initially, one FEI Titan Krios microscope I was housed in the experimental hall at Diamond. In September 2018, Dr. [[Richard Henderson (biologist)]], the 2017 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, officially opened eBICs own dedicated facility. Housing four dedicated FEI cryo-electron microscopes for academia as well as two new cryo-electron microscopes and professional cryo-EM services designed exclusively for the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.selectscience.net/editorial-articles/nobel-prize-winner-in-chemistry-talks-cryo-em-and-its-impact-on-drug?artID=47351&lt;/ref&gt;  Experimental techniques available at this facility include single particle analysis of biological macromolecules, cellular tomography and electron crystallography.

== Case studies ==
* On 13 September 2007, scientists from [[Cardiff University]], led by Professor Tim Wess, found that the Diamond synchrotron could be used to discover hidden content of ancient documents by [[Lighting|illumination]] without opening them (penetrating layers of [[parchment]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6991893.stm  BBC NEWS, 'Super-scope' to see hidden texts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diamond.ac.uk/Home/Beamlines/small-angle/Case-Studies/casestudy3.html Diamond: Unravelling the secrets of ancient parchments]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Diamond is a UK National Facility that aims at providing researchers from the UK and the world with synchrotron-based techniques for a wide range of scientific applications.

The name DIAMOND was originally conceived by Mike Poole (the originator of the DIAMOND project) and stood as an acronym meaning '''DI'''pole '''A'''nd '''M'''ultipole '''O'''utput for the '''N'''ation at [[Daresbury Laboratory|'''D'''aresbury]].  With the location of Diamond now being in Oxfordshire, the explanation has been changed, and now derives from that the fact that the light from the synchrotron is both 'hard' (referring to the "hard" X-ray region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]) and bright, and hence the current name "Diamond" was born).&lt;ref&gt;Private Communications with Prof [[Gerhard Materlik|Gerd Materlik]], CEO of Diamond, and with Mike Poole&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond is located on the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]] [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]] site, near to the [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS Neutron and Muon Source]], the Central Laser Facility, and the nearby laboratories at Harwell and Culham (including the [[Joint European Torus]] (JET) project). Diamond was originally due to replace the second-generation synchrotron at Daresbury in Cheshire, however, it was decided to locate the new British synchrotron in Oxfordshire.

The Diamond synchrotron is the largest UK-funded scientific facility to be built in the UK for over 45 years, since the Nimrod proton synchrotron which was sited at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. In 1977 financial approval was given to convert the Nimrod facility into the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) named [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS]].

There are approximately 70&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightsources.org/cms/?pid=1000098 ''Lightsources.org'': List of world Synchrotron (Light Source) Facilities]&lt;/ref&gt; ''dedicated'' synchrotron facilities in the world, and Diamond (3&amp;nbsp;GeV) is the world's largest ''medium energy'' synchrotron. Only four dedicated synchrotron facilities in the world are currently larger than Diamond, and all are ''high energy'' machines. These are: i) [[SPring-8]] in Japan (8&amp;nbsp;GeV); ii) The [[European Synchrotron Radiation Facility]] in Grenoble, France (6.03&amp;nbsp;GeV); iii) The [[Advanced Photon Source]] (APS) in Chicago, USA (7&amp;nbsp;GeV); iv) [[DESY]]'s PETRA III (6&amp;nbsp;GeV) in Germany, which is currently the world's largest dedicated synchrotron source.

These epoxygenases can metabolize EPA to as many as 10 epoxides that differ in the site and/or stereoisomer of the epoxide formed; however, the formed EEQs, while differing in potency, often have similar bioactivities and are commonly considered together.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18952572 | pmc = 2674692 | year = 2009 | author1 = Spector | first1 = A.

==Structure==
EPA is a straight-chain, 20 carbon [[omega-3 fatty acid]] containing cis (see [[Cis–trans isomerism]]) double bounds between carbons 5 and 6, 8 and 9, 11 and 12, 14 and 15, and 17 and 18; each of these double bonds is designated with the notation ''Z'' to indicate its cis configuration in the IUPAC [[Chemical nomenclature]] used here. EPA is therefore 5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosapentaenoic acid. Certain cytochrome P450 epoxygenases metabolize EPA by converting one of these double bounds to an epoxide thereby forming one of 5 possible eicosatetraenoic acid epoxide regioisomers (see [[Structural isomer]], section on position isomerism (regioisomerism)). These regioisomers are: 5,6-EEQ (i.e. 5,6-epoxy-8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), 8,9-EEQ (i.e. 8,9-epoxy-5''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), 11,12-EEQ (i.e. 11,12-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',14''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid), 14,15-EEQ (i.e. 14,15-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',17''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid, and 17,18-EEQ (i.e. 17,18-epoxy-5''Z'',8''Z'',11''Z'',14''Z''-eicosatetraenoic acid. The epoxydases typically make both ''R''/''S'' [[enantiomers]] of each epoxide.  For example, they metabolize EPA at its 17,18 double bond to a mixture of 17''R'',18''S''-EEQ and 17''S'',18''R''-EEQ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 24345640 | pmc = 3914417 | year = 2014 | author1 = Zhang | first1 = G | title = Stabilized epoxygenated fatty acids regulate inflammation, pain, angiogenesis and cancer | journal = Progress in Lipid Research | volume = 53 | pages = 108–23 | last2 = Kodani | first2 = S | last3 = Hammock | first3 = B.

==Production==
Cellular cytochrome P450 epoxygenases metabolize various [[polyunsaturated fatty acid]]s to epoxide-containng products. They metabolize the omega-6 fatty acids [[arachidonic acid]], which possess four double bonds, to 8 different epoxide isomers which are termed [[epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]s or EETs and [[linoleic acid]], which possess two double bonds, to 4 different epoxide isomers, i.e. two different 9,10-epoxide isomers termed [[vernolic acid]]s or leukotoxins and two different 12,13-epoxides isomers termed [[coronaric acid]]s or isoleukotoxins. They metabolize the [[omega-3 fatty acid]], [[docosahexaenoic acid]], which possesses 6 double bonds, to 12 different [[epoxydocosapentaenoic acid]] (EDPs) isomers. In general, the same epoxygenases that accomplish these metabolic conversions also metabolize the omega-6 fatty acid, EPA, to 10 epoxide isomers, the EEQs.  These epoxygenases fall into several subfamilies including the cytochrome P4501A (i.e.CYP1A), CYP2B, CYP2C, CYP2E, and CYP2J subfamilies, and within the CYP3A subfamily, CYP3A4. In humans, [[CYP1A1]], [[CYP1A2]], [[CYP2C8]], [[CYP2C9]], [[CYP2C18]], [[CYP2C19]], [[CYP2E1]], [[CYP2J2]], [[CYP3A4]], and [[CYP2S1]] metabolize EPA to EEQs, in most cases forming principally 17,18-EEQ with smaller amounts of 5,6-EEQ, 8,9-EEQ, 11,12-EEQ, and 14,15-EEQ isomers.&lt;ref name="Arch Biochem Biophys 2008"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18206980 | year = 2008 | author1 = Fer | first1 = M | title = Metabolism of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids by recombinant human cytochromes P450 | journal = Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics | volume = 471 | issue = 2 | pages = 116–25 | last2 = Dréano | first2 = Y | last3 = Lucas | first3 = D | last4 = Corcos | first4 = L | last5 = Salaün | first5 = J.

The EEQ-forming cytochromes are widely distributed in the tissues of humans and other mammals, including blood vessel endothelium, blood vessel [[atheroma]] placques, heart muscle, kidneys, pancreas, intestine, lung, brain, [[monocyte]]s, and [[macrophage]]s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25655310 | pmc = 4500322 | year = 2015 | author1 = Yang | first1 = L | title = The role of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids in the cardiovascular system | journal = British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology | volume = 80 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–44 | last2 = Mäki-Petäjä | first2 = K | last3 = Cheriyan | first3 = J | last4 = McEniery | first4 = C | last5 = Wilkinson | first5 = I.

==EEQ metabolism==
In cells, EEQs are rapidly metabolized by the same enzyme that similarly metabolizes other epoxy fatty acids including the EETs viz., cytosolic [[soluble epoxide hydrolase]] [EC 3.2.2.10.] (also termed sEH or the EPHX2), to form their corresponding [[Vicinal (chemistry)]] [[diol]] dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (diHETEs). The omega-3 fatty acid epoxides, EEQs and EPAs, appear to be preferred over EETs as substates for sEH.&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt; sEH converts 17,18-EEQ isomers to 17,18-dihydroxy-eicosatrienoic acid isomers (17,18-diHETEs), 14,15-EEQ isomers to 14,15-diHETE isomers, 11,12-EEQ isomers to 11,12-diHETE isomers, 8,9-EEQ isomers to 8,9-diHETE isomers, and 5,6-EEQ isomers to 5,6-diHETE isomers.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23701967 | pmc = 3733540 | year = 2013 | author1 = Harris | first1 = T.

D. | doi = 10.1016/j.gene.2013.05.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The product diHETEs, like their epoxy precursors, are [[enantiomer]] mixtures; for instance, sEH converts 17,18-EEQ to a mixture of 17(''S''),19(''R'')-diHETE and  17(''R''),18(''S'')-diHETE.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  Since the diHETE products are as a rule generally far less active than their epoxide precursors, the sEH pathway of EET metabolism is regarded as a critical EEQ-inactivating pathway.&lt;ref name="Gene p 10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 23011468 | year = 2013 | author1 = Bellien | first1 = J | title = Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid pathway in human health and diseases | journal = Journal of Cardiovascular Pharmacology | volume = 61 | issue = 3 | pages = 188–96 | last2 = Joannides | first2 = R | doi = 10.1097/FJC.0b013e318273b007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 20869469 | year = 2011 | author1 = Konkel | first1 = A | title = Role of cytochrome P450 enzymes in the bioactivation of polyunsaturated fatty acids | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA) - Proteins and Proteomics | volume = 1814 | issue = 1 | pages = 210–22 | last2 = Schunck | first2 = W. H. | doi = 10.1016/j.bbapap.2010.09.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Membrane-bound [[Microsomal epoxide hydrolase]] (mEH or Epoxide hydrolase 2 [EC 3.2.2.9.]) can metabolize EEQs to their dihydroxy products but is regarded as not contributing significantly to EEQ inactivation in vivo except possibly in rare tissues where the sEH level is exceptionally low while the mEH level is high.&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25240260 | pmc = 4254344 | year = 2014 | author1 = Wagner | first1 = K | title = The role of long chain fatty acids and their epoxide metabolites in nociceptive signaling | journal = Prostaglandins &amp; Other Lipid Mediators | volume = 113-115 | pages = 2–12 | last2 = Vito | first2 = S | last3 = Inceoglu | first3 = B | last4 = Hammock | first4 = B.

In addition to the sEH pathway, EETs may be acylated into phospholipids in an [[Acylation]]-like reaction.  This pathway may serve to limit the action of EETs or store them for future release.&lt;ref name="Biochim Biophys Acta 2014"/&gt;  EETs are also inactivated by being further metabolized though three other pathways: [[Beta oxidation]], [[Omega oxidation]], and elongation by enzymes involved in [[Fatty acid synthesis]].&lt;ref name="Prostaglandins Other Lipid Mediat 2014. p 18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 22848834 | pmc = 3405717 | year = 2012 | author1 = Thomson | first1 = S.

==Clinical significance==
EEQS, similar to EDPs, have not be studied nearly as well as the EETs.  In comparison to the many activities attributed to the EETs in animal model studies (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid]]), a limited set of studies indicate that EEQs (and EPAs) mimic EETS in their abilities to dilate arterioles, reduce hypertension, inhibit inflammation (the anti-inflammatory actions of EEQ are less potent than those of the EETs) and thereby reduce occlusion of arteries to protect the heart and prevent and [[stroke]]s (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance]] sections on '''a)''' Regulation of blood pressure, '''b)''' Heart disease, '''c)''' Strokes and seizures, and '''d)''' inflammation); they also mimic EETs in possessing [[analgesia]] properties in relieving certain types of pain (see [[Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid#Clinical significance#Pain]]).&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt;  Often, the EEQs (and EPAs) exhibit greater potency and/or effectiveness than EET in these actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 25244930 | year = 2014 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The pharmacology of the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase/soluble epoxide hydrolase axis in the vasculature and cardiovascular disease | journal = Pharmacological Reviews | volume = 66 | issue = 4 | pages = 1106–40 | doi = 10.1124/pr.113.007781 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antioxid Redox Signal 2014"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26975734 | year = 2016 | author1 = Fleming | first1 = I | title = The factor in EDHF: Cytochrome P450 derived lipid mediators and vascular signaling | journal = Vascular Pharmacology | doi = 10.1016/j.vph.2016.03.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In human studies potentially relevant to one or more of these activities, consumption of long chain omega-3 fatty acid (i.e. EPA- and DHA-rich) diet produced significant reductions in systolic blood pressure and increased peripheral arteriole blood flow and reactivity in patients at high to intermediate risk for cardiovascular events; an EPA/DHA-rich diet also reduced the risk while high serum levels of DHA and EPA were associated with a low risk of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18689376 | year = 2008 | author1 = Augood | first1 = C | title = Oily fish consumption, dietary docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid intakes, and associations with neovascular age-related macular degeneration | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 88 | issue = 2 | pages = 398–406 | last2 = Chakravarthy | first2 = U | last3 = Young | first3 = I | last4 = Vioque | first4 = J | last5 = De Jong | first5 = P.

'''Forensic materials engineering''', a branch of [[forensic engineering]], focuses on the material evidence from crime or accident scenes, seeking  defects in those materials which might explain why an accident occurred, or the source of a specific material to identify a criminal. Many analytical methods used for material identification may be used in investigations, the exact set being determined by the nature of the material in question, be it [[metal]], [[glass]], [[ceramic]], [[polymer]] or [[composite material|composite]]. An important aspect is the analysis of [[trace evidence]] such as [[skid mark]]s on exposed surfaces, where contact between dissimilar materials leaves material traces of one left on the other. Provided the traces can be analysed successfully, then an accident or crime can often be reconstructed. Another aim will be to determine the cause of a broken component using the technique of [[fractography]].

==Metals and alloys==
[[Image:Crankshaft fatigue.jpg|thumbnail|200px|left|[[Crankshaft]] [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] fracture]]
Metal and alloy surfaces can be analyzed in a number of ways, including by [[spectroscopy]] and [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|EDX]] used during [[scanning electron microscopy]]. The nature and composition of the metal can normally be established by sectioning and polishing the bulk, and examining the flat section using [[optical microscopy]] after [[etching]] solutions have been used to provide contrast in the section between alloy constituents. Such solutions (often an [[acid]]) attack the surface preferentially, so isolating features or inclusions of one composition, enabling them to be seen much more clearly than in the polished but untreated surface. [[Metallography]] is a routine technique for examining the [[microstructure]] of metals, but can also be applied to ceramics, glasses and polymers. [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] can often be critical in  determining failures modes by examining fracture surfaces. The origin of a crack can be found and the way it grew assessed, to distinguish, for example, [[Mechanical overload (engineering)|overload]] failure from [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]]. Often however, fatigue fractures are easy to distinguish from overload failures by the lack of ductility, and the existence of a fast crack growth region and the slow crack growth area on the fracture surface. [[Crankshaft]] fatigue for example is a common failure mode for engine parts. The example shows just two such zones, the slow crack at the base, the fast at the top.

==Ceramics and glasses==
[[Image:Glass fracture.jpg|left|thumb|200px| Brittle fracture in [[glass]]]]
Hard products like [[ceramic]] pottery and [[glass]] [[windscreen]]s can be studied using the same [[Scanning electron microscope|SEM]] methods used for metals, especially [[ESEM]] conducted at low vacuum. Fracture surfaces are especially valuable sources of information because surface features like hachures can enable the origin or origins of the cracks to be found. Analysis of the surface features is carried out using [[fractography]].

The position of the origin can then be matched with likely loads on the product to show how an accident occurred, for example. Inspection of bullet holes can often show the direction of travel and energy of the impact, and the way common glass products like bottles can be analysed to show whether deliberately or accidentally broken in a crime or accident. Defects such as foreign particles will often occur near or at the origin of the critical crack, and can be readily identified by [[ESEM]].

==Polymers and composites==
[[Image:Chlorine attack1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[chlorine]] attack of [[acetal resin]] plumbing joint]]
[[Thermoplastics]], [[thermosets]], and [[Composite material|composites]] can be analyzed using [[FTIR]] and [[UV spectroscopy]] as well as [[NMR]] and [[ESEM]]. Failed samples can either be dissolved in a suitable solvent and examined directly (UV, IR and NMR sepctroscopy) or as a thin film cast from solvent or cut using [[microtomy]] from the solid product. The slicing method is preferable since there are no complications from solvent absorption, and the integrity of the sample is partly preserved. Fractured products can be examined using [[fractography]], an especially useful method for all fractured components using [[macrophotography]] and [[optical microscopy]]. Although polymers usually possess quite different properties to metals and ceramics, they are just as susceptible to failure from [[mechanical overload (engineering)|mechanical overload]], [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] and [[stress corrosion cracking]] if products are poorly designed or manufactured. Many plastics are susceptible to attack by active chemicals like [[chlorine]], present at low levels in potable water supplies, especially if the [[injection moulding]]s are faulty.

[[ESEM]] is especially useful for providing [[elemental analysis]] from viewed parts of the sample being investigated. It is effectively a technique of [[microanalysis]] and valuable for examination of [[trace evidence]]. On the other hand, colour rendition is absent, and there is no information provided about the way in which those elements are bonded to one another. Specimens will be exposed to a vacuum, so any volatiles may be removed, and surfaces may be contaminated by substances used to attach the sample to the mount.

==Elastomers==
[[Image:Ozone cracks in tube1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Ozone cracking in [[Natural rubber]] tubing]]
Rubber products are often safety-critical parts of machines, so that failure can often cause accidents or loss of function. Failed products can be examined with many of the generic polymer methods, although it is more difficult if the sample is [[vulcanized]] or [[cross-linked]]. [[Attenuated total reflectance]] [[infra-red spectroscopy]] is useful because the product is usually flexible so can be pressed against the [[selenium]] crystal used for analysis. Simple swelling tests can also help to identify the specific [[elastomer]] used in a product. Often the best technique is [[ESEM]] using the X-ray elemental analysis facility on the microscope. Although the method only provides [[elemental analysis]], it can provide clues as to the identity of the elastomer being examined. Thus the presence of substantial amounts of [[chlorine]] indicates [[polychloroprene]] while the presence of [[nitrogen]] indicates [[nitrile rubber]]. The method is also useful in confirming [[ozone cracking]] by the large amounts of [[oxygen]] present on cracked surfaces. Ozone attacks susceptible elastomers such as [[natural rubber]], [[nitrile rubber]] and [[polybutadiene]] and associated [[copolymer]]s. Such elastomers possess double bonds in their main chains, the group which is attacked during [[ozonolysis]].

The problem occurs when small concentrations of [[ozone]] gas are present near to exposed elastomer surfaces, such as [[O-ring]]s and [[diaphragm seal]]s. The product must be in tension, but only very low strains are sufficient to cause degradation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1953">'''Fuzzy Control Language''', or '''FCL''', is a language for implementing [[fuzzy logic]], especially [[fuzzy control]]. It was standardized by IEC 61131-7. It is a [[domain-specific programming language]]: it has no features unrelated to fuzzy logic, so it is impossible to even print "[[Hello world program|Hello, world!]]". Therefore, one does not write a program in FCL, but one may write ''part'' of it in FCL.

== Example ==

 RULE 0: IF (Temperature IS Cold) THEN (Output IS High)

== Limitations ==

FCL is not an entirely complete fuzzy language, for instance, it does not support "hedges", which are adverbs that modify the set. For instance, the programmer cannot write:

 RULE 0: IF (Temperature IS VERY Cold) THEN (Output IS VERY High)

However, the programmer can simply define new sets for "very cold" and "very high". FCL also lacks support for higher-order fuzzy sets, subsets, and so on. None of these features are essential to fuzzy control, although they may be nice to have.

The '''history of science and technology''' ('''HST''') is a field of [[history]] which examines how humanity's understanding of the natural world (science) and ability to manipulate it ([[technology]]) have changed over the centuries.  This academic discipline also studies the cultural, economic, and political impacts of scientific innovation.

[[Historiography of science|Histories of science]] were originally written by practicing and retired scientists, starting primarily with [[William Whewell]], as a way to communicate the virtues of science to the public. In the early 1930s, after a famous paper given by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] historian [[Boris Hessen]], was focused into looking at the ways in which scientific practices were allied with the needs and motivations of their context. After [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], extensive resources were put into teaching and researching the discipline, with the hopes that it would help the public better understand both Science and Technology as they came to play an exceedingly prominent role in the world. In the 1960s, especially in the wake of the work done by [[Thomas Kuhn]], the discipline began to serve a very different function, and began to be used as a way to critically examine the scientific enterprise. At the present time it is often closely aligned with the field of [[science studies]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Modern engineering as it is understood today took form during the [[scientific revolution]], though much of the mathematics and science was built on the work of the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[History of science and technology in China|Chinese]], [[Science and technology in ancient India|Indians]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} See the main articles [[History of science]] and [[History of technology]] for these respective topics.

=== United States ===
Academic study of the History of Science as an independent discipline was launched by [[George Sarton]] at Harvard with his book ''Introduction to the History of Science'' (1927) and the [[Isis (journal)|''Isis'' journal]] (founded in 1912).  Sarton exemplified the early 20th century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas. He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress. The History of Science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period, and most of the work was carried out by interested Scientists and Physicians rather than professional Historians.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan Reingold, "History of Science Today, 1. Uniformity as Hidden Diversity: History of Science in the United States, 1920-1940," ''British Journal for the History of Science'' 1986 19(3): 243-262&lt;/ref&gt;  With the work of [[I. Bernard Cohen]] at Harvard, the history of Science became an established subdiscipline of history after 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Dauben | first1= JW | last2= Gleason | first2= ML | last3= Smith | first3= GE | title= Seven decades of history of science: I.

{{History of computing}}
From its beginnings in the 1960s, writing [[software]] has evolved into a profession concerned with how best to maximize the quality of software and of how to create it. Quality can refer to how maintainable software is, to its stability, speed, usability, testability, readability, size, cost, security, and number of flaws or "bugs", as well as to less measurable qualities like elegance, conciseness, and customer satisfaction, among many other attributes. How best to create high quality software is a separate and controversial problem covering software design principles, so-called "best practices" for writing code, as well as broader management issues such as optimal team size, process, how best to deliver software on time and as quickly as possible, work-place "culture", hiring practices, and so forth. All this falls under the broad rubric of [[software engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://learn.saylor.org/mod/page/view.php?id=12353|title=CS302: Jared King's "The History of Software"|website=learn.saylor.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The evolution of software engineering is notable in a number of areas:
* Emergence as a profession: By the early 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;"Software engineering … has recently emerged as a discipline in its own right."
{{cite book

 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[software engineering had already emerged as a ''bona fide'' profession|software engineering professionalism]], to stand beside computer science and traditional engineering.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
* [[Women, girls and information technology|Role of women]]: Before 1970 men filling the more prestigious and better paying [[hardware engineering]] roles often delegated the writing of software to women, and legends such as [[Grace Hopper]] or [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret Hamilton]] filled many [[computer programming]] jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Recoding Gender|last=Abbate|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0262534536|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Computer Boys Take Over|last=Ensmenger|first=Nathan|publisher=MIT Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0262517966|location=Cambridge, MA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Today, fewer women work in software engineering than in other professions, a situation whose cause is not clearly identified. Many academic and professional organizations {{Who|date=February 2015}} consider this situation unbalanced and are trying hard to solve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/17/356944145/episode-576-when-women-stopped-coding|title=Episode 576: When Women Stopped Coding|last=|first=|date=Oct 17, 2014|website=NPR Planet Money|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=June 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Processes: [[Software development process|Processes]] have become a big part of software engineering and are hailed for their potential to improve software and sharply criticized for their potential to constrict programmers.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
* Cost of hardware: The relative cost of software versus hardware has changed substantially over the last 50 years. When [[Mainframe computer|mainframes]] were expensive and required large support staffs, the few organizations buying them also had the resources to fund large, expensive custom software engineering projects. Computers are now much more numerous and much more powerful, which has several effects on software. The larger market can support large projects to create [[commercial off the shelf]] software, as done by companies such as [[Microsoft]]. The cheap machines allow each programmer to have a terminal capable of fairly rapid [[Compiler|compilation]]. The programs in question can use techniques such as [[garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]], which make them easier and faster for the programmer to write. On the other hand, many fewer organizations are interested in employing programmers for large custom software projects, instead using [[commercial off the shelf]] software as much as possible.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== 1945 to 1965: The origins ==
Putative origins for the term ''software engineering'' include a 1965 letter from ACM president [[Anthony Oettinger]],&lt;ref name="nato-68-or-acm-66"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://bertrandmeyer.com/2013/04/04/the-origin-of-software-engineering/|title=The origin of &amp;#8220;software engineering&amp;#8221;|last=Meyer|authorlink=Bertrand Meyer |first=Bertrand|date=April 4, 2013|accessdate=2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tadre|first=Matti|title=The Science of Computing|page=121|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4822-1770-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  lectures by [[Douglas T. Ross]] at MIT in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mahoney|first=Michael|title=The Roots of Software Engineering|journal=CWI Quarterly|volume=3|issue=4|pages=325–334|url=http://thecorememory.com/TROSE.pdf|accessdate=Jun 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret H.

The [[NATO Science for Peace and Security|NATO Science Committee]] sponsored two conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepages.cs.ncl.ac.uk/brian.randell/NATO/|title=NATO Software Engineering Conferences|author=Brian Randell|authorlink=Brian Randell|date=2001|publisher=ncl.ac.uk|accessdate =2016-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; on software engineering in 1968 (Garmisch, Germany&amp;nbsp;— see ''[[List of publications in computer science#Software engineering: Report of a conference sponsored by the NATO Science Committee|conference report]]'') and 1969, which gave the field its initial boost. Many believe these conferences marked the official start of the profession of ''software engineering''.&lt;ref name="nato-68-or-acm-66" /&gt;&lt;ref name="jared"&gt;{{cite web |last=King |first=Jared |title= Jared King's &amp;#8220;The History of Software&amp;#8221; |url= https://learn.saylor.org/mod/page/view.php?id=12353 |date=2016 |publisher=[[Saylor Foundation|Saylor.org]] |work=CS302: Software Engineering |accessdate=2016-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1965 to 1985: The software crisis ==
Software engineering was spurred by the so-called ''[[software crisis]]'' of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s, which identified many of the problems of software development. Many projects ran over budget and schedule. Some projects caused property damage. A few projects caused loss of life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Therac-25]]&lt;/ref&gt; The software crisis was originally defined in terms of [[productivity]], but evolved to emphasize [[Software quality assurance|quality]]. Some used the term ''software crisis'' to refer to their inability to hire enough qualified programmers.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
* Cost and [[budget overrun|Budget Overruns]]: The [[OS/360]] operating system was a classic example. This decade-long project from the 1960s eventually produced one of the most complex software systems at the time.&lt;ref name="jared" /&gt; OS/360 was one of the first large (1000 programmers{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}) software projects. [[Fred Brooks]] claims in ''[[The Mythical Man-Month]]'' that he made a multimillion-dollar mistake of not developing a coherent [[Software architecture|architecture]] before starting development.&lt;ref name="jared" /&gt;
* Property Damage: Software defects can cause property damage. Poor [[software security]] allows hackers to steal identities, costing time, money, and reputations.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
* Life and Death: Software defects can kill. Some [[embedded systems]] used in [[radiotherapy]] machines failed so catastrophically that they administered [[lethal dose]]s of [[radiation]] to patients.  The most famous of these failures is the ''[[Therac-25]]'' incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An investigation of the Therac-25 accidents|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=274940|journal = Computer|date = 1993-07-01|issn = 0018-9162|pages = 18–41|volume = 26|issue = 7|doi = 10.1109/MC.1993.274940|first = N.G.|last = Leveson|first2 = C.S.|last2 = Turner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter G. Neumann]] has kept a contemporary list of software problems and disasters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks|title=RISKS-LIST: RISKS-FORUM Digest|work=The Risks Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt; The software crisis has been fading from view, because it is psychologically extremely difficult to remain in crisis mode for a protracted period (more than 20 years). Nevertheless, software – especially real-time embedded software – remains risky and is pervasive, and it is crucial not to give in to complacency. Over the last 10–15 years [[Michael A. Jackson]] has written extensively about the nature of software engineering, has identified the main source of its difficulties as lack of specialization, and has suggested that his problem frames provide the basis for a "normal practice" of software engineering, a prerequisite if software engineering is to become an engineering science.&lt;ref&gt;{Michael Jackson, "Engineering and Software Engineering" in S Nanz ed, The Future of Software Engineering, Springer Verlag 2010; Michael Jackson, Problem Frames: Analyzing and Structuring Software Development Problems; Addison-Wesley, 2001}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1985 to 1989: "''No Silver Bullet''" ==
For decades, solving the software crisis was paramount to researchers and companies producing software tools.
The cost of owning and maintaining software in the 1980s was twice as expensive as developing the software.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
* During the 1990s, the cost of ownership and maintenance increased by 30% over the 1980s.
* In 1995, statistics showed that half of surveyed development projects were operational, but were not considered successful.
* The average software project overshoots its schedule by half.
* Three-quarters of all large software products delivered to the customer are failures that are either not used at all, or do not meet the customer's requirements.

=== Software projects ===
Seemingly, every new technology and practice from the 1970s through the 1990s was trumpeted as a ''[[silver bullet]]'' to solve the software crisis. Tools, discipline, [[formal methods]], process, and professionalism were touted as silver bullets:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

* Tools: Especially emphasized were tools: [[structured programming]], [[object-oriented programming]], [[Computer-aided software engineering|CASE]] tools such as ICL's [[CADES]] CASE system,&lt;ref&gt;D.J.Pearson "The use and abuse of a software engineering system" National Computer Conference 1979&lt;/ref&gt;[[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[documentation]], and [[standardization|standards]] were touted as silver bullets.

* Discipline: Some pundits argued that the software crisis was due to the lack of discipline of programmers.

* Formal methods: Some believed that if formal engineering methodologies would be applied to software development, then production of software would become as predictable an industry as other branches of engineering. They advocated proving all programs correct.

* Process: Many advocated the use of defined processes and [[Methodology (software engineering)|methodologies]] like the [[Capability Maturity Model]].

* Professionalism: This led to work on a code of ethics, licenses, and professionalism.

In 1986, [[Fred Brooks]] published his ''[[No Silver Bullet]]'' article, arguing that no individual technology or practice would ever make a 10-fold improvement in productivity within 10 years.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Debate about silver bullets raged over the following decade. Advocates for [[Ada programming language|Ada]], [[software componentry|components]], and processes continued arguing for years that their favorite technology would be a silver bullet. Skeptics disagreed. Eventually, almost everyone accepted that no silver bullet would ever be found. Yet, claims about ''silver bullets'' pop up now and again, even today.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Some{{who|date=February 2016}} interpret{{why|date=February 2016}} ''[[no silver bullet]]'' to mean that software engineering failed.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} However, with further reading, Brooks goes on to say: "We will surely make substantial progress over the next 40 years; an order of magnitude over 40 years is hardly magical ..."{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The search for a single key to success never worked. All known technologies and practices have only made incremental improvements to productivity and quality. Yet, there are no silver bullets for any other profession, either. Others interpret ''no silver bullet'' as proof that software engineering has finally matured and recognized that projects succeed due to hard work.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

However, it could also be said that there are, in fact, a range of ''silver bullets'' today, including lightweight methodologies (see "[[Project management]]"), spreadsheet calculators, customized [[web browser|browsers]], in-site search engines, database report generators, integrated design-test coding-editors with memory/differences/undo, and specialty shops that generate niche software, such as information web sites, at a fraction of the cost of totally customized web site development.  Nevertheless, the field of software engineering appears too complex and diverse for a single "silver bullet" to improve most issues, and each issue accounts for only a small portion of all software problems.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== 1990 to 1999: Prominence of the Internet ==
The rise of the [[Internet]] led to very rapid growth in the demand for international information display/e-mail systems on the World Wide Web.  Programmers were required to handle illustrations, maps, photographs, and other images, plus simple animation, at a rate never before seen, with few well-known methods to optimize image display/storage (such as the use of thumbnail images).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The growth of browser usage, running on the [[HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML), changed the way in which information-display and retrieval was organized.  The widespread network connections led to the growth and prevention of international [[computer virus]]es on MS Windows computers, and the vast proliferation of spam e-mail became a major design issue in e-mail systems, flooding communication channels and requiring semi-automated pre-screening. Keyword-search systems evolved into web-based [[search engine]]s, and many software systems had to be re-designed, for international searching, depending on [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) techniques.  Human natural-language translation systems were needed to attempt to translate the information flow in multiple foreign languages, with many software systems being designed for multi-language usage, based on design concepts from human translators.  Typical computer-user bases went from hundreds, or thousands of users, to, often, many-millions of international users.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

== 2000 to 2015: Lightweight methodologies ==
With the expanding demand for software in many smaller organizations, the need for inexpensive software solutions led to the growth of simpler, faster methodologies that developed running software, from requirements to deployment, quicker &amp; easier.  The use of rapid-prototyping evolved to entire ''lightweight methodologies'', such as [[Extreme Programming]] (XP), which attempted to simplify many areas of software engineering, including requirements gathering and reliability testing for the growing, vast number of small software systems.  Very large software systems still used heavily documented methodologies, with many volumes in the documentation set; however, smaller systems had a simpler, faster alternative approach to managing the development and maintenance of software calculations and algorithms, information storage/retrieval and display.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Current trends in software engineering ===
Software engineering is a young discipline, and is still developing. The directions in which software engineering is developing include:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

====Aspects====
[[Aspect-oriented programming|Aspects]] help software engineers deal with [[quality attributes]] by providing tools to add or remove [[boilerplate code]] from many areas in the [[source code]]. Aspects describe how all objects or functions should behave in particular circumstances. For example, [[aspect (computer science)|aspects]] can add [[debugging]], [[Data logging|logging]], or [[Lock (software engineering)|locking]] control into all objects of particular types. Researchers are currently working to understand how to use aspects to design general-purpose code. Related concepts include [[generative programming]] and [[Template (programming)|templates]].

====Agile====
[[Agile software development]] guides [[software development]] projects that evolve rapidly with changing expectations and competitive markets. Proponents of this method believe that heavy, document-driven processes (like [[TickIT]], [[Capability Maturity Model|CMM]] and [[ISO 9000]]) are fading in importance{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Some people believe that companies and agencies export many of the jobs that can be guided by heavy-weight processes{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}&lt;!--outsoucing?--&gt;. Related concepts include [[extreme programming]], [[Scrum (development)|scrum]], and [[lean software development]].

====Experimental====
[[Experimental software engineering]] is a branch of software engineering interested in devising [[experiment]]s on software, in collecting data from the experiments, and in devising laws and theories from this data. Proponents of this method advocate that the nature of software is such that we can advance the knowledge on software through experiments only{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

====Software product lines====
[[product family engineering|Software product lines, aka product family engineering,]] is a systematic way to produce ''families'' of software systems, instead of creating a succession of completely individual products. This method emphasizes extensive, systematic, formal [[code reuse]], to try to industrialize the software development process.

The Future of Software Engineering conference (FOSE), held at ICSE 2000, documented the state of the art of SE in 2000 and listed many problems to be solved over the next decade. The FOSE tracks at the  ICSE 2000 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ul.ie/%7Eicse2000/|title=ICSE2000: Call for Participation|work=ul.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ICSE 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/icse07/|title=ICSE 2007: Home|work=ucl.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferences also help identify the state of the art in software engineering.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

=== Software engineering today ===
The profession is trying to define its boundary and content. The Software Engineering Body of Knowledge [[SWEBOK]] has been tabled as an ISO standard during 2006 (ISO/IEC TR 19759).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 2006, ''Money Magazine'' and ''Salary.com'' rated software engineering as the best job in America in terms of growth, pay, stress levels, flexibility in hours and working environment, creativity, and how easy it is to enter and advance in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}, "MONEY Magazine and Salary.com researched hundreds of jobs, considering their growth, pay, stress-levels and other factors. These careers ranked highest. 1. Software Engineer..."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sub-disciplines ==

=== Artificial intelligence ===
A wide variety of platforms has allowed different aspects of AI to develop, ranging from [[expert systems]] such as [[Cyc]] to [[Deep learning#Software libraries|deep-learning frameworks]] to robot platforms such as the [[Roomba]] with open interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hackingroomba.com/|title=Hacking Roomba|work=hackingroomba.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018023300/http://hackingroomba.com/|archivedate=18 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent advances in deep [[artificial neural network]]s and distributed computing have led to a proliferation of software libraries, including [[Deeplearning4j]], [[TensorFlow]], [[Theano (software)|Theano]] and [[Torch (machine learning)|Torch]].

A 2011 [[McKinsey &amp; Company|McKinsey Global Institute]] study found a shortage of 1.5 million highly trained data and AI professionals and managers&lt;ref name="McKinsey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Manyika |first1=James |first2=Michael |last2=Chui |first3=Jaques |last3=Bughin |first4=Brad |last4=Brown |first5=Richard |last5=Dobbs |first6=Charles |last6=Roxburgh |first7=Angela Hung |last7=Byers |title=Big Data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivity |publisher=McKinsey Global Institute |date=May 2011 |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/Insights/MGI/Research/Technology_and_Innovation/Big_data_The_next_frontier_for_innovation |accessdate=16 January 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306232114/http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/big_data_the_next_frontier_for_innovation |archivedate=6 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of private bootcamps have developed programs to meet that demand, including free programs like [[The Data Incubator]] or paid programs like [[General Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5869">'''IEEE 1451''' is a set of [[smart transducer]] interface standards developed by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) Instrumentation and Measurement Society’s Sensor Technology Technical Committee describing a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting transducers (sensors or actuators) to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks.  One of the key elements of these standards is the definition of [[Transducer electronic data sheet]]s (TEDS) for each transducer. The TEDS is a memory device attached to the transducer, which stores transducer identification, calibration, correction data, and manufacturer-related information.  The goal of the IEEE 1451 family of standards is to allow the access of transducer data through a common set of interfaces whether the transducers are connected to systems or networks via a wired or wireless means.

== Transducer electronic data sheet ==

A '''transducer electronic data sheet''' (TEDS) is a standardized method of storing [[transducer]] ([[sensor]]s or [[actuator]]s) identification, calibration, correction data, and manufacturer-related information.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  TEDS formats are defined in the IEEE 1451 set of [[smart transducer]] interface standards developed by the [[IEEE Instrumentation and Measurement Society]]'s Sensor Technology Technical Committee that describe a set of open, common, network-independent communication interfaces for connecting transducers  to microprocessors, instrumentation systems, and control/field networks.

One of the key elements of the IEEE 1451 standards is the definition of TEDS for each transducer. The TEDS can be implemented as a memory device attached to the transducer and containing information needed by a measurement instrument or control system to interface with a transducer. TEDS can, however, be implemented in two ways.  First, the TEDS can reside in embedded memory, typically an [[EEPROM]], within the transducer itself which is connected to the measurement instrument or control system.  Second, a virtual TEDS can exist as a data file accessible by the measurement instrument or control system. A virtual TEDS extends the standardized TEDS to legacy sensors and applications where embedded memory may not be available.

An '''induction heater''' is a key piece of equipment used in all forms of [[induction heating]]. Typically an induction heater operates at either medium frequency (MF) or radio frequency (RF) ranges.&lt;ref name="Rudnev229"&gt;Rudnev, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four main component systems form the basis of a modern induction heater
* the control system, control panel, or ON / OFF switch; in some cases this system can be absent  
* the power unit ([[power inverter]])
* the work head ([[transformer]])
* and the heating coil ([[inductor]])

'''How it works'''&lt;br&gt;
Induction heating is a non contact method of heating a conductive body by utilising a strong [[magnetic field]]. Supply (mains) frequency 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz induction heaters incorporate a coil directly fed from the electricity supply, typically for lower power industrial applications where lower surface temperatures are required. Some specialist induction heaters operate at 400&amp;nbsp;Hz, the Aerospace power frequency.

Induction heating should not be confused with induction cooking, as the two heating systems are mostly very physically different from each other. Notably, induction heating (aka forging) systems work with long metallic rods and sheets to bring them up to temperatures as high as ~2500c for work to be done on them.

==Main equipment components==
An induction heater typically consists of three elements.

===Power unit===
Often referred to as the inverter or generator. This part of the system is used to take the mains frequency and increase it to anywhere between 10&amp;nbsp;Hz and 400&amp;nbsp;[[kHz]]. Typical output power of a unit system is from 2&amp;nbsp;kW to 500&amp;nbsp;[[kW]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 627.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work head===
This contains a combination of [[capacitors]] and transformers and is used to mate the power unit to the work coil.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 628.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work coil===
Also known as the inductor, the coil is used to transfer the energy from the power unit and work head to the work piece. Inductors range in complexity from a simple wound [[solenoid]] consisting of a number of turns of copper tube wound around a mandrel, to a precision item machined from solid copper, brazed and soldered together. As the inductor is the area where the heating takes place, coil design is one of the most important elements of the system and is a science in itself.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
''Radio frequency'' (''RF'') ''induction'' generators work in the frequency range from 100&amp;nbsp;kHz up to 10&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]]. Most induction heating devices (with induction frequency control) have a frequency range of 100&amp;nbsp;Hz to 200&amp;nbsp;kHz. The output range typically incorporates 2.5&amp;nbsp;kW to 40&amp;nbsp;kW. Induction heaters in this range are used for smaller components and applications such as [[induction hardening]] an engine valve.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt;

''MF induction'' generators work from 1&amp;nbsp;kHz to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. The output range typically incorporates 50&amp;nbsp;kW to 500&amp;nbsp;kW. Induction heaters within these ranges are used on medium to larger components and applications such as the [[induction forging]] of a shaft.&lt;ref name="Rudnev229"/&gt;

''Mains'' (or ''supply'') ''frequency'' induction coils are driven directly from the standard AC supply. Most mains-frequency induction coils are designed for single phase operation, and are low-current devices intended for localised heating, or low-temperature surface area heating, such as in a [[drum heater]].

==History==
The basic principle involved in induction heating was discovered by [[Michael Faraday]] as early as 1831. Faraday's work involved the use of a switched DC supply provided by a [[battery (electricity)|battery]] and two windings of copper wire wrapped around an iron core. It was noted that when the switch was closed a momentary [[Electric current|current]] flowed in the secondary winding, which could be measured by means of a [[galvanometer]]. If the circuit remained energized then the current ceased to flow. On opening the switch a current again flowed in the secondary winding, but in the opposite direction. Faraday concluded that since no physical link existed between the two windings, the current in the secondary coil must be caused by a voltage that was induced from the first coil, and that the current produced was directly proportional to the rate of change of the [[magnetic flux]].&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the principles were put to use in the design of [[transformer]]s, [[Electric motor|motors]] and [[Electric generator|generators]] where undesirable heating effects were controlled by the use of a [[laminated core]].

Early in the 20th century engineers started to look for ways to harness the heat-generating properties of [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] for the purpose of melting steel. This early work used motor generators to create the medium frequency (MF) current, but the lack of suitable [[alternators]] and [[capacitors]] of the correct size held back early attempts. However, by 1927 the first MF induction melting system had been installed by [[EFCO]] in Sheffield, England.

At around the same time engineers at [[Midvale Steel]] and The Ohio Crankshaft Company in America were attempting to use the surface-heating effect of the MF current to produce localized surface [[case hardening]] in [[crankshafts]]. Much of this work took place at the [[frequencies]] of 1920 and 3000&amp;nbsp;Hz as these were the easiest frequencies to produce with the equipment available. As with many technology-based fields it was the advent of World War II which led to huge developments in the utilization of induction heating in the production of vehicle parts and munitions.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, the technology advanced and units in the 3 to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz frequency range with powers outputs to 600&amp;nbsp;kW became common place in [[induction forging]] and large [[induction hardening]] applications. The motor generator would remain the mainstay of MF power generation until the advent of high voltage [[semiconductors]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Early in the evolutionary process it became obvious to engineers that the ability to produce a higher radio frequency range of equipment would result in greater flexibility and open up a whole range of alternative applications. Methods were sought to produce these higher RF power supplies to operate in the 200 to 400&amp;nbsp;kHz range.

Development in this particular frequency range has always mirrored that of the [[radio transmitter]] and television broadcasting industry and indeed has often used component parts developed for this purpose. Early units utilised [[spark gap]] technology, but due to limitations the approach was rapidly superseded by the use of multi-electrode [[thermionic]] [[triode]] (valve) based oscillators. Indeed, many of the pioneers in the industry were also very involved in the radio and telecommunications industry and companies such as [[Philips|Phillips]], [[English Electric]] and Redifon were all involved in manufacturing induction heating equipment in the 1950s and 1960s.

The use of this technology survived until the early 1990s at which point the technology was all but replaced by power [[MOSFET]] and [[IGBT]] [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] equipment. However, there are still many [[vacuum tube|valve]] [[oscillators]] still in existence, and at extreme frequencies of 5&amp;nbsp;MHz and above they are often the only viable approach and are still produced.&lt;ref name="Rudnev632"&gt;Rudnev, p. 632.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mains frequency induction heaters are still widely used throughout manufacturing industry due to their relatively low cost and thermal efficiency compared to [[radiant heating]] where piece parts or steel containers need to be heated as part of a batch process line.

==Valve oscillator based power supply==
Due to its flexibility and potential frequency range, the valve oscillator based induction heater was until recent years widely used throughout industry.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 635.&lt;/ref&gt; Readily available in powers from 1&amp;nbsp;kW to 1&amp;nbsp;MW and in a frequency range from 100&amp;nbsp;kHz to many MHz, this type of unit found widespread use in thousands of applications including soldering and brazing, induction hardening, tube welding and [[induction shrink fitting]]. The unit consists of three basic elements:

===High voltage DC power supply===
The DC ([[direct current]]) power supply consists of a standard air or water cooled step-up transformer and a high voltage [[rectifier]] unit capable of generating voltages typically between 5 and 10&amp;nbsp;kV to power the oscillator. The unit needs to be rated at the correct [[kilovolt-ampere]] (kVA) to supply the necessary current to the oscillator. Early rectifier systems featured valve rectifiers such as GXU4 (high power high voltage half wave rectifier) but these were ultimately superseded by high voltage solid state rectifiers.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 636.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self exciting class 'C' oscillator===
The oscillator circuit is responsible for creating the elevated frequency electric current, which when applied to the work coil creates the magnetic field which heats the part. The basic elements of the circuit are an [[inductance]] (tank coil) and a [[capacitance]] (tank capacitor) and an oscillator valve. Basic electrical principles dictate that if a voltage is applied to a circuit containing a capacitor and inductor the circuit will oscillate in much the same way as a swing which has been pushed. Using our swing as an analogy if we do not push again at the right time the swing will gradually stop this is the same with the oscillator. The purpose of the valve is to act as a switch which will allow energy to pass into the oscillator at the correct time to maintain the oscillations. In order to time the switching, a small amount of energy is fed back to the grid of the [[triode]] effectively blocking or firing the device or allow it to conduct at the correct time. This so-called grid bias can be derived, either capacitively, conductively or inductively depending on whether the oscillator is a Colpitts, [[Hartley oscillator]], Armstrong tickler or a Meissner.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 690.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Means of power control===
Power control for the system can be achieved by a variety of methods. Many latter day units feature [[thyristor]] power control which works by means of a full wave AC ([[alternating current]]) drive varying the primary voltage to the input transformer. More traditional methods include [[three phase]] variacs ([[autotransformer]]) or motorised Brentford type voltage regulators to control the input voltage. Another very popular method was to use a two part tank coil with a primary and secondary winding separated by an air gap. Power control was affected by varying the magnetic coupling of the two coils by physically moving them relative to each other.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 478.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solid state power supplies==
In the early days of induction heating, the [[motor-generator]] was used extensively for the production of MF power up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz. While it is possible to generate multiples of the supply frequency such as 150&amp;nbsp;Hz using a standard induction motor driving an AC generator, there are limitations. This type of generator featured rotor mounted windings which limited the peripheral speed of the rotor due to the centrifugal forces on these windings. This had the effect of limiting the diameter of the machine and therefore its power and the number of poles which can be physically accommodated, which in turn limits the maximum operating frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 652.&lt;/ref&gt;

To overcome these limitations the induction heating industry turned to the inductor-generator. This type of machine features a toothed rotor constructed from a stack of punched iron laminations. The [[Excitation (magnetic)|excitation]] and AC windings are both mounted on the stator, the rotor is therefore a compact solid construction which can be rotated at higher peripheral speeds than the standard AC generator above thus allowing it to be greater in diameter for a given [[revolutions per minute|RPM]]. This larger diameter allows a greater number of poles to be accommodated and when combined with complex slotting arrangements such as the [[Lorenz gauge condition]] or Guy slotting which allows the generation of frequencies from 1 to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz.

As with all rotating electrical machines, high rotation speeds and small clearances are utilised to maximise flux variations. This necessitates that close attention is paid to the quality of bearings utilised and the stiffness and accuracy of rotor. Drive for the alternator is normally provided by a standard induction motor for convention and simplicity. Both vertical and horizontal configurations are utilised and in most cases the motor rotor and generator rotor are mounted on a common shaft with no coupling. The whole assembly is then mounted in a frame containing the motor [[stator]] and generator stator. The whole construction is mounted in a cubicle which features a heat exchanger and water cooling systems as required.

The motor-generator became the mainstay of medium frequency power generation until the advent of [[Solid state (electronics)|solid state]] technology in the early 1970s.

In the early 1970s the advent of solid state switching technology saw a shift from the traditional methods of induction heating power generation. Initially this was limited to the use of thyristors for generating the 'MF range of frequencies using discrete electronic control systems. 
 
State of the art units now employ SCR ([[silicon-controlled rectifier]]),&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 630.&lt;/ref&gt; IGBT or MOSFET technologies for generating the 'MF' and 'RF' current. The modern control system is typically a digital [[microprocessor]] based system utilising PIC, PLC ([[programmable logic controller]]) technology and surface mount manufacturing techniques for production of the printed circuit boards. Solid state now dominates the market and units from 1&amp;nbsp;kW to many megawatts in frequencies from 1&amp;nbsp;kHz to 3&amp;nbsp;MHz including dual frequency units are now available.&lt;ref name="Rudnev632"/&gt;

A whole range of techniques are employed in the generation of MF and RF power using semiconductors, the actual technique employed depends often on a complex range of factors. The typical generator will employ either a current or a voltage fed topology.  The actual approach employed will be a function of the required power, frequency, individual application, the initial cost and subsequent running costs. Irrespective of the approach employed however, all units tend to feature four distinct elements:&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;

===AC to DC rectifier===
This takes the mains supply voltage and converts it from the supply frequency of 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz and also converts it to 'DC'. This can supply a variable DC voltage, a fixed DC voltage or a variable DC current. In the case of a variable systems, they are used to provide overall power control for the system. Fixed voltage rectifiers need to be used in conjunction with an alternative means of power control. This can be done by utilising a switch mode regulator or a by using a variety of control methods within the inverter section.

===DC to AC inverter===
The [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] converts the DC supply to a single phase AC output at the relevant frequency. This features the SCR, IGBT or MOSFETS and in most cases is configured as an [[H-bridge]]. The H-bridge has four legs each with a switch, the output circuit is connected across the centre of the devices. When the relevant two switches are closed current flows through the load in one direction, these switches then open and the opposing two switches close allowing current to flow in the opposite direction. By precisely timing the opening and closing of the switches, it is possible to sustain oscillations in the load circuit.

===Output circuit===
The output circuit has the job of matching the output of the inverter to that required by the coil. This can in it simplest form be a capacitor or in some cases will feature a combination of capacitors and transformers.

===Control system===
The control section monitors all the parameters in the load circuit, the inverter and supplies switching pulses at the appropriate time to supply energy to the output circuit. Early systems featured discrete electronics with variable [[potentiometers]] to adjust switching times, current limits, voltage limits and frequency trips. However, with the advent of [[microcontroller]] technology, the majority of advanced systems now feature digital control.

==The voltage-fed inverter==
The voltage-fed inverter features a filter [[capacitor]] on the input to the inverter and a series resonant output circuits. The voltage-fed system is extremely popular and can be used with either SCRs up to frequencies of 10&amp;nbsp;kHz, IGBTs to 100&amp;nbsp;kHz and MOSFETs up to 3&amp;nbsp;MHz. A voltage-fed inverter with a series connection to a parallel load is also known as a third order system. Basically this is similar to solid state, but in this system the series connected internal capacitor and inductor are connected to a parallel output tank circuit. The principal advantage of this type of system is the robustness of the inverter due to the internal circuit effectively isolating the output circuit making the switching components less susceptible to damage due to coil flash-overs or mismatching.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 640.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The current-fed inverter==
The current-fed inverter is different from the voltage-fed system in that it utilizes a variable DC input followed by a large inductor at the input to the inverter bridge. The power circuit features a parallel resonant circuit and can have operating frequencies typically from 1&amp;nbsp;kHz to 1&amp;nbsp;MHz. As with the voltage-fed system, SCRs are typically used up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz with IGBTs and MOSFETs being used at the higher frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;Rudnev, p. 645.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Suitable materials ==
[[Induction heating#Details|Suitable materials]] are those with high [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] (100-500) which are heated below the [[Curie point|Curie temperature]] of that material.

The '''International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis''' ('''IIASA''') is an international research organization located in [[Laxenburg]], near [[Vienna]], in [[Austria]]. IIASA conducts [[interdisciplinary]] scientific studies on [[natural environment|environmental]], [[economic]], [[technological]] and [[social issues]] in the context of human dimensions of [[global change]]. IIASA’s mission is "to provide insights and guidance to policymakers worldwide by finding solutions to global and universal problems through applied systems analysis in order to improve human and social wellbeing and to protect the environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA%20Strategic%20Plan%202011-20201.pdf IIASA's New Strategic Plan 2011-2020], retrieved 2 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
IIASA brings its experience of managing international tensions through science to today's [[global issue]]s. Its multinational and multidisciplinary teams of researchers have a growing membership, now including the world's four largest economies.

The institute is currently directed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175200/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/director.html?sb=1 Pavel Kabat]. [[Nebojsa Nakicenovic]] is the current Deputy Director General/ Deputy CEO.  Past directors have included  [[Howard Raiffa]], professor at [[Harvard]]'s [[Harvard Business School|Business School]] and [[Kennedy School of Government]], Roger Levien, former Vice President for Strategy at [[Xerox]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110123131844/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/fileadmin/H00/hordijk_CV-IES.pdf Leen Hordijk], former Director at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100414042251/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php Institute for Environment and Sustainability], Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Ispra, Italy, and Detlof von Winterfeldt, professor at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.www.mcu.es/bibliotecas/docs/MC/2012/CongresoBP/leviening.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

IIASA is a non-governmental institution funded by scientific organizations in its member countries, which currently include: Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, Egypt, Finland, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Ukraine, and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA_NMO.html IIASA's National Member Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050627082900/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA_NMO.html |date=27 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the Institute also comes from contracts, grants, and donations from governments, international organizations, academia, business, and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/whatisiiasa/funding/funding.html IIASA Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 4{{nbsp}}October 1972 representatives of the [[Soviet Union]], [[United States]], and 10 other countries from the Eastern and Western blocs met at [[The Royal Society]] in [[London]] to sign the charter establishing IIASA.&lt;ref&gt;Profile of IISA appended to summary of "Energy in a Finite World" (1981) http://www.iiasa.ac.at/publication/more_XB-81-202.php&lt;/ref&gt; It was the culmination of six years’ effort driven forward by both the US President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and the USSR Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]]. For IIASA it was the beginning of a remarkable project to use scientific cooperation to build bridges across the [[Cold War]] divide and to confront growing global problems on a truly international scale.&lt;ref&gt;McDONALD, A. (1998), Scientific Cooperation as a Bridge Across the Cold War Divide: The Case of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) . Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 866: 55–83. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09147.x&lt;/ref&gt; The first scientist had arrived at IIASA in June, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Jermen Gvishiani and Roger E. Lewis in Foreword to "Energy in a Finite World"(1981) http://www.iiasa.ac.at/publication/more_XB-81-202.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, success at bridge building and successful science would go hand in hand. But neither was a foregone conclusion. This was the 1970s, and most research organizations focused on national issues. Few encouraged researchers from different countries or disciplines to work together for the greater good.

To achieve its ambitious research vision, IIASA would have to break down the barriers between nations and disciplines. This it did, building international multidisciplinary teams to confront innumerable global challenges, both long-standing and emerging.   For example, a study on water pollution carried out in the 1980s by a team of IIASA chemists, biologists, and economists still forms the basis of modern water policy design in Japan, USA, and the former USSR.

When the [[Cold War]] ended (in 1991), IIASA’s sponsoring countries could have said “mission accomplished” and disbanded the Institute. IIASA had certainly helped foster mutual understanding among scientists from East and West. But it had also done more than this. IIASA had shown the scientific benefits of bringing together different nationalities and disciplines to work toward common goals.  Indeed, this approach has been widely imitated, for example, in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]].

So instead of closing in the 1990s the Institute broadened its mandate from the East and West to a truly global focus.  Today IIASA brings together a wide range of scientific skills to provide science-based insights into critical policy issues in international and national debates on global change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/docs/history_short.html?sb=3 A Brief History of IIASA], retrieved 2 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==
IIASA research focuses on complex problems that extend beyond a single country or a single discipline.

In 2010, IIASA launched a new strategic plan for the next ten years, which focuses on three general problem areas: Energy and Climate Change, Food and Water, and Poverty and Equity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Research.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year approximately 200 researchers from over 35 countries research at IIASA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/whatisiiasa/informationkit/flyer-iiasa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They work on these broader topics within and across 9 research programs: Advanced Systems Analysis, Ecosystems Services and Management, Energy, Evolution and Ecology, Mitigation of Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gases, Risk, Policy and Vulnerability, Transitions to New Technologies, Water, and World Population.

'''Major Projects'''

Ten IIASA scientists were among the authors of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (the work of the IPCC, including the contributions of many scientists, was recognised by the joint award of the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize|2007]] [[Nobel Peace Prize]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/achievments/iiasaandthenobelprize/ipcc/IPCC.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000256/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/achievments/iiasaandthenobelprize/ipcc/IPCC.en.html |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Energy Assessment, released in 2012.  The report was a result of collaborative and integrated work of over 500 authors, analysts and reviewers worldwide who contributed independent, scientifically based and policy-relevant analysis of current and emerging energy issues and options. The assessment provides a thorough assessment of energy-related issues including sustainable development, including poverty eradication, climate change mitigation, health, energy security and energy access.&lt;ref&gt;GEA, 2012: [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Flagship-Projects/Global-Energy-Assessment/Home-GEA.en.html Global Energy Assessment] - Toward a Sustainable Future, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire assessment is available online as a PDF.

The Water Futures and Solutions: World Water Scenarios initiative, launched in 2012, aims to provide a similarly broad assessment of global water challenges, in much the same scope as the Global Energy Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Global-Water-Futures-and-Solutions--World-Water-Scen.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115120757/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Global-Water-Futures-and-Solutions--World-Water-Scen.en.html |archivedate=15 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIASA researchers are major contributors to Working Groups II and III of the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/ResearchPartners/Climate-Change---IPCC-Fifth-Assessment-Report-.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, IIASA is also one of the three ''"pillar institutions"'' of the [[Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1295571237693/Ehrgeizig-Wiener-Wittgenstein-Center-will-an-Spitze-der-Demographie-Institute ''Der Standard'', 31 January 2011: “Vienna Wittgenstein Centre aims for top position among demography institutes worldwide”]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3809">'''Josette Rey-Debove''', born November 16, 1929 in Calais (Pas-de-Calais), France and died February 22, 2005 in [[Senegal]], was a [[lexicographer]] and [[semiologist]], wife and colleague of Alain Rey. She was the first female lexicographer in France, and held many prominent posts in this field, where she used her influence to promote [[feminist]] changes to French language usage.

== Early career ==
A graduate of the [[University of Sorbonne]], with a doctorate of linguistics, she began her career in 1952 as a lecturer of French at the College of Paris. The following year, she became an editor of language dictionaries at the Société du Nouveau Littré. She subsequently worked at Dictionnaires Le Robert, the most prominent publisher of dictionaries in the French language. It was there that she met Alain Rey, whom she married on September 11, 1954.

She contributed to dictionaries for [[Dictionnaires Le Robert]], collaborating on the Petit Robert for the French language, at Robert des Enfants (the company's division for publishing the Children's Robert dictionaries), then to Dictionnaire du français (foreign language edition) and to Robert Méthodique-Brio. In 1977, she became secretary-general of Dictionnaires Le Robert, a position she held until 1994.

==Influence==
A well-known linguist who promoted feminist changes to French usage, she was named to various commissions to develop the standards of the  language : the Commission de la féminisation du vocabulaire au ministère des droits de la femme between 1984 et 1985, the Commission d'expertise pour la réforme de l'orthographe au Conseil supérieur de la langue française in 1989, the Commission d'orientation pour la simplification du language administratif au ministère de la Fonction publique et de la Réforme de l'État in 2001, the Office québécois de la langue française sur la terminologie, la néologie et la méthodologie du travail terminologique during the 1970s.

She was also a professor of lexicology and semiology at the University Paris III-Sorbonne Nouvelle throughout the 1970s, subsequently at the University Paris VII-Denis Diderot during the 1980s, and at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales beginning in 2002. A friend of many of the members of [[Oulipo]] (Bernard Cerquiglini, Paul Fournel), she was their visiting scholar in 1986.

==Awards==
* [[Ordre national du Québec]] (National Order of Quebec) in 2004
* Chevalier (Knight) of the [[Ordre national du Mérite]] (National Order of Merit) of France.

A scholar's discipline is commonly defined and recognized by a [[faculty (division)|university faculties.]] That person will be accredited by [[learned society|learned societies]] to which he or she belongs along with the [[academic journal]]s in which he or she publishes. However, no formal criteria exist for defining an academic discipline.

Disciplines varies between universities and programs. These discipline will have well-defined rosters of journals and conferences supported by a few universities and publications. A discipline may have branches, that are called sub-disciplines.

There is no consensus on how some academic disciplines should be classified (e.g., whether [[anthropology]] and [[linguistics]] are disciplines of [[social science]]s or fields within the [[humanities]]). More generally, the proper criteria for organizing knowledge into disciplines are also open to debate.

The most widely used type of speaker in the 2010s is the '''dynamic speaker,''' invented in 1925 by [[Edward W. Kellogg]] and [[Chester W. Rice]].  The dynamic speaker operates on the same basic principle as a [[dynamic microphone]], but in reverse, to produce sound from an electrical signal. When an alternating current electrical [[audio signal]] is applied to its [[voice coil]], a coil of wire suspended in a circular gap between the poles of a [[permanent magnet]], the coil is forced to move rapidly back and forth due to [[Faraday's law of induction]], which causes a [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]] (usually conically shaped) attached to the coil to move back and forth, pushing on the air to create [[sound wave]]s. Besides this most common method, there are several alternative technologies that can be used to convert an electrical signal into sound. The sound source (e.g., a sound recording or a microphone) must be amplified or strengthened with an [[audio power amplifier]] before the signal is sent to the speaker.

Speakers are typically housed in a [[speaker enclosure]] or speaker cabinet which is often a rectangular or square box made of wood or sometimes plastic. The enclosure's materials and design  play an important role in the quality of the sound.   Where [[high fidelity]] reproduction of sound is required, multiple loudspeaker transducers are often mounted in the same enclosure, each reproducing a part of the audible frequency range ''(picture at right)''.  In this case the individual speakers are referred to as "drivers" and the entire unit is called a loudspeaker.  Drivers made for reproducing high audio frequencies are called [[tweeter]]s, those for middle frequencies are called [[mid-range speaker|mid-range]] drivers, and those for low frequencies are called [[woofer]]s. Smaller loudspeakers are found in devices such as [[Radio receiver|radios]], [[television]]s, portable audio players, [[computer]]s, and [[electronic musical instrument]]s. Larger loudspeaker systems are used for music, [[Sound reinforcement system|sound reinforcement]] in theatres and concerts, and in [[public address system]]s.

==Terminology==
The term "loudspeaker" may refer to individual transducers (also known as "drivers") or to complete speaker systems consisting of an [[Loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]] including one or more drivers.
 
To adequately reproduce a wide range of frequencies with even coverage, most loudspeaker systems employ more than one driver, particularly for higher [[sound pressure level]] or maximum accuracy. Individual drivers are used to reproduce different frequency ranges. The drivers are named [[subwoofer]]s (for very low frequencies); [[woofer]]s (low frequencies); [[mid-range speaker]]s (middle frequencies); [[tweeter]]s (high frequencies); and sometimes [[supertweeters]], optimized for the highest audible frequencies. The terms for different speaker drivers differ, depending on the application. In two-way systems there is no mid-range driver, so the task of reproducing the mid-range sounds falls upon the woofer and tweeter. Home stereos use the designation "tweeter" for the high frequency driver, while professional concert systems may designate them as "HF" or "highs". When multiple drivers are used in a system, a "filter network", called a [[Audio crossover|crossover]], separates the incoming signal into different frequency ranges and routes them to the appropriate driver. A loudspeaker system with ''n'' separate frequency bands is described as "''n''-way speakers": a two-way system will have a woofer and a tweeter; a three-way system employs a woofer, a mid-range, and a tweeter. Loudspeaker driver of the type pictured are termed  "dynamic" (short for electrodynamic) to distinguish them from earlier drivers (i.e., [[moving iron speaker]]), or speakers using [[Piezoelectric speakers#Piezo tweeter|piezoelectric]] or [[Electrostatic loudspeaker|electrostatic]] systems, or any of several other sorts.

==History==
[[Johann Philipp Reis]] installed an electric loudspeaker in his ''[[telephone]]'' in 1861; it was capable of reproducing clear tones, but also could reproduce muffled [[speech]] after a few revisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.integratednetworkcable.com/technology/the-forgotten-johann-philipp-reis |title=The Forgotten Johann Philipp Reis |accessdate=2015-06-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612190406/https://www.integratednetworkcable.com/technology/the-forgotten-johann-philipp-reis |archivedate=2015-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Graham Bell]] patented his first electric loudspeaker (capable of reproducing intelligible speech) as part of his telephone in 1876, which was followed in 1877 by an improved version from [[Ernst Werner von Siemens|Ernst Siemens]].  During this time, [[Thomas Edison]] was issued a British patent for a system using compressed air as an amplifying mechanism for his early cylinder phonographs, but he ultimately settled for the familiar metal horn driven by a membrane attached to the stylus. In 1898, Horace Short patented a design for a loudspeaker driven by compressed air; he then sold the rights to [[Charles Algernon Parsons|Charles Parsons]], who was issued several additional British patents before 1910. A few companies, including the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] and [[Pathé]], produced record players using compressed-air loudspeakers. However, these designs were significantly limited by their poor sound quality and their inability to reproduce sound at low volume. Variants of the system were used for [[public address]] applications, and more recently, other variations have been used to test space-equipment resistance to the very loud sound and vibration levels that the launching of rockets produces.

The first experimental moving-coil (also called ''dynamic'') loudspeaker was invented by [[Oliver Lodge]] in 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/loudspeaker.html |title=Loudspeaker History |accessdate=2007-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905003027/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/loudspeaker.html |archivedate=September 5, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first practical moving-coil loudspeakers were manufactured by Danish engineer [[Peter L. Jensen]] and [[Edwin Pridham]] in 1915, in [[Napa, California]].&lt;ref name=korn&gt;Kornum, Rene. "[http://ing.dk/artikel/hoejttaleren-fylder-100-aar-og-foedselaren-er-dansk-179868 The loudspeaker is 100 years old]" ''[[Ingeniøren]]'', 4 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;  Like previous loudspeakers these used horns to amplify the sound produced by a small diaphragm.  Jensen was denied patents. Being unsuccessful in selling their product to telephone companies, in 1915 they changed their target market to radios and [[public address system]]s, and named their product [[Magnavox]]. Jensen was, for years after the invention of the loudspeaker, a part owner of The Magnavox Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/jensen.html |title=Jensen History |accessdate=2009-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509055508/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/jensen.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The moving-coil principle commonly used today in speakers was patented in 1924 by [[Chester W. Rice]] and [[Edward W. Kellogg]]. The key difference between previous attempts and the patent by Rice and Kellogg is the adjustment of mechanical parameters so that the fundamental resonance of the moving system is below the frequency where the cone's radiation impedance becomes uniform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of the Audio Engineering Society|volume= 52|issue=4|year=2004|pages=412–432 (p. 416)|url=http://www.aes.org/journal/online/JAES_V52/jaes.cfm?file=JAES_V52_4/JAES_V52_4_PG412.pdf|author=[[John M. Eargle|J. Eargle]] and M. Gander|title=Historical Perspectives and Technology Overview of Loudspeakers for Sound Reinforcemen}}&lt;/ref&gt; About this same period, [[Walter H. Schottky]] invented the first ribbon loudspeaker together with Dr. Erwin Gerlach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5knbV1opI?url=http://www.geocities.com/bioelectrochemistry/schottky.htm |url=http://www.geocities.com/bioelectrochemistry/schottky.htm |title=Walter Schottky |archivedate=2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These first loudspeakers used [[electromagnet]]s, because large, powerful [[permanent magnet]]s were generally not available at a reasonable price. The coil of an electromagnet, called a field coil, was energized by current through a second pair of connections to the driver. This winding usually served a dual role, acting also as a [[inductor|choke coil]], filtering the [[power supply]] of the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]] that the loudspeaker was connected to. AC ripple in the current was attenuated by the action of passing through the choke coil. However, AC line frequencies tended to modulate the audio signal going to the voice coil and added to the audible hum.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!-- Fact tag for entire paragraph --&gt; In 1930 [[Peter L. Jensen|Jensen]] introduced the first commercial fixed-magnet loudspeaker; however, the large, heavy iron magnets of the day were impractical and field-coil speakers remained predominant until the widespread availability of lightweight [[Alnico]] magnets after World War II.

In the 1930s, loudspeaker manufacturers began to combine two and three bandpasses' worth of drivers in order to increase [[frequency response]] and [[sound pressure]] level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audio Signal Processing and Coding |last=Spanias |first=Andreas |author2=Ted Painter |author3=Venkatraman Atti  |year=2007 |publisher=Wiley-Interscience |isbn=0-470-04196-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J7_nVWzx1Q4C }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937, the first film industry-standard loudspeaker system, "The [http://www.audioheritage.org/html/profiles/lmco/shearer.htm Shearer Horn] System for Theatres"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/lmco/bulletins/2b.jpg Lansingheritage.com: (1937 brochure image) ''The Shearer Horn System for Theatres'']&lt;/ref&gt; (a two-way system), was introduced by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. It used four 15″ low-frequency drivers, a crossover network set for 375&amp;nbsp;Hz, and a single multi-cellular horn with two compression drivers providing the high frequencies. [[John Kenneth Hilliard]], [[James Bullough Lansing]], and [[Douglas Shearer]] all played roles in creating the system. At the [[1939 New York World's Fair]], a very large two-way [[public address]] system was mounted on a tower at [[Flushing Meadows]]. The eight 27″ low-frequency drivers were designed by [[Rudy Bozak]] in his role as chief engineer for Cinaudagraph. High-frequency drivers were likely made by [[Western Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Bozak, R.T., ''Electronics'' magazine, June 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Altec Lansing]] introduced the ''604'', which became their most famous coaxial [[Altec Lansing Duplex|Duplex]] driver, in 1943. It incorporated a high-frequency horn that sent sound through the middle of a 15-inch woofer for near-point-source performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/altec/catalogs/1943/page05.jpg Lansing Heritage. ''Loudspeakers by Lansing: First Time in History. A Two-Way Loud Speaker in Compact Form.'' (1943 catalog image)]&lt;/ref&gt; Altec's "Voice of the Theatre" loudspeaker system arrived in the marketplace in 1945, offering better coherence and clarity at the high output levels necessary in movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lansingheritage.org/images/altec/catalogs/1966-vott/page2.jpg Lansing Heritage. ''1966 Voice of the Theatre'' (catalog image)]&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics; they made it the [[cinema (place)|film house]] industry standard in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;Audioheritage.org. [http://www.audioheritage.org/html/people/hilliard.htm ''Biography of John Hilliard''], Retrieved on May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954, [[Edgar Villchur]] developed the [[acoustic suspension]] principle of loudspeaker design in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].  This allowed for better bass response than previously from drivers mounted in smaller cabinets which was important during the transition to stereo recording and reproduction.  He and his partner [[Henry Kloss]] formed the [[Acoustic Research]] company to manufacture and market speaker systems using this principle.  Subsequently, continuous developments in enclosure design and materials led to significant audible improvements.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}&lt;!--citation also needed in [[Acoustic suspension]]--&gt; The most notable improvements to date in modern dynamic drivers, and the loudspeakers that employ them, are improvements in cone materials, the introduction of higher-temperature adhesives, improved permanent [[magnet]] materials, improved measurement techniques, computer-aided design, and finite element analysis.  At low frequencies, the application of electrical network theory to the acoustic performance allowed by various enclosure designs (initially by Thiele, and later by Small) has been very important at the design level.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

The most common type of driver, commonly called a '''dynamic loudspeaker''', uses a lightweight [[diaphragm (acoustics)|diaphragm]], or ''cone'', connected to a rigid ''basket'', or ''frame'', via a flexible suspension, commonly called a ''spider'', that constrains a [[voice coil]] to move axially through a cylindrical magnetic gap. When an electrical signal is applied to the [[voice coil]], a [[magnetic field]] is created by the electric [[Current (electricity)|current]] in the voice coil, making it a variable electromagnet. The coil and the driver's magnetic system interact, generating a mechanical force that causes the coil (and thus, the attached cone) to move back and forth, accelerating and reproducing sound under the control of the applied electrical signal coming from the [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]. The following is a description of the individual components of this type of loudspeaker.

The diaphragm is usually manufactured with a cone- or dome-shaped profile. A variety of different materials may be used, but the most common are paper, plastic, and metal. The ideal material would 1) be rigid, to prevent uncontrolled cone motions; 2) have low mass, to minimize starting force requirements and energy storage issues; 3) be well [[Absorption (acoustics)|damped]], to reduce vibrations continuing after the signal has stopped with little or no audible ringing due to its [[resonance]] frequency as determined by its usage. In practice, all three of these criteria cannot be met simultaneously using existing materials; thus, driver design involves [[trade-off]]s. For example, paper is light and typically well damped, but is not stiff; metal may be stiff and light, but it usually has poor damping; plastic can be light, but typically, the stiffer it is made, the poorer the damping. As a result, many cones are made of some sort of composite material. For example, a cone might be made of cellulose paper, into which some [[carbon fiber]], [[Kevlar]], [[Glass (fiber)|glass]], [[hemp]] or [[bamboo]] fibers have been added; or it might use a honeycomb sandwich construction; or a coating might be applied to it so as to provide additional stiffening or damping.

The chassis, frame, or basket, is designed to be rigid, avoiding deformation that could change critical alignments with the magnet gap, perhaps causing the voice coil to rub against the sides of the gap. Chassis are typically [[Casting (metalworking)|cast]] from aluminum alloy, or [[machine press|stamped]] from thin steel sheet, though in some drivers with large magnets cast chassis are preferable as sheet metal can easily be warped in whenever the loudspeaker is subjected to rough handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rumsey|first1=Francis|last2=McCormick|first2=Tim|title=Sound and recording|date=2009|publisher=Focal Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=978-0-240-52163-3|page=81|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other materials such as molded plastic and damped plastic compound baskets are becoming common, especially for inexpensive, low-mass drivers.   Metallic chassis can play an important role in conducting heat away from the voice coil; heating during operation changes resistance, causes physical dimensional changes, and if extreme, may even demagnetize permanent magnets.

The suspension system keeps the coil centered in the gap and provides a restoring (centering) force that returns the cone to a neutral position after moving. A typical suspension system consists of two parts: the ''spider'', which connects the diaphragm or voice coil to the frame and provides the majority of the restoring force, and the ''surround'', which helps center the coil/cone assembly and allows free pistonic motion aligned with the magnetic gap. The spider is usually made of a corrugated fabric disk, impregnated with a stiffening resin. The name comes from the shape of early suspensions, which were two concentric rings of [[Bakelite]] material, joined by six or eight curved "legs." Variations of this topology included the addition of a felt disc to provide a barrier to particles that might otherwise cause the voice coil to rub. The German firm Rulik still offers drivers with uncommon spiders made of wood.

The cone surround can be [[rubber]] or polyester [[foam]], or a ring of corrugated, resin coated fabric; it is attached to both the outer diaphragm circumference and to the frame. These diverse surround materials, their shape and treatment can dramatically affect the acoustic output of a driver; each implementation having advantages and disadvantages. Polyester foam, for example, is lightweight and economical, though usually leaking air to some degree, but is degraded by exposure to ozone, UV light, humidity and elevated temperatures, significantly limiting useful life with adequate performance.

The wire in a voice coil is usually made of [[copper]], though [[aluminum]]—and, rarely, [[silver]]—may be used.  The advantage of aluminum is its light weight, which reduces the moving mass compared to copper.  This raises the resonant frequency of the speaker and increases its efficiency.  A disadvantage of aluminum is that it is not easily soldered, and so connections are instead often crimped together and sealed.  These connections must be made well or they may fail in an intense environment of mechanical vibration.  Voice-coil wire cross sections can be circular, rectangular, or hexagonal, giving varying amounts of wire volume coverage in the magnetic gap space. The coil is oriented co-axially inside the gap; it moves back and forth within a small circular volume (a hole, slot, or groove) in the magnetic structure. The gap establishes a concentrated magnetic field between the two poles of a permanent magnet; the outside of the gap being one pole, and the center post (called the pole piece) being the other. The pole piece and backplate are often a single piece, called the poleplate or yoke.

Modern driver magnets are almost always permanent and made of [[ceramic]], [[ferrite (magnet)|ferrite]], [[Alnico]], or, more recently, [[Rare-earth magnet|rare earth]] such as [[neodymium]] and [[Samarium-cobalt magnet|samarium cobalt]]. Electrodynamic drivers were often used in musical instrument amplifier/speaker cabinets well into the 1950s;  there were economic savings in those using tube amplifiers as the field coil could, and usually did, do double duty as a power supply choke. A trend in design — due to increases in transportation costs and a desire for smaller, lighter devices (as in many home theater multi-speaker installations) — is the use of the last instead of heavier ferrite types. Very few manufacturers still produce [[field coil loudspeaker|electrodynamic loudspeakers with electrically powered field coils]], as was common in the earliest designs;  one of the last is a French firm. When high field-strength permanent magnets became available after WWII, Alnico, an alloy of aluminum, nickel, and cobalt became popular, since it dispensed with the problems of field-coil drivers. Alnico was used almost exclusively until about 1980, despite the embarrassing problem of Alnico magnets being partially degaussed (i.e., demagnetized) by accidental 'pops' or 'clicks' caused by loose connections, especially if used with a high-power amplifier. The damage can be reversed by "recharging" the magnet, but this requires uncommon specialist equipment and knowledge.

After 1980, most (but not quite all) driver manufacturers switched from Alnico to ferrite magnets, which are made from a mix of ceramic clay and fine particles of barium or strontium ferrite. Although the energy per kilogram of these ceramic magnets is lower than Alnico, it is substantially less expensive, allowing designers to use larger yet more economical magnets to achieve a given performance.

The size and type of magnet and details of the magnetic circuit differ, depending on design goals. For instance, the shape of the pole piece affects the magnetic interaction between the voice coil and the magnetic field, and is sometimes used to modify a driver's behavior. A "shorting ring", or [[Faraday loop]], may be included as a thin copper cap fitted over the pole tip or as a heavy ring situated within the magnet-pole cavity. The benefits of this complication is reduced impedance at high frequencies, providing extended treble output, reduced harmonic distortion, and a reduction in the inductance modulation that typically accompanies large voice coil excursions. On the other hand, the copper cap requires a wider voice-coil gap, with increased magnetic reluctance; this reduces available flux, requiring a larger magnet for equivalent performance.

Driver design—including the particular way two or more drivers are combined in an enclosure to make a speaker system—is both an art, involving subjective perceptions of [[timbre]] and sound quality and a science, involving measurements and experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis |first=Don |author2=Carolyn Davis |title=Sound System Engineering |publisher=Focal Press |year=1997 |edition=2 |page=350 |chapter=Loudspeakers and Loudspeaker Arrays |isbn=0-240-80305-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouyzH6vsIIwC&amp;pg=PA350 |accessdate=March 30, 2010 |language= |quote=We often give lip service to the fact that audio allows its practitioners to engage in both art and science.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fremer |first=Michael |date=April 2004 |title=Aerial Model 20T loudspeaker |journal=Stereophile |publisher=Source Interlink Media |url=http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/404aerial/# |accessdate=March 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/06/arts/home-entertainment-speaker-design-goes-modern.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Speaker Design Goes Modern |last=Fantel |first=Hans |date=June 6, 1993 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjusting a design to improve performance is done using a combination of magnetic, acoustic, mechanical, electrical, and material science theory, and tracked with high precision measurements and the observations of experienced listeners. A few of the issues speaker and driver designers must confront are distortion, radiation lobing, phase effects, off-axis response, and crossover artifacts. Designers can use an [[anechoic chamber]] to ensure the speaker can be measured independently of room effects, or any of several electronic techniques that, to some extent, substitute for such chambers. Some developers eschew anechoic chambers in favor of specific standardized room setups intended to simulate real-life listening conditions.

Fabrication of finished loudspeaker systems has become segmented, depending largely on price, shipping costs, and weight limitations. High-end speaker systems, which are typically heavier (and often larger) than economic shipping allows outside local regions, are usually made in their target market region and can cost $140,000 or more per pair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nolaspeakers.com/reviews/tas/EditorsChoice2007.html The Absolute Sound, issue 175, October 2007. hp's Workshop: HP's Editor's Choice Awards.

===Driver types===
[[File:Lautsprecher 4-wege 2.jpg|thumb|A four-way, high fidelity '''loudspeaker system'''. Each of the four drivers outputs a different frequency range; the fifth aperture at the bottom is a [[bass reflex]] port.]]

Individual electrodynamic drivers provide their best performance within a limited frequency range. Multiple drivers (e.g., subwoofers, woofers, mid-range drivers, and tweeters) are generally combined into a complete loudspeaker system to provide performance beyond that constraint. The three most commonly used sound radiation systems are the cone, dome and horn type drivers.

====Full-range drivers====
{{Main article|Full-range speaker}}
A full-range driver is a speaker designed to be used alone to reproduce an audio channel without the help of other drivers, and therefore must cover the entire audio frequency range. These drivers are small, typically {{convert|3|to|8|in|cm}} in diameter to permit reasonable high frequency response, and carefully designed to give low-distortion output at low frequencies, though with reduced maximum output level. Full-range (or more accurately, wide-range) drivers are most commonly heard in public address systems, in televisions (although some models are suitable for hi-fi listening), small radios, intercoms, some [[computer speaker]]s, etc. In [[hi-fi]] speaker systems, the use of wide-range drive units can avoid undesirable interactions between multiple drivers caused by non-coincident driver location or crossover network issues. Fans of wide-range driver hi-fi speaker systems claim a coherence of sound due to the single source and a resulting lack of interference, and likely also to the lack of crossover components. Detractors typically cite wide-range drivers' limited frequency response and modest output abilities (most especially at low frequencies), together with their requirement for large, elaborate, expensive enclosures—such as transmission lines, quarter wave resonators or horns—to approach optimum performance. With the advent of neodymium drivers, low-cost quarter-wave transmission lines are made possible and are increasingly made availably commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvart-bolge.com/#!concept/c1w4l|title=Kvart &amp; Bølge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|author=|date=|website=Kvart &amp; Bølge - Audiophile Quarter-Wave Full-Range Speakers -|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/top_10/celebrity/october-kickstarter-projects_1.html|title=Top 10 Entertainment|author=|date=|website=AskMen|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full-range drivers often employ an additional cone called a ''whizzer'': a small, light cone attached to the joint between the voice coil and the primary cone. The whizzer cone extends the high-frequency response of the driver and broadens its high frequency directivity, which would otherwise be greatly narrowed due to the outer diameter cone material failing to keep up with the central voice coil at higher frequencies. The main cone in a whizzer design is manufactured so as to flex more in the outer diameter than in the center. The result is that the main cone delivers low frequencies and the whizzer cone contributes most of the higher frequencies. Since the whizzer cone is smaller than the main diaphragm, output dispersion at high frequencies is improved relative to an equivalent single larger diaphragm.

Limited-range drivers, also used alone, are typically found in computers, toys, and [[clock radio]]s. These drivers are less elaborate and less expensive than wide-range drivers, and they may be severely compromised to fit into very small mounting locations. In these applications, sound quality is a low priority. The human ear is remarkably tolerant of poor sound quality, and the distortion inherent in limited-range drivers may enhance their output at high frequencies, increasing clarity when listening to spoken word material.

====Subwoofer====
{{Main article|Subwoofer}}
A [[subwoofer]] is a woofer driver used only for the lowest-pitched part of the audio spectrum: typically below 200&amp;nbsp;Hz for consumer systems,&lt;ref name="crutchfield.com"&gt;[http://www.crutchfield.com/S-5VsEXVgtser/Learn/learningcenter/home/speakers_glossary.html Home Speakers Glossary].

Since sound in this frequency range can easily bend around corners by [[diffraction]], the speaker aperture does not have to face the audience, and subwoofers can be mounted in the bottom of the enclosure, facing the floor.  This is eased by the limitations of human hearing at low frequencies;  such sounds cannot be located in space, due to their large wavelengths compared to higher frequencies which produce differential effects in the ears due to shadowing by the head, and diffraction around it, both of which we rely upon for localization clues.

To accurately reproduce very low bass notes without unwanted resonances (typically from cabinet panels), subwoofer systems must be solidly constructed and properly braced to avoid unwanted sounds of cabinet vibrations. As a result, good subwoofers are typically quite heavy. Many subwoofer systems include integrated [[power amplifier]]s and electronic [[Infrasound|subsonic]] (sub)-filters, with additional controls relevant to low-frequency reproduction (e.g., a crossover knob and a phase switch). These variants are known as "active" or "powered" subwoofers, with the former including a power amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |title=Glossary of Terms |work=Home Theater Design |publisher=ETS-eTech |page=1 |accessdate=March 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723231911/http://www.home-theater-designers.com/glossary.html |archivedate=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, "passive" subwoofers require external amplification.

In typical installations, subwoofers are physically separated from the rest of the speaker cabinets.  Because of propagation delay, their output may be somewhat out of phase from another subwoofer (on another channel) or slightly out of phase with the rest of the sound.  Consequently, a subwoofer's power amp often has a phase-delay adjustment (approximately 1 ms of delay is required for each additional foot of separation from the listener) which may improve performance of the system as a whole at subwoofer frequencies (and perhaps an octave or so above the crossover point).  However, the influence of room resonances (sometimes called [[standing waves]]) is typically so large that such issues are secondary in practice. Subwoofers are widely used in large concert and mid-sized venue [[sound reinforcement system]]s. Subwoofer cabinets are often built with a [[bass reflex]] port (i.e., a hole cut into the cabinet with a tube attached to it), a design feature which if properly engineered improves bass performance and increases efficiency.

====Woofer====
{{Main article|Woofer}}
A [[woofer]] is a driver that reproduces low frequencies. The driver works with the characteristics of the enclosure to produce suitable low frequencies (see [[speaker enclosure]] for some of the design choices available). Indeed, both are so closely connected that they must be considered together in use.  Only at design time do the separate properties of enclosure and woofer matter individually. Some loudspeaker systems use a woofer for the lowest frequencies, sometimes well enough that a subwoofer is not needed. Additionally, some loudspeakers use the woofer to handle middle frequencies, eliminating the mid-range driver. This can be accomplished with the selection of a tweeter that can work low enough that, combined with a woofer that responds high enough, the two drivers add coherently in the middle frequencies.

====Mid-range driver====
{{Main article|Mid-range speaker}}
A [[mid-range speaker]] is a loudspeaker driver that reproduces a band of frequencies generally between 1–6&amp;nbsp;kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be [[compression driver]]s (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the throat of a horn for added output level and control of radiation pattern.

====Tweeter====
[[File:Tw15ul9.jpg|right|thumb|[[Exploded view drawing|Exploded view]] of a dome tweeter.]]
{{Main article|Tweeter}}
A [[tweeter]] is a high-frequency driver that reproduces the highest frequencies in a speaker system.  A major problem in tweeter design is achieving wide angular sound coverage (off-axis response), since high frequency sound tends to leave the speaker in narrow beams.  Soft-dome tweeters are widely found in home stereo systems, and horn-loaded compression drivers are common in professional sound reinforcement. Ribbon tweeters have gained popularity in recent years, as the output power of some designs has been increased to levels useful for professional sound reinforcement, and their output pattern is wide in the horizontal plane, a pattern that has convenient applications in concert sound.&lt;ref&gt;Nieuwendijk, Joris A. (1988) [http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=5129 "Compact Ribbon Tweeter/Midrange Loudspeaker."] Audio Engineering Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coaxial drivers====
A coaxial driver is a loudspeaker driver with two or several combined concentric drivers. Coaxial drivers have been produced by many companies, such as [[Altec Lansing|Altec]], [[Tannoy]], [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]], [[KEF]], SEAS, B&amp;C Speakers, BMS, [[Cabasse (company)|Cabasse]] and [[Genelec]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genelec 8260A Technical Paper |url=http://www.genelec.com/documents/other/Genelec%208260A%20Technical%20Paper.pdf |date = September 2009|work= |publisher=Genelec |pages=3–4 |accessdate=24 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crossover===
{{Main article|Audio crossover}}
[[File:Passive Crossover.svg|thumb|right|A passive crossover.]]
[[File:Active Crossover.svg|thumb|right|Bi-amped.]]Used in [[multi-driver speaker systems]], the crossover is an assembly of filters that separate the input signal into different frequency ranges (i.e. "bands"), according to the requirements of each driver. Hence the drivers receive power only at their operating frequency (the sound frequency range they were designed for), thereby reducing distortion in the drivers and interference between them. The ideal characteristics of a crossover may include perfect out-of-band attenuation at the output of each filter, no amplitude variation ("ripple") within each passband, no phase delay between overlapping frequency bands, to name just a few.

Crossovers can be ''passive'' or ''active''. A [[Audio crossover#Passive crossovers|passive crossover]] is an electronic circuit that uses a combination of one or more [[resistor]]s, inductors, or non-polar [[capacitor]]s. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, passive crossovers have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in [[damping factor]] before the voice coil &lt;ref name=ActivePassive&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/biamp-vs-passive.htm ''Active Vs. Passive Crossovers.''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Audio crossover#Active crossovers|active crossover]] is an electronic filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands ''before'' power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass.&lt;ref name=ActivePassive/&gt; Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Acoustic Society. ''The B.A.S. Speaker'', September 1978. Peter W. Mitchell: "The D-23 crossover can be used for bi-amping, tri-amping, or even quad-amping."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some loudspeaker designs use a combination of passive and active crossover filtering, such as a passive crossover between the mid- and high-frequency drivers and an active crossover between the low-frequency driver and the combined mid- and high frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;EAW [http://www.eaw.com/products/KF/kf300.html ''KF300/600 Series&amp;nbsp;— Compact three-way VAT Systems''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424065507/http://www.eaw.com/products/kf/kf300.html |date=2012-04-24 }}.

Three-way loudspeaker switchable between bi-amped and fully passive modes. &lt;/ref&gt;

Passive crossovers are commonly installed inside speaker boxes and are by far the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, passive crossovers may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. Passive crossovers may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24&amp;nbsp;dB per octave. Passive crossovers can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances,&lt;ref name=PassiveDesign&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2004. [http://sound.whsites.net/lr-passive.htm ''Design of Passive Crossovers.''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. Passive crossovers, like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world.&lt;ref name=PassiveDesign/&gt; When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, [[dynamic range compression]] and limiting) control.&lt;ref name=ActivePassive/&gt;

===Enclosures===
{{Main article|Loudspeaker enclosure}}
[[File:4-Wege Lautsprecher.jpg|thumb|right|An unusual three-way speaker system. The cabinet is narrow to raise the frequency where a diffraction effect called the "baffle step" occurs.]]
Most loudspeaker systems consist of drivers mounted in an [[loudspeaker enclosure|enclosure]], or cabinet. The role of the enclosure is to prevent sound waves emanating from the back of a driver from interfering destructively with those from the front.  The sound waves emitted from the back are 180° [[out of phase]] with those emitted forward, so without an enclosure they  typically cause cancellations which significantly degrade the level and quality of sound at low frequencies.

The simplest driver mount is a flat panel (i.e., baffle) with the drivers mounted in holes in it. However, in this approach, sound frequencies with a wavelength longer than the baffle dimensions are canceled out, because the antiphase radiation from the rear of the cone interferes with the radiation from the front. With an infinitely large panel, this interference could be entirely prevented. A sufficiently large sealed box can approach this behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/jun04/articles/qa0604-6.htm Q. Sound On Sound, June 2004. ''What's the difference between ported and un-ported monitors?'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 Record Producer. ''Infinite baffle''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102014320/http://www.record-producer.com/learn.cfm?a=97 |date=January 2, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since panels of infinite dimensions are impossible, most enclosures function by containing the rear radiation from the moving diaphragm. A sealed enclosure prevents transmission of the sound emitted from the rear of the loudspeaker by confining the sound in a rigid and airtight box. Techniques used to reduce transmission of sound through the walls of the cabinet include thicker cabinet walls, lossy wall material, internal bracing, curved cabinet walls—or more rarely, [[visco-elastic]] materials (e.g., mineral-loaded [[bitumen]]) or thin [[lead]] sheeting applied to the interior enclosure walls.

However, a rigid enclosure reflects sound internally, which can then be transmitted back through the loudspeaker diaphragm—again resulting in degradation of sound quality. This can be reduced by internal absorption using absorptive materials (often called "damping"), such as [[glass wool]], wool, or synthetic fiber batting, within the enclosure. The internal shape of the enclosure can also be designed to reduce this by reflecting sounds away from the loudspeaker diaphragm, where they may then be absorbed.

Other enclosure types alter the rear sound radiation so it can add constructively to the output from the front of the cone. Designs that do this (including ''[[bass reflex]]'', ''passive radiator'', ''transmission line'', etc.) are often used to extend the effective low-frequency response and increase low-frequency output of the driver.

To make the transition between drivers as seamless as possible, system designers have attempted to time-align (or phase adjust) the drivers by moving one or more driver mounting locations forward or back so that the acoustic center of each driver is in the same vertical plane. This may also involve tilting the face speaker back, providing a separate enclosure mounting for each driver, or (less commonly) using electronic techniques to achieve the same effect. These attempts have resulted in some unusual cabinet designs.

The speaker mounting scheme (including cabinets) can also cause [[diffraction]], resulting in peaks and dips in the frequency response. The problem is usually greatest at higher frequencies, where wavelengths are similar to, or smaller than, cabinet dimensions. The effect can be minimized by rounding the front edges of the cabinet, curving the cabinet itself, using a smaller or narrower enclosure, choosing a strategic driver arrangement, using absorptive material around a driver, or some combination of these and other schemes.

====Horn loudspeakers====
[[File:3-way horn speaker.png|thumb|A three-way loudspeaker that uses horns in front of each of the three drivers: a shallow horn for the tweeter, a long, straight horn for mid frequencies and a folded horn for the woofer]]
{{Main article|Horn loudspeaker}}
[[Horn loudspeaker]]s are the oldest form of loudspeaker system. The use of [[Horn (acoustic)|horns]] as voice-amplifying [[megaphone]]s dates at least to the 17th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Trumpet, Speaking and Hearing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and horns were used in mechanical [[Phonograph|gramophones]] as early as 1857. Horn loudspeakers use a shaped waveguide in front of or behind the driver to increase the directivity of the loudspeaker and to transform a small diameter, high pressure condition at the driver cone surface to a large diameter, low pressure condition at the mouth of the horn. This improves the acoustic—electro/mechanical impedance match between the driver and ambient air, increasing efficiency, and focusing the sound over a narrower area.

The size of the throat, mouth, the length of the horn, as well as the area expansion rate along it must be carefully chosen to match the drive to properly provide this transforming function over a range of frequencies (every horn performs poorly outside its acoustic limits, at both high and low frequencies). The length and cross-sectional mouth area required to create a bass or sub-bass horn require a horn many feet long. 'Folded' horns can reduce the total size, but compel designers to make compromises and accept increased complication such as cost and construction. Some horn designs not only fold the low frequency horn, but use the walls in a room corner as an extension of the horn mouth. In the late 1940s, horns whose mouths took up much of a room wall were not unknown amongst hi-fi fans. Room sized installations became much less acceptable when two or more were required.

A horn loaded speaker can have a sensitivity as high as 110&amp;nbsp;dB at 2.83 volts (1 watt at 8 ohms) at 1 meter. This is a hundredfold increase in output compared to a speaker rated at 90&amp;nbsp;dB sensitivity, and is invaluable in applications where high sound levels are required or amplifier power is limited.

===Wiring connections===
[[File:Banana plugs speaker.jpg|thumb|right|[[Binding post|Two-way binding posts]] on a loudspeaker, connected using [[Banana connector|banana plugs]].]]
[[File:bi-amp capable.jpg|thumb|right|A 4-ohm loudspeaker with two pairs of binding posts capable of accepting bi-wiring after the removal of two metal straps.]]

Most home [[hi-fi]] loudspeakers use two wiring points to connect to the source of the signal (for example, to the audio amplifier or [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]]). To accept the wire connection, the loudspeaker enclosure may have [[binding post]]s, spring clips, or a panel-mount jack. If the wires for a pair of speakers are not connected with respect to the proper [[electrical polarity]] (the + and − connections on the speaker and amplifier should be connected + to + and − to −;  speaker cable is almost always marked so that one conductor of a pair can be distinguished from the other, even if it has run under or behind things in its run from amplifier to speaker location), the loudspeakers are said to be "out of phase" or more properly "out of polarity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d7ft6F8ZUdcC&amp;pg=PA186|title=The Sound Reinforcement Handbook|first1=Gary|last1=Davis|first2=Gary D.|last2=Davis|date=14 April 1989|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L38MrvScG3gC&amp;pg=PA298|title=The Audio Dictionary: Third Edition, Revised and Expanded|first1=Glenn D.|last1=White|first2=Gary J.|last2=Louie|date=1 October 2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given identical signals, motion in one cone is in the opposite direction of the other. This typically causes monophonic material in a stereo recording to be canceled out, reduced in level, and made more difficult to localize, all due to destructive interference of the sound waves. The cancellation effect is most noticeable at frequencies where the loudspeakers are separated by a quarter wavelength or less; low frequencies are affected the most. This type of miswiring error does not damage speakers, but is not optimal for listening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lesWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA57|title=Audio in Media|first=Stanley R.|last=Alten|date=22 January 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K1t0GxyvVbMC&amp;pg=PA130|title=Guide to Sound Systems for Worship|first=Jon F.|last=Eiche|date=14 April 1990|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|accessdate=14 April 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[sound reinforcement system]], [[PA system]] and [[instrument amplifier]] speaker enclosures, cables and some type of jack or connector are typically used. Lower- and mid-priced sound system and instrument speaker cabinets often use 1/4" speaker cable jacks. Higher-priced and higher powered sound system cabinets and instrument speaker cabinets often use [[Speakon]] connectors. Speakon connectors are considered to be safer for high wattage amplifiers, because the connector is designed so that human users cannot touch the connectors.

===Wireless speakers===
{{main article|Wireless speaker}}
[[File:HP Roar Wireless Speaker.jpg|thumbnail|right|HP Roar Wireless Speaker]]
[[Wireless speakers]] are very similar to traditional (wired) loudspeakers, but they receive audio signals using radio frequency (RF) waves rather than over audio cables. There is normally an amplifier integrated in the speaker's cabinet because the RF waves alone are not enough to drive the speaker. This integration of amplifier and loudspeaker is known as an [[active loudspeaker]]. Manufacturers of these loudspeakers design them to be as lightweight as possible while producing the maximum amount of audio output efficiency.

Wireless speakers still need power, so require a nearby AC power outlet, or possibly batteries. Only the wire to the amplifier is eliminated.

==Specifications==
[[File:Eltax Silverstone 200 loudspeaker label.jpg|thumb|Specifications label on a loudspeaker.]]
Speaker specifications generally include:
* '''Speaker or driver type''' (individual units only)&amp;nbsp;– [[Full-range]], woofer, tweeter, or [[Mid-range speaker|mid-range]].
* '''Size''' of individual drivers. For cone drivers, the quoted size is generally the outside diameter of the basket.&lt;ref&gt;EIA RS-278-B "Mounting Dimensions for Loudspeakers"&lt;/ref&gt; However, it may less commonly also be the diameter of the cone surround, measured apex to apex, or the distance from the center of one mounting hole to its opposite. Voice-coil diameter may also be specified. If the loudspeaker has a compression horn driver, the diameter of the horn throat may be given.
* '''Rated Power'''&amp;nbsp;– Nominal (or even continuous) [[Electrical power|power]], and peak (or maximum short-term) power a loudspeaker can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; it is never the sound output the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies.&lt;ref name=SpeakerDamage&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2006. [http://sound.whsites.net/bi-amp-p1.htm ''Speaker Damage''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage.&lt;ref name=WhyTweetersBlow&gt;Elliott Sound Products. Rod Elliott, 2006. [http://sound.whsites.net/tweeters.htm ''Why Do Tweeters Blow When Amplifiers Distort?''] Retrieved on June 16, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power handling capacity can be quite confusing.
* '''[[Electrical impedance|Impedance]]'''&amp;nbsp;– typically 4&amp;nbsp;Ω (ohms), 8&amp;nbsp;Ω, etc.&lt;ref&gt;EIA RS-299 "Loudspeakers, Dynamic; Magnetic Structures and Impedance"&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Baffle or enclosure type''' (enclosed systems only)&amp;nbsp;– Sealed, bass reflex, etc.

**Class 1: maximum SPL 110-119 dB, the type of loudspeaker used for reproducing a person speaking in a small space or for [[background music]]; mainly used as fill speakers for Class 2 or Class 3 speakers; typically small 4" or 5" woofers and dome tweeters
**Class 2: maximum SPL 120-129 dB, the type of medium power-capable loudspeaker used for reinforcement in small to medium spaces or as fill speakers for Class 3 or Class 4 speakers; typically 5" to 8" woofers and dome tweeters

**Class 4: maximum SPL 140 dB and higher, very high power-capable loudspeakers used as mains in medium to large spaces (or for fill speakers for these medium to large spaces); 10" to 15" woofers and 3" compression drivers

and optionally:
* '''Crossover frequency(ies)''' (multi-driver systems only)&amp;nbsp;– The nominal frequency boundaries of the division between drivers.
* '''[[Frequency response]]'''&amp;nbsp;– The measured, or specified, output over a specified range of frequencies for a constant input level varied across those frequencies. It sometimes includes a variance limit, such as within "± 2.5&amp;nbsp;dB."
* '''[[Thiele/Small|Thiele/Small parameters]]''' (individual drivers only)&amp;nbsp;– these include the driver's ''F''&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (resonance frequency), ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;ts&lt;/sub&gt; (a driver's ''Q''; more or less, its [[damping factor]] at resonant frequency), ''V''&lt;sub&gt;as&lt;/sub&gt; (the equivalent air compliance volume of the driver), etc.
* '''Sensitivity'''&amp;nbsp;– The sound pressure level produced by a loudspeaker in a non-reverberant environment, often specified in dB and measured at 1 meter with an input of 1 watt (2.83 rms volts into 8&amp;nbsp;Ω), typically at one or more specified frequencies. Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material.
* '''Maximum sound pressure level'''&amp;nbsp;– The highest output the loudspeaker can manage, short of damage or not exceeding a particular distortion level. Manufacturers often use this rating in marketing material—commonly without reference to frequency range or distortion level.

===Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers===
{{Main article|Electrical characteristics of dynamic loudspeakers}}

The load that a driver presents to an amplifier consists of a complex [[electrical impedance]]—a combination of resistance and both [[Capacitance|capacitive]] and [[Inductance|inductive]] [[Electrical reactance|reactance]], which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), and the effects of air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal [[resistive]] load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a passive crossover between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.

To make sound, a loudspeaker is driven by modulated electric current (produced by an [[audio power amplifier|amplifier]]) that pass through a "speaker coil"  which then (through [[Electrical inductance|inductance]]) creates a magnetic field around the coil, creating a [[magnetic field]]. The electric current variations that pass through the speaker are thus converted to a varying magnetic field, whose interaction with the driver's magnetic field moves the speaker diaphragm, which thus forces the driver to produce air motion that is similar to the original signal from the amplifier.

===Electromechanical measurements===
Examples of typical [[Loudspeaker measurement|measurements]] are: amplitude and phase characteristics vs. frequency; impulse response under one or more conditions (e.g., square waves, sine wave bursts, etc.); directivity vs. frequency (e.g., horizontally, vertically, spherically, etc.); [[harmonic distortion|harmonic]] and [[intermodulation distortion]] vs. [[Sound pressure|sound pressure level]] (SPL) output, using any of several test signals; stored energy (i.e., ringing) at various frequencies; impedance vs. frequency; and small-signal vs. large-signal performance. Most of these measurements require sophisticated and often expensive equipment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nti-audio.com/en/solutions/testing-devices/speaker.aspx|title=Equipment used for speaker, driver &amp; cabinet testing|first=[[NTi Audio|NTi]]|last=Audio|website=www.nti-audio.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to perform, and also good judgment by the operator, but the raw sound pressure level output is rather easier to report and so is often the only specified value—sometimes in misleadingly exact terms. The sound pressure level (SPL) a loudspeaker produces is measured in [[decibel]]s ([[DBSPL|dB&lt;sub&gt;spl&lt;/sub&gt;]]).

===Efficiency vs. sensitivity===
Loudspeaker efficiency is defined as the [[sound power]] output divided by the electrical power input. Most loudspeakers are inefficient transducers; only about 1% of the electrical energy sent by an amplifier to a typical home loudspeaker is converted to acoustic energy. The remainder is converted to heat, mostly in the voice coil and magnet assembly. The main reason for this is the difficulty of achieving proper [[impedance matching]] between the [[acoustic impedance]] of the drive unit and the air it radiates into. (At low frequencies, improving this match is the main purpose of speaker enclosure designs). The efficiency of loudspeaker drivers varies with frequency as well. For instance, the output of a woofer driver decreases as the input frequency decreases because of the increasingly poor match between air and the driver.

Driver ratings based on the SPL for a given input are called sensitivity ratings and are notionally similar to efficiency. [[Sensitivity (electronics)|Sensitivity]] is usually defined as so many decibels at 1&amp;nbsp;W electrical input, measured at 1 meter (except for [[headphones]]), often at a single frequency. The voltage used is often 2.83&amp;nbsp;V&lt;sub&gt;RMS&lt;/sub&gt;, which is 1&amp;nbsp;watt into an 8&amp;nbsp;Ω (nominal) speaker impedance (approximately true for many speaker systems). Measurements taken with this reference are quoted as dB with 2.83&amp;nbsp;V @ 1&amp;nbsp;m.

The sound pressure output is measured at (or mathematically scaled to be equivalent to a measurement taken at) one meter from the loudspeaker and on-axis (directly in front of it), under the condition that the loudspeaker is radiating into an infinitely large space and mounted on an [[infinite baffle]]. Clearly then, sensitivity does not correlate precisely with efficiency, as it also depends on the directivity of the driver being tested and the acoustic environment in front of the actual loudspeaker. For example, a cheerleader's horn produces more sound output in the direction it is pointed by concentrating sound waves from the cheerleader in one direction, thus "focusing" them. The horn also improves impedance matching between the voice and the air, which produces more acoustic power for a given speaker power. In some cases, improved impedance matching (via careful enclosure design) lets the speaker produce more acoustic power.

* Typical home loudspeakers have sensitivities of about 85 to 95&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m—an efficiency of 0.5–4%.
* Sound reinforcement and public address loudspeakers have sensitivities of perhaps 95 to 102&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m—an efficiency of 4–10%.
* Rock concert, stadium PA, marine hailing, etc. speakers generally have higher sensitivities of 103 to 110&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m—an efficiency of 10–20%.

A driver with a higher maximum power rating cannot necessarily be driven to louder levels than a lower-rated one, since sensitivity and power handling are largely independent properties. In the examples that follow, assume (for simplicity) that the drivers being compared have the same electrical impedance, are operated at the same frequency within both driver's respective pass bands, and that power compression and distortion are low. For the first example, a speaker 3&amp;nbsp;dB more sensitive than another produces double the sound power (is 3&amp;nbsp;dB louder) for the same power input. Thus, a 100&amp;nbsp;W driver ("A") rated at 92&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m sensitivity puts out twice as much acoustic power as a 200&amp;nbsp;W driver ("B") rated at 89&amp;nbsp;dB for 1&amp;nbsp;W @ 1&amp;nbsp;m when both are driven with 100&amp;nbsp;W of input power. In this particular example, when driven at 100&amp;nbsp;W, speaker A produces the same SPL, or [[loudness]] as speaker B would produce with 200&amp;nbsp;W input. Thus, a 3&amp;nbsp;dB increase in sensitivity of the speaker means that it needs half the amplifier power to achieve a given SPL. This translates into a smaller, less complex power amplifier—and often, to reduced overall system cost.

The interaction of a loudspeaker system with its environment is complex and is largely out of the loudspeaker designer's control. Most listening rooms present a more or less reflective environment, depending on size, shape, volume, and furnishings. This means the sound reaching a listener's ears consists not only of sound directly from the speaker system, but also the same sound delayed by traveling to and from (and being modified by) one or more surfaces. These reflected sound waves, when added to the direct sound, cause cancellation and addition at assorted frequencies (e.g., from [[resonant room modes]]), thus changing the timbre and character of the sound at the listener's ears. The human brain is very sensitive to small variations, including some of these, and this is part of the reason why a loudspeaker system sounds different at different listening positions or in different rooms.

A significant factor in the sound of a loudspeaker system is the amount of absorption and diffusion present in the environment. Clapping one's hands in a typical empty room, without draperies or carpet, produces a zippy, fluttery echo due both to a lack of absorption and to reverberation (that is, repeated echoes) from flat reflective walls, floor, and ceiling. The addition of hard surfaced furniture, wall hangings, shelving and even baroque plaster ceiling decoration changes the echoes, primarily because of diffusion caused by reflective objects with shapes and surfaces having sizes on the order of the sound wavelengths. This somewhat breaks up the simple reflections otherwise caused by bare flat surfaces, and spreads the reflected energy of an incident wave over a larger angle on reflection.

===Placement===
In a typical rectangular listening room, the hard, parallel surfaces of the walls, floor and ceiling cause primary [[acoustic resonance]] nodes in each of the three dimensions: left-right, up-down and forward-backward.&lt;ref&gt;"Acoustics", Leo Beranek, chapter 10, McGraw Hill Books, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there are more complex resonance modes involving three, four, five and even all six boundary surfaces combining to create [[standing wave]]s. Low frequencies excite these modes the most, since long wavelengths are not much affected by furniture compositions or placement. The mode spacing is critical, especially in small and medium size rooms like recording studios, home theaters and broadcast studios. The proximity of the loudspeakers to room boundaries affects how strongly the resonances are excited as well as affecting the relative strength at each frequency. The location of the listener is critical, too, as a position near a boundary can have a great effect on the perceived balance of frequencies. This is because standing wave patterns are most easily heard in these locations and at lower frequencies, below the [[Schroeder frequency]]&amp;nbsp;– typically around 200–300&amp;nbsp;Hz, depending on room size.

===Directivity===
Acousticians, in studying the radiation of sound sources have developed some concepts important to understanding how loudspeakers are perceived. The simplest possible radiating source is a point source, sometimes called a simple source. An ideal point source is an infinitesimally small point radiating sound. It may be easier to imagine a tiny pulsating sphere, uniformly increasing and decreasing in diameter, sending out sound waves in all directions equally, independent of frequency.

Any object radiating sound, including a loudspeaker system, can be thought of as being composed of combinations of such simple point sources. The radiation pattern of a combination of point sources is not the same as for a single source, but depends on the distance and orientation between the sources, the position relative to them from which the listener hears the combination, and the frequency of the sound involved. Using geometry and calculus, some simple combinations of sources are easily solved; others are not.

One simple combination is two simple sources separated by a distance and vibrating out of phase, one miniature sphere expanding while the other is contracting. The pair is known as a doublet, or dipole, and the radiation of this combination is similar to that of a very small dynamic loudspeaker operating without a baffle. The directivity of a dipole is a figure 8 shape with maximum output along a vector that connects the two sources and minimums to the sides when the observing point is equidistant from the two sources, where the sum of the positive and negative waves cancel each other. While most drivers are dipoles, depending on the enclosure to which they are attached, they may radiate as monopoles, dipoles (or bipoles). If mounted on a finite baffle, and these out of phase waves are allowed to interact, dipole peaks and nulls in the frequency response result. When the rear radiation is absorbed or trapped in a box, the diaphragm becomes a monopole radiator. Bipolar speakers, made by mounting in-phase monopoles (both moving out of or into the box in unison) on opposite sides of a box, are a method of approaching omnidirectional radiation patterns.

In real life, individual drivers are complex 3D shapes such as cones and domes, and they are placed on a baffle for various reasons. A mathematical expression for the directivity of a complex shape, based on modeling combinations of point sources, is usually not possible, but in the far field, the directivity of a loudspeaker with a circular diaphragm is close to that of a flat circular piston, so it can be used as an illustrative simplification for discussion. As a simple example of the mathematical physics involved, consider the following:
the formula for far field directivity of a flat circular piston in an infinite baffle is &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;p(\theta) = \frac{p_0 J_1(k_a \sin \theta)}{k_a \sin \theta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
where &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;k_a=\frac{2\pi a}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the pressure on axis, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the piston radius, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the wavelength (i.e. &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lambda = \frac{c}{f} = \frac{\text{speed of sound}}{\text{frequency}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;) &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the angle off axis and &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;J_1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the [[Bessel function]] of the first kind.

A planar source radiates sound uniformly for low frequencies' wavelengths longer than the dimensions of the planar source, and as frequency increases, the sound from such a source focuses into an increasingly narrower angle. The smaller the driver, the higher the frequency where this narrowing of directivity occurs. Even if the diaphragm is not perfectly circular, this effect occurs such that larger sources are more directive. Several loudspeaker designs approximate this behavior. Most are electrostatic or planar magnetic designs.

Various manufacturers use different driver mounting arrangements to create a specific type of sound field in the space for which they are designed. The resulting radiation patterns may be intended to more closely simulate the way sound is produced by real instruments, or simply create a controlled energy distribution from the input signal (some using this approach are called [[studio monitor|monitors]], as they are useful in checking the signal just recorded in a studio). An example of the first is a room corner system with many small drivers on the surface of a 1/8 sphere. A system design of this type was patented and produced commercially by Professor Amar Bose—the 2201. Later [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] models have deliberately emphasized production of both direct and reflected sound by the loudspeaker itself, regardless of its environment. The designs are controversial in [[Bose Corporation#Criticisms|high fidelity circles]], but have proven commercially successful. Several other manufacturers' designs follow similar principles.

Directivity is an important issue because it affects the frequency balance of sound a listener hears, and also the interaction of the speaker system with the room and its contents. A very directive (sometimes termed 'beamy') speaker (i.e., on an axis perpendicular to the speaker face) may result in a reverberant field lacking in high frequencies, giving the impression the speaker is deficient in treble even though it measures well on axis (e.g., "flat" across the entire frequency range). Speakers with very wide, or rapidly increasing directivity at high frequencies, can give the impression that there is too much treble (if the listener is on axis) or too little (if the listener is off axis). This is part of the reason why on-axis frequency response measurement is not a complete characterization of the sound of a given loudspeaker.

==Other speaker designs==

While dynamic cone speakers remain the most popular choice, many other speaker technologies exist.

===With a diaphragm===

====Moving-iron loudspeakers====
{{main article|Moving iron speaker}}
[[image:Moving-iron_cone_speaker_1929.png|thumb|right|200px|Moving iron speaker]]
The moving iron speaker was the first type of speaker that was invented. Unlike the newer dynamic (moving coil) design, a moving-iron speaker uses a stationary coil to vibrate a magnetized piece of metal (called the iron, reed, or armature).  The metal is either attached to the diaphragm or is the diaphragm itself.  This design was the original loudspeaker design, dating back to the early telephone.  Moving iron drivers are inefficient and can only produce a small band of sound.  They require large magnets and coils to increase force.&lt;ref name="moving iron"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Moving-Iron Speaker|url=http://www.vias.org/crowhurstba/crowhurst_basic_audio_vol1_042.html|website=vias.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Balanced armature drivers (a type of moving iron driver) use an armature that moves like a see-saw or diving board.  Since they are not damped, they are highly efficient, but they also produce strong resonances.  They are still used today for high end [[earphones]] and hearing aids, where small size and high efficiency are important.&lt;ref name="balanced armature"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hertsens|first1=Tyll|title=How Balanced Armature Receivers/Drivers Work|url=http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/how-balanced-armature-receiversdrivers-work#IboPCt5E0YtmLTAL.97|website=innerfidelity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Piezoelectric speakers====
{{main article|Piezoelectric speaker}}
{{See also|Piezo tweeter}}
[[File:2007-07-24 Piezoelectric buzzer.jpg|thumb|A piezoelectric buzzer. The white ceramic piezoelectric material can be seen fixed to a metal diaphragm.]]
Piezoelectric speakers are frequently used as beepers in [[watch]]es and other electronic devices, and are sometimes used as tweeters in less-expensive speaker systems, such as computer speakers and portable radios. Piezoelectric speakers have several advantages over conventional loudspeakers: they are resistant to overloads that would normally destroy most high frequency drivers, and they can be used without a crossover due to their electrical properties. There are also disadvantages: some amplifiers can oscillate when driving capacitive loads like most piezoelectrics, which results in distortion or damage to the amplifier. Additionally, their frequency response, in most cases, is inferior to that of other technologies. This is why they are generally used in single frequency (beeper) or non-critical applications.

Piezoelectric speakers can have extended high frequency output, and this is useful in some specialized circumstances; for instance, [[sonar]] applications in which piezoelectric variants are used as both output devices (generating underwater sound) and as input devices (acting as the sensing components of underwater microphones). They have advantages in these applications, not the least of which is simple and solid state construction that resists seawater better than a ribbon or cone based device would.

In 2013, [[Kyocera]] introduced piezoelectric ultra-thin medium-size film speakers with only 1 millimeter of thickness and 7 grams of weight for their 55" [[OLED]] televisions and they hope the speakers will also be used in PCs and tablets. Besides medium-size, there are also large and small sizes which can all produce relatively the same quality of sound and volume within 180 degrees. The highly responsive speaker material provides better clarity than traditional TV speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/29/kyocera-piezoelectric-film-speaker/#continued |title=Kyocera piezoelectric film speaker delivers 180-degree sound to thin TVs and tablets (update: live photos) |date=August 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Magnetostatic loudspeakers====
{{Main article|Magnetostatic loudspeaker}}
[[File:Magnepan MG1.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Magnetostatic loudspeaker]]
Instead of a voice coil driving a speaker cone, a magnetostatic speaker uses an array of metal strips bonded to a large film membrane. The magnetic field produced by signal current flowing through the strips interacts with the field of permanent bar magnets mounted behind them. The force produced moves the membrane and so the air in front of it.  Typically, these designs are less efficient than conventional moving-coil speakers.

====Magnetostrictive speakers====
Magnetostrictive transducers, based on [[magnetostriction]], have been predominantly used as [[sonar]] ultrasonic sound wave radiators, but their use has spread also to audio speaker systems. Magnetostrictive speaker drivers have some special advantages: they can provide greater force (with smaller excursions) than other technologies; low excursion can avoid distortions from large excursion as in other designs; the magnetizing coil is stationary and therefore more easily cooled; they are robust because delicate suspensions and voice coils are not required. Magnetostrictive speaker modules have been produced by Fostex&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Takeyoshi |last=Yamada |title=Fostex Prototypes Tabletop Vibration Speaker System Using Super Magnetostrictor |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20051117/110823/ |publisher=Tech-On! |location= |date=November 2005 |accessdate=2009-10-05 |quote=The cone-shaped speaker system is 95 mm in diameter and 90 mm high.

====Electrostatic loudspeakers====
{{Main article|Electrostatic loudspeaker}}
[[Image:Es spk.gif|frame|right|170px|Schematic showing an electrostatic speaker's construction and its connections. The thickness of the diaphragm and grids has been exaggerated for the purpose of illustration.]]
[[Electrostatic loudspeaker]]s use a high voltage electric field (rather than a magnetic field) to drive a thin statically charged membrane. Because they are driven over the entire membrane surface rather than from a small voice coil, they ordinarily provide a more linear and lower-distortion motion than dynamic drivers. They also have a relatively narrow dispersion pattern that can make for precise sound-field positioning.  However, their optimum listening area is small and they are not very efficient speakers.  They have the disadvantage that the diaphragm excursion is severely limited because of practical construction limitations—the further apart the stators are positioned, the higher the voltage must be to achieve acceptable efficiency.  This increases the tendency for electrical arcs as well as increasing the speaker's attraction of dust particles. Arcing remains a potential problem with current technologies, especially when the panels are allowed to collect dust or dirt and are driven with high signal levels.

Electrostatics are inherently dipole radiators and due to the thin flexible membrane are less suited for use in enclosures to reduce low frequency cancellation as with common cone drivers. Due to this and the low excursion capability, full range electrostatic loudspeakers are large by nature, and the bass [[roll-off|rolls off]] at a frequency corresponding to a quarter wavelength of the narrowest panel dimension. To reduce the size of commercial products, they are sometimes used as a high frequency driver in combination with a conventional dynamic driver that handles the bass frequencies effectively.

Electrostatics are usually driven through a step-up transformer that multiplies the voltage swings produced by the power amplifier.  This transformer also multiplies the capacitive load that is inherent in electrostatic transducers, which means the effective impedance presented to the power amplifiers varies widely by frequency.  A speaker that is nominally 8 ohms may actually present a load of 1 ohm at higher frequencies, which is challenging to some amplifier designs.

====Ribbon and planar magnetic loudspeakers====
A '''ribbon speaker''' consists of a thin metal-film ribbon suspended in a magnetic field. The electrical signal is applied to the ribbon, which moves with it to create the sound. The advantage of a ribbon driver is that the ribbon has very little [[mass]]; thus, it can accelerate very quickly, yielding very good high-frequency response. Ribbon loudspeakers are often very fragile—some can be torn by a strong gust of air. Most ribbon tweeters emit sound in a dipole pattern. A few have backings that limit the dipole radiation pattern. Above and below the ends of the more or less rectangular ribbon, there is less audible output due to phase cancellation, but the precise amount of directivity depends on ribbon length. Ribbon designs generally require exceptionally powerful magnets, which makes them costly to manufacture. Ribbons have a very low resistance that most amplifiers cannot drive directly. As a result, a step down transformer is typically used to increase the current through the ribbon. The amplifier "sees" a load that is the ribbon's resistance times the transformer turns ratio squared. The transformer must be carefully designed so that its frequency response and parasitic losses do not degrade the sound, further increasing cost and complication relative to conventional designs.

Planar magnetic speakers (having printed or embedded conductors on a flat diaphragm) are sometimes described as ribbons, but are not truly ribbon speakers. The term planar is generally reserved for speakers with roughly rectangular flat surfaces that radiate in a bipolar (i.e., front and back) manner. Planar magnetic speakers consist of a flexible membrane with a voice coil printed or mounted on it. The [[Laplace force|current flowing through the coil interacts with the magnetic field]] of carefully placed magnets on either side of the diaphragm, causing the membrane to vibrate more or less uniformly and without much bending or wrinkling. The driving force covers a large percentage of the membrane surface and reduces resonance problems inherent in coil-driven flat diaphragms.

====Bending wave loudspeakers====
Bending wave transducers use a diaphragm that is intentionally flexible. The rigidity of the material increases from the center to the outside. Short wavelengths radiate primarily from the inner area, while longer waves reach the edge of the speaker. To prevent reflections from the outside back into the center, long waves are absorbed by a surrounding damper. Such transducers can cover a wide frequency range (80&amp;nbsp;Hz to 35,000&amp;nbsp;Hz) and have been promoted as being close to an ideal point sound source.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stereophile.com/floorloudspeakers/687ohm/ Stereophile magazine. ''Ohm Walsh 5 loudspeaker'' (review by Dick Olsher, June 1987)]&lt;/ref&gt; This uncommon approach is being taken by only a very few manufacturers, in very different arrangements.

The Ohm Walsh loudspeakers use a unique driver designed by [[Lincoln Walsh]], who had been a radar development engineer in WWII. He became interested in audio equipment design and his last project was a unique, one-way speaker using a single driver. The cone faced down into a sealed, airtight enclosure. Rather than move back-and-forth as conventional speakers do, the cone rippled and created sound in a manner known in RF electronics as a "transmission line". The new speaker created a cylindrical sound field. Lincoln Walsh died before his speaker was released to the public. The Ohm Acoustics firm has produced several loudspeaker models using the Walsh driver design since then.  German Physiks, an audio equipment firm in Germany, also produces speakers using this approach.

The German firm, Manger, has designed and produced a bending wave driver that at first glance appears conventional. In fact, the round panel attached to the voice coil bends in a carefully controlled way to produce full range sound.&lt;ref&gt;Manger, Josef W. [http://issuu.com/manger-msw/docs/acoustical_reality-1-?mode=window&amp;viewMode=singlePage "Acoustical Reality"].&lt;/ref&gt; Josef W. Manger was awarded with the "Diesel Medal" for extraordinary developments and inventions by the German institute of inventions.

====Flat panel loudspeakers====
There have been many attempts to reduce the size of speaker systems, or alternatively to make them less obvious. One such attempt was the development of "exciter" transducer coils mounted to flat panels to act as sound sources, most accurately called exciter/panel drivers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} These can then be made in a neutral color and hung on walls where they are less noticeable than many speakers, or can be deliberately painted with patterns, in which case they can function decoratively. There are two related problems with flat panel techniques: first, a flat panel is necessarily more flexible than a cone shape in the same material, and therefore moves as a single unit even less, and second, resonances in the panel are difficult to control, leading to considerable distortions. Some progress has been made using such lightweight, rigid, materials such as [[Styrofoam]], and there have been several flat panel systems commercially produced in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/Articles/300328/Sound+ideas.htm|title=The Engineer June 2007 article discussing solutions to direct sound|author=|date=|website=theengineer.co.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heil air motion transducers====
{{Main article|Air Motion Transformer}}
[[Image:AirMotionTransformer.png|right|thumb|300px|In Heil's air motion transducer, current through the membrane 2 causes it to move left and right in magnetic field 6, moving air in and out along directions 8; barriers 4 prevent air from moving in unintended directions.]]
[[Oskar Heil]] invented the air motion transducer in the 1960s. In this approach, a pleated diaphragm is mounted in a magnetic field and forced to close and open under control of a music signal. Air is forced from between the pleats in accordance with the imposed signal, generating sound. The drivers are less fragile than ribbons and considerably more efficient (and able to produce higher absolute output levels) than ribbon, electrostatic, or planar magnetic tweeter designs. ESS, a California manufacturer, licensed the design, employed Heil, and produced a range of speaker systems using his tweeters during the 1970s and 1980s. [[Lafayette Radio]], a large US retail store chain, also sold speaker systems using such tweeters for a time. There are several manufacturers of these drivers (at least two in Germany—one of which produces a range of high-end professional speakers using tweeters and mid-range drivers based on the technology) and the drivers are increasingly used in professional audio. Martin Logan produces several AMT speakers in the US and GoldenEar Technologies incorporates them in its entire speaker line.

====Transparent ionic conduction speaker====
In 2013, a research team introduced Transparent ionic conduction speaker which a 2 layers transparent conductive gel and a layer of transparent rubber in between to make high voltage and high actuation work to reproduce good sound quality. The speaker is suitable for robotics, mobile computing and adaptive optics fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/08/30/transparent-gel-speaker-ionic-conduction/#continued |title=Transparent gel speaker plays music through the magic of ionic conduction (video) |date=August 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Without a diaphragm===

====Plasma arc speakers====
{{Main article|Plasma speaker}}
[[File:Moeller Plasma.jpg|thumb|Plasma speaker]]
[[Plasma arc loudspeaker]]s use electrical [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] as a radiating element. Since plasma has minimal mass, but is charged and therefore can be manipulated by an [[electric field]], the result is a very linear output at frequencies far higher than the audible range. Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the [[Plasmatronics]] Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from [[helium]] gas.&lt;ref name=nutshellhifi&gt;[http://www.nutshellhifi.com/library/speaker-design1.html Hill Plasmatronics] described. Retrieved March 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This avoided the [[ozone]] and [[nitrous oxide]]&lt;ref name=nutshellhifi/&gt; produced by [[Radio frequency|RF]] decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s. Currently, there remain a few manufacturers in Germany who use this design, and a do-it-yourself design has been published and has been available on the Internet.

A less expensive variation on this theme is the use of a flame for the driver, as flames contain ionized (electrically charged) gases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/feb98/888372043.Ot.r.html|title=Re: COULD YOU PLEASE FIND RESEARCH RE:SOUND REPRODUTION VIA GAS FLAME &amp; ELECTRI|author=|date=|website=www.madsci.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

====Thermoacoustic speakers====
In 2008, researchers of Tsinghua University demonstrated a thermoacoustic loudspeaker of [[carbon nanotube]] thin film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Xiao|first=Lin|author2=Kaili Jiang |title=Flexible, Stretchable, Transparent Carbon Nanotube Thin Film Loudspeakers|journal=Nano Letters|year=2008|volume=8|issue=12|pages=4539–4545|doi=10.1021/nl802750z|pmid=19367976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  whose working mechanism is a thermoacoustic effect. Sound frequency electric currents are used to periodically heat the CNT and thus result in sound generation in the surrounding air. The CNT thin film loudspeaker is transparent, stretchable and flexible.
In 2013, researchers of Tsinghua University further present a thermoacoustic earphone of carbon nanotube thin yarn and a thermoacoustic surface-mounted device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wei|first=Yang|author2=Xiaoyang Lin |title=Thermoacoustic Chips with Carbon Nanotube Thin Yarn Arrays|journal=Nano Letters|year=2013|doi=10.1021/nl402408j|pmid=24041369|volume=13|issue=10|pages=4795–801}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are both fully integrated devices and compatible with Si-based semiconducting technology.

====Rotary woofers====

A [[rotary woofer]] is essentially a fan with blades that constantly change their pitch, allowing them to easily push the air back and forth.  Rotary woofers are able to efficiently reproduce [[infrasound]] frequencies, which are difficult to impossible to achieve on a traditional speaker with a diaphragm.  They are often employed in movie theaters to recreate rumbling bass effects, such as explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iar-80.com/page142.html|title=Eminent Technology TRW-17 Subwoofer Part I: The Only Subwoofer|website=International Audio/Video Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Guttenberg|first1=Steve|title=World's most amazing subwoofer has no woofer|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/worlds-most-amazing-subwoofer-has-no-woofer/|website=Cnet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New technologies ===

====Digital speakers====
{{Main article|Digital speaker}}

[[Digital speakers]] have been the subject of experiments performed by [[Bell Labs]] as far back as the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} The design is simple; each [[bit]] controls a driver, which is either fully 'on' or 'off'. Problems with this design have led manufacturers to abandon it as impractical for the present. First, for a reasonable number of bits (required for adequate [[Sound recording and reproduction|sound reproduction]] quality), the physical size of a speaker system becomes very large. Secondly, due to inherent [[analog digital conversion]] problems, the effect of [[aliasing]] is unavoidable, so that the audio output is "reflected" at equal amplitude in the frequency domain, on the other side of the [[sampling frequency]], causing an unacceptably high level of [[ultrasound|ultrasonic]]s to accompany the desired output. No workable scheme has been found to adequately deal with this.

The term "digital" or "digital-ready" is often used for marketing purposes on speakers or [[headphones]], but these systems are not digital in the sense described above. Rather, they are conventional speakers that can be used with digital sound sources (e.g., [[optical media]], [[MP3]] players, etc.), as can any conventional speaker.

It often is [[Politics|political]] or [[Art manifesto|artistic]] in nature, but may present an individual's [[life stance]]. Manifestos relating to [[religious belief]] are generally referred to as [[creed]]s.

== Etymology ==

It is derived from the [[Italian language|Italian]] word ''manifesto'', itself derived from the [[Latin]] ''manifestum'', meaning clear or conspicuous. Its first recorded use in English is from 1620, in [[Nathaniel Brent]]'s translation of [[Paolo Sarpi]]'s ''History of the Council of Trent'': "To this citation he made answer by a Manifesto" (p.&amp;nbsp;102). Similarly, "They were so farre surprised with his Manifesto, that they would never suffer it to be published''" (p.&amp;nbsp;103).&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational manifestos are documents proposing a change or changes to a current education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thekeysupport.com/insights/2017/05/20/manifesto-summaries-what-do-they-say-about-education/|title=Manifesto summaries: what do they say about education? {{!}} The Key|last=Edwards|first=Mark|date=2017-05-20|work=The Key|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2018}} They can be written by governing bodies, organizations, or individuals involved in education as parents, student, administrators, or other stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coe.int/en/web/education|title=Better Education for better Democracies|website=Education|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Specify|reason=This just goes to a homepage|date=May 2018}} The writer or writers are positioned as a minority group, with manifestos aimed at a majority group. Educational manifestos include personal or group beliefs about what is important or right in education, make statements about the current state of education, differentiate common terms in education, and make suggestions for changing current education systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://davinebanks.com/teaching/|title=A Teaching Manifesto - DAVIN EBANKS|work=DAVIN EBANKS|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} 

They can often include observations about society and whether or not students are prepared to participate fully in it when they are finished with mandatory schooling.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetattooedprof.com/2016/07/06/radical-hope-a-teaching-manifesto/|title=Radical Hope: A Teaching Manifesto|date=2016-07-06|work=The Tattooed Professor|access-date=2018-04-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}} These observations can include a perceived misalignment between mandatory school and society, an unjust, unfair, or right aspect of education, or perceived lack of personalization in learning. Other topics that are frequently addressed in educational manifestos include curriculum, funding, personalization, class size, teacher burnout, and standardized testing, among others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Self-published source|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17344">In [[physics]] and [[cosmology]], the '''mathematical universe hypothesis''' ('''MUH'''), also known as the '''ultimate ensemble theory''', is a speculative "[[theory of everything]]" (TOE) proposed by cosmologist [[Max Tegmark]].&lt;ref name="Tegmark1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegmark |first=Max |date=November 1998 |title=Is "the Theory of Everything" Merely the Ultimate Ensemble Theory? |journal=Annals of Physics |volume=270 |issue=1 |pages=1–51 |doi=10.1006/aphy.1998.5855 |arxiv = gr-qc/9704009 |bibcode = 1998AnPhy.270....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Tegmark 2014, "[http://mathematicaluniverse.org Our Mathematical Universe]", Knopf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Tegmark's MUH is: ''Our external physical reality is a mathematical structure''.&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tegmark |first=Max |date=February 2008 |title=The Mathematical Universe |journal=Foundations of Physics |volume=38 |issue=2 |pages=101–150 |doi=10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9 |arxiv=0704.0646|bibcode = 2008FoPh...38..101T }}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, the physical universe is not merely ''described by'' mathematics, but ''is'' mathematics (specifically, a [[mathematical structure]]).  Mathematical existence equals physical existence, and all structures that exist mathematically exist physically as well.  Observers, including humans, are "self-aware substructures (SASs)".  In any mathematical structure complex enough to contain such substructures, they "will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically 'real' world".&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory can be considered a form of [[Pythagoreanism]] or [[Platonism]] in that it proposes the existence of mathematical entities; a form of [[philosophy of mathematics|mathematical monism]] in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects; and a formal expression of [[Structuralism (philosophy of science)|ontic structural realism]].

Tegmark claims that the hypothesis has no free parameters and is not observationally ruled out. Thus, he reasons, it is preferred over other theories-of-everything by [[Occam's Razor]].  Tegmark also considers augmenting the MUH with a second assumption, the '''computable universe hypothesis''' ('''CUH'''), which says that the mathematical structure that is our external physical reality is defined by [[computable function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|arxiv=0704.0646|title= The Mathematical Universe|journal= Foundations of Physics|volume= 38|issue= 2|pages= 101–150|publisher=|last1= Tegmark|first1= Max|year= 2007|doi= 10.1007/s10701-007-9186-9|bibcode= 2008FoPh...38..101T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MUH is related to Tegmark's categorization of four levels of the [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name="Tegmark2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tegmark |first=Max |editor=Barrow, J.D. |editor2=Davies, P.C.W. |editor3=Harper, C.L. |year=2003 |title="Science and Ultimate Reality: From Quantum to Cosmos" honoring John Wheeler's 90th birthday |chapter=Parallel Universes |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |arxiv=astro-ph/0302131|bibcode=2003SciAm.288e..40T |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0503-40 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This categorization posits a nested hierarchy of increasing diversity, with worlds corresponding to different sets of [[initial conditions]] (level 1), [[physical constants]] (level 2), quantum branches (level 3), and altogether different equations or mathematical structures (level 4).

==Reception==

[[Andreas Albrecht (cosmologist)|Andreas Albrecht]] of [[Imperial College]] in London, called it a "provocative" solution to one of the central problems facing physics. Although he "wouldn't dare" go so far as to say he believes it, he noted that "it's actually quite difficult to construct a theory where everything we see is all there is".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chown |first=Markus |authorlink = Marcus Chown|date=June 1998 |title=Anything goes |journal=[[New Scientist]] |volume=158 |issue=2157 |url=http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/toe_press.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms and responses==

===Definition of the ensemble===
[[Jürgen Schmidhuber]]&lt;ref name="AToE"&gt;[[Jürgen Schmidhuber|J. Schmidhuber]] (2000) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122 Algorithmic Theories of Everything.]"&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "Although Tegmark suggests that '... all mathematical structures are a priori given equal statistical weight,' there is no way of assigning equal non-vanishing probability to all (infinitely many) mathematical structures." Schmidhuber puts forward a more restricted ensemble which admits only universe representations describable by [[constructive mathematics]], that is, [[computer program]]s. He explicitly includes universe representations describable by non-halting programs whose output bits converge after finite time, although the convergence time itself may not be predictable by a halting program, due to the [[Undecidable problem|undecidability]] of the [[halting problem]].&lt;ref name="AToE"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidhuber | first1 = J. | authorlink = Jürgen Schmidhuber | year = 2002 | title = Hierarchies of generalized Kolmogorov complexities and nonenumerable universal measures computable in the limit | url = http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/kolmogorov.html | journal = International Journal of Foundations of Computer Science | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 587–612 | doi=10.1142/S0129054102001291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Tegmark notes&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008" /&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=formatting error--look at result in list--it doesn't show up, but has a warning|date=January 2017}} (sec. V.E) that the measure over all universes has not yet been constructed for the [[string theory landscape]] either, so this should not be regarded as a "show-stopper".

===Consistency with Gödel's theorem===
{{See also|Consistency|Gödel's completeness theorem}}
It has also been suggested that the MUH is inconsistent with [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem]]. In a three-way debate between Tegmark and fellow physicists [[Piet Hut]] and Mark Alford,&lt;ref name='HAT'&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hut | first1 = P. | last2 = Alford | first2 = M. | last3 = Tegmark | first3 = M. | year = 2006 | title = On Math, Matter and Mind | journal = Foundations of Physics | volume = 36 | issue = 6| pages = 765–94 |arxiv = physics/0510188 |bibcode = 2006FoPh...36..765H |doi = 10.1007/s10701-006-9048-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "secularist" (Alford) states that "the methods allowed by formalists cannot prove all the theorems in a sufficiently powerful system... The idea that math is 'out there' is incompatible with the idea that it consists of formal systems."

Tegmark's response in&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; (sec VI.A.1) is to offer a new hypothesis "that only Gödel-complete ([[Decidability (logic)|fully decidable]]) mathematical structures have physical existence. This drastically shrinks the Level IV multiverse, essentially placing an upper limit on complexity, and may have the attractive side effect of explaining the relative simplicity of our universe." Tegmark goes on to note that although conventional theories in physics are Gödel-undecidable, the actual mathematical structure describing our world could still be Gödel-complete, and "could in principle contain observers capable of thinking about Gödel-incomplete mathematics, just as [[Turing machine|finite-state digital computers]] can prove certain theorems about Gödel-incomplete formal systems like [[Peano arithmetic]]." In&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"/&gt; (sec. VII) he gives a more detailed response, proposing as an alternative to MUH the more restricted "Computable Universe Hypothesis" (CUH) which only includes mathematical structures that are simple enough that Gödel's theorem does not require them to contain any undecidable or uncomputable theorems. Tegmark admits that this approach faces "serious challenges", including (a) it excludes much of the mathematical landscape; (b) the measure on the space of allowed theories may itself be uncomputable; and (c) "virtually all historically successful theories of physics violate the CUH".

===Observability===
Stoeger, Ellis, and Kircher&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Stoeger, [[George F. R. Ellis|G. F. R. Ellis]], U. Kirchner (2006) "[https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0407329 Multiverses and Cosmology: Philosophical Issues.]"&lt;/ref&gt; (sec. 7) note that in a true multiverse theory, "the universes are then completely disjoint and nothing that happens in any one of them is causally linked to what happens in any other one. This lack of any causal connection in such multiverses really places them beyond any scientific support". Ellis&lt;ref&gt;G.F.R. Ellis, "83 years of general relativity and cosmology: Progress and problems", Class. Quantum Grav. 16, A37-A75, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; (p29) specifically criticizes the MUH, stating that an infinite ensemble of completely disconnected universes is "completely untestable, despite hopeful remarks sometimes made, see, e.g., Tegmark (1998)."
Tegmark maintains that MUH is [[testable]], stating that it predicts (a) that "physics research will uncover mathematical regularities in nature", and (b) by assuming that we occupy a typical member of the multiverse of mathematical structures, one could "start testing multiverse predictions by assessing how typical our universe is" (&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"/&gt; sec. VIII.C).

===Plausibility of radical Platonism===
{{See also|Philosophy of mathematics#Mathematicism}}
The MUH is based on the Radical Platonist view that math is an external reality (&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"/&gt; sec V.C). However, Jannes&lt;ref name="Jannes2009"&gt;Gil Jannes, "Some comments on 'The Mathematical Universe'", Found. Phys. 39, 397-406, 2009 [https://arxiv.org/abs/0904.0867 arXiv:0904.0867]&lt;/ref&gt; argues that "mathematics is at least in part a human construction", on the basis that if it is an external reality, then it should be found in some other [[animals]] as well: "Tegmark argues that, if we want to give a complete description of reality, then we will need a language independent of us humans, understandable for non-human sentient entities, such as aliens and future supercomputers". [[Brian Greene]] (&lt;ref&gt;B. Greene 2011, "[https://www.amazon.com/The-Hidden-Reality-Parallel-Universes/dp/0307278123 ''[[The Hidden Reality]]'' ]"&lt;/ref&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;299) argues similarly: "The deepest description of the universe should not require concepts whose meaning relies on human  experience or interpretation. Reality transcends our existence and so shouldn't, in any fundamental way, depend on ideas of our making."

However, there are many non-human entities, plenty of which are intelligent, and many of which can apprehend, memorise, compare and even approximately add numerical quantities. Several animals have also passed the [[Mirror test|mirror test of self-consciousness]]. But a few surprising examples of mathematical abstraction notwithstanding (for example, chimpanzees can be trained to carry out symbolic addition with digits, or the report of a parrot understanding a “zero-like concept”), all examples of [[animal intelligence]] with respect to mathematics are limited to basic counting abilities. He adds, "non-human intelligent beings should exist that understand the language of advanced mathematics. However, none of the non-human intelligent beings that we know of confirm the status of (advanced) mathematics as an objective language." In the paper "On Math, Matter and Mind"&lt;ref name="HAT"/&gt; the secularist viewpoint examined argues (sec. VI.A) that math is evolving over time, there is "no reason to think it is converging to a definite structure, with fixed questions and established ways to address them", and also that "The Radical Platonist position is just another metaphysical theory like solipsism... In the end the metaphysics just demands that we use a different language for saying what we already knew."  Tegmark responds (sec VI.A.1) that "The notion of a mathematical structure is rigorously defined in any book on [[Model Theory]]", and that non-human mathematics would only differ from our own "because we are uncovering a different part of what is in fact a consistent and unified picture, so math is converging in this sense." In his 2014 book on the MUH,&lt;ref&gt;M. Tegmark 2014, "[http://mathematicaluniverse.org Our Mathematical Universe]"&lt;/ref&gt; Tegmark argues that the resolution is not that we invent the language of mathematics, but that we discover the structure of mathematics.

===Coexistence of all mathematical structures===
[[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] has argued&lt;ref&gt;D. Page, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0610101 Predictions and Tests of Multiverse Theories.]"&lt;/ref&gt; (sec 4) that "At the ultimate level, there can be only one world and, if mathematical structures are broad enough to include all possible worlds or at least our own, there must be one unique mathematical structure that describes ultimate reality. So I think it is logical nonsense to talk of Level 4 in the sense of the co-existence of all mathematical structures." Tegmark responds (&lt;ref name="Tegmark2008"/&gt; sec. V.E) that "this is less inconsistent with Level IV than it may sound, since many mathematical structures decompose into unrelated substructures, and separate ones can be unified."

===Consistency with our "simple universe"===
[[Alexander Vilenkin]] comments&lt;ref name="Vilenkin2006"&gt;A. Vilenkin (2006) ''Many Worlds in One: The Search for Other Universes''. Hill and Wang, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (Ch. 19, p.&amp;nbsp;203) that "the number of mathematical structures increases with increasing complexity, suggesting that 'typical' structures should be horrendously large and cumbersome. This seems to be in conflict with the beauty and simplicity of the theories describing our world". He goes on to note (footnote 8, p.&amp;nbsp;222) that Tegmark's solution to this problem, the assigning of lower "weights" to the more complex structures (&lt;ref name="Tegmark2003"/&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=formatting error--look at result in list--it doesn't show up, but has a warning|date=January 2017}} sec. V.B) seems arbitrary ("Who determines the weights?") and may not be logically consistent ("It seems to introduce an additional mathematical structure, but all of them are supposed to be already included in the set").

===Occam's razor===
Tegmark has been criticized as misunderstanding the nature and application of [[Occam's razor]]; [[Massimo Pigliucci]] reminds that "Occam's razor is just a useful [[heuristic]], it should never be used as the final arbiter to decide which theory is to be favored".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science20.com/rationally_speaking/mathematical_universe_i_ain%E2%80%99t_convinced-127841|title=Mathematical Universe?

The '''Meat Research Institute''' was a research institute in [[North Somerset]]. It was founded in 1967 to provide research for the British [[meat industry]].

==History==
In the late 1950s there was a need in the UK for a meat research institute, but no further plans. In March 1962 there was a meeting with thirty one meat producers and representatives from the government and it was decided to build a meat research institute, costing around £500,000 and annual running costs of around £100,000.&lt;ref&gt;''Times, Monday 26 March 1952, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; The first director was appointed in February 1963, before the building construction had begun, who came from the [[Low Temperature Research Station]] in [[Cambridge]]. It was decided to put the research institute next to the veterinary school. Planning permission for the site was issued in May 1963.

To pay for the cost of the institute, the government put a levy on livestock, later administered by the [[Meat and Livestock Commission]]. In October 1966, a new £1m Food Research Institute was announced to be built at Norwich, similarly next to the [[University of East Anglia|university]]. The institute in Somerset was hoped to open in the autumn of 1967. In November 1967 staff moved in.

The [[Elizabeth II|Queen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frperc.com/FRPERC.com/MRI_Archive/Entries/2009/4/16_Dates.html Opening]&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Duke of Northumberland]] and [[Henry Somerset, 10th Duke of Beaufort]], officially opened the new institute on 19 April 1968,&lt;ref&gt;''Times'', Saturday 20 April 1968, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; also opening new buildings of the veterinary school next door. Buglers played ''[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]''.

It became part of the IFR in [[Norfolk]] in 1985, when merged with the [[National Institute for Research in Dairying]], which is now the [[Quadram Institute Bioscience]]. In 1990 the government decided to stop funding to the research institute, and the research institute closed in December 1990.

==Structure==
It was at [[Lower Langford]] in [[North Somerset]]. It was situated next to the Langford House School of Veterinary Science, on the B3133 (for [[Congresbury]]), north of the [[A38 road|A38]].

'''Mehdi Rajabian''' ({{lang-fa|مهدی رجبیان}}; born October 1989)
is an Iranian composer, musician and the founder of the website [[Barg Music|Barg music]]. He was imprisoned for pursuing illegal musical activities in 2015.

==Personal life==
He learnt the hierarchies of the Iranian music during a few years commencing the learning from the masters of the traditional music and recorded and played several albums, e.g. "[[History of Iran Narrated by Setar|Research Album of the History of Iran narrated by Setar]]" as the sitarist, composer and producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freemuse.org/archives/11823|title=Iran:  Two musicians and a filmmaker sentenced|website=Freemuse|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828030311/https://freemuse.org/archives/11823|archivedate=28 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2015/12/mehdi-rajabian/|title=Underground Music Distributors Await Appeal Decision for Six Years in Prison|website=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2016/03/iranian-music-distributors-sentenced/|title=Iranian Music Distributors Sentenced to Three Years in Prison|website=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also worked as the sound recordist and the sound recording director in the several music albums. Rajabian was also a student in relation with his professional music activity; after he was arrested in 2013, he was ceased on continuing education in this field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/03/iran-tortured-filmmaker-and-musicians-face-imminent-arrest-amid-crackdown-on-artists/|title=Iran: Tortured filmmaker and musicians face imminent arrest amid crackdown on artists|website=www.amnesty.org|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voiceproject.org/takeaction/iran-music-is-not-a-crime/|title=Iran: Music Is Not A Crime – Voice Project|website=Voice Project|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://freerajabian.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities and arrest==
Mehdi Rajabian officially participated and monitored the quality of the publication and the music composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2013/12/bargmusic/|title=IRGC Forces Arrest Music Distributors, Pressure Them to Confess on Television|website=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran|language=en-us|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested by Iranian security forces on 5 October 2013 in his office and transferred to Ward 2A of [[Evin Prison]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.iranwire.com/features/6959/|title=Artists Sentenced to Prison|website=en.iranwire.com|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2013/12/bargmusic/&lt;/ref&gt; and each one was sentenced more than two months in solitary confinement,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hra-news.org/en/3-artists-sentenced-imprisonment-fine-appeal-court-tehran|title=3 Artists Sentenced to Imprisonment and Fine by the Appeal Court of Tehran|website=Hrana – News Agancy|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.iranhumanrights.org/2015/12/mehdi-rajabian/&lt;/ref&gt; while this arrest ceased his personal project.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.iranwire.com/features/6959/&lt;/ref&gt; When Mehdi Rajabian was arrested, he was recording "Research Album of History of Iran narrated by Setar", his personal studio, all recordings, hard drives of recorded music were confiscated and the project became silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/24/filmmaker-two-musicians-three-years-prison-iran|title=Film-maker and two musicians face three years prison in Iran|last=Dehghan|first=Saeed Kamali|date=24 March 2016|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://freemuse.org/archives/11823|title=Iran:  Two musicians and a filmmaker sentenced|website=Freemuse|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828030311/https://freemuse.org/archives/11823|archivedate=28 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Imprisonment and Hunger Strike ==
Mehdi Rajabian was imprisoned in the ward 7 of [[Evin Prison]] in [[Tehran]], but after a contentious struggle with the judicial officer of the prison was sent to the ward 8 for punishment. After 10 months of the period of imprisonment, he went on a [[hunger strike]] to protest against the unjust trial, lack of medical facilities in prison, and his transfer to the ward 8 isolating him from his brother. After 14 days of strike, he called off his strike by the interference of the official representative of the prosecutor sent to the prison as an intermediary. However, he published an open letter addressing the judicial authorities of Iran, could attract the supports of the artists of the world by a 30-day hunger strike, and convince the judicial authorities to give him medical leave for the treatment of diseases arising out of hunger strike.

The '''Mycenaean chamber tomb''' is the type of [[chamber tomb]] that was built by ancient [[Mycenaeans]]. This form of mortuary architecture was in use in the Late [[Bronze Age]] in the areas under the cultural influence of the [[Aegean civilization|Aegean]].  

The tombs are cut from rock and have a tripartite structure (chamber, ''stomion'' and ''dromos''), often with additional niches and side chambers in which primary or secondary burials took place. Extensive cemeteries have been found in every part of Greece having [[Mycenae]]an influences, including the islands. Such tombs were also built in parts of ancient [[Anatolia]]. For about 500 years from 1600 BC to 1100 BC they were the most widespread of mortuary structures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2510">'''The National Centre for e-Social Science''' (NCeSS) was a [[UK]] based centre which aimed to promote [[e-Social Science]].  It was founded circa 2003 with funding from the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC) to investigate how innovative and powerful computer-based infrastructure and tools developed over the previous three years under the UK e-Science programme could benefit [[social science]]. The foundation of much of the work was the use of computational infrastructure that was collaboratively provisioned and worked across organisational boundaries. Collaboration was key and the computational approach was commonly known as '[[Grid Computing]]'.

e-Social Science refers to the use of enhanced computer and information technology infrastructure and tools for social science. The role of NCeSS was to investigate specific applications of e-Social Science, develop tools to support them and to advise on the future strategic direction of [[e-Social Science]] and [[e-Science]] more generally. NCeSS also provided information, training, advice, support and on-line resources to help the social science research community adopt e-Social Science approaches. NCeSS developed a portal based e-Infrastructure based on [https://sakaiproject.org/ Sakai] to support e-Social Science, but it was short lived due to lack of resources for sustaining it.

NCeSS was coordinated from the [[University of Manchester]], and involved groups from various other UK universities. The NCeSS research programme included applications of [[e-Science]] in both quantitative and qualitative social sciences, and studies of issues relevant to promoting the wider adoption of [[e-Science]].

NCeSS gradually stopped functioning and the NCeSS Sakai Portal went off line in around 2011.

By 2015, little remains online to indicate that NCeSS ever existed, but the Internet Archive Way Back Machine captured something of the Web Site that once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Opus Anglicanum''' or '''English work''' is fine [[needlework]] of [[Medieval England]] done for ecclesiastical or secular use on [[clothing]], hangings or other [[textiles]], often using gold and silver threads on rich velvet or linen grounds. Such English embroidery was in great demand across Europe, particularly from the late 12th to mid-14th centuries and was a luxury product often used for diplomatic gifts.

==Uses==
Most of the surviving examples of Opus Anglicanum were designed for liturgical use.  These exquisite and expensive [[embroidery]] pieces were often made as [[vestment]]s, such as [[cope]]s, [[chasuble]]s and [[orphrey]]s, or else as [[antependium|antependia]], shrine covers or other church furnishings. Secular examples, now known mostly just from contemporary inventories, included various types of garments, horse-trappings, book covers and decorative hangings.

==Manufacture==
Opus Anglicanum was usually [[embroidery|embroidered]] on [[linen]] or, later,  [[velvet]], in [[Backstitch|split stitch]] and [[couching (embroidery)|couching]] with [[silk]] and [[gold]] or [[goldwork (embroidery)|silver-gilt thread]].&lt;ref&gt;Levey, S. M. and D. King, ''The Victoria and Albert Museum's Textile Collection Vol. 3: Embroidery in Britain from 1200 to 1750'', Victoria and Albert Museum, 1993, {{ISBN|1-85177-126-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gold-wound thread, pearls and jewels are all mentioned in inventory descriptions.
Although often associated with nunneries, by the time of [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] (reg. 1216–72), who purchased a number of items for use within his own court and for [[diplomatic gift|diplomatic gifting]], the bulk of production was in lay workshops, mainly centred on London. The names of various (male) embroiderers of the period appear in the [[Pipe Rolls|Westminster royal accounts]].&lt;ref&gt;Article: Opus Anglicanum, ''Grove Dictionary of Art'', Oxford, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
[[File:Butlerbowden cope.jpg|thumb|right|500px|[[The Butler-Bowden Cope]], 1330–50, V&amp;A Museum]]

English needlework had become famous across Europe during the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] period (though very few examples survive) and remained so throughout the Gothic era.  A Vatican inventory of 1295  lists over 113 pieces from England, more than from any other country;&lt;ref&gt;Remnant 1964:111; Bonnie Young, "Opus Anglicanum" ''The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin'', New Series, '''29'''.7 (March 1971:291–298) p. 291; the article was occasioned by an exhibition at The Cloisters.&lt;/ref&gt; a request by [[Pope Innocent IV]], who had envied the gold-embroidered [[cope]]s and mitres of English priests, that Cistercian religious houses send more is reported  by the Benedictine [[chronicle]]r [[Matthew Paris]] of [[St Albans]]: "This command of my Lord Pope did not displease the London merchants who traded in these embroideries and sold them at their own price."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted Young 1971:291.&lt;/ref&gt; The high water mark of style and refinement is normally considered to have been reached in the work of the 13th and early 14th centuries. An influential exhibition at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] from September–November 1963 displayed several examples of Opus Anglicanum from this period alongside contemporary works of wood and stone sculpture, metalwork and ivories.&lt;ref&gt;King, David (ed), ''Opus Anglicanum'' (exhibition catalogue), London, V&amp;A Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Survival rates for Opus Anglicanum are low (especially for secular works) as is clear from comparing the large number listed in contemporary inventories with the handful of examples still existing. Sometimes ecclesiastical garments were later modified for different uses, such as altar coverings or book covers. Others were buried with their owners, as with the vestments of the mid-13th century Bishops, [[Walter de Cantilupe]] and [[William de Blois (bishop of Worcester)|William de Blois]], fragments of which were recovered when their tombs in [[Worcester Cathedral]] were opened in the 18th century. The majority however were lost to neglect, destroyed by [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] or else unpicked or burnt to recover the precious metals from the gold and silver threads.
Although fragmentary examples can be found in a number of museums, the most important specialised collections of Opus Anglicanum garments are at the [[Cloisters Museum]] in New York, the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London and in the Treasury of [[Sens Cathedral]].

Only a few [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] pieces have survived, including three pieces at [[Durham, England|Durham]] that had been placed in the coffin of [[St Cuthbert]], probably in the 930s, after being given by [[King Athelstan]]; they were however made in [[Winchester]] between 909 and 916. These are works "of breathtaking brilliance and quality", according to Wilson, including figures of saints, and important early examples of the Winchester style, though the origin of their style is a puzzle; they are closest to a wall-painting fragment from Winchester, and an early example of [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 154–156, quote 155; Dodwell (1993), 26; Golden Age, 19, 44, though neither these nor any textiles could be lent for the exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest group of survivals, now re-arranged and with the precious metal thread mostly picked out, are bands or borders from vestments, incorporating pearls and glass beads, with various types of scroll and animal decoration. These are probably 9th century and now in a church in [[Maaseik]] in Belgium.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 108; Dodwell (1993), 27, who gives details of further fragments.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further style of textile is a vestment illustrated in a miniature portrait of [[Saint Aethelwold]] in [[Benedictional of St. Æthelwold|his Benedictional]], which shows the edge of what appears to be a huge acanthus "flower" (a term used in several documentary records) covering the wearer's back and shoulders.  Other written sources mention other large-scale compositions.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), 183–185; [http://img49.imageshack.us/img49/5295/benedictional1am1.jpg portrait of Saint Aethelwold]&lt;/ref&gt;

One particularly fine example is ''The Adoration of the Magi'' [[chasuble]] from c.&amp;nbsp;1325 in red velvet embroidered in gold thread and pearls at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.  It depicts a [[Nativity of Jesus in art|nativity]] scene with emphasis on decorative motifs, flowers, animals, birds, beasts, and angels.  [[The Butler-Bowden Cope]] at the Victoria and Albert Museum is another surviving example; the same collection has a late cope made for a set of vestments given by [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] to [[Westminster Abbey]].

Percoll consists of [[colloidal]] [[silica]] particles of 15–30&amp;nbsp;nm diameter (23% w/w in water) which have been coated with [[polyvinylpyrrolidone]] (PVP).
Percoll is well suited for density gradient experiments because it possesses a low viscosity compared to alternatives, a low osmolarity, and no toxicity towards cells and their constituents.

Percoll is a registered trademark of [[GE Healthcare]].

== Past use in artificial reproduction ==
Percoll was previously used in [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART) to select [[sperm]] from [[semen]] by density gradient centrifugation, for use in techniques such as [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] or [[intrauterine insemination]]. However, in 1996, [[Pharmacia]] sent out a letter to laboratories stating that Percoll should be used for research purposes only, not clinical. Pharmacia had not marketed it as a sperm preparation product; it had been repackaged and sold as such by third-party manufacturers. The [[FDA Warning Letter]] was due to concerns that PVP might cause damage to sperm (an unknown issue), and also that some batches of Percoll contained high levels of [[endotoxin]] (a known issue). The latter concern also applies to the use of Percoll with any other cells that might be injected back into a patient, since endotoxin can cause severe inflammation and fever. Since then it has been replaced with other [[colloids]] in the ART industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Plant pathology''' (also '''phytopathology''') is the scientific study of [[disease]]s in [[plant]]s caused by [[pathogen]]s (infectious organisms) and environmental conditions (physiological factors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Agrios, George N. |title=Plant Pathology |edition=3rd |publisher=Academic Press |date=1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; Organisms that cause infectious disease include [[fungus|fungi]], [[oomycetes]], [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[plant virus|viruses]], [[viroid]]s, [[virus]]-like organisms, [[phytoplasmas]], [[protozoa]], [[nematode]]s and [[parasitic plant]]s. Not included are ectoparasites like [[insects]], [[mites]], [[vertebrate]], or other [[Plant defense against herbivory|pests that affect plant health]] by consumption of plant tissues. Plant pathology also involves the study of pathogen identification, disease etiology, disease cycles, economic impact, [[plant disease epidemiology]], [[plant disease resistance]], how plant diseases affect humans and animals, pathosystem genetics, and management of plant diseases.

== Overview ==
{{See also|Morphological symptoms of plant diseases}}
Control of plant diseases is crucial to the reliable production of food, and it provides significant reductions in agricultural use of land, water, fuel and other inputs.  Plants in both natural and cultivated populations carry inherent disease resistance, but there are numerous examples of devastating plant disease impacts such as [[Irish potato famine]] and [[chestnut blight]], as well as recurrent severe plant diseases like [[rice blast]], [[soybean cyst nematode]], and [[citrus canker]].  However, disease control is reasonably successful for most crops. Disease control is achieved by use of plants that have been bred for good resistance to many diseases, and by plant cultivation approaches such as [[crop rotation]], use of pathogen-free seed, appropriate planting date and plant density, control of field moisture, and [[pesticide]] use. Across large regions and many crop species, it is estimated that diseases typically reduce plant yields by 10% every year in more developed settings, but yield loss to diseases often exceeds 20% in less developed settings.  Continuing advances in the science of plant pathology are needed to improve disease control, and to keep up with changes in disease pressure caused by the ongoing evolution and movement of plant pathogens and by changes in agricultural practices. Plant diseases cause major economic losses for farmers worldwide. The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] estimates indeed that pests and diseases are responsible for about 25% of crop loss. To solve this issue, new methods are needed to detect diseases and pests early, such as novel sensors that detect plant odours and [[spectroscopy]] and [[biophotonics]] that are able to diagnose plant health and [[metabolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Advanced methods of plant disease detection.

=== Fungi ===
Most phytopathogenic fungi belong to the [[Ascomycetes]] and the [[Basidiomycetes]].
The fungi reproduce both [[sexual reproduction|sexually]] and [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] via the production of [[spores]] and other structures. Spores may be spread long distances by air or water, or they may be soilborne. Many soil inhabiting fungi are capable of living [[saprotroph]]ically, carrying out the part of their life cycle in the [[soil]]. These are facultative saprotrophs.
Fungal diseases may be controlled through the use of [[fungicides]] and other agriculture practices. However, new [[Race (biology)|races]] of fungi often [[evolution|evolve]] that are resistant to various fungicides.
Biotrophic fungal pathogens colonize living plant tissue and obtain nutrients from living host cells. [[Necrotroph]]ic fungal pathogens infect and kill host tissue and extract nutrients from the dead host cells. Significant fungal plant pathogens include:{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Despite not being closely related to the fungi, the oomycetes have developed similar infection strategies. Oomycetes are capable of using effector proteins to turn off a plant's defenses in its infection process.&lt;ref name="enter host cell"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://phys.org/news199007038.html | title=Scientists discover how deadly fungal microbes enter host cells | publisher=Physorg | work=(VBI) at Virginia Tech affiliates | date=July 22, 2010 | accessdate=July 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plant pathologists commonly group them with fungal pathogens.

Significant oomycete plant pathogens include:
* ''[[Pythium]]'' spp.
* ''[[Phytophthora]]'' spp., including the potato blight of the [[Great Irish Famine]] (1845–1849)

==== Phytomyxea ====
Some [[slime mold]]s in [[Phytomyxea]] cause important diseases, including [[club root]] in cabbage and its relatives and [[powdery scab]] in potatoes. These are caused by species of ''[[Plasmodiophora]]'' and ''[[Spongospora]]'', respectively.

=== Bacteria ===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Bacterial Plant Pathogen]] --&gt;
[[File:Agrobacteriumgall.jpg|thumb|Crown gall disease caused by [[Agrobacterium]]|left]]
Most [[bacteria]] that are associated with plants are actually [[saprotrophic]] and do no harm to the plant itself. However, a small number, around 100 known species, are able to cause disease.&lt;ref name=JacksonRW&gt;{{cite book | author=Jackson RW (editor). | title=Plant Pathogenic Bacteria: Genomics and Molecular Biology | publisher=Caister Academic Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-1-904455-37-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacterial diseases are much more prevalent in [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] regions of the world.

Most plant pathogenic bacteria are rod-shaped ([[Bacteria#Morphology|bacilli]]). In order to be able to colonize the plant they have specific pathogenicity factors. Five main types of bacterial pathogenicity factors are known: uses of cell wall–degrading enzymes, [[toxins]], effector proteins, [[phytohormones]] and [[exopolysaccharide]]s.

Pathogens such as ''[[Erwinia]]'' species use cell wall–degrading enzymes to cause [[Bacterial soft rot|soft rot]]. ''[[Agrobacterium]]'' species change the level of [[auxin]]s to cause tumours with phytohormones. [[Exopolysaccharide]]s are produced by bacteria and block [[xylem]] vessels, often leading to the death of the plant.

Bacteria control the production of [[pathogenicity factors]] via [[quorum sensing]].

Significant bacterial plant pathogens:
* [[Burkholderia]]&lt;ref name="abstract bacteria"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Bacteria as Plant Pathogens | publisher=Cornell University | date=October 1948 | author=Burkholder | journal=Annual Review of Microbiology | doi=10.1146/annurev.mi.02.100148.002133 | volume=2 | pages=389–412 | pmid=18104350}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Proteobacteria]]
** ''[[Xanthomonas]]'' spp.
** ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' spp.
* [[Pseudomonas tomato|Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato]] causes tomato plants to produce less fruit, and it "continues to adapt to the tomato by minimizing its recognition by the tomato immune system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Virginia Tech| year=2011| title= Research team unravels tomato pathogen's tricks of the trade| url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2011/11/110311-fralin-tomatopathogen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phytoplasmas and spiroplasmas ====
{{Main|phytoplasma}}
''[[Phytoplasma]]'' and ''[[Spiroplasma]]'' are genera of bacteria that lack cell walls and are related to the [[mycoplasmas]], which are human pathogens. Together they are referred to as the [[mollicutes]]. They also tend to have smaller [[genomes]] than most other bacteria. They are normally transmitted by sap-sucking [[insects]], being transferred into the plant's [[phloem]] where it reproduces.
[[File:Tobacco mosaic virus symptoms tobacco.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tobacco mosaic virus]]]]

=== Viruses, viroids and virus-like organisms ===
{{Main|Plant Virus}}
There are many types of [[plant virus]], and some are even [[asymptomatic]]. Under normal circumstances, plant viruses cause only a loss of [[crop yield]]. Therefore, it is not economically viable to try to control them, the exception being when they infect [[perennial plant|perennial]] species, such as fruit trees.

Most plant viruses have small, single-stranded [[RNA]] [[genome]]s. However some plant viruses also have double stranded [[RNA]] or single or double stranded [[DNA]] genomes. These genomes may encode only three or four [[proteins]]: a [[replicase]], a coat protein, a [[movement protein]], in order to allow cell to cell movement through [[plasmodesmata]], and sometimes a protein that allows transmission by a vector. Plant viruses can have several more proteins and employ many different molecular translation methods.

Plant viruses are generally transmitted from plant to plant by a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]], but mechanical and seed transmission also occur. Vector transmission is often by an [[insect]] (for example, [[aphid]]s), but some [[fungus|fungi]], [[nematode]]s, and [[protozoa]] have been shown to be viral vectors. In many cases, the insect and virus are specific for virus transmission such as the [[beet leafhopper]] that transmits the [[curly top]] virus causing disease in several crop plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Creamer|first=Rebecca |author2=H. Hubble |author3=A. Lewis|title=Curtovirus Infection of Chile Pepper in New Mexico|journal=Plant Diseases|date=May 2005|volume=89|issue=5|pages=480–486|doi=10.1094/PD-89-0480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nematodes ===
{{Main|Nematodes}}
[[File:Nematode nodules.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Root-knot nematode]] galls|left]]
[[Nematodes]] are small, multicellular wormlike animals. Many live freely in the soil, but there are some species that parasitize plant [[root]]s. They are a problem in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions of the world, where they may infect [[crops]]. Potato cyst nematodes (''Globodera pallida'' and ''G. rostochiensis'') are widely distributed in Europe and North and South America and cause {{Nowrap|$300 million}} worth of damage in Europe every year. Root knot nematodes have quite a large host range, they parasitize plant root systems and thus directly affect the uptake of water and nutrients needed for normal plant growth and reproduction,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huynh|first=Bao-Lam|last2=Matthews|first2=William C.|last3=Ehlers|first3=Jeffrey D.|last4=Lucas|first4=Mitchell R.|last5=Santos|first5=Jansen R.

Nematodes are able to cause radical changes in root cells in order to facilitate their lifestyle.

=== Protozoa and algae ===
There are a few examples of plant diseases caused by [[protozoa]] (e.g., ''[[Phytomonas]]'', a [[Kinetoplastida|kinetoplastid]]).&lt;ref&gt;Jankevicius, J.V. et al. [http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0074-02761988000500073&amp;script=sci_arttext Ciclo biológico de ''Phytomonas'' / Biological cycle of ''Phytomonas'']. ''Memórias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz'',  Rio de Janeiro, v. 83, supl. 1, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; They are transmitted as durable [[zoospore]]s that may be able to survive in a resting state in the soil for many years. Further, they can transmit plant [[viruses]]. When the motile zoospores come into contact with a [[root hair]] they produce a plasmodium which invades the [[root]]s.

Some colourless parasitic [[algae]] (e.g., ''[[Cephaleuros]]'') also cause plant diseases.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

=== Parasitic plants ===
Parasitic plants such as [[mistletoe]] and [[Cuscuta|dodder]] are included in the study of phytopathology. Dodder, for example, is used as a conduit either for the transmission of viruses or virus-like agents from a host plant to a plant that is not typically a host or for an agent that is not graft-transmissible.

== Common pathogenic infection methods ==
* '''Cell wall-degrading enzymes''': These are used to break down the plant [[cell wall]] in order to release the nutrients inside.
* '''[[Toxins]]''': These can be non-host-specific, which damage all plants, or host-specific, which cause damage only on a host plant.
* '''Effector proteins''': These can be secreted into the extracellular environment or directly into the host cell, often via the [[Type three secretion system]]. Some effectors are known to suppress host defense processes. This can include: reducing the plants internal signaling mechanisms or reduction of phytochemicals production.&lt;ref name="effector"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newsroom.ucr.edu/2587 | title=How do plants fight disease?

== Physiological plant disorders ==
{{Main|Physiological plant disorders}}

Abiotic disorders can be caused by natural processes such as [[drought]], [[frost]], [[snow]] and [[hail]]; [[flood]]ing and poor drainage; [[Micronutrient deficiency|nutrient deficiency]]; deposition of mineral salts such as [[sodium chloride]] and [[gypsum]]; [[wind]]burn and breakage by storms; and [[wildfire]]s. Similar disorders (usually classed as abiotic) can be caused by human intervention, resulting in [[soil]] compaction, [[pollution]] of air and soil, [[Soil salinity#Salinity due to irrigation|salinisation caused by irrigation]] and road salting, over-application of [[herbicide]]s, clumsy handling (e.g. lawnmower damage to trees), and [[vandalism]].{{cn|date=April 2017}}

{{Further information|Pest control|Antagonism (phytopathology)}}
;Quarantine: A diseased patch of vegetation or individual plants can be isolated from other, healthy growth. Specimens may be destroyed or relocated into a greenhouse for treatment or study. Another option is to avoid the introduction of harmful nonnative organisms by controlling all human traffic and activity (e.g., [[The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service|AQIS]]), although legislation and enforcement are crucial in order to ensure lasting effectiveness.
;Cultural: Farming in some societies is kept on a small scale, tended by peoples whose culture includes farming traditions going back to ancient times. (An example of such traditions would be lifelong training in techniques of plot terracing, weather anticipation and response, fertilization, grafting, seed care, and dedicated gardening.) Plants that are intently monitored often benefit from not only active external protection but also a greater overall vigor. While primitive in the sense of being the most labor-intensive solution by far, where practical or necessary it is more than adequate.
;Plant resistance: Sophisticated agricultural developments now allow growers to choose from among systematically cross-bred species to ensure the greatest hardiness in their crops, as suited for a particular region's pathological profile. Breeding practices have been perfected over centuries, but with the advent of genetic manipulation even finer control of a crop's immunity traits is possible. The engineering of food plants may be less rewarding, however, as higher output is frequently offset by popular suspicion and negative opinion about this "tampering" with nature.
;Chemical: (See: [[pesticide application]]) Many natural and synthetic compounds can be employed to combat the above threats. This method works by directly eliminating disease-causing organisms or curbing their spread; however, it has been shown to have too broad an effect, typically, to be good for the local ecosystem. From an economic standpoint, all but the simplest natural additives may disqualify a product from "organic" status, potentially reducing the value of the yield.
;Biological: [[Crop rotation]] may be an effective means to prevent a parasitic population from becoming well-established, as an organism affecting leaves would be starved when the leafy crop is replaced by a tuberous type, etc. Other means to undermine parasites without attacking them directly may exist.
;Integrated: The use of two or more of these methods in combination offers a higher chance of effectiveness.

'''''Portrait of Queen Henrietta Maria, as St Catherine''''' is a painting by [[Sir Anthony van Dyck]].

==History==
The portrait of [[Henrietta Maria of France|Queen Henrietta Maria]], as [[St. Catherine of Alexandria]] was painted by van Dyck around 1639. She is depicted in a red dress, wearing a coronet and holding a wheel representing the wheel used to torture St [[Catherine of Alexandria]].

There are numerous copies of the portrait, one of which was sold at [[Bonhams]] for £9,000 in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://artsalesindex.artinfo.com/asi/lots/132287 Blouin Art Sales index]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another copy, dated 1649, by Matthew Snelling, is in [[Alnwick Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arcade.nyarc.org/record=b1014500~S7 Frick Art Reference Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rhodes-Livingstone Institute (RLI)''' was the first local anthropological research facility in Africa; it was founded in 1938 under the initial directorship of [[Godfrey Wilson]]. Designed to allow for easier study of the local cultures of [[Northern Rhodesia]], now [[Zambia]], it became the base of operations for a number of leading anthropologists of the time.

The RLI anthropologists have been lauded by some as liberal, anti-racists, furthering the cause of African independence. Among the participating anthropologists at the RLI, In addition to Wilson, were [[Monica Wilson|Monica Hunter Wilson]], [[Max Gluckman]], [[J. Desmond Clark]], [[Elizabeth Colson]], E.L. Epstein, [[J. Clyde Mitchell]], and William Watson.

Others have called attention to what they regard as misguidedness on the part of the RLI anthropologists, stemming from the fact that they were embedded in the colonial system and blind to its reality as a component in dialectic study.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, James. 1999, ''Expectations of Modernity'', Berkeley, LA, London.

'''Soil [[resistivity]]''' is a measure of how much the soil resists the flow of electricity. It is a critical factor in design of systems that rely on passing current through the Earth's surface. An understanding of the soil resistivity and how it varies with depth in the soil is necessary to design the grounding system in an [[electrical substation]], or for lightning conductors. It is needed for design of [[Ground (electricity)|grounding]] (earthing) electrodes for substations and [[High-voltage direct current]] transmission systems. It can also be a useful measure in [[Precision agriculture|agriculture]] as a proxy measurement for moisture content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://pubs.ext.vt.edu/442/442-508/442-508_pdf.pdf|title = Precision Farming Tools: Soil Electrical Conductivity|last =|first =|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date = Jun 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2016-06-09/factory-fresh|title=The future of agriculture|website=The Economist|access-date=2016-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most substations the earth is used to conduct fault current when there are ground faults on the system. In [[single wire earth return]] power transmission systems, the earth itself is used as the path of conduction from the end customers (the power consumers) back to the transmission facility. 
In general there is some value above which the impedance of the earth connection must not rise, and some maximum step voltage which must not be exceeded to avoid endangering people and livestock.

The soil resistivity value is subject to great variation, due to moisture, temperature and chemical content. Typical values are:
* Usual values: from 10 up to 1000 (Ω-m)
* Exceptional values: from 1000 up to 10000 (Ω-m)

The [[SI]] unit of resistivity is the Ohm-meter (Ω-m); in the [[United States]] the Ohm-centimeter (Ω-cm) is often used instead.&lt;ref&gt;	 “IEEE Guide for Measuring Earth Resistivity, Ground Impedance and Earth Surface Potentials of a Ground System”, IEEE Std 81-2012.&lt;/ref&gt; One Ω-m is 100 Ω-cm. Sometimes the [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]], the reciprocal of the resistivity, is quoted instead.

A wide range of typical soil [[resistivity]] values can be found in literature. Military Handbook 419 (MIL-HDBK-419A) contains reference tables and formulae for the resistance of various patterns of rods and wires buried in soil of known resistivity. Being copyright free, these numbers are widely copied, sometimes without acknowledgement.

==Measurement==
Because soil quality may vary greatly with depth and over a wide lateral area, estimation of soil resistivity based on soil classification provide only a rough approximation.  Actual resistivity measurements are required to fully qualify the resistivity and its effects on the overall transmission system.

Several methods of resistivity measurement are frequently employed:

===Wenner method===
[[File:4 pins.jpg|4 pins]]

The Wenner four-pin method, as shown in figure above, is the most commonly used technique for soil resistivity measurements.&lt;ref name=Dias2010&gt;

Using the Wenner method, the apparent soil resistivity value is:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_E=\frac{4\cdot {\pi}\cdot a\cdot R_W}{1+\frac{2\cdot a}{\sqrt{a^2+4\cdot b^2}}-\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+b^2}}}\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name=Andolfato1997&gt;

where

'''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = measured apparent soil resistivity (Ωm)

'''''a''''' = electrode spacing (m)

'''''b''''' = depth of the electrodes (m)

'''''R&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = Wenner resistance measured as "V/I" in Figure (Ω)
If '''''b''''' is small compared to '''''a''''', as is the case of probes penetrating the ground only for a short distance (as normally happens), the previous equation can be reduced to:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_E=2\cdot \pi\cdot a\cdot R_W\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name=Andolfato1997/&gt;

===Schlumberger method===
[[File:Schl 4 pins.jpg|Schl 4 pins]]

In the Schlumberger method&lt;ref name=Dias2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=Voltimum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tutorial/&gt; the distance between the voltages probe is '''''a''''' and the distances from voltages probe and currents probe are '''''c''''' (see figure above).

Using the Schlumberger method, if '''''b''''' is small compared to '''''a''''' and '''''c''''', and '''''c'''''&gt;'''''2a''''', the apparent soil resistivity value is:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_E={\pi}\frac{c\cdot (c+a)}{a}R_S\,&lt;/math&gt;
where

'''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = measured apparent soil resistance (Ωm)

'''''a''''' = electrode spacing (m)

'''''b''''' = depth of the electrodes (m)

'''''c''''' = electrode spacing (m)

'''''R&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = Schlumberger resistance measured as "V/I" in Figure (Ω)

===Conversion between measures using Schlumberger and Wenner===
[[File:Measured volume.jpg|thumb|left|400px|Measured volume]]
The conversion between values measured using the Schlumberger and Wenner methods is possible only in an approximate way.&lt;ref name=Tutorial/&gt; In any cases, for both Wenner and Schlumberger methods the electrode spacing between the currents probe corresponds to the depth of soil investigation and the measured apparent soil resistivity is referred to a soil volume as in the figure.

The current tends to flow near the surface for small probe spacing, whereas more current penetrates deeper into the soil for large spacing. The resistivity measured for a given current probe spacing represents, to a first approximation, the apparent resistivity of the soil to a depth equal to that spacing.

If the apparent soil resistivity measured with Schlumberger method '''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''''' (with the corresponding electrode spacing '''''a&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''''' and '''''c''''') is given, assuming that the soil resistivity refers to a volume as in the figure with '''''a=L/3''''' follows:

:&lt;math&gt;R_W=\frac{\rho_E}{2\cdot \pi\cdot a_W}\,&lt;/math&gt;

with

:&lt;math&gt;a_W=\frac{a_S+2c}{3}\,&lt;/math&gt;

where:

'''''R&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = equivalent Wenner [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] (Ω)

'''''a&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = equivalent electrode spacing with Wenner method (m)

'''''a&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = [[electrode]] spacing between voltages probe with Schlumberger method (m)

'''''c''''' = [[electrode]] spacing between voltages and currents probe with Schlumberger method (m)

If the measured Schlumberger [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] is given, before calculating the apparent soil [[resistivity]]  the following factor must be calculated:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_E={\pi}\frac{c\cdot (c+a_S)}{a_S}R_S\,&lt;/math&gt;

The Wenner method is the most widely used method for measuring soil resistivity for electrical grounding (earthing) purposes. The Schlumberger method was developed to increase the voltage signal for the earlier, less sensitive instruments, by placing the potential probes closer to the current probes.

The soil [[resistivity]] measurements will be affected by existing nearby grounded electrodes. Buried conductive objects in contact with the soil can invalidate readings made by the methods described if they are close enough to alter the test [[Electric current|current]] flow pattern. This is particularly true for large or long objects.

==Soil resistivity variability==

Electrical conduction in soil is essentially electrolytic and for this reason the soil resistivity depends on:
* moisture content
* salt content
* temperature (above the freezing point 0&amp;nbsp;°C)

Because of the variability of soil resistivity, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] standards require that the seasonal variation in resistivity be accounted for in transmission system design.&lt;ref&gt;[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] Std 61936-1 "Power Installations Exceeding 1 kV ac – Part 1: Common Rules" Section 10.3.1 General Clause b.&lt;/ref&gt; Soil resistivity can increase by a factor of 10 or more in very cold temperatures. &lt;ref&gt; IEEE Recommended Practice for Grounding of Industrial and Commercial Power Systems, IEEE Std. 142-1982'', table 7, page 122 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Corrosion==
Soil resistivity is one of the driving factors determining the corrosiveness of soil.  The soil corrosiveness is classified based on soil electrical [[resistivity]] by the [[British Standard]] BS-1377 as follow:

* '''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &gt; 100 Ωm: slightly corrosive
* 50 &lt; '''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &lt; 100 Ωm: moderately corrosive
* 10 &lt; '''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &lt; 50 Ωm: corrosive
* '''''ρ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''''' &lt; 10 Ωm: severe

'''Source Water Protection''' is protecting source water (including water from lakes, rivers and underground aquifers) from overuse and contamination.

Source water protection is part of a [[multi-barrier approach]] to protecting municipal sources of drinking water that was recommended by the Canadian Justice [[Dennis O'Connor (judge)|Dennis O'Connor]] in his Walkerton reports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/about/pubs/walkerton/&lt;/ref&gt; This study was released in 2002 as a response to the [[Walkerton Tragedy]], in which the town of Walkerton, Ontario's drinking water became contaminated with ''[[E. coli]]'' bacteria.

'''Suni or Jalca''' is one of the eight Natural Regions of [[Peru]]. It is located in the [[Andes]] at an altitude between 3,500 and 4,000 metres above sea level. Suni has a dry and cold weather and there are many glacial valleys.

==Flora and fauna==
The flora includes [[gramine]]ous plants and [[shrub]]s such as the taya-taya (''[[Caesalpinia spinosa]]''), the quishuar (''[[Buddleja coriacea]]''), and the cantuta (''[[Cantua buxifolia]]'') which was considered sacred by the Incas.

Even though it is hard for plants to grow because of the weather, people are able to cultivate such crops as [[quinoa]], maca, [[Kañiwa|qañiwa]], [[Vicia faba|broad beans]] and [[ulluco|ulluku]] ''(Ullucus tuberosus)''. 

The main fauna is the [[guinea pig]] and, among numerous other highland birds, the [[Chiguanco thrush]].&lt;ref&gt;Pulgar Vidal, Javier: Geografía del Perú; Las Ocho Regiones Naturales del Perú.

The '''Swiss Centre for Affective Sciences''' (French title 'Centre Interfacultaire en Sciences Affectives' or 'CISA') is an [[interdisciplinary]] research centre based in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="Le Temps article"&gt;{{cite web|title=Le Temps 11th July 2007 |publisher=Le Temps |url=http://www.letemps.ch/template/recherche.asp?page=rechercher&amp;contenuPage=identification&amp;types=search&amp;type=0&amp;artID=211058&amp;rubrique=1%2C2%2C3%2C4%2C5%2C6%2C7%2C8%2C9%2C10%2C11%2C12%2C13%2C15%2C16%2C17%2C18%2C19%2C20%2C21%2C22%2C23%2C24%2C25&amp;liste=precedent |accessdate=2007-11-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124214838/http://www.letemps.ch/template/recherche.asp?page=rechercher |archivedate=24 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 2003, the focus of its research is the emotions or [[affective science]]. It is one of 20 Swiss Government funded NCCR (National Centres for Competence in Research). The centre was headed by Professor [[Klaus Scherer]], is now headed by David Sander, and researches emotions in the areas of [[cognitive neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[archaeology]] and [[affective computing]]. It has project focuses in cognitive appraisal, expression, social and legal regulation, norms and values and [[aesthetic emotions]]. Over 100 researchers from different universities attend in the NCCR Affective Sciences.&lt;ref name="affective-sciences.org"&gt;http://www.affective-sciences.org/home&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss National Centre of Competence in Research tries to train as many new affective young scientists as possible. They have a program devoted to the ''Education and Training Program'' which helps train and prepare researchers in the affective sciences for the future. The goal of ''Education and Training Program'' is to encourage approach towards affective phenomena without losing the punitive profession required for a professional career between disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.affective-sciences.org/teaching-activities&lt;/ref&gt;
There is an annual program called the [[International Summer School in Affective Sciences (ISSAS)]] which is available for young researchers worldwide. The summer school tries to bring together arts and emotions of students using many methods including literature, neuroscience, psychology, and musicology. 

The Centre's main research goals include attempting to understand affective phenomena, such as emotions and motivation, through research and analysis. Affective phenomena are complex and difficult to understand. They are described as intricate events in human behaviour and experience.&lt;ref name="affective-sciences.org"/&gt;

The centre focusses on three parts of emotions: emotions being complicated reactions to our surroundings, emotions as being disruptive and needing conscious control and regulation and emotions as being a regulating force of today’s society. Therefore, individual research projects are organized around three main categories of research relating to these aspects: emotion awareness and elicitation, emotion regulation and the social purposes of emotions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.affective-sciences.org/research-program-overview&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Terrain Contour Matching''', or '''TERCOM''', is a navigation system used primarily by [[cruise missile]]s. It uses a pre-recorded [[Contour line|contour map]] of the terrain that is compared with measurements made during flight by an on-board [[radar altimeter]]. A TERCOM system considerably increases the accuracy of a missile compared with [[inertial navigation system]]s (INS). The increased accuracy allows a TERCOM-equipped missile to fly closer to obstacles and generally lower altitudes, making it harder to detect by ground radar.

== Description ==
{{See also|Digital elevation model}}

===Optical contour matching===
The [[Goodyear Aerospace|Goodyear Aircraft Corporation]] ATRAN (Automatic Terrain Recognition And Navigation) system for the [[MGM-13 Mace]] was the earliest known TERCOM system. In August 1952, [[Air Materiel Command]] initiated the mating of the Goodyear ATRAN with the [[MGM-1 Matador]].  This mating resulted in a production contract in June 1954. ATRAN was difficult to jam and was not range-limited by line-of sight, but its range was restricted by the availability of radar maps. In time, it became possible to construct radar maps from [[topographic map]]s.

Preparation of the maps required the route to be flown by an aircraft. A [[radar]] on the aircraft was set to a fixed angle and made horizontal scans of the land in front. The timing of the return signal indicated the range to the landform and produced an [[amplitude modulated]] (AM) signal. This was sent to a light source and recorded on [[35 mm film]], advancing the film and taking a picture at indicated times. The film could then be processed and copied for use in multiple missiles.

In the missile, a similar radar produced the same signal. A second system scanned the frames of film against a [[photocell]] and produced a similar AM signal. By comparing the points along the scan where the brightness changed rapidly, which could be picked out easily by simple electronics, the system could compare the left-right path of the missile compared with that of the pathfinding aircraft. Errors between the two signals drove corrections in the autopilot needed to bring the missile back onto its programmed flight path.

===Altitude matching===
Modern TERCOM systems use a different concept, based on the altitude of the ground the missile files over and comparing that to measurements made by a radar altimeter. TERCOM "maps" consist of a series of squares of a given size. Using a smaller number of squares saves memory, at the cost of decreasing accuracy. A series of such maps are produced, typically from data from radar mapping satellites. When flying over water, contour maps are replaced by magnetic field maps.

As a radar altimeter measures the distance between the missile and the terrain, not the absolute altitude, the important measure in the data is the change in altitude from square to square. The missile's radar altimeter feeds measurements into a small buffer which periodically "gates" the measurements over a period of time and averages them out to produce a single measurement. The series of such numbers held in the buffer produce a strip of measurements similar to those held in the maps. The series of changes in the buffer is then compared with the values in the map, looking for areas where the changes in altitude are identical. This produces a location and direction. The guidance system can then use this information to correct the flight path of the missile. 

During the flight to the target the accuracy of the system has to be enough only to avoid terrain features. This allows the maps to be relatively low resolution in these areas. Only the portion of the map for the terminal approach has to be higher resolution, and would normally be encoded at the highest resolutions available to the satellite mapping system.

=== TAINS ===

Due to the limited amount of memory available in mass storage devices of the 1960s and 70s, and their slow access times, the amount of terrain data that could be stored in a missile-sized package was far too small to encompass the entire flight. Instead, small patches of terrain information were stored and periodically used to update a conventional [[inertial platform]]. These systems, combining TERCOM and inertial navigation, are sometimes known as '''TAINS''', for TERCOM-Aided Inertial Navigation System.

=== Advantages ===

TERCOM systems have the advantage of offering accuracy that is not based on the length of the flight; an inertial system slowly drifts after a "fix", and its accuracy is lower for longer distances. TERCOM systems receive constant fixes during the flight, and thus do not have any drift. Their absolute accuracy, however, is based on the accuracy of the radar mapping information, which is typically in the range of meters, and the ability of the processor to compare the altimeter data to the map quickly enough as the resolution increases. This generally limits first generation TERCOM systems to targets on the order of hundreds of meters, limiting them to the use of [[nuclear warhead]]s. Use of conventional warheads requires further accuracy, which in turn demands additional terminal guidance systems.

=== Disadvantages ===

One disadvantage of early TERCOM systems was that, due to the limitations of storage and computing systems of the time, the entire route had to be pre-planned, including its launch point. If the missile was launched from an unexpected location or flew too far off-course, it would never fly over the features included in the maps, and become lost. The INS system can help in this regard, allowing it to fly to the general area of the first patch, but gross errors simply cannot be corrected. This made early TERCOM based systems much less flexible than more modern systems like [[GPS]], which can be set to attack any location from any location, and do not require any sort of pre-recorded information which means they can be targeted immediately prior to launch.

The availability of compact fast computers and high-capacity storage, combined with the availability of global [[digital elevation map]]s, has mitigated this problem, as TERCOM data is no longer limited to small patches, and the availability of [[side-looking radar]] allows much larger areas of landscape contour data to be acquired for comparison with the stored contour data.

== Comparison with other guidance systems ==
=== DSMAC ===
{{See also|Automatic target recognition}}
Early cruise missiles did not have the mapping satellites to draw information from, and there were plans to use a TERCOM-like system based on photographs rather than elevations. A series of photographs taken from surveillance aircraft were put into a carousel in the missile, which were selected at timed intervals and imaged using a television camera. Another camera took pictures out of the bottom of the missile, imaged onto a similar display. A computer compared the two displays and attempted to line up areas of high contrast, similar to the [[contrast seeker]]s used in the [[Maverick missile]], and the offsets needed to align the two images could be decoded into a location and heading. However, this system proved to be very slow, and no such system was ever employed operationally, its role being taken up by TERCOM.

The massive improvements in memory and processing power from the 1950s when these scene comparison systems were first invented to the 1980s when TERCOM was widely deployed changed the nature of the problem considerably. Modern systems can store numerous images of a target as seen from different directions, and often the imagery can be calculated using image synthesis techniques. Likewise, the complexity of the live imaging systems has been greatly reduced through the introduction of solid-state technologies like [[Charge-coupled device|CCDs]]. The combination of these technologies produced the '''Digitized Scene-Mapping Area Correlator (DSMAC)'''. DSMAC systems are often combined with TERCOM as a terminal guidance system, allowing point attack with conventional warheads.
{{Main article|Radar imaging}}
MGM-31 [[Pershing II]], [[SS-12 Scaleboard]] Temp-SM and [[OTR-23 Oka]] used an [[active radar homing]] version of DSMAC (digitized correlator unit DCU), which compared radar [[topographic map]]s taken by satellites or aircraft with information received from the onboard active radar regarding target topography, for terminal guidance.

=== Satellite navigation ===
Yet another way to navigate a cruise missile is by using a '''[[satellite positioning system]]''', such as [[GPS]] or [[GLONASS]]. Satellite navigation systems are precise and cheap. Unfortunately, they rely on satellites. If the satellites are interfered with (e.g. destroyed) or if the satellite signal is interfered with (e.g. jammed), the satellite navigation system becomes inoperable. Therefore, the GPS-based (or GLONASS-based) navigation is useful in a conflict with a technologically unsophisticated adversary. On the other hand, to be ready for a conflict with a technologically advanced adversary, one needs missiles equipped with TAINS and DSMAC.

== Missiles that employ TERCOM navigation ==
The cruise missiles that employ a TERCOM system include:
*[[Supersonic Low Altitude Missile]] (early version of TERCOM was slated to be used in this never-built missile)
*[[AGM-86|AGM-86B]] (United States)
*[[AGM-129 ACM]] (United States)
*[[BGM-109 Tomahawk]] (some versions, United States)
*[[C-602]] Anti-ship &amp; Land attack cruise missile (China)
*[[Kh-55]] Granat [[NATO reporting name]] AS-15 Kent (Soviet Union)
*Newer Russian cruise missiles, such as Kh-101 and Kh-555 are likely to have TERCOM navigation, but little information is available about these missiles
*[[C-802]] or YJ-82 [[NATO reporting name]] CSS-N-8 Saccade (China) - it is unclear if this missile employs TERCOM navigation
*[[Hyunmoo III]] (South Korea)
*[[DH-10]] (China)
*[[Babur cruise missile|Babur]] (Pakistan) Land Attack Cruise Missile
*[[Ra'ad ALCM|Ra'ad]] (Pakistan) Air Launched Cruise Missile

{{About|the alleged poisoning|the [[Tito &amp; Tarantula]] album|Tarantism (album)}}
[[File:Lycosa Tarantula.jpg|thumb|''[[Lycosa tarantula]] carrying her offspring'']]
'''Tarantism''' is a form of [[hysteria|hysteric]] behaviour, popularly believed to result from the bite of the [[wolf spider]] ''[[Lycosa tarantula]]'' (distinct from the broad class of spiders also called [[tarantula]]s).
A better candidate cause is ''[[Latrodectus tredecimguttatus]]'', commonly known as the Mediterranean black widow or steppe spider, although no link between such bites and the behaviour of tarantism has ever been demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1968), p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the term historically is used to refer to a [[dancing mania]] - characteristic of southern Italy - which likely had little to do with spider bites. The  [[tarantella]] dance supposedly evolved from this [[therapy]].

==History==
It was originally described in the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Russell (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; The condition was common in southern [[Italy]] during the 16th and 17th centuries. There were strong suggestions that there is no organic cause for the heightened excitability and [[anxiety|restlessness]] that gripped the victims. The stated belief of the time was that victims needed to engage in frenzied [[dancing]] to prevent [[death]] from tarantism. Supposedly a particular kind of dance, called the [[tarantella]], evolved from this [[therapy]]. A prime location for such outbursts was the church at [[Galatina]], particularly at the time of the [[Feast of Saints Peter and Paul]] on 29 June.&lt;ref&gt;Anon (1968), pp. 173-4.&lt;/ref&gt; "The dancing is placed under the sign of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]], whose chapel serves as a "theatre" for the tarantulees' public meetings. The spider seems constantly interchangeable with Saint Paul; the female tarantulees dress as "brides of Saint Paul".&lt;ref&gt;Hanna (2006) p. 29. See Anon (1968), ''passim'', for a more detailed description of this custom.&lt;/ref&gt; As a climax, "the tarantulees, after having danced for a long time, meet together in the chapel of Saint Paul and communally attain the paroxysm of their trance, ... the general and desperate agitation was dominated by the stylised cry of the tarantulees, the 'crisis cry', an ''ahiii'' uttered with various modulations".&lt;ref&gt;Rouget (1985) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Antidotum tarantulae.jpg|thumb|''Antidotum tarantulae'', a curative musical score from Athanasius Kircher (c. 1660)]]
[[Francesco Cancellieri]], in his exhaustive treatise on Tarantism, takes note of semi-scientific, literary, and popular observations, both recent and ancient, giving each similar weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Cancellieri|first=Francesco|authorlink=Francesco Cancellieri|title=Lettera sopra il Tarantismo, l'aria di Roma, e della sua campagna|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FaVdAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA6|year=1817}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes a report that in August 1693, a doctor in Naples had himself bitten by two tarantulas with six witnesses and a notary, but did not suffer the dancing illness. Cancellieri in part attributes this illness not only to the spiders but to the locale, since Tarantism was mainly seen in [[Abruzzo]], [[Apulia]], and [[Calabria]]. He states:
{{quote|Quando uno è punto da questa mal augurata bestia, si fanno cento diverse mosse in un momento. Si piange, si balla, si vomita, si trema, si ride, s'impallidisce, si grida, si sviene, si soffre gran dolore, e finalmente dopo qualche giorno si muore, se uno non è soccorso. Il sudore, e gli antidoti sollevano l'ammalato; ma il sovrano, ed unico rimedio è la Musica
When one is in the hold of this ill-wished beast, one has a hundred different feelings at a time. One cries, dances, vomits, trembles, laughs, pales, cries, faints, and one will suffer great pain, and finally after a few days, if unaided, you die. Sweat and antidotes relieve the sick, but the sovereign and the only remedy is Music.{{sfn|Cancellieri|1817|p=6}}}}

He goes on to describe some specific observations of the malady, typically afflicting peasants, alone or in groups. The malady typically affected peasants on hot summer days, causing indolence. Then he describes how only treatment through dancing music could restore them to vitality; for example:
{{quote|[...] e trovammo il misero contadino oppresso da difficile respirazione, ed osservammo inoltre, che la faccia, e le mani erano incominciate a divenir nere. E perchè il suo male era a tutti noto, si portò la Chitarra, la cui armonìa subito, che da lui fu intesa, cominciò a mover prima li piedi, poco dipoi le gambe. Si reggeva appresso sulle ginocchia. Indi a poco intervallo s'alzò passenggiando. Finalmente fra lo spazio di un quarto d'ora saltava si, che si sollevava ben tre palmi da terra. Sospirava, ma con empito sì grande, che portava terrore a' circostanti; e prima d'un'ora se gli tolse il nero dalle mani, e dal viso, riacquistando il suo natio colore.
[...] and we found the poor peasant oppressed with difficult breathing, and we observed also that the face and hands had started to be become black. And 'cause his illness was known to all, a guitar was brought, whose harmony immediately that he was understood, began first moving the feet, legs shortly afterwards. He stood on his knees. Soon after an interval he arose swaying. Finally, in the space of a quarter of an hour he was leaping, nearly three palms from the ground. Sighed, but with such great impetus, that it terrorised bystanders, and before an hour, the black was gone from his hands and face, and he regained his native colour.{{sfn|Cancellieri|1817|p=11}}}}

==Interpretation and controversy==
John Crompton proposed that ancient [[Bacchanalia|Bacchanalian rites]] that had been suppressed by the [[Roman Senate]] in 186 BC went underground, reappearing under the guise of emergency therapy for bite victims.&lt;ref&gt;Crompton (1954), p. 56f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of tarantism is consistent with [[mass psychogenic illness]].

Although the popular belief persists that tarantism results from a spider bite, it remains scientifically unsubstantiated. Donaldson, Cavanagh, and Rankin (1997)&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that the actual cause or causes of tarantism remain unknown.

==Cultural references==
Many historical and cultural references are associated with this disease and the ensuing "cure" - the [[tarantella]]. It is, for example, a key image in [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House]]'' and the spell "Tarantallegra" from the [[Harry Potter]] series.{{fact|date=May 2014}} It was also mentioned in the novel 39 Clues: Superspecial Outbreak.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13221">'''Texture synthesis''' is the process of [[algorithm]]ically constructing a large [[digital image]] from a small digital sample image by taking advantage of its structural content. It is an object of research in [[computer graphics]] and is used in many fields, amongst others [[digital image editing]], [[3D computer graphics]] and [[Film#Production|post-production of films]].

Texture synthesis can be used to fill in holes in images (as in [[inpainting]]), create large non-repetitive background images and expand small pictures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1281500&amp;picked=prox&amp;cfid=933979594&amp;cftoken=11326769 "SIGGRAPH 2007 course on Example-based Texture Synthesis"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrast with procedural textures==

[[Procedural texture]]s are a related technique which may synthesise textures from scratch with no source material. By contrast, texture synthesis refers to techniques where some source image is being matched or extended.

==Textures==
"[[Texture (computer graphics)|Texture]]" is an ambiguous word and in the context of texture synthesis may have one of the following meanings:
# In common speech, the word "texture" is used as a synonym for "surface structure". Texture has been described by five different properties in the [[perception (psychology)|psychology of perception]]: ''coarseness'', ''contrast'', ''directionality'', ''line-likeness'' and ''roughness'' {{Ref|Tamura}}.
# In [[3D computer graphics]], a texture is a digital image applied to the surface of a three-dimensional model by [[texture mapping]] to give the model a more realistic appearance. Often, the image is a photograph of a "real" texture, such as [[wood grain]].
# In [[image processing]], every digital image composed of repeated elements is called a "texture."

[[Image:Texture spectrum.jpg|thumb|500px|A mix of photographs and generated images, illustrating the texture spectrum]]
Texture can be arranged along a spectrum going from regular to stochastic, connected by a smooth transition:&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/nrt/ "Near-regular Texture Analysis and Manipulation." Yanxi Liu, Wen-Chieh Lin, and James Hays. SIGGRAPH 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Regular textures.''' These textures look like somewhat regular patterns. An example of a structured texture is a stonewall or a floor tiled with paving stones.
* '''Stochastic textures.''' Texture images of stochastic textures look like [[noise#video noise|noise]]: colour dots that are randomly scattered over the image, barely specified by the attributes minimum and maximum brightness and average colour. Many textures look like stochastic textures when viewed from a distance. An example of a stochastic texture is [[roughcast]].
{{-}}

==Goal==
Texture synthesis algorithms are intended to create an ''output image'' that meets the following requirements:
* The output should have the size given by the user.
* The output should be as similar as possible to the sample.
* The output should not have visible artifacts such as seams, blocks and misfitting edges.
* The output should not repeat, i. e. the same structures in the output image should not appear multiple places.
Like most algorithms, texture synthesis should be efficient in computation time and in memory use.

==Methods==
The following methods and algorithms have been researched or developed for texture synthesis:

===Tiling===
The simplest way to generate a large image from a sample image is to [[Repeating texture|tile]] it. This means multiple copies of the sample are simply copied and pasted side by side.  The result is rarely satisfactory.  Except in rare cases, there will be the seams in between the tiles and the image will be highly repetitive.

===Stochastic texture synthesis===
Stochastic texture synthesis methods produce an image by randomly choosing colour values for each pixel, only influenced by basic parameters like minimum brightness, average colour or maximum contrast. These algorithms perform well with stochastic textures only, otherwise they produce completely unsatisfactory results as they ignore any kind of structure within the sample image.

===Single purpose structured texture synthesis===
Algorithms of that family use a fixed procedure to create an output image, i. e. they are limited to a single kind of structured texture. Thus, these algorithms can both only be applied to structured textures and only to textures with a very similar structure. For example, a single purpose algorithm could produce high quality texture images of stonewalls; yet, it is very unlikely that the algorithm will produce any viable output if given a sample image that shows pebbles.

===Chaos mosaic===
This method, proposed by the Microsoft group for internet graphics, is a refined version of tiling and performs the following three steps:
# The output image is filled completely by tiling. The result is a repetitive image with visible seams.
# Randomly selected parts of random size of the sample are copied and pasted randomly onto the output image. The result is a rather non-repetitive image with visible seams.
# The output image is filtered to smooth edges.
The result is an acceptable texture image, which is not too repetitive and does not contain too many artifacts. Still, this method is unsatisfactory because the smoothing in step 3 makes the output image look blurred.

=== Pixel-based texture synthesis ===

These methods, using Markov fields,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texturesynthesis.com/nonparaMRF.htm "Texture synthesis via a noncausal nonparametric multiscale Markov random field." Paget and Longstaff, IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; non-parametric sampling,&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/EfrosLeung.html "Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling." Efros and Leung, ICCV, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; tree-structured vector quantization&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture-synthesis-sig00/ "Fast Texture Synthesis using Tree-structured Vector Quantization" Wei and Levoy SIGGRAPH 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; and image analogies&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrl.nyu.edu/projects/image-analogies/ "Image Analogies" Hertzmann et al. SIGGRAPH 2001.]&lt;/ref&gt; are some of the simplest and most successful general texture synthesis algorithms.  They typically synthesize a texture in scan-line order by finding and copying pixels with the most similar local neighborhood as the synthetic texture.  These methods are very useful for image completion.  They can be constrained, as in [[Image analogy|image analogies]], to perform many interesting tasks.  They are typically accelerated with some form of Approximate Nearest Neighbor method since the exhaustive search for the best pixel is somewhat slow.  The synthesis can also be performed in multiresolution, such as through use of a noncausal nonparametric multiscale Markov random field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texturesynthesis.com/nonparaMRF.htm "Texture synthesis via a noncausal nonparametric multiscale Markov random field." Paget and Longstaff, IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Imagequilting.gif|thumb|Image quilting.]]

=== Patch-based texture synthesis ===

Patch-based texture synthesis creates a new texture by copying and stitching together textures at various offsets, similar to the use of the [[clone tool]] to manually synthesize a texture. [[Image quilting]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/quilting.html "Image Quilting." Efros and Freeman.  SIGGRAPH 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; and graphcut textures&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-static.cc.gatech.edu/gvu/perception//projects/graphcuttextures/  "Graphcut Textures: Image and Video Synthesis Using Graph Cuts." Kwatra et al. SIGGRAPH 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; are the best known patch-based texture synthesis algorithms.  These algorithms tend to be more effective and faster than pixel-based texture synthesis methods.

=== Deep Learning and Neural Network Approaches ===
More  recently,  [[deep learning]]  methods  were  shown  to  be a  powerful,  fast  and  data-driven,  parametric  approach  to texture  synthesis.   The  work  of  Leon Gatys&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Gatys|first=Leon A.|last2=Ecker|first2=Alexander S.|last3=Bethge|first3=Matthias|date=2015-05-27|title=Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks|eprint=1505.07376|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a  milestone: he and his co-authors  showed  that  filters  from  a  discriminatively trained deep neural network can be used as effective parametric  image  descriptors, leading to a novel texture synthesis method.

Another recent development is the use of generative models for texture synthesis. The Spatial  GAN&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Jetchev|first=Nikolay|last2=Bergmann|first2=Urs|last3=Vollgraf|first3=Roland|date=2016-11-24|title=Texture Synthesis with Spatial Generative Adversarial Networks|eprint=1611.08207|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt;  method showed  for the first time the use of fully unsupervised [[Generative adversarial network|GANs]] for texture synthesis. In a subsequent work,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Bergmann|first=Urs|last2=Jetchev|first2=Nikolay|last3=Vollgraf|first3=Roland|date=2017-05-18|title=Learning Texture Manifolds with the Periodic Spatial GAN|eprint=1705.06566|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt; the method was extended further—PSGAN can learn both periodic and non-periodic images in an unsupervised way from single images or large datasets of images. In  addition, flexible sampling in the noise space allows to create novel textures of potentially infinite output size, and smoothly transition between them. This makes PSGAN unique with  respect  to  the  types  of  images  a  texture synthesis method can create.

==Implementations==
Some texture synthesis implementations exist as [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] for the free image editor [[GIMP|Gimp]]:

==Literature==
Several of the earliest and most referenced papers in this field include:
* [http://xenia.media.mit.edu/~popat/personal/ Popat] in 1993 - "Novel cluster-based probability model for texture synthesis, classification, and compression".
* [http://www.cns.nyu.edu/heegerlab/index.php?page=publications&amp;id=heeger-siggraph95 Heeger-Bergen] in 1995 - "Pyramid based texture analysis/synthesis".
* [http://www.texturesynthesis.com/papers/Paget_IP_1998.pdf Paget-Longstaff] in 1998 - "Texture synthesis via a noncausal nonparametric multiscale Markov random field"
* [http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/NPS/efros-iccv99.pdf Efros-Leung] in 1999 - "Texture Synthesis by Non-parametric Sampling".
* [http://graphics.stanford.edu/papers/texture-synthesis-sig00/ Wei-Levoy] in 2000 - "Fast Texture Synthesis using Tree-structured Vector Quantization"

although there was also earlier work on the subject, such as
* Gagalowicz and Song De Ma in 1986, "Model driven synthesis of natural textures for 3-D scenes",
* Lewis in 1984, "Texture synthesis for digital painting".
(The latter algorithm has some similarities to the Chaos Mosaic approach).

The non-parametric sampling approach of Efros-Leung is the first approach that can easily synthesis most types of texture, and it has inspired literally hundreds of follow-on papers in computer graphics.  Since then, the field of texture synthesis has rapidly expanded with the introduction of 3D graphics accelerator cards for personal computers.  It turns out, however, that [[Scott Draves]] first published the patch-based version of this technique along with GPL code in 1993 according to [http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/people/efros/research/synthesis.html Efros].

{{nihongo|'''Institute for Research in Humanities, Kyoto University'''|京都大学人文科学研究所|Kyōto Daigaku Jinbun Kagaku Kenkyūjo}} is an institution for research into the humanities and ethno-ecological studies. It has a distinctive school tradition, as heir to the philosophically-oriented [[Kyoto School]], but differs from the latter in its broader cultural interests.&lt;ref&gt;Much of this article will be translated from the equivalent article [[:ja:京都大学人文科学研究所]], in the Japanese Wikipedia, as retrieved on June 24, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turkology''' (or '''Turcology''') is a complex of humanities sciences studying languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and [[ethnology]] of people speaking [[Turkic languages]] and [[Turkic peoples]] in chronological and comparative context. This includes ethnic groups from the [[Sakha people|Sakha]] in East [[Siberia]] to the [[Balkan]] Turks and [[Gagauz people|Gagauz]] in [[Moldova]].

==History==
Ethnological information on Turkic tribes for the first time was systemized by the 11th-century Turkic philologist [[Mahmud al-Kashgari]] in the ''Dīwān ul-Lughat it-Turk'' (Dictionary of Turkic language). Multi-lingual dictionaries were compiled from the late 13th century for the practical application of participants in international trade and political life: Kipchak (Cuman)-Persian-Latin-German  ''Codex Cumanicus'', ''Armenian-Kipchak'', and ''Russian-Kipchak'' dictionaries. By the Middle Ages the Turkology was centred around [[Byzantium|Byzantine]]/[[Greece|Greek]] historians, ambassadors and travelers, and geographers.  In the 15th-17th centuries the main subject of Turkology was the study of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Turkish language]], and the Turkic languages of [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Western Asia]]. In 1533 a first hand-written primer appeared, and by 1612 a printed grammar by Jerome Megizer was published, followed by [[Francisci a Mesgnien Meninski|F. Mesgnien-Meninski]]'s 4-volume ''Thesaurus Linguarum Orientalium'' published in 1680.

P. S. Pallas initiated a more scientific approach to Turkology with his ''Comparative dictionaries of all languages and dialects'' (1787) which included lexical materials from Tatar, Mishar, Nogai, Bashkir, and other Türkic languages. In the 19th century, Turkology was further developed by M. A. Kazembek's ''Grammar of the Turkish-Tatar language'' (1839), O. N. Betlingk ''Grammar of the Yakut language'' (1851). A major achievement was the deciphering at the end of the 19th century of the Early Middle Age [[Old Turkic script|Orkhon]] inscriptions by [[V. Thomsen]] and [[W. W. Radloff]] (1895). By the end of the 19th century, Turkology developed into a complex discipline that included linguistics, history, ethnology, archeology, arts and literature. In the 20th century the Turkology complex included physical anthropology, numismatics, genetics, ancient Turkic alphabetic scripts, typology, genesis, and etymology, onomastics and toponymy. The appearance of ''Türkische Bibliothek'' (1905–27) inaugurated specialised periodicals, followed by ''Mitteilungen zur Osmanischen Geschichte'' (1921–26). Scientific developments allowed calibrated dating, dendrochronology, metallurgy, chemistry, textile, and other specialized disciplines which contributed to the development of the Turkological studies. Deeper study of the ancient sources allowed better understanding of economical, social, mythological and cultural forces of the sedentary and nomadic societies. Linguistic studies uncovered pre-literate symbioses and mutual influences between different peoples.

===Persecution in Soviet Russia===

On 9 August 1944 the Central Committee VKP(b), the ruling party of the USSR, published an edict prohibiting "ancientization" of Turkic history. The edict was followed by a consecutive wave of mass arrests, imprisoning and killing of the [[intelligentsia]], massive creation of replacement "scientists", and re-writing of history pages on an industrial scale. Combined with the concurrent wholesale deportation of indigenous populations to remote areas in [[Middle Asia]] and [[Siberia]], the wipe-out of the science was nearly complete, and the impact of the action subsided only partially in the newly independent countries after the collapse of the USSR. In the two decades after the [[Bolshevik]]'s assuming power, the tradition of Turkological studies in Russia and dependent countries was practically [[Suppressed research in the Soviet Union|wiped out]].

On the other hand, this edict brought unintended benefits to Turkology. One was the nearly immediate linguistic development of an alternate lexicon which replaced the nouns and adjectives containing the word "Türk" by a wealth of euphemisms: "nomads, Siberians, Paleosiberians, Middle Asians, Scythians, Altaians, Tuvians", etc. that filled scientific publications. The other was "writing into a drawer", when results of the years of fruitful work were written down for future publication. When the bonds relaxed, the publications exploded. Another was a flight of scientists from European Russia into remote areas, which brought first class scientists to many intellectually starved outlying areas of Middle Asia. Another one was connected with the statewide efforts to re-invent the history, when a wealth of Turkological facts were found in the process of search for "correct" history. And another one was a built-up of the public interest for the forbidden subjects, that resulted that no print size could satisfy the demand. [[Lev Gumilev|L.N.Gumilev]] and [[Olzhas Suleimenov|O.Suleimenov]] inflamed a surge in the new generation of Turkology scholars.

With the physical culling of the scholars from the society, concurrently was also organized a total extermination of all their published and unpublished works, their books were removed from the libraries and destroyed from private collections by intimidated population, articles and publications were culled, published photographs were retouched, private photographs were destroyed, published scientific references were erased, or publications with undesired references were destroyed. Very few of the early 20th century expedition diaries, ethnographical notes, reports and drafts for publications were ever recovered.

'''ZipcodeZoo''' is a free, online encyclopedia intended to document all living [[species]] and [[infraspecies]] known to science. It is compiled from existing databases. It offers one page for each living species, supplementing text with video, sound, and images where available.

ZipcodeZoo is an online [[database]] that collects the [[natural history]], [[Biological classification|classification]], [[species]] characteristics, [[conservation biology]], and [[Range (biology)|distribution]] [[information]] of thousands of species and [[infraspecies]].  It includes over 800,000 [[photographs]], 50,000 [[video]]s, 160,000 [[media clip|sound clip]]s, and 3.2 million [[map]]s describing nearly 3.2 million species and infraspecies.

The site and its sister site lookup.life include a number of specialized search functions, such as identifying a bird species from its color, shape and other traits, including where it was seen; or generating a list of plants or animals likely to be found in or near a specific location (a zipcode, state, country, latitude/longitude, etc.). The searches can be restricted to specific taxa, or broad categories like reptiles or fish. A sound trainer can play multiple bird song recordings simultaneously.

ZipcodeZoo draws on the [[Catalogue of Life]] for its basic species list, the [[Global Biodiversity Information Facility]] for its maps, [[Flickr]] for many of its photos, [[YouTube]] for videos, [[Xeno-canto]] for some of its sound recordings, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature|IUCN]] for conservation status, and other major sources.&lt;ref&gt;such as the [http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/ Taxonomicon] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090824160507/http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/ |date=August 24, 2009 }} for taxonomic information.&lt;/ref&gt;
